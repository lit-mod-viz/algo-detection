EIGHTH SITUATION 39

though the subject is Celtic) was long forbidden “for
fear” of irritating a half—dozen illiterate French
chauvinists; an inﬁnite number of other plays "for
fear” oi annoying Germany (or our parlor diplomats
who talk of it) . . . . Yet others “for fear” of vexing
the Grand Turk!

Is it possible, notwithstanding all this, to ﬁnd a
single instance in which a dramatic production has
brought about a national calamity such as our censors
fear? The pretext is no more sincere than are those
urged for excluding from the theater any frank and
truthful representations of love. A rule against
admitting children should be sufﬁcient to satisfy
modesty on this point; even that is little needed, since
children unaccompanied by their elders rarely apply for
admission.

Our sentimental bourgeoisie apparently holds to the
eighteenth-century opinion that it is more dangerous
to listen to these things in public than to read of them
in private. For our dramatic art—‘which, be it noted,
has remained, despite its decline, the one' great un-
rivalled means of propagating French thought
throughout Europe—has been forbidden, little by little,
to touch directly upon theology, politics, sociology,
upon criminals or crimes, excepting (and pray why
this exception ?) adultery, upon which subject our
theater, to its great misfortune, now lives, at least two
days out of three. ’

The ancients had a saying that a man enslaved loses
half his son]. A dramatist is a man.
