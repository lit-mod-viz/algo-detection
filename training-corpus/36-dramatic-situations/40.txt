SEVENTH SITUATION ‘ _
FALLING PREY TO CRUELTY OR MISFORTUNE

(Elements: an Unfortunate; a Master or a
Misfortune)

To inﬁnite sorrow there is no limit. Beneath that
which seems the ﬁnal depth of misfortune, there may
open another yet more frightful. A ferocious and
deliberate dissection of the heart it seems, this Seventh
Situation,—that of pessimism par excellence.

A—The Innocent Made the Victim of Ambitious
lntrigue:——“The Princess Maleine" (Maeterlinck);
“The Natural Daughter," by Goethe; “Les Deux
Jumeaux,” by Hugo,

B—The Innocent Despoiled by Those Who Should
Protectz—“The Guests" and the beginning of the
“Joueurs d’Osselets," by Aeschylus (at the ﬁrst vibra-
tion of the great bow in the hands of the unknown
Beggar, what a breath of hope we draw!); “Les Cor-
beaux” by Becque; “Le Roi de Rome” (Pouvillon);
“L’Aiglon” (Rostand); “La Croisade des Enfantelets
Francs" (Ernault):

v-I-HC (1)-——The Powerful Dispossessed and Wretched:
-——The beginning of Sophocles’ and of Euripides’
“Peleus”; of “Prometheus Bound"; of “Job.” Laertes
in his garden. Example from comefly: “Le Jan de la
Feuillée” (Adam de 1g. Halle).

(2)—A Favorite or an Intimate Finds Himself For-
gotten:—“En Détresse” (Fevre, 1890).
