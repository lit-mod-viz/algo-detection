d’Auvergne. For the Happiness of Ones People:—
The “Suffering Christ” of St. Gregory Nazianzen.

(3)—Life Sacriﬁced in Filial Piety:——”The Phoenic-
ian Women" by Aeschylus‘; the “Antigones” of
Sophocles and Euripides; of Alamanni and Alﬁeri.

“Vive le Roi” I Tan Rymer, 1911) ; “Cesar Birotteau”
(Fabre, after Balzac, 1911) ; “The Constant Pn‘nce” by

B (1)———Both Love and'Life Sacriﬁced for Ones
Faith: — “Polyeucte.” In ﬁction “L'Evangeliste”
(sacriﬁce of family and future for ones faith).

(2)—~—Both Love and Life Sacriﬁced to a Cause:—
“Les Fils de Jahel” (Mme. Armand, 1886).

(3)—Love Sacriﬁced to Interests of State:—This is
the favorite motif of Corneille, as in “0thon,” “Ser-
torius,” “Sophonisbe,” “Pulcherie,” “Tite et Bérénice.”
Add to these the “Bérénice” of Racine arid the “Sophon-
isbe” of Trissino, that of Alﬁeri and that of Mairet;
Metastasio’s “Achilles in Scyro” and his “Dido;" Ber-
lioz’ “Troyons” (the best tragedy of his century);
“L’Impératrice” (Mendes). The “Creditor" in this
sub-elass, remaining abstract, is easily confounded
with the Ideal and the Hero; the “Persons Sacriﬁced,"
on the contrary, become visible; these are Plautine,
Viriate, Syphax and Massinisse, Bérénice, Déidamie.
In comedy: “S. A. R.” (Chancel, 1908). ,

C—Sacriﬁce of WeIl-Being ‘o Duty: “Resurrection”
by Tolstoi; “L’Apprentie” (Geﬂ'roy, 1908).
