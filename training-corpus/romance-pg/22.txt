PLOT GENIE ROMANCE

blood,“ is melodramatic because it is. sensational, exaggerated and unreal.
Richard Schayer, Scenario Editor’in'Chief of Universal Studios was
another celebrated authority who gave me an interesting version of the
subject. Here is what he says:

“The terms “Drama" and ”Melo’Drama“ are used indiscrimiw
acely by people who do not know what they mean. The original
of the term “Melovama” was in an early type of play accomv
panied by or interspersed with music~~hence “Mela."

“On the American stage the term “‘MelorDrama" was applied to
all of those oldvfashicmed action plays in which the course of the
story was periodically interrupted with specialties in the form of
song and' dance acts. Gradually, however, the term was given a
deeper signiﬁcance.

“MeloeDrama” today stands for the type of drama in which the
plot controls the characters and true drama is a play in which the
characters, through their very character, control the plot. In other
words, in a real “MeloDrama” there is a hero, a heroine, a villain,
and some subsidiary characters, a few of Whom are comedy relief.
These characterizations are rubber stamped and there is no real
development of character throughout the piece. True drama is the
unfoiding of character and its modiﬁcation through a series of events,

“What we call tragedy on the screen is usually merely a sad
ending to a story. Real tragedy on the screen is the same as on the
stage—a group of characters enmeshed in an inevitable chain 0f cir’
cumstances leading inexorably to a tragic finish.”

In the selection of locale, characters, situations and human traits for
the lists and Formula in this Index, great care has been exercised to EKIII'
inate everything of a melodramatic nature. However; the operator must
bear in mind in dealing with human activities Which are prompted by
selfish desires, it is an extremely difﬁcult matter to totally eliminate melcv
drama and therefore it is necessary for one to watch his TREATMENT
of the story p101: outlines suggested by this Formula where melodrama
seems inclined to creep in.
