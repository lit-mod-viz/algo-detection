momentary hesitancy part individual eventually everyone followed dark opening
advanced fifty sixty foot without making sort dis covery
bat disturbed glare lantern darted blindly head
suddenly sheriff stopped
look commanded pointed downward

interior cave arose sudden wild shriek terror followed hideous mouth ing gibbering distinctly human
remembered two men lingered behind
snatching lantern dashed mouth cave fol lowed closely chatham one two others

martin rea soned would enjoy tramping prioh ards wood fall new england countryside take mel low beauty conducive easing shattered nerve
recall preparation coming seems like grim joke
careful rigging room insure quiet even sent town noiseless portable place regular typewriter
martin arrived late gust sick man

smoked much held cigarette gray spiral rose tip unevenly trembling hand
best conceal con cern changed appearance
working novel try ing hold librarian job dur ing day

amazing creative effort man martin peculiar temperament drained dry sucked vitality though night given visit vampire suc cubus rather writing
isnt bad comparison martin aylethorp wrote weird fiction
wrote intensely theory mine writing fantasy took author work field

bottomless pool doubt said
kind place
martin assumed look melodra matic grimness

strange place george graf warned stay away told wed
grownup ever spoke called place bottomless pool
mentioned walden pond concord place thoreau wrote nature study know said bottomless
lie hollow hill nei ther inlet outlet yet water always fresh
spring subter ranean river cause doubt glacier created queer freak hereabouts

thats meant bottomless pool said one prichards wood similar
well warning whetted interest spot see
kid like guess
got together fishline gang could lay hand tied together lead weight one end
lowered sluggish black pool swamp
never struck bottom
well sort scared creepy place took warning seriously
never gone back
last summer concord gradually lost track boy
hear something letter sam dewey disappearing swamp following year
sam lad suggested take sound ings
course dont think dis appearance anything interest bottomless pool although might
foolhardy george graf warning hinted something people fallen
listened sort tepid interest
martin seemed genuinely enthusiastic
let take look place urged
really weird spot ive got hunch there story somewhere
rose obediently put boot
solitary wandering avoided mucky wooded depth old swamp humor guest acceded request struck south soon reached swamp edge

strange story martin beckoning turned followed meandering wooden line came willow tree bent ground
deep dark shade ancient bough lay bottomless pool
small barely six foot across black
jet black water motion le

thats highly fantastic comparison something pool pearance inspired thought

martin stood looking depth moment

martin ever imaginative dozen fantastic theory
fished depth bot tomless pool
hook
thing lived pool
maybe thing
somethings fished men
boy hadnt george graf bottomless pool hinted disappearance
hadnt sam dewey vanished near swamp
something pool set trap men putting lizard hook using wire line
bot tomless pool led inner earth life
thus martin expressed halfseriously
offered obvious ply
hook line used fisherman
fallen water
perhaps lizard accidentally impaled upon hook risen surface died brought line
grabbed got hooked snag entangling line end water pulled pool
second lizard saw
martin insinuated gently
silent
martin grave moment fore continuing

boat rocked
nine time smart fisher man
hooked big pickerel day pickerel hooked
gave uncomprehending glance

line got wrapped around foot fish pulled boat laughed
graver tone went fish wanted catch fisherman tangle line
take bot tomless pool example
