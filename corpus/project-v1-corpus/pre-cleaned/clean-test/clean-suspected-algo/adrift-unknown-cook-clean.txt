LOST STRAYED OR STOLEN
There could be no more fitting introduction to this most amazingnarrative from the pen of James Peter Munn than that article in theMorning Mercury
Munn it is no breach of confidence to inform the reader was reformedburglar although the author of two books which achieved large sales andwere most favorably received by the reviewersForty Ways of CrackingSafes and The Sandbaggers ManualMr
Munn developed small skill withthe pen so that the breathless interest aroused by his revelationshangs more upon the matter than the style
The Mercury article shoulddo its mite toward preparing the reader for what is to come
In the first place the story was what newspaper men call scoop
The article in the first edition ran as follows QUINNS CASTLE VANISHES
AND SO DOES QUINN
WITH HOUSE AND BELONGINGS
THE HARLEM SAGE DISAPPEARS IN SINGLE HOUR
LEAVING NOT TRACE BEHIND
What happened to Professor Quinn last night
And what happened to the strange steel structure known locally among Harlem residents as Quinns Castle
For Quinn and his castle were snuffed out like candlegleam some time between the hours of eleven oclock and midnight
Patrolman Casey who travels beat in that part of Harlem avers that he passed the castle at eleven oclock and that it was there he passed its site again at twelve and it was not there
Considerably exercised Patrolman Casey made search for the castle and although he beat up the country for dozen blocks in all directions he failed to find it
And what is more Patrolman Casey declares that he took the pledge when he went on the force and has been total abstainer ever since
Corroboration of the officers report is not lacking
Certain residents of the vicinity state that they saw the professors weird dwelling yesterday evening its windows were aglow and it appeared evident that the professor was entertaining friends
The first gray dawn this morning showed bare lot with the steel house missing
Is it another case of Aladdins palace dissolving into thin air at the presto
of some wonder worker
Or is it plain case of larceny undertaken on gigantic scale
golden opportunity offers itself to sleuth of the Sherlock Holmes school and for such person the Mercury presents the following facts First the socalled castle was projectileshaped of boilerplate construction and measured some twenty feet in diameter tapering to point thirty feet above ground
It was covered with sort of paint that gave it the appearance of frosted silver
Second there is much low shrubbery surrounding the site of the castle and if the castle had been blown down and rolled from the ridge it stood on into the river there would have been left evidences in plenty of such disaster
Note The castle certainly weighed five tons possibly five times that
Nothing short of cyclone could have budged it and there was hardly breath of air stirring the whole night long
Third Professor Quinn ever since he erected his steel house and moved into it has been regarded as mildly insane
Like AboubenAdhem he desired to be entered on the angelic scroll as one who loved his fellowmen
Last summer he read before the Astronomical Society paper entitled The Mutability of Newtonian Law and was laughed out of that honorable body for his inconsistencies
Although adverted to as The Harlem Sage Professor Quinn is no Merlin nor does he possess the ring of Gyges that rendered its wearer invisible
Yet where is he
And where is his castle
Until some Vidocq appears and solves the mystery echo can only answer Where
So much for the article in the first printing of the paper
The brightyoung man who stood sponsor for the scoop had meanwhile been very busywith fresh details and the second edition contained the followingaddenda It has just been learned that Mr Emmet Gilhooly the multimillionaire and president of the railroad combine was guest of Professor Quinn last night and must have been in the castle at the very moment it faded into oblivion
Mr Gilhooly did not return to his home and has not since been heard from
His relatives are distracted and leading railroad men of the country are in panic
His absence from affairs at the present moment jeopardizes the traction interests of the entire country and may prove deathblow to the success of the gigantic pool he was forming
This was startling news indeed and sped hither and yon throughout thecity the country and the civilized world
Appalling as theinformation was nevertheless it proved merely fractional part of thetruth
The bright reporter on the Mercury made further discoveries whichwere printed in the third edition rushed from the presses of his paper
Not only was Mr Emmet Gilhooly guest of Professor Quinn in the steel castle last night but so also were Hon
Augustus Popham the coal baron Archibald Meigs of Wall Street late manipulator of the corner in wheat and now engineering corner in cotton and Hannibal Markham well known as the instigator of plot to control the food supply of the United States
What has become of these four millionaires and Napoleons of finance
They have gone with Quinn and his castle disappearing as utterly as though the earth had opened and swallowed them
Fabulous rewards were offered by the relatives of the missingmillionaires for any information relative to the fate that had overtakenthem
Foul play was suspected and the financial world stood aghast anddumbly wondered what was to happen to the business of the country if itreally developed beyond all peradventure that Gilhooly Popham Meigsand Markham had been eliminated from commercial affairs
The influence of these four was vast and farreaching and they werescheming to make their grip on the republics resources even more secureand relentless
If their plans carried no man could eat or clothehimself or warm his body and drive his manufacturing engines or travelfrom place to place and ship the product of his mills without payingtribute to Gilhooly Popham Meigs and Markham
Should those schemestitanic in conception be worked out to their manifest conclusion fourmen would hold the destiny of industrial America in the hollow of theirhands
Prosperity would wait upon their pleasure or at mere nodwould be paralyzed and leave the country stranded on the reefs ofdisaster
It seemed an odd fatality that at the very time thesecommandersinchief of industry were plotting to make their powercomplete they should have vanished as utterly as though they had beenengulfed by tidal wave and swept into the broad regions of theAtlantic
few facts were brought to light through the probing ofskilled detective minds but these facts were in nowise clues to thefate that had overtaken the millionaires
Pophams confidential aide reluctantly admitted that his chief hadaccepted an invitation from Quinn and had gone to his castle for aninterview
Quinn professed to have made some discovery or other whichhe declared would make coal useless commodity so far as human needswere concerned
Popham while laughing at Quinns pretensions wasnevertheless secretly worried
Anything that threatened the success ofthe coup which was being engineered by himself and his three confrereswas to be dealt with decisively and without loss of time
In the case of Meigs Markham and Gilhooly there was no confidentialaide to offer testimony for these bright particular stars of highfinance had placed limit on the confidence reposed in theirsecretaries
Nevertheless the probing minds at work on the casedeveloped the extraordinary fact that these men no less than Pophamhad visited Quinn at the latters request
spirit of scoffinginvestigation animated them but they were prepared to see with theirown eyes and hear with their own ears whatever Quinn had to show and tosay
If anything that militated against their projected coup wasbrought before them they would proceed to lay the spectre forthwith
Strangely enough the shrewdest of the detectives failed to connect thedisappearance of the millionaires with the comprehensive plans they wereforming and which could not be carried out except by the plotters inperson
Other rich men of the country who were wont to trim their sails inaccordance with whatever wind blew from the offices of The Four in WallStreet were already shifting affairs to lay course that would givethem the best headway against the projected new order
This suddendisappearance of the powers to which the lesser rich looked for guidanceleft them becalmed in an uncharted sea
The middle class long accustomed to being mulcted right and leftaccepted the astonishing situation with equanimity
So far as they wereconcerned Gilhooly Popham Meigs and Markham were abstractgeneralitiesmerely names to conjure with
For years the middle classhad paid for the conjuring and had been taught to look calmly into theeyes of what they had come to believe was the inevitable
If theirannual outing to the seashore or the mountains cost too much they couldstay at home if the butcher the baker and the grocer ran prices toohigh some of the luxuries could be cut out if anthracite went to aton they would heat fewer rooms and if clothing became too expensivethere would be fewer suits and gowns to wear
By little selfdenialthe middle class also could trim their sails to any gale that blew
They were used to it
With the poor it was different
They were already down to bedrock inthe way of selfdenial
No sooner had it drifted through their brainsthat the influence of Gilhooly Popham Meigs and Markham had beenblotted out than they lifted their voices in praise of the blessedevent
Their situation had been bad enough and any change among thevaguely understood causes presiding over their affairs could hardly befor the worse
The detectives feeling that they were at work on particularly complexcase hampered themselves by looking for complex causes
At first theybelieved it was matter of sequestration and that presently ransom inseven or eight figures would be called for
However delving intoQuinns past failed to reveal any lawless actions that would point to aransom in his present line of endeavor
The detectives growing morecomplex as the ambiguities closed them in overlooked entirely thesimplicity of Quinns character
Anyhow one analytical mind would demand of another what had Quinnsintentions to do with the disappearance
That was positive reality
And although it was surmised it was not definitely known that Quinnhimself had had anything to do with it
Such was the situation confronting the country and with which the policedepartment of New York City was called upon to deal
But the keenestreasoning inductive or deductive was powerless to find even clue
The tremendous mystery might have remained mystery until this day hadit not been for the narrative of James Peter Munn now for the firsttime given to the world
CHAPTER II
AN UNINVITED GUEST
used to be one of those who claimed that the world owed him livingand went out with drill and jimmy to collect it
Where was the difference argued between the man who cracks yourstrong box and removes few paltry bills or coins and the nabob whoskulks behind trust and takes his tax on the necessities of life
This was pure sophistry of course but became wedded to it in earlylife and that escaped suit of stripes and measurement on theBertillon system is due entirely to my experiences with ProfessorQuinn
Twas blessed night that sent me to his castle with the view ofmulcting it of treasures felt to be there
Quinn was queer one
Ido not mean to say that he was unhinged as some thought but he wasqueer in his outlook upon life and in resources which fall under thehead of ways and means
His castle claimed my professional attention
For why should man builda big steel vault and live in it unless he had portable property worth aburglars while
reconnoitered the place for week before Iconsidered myself possessed of sufficient knowledge for my undertaking
In view of what transpired at the time of my visit brief descriptionof the castle taken from my memorandum book will prove of interest
The structure was cigarshaped twentynine feet from base to apex andtwenty feet in diameter through its largest part
It was divided intotwo stories by means of steel floor leaving headroom of ten feet inthe lower story
Four windows pierced the circular walls of the nether room and two gavelight to the room above these six openings being guarded on the outersides with latticework of steel
The door was an oblong piece of boiler platethe entire building was ashell composed of plates riveted togetherhinged heavily and providedwith strong lock
As had yet to find lock which could not pickif given time enough my designs naturally centred about the door
had hit upon the somewhat early hour of ten in the evening for my callat the professors
Unless business kept him abroad knew that he wasusually in bed long before that time
If he chanced to be out so muchthe better for the success of my foray
After the patrolman had passed crept through the bushes and was soonbusy with the lock on the steel door
It yielded with much lessresistance than had anticipated and was quickly within flashing mybullseye lantern about me
circular seat upholstered in leather ran around the wall and tablebearing an unlighted oil lamp stood in the centre of the floor
hadbarely completed hasty survey when crunch of footsteps on thegraveled walk without smote on my ears
Without loss of moment snapped the lantern shut and darted up theiron stairway to the room above
It is needless to say that was verymuch put out because of the interruption
was hard man in thosedays and such an occurrence was apt to anger me and make me say things
Lying flat on the floor with my face to the stair opening had afairly good view of the circular chamber below
The professor had beenabroad and not in bed for he appeared now ushering in callers
Four gentlemen all of distinguished mien and important bearingfollowed the owner of the castle and began glancing about withillconcealed amusement
Gad but this is an odd place
exclaimed one
This gentleman wore frock coat and silk hat but what caught my eyewas fourcarat spark in his scarf massive seal on his fob and ascintillating gem on the third finger of his left hand
Odd perhaps returned the professor but most suitable to mypurposes Mr Gilhooly as hope to show you before many minutes havepassed
Be seated sir
And the rest of you gentlemen you will findthe divan most comfortable
went hot and cold at that name
Nearly everybody in NewYork was just then talking about the man who was scheming to makerailroad travel too expensive for ordinary mortals
He was amillionaire several times over and in the breast of his frock coat Iknew there must be bulky wallet
At once and while watched and listened to those in the room below mymind busied itself with details of more comprehensive operation than Ihad at first contemplated
The professors four guests had seated themselves on the circular divan
After my eyes had finished with Gilhooly they turned on the other threeand my first impressions were more than confirmed
Each of the quartet was Croesus and dressed and strutted the part
Fine birds indeed and hugged myself to think how opportunity hadcome knocking at my door
Sixshooter in hand could descend upon this covey compel areadjustment of values between them and myself then back through thesteel door lock it behind me and make off
The professor intent on other things no doubt had turned his key inthe lock and had failed to discover that the bolt was already throwntherefore my presence in the castle was entirely unsuspectedmanifestlyan advantage
You have asked us to come here Professor Quinn spoke up one as theprofessor turned higher the wick of the lamp he had just lighted andhere we are
You say you have discovered something whose value toscience and the industrial world is beyond compute and that you wish tointerest capital
Welland the speaker surveyed his three companionswith large smilehere is the capital
shall come at my discovery in due course Mr Popham said theprofessor who was wiry little man with bald head and beadlikeblack eyes
thank you for coming here
Emmet Gilhooly AugustusPopham Archibald Meigs and Hannibal Markham are stars of the firstmagnitude in the skies of speculation and esteem myself fortunate inarousing their interest
faintness seized me as these names each an open sesame to the worldof finance fell glibly from the professors tongue
was all butcheek by jowl with representatives of billions
Augustus Popham turned his head to give Emmet Gilhooly plebeian wink
Gilhooly smiled behind his smooth white hand
Archibald Meigs leanedover to whisper something to Hannibal Markham who was affixing pairof gold eyeglasses to his Roman nose whereupon both gentlemensuppressed titter
doubt of the sincerity of all four broke over me
They were there tohave sport with this bald little man with the beady eyes and the bee inhis bonnet
chuckled grimly as thought of how the tables wouldpresently be turned
do not know whether the professor was as keen asI to detect these evidences of insincerity
If he was he gave no sign
am sixtyfive said he and my life work has been the discoverywhich am about to bring to your august attention
Perhaps some of yougentlemen have read my paper on The Mutability of Newtonian Law
The gentlemen acknowledged that they had not
Professor Quinn seemeddisappointed
If you had read that he continued you would have preparedyourselves for an understanding of my theory and the demonstration of itwhich am about to give
Let me ask you this When an apple leaves itsparent branch why is it that it falls downward instead of upward
The Napoleons of finance stared at one another
Archibald Meigs wentso far as to tap suggestive finger against his forehead
Gravity said the professor
It is that which draws every atom onthe surface of the earth directly toward the earths centre it is thatwhich chains our feet to this planet and keeps us from falling throughinterstellar space it is even that which keeps our little world fromflying apart and dissipating itself in dust throughout the great void
It is simple proposition simply stated and trust you follow me
They did follow him and so signified
In the paper read before the Astronomical Society pursued theprofessor made bold to declare that it was possible to insulate abody against the force of gravitation
In other words to make it soimmune from Newtonian law that it would spurn the earth and fall from itat speed even greater than the drawing power of gravity
Can you not comprehend what this means
cried Quinn waxing eloquent
It means new force in the industrial worlda power that feeds onnothing save law that transcends that of gravitation
In point offact it falls little short of perpetual motion
Without the expenditure of even pound of coal this new force canturn the wheels of every railroad train on the globe
With its owninherent energy it can give life to the machinery of flour mills cottonmills iron foundries it canAugustus Popham got up hurriedly and put on his hat
rattlebrained idea sir
he exclaimed
have no mind to remainhere and listen to such talk
Pophams coal mines ravaged the earths crust in thousand and oneplaces
The idea that human industry could get along without his coalwas too much for him
Before he could reach the door Professor Quinn was in front of himbarring his way
Remember Mr Popham said the professor if were to take away yourmines should yet give you something in their place worth incalculablymore
Hear me out sir
beg of you
Theories are cheap things muttered Popham as he again seatedhimself
An ounce of proof is worth pound of theory
Exactly cried Quinn and the ounce of proof shall be forthcoming
With that he pulled the table from the centre of the room revealing aniron chain some three feet in length attached at its lower end to astaple in the floor by means of clevis and pin
The chain was not lying loosely but was rigidly upright its upper endwound about white blocka sixinch cube as judged
Climbing to the table top the professor stepped thence to the cubepoising himself for moment on one foot
Then he sprang to the flooragain
This cube he explained laying one hand on the block with anaffectionate gesture is of steel and has been treated with myinsulating compound
To all appearance it is falling upward with aforce sufficient to draw the chain rigidly to its full extent and tosupport my weight
muttered the coal baron
exclaimed Meigs
The other two remained silent
They were bewildered perhaps impressed
Let us see whether it is trick or no went on Quinn
Pray comeforward gentlemen and lay hold of the chain
There is no danger inthe little experiment with which am going to amuse you and think itwill dispel your doubts
The gentlemen hesitated but finally came forward got down with somedifficulty and grasped the chain as directed
Hold tight
exclaimed the professor and drew the pin from the clevis
Thus released the cube rose to the ceiling lifting the four gentlemenwith it
They hung in midair until Quinn drew the table under themand they dropped to its top each in turn and so reached the floor
Bewilderment was written large in the faces of the quartet theircredulity struggling against the evidence of their senses
You are good magician sir averred Popham brushing the damp fromhis forehead with handkerchief
You could make your fortune as an entertainer declared Gilhooly
Archibald Meigs chewed briskly on an unlighted cigar while HannibalMarkham kept his eyes on the cube and dangling chain like onefascinated
It is the fate of man who makes startling discoveries to be classedamong disciples in black art observed Quinn calmly
What is thehour Mr
he asked
The head of the railway pool consulted his repeater
Elevenfourteen he replied
And high time was going added Popham
Just few moments more said the professor
Turning to the wall behind him he caught small lever and turned itover as far as it would go
The castle vibrated slightly communicatinga perceptible swaying motion to the pendent chain
Whats this
cried Markham jumping up
Do not be alarmed my friends cried Quinn whirling around
His face was pallid as death and his beady eyes gleamed like coals
Then wonder of wonders the white cube settled to the floor
shouted Popham
Your antigravity compound is not very longlived it seems to me
You will find differently to your cost
returned the professorthrough his teeth
Augustus Popham Kenward Quinn arraign you andEmmet Gilhooly and Archibald Meigs and Hannibal Markham as foes ofthe human race
You are leeches who would suck the lifeblood from theveins of the poorWith steady forefinger Quinn had transfixed each of the plutocrats ashe called his name
Markham was already on his feet and the other threewere not slow in following him
Whats this whats this
gasped Gilhooly
An insult
muttered Popham
The old addlepate is not accountable for what he says or doesremarked Archibald Meigs
We had best leave this steel trap of his while there is yet timecounseled Markham
While there is yet time
repeated Quinn with wild laugh
prettyset of conspirators you are on my soul
Markham there would raisethe price of food until the poor would go hungry you Meigs would somanipulate the cost of clothing that they would not have the wherewithalto cover their nakedness Popham would make fuel luxury of the richand Gilhooly would so boost passenger and freight rates as to quadrupleto the consumer the tremendous cost of the necessities of life
Deny meif you can if you dare
Quinn looked like Nemesis as he confronted the four men and lashedthem with his scorpion whip of words
exclaimed Popham
We deserve it said Meigs for it was the height of folly for us tocome here in the first place
Is this why you brought us here
asked Markham to air your ownparticular ideas on sociology and to make us the victims of your abuse
The professor threw back his head and straightened his shoulders
Itwas the real thing in dignity that he showed those plutocrats and mynerves tingled with admiration
was sorry had come to the castlewith designs oh Quinns portable property and doubly glad that couldforce tribute from these four who were badgering him
am not unjust averred the professor and such thing as abuse isfarthest from my mind but love the plain people the bone and sinewof this glorious republic and it arouses my indignation when the rightto live and let live is trampled upon by any one man or set of men
sneered Popham
To call truth platitude is witless argument answered Quinnserenely
Be that as it may said Meigs we were not invited here for debatebut to witness demonstration of what you were pleased to term arevolutionizing discovery
You have seen me overcome the force of gravity went on the professorand to astute minds like yours further explanation seems uncalled for
In destroying gravity produce power equalled by no other force inthe world
The pull of an insulated block the size of that oneandhere he waved his hand toward the cubeis equal to the strength of ahundred horses
Develop that pull horizontally instead of verticallyand we have locomotive that runs continuously without the consumptionof pound of coal
That cried the professor his voice ringing withtriumph is the apotheosis of power
Gilhooly judging from his manner was the victim of uncomfortablethoughts Meigs wore startled look and Markham seemed half convinced
Popham alone was brusque and uncompromising
think we had better get out of here again suggested Markham
Hishalf convictions appeared to arouse some small amount of apprehension
Im of the same opinion spoke up Meigs
Wait little suggested Popham and saw gleam in his eyes thatmeant stroke of some kind
Once more he faced Quinn
have nopatience with your harebrained theories he went on and have seencharlatans work greater wonders than what you are pleased to call yourdemonstration But it is business principle of mine to buy up thesepromising theories if they happen to run counter to any pet scheme amtrying to put through
Sir rather than be annoyed further with thischimerical idea of yours will pay five thousand dollars spot cashjust to have you give over your notions and quit experimenting
Professor Quinn laughed
Five thousand dollars
he exclaimed then added as though to himselfHe would have me sell the welfare and happiness of the people for fivethousand dollars
will add another five thousand to Pophams offer
put in Gilhoolynot because am afraid your discoveries will upset the transportationinterests of the country but simply to clear the commercial atmosphereand keep your visionary ideas from affecting the price of stocks
Let me add another five thousand said Meigs
dont see how yourinvention even if it is all you claim for it could affect me or myinterests one way or the other but will add my contribution simplybecause Popham has taken the initiative
Count me in for the same amount supplemented Markham on thecondition that Professor Quinn signs over to the four of us all hisright title and interest in his nongravity invention and covenants toleave that field entirely alone in future
Quinn seemed to enjoy these propositions and it was apparent at aglance that he had no intention of accepting twenty thousand dollars andrenouncing his discoveries
Gentlemen said he you are already half convinced that am nodreamer for you are financiers and while twenty thousand dollars isno more to you than twenty cents is to me it is not your habit to giveyour money away
repeat that you are inclined to have faith in meand before many minutes shall have made your belief in my abilitiescomplete
Am to understand that you decline our offer
demanded Popham
Most decidedly
Then there is nothing more to be said
Come on gentlemen and Pophamstarted toward the door
moment more if you please requested the professor
Not another second
cried Popham
Our offer is withdrawn and ifyour socalled discoveries amount to anything we shall find other meansfor making them ineffective
had been interested in proceedings to an extent that had all butcaused me to forget my purpose
The plutocrats were about to leave thecastle in temper and if wrested tribute from them it must be now ornever
Starting up drew my revolver and ran hastily down the iron stairs
CHAPTER III
PROFESSOR QUINNS FEAT
My unexpected advent upon the scene proved as startling as hadanticipated
Even the professor was dashed
Stepping in front of the steel door toyed menacingly with therevolver and surveyed the plutocrats with grim humor made no attemptto conceal
At that period of my life inspired by the sophistry to which havealready adverted was cool and dangerous man
Pardon me for entering unannounced said blindly
You havelistened to Professor Quinns theory and witnessed its demonstration
Iam but an humble philosopher yet have theory of my own which Ishould also like to expound and to demonstrate
Who are you sir
demanded Quinn
am bird of like feather with these your guests said Ifacetiously albeit my methods are more direct if less extensive
Myname is James Peter Munn my specialty is robbery of the outandoutvariety for have the courage of my convictions and do not hidebehind technicality
do not wish to intrude my presence here longer than necessary toaccomplish my designs and if these amiable gentlemen will aid meIindicated the amiable gentlemen with my revolver pointI will take mydeparture quietly from the castle
Butand here scowledblacklysome trust or other will be minus its guiding power in case anyresistance is attempted
The threat was sufficient and the usual sunny smile returned to my faceas addedMr Gilhooly will advance to the table spread his handkerchief uponit and lay thereon his watch and fob the ring on his finger thekohinoor in his tie and the wallet in the breast of his coat
It is mytheory that one thief has the right to take from another property thatdoes not belong to either of them
It is Mr Gilhoolys privilege togive the first demonstration
Fidelity to truth forces me to chronicle the above speech
The éclatwith which made it is far from me now as pen it verbatim
There are speeches in life which we could wish unsaid and this one ofmine would give much to consign to the limbo of things unspoken
Reformation has worked wonders in me since that evil time
will say for Mr Gilhooly that he was alacrity itself in carrying outmy command
His hands trembled little as he placed his belongings onthe handkerchief and knotted the four corners over the plunder as Irequested
The professor smiling strangely sank down on the divan and watchedproceedings with twinkling eyes
His manner filled me with forebodingI tried not to manifest
Evidently this amuses you
cried Gilhooly in anger his snapping eyeson the professor
Your inference is correct Mr Gilhooly answered Quinn
amprofoundly amused
It is all so unexpected so dramatic andsouseless
By gad sir cried Popham see more in this than desire on yourpart to interest capital in fake discovery
There is plot heregentlemen and he turned to the other three
Our folly in allowingourselves to be lured to this place was stupendous
make no doubt butthat there is plot here between this man Quinn and this thief
Quinngets us in the thiefs power and the thief does the rest
pretty scheme
snapped Meigs
Clever very clever put in Markham
And successful too growled Gilhooly with regretful look at theplunder on the table
But there will be reckoning
When we are onceclear of this place we can set the police at work
was surprised at the way Quinn took this talk
He continued to smileand was in no way ruffled
Youre wrong there cried hot and indignant
Professor Quinn hadnothing to do with my being here
Ive had my eye on this castle for along while and let myself in just before you came hoping to make ahaul and get clear
You interrupted me and stowed myself awayupstairs
From what saw and heard must say that it is pleasurefor me to turn my back on Professor Quinns property and to give myentire attention to you four
Mr Munn said Quinn how long have you been engaged in thisbusiness
For some years now sir answered
You were honestonce
Every man is born honest if it comes to that
used to work in aniron foundry but the works were taken over by combination and lotof us were thrown out of employment
There was nothing for me to do butbegand Im above that
This came handiest and went into it
likethe business
Matching ones wits against the law keeps one constantlyin the midst of alarms so to speak and like excitement
And haveability for never yet have worn the stripes or learned the lockstep
have written some on the subject of my vocation in the hope ofbeguiling others into the work
dangerous man
muttered Gilhooly
What are we coming to
clamored Popham
Here is thief who isactually proud of his profession and who actually writes books aboutit
Merciful heavens
gasped Meigs in horror
feel sorry for mycountry when it produces such men
Wewe are tottering on the verge of chaos
added Markham in stagewhisper
laughed at all this for enjoyed it hugely
Spare yourselves any needless worry about me gentlemen said
Look to home and you will probably find enough there to fret yourconsciences
Professor Quinn continued to take pleasure out of the queer situation
can honor man like Munn said he where am tempted to despisemen like you Gilhooly Meigs Markham and Popham
As Munn said hehas the courage of his convictions
He does not take from the poor forin the very nature of things he cannot
His loot comes from those whoare able to lose it while you are vampires and sapping the verylifeblood of the nation
You are all criminally deluded althoughperhaps doing what you conscientiously believe to be exactly right
Would to Heaven and here the professor grew suddenly sincere andintensely earnest that something would conspire to open your eyes tothe exact truth
But have despaired of that and am trying in myown feeble way to meet the present emergency
You are either fool or madman
cried Popham
rattlebrained zealot
chimed in Meigs
You are the one who should see things differently said Markham
Youpreach doctrine which you fail to apply personally
Enough of this talk gentlemen interposed
My situation isprecarious and must ask you to hurry little
Sir shouted Popham leveling forefinger at me shall see youproperly jailed for this
Why you miserable footpad canSave your breath interrupted tartly meeting his forefinger withthe muzzle of the pepper box
Lead is no respecter of persons
One ofyou has called me dangerous man
am all of that and desperate
Mr Popham you saw how Mr Gilhooly carried out my orders
You willproceed in the same manner and without further loss of time
In fiveminutes must be out of here
He started to argue the point with me and allowed my forefinger toflex ever so slightly upon the trigger
That was enough
man values his life in direct ratio with what heconsiders his importance therefore the esteem in which these fourmillionaires held themselves must have been overwhelming
The Honorable Augustus Popham finally yielded up his personal propertywith the same readiness that had characterized his friend
HannibalMarkham followed him and after Markham came Archibald Meigs
had pleasant word for each as marshaled the four bundles strungthem on the fingers of my left hand and backed toward the door whichwas few paces behind me
When good general beats retreat said preparing to pull openthe door and let myself out he places as many obstacles in the path ofthe pursuing force as possible
When leave therefore shall lockthis door on the outside
was watched by the plutocrats in philosophical silence by theprofessor with geniality that nothing seemed able to shake
had spared Quinn because he was friend of the poor as haddiscovered
And had been poor myself some fifteen minutes back
Goodby said airily
Au revoir answered the professor
Look well where you step
threw open the door with laugh
The laugh faded into shout ofterror
threw out my hands revolver and packets of loot falling through thedoor and only barely saving myself with one foot over the threshold
The horror that gripped me then is such horror as comes to man butonce in lifetime
My brain sickened and chilled my heart all butstopped its beating and my limbs grew rigid
In the black of the fearsome nightnot the atmospheric blueblack hadbeen accustomed to but the ebony dark of ErebusI saw wild greenishstar below huge disk whose gleaming nimbus danced on my sight inquivering lines
Half crazed flung back into the room and fell groveling to the floormy ears echoing with the professors merriment and the startledexclamations of the four men had robbedall to no purpose
Presently sat up rubbing forehead and eyes
The professor stood in the open door gloating over the vista below
he called beckoning to the huddled quartet at the other side ofthe room
Come Gilhooly Meigs Popham and Markhamcome look downupon the scene of your feverish activities
You were plutocrats theremore powerful than kings
Here you are no more than shoulder high withme and yon muddled thief on the floor
You have been snatched from thescene of your pernicious laborsexiled into planetary space where youwill be powerless to work further evil
have not lived in vain forthis this is the triumph of my career
Slowly Meigs disentangled himself from the mute group by the oppositewall and crept on all fours to the threshold that overlooked the voidand the greenish star
He recoiled with yell then maddened by what he had seen he leapederect and tried to hurl himself out into space
cried the professor laying hold of him and struggling to keephim back
Would you become satellite of this twentybythirtyplanet
We are beyond the atmosphere of the earthlook
See the fourpackets of loot and the thiefs revolver
He pointed through the door and the bulging handkerchiefs and mysixshooter were abreast of us hanging in space turning slowlyweirdlya sight to upset the strongest mind
Gilhooly jumped forward gave vent to maniacal laugh then crumpleddown on the floor
Bid up for the GHD he mumbled bid to the limit
must havethat roadI will have it
Brace up Meigs
said the professor sharply pulling the key from theouter side of the lock slamming the door fastening it and putting thekey in his pocket
Take care of Gilhooly man
His mind falters
Heavens are you all mad
Are your keen minds unshaken in thecontemplation of vast deals for the enslavement of the poor so quick tobreak
had thought better of you than this
Meigs white as the spotless linen that covered his breast advancedupon the professor
He tried to speak but without success
At lastwith supreme effort the words cameMadman what have you done
That is better returned the professor smiling as he looked at Meigsand noted how Markham and Popham ranged themselves at his side muchbetter
You were engaged in plots back there on the earth and thesuccess of those plots would have proved great calamity
have savedthe world from the calamity
Youryour castle has risen from the earth
asked Meigs
It has fallen off the earth
As you and and the others happened tobe inside we fell with it
Sudden rage convulsed Meigs
He crouched downward his eyes ablaze andhis fingers working convulsively
he screamed and launched himself at the professors throatlike tiger
CHAPTER IV
THE PLUTOCRATS RECONCILED
Looking back now at that dreadful hour when the realization of our awfulpredicament burst upon us wonder that preserved my own equilibrium
The first shock came near to throwing me off my poise but after that Igained the whip hand of my wits by swift and sure degrees
verily believe the professor would have been strangled by Meigs aidedand abetted by Popham and Markham had not rushed to his rescue
Ihad muscles of iron and after had caught Meigs by the nape of theneck and thrown him backward planted myself between Quinn and hisfoes
Leave the professor alone said
You men show mighty poorjudgment it strikes me in trying to lay violent hands on him
He deserves death babbled Meigs
He had no business shooting usinto space in this summary manner
Fear and anger had made Meigs childish
He measured our dilemma interms so common smile came to my lips
Judgment poor judgment
sniffed Popham
Look at Gilhooly and thentalk about poor judgment if you can
In truth the railway magnate presented sorry spectacle
His clothingwas in wild disorder his hair was rumpled about his head and he washopping back and forth with two fingers in the air
He was under the impression that he was dealing in railroad stockscompleting the huge transaction that had made him the talk of twocontinents
This professor ought to be flayed alive declared Markham
Where arewe going and when will we get there
Now said
you are striking the keynote
Who knows where we aregoing if the professor doesnt
And who knows when we shall arrivethere if it is out of his power to tell
We need the professor for ifwe are to be saved it will be his knowledge that does it
But what will my family think
whimpered Meigs
And my businessinterests
He threw up his hands and fell back in his seat with groan
Thenabruptly he straightened up again
This is dream
By gad it must be
The whole affair is toooutrageously unreal for any sane man to believe
Gilhooly gave maudlin chuckle
was dead sure Id get that last block of XYZ
That road isthe last span in my network of ties and rails
Now well see
NowMeigs shivered
Gilhoolys maunderings struck sharply at his desire tocoddle himself with myth
Its awful to have Gilhooly like that spoke up Augustus Popham
Ifhe had not been thrown out of balance his wide knowledge of mattersrelating to transportation might have proved of inestimable service tous now
Professor Quinn laughed
It was an eerie laugh and it shook me to hearit
Oh you
cried Markham reproachfully whirling on Quinn
Aftercausing this disaster and overthrowing as brilliant mind as there everwas in Wall Street you have the heart to indulge in levity
Look herehow far are we from the earth at the present moment
That is difficult matter to estimate even approximately answeredQuinn calmly
Ordinarily gravity exerts force that can be measureddefinitely on the earths surface
body falling freely from restacquires velocity which is equal to the product of thirtytwo andonefifth feet and the number of seconds during which the motion haslasted
What is the time now
Three gentlemen reached for their watches failed to find them andturned hard looks on me
appreciated their dilemma and drew from myvest an openface timepiece that was personal property and honestly comeby
It is twelvefifteen said IQuinn took pencil and notebook from his pocket and did some figuring
We might be little more than two miles from our native planet saidhe butOnly two miles
cried the three exiles in chorus
You can take us back sir said Popham who had been pacing the floornervously
Shut off the power of this infernal machine and let us dropback to where we belong
Two miles is no great matter
Your castle isa slow freight compared with some of Gilhoolys express trains
cannot take you back sir returned the professor and would notif could
You did not hear me out
The law of velocity recited foryour benefit moment ago does not measure the speed of this car
murmured Markham
Decidedly not
The earth sweeps along in its orbit at the rate ofeighteen miles to the second while some aerolites and meteoroids attaina speed of twenty and thirty miles to the second
In building this carI equipped it with an antigravity block geared up to fifty miles to thesecond
The lever on the walland here Quinn turned and pointed toitis thrown so as to give us the maximum
In other words said Popham feebly we are sailing skyward at rateofof three thousand miles perper minute
As we left my city lot in New York at aboutelevenfifteen it follows that we have been one hour on the way
And should be one hundred and eighty thousand miles from homefaltered Meigs
About that answered the professor calmly
do not know just howmuch our progress was impeded by the atmospheric envelope of the earthbut think we may call our distance from the mother orb some onehundred and eighty thousand miles in round numbers
These startling figures came near to unsettling the three gentlemenagain
In that flight through space we were confronting immensitieswellnigh beyond our puny comprehension
And the professor was not yetdone
In the storeroom overhead he continued have supply of cubes andinsulating compound which can combine and give tremendous addedvelocity to the car
am sure we are traveling fast enough said Meigs leaning back onthe divan hopelessly dejected
If you are now ready to listen to reason proceeded Quinn
willtell you how Mr Munn here saved your lives by rescuing me from your madattack
Our lives forsooth
exclaimed Markham bitterly
Of what value islife to us situated as we are
That is one way to look at it of course rejoined Quinn caustically
But did not exile you into planetary space for the purpose of wipingyou out of existence
You might as well have done so said Popham severely
That is whatthis harumscarum plot of yours amounts to in the long run
You may not care to learn how am preserving you at the presentmoment continued Quinn nor how shall do so in the future yet Iwill tell you so that you may understand how much you owe to Mr Munnsforesight and courage
was beginning to entertain high regard for Quinn in spite of what hehad done
He may have been laboring under terrible delusions but hisresource certainly commanded respect
To my forethought he continued is due the fact that you arebreathing oxygen at this moment and had not invented liquid whichfortifies animate or inanimate bodies against heat and cold our rushthrough the atmosphere of the earth would have incinerated this car andits contentsnay would have caused it to explode and settle back on ournative planet in impalpable powder
These were things that none of us aside from the professor had so muchas taken thought of
My respect for him was growing into something likeawe and fancied detected traces of the same sentiment in the otherthree
There are roving bodies in space Quinn went on noting with apparentsatisfaction the interest he had aroused with which we might come intocollision
have good telescope at the observatory window upstairsand while cannot guide this car can at least increase or slackenits speed so as to dodge any other derelict that may come into dangerousproximity with us
Hadnt you better be up there on the lookout
queried Markham in sometrepidation
He was manifesting an interest in his personal safety that pleased theprofessor
There is not much danger at present returned Quinn
When we haveplunged farther into the interstellar void it will be well to standwatch and watch about at the telescope
Will it not be possible to land on some other planet Mars forinstance
queried Popham with sudden hope
should prefer Mars added Meigs reflecting the hope shown in hisfriends face
They have been signaling from Mars and perhaps we canfind out what they want over there
Quinn shook his head
We are in the hands of fate gentlemen said he
We may drop intosome port but what that port will be is beyond my power even tosurmise
The moon isnt so far off suggested Markham
Only two hundred and forty thousand miles said Quinn
We should be there in less than two hours from the time of startingremarked Meigs after mental bout with the figures
If wished said Quinn could increase our speed traveling at therate we are however something will have to be deducted for theresistance of the earths atmosphere
If we drop on planet it must bea planet with an atmosphere
The moon has none and consequently is adead world
Besides fate might not throw us into its vicinity orJust minute sir interposed Markham for am man who likes tounderstand thoroughly every situation with which he is called upon todeal
You invited us to your castle not am constrained to believeto have us victimized by Munn here nor to have us invest in any ofyour discoveries but to snatch us away from the scene of our labors
Is that correct Professor Quinn
Entirely so Mr Markham replied Quinn
Evidently proceeded Markham your plot has cost you some time andlabor
You had first to find your gravityresisting compoundThe plot followed as result of my discovery smiled the professor
did not first evolve the plot and then go searching for means to getyou off the earth
When had made the discovery it remained for me togive it to the worldor to better the world by taking you four gentlemenaway from it
Had given the public the benefit you shrewd men ofaffairs might have devised means for setting it aside or forcontrolling it
Not being business man myself feared to takechances
For that reason the present enterprise appealed to me
You have planned so well in the smaller details that wonder youoverlooked the main point
And that isWhat you are going to do with us now that your plan has succeeded
The professor tossed his hands deprecatingly as though that was reallythe most insignificant part of his startling scheme
We cant go bobbing around through interstellar space grumbledPopham
dont relish the idea of being cribbed cabined and confinedin steel room indefinitely
should go mad from the very thought
Its awful to contemplate said Meigs casting melancholy glancethrough the iron latticework at one of the windows
The bags of loot were in that vicinity at the moment and his glanceswerved reproachfully to me
We shall make landing have no doubt said the professorsoothingly somehow and somewhere
By gad sir cried Popham bringing his fist emphatically down on thetable dont like such hitandmiss way of doing things
WheneverI set out to accomplish anything the goal is always clear in my mindyet here am through no desire of my own afloat in the great voidwithout single aim or remote prospect
If we are going to landanywhereand you remain firm in your decision not to take us back to ournative planetI demand that you make landfall on some orb that is worthwhile
Very good Popham approved Meigs
Unless am greatly mistaken thatwas the very idea Markham had in mind when he began questioning theprofessor
Eh Markham
It was replied Markham
full knowledge of where we are going isnecessary to thorough understanding of ourermost remarkablesituation
Now there are worlds larger than the one we have recentlyleft
Personally am predisposed in favor of large planetone onwhich there are traction interests fuel supplies and products of thesoil similar to those we have been accustomed to
Under the spell of Markhams words Popham began to glow and expand
Meigs all attention pressed little closer
The bigger the planet the bigger our field of operations
Whats the matter with Jupiter
Or Saturn
echoed Meigs
Or Neptune
put in Markham
Whats the matter with the whole solar system
inquired Quinn withgentle irony
He turned to me
Observe Mr Munn how extravagant arethe ideas inspired by monopoly
These gentlemen are hardly started ontheir journey into space before they forget the business interests thefriends and the environment they are leaving behind and begin planningthe commercial conquest of the stars
He shook his head forebodingly
Your regeneration he added to the millionaires calls for landingon some barren world some outcast of the solar system where you willhave nothing to do but think over the evil of your past and learnsomething of the duty you owe your fellowmen
Popham Markham and Meigs were visibly annoyed by the professorsremarks
Withdrawing as far as the limits of the steel structure wouldallow they put their heads together and held brief but animatedconversation in tones so low that the professor and could notoverhear
Think of that professor
And yet there are people whofind fault with respectable burglar
Softly Mr Munn returned Quinn
Before we are done with thisjourney am fain to believe that all of you will have differentoutlook upon life and higher regard for your duties of citizenship
Just then Popham turned from his friends and stepped toward theprofessor
His manner was truculentprobably just such manner as hewas accustomed to use in facing board of obstinate directors
If you will not return us to our native planet Professor Quinn saidhe sharply then we shall stand upon our rights
We are unalterablyopposed to landing upon any orb whose diameter measures less thanAt that instant most astounding thing happened
The car duckedsideways throwing the whole structure out of plumb
Loose articles began to drop from shelves and other places and to slideacross the floor to the lowest point
By quick movement saved thelamp and braced myself in an upright position
Cries of terror went up from Markham Meigs and Popham
Wheres Gilhooly
shouted the professor
He was answered by wild yell from overhead
Hes in the storeroom
cried Quinn
Follow me with that lampMunnquick
The professor rushed for the stairway and made after him with whatspeed could
CHAPTER TRAVELING SUNWARD
There never lived man suppose who did not at some time or otherin his career submit his veracity to question
reformed burglartherefore although animated by the most disinterested motives canscarcely hope to escape the shafts of the incredulous
Although wellgrounded in the science of cracksmanship and with somestore of legal learning as to alibis and so forth my mind was as emptyof astronomical lore as drained bottle
The professors sayings werejotted down in sort of commonplace book at later day when leisureoffered
Memory may have played me false in some few minor points but in all ofmajor importance this narrative is to be taken with the same sincerityin which it is written
ask no more of the reader than that and ifhe is not averse to strolling through unfrequented ways touching elbowswith man who has past we shall get along famously
To return then to the steel car and the obliquity it suddenlypresented to the direction of its course
Startling disclosures hadsomewhat obscured Gilhooly and he had vanished from the lower roomwithout being missed
For man of sixtyfive the professor was very agile and he took thewinding iron stairway two steps at time
gained the storeroom closebehind him and there we found Gilhooly crooning to himself and workinglike mad
He was not working in the dark but had possessed himself of mybullseye lantern which had left on descending from the loft sometime before
Mounted on pile of packing cases he was engaged inpainting large steel cube taking his pigment from an open cask with awhitewash brush
My antigravity compound
exclaimed the professor in an irritatedtone
There are several blocks on the floor as you can see Gilhoolybegan painting that one and it rose as insulation proceeded lodging tothe left of the dome and tilted the car
This is the shabbiest lot of coaches ever saw in my life saidGilhooly dabbing away with the brush
wont own road with suchrolling stock
The three men downstairs had followed Quinn and me
After some coaxingMeigs got Gilhooly to descend from his perch and give up the whitewashbrush
Thereupon the cube was pried over until it rested directly under anotherblock in the point of the dome and the professor finished theinsulation begun by the railway magnate
Gilhooly will have to be watched said Quinn or he will play havocwith the materials have stored up here
He has wasted at least aquart of that antigravity mixture and it is worth its weight in gold
Nay it is worth more than that for after this supply is exhaustedthere will be none to be had for love or money
Our rate of speed has been multiplied by two and we are rushingthrough space with frightful rapidity
There is my telescopeand theprofessor pointed to the instrument which stood beneath window in thesloping roof of the car
Suppose Gilhooly had demolished that
Or whatif he had wrecked the oxygen vat or the antitemperature reservoir
Gentlemen shudder to think of what might have happened
The professor sank down on copper tank and brushed his perspiring browwith bandanna handkerchief
placed the lamp on box beside thebullseye lantern and reclined on bale of something or other that layconveniently near
Meigs and Popham dropped down on packing case with Gilhooly mooredbetween them and Markham took up his station on an overturned cask
The loft of the car stored as it was with odds and ends of sciencetogether with supply of provisions made ready for us by the farsightedand wonderful man who was conducting this select party into the unknownwas an object of deep solicitude and interest
Out of desire to tag the various materials understandingly liftedthe lid of my curiosity and let out few questions
If mistake not said you mentioned this antitemperaturematerial once before
What is it professor
liquid he answered amiably
As discovery it is outranked onlyby my antigravity compound
An ounce of the fluid in bath rendersthe bather impervious to heat or cold keeping in the animal caloric andkeeping out all other extremes of temperature
Some of the mixture wasincorporated into the paint with which this car is coated
Yonder is the water receptacle and the professor nodded toward alarge tank opposite him
With economy the supply in that reservoirwill last us several months
The food have provided is of thereadyprepared kind mostly in tins with an alcohol lamp for thebrewing of tea coffee and chocolate
During this hegira into infinityI have omitted nothing gentlemen which will minister to your comfort
You are very able man professor acknowledged Popham
How longhave you been planning this little excursion
Ever since began erecting what the Harlemites were pleased to call mycastle smiled Quinn
The plan was conceived at the time the successof the manipulations of yourself and your friends seemed assured
It was your purpose to foil the speculative gentlemen struck inand so come to the aid of longsuffering public
You hit off the matter finely Mr Munn replied the professor
Thatwas my purpose
Could not your antitemperature mixture have been donated to the poorwith beneficial results
It is altogether too expensive for general use
will not conceal fromyou gentlemen the fact that we are falling sunward
If we make landfallon planet where the heat is several hundred degrees beyond our earthlypowers of endurance the mixture in question will preserve us
Falling sunward
exclaimed Markham
It was hard upon midnight whenwe left the earth
If my schoolday learning is not at fault the sunat the hour of our departure was on the opposite side of our planet
How then does it happen that we are falling toward the greatluminary
cried the professor vastly pleased
am glad to see MrMarkham that your intellect has not suffered total eclipse by thedemands of commercial supremacy
Night is the result of one of theEarths hemispheres being turned from the sun and other things beingequal we should now be falling toward the outer limits of our solarsystem but if may use the term the castle was not aimed for adirect fall from the earths crust
We dropped at very sharp angleand the influence of the sun has attracted us still farther out of astraight course
trust you follow me
The three millionaires understood the situation but judging from theexpression of their faces the knowledge brought keen disappointment
There are only two planets between the earth and the sun observedMarkham Mercury and Venus if remember rightly
Both insignificant grumbled Popham
Venus is about the size of our own planet gentlemen said theprofessor
However it has long been supposed that there is anothergroup of planets between Mercury and the sun among them little worldcalled Vulcan whichThat does not interest us cut in Meigs
Sunward the planets aresmaller but they get larger as you go the other way
Larger expounded the professor but less dense
As was about to tell you moment ago pursued Popham MeigsMarkham and have decided that either Saturn or Mars would about fillthe bill so far as we are concerned
There are lights on Mars whichas we figure it presupposes electricity and electricity meanscivilization to degree that affords us promising prospect
Thenagain there are canals on Mars and if canals certainly watertransportation
Transportation problems of any sort will interestGilhooly indeed we are prone to think they would bring him back to hisnormal poise
Saturn on the other hand has rings and such conditionmight afford opportunities to wideawake men such as are unknownanywhere else in the solar system
Take us either to Mars or to SaturnProfessor Quinn as you may find it most convenient
We demand it
It is impossible to do anything of that kind Mr Popham returned theprofessor decidedly
The influence of the sun upon our course is toopowerful
Are we to understand then cried Markham that we are compelled toput up with either Mercury or Venus
Even there gentlemen we have no choice
We are in the grip ofcircumstances and must perforce accept whatever fate throws our way
Possibly we shall become satellite of the sun revolving around andaround itQuinns Planet the smallest of any in the great system
Although felt drowsy aroused myself with an effort and kept sharpeyes on the professors face
do not think he was in earnest butmerely talking to see what effect his remarks would have on the threemillionaires
Corner corner corner babbled Gilhooly make corner cornereverything
Markham dropped his face in his hands Meigs bowed his head and saw ashiver run through Popham
Egad muttered Popham this castle of yours Quinn is little shortof steel tomb
Inasmuch as we are safely interred whats the use ofliving
Gilhooly is the only fortunate one among us for his reason isshattered and he cannot realize what he is facing
You are talking less like man now Popham reproved Quinn thanlike driveling idiot
While theres life theres hope
How manybrilliant minds have been overthrown as result of your manipulationsof stock in Wall Street
How many bright futures have been wrecked byan adverse trend of the speculative market
Were those unfortunates anybetter off because thrust into madhouses and unable to realize the fatethat had overtaken them
For shame sir
You are perfectly sure are you professor struck in attempting togive more pleasant twist to the conversation that we shall come outall right in the end
have my plans Mr Munn he answered not unkindly and the successor failure of them will depend largely upon the mental attitude of thesegentlemen
This was too deep for me and cast about for some equally importantquestion which would bring less indefinite response
Anyhow said we have plenty of food for long journey
It wouldbe fearful thing to have famine soso many miles from base ofsupplies
The food supply Mr Munn answered the professor is adequate
There will be no famine
And the water the oxygen theI have looked after everything necessary to our safety and comfort
had confidence in Quinn
He had shown that he was an able man andthat his promises were to be taken at face value
With sigh ofrelief settled back in tolerable comfort
Meigs took the role of questioner out of my hands at this point andalthough was eager to hear all that was said tired natures sweetrestorer got the better of my curiosity and fell asleep on the bale
CHAPTER VI
LANDING EFFECTED
It is not my purpose to cumber this narrative with the smaller detailsof our journey novel and thrilling though some of them proved to be
It is with our experiences on the planet which finally claimed us thatthis account has mostly to do so shall glide over intermediateincidents in somewhat cursory manner
Our faculties keyed to an understanding of earthly conditions onlyfound themselves continually at bay and at nothing did they stand moreaghast than at the lightninglike speed with which we shot throughspace
The energy developed by the two insulated cubes gave to our steel carthe stupendous velocity of one hundred miles per second six thousandmiles per minute three hundred and sixty thousand miles per hour
Human reason might well falter at the threshold of such immensity
Yet while slept peacefully on that bale in the storeroom thesefigures were verified by the professor and Archibald Meigs whohappened to be the only two who were wide awake
It has been my lastingregret that they did not rouse me so that might also have had viewof the noble spectacle for the first time unrolled to earthly eyes
We passed the moon dreary burnedout world and the professor wasable to check off two hundred and forty thousand miles of our sunwardplunge
We had traveled little more than half an hour at our ultimatevelocity taking this into consideration and noting the exact minutewhen we crossed the centre of the satellites orbit the professor wasable to do some figuring and so test his theories as to speed
The car skimmed through ether less than five hundred miles above thelunar crust
Quinn was doubly pleased for he not only proved that ourvelocity was substantially as he had supposed but also discovered thatthe moons attraction so powerful on the tides of our mother spherecould not swerve the car by hairs breadth from its direct course orovercome the influence of the sun
Meigs told me later that the marvelous beauty of the satellite gleamingagainst the black void with ghostly radiance was probably worth thetrip and its attendant inconveniences
He and Quinn had looked theirfill on the hemisphere which is never seen from the earth
After this the hours literally flew past the novelty of our journeyprecluding any such thing as monotony
In fact we hardly allowedourselves sufficient amount of time for rest and refreshment
lookout was kept continually at the eyepiece of the telescope tosignal the approach of any asteroid with which we might possibly comeinto collision
Only once did this danger threaten us and then as maybe supposed it was the professor who proved our salvation
The lever in the wall of the lower or living room of the carcommunicated with screens ingeniously arranged for shutting off thepower of the antigravity cubes
By lessening our speed the professorsuffered the asteroid to cross our course our car ducking through theluminous trail that swept out behind it
Night reigned around us constantly
Our car caught the rays of the sunit is true but the lack of an atmosphere caused the light to be thrownback into space and lost
The castle was nothing less than small planet attended by fivesatellites which held to our vicinity by the cars attraction circledaround us continually
These satellites were the four knottedhandkerchiefs containing the tribute had levied upon the plutocratsand also the revolver which had assisted me in the work
These objects went through varied phases exactly as more pretentioussatellites would have done
It would be difficult to describe myfeelings as watched them from the car windows
am prone to think at the present writing that this lost bootywaxing and waning under my eyes planted in my nature those first seedsof regret which finally grew into reformation
recall conversation that had with Markham while sat with my eyeat the lower end of the telescope watching for stray asteroids
The millionaires had given me to understand that was not in their set
Circumstances over which they had no control had brought us togetherwithin the narrow confines of the car but no social barriers had beenleveled
Occasionally the novelty of our situation and the consequentexcitement would cause one or other of the wealthy gentleman to forgetthe gulf that yawned between us
This attitude of the magnate afforded me good deal of innocentenjoyment
They had left social prestige no less than their bankaccounts behind them and what little collateral they had had upontheir persons was now satelliting about the car
The line they drewbetween themselves and me in their thoughtful moments was adistinction without much of difference
Markham remember was munching sandwich contrived out of twocrackers and slice of tinned beef
Did you never reflect Mr Munn said he upon the evil of yourpast
When man writes books which are mainly drawn from his own experienceMr Markham said he has to go into his past pretty exhaustively
Ah yes was forgetting about the books
Were you not horrified withthe results of your retrospection
Well yes here and there
lost big haul once throughthe breaking of jimmy and was horrified to think how any dealer inburglars kits could have foisted such an unreliable instrument upon awellmeaning cracksman
Markham stared at me dazedly
have set down the experience in Chapter One of Forty Ways forCracking Safes proceeded and one of the first of my ten rules forsuccess in any safecracking job was this Be sure that your kit isreliable and without flaws
Mr Munn Mr
whispered Markham hoarsely
Think of the peoplefrom whom you have taken property dishonestly
never think of them but to wish that had been able to relieve themof more
This is awful
muttered Markham
You really exult over what you havedone
He would have started down the iron stairs had not restrained him witha word
Let me ask you something Mr Markham said
Last fall bread wentto ten cents loaf because the wheat market was corneredand man bythe name of Markham did the cornering
The people who had to put up thatextra five cents missed it more than did those from whom took fivehundred dollars
Markham coughed
Any asteroids in sight
he inquired absently
wonder if you ever did any reflecting
asked tartly
What do you think of Quinn
and Markham looked away as took my eyefrom the telescope and gave him an expressive wink
dont think continued that you ever wrote book called FortyWays to Starve the Poor You have material enough for prettyeffective volume on the subject but you havent my nerve
No he returned slowly havent your nerve
It requires unalloyedimpudence and mind incapable of clear thinking to liken the results ofhigh finance with those of your own petty and highly criminalproceedings
You are too bright man Mr Munn to allow yourself tobe led afield by sophistries of that kind
Mr Markham Mr
breathed in horrified protest
You have bolstered up your nefarious business with false ideals hewent on and you are unregenerate and lost
This is awful
When we get to where we are going pursued Markham either failing tonote my sarcasm or else hoping to ride it down trust you will holdyour criminal instincts in check
If there are any people there dontgive them any false ideals or implant the notion that your standardsbelong to the rest of us
would not so belittle my ideals returned bluntly
Sir he cried sharply am to understand that you set yourself up asbeing any better than Mr Popham Mr Gilhooly Mr Meigs or myself
What you understand doesnt concern me in the least answeredairily
What you dont understand it strikes me is the matter thatought to claim your attention
Confound you sir
Your overwhelming ignorance is equalled only byyour colossal egotism
am sorry that allowed myself to be beguiledinto any talk with you
Our regrets are mutual said for your conversation isdemoralizing
You are past master in successful trickerytrickery ofthe sort that ought to be stamped out
If the law was as quick to dealwith you as with meHold
fumed Markham plunging for the stairs have heard enough
have said that was hard man in those times
could call spadea spade with never thought that my angle of vision was distorted
Ihave regretted expressing my views in this frank fashion to Markham yetI believe that there was injustice in his remarks no less than in mine
Being the only person in the car who possessed watch the professorappointed me official timekeeper
It was my duty to bulletin the hourwith its equivalent in days such as we were accustomed to upon ablackboard in the lower room had also to enter this information upona book which the professor called the logbook
Every ten hours we had class in astronomy with the professor asinstructor and with every man save Gilhooly and the lookout as students
The railway magnates aberration continued all we could do was to watchhim solicitously and prevent him from doing any injury to himself or toour paraphernalia
The class learned that the nearest planet with an atmosphere andsupposedly habitable was Venus which at inferior conjunction isdistant some twentyfive million miles from Terra as Quinn called ourown planet
Counting out the delays at starting and in maneuvring toescape the asteroid our instructor asserted that we should reach Venusin something like seventyfive hours
Markham Meigs and Popham on consulting the bulletin board and findingthat seventy hours had passed began to brush their clothes and tidythemselves against the hour of landing
But they were destined todisappointment
Unable to locate Venus at the point where he had hoped to find it theprofessor decided that it was nearing superior conjunction and wassomewhere on the other side of the sun
Meigs made deplorable displayof temper
Quinn was mighty poor astronomer he said sneeringly if he could findhimself so far wide of the mark on such simple matter
Meigs furtheraddedwith good deal of childishness as thoughtthat the role of aderelict was distasteful to him derelict he argued was nothing morethan tramp and he objected to being tramp even celestial tramp
was out of patience with the man
Admiration for the professor hadtaken fast hold of me and would not have him sneered at or maligned
war of hot words was on between myself and the Wall Street broker whenQuinn interfered
True said he we have missed Venus by few millions of miles butwe are aimed directly at the orbit of another world and can somanipulate the lever as to wait for it if necessary and drop upon itssurface when it overtakes us
What world is that
said Popham pricking tip his ears
Mercury answered the professor
It is the smallest orb in our solarsystem and measures some three thousand miles in diameter
thought Venus was rather contracted for men with such large schemesas ourselves remarked Meigs shaking his head but this other planetseems to be smaller still
wonder if they have coal mines there
murmured Popham meditatively
And if they grow wheat and cotton
added Meigs
If Mercury is inhabited spoke up Markham eagerly food willcertainly be as necessary there as on the earth
dont knowgentlemen but it strikes me we might fall into worse places
Poor Gilhooly
sighed Meigs
What pity it will be if theMercurials prove to have traction interests
How long before we shall reach this planet you speak of professor
inquired Popham
Well answered Quinn thoughtfully Mercury is rather slow
Ittravels along its orbit at the rate of thirty miles per second while weare moving at one hundred miles
At rough estimate should say wecan effect juncture with the planet in ten hours although an extrahour may be required for maneuvres to secure landing
The ten hours that followed were hours of great anxiety and feverishlabor
Believing that my nerves were the steadiest the professorplaced me at the telescope to act as pilot while he served as engineerand manipulated the lever
The responsibilities of my position so worked upon me that had no timefor the glories of the planet we were endeavoring to intercept
Throughthe telescope saw huge mountains and broad plains but they wereblurred over with reddish light and the lesser details of topographywere lost
When five hours were gone the professor left the lever and cameupstairs to have look through the telescope for himself
You have done very well indeed Mr Munn he was pleased to say butI think that had better take this post from now on while you go belowand station yourself at the switch board
The slightest mismanagementwhen the critical moment arrives might hurl us against Mercury with aforce that would result in annihilation
The lever turns in half circle as you may know
The arc is dividedinto spaces numbered from zero to ninety
will call down to you thenumber to which you must throw the lever you will repeat the numberback to me and instantly obey my order
Trust me sir said
But the professor was loath to let me go without still furtherimpressing upon me the importance of the work before us
In order to alight safely Mr Munn he continued we must graduatethe power of the antigravity cubes to the Mercurial atmosphere
Byproceeding intelligently in the matter we shall make the car weighslightly more than the atmosphere we encounter then when we are aboutto land we will let the car just counterbalance the pull of theplanet and there will not be the slightest jar
understand professor answered and went downstairs
Markham Meigs and Popham ascended to the upper chamber this positionbringing them few feet nearer the goal of our desires as well asgiving them point of vantage from which to watch events
Gilhooly wasthe only one besides myself in the lower room he was kneeling on thedivan writing imaginary stock quotations on the steel wall with thepoint of his finger
For four hours or more the professor called out for slight variations inthe speed of the car but in the main the lever was held on the number which gave maximum velocity
The tension of the minutes usheringin the last hour of the ten is beyond my power to describe
Once in my evil days manipulated the tumblers of combination andpulled open vault door
Behind the door stood two men with revolvers
For two seconds stared agape at the trap which had sprung uponmyself and when got away had bullet in my shoulder
Intensify my feelings fourfold as stood looking into the leveledrevolvers of those two men then spread out the two seconds to cover ahalf hour
In this way only can describe my state of mind while wefought for safe landing on the planet Mercury
Cries of wonder and apprehension echoed to me from overhead
Above themI heard the shrill voice of the professorZero
Zero repeated throwing the lever clear over
There followed jolt as the screens covered the cubes and shut offtheir energy
Instantly there came the sickening sensation of fallaccompanied by rush of displaced air that roared and bellowed allabout the car
shrieked Quinn
yelled throwing the lever half over
Then we caught ourselves with suddenness that threw me to my knees
We were moving upward againI could feel the steel floor rising underme
came down from above
Twenty answered hoarsely struggling erect and shifting the lever
felt that we were still rising but slowly
The professor wasjuggling with an unknown atmosphere and on the success of his judgmentdepended our lives
and over went the lever for five degrees
We were swinging stationary in midair
From the window by the switchboard looked outward and downward with bulging eyes
dazzling glow covered peak and plain and turned away that my sightmight not be blinded to the lever numbers
cried the professor
Ten it is
and threw the switch to the number given
Then again we dropped but slowly very slowly
repeated the order and again the air rushed against the blunt base ofthe car yet not so fiercely as before
Then all of sudden felt agrip of fingers about my throat and was hauled from the lever andthrown back on the floor
Gilhooly had knee on my breast and was strangling me with fingers ofsteel
The fire of an insane purpose gleamed in his eyes and he seemedpossessed of the strength of dozen demons
struggled but might as well have tried to rise under thethousandtons pressure of hydraulic press
cried Quinn
did not answerI could not for my tongue was lolling between my lips
screamed Quinn
Tenor were lostA groan hardly audible escaped my gasping throat
heard franticclamor above and then there was such jar and crash as hope shallnever experience again
All tangible life slipped away from me and collapsed into anunconsciousness that felt might be death itself
CHAPTER VII
FACING MERCURIAL STORM
That our lives were preserved and the car saved from destruction was dueto two circumstances one of them most peculiar and of farreachingimportance
The lesser of the two circumstances was this the car had not dropped tothe plain but had had its downward rush intercepted by an elevation sothat the force of our fall was just about half what might have beenexpected
As to the other and more vital circumstance the fall itself was notwhat it would have been on our own sphere
The pull of gravity onMercury as we afterward discovered has only onethird the power it hason Terra
To this phenomenon were due many wonderful things as thereader will discover before we have gone very far
was not the first of our party to open his eyes after the landing forwhen sat up and stared about me saw the professor moving around thesteel chamber and ministering to the others
Gilhooly was creeping toward the divan on all fours muttering somethingabout great slump in the market and chuckling over the way in whichhe had got out from under
Archibald Meigs was groaning and trying to lift himself on his elbowAugustus Popham was on his knees wobbling erratically and apparentlyundecided whether to say his prayers or to try and get up HannibalMarkham was flattened out along the floor the professor kneeling overhim and chafing his temples
What sort of navigator are you Quinn
asked Meigs crossly
Bygad it is more dangerous to make port with you than it is to sailthrough space
Dont blame the professor for fault of mine Meigs spoke upwarmly
The broker looked at me with something like contempt
blame him for placing an incompetent and irresponsible person at suchan important post as the switch board said Meigs
He should haveknown that man who holds your distorted views on the subject ofpersonal property is not to be trusted
Thats right added Popham lifting himself to the divan
Gilhooly made an attack on me said
He bore me down and camewithin one of strangling me
Quinn is the cause of Gilhoolys abnormal condition persisted Meigswho was bound to have Quinn at fault for every evil that overtook us
got up rather more wrathful than the situation demanded
The fallhad jarred my temper no less than my body and was in mood to havethe business out with Meigs at close quarters
Softly Mr
cautioned the professor
It is well to have deafear for these gentlemen at times
Help me lift Mr Markham to thedivan
The professors words dispelled my anger
Without another word to MeigsI went over and assisted in getting the food trust magnate into morecomfortable position
Markham was not long in recovering and when we took stock of ourselveswe found that we were not much the worse for our shaking up
Quinncalled to me to go upstairs with him and see if any havoc had beenwrought there
We found that no particular damage had been done to the instruments orother material
When we descended to the lower chamber after anabsence of fifteen or twenty minutes Meigs had the key in the steeldoor and was standing at the entrance with Popham and Markham on eitherside of him
Where did you get that key
demanded the professor one hand gropingin his pocket
Heretofore he had been careful to keep the key upon his person
Smallwonder that he was now surprised to find it in the possession of Meigs
found it on the floor replied the broker with good deal ofdignity
Probably you lost it out of your pocket when you fell fromthe stairs few minutes ago
What are you intending to do
asked the professor quietly
Professor Quinn sir returned Meigs with elaborate condescension wehave reached the parting of the ways
While we were traveling throughspace and my friends could do nothing less than bear with yourcompany and with that of the rogue at your side but now that we aresafely moored on Mercury and can debark we see fit to withdrawourselves and renounce further intercourse with you
murmured Quinn slow smile hovering about his thin lips
The smile caused some acerbity to manifest itself in the three gentlemenat the door
They drew themselves up haughtily
Quinn went on the broker sharply you lured us into your castle andabducted us from our native orb with small regard for the feelings ofour relatives or friends and no consideration whatever for the businessinterests with which we were engaged soYour business interests had my every consideration interrupted theprofessor
Meigs took no notice of the remark
So he continued remembering these wrongs we feel that we can nolonger associate with you
As for Munnhere he turned fastidious eyein my directionhe is utterly impossible to men of our social standing
This planet you tell us is three thousand miles in diameter
May werequest that you and Munn take one end of the diameter and leave theother end to us
The professor laughed softly and seated himself
Sit down Mr Munn said he
We have been ostracized by ourfellowexiles
Let us see how well they get along without us
We bid you farewell finished Meigs loftily
Thereupon he turned the key threw open the doorand dropped on thethreshold as though he had been shot
Markham and Popham cried aloudthrew their arms across their faces and reeled back
blast as from furnace drove in at the opening filling the chamberlike draft from Hades
could scarcely breathe in the stiflingatmosphere
Hurry Munn
cried Quinn
Drag Meigs away from the door or hell beburned to crisp
The broker was already smoking when caught his ankles and jerked himinside
The professor slammed the door
Presently the air within the car readjusted itself to normal conditions
Meigs red as beet and breathing heavily was little the worse for hiswarm experience
fancy Mr Meigs cooed the professor that you will wish to availyourself of one of my antitemperature baths before cutting loose frommyself and Mr Munn
There is plenty of water left for all of us and Iwill go aloft set up the collapsible tub and make the bath ready
Wehave alighted in the tropics evidently and at the period ofmidsummer
The temperature is about five hundred degrees fahrenheit
With that the professor took the key from the door to keep Gilhooly frommaking dash outside and started for the storeroom
followed himthe three disgruntled gentlemen gazing after us mutely
The professor and were the first to fortify ourselves with theantitemperature bath
After dipping our bodies we rinsed our clothingin the liquid
Aside from pleasant cooling sensation the bath gave no evidence ofits potent qualities
There was no hardening of the skin as fanciedthere might be no change in its ruddy color no inconvenience
When we went down again we sent the other three gentlemen aloft theprofessor instructing them as to the necessity of making their clothingas well as their bodies proof against the climate
In due coursePopham Meigs and Markham once more showed themselves
Gilhooly of course had also to be made immune and he struggledagainst it so fiercely that we were obliged to hold him in the tub whilethe professor poured three buckets of the mixture over him
He was not disrobed and when sufficiently drenched he leaped from thetub and fled raving to the lower chamber
Now said the professor we are prepared to fare forth
Yougentlemenhe addressed himself to Markham Meigs and Pophammay gowith Mr Munn and me or keep by yourselves as you may elect
But itwill be well to make this car our headquarters
Here we have food anddrink also stronghold in case of attack by the Mercurialsif therehappen to be any
How can there be any life in such an overheated atmosphere
Nature is great leveler of barriers replied Quinn
She is able toadjust life to its environment you may be sure just as easily as shecan bridge the social chasm that separates thief from trustmagnate
His eyes twinkled
Such bridge he added would not prove much of tax on herresources
For my own part do not think the chasm either so wide orso deep as you gentlemen appear to imagine
chuckled at that and Meigs and his two companions grew dulyresentful
As for Mr Gilhooly continued Quinn we cannot take him with us onour tour of observation
It will be best to leave him locked in the car
will close the trap leading into the storeroom and do not think itwill be possible for him to work much damage in the room below
dont know what good it will do me to go out with your exploringexpedition said Popham dejectedly in country as hot as this therecan be no earthly use for coal
Or wearing apparel added Meigs listlessly
Cotton couldnt grow insuch temperature
And as for wheat
He shook his head wearily
Cotton and wheat were the abc of his Wall Street experience
Beyondthose commodities he groped in the dark
What sort of food can be grown on such sunbaked planet
The railway man was shouting something about watered stock and hisbabbling was wafted up to us
Gilhooly added Markham is the only fortunate man in the party
Realization will blast the hopes and mayhap prove the death of the restof us while hehe cannot realize
You gentlemen lose courage too quickly said the professor
In mylectures on Venus told you how that planet was inclined to the planeof its orbit
The axis of Mercury has still greater inclination infact the orb leans on itself as though about to fall
Its days are ofabout the same length as the days of Terraonly three minutes longerbutits years owing to its contracted orbit are much shorter
Ineightyeight days Mercury makes its round so that each season is onlytwentytwo days in length
At the poles of Mercury in what answers to the polar regions of ourown earth there must be more tempered climateThen let us get there by all means cut in Popham
In whatever we do answered Quinn we must make haste slowly
Lets get out and look around anyhow cried Meigs
It may happenafter all that we have world to conquer here and have not thepatience to remain longer in this steel cell of yours
Very good returned the professor
We will make our preparations andgo forth
He shut off the flow of oxygen from the tank and then followed the restof us to the under apartment closing steel door over the trap at thehead of the stairs and locking it
Gilhooly imagining himself aconductor was walking around the edge of the circular divan collectingtickets from imaginary passengers
Sing Sing
he called out as the professor unlocked the door at theentrance and pulled it open
Heres where you get off Munn said Meigs maliciously
Heres where we all get off returned the professor smiling
Thereupon we passed hastily into the blinding glare of the Mercurialday
For several minutes our eyes rebelled at the brightness whenfinally they became inured to it we looked around us upon desolationthat struck dismay to our hearts
We saw then that our car had alighted upon an elevation which wasnothing less than the rim of an extinct volcano of vast proportions
From ridge to ridge across the abysmal crater at least half mile couldbe measured
It was beyond the power of our eyes to penetrate to the black depths ofthe great pit
cried the professor his voice resounding so thunderously asalmost to deafen ussome trick of the atmosphere
We stood silently our ears alert and heard confused babel of soundproceeding apparently out of the very core of the volcano
SubMercurial fires may be at work down there whispered theprofessor nodding toward the crater
Even the whisper sounded unpleasantly loud to us
What world
came from Augustus Popham in bellowing tones
Withfire within and without what chance is there for life liberty and thepursuit of happiness
Some of Meigs peevishness had got into the coal man and he rent theair with it
We remained mule after this outburst with my gazehopefully on the professor and the professor blinking at the sun
In little time allowed my own eyes to falter zenithward and theglory of the sun in Mercurys midheaven has ever since been one of thetreasured memories of my life
Its disk was six times its diameter asviewed from Earth and the grandeur of its flaming surface is beyond thepowers of my feeble pen to make known
was oppressed and held captive by feeling of awe and wonder
Therewas red tinge to the atmosphere caused by reflection from the redof the planets bricklike crust through this warm color pulsed thegolden streamersyellow and scarlet overhead fading to faintest orangeon the horizon
Think you Mr Popham murmured the professor his voice awakening usas from trance that all yon splendor which has been in these skiesfor ages upon ages was created for the enjoyment of no living thing
If so you are wrong
There are now as there have always been beingswith an intelligence capable of appreciating all this magnificentprofusion of light and color
But enough
We have looked down into thecrater and up into the heavens suppose we turn our eyes another way andsee what there is to offer
He faced about as he spoke and gazed down the bare rocky slope of thevolcano and off across an equally bare and forbidding plain
No trees no water no life of any kind muttered Meigs querulously
There is bright spot over there said Quinn shading his eyes andpointing
Our eyes followed his finger and encountered glittering object on aslight elevation
As we gazed the object whatever it was slowlyvanished
We might investigate that suggested Popham excitedly
Perhaps itwas Mercurial wearing sort of armor to protect him from the heat
It may be that there are people here and that they live underground
He would have started forthwith but the professor stretched out handand detained him
Just moment said Quinn
Before we get too far from the car letme make sure that all of you are sufficiently immune from the heat
Doyou feel that you are fully protected in that respect gentlemen
So far as was personally concerned had not felt the slightestinconvenience from the suns rays
declared as much and the otherslikewise so expressed themselves
Theres another one of the things
spoke up Meigs pointing in anotherdirection
We were just able to detect glow on another low elevation when it alsoflashed into thin air
Then we began looking for the little hills andcounted no less than dozen within our range of vision
Some of the hills were capped with the mysterious gleam which dazzledfor time and then twinkled out
The professor was perplexed as could see plainly
Well examine one of those hills said Meigs and find out what thismeans
The top of the volcano where we were standing was perhaps five hundredfeet from the plain
As Meigs spoke he leaped for rock yard or sobelow him
To the astonishment of all of us he rose in the air like humanballoon soared over the rock by score of feet and alighted severalrods down the slope
It was titanic jump but Meigs had regained foothold with thelightness of piece of down
He was large man was Meigs hisponderosity exceeding two hundred pounds Fairbanks
He was as much surprised at his agility as we were and began to essayvarious feats
He leaped straight upward gaining maximum height of adozen yards and returning lightly and easily to his original position
Next he coupled his leap with an aerial somersault and carried on withan abandon much beneath the dignity of Wall Street broker as itstruck me
In fact he acted like schoolboy out for holiday and sofull of animal spirits he hardly knew what to do with himself
Youd think he belonged to circus observed the disgusted Popham
Ill go down there and put stop to the performance
And Ill go along and help added Markham visibly distracted becauseof the brokers folly
They started down the steep with rodlong steps and presently one wouldhave thought they wore sevenleague boots from the amount of speed theydeveloped
Instead of putting stop to the brokers performance they joined in
By and by they were playing leapfrog every bound taking them forwardhalf hundred feet
Gravity here is far from having the force it has on Terra remarkedthe professor
Exertion comes easy and gives most astonishing results
Those men Mr Munn are not used to such activity yet their marvelousgymnastics do not seem to tire them in the least
Suppose that weourselves make test of the Mercurial gravity
needed no second bidding and Quinn and took the descent asbuoyantly as thistledown before the wind
Somehow the lightness of ourheels got into our heads and the staid professor and myself begancavorting like pair of tenyearolds
The delightful freedom of movement was as novel as it was exhilarating
Liberty of muscle bred license of mind had we been smoking opium wecould not have acted more outrageously
Nor was there any fatigue apparent
felt that could have run ahundred miles in as many minutes and never paused for breath
Carried away by the wonderful effects of diminished gravity we forgotall about our projected investigation of the little hills
In the midstof game of tag we were suddenly brought to our senses with roundturn
pall had fallen over the landscape
The sun was blotted out by inkyclouds and tremendous wind began to blow
We must get back to the car
cried Quinn
His voice great in volume though it was was all but drowned in theshriek and roar of the blast
The lightness that had afforded us somuch enjoyment in still air now became source of grave danger for wecould not keep our feet in the fury of the tempest
Merciful powers
roared Popham as he and Meigs were driven againsteach other with terrific impact
Although sorely put to it to keep myself from being blown away Imanaged to cling to rock and watch the weird gyrations of the twomillionaires
Their collision had caused them to lose their footingand clinging desperately to each other they were hurled back andforth touching the ground now and then only to rebound from it likerubber balls
And all the time this groundandlofty tumbling was goingon both men were whooping frantically for some one to come to their aid
was too hard beset to think of leaving my place of temporary refugeand it was only when saw the professor and Markham their right handsclasped staggering toward the two men that made up my mind to jointhem
Three of us in chain might be able to do something towardrescuing Popham and Meigs
Breathing deep like swimmer about to plunge through whirlpool Icast myself adrift and allowed the wind to drive me in the direction ofthe professor and Markham
No matter how strongly braced backwardagainst the blast every time lifted foot was hurled onward andalmost overturned
Finally more by good luck than anything else Icame close enough to catch the professors hand
Popham and Meigs will be killed if we cant get to them
There were eddies in the wind like those in the swift current of astream and Popham and Meigs had become entangled in them
Had theybeen blown off on straightaway course they would long since have beentoo far away for us to do anything toward laying hands on them andgetting them upright
The professor had taken note of the gyratory movements of our haplesscompanions and he called upon Markham and me to plant ourselves asfirmly as possible and remain in our present positions
This was easiersaid than done yet by calling upon every ounce of our reservestrength we contrived after fashion to keep our places
Popham and Meigs were bounding and leaping through the arc of greatcircle
All we had to do was to remain where we were and wait for them
They came to us in midair and we had literally to reach up and pullthem down
For space the five of us were tangled in an indiscriminateheap our united weight offering greater resistance to the wind andgiving us an opportunity to rest and collect our scattered wits
Join hands cried the professor and well get under the lee of thatrock
Careful now
We must not get separated again
By desperate work we succeeded in getting to our feet and claspinghands then hurled and buffeted we gained the rock and fell breathlessunder the leeward side of it
What place what place
groaned Popham
wish Venus hadnt been out of our course wailed Meigs
Certainlywe couldnt have been any worse off there than here
No wonder nothing can grow on this sunscorched world growledMarkham
Even if plants could stand the heat such wind would pullthem up by the roots
What are we to do now
demanded Popham
You got us into this Quinnand youve got to get us out of it
Nows good time for you three to go off to the other side of theplanet remarked
Whenever theres danger you suddenly realize thatyou cant get along without the professor
Oh youre fine lot ofnabobs you are
Peace Mr Munn called the professor
We have enough to occupy ourminds without wasting time in useless bickering
was at fault for Iknew what terrible gales visit this planet and that they come suddenly
It was mistake to venture so far from the car
mistake breathed Meigs with some heat that came near havingtragic consequences
Popham and were knocked about like couple offootballs
Whats to be done whats to be done
cried Popham impatiently
Thegale is increasing and who knows but this rock may be plucked up bodilyand rolled over us
We cant stay here
That is true said the professor
We must get back to the car
Theres no telling what will become of us if we try that calledMarkham
And theres no telling what will become of us if we remain hereanswered the professor
If we form chain it is quite possible thatwe may succeed in getting back to our refuge
Even the car may not be able to stand up against this wind clamoredMeigs
We shall have to take our chances with it nevertheless went onQuinn
If we should get separated each of us must make the bestpreparations he can to weather the gale and then when it has blownitself out hunt for the car
That must be our rendezvous during thetime we are here
The professor got up slowly bracing himself against the fierce swirlthat came around the side of the rock
Come he called it is now or never
could see that the gale had increased alarmingly
Its force seemedirresistible and yet knew that we could not remain where we were
We clasped hands again but were unable to cling together being liftedhigh and thrown helterskelter in all directions
Lightningflashedsuch lightning as have never seen before or since
It snapped and crackled overhead and ran like trailing serpents over therocks
We were in sea of flame
And the thunder
It seemed to split the heavens and crack open thelavalike hills
Rain came yet not rain for it turned to damp vaporin the redhot atmosphere
The Mercurial elements were at warwindsteam thunder and lightning all marshaling their hosts and charging toconflict
To regain the steel car was impossible
We were lost in the fearsomefury of darkness and storm driven helplessly and with smashing forceacross the vast plain
was hurled against something which gripped with convulsive energy
The something gripped me in return
cried bereft of my wits and eager only for rescue
shouted voice
Is this you
We must hang together
said Quinn
And then tightly locked in each others arms we were lifted high on abillow of fog and driven relentlessly know not how far
When the blast released us we fell to the rocks and rolled over andover then the surface beneath us gave way and we dropped
The distance we fell could be only matter of guesswork and evenguesswork was out of the question in the disordered state of our mindsat that moment
Suffice to say the fall did not render us unconsciousand we struck on something that vibrated under the impact of our bodies
We were still in blank darkness and the turmoil of the tempest nolonger beat about us but could be heard crashing somewhere overhead
Thank Heaven
murmured the professor withdrawing himself from me
Are you alive Mr
believe so answered
What has happened to us professor
We have been flung into some sort of shelter it seems to me hereplied
But we are not on stable ground he added
We are sitting on anobject that is descending with us descending rapidly andah wonder ofwonders
Abruptly we fell into broad day surrounded by such sights and soundsthat thought myself dealing with the mysteries of disordered dream
CHAPTER VIII
THE MERCURIALS
Professor Quinn and were sitting on large box constructed of metalthat was polished to dazzling brilliancy
So far as our purposes wereconcerned this box was nothing less than an elevator we had fallenupon it and it had carried us down into the wonderful interior of theplanet
Now truly we were in another worlda world that teemed with lifeasmiling and pleasant region underlying most barren and inhospitableshell
The scoriated exterior of the planet was the husk here was thekernel
It was white world extending league on league in every direction androofed with lofty vault that sparkled as with stars
From every handcame beelike hum proving that we were in hive of industry andlife
Houses spread out before us in rows queerly shaped structures thatlooked as though they might have been built of alabaster and sodiminutive that the tallest scarcely came more than head high
Back ofthe houses were fields thickly covered with nodding blossoms that lookedlike snow through the fields ran waterways dividing each into smallsquares
So intent were we on the background of this strange picture that wefailed to take account of what was going on in our immediate vicinity
Suddenly weird creature hopped to the top of the box and stood betweenmy companion and myself regarding us fixedly
This supposed wasone of the Mercurials
If he considered the professor and myselfobjects of curiosity and surmise we were no less keen in so regardinghim
He stood twentythree or twentyfour inches high his head was an ivorybilliard ball and his trunk larger spheroid from his middle downwardhung red kirtle
He had one eye at the front of the head and an earat the back the olfactory organ was missing but there was mouthopening perpendicularly under the eye
The upper spheroid rested directly on the lower and at each side of thelower one corresponding to the shoulders were two tentaclelike armssinuous as whips and ending in hands that were made up of palm andseven digits
Queerest of all there were two more arms set in thebreast and back
From the creatures shoulder was suspended round object like acanteen
For all of five minutes Quinn and eyed this surprisingfigure and were eyed in return
Can you talk English
asked the professor at last
It was foolish question such as was far from expecting from theprofessor but something had to be said and suppose that was as goodas anything else
As the professor began speaking the head whirledsquarely around presenting the ear
After my companion was done the head spun back again and the breastarm caught the canteen while the fingers of shoulder arm beganmanipulating set of keys
The result was language with all thevariations of tone and accent
But it was an unknown tongue if anexpression of that kind may be allowed in such case
Since the wordbox was as ineffective as our own speech we fell backwith more success on the language of signs
At this the Mercurial hadthe better of us for he could make signs with four hands
The professor signified that we were hungry and the Mercurial signifiedthat we were to descend from the box
This we did and found ourselvesin the centre of group of Mercurials whose wordboxes were chatteringlike so many magpies
The Mercurial with whom we were already on gesticulating terms playedoff some orders on his own canteen and two of the others advanced uponthe box from which we had just descended
Pulling out slide in theside of the receptacle they exposed two ewers of steaming food and wewere motioned to fall to
We stood not upon the order but obeyed instantly using pair of smallpaddles which were thrust into our hands
had no idea what the foodmight be but it was tender and of good flavor
bright little people observed the professor as he ate
Seemingly responded
Nature has denied them the power of speech yet see how they havesurmounted the difficulty
must give that talking machine of theirs aclose inspection
We are in most wonderful country Mr
The little have seen of it already quite dazes me said
What apickpocket man could make of himself with all those hands
Quinn gave me reproachful look and hastily apologized for evenmentioning branch of my profession
Do you understand now said he turning the subject very pleasantlywhat those bright objects were which we saw on the tops of the lowhills
No said
They were ovens he answered
Food is put in them and sent up to thehot surface of the planet
When properly cooked it is lowered again
Association with this learned man was liberal education in itself
Ican never be sufficiently thankful to fate for causing our paths tocross
You think then said that we were blown to the top of one of thehills and fell into shaft used by the traveling ovens
Nothing else could have happened
The professor gave start and looked worried
Dear dear
he exclaimed
was quite forgetting our friends
Whilewe are here feasting and taking our ease they are battling with thestorm and are no doubt in peril of their lives
How very verythoughtless we are Mr
was not greatly exercised over the matter
The trust magnates believedthat there was figurative gulf between myself and them and was morethan willing that this gulf should grow from the symbol to the reality
doubt if we can return to the outside of the planet at presentprofessor said and even if we were able to do so what could weaccomplish in the face of that tremendous storm
True very true said he
That oven said by way of taking his mind from the plutocratsmust have been very warm when we landed on it and descended to theseregions
We should have been grilled sir returned the professor but for thefact that we are coated and our clothing impregnated with myantitemperature fluid
These Mercurials appear to stand the heat pretty well remarked
Covered as we are with the antitemperature compound he returnedit is impossible for us to judge even approximately of the degree ofheat that obtains in these subMercurial regions
Naturally it must bevery much less than prevails on the surface of the planet and yet evenat that if left unprotected we should probably be shriveled tocinders
Hardly professor ventured to protest
Those fieldsand wavedmy paddle toward the open countryare growing rank with white herbwhich is evidently cooked in these ovens and served for food
Quitelikely we are eating of it now and very good eating find it
Howeverthe point wish to make is this If the heat was so intense as yousurmise those fields would be wilted and dried up
Nature Mr Munn answered the professor adapts itself to everycondition
On our own planet we see how life and comfort are renderedpossible in every zone from the farthest north to the tropics and thissame adaptability of intelligent creatures to their environment we maybe sure proceeds throughout the universe
These oneeared oneeyeddiminutive creatures are formed in the manner best calculated to affordthem comfort and happiness amid these surroundings
And as with themso with the products of their husbandry
You could argue squirrel out of tree professor said withwholesouled admiration
am sorry did not take course ofscientific training for it would have helped me immensely in mybusiness
burglar should be an allaround man
If ever return toTerraSo long as you feel as you do regarding your odious profession MrMunn broke in the professor compressing his lips you will neverreturn to Terra
return is possible
asked hiding the wonder his words aroused
Anything is possible
How about the millionaires
Are they to return provided the means areat hand
Provided they experience change of heart
In their present state ofdelusion they are mere firebrands of destruction
Before they everagain take part in mundane affairs they must be taught to see thingsdifferently
wonder what has become of them
The professors brow clouded with anxiety
Dont fret about them professor said
They are not overeager forour society
Let them have taste of shifting for themselves withoutyour knowledge and resourcefulness to shield them from everything thatgoes wrong
It will do them world of good
Perhaps you are right Mr Munn my companion answered musingly
IfI could know they had survived the storm should feel tolerably easyin my mind
These little Mercurials appear to be friendly people andif our comrades escaped that frightful tempest they must sooner or laterfall into the hands of these dwellers of the underworld
suppose ventured seeking to draw my companions mind from theplutocrats that this Mercurial underworld is another illustration ofthe way Nature takes care of her protégés
After baking the outsideshell of the planet to degree that makes all life impossible shethoughtfully scoops out the interior so that these small creatures willhave place to go
You have stated the case correctly Mr Munn and the professors facelighted up as he swept his gaze over the country immediately adjacent
These ovens he proceeded are remarkable example of adapting meansto an end
The fierce heat of the surface does the cooking
Popham will find little pleasure in that laughed
Like the rest of us answered the professor grimly he will have toaccustom himself to new conditions
Everything must be different here from the surroundings with which wehave been familiar all our lives
wonder what form of property isconsidered most valuable to these Mercurials
The professor frowned
My mind was running in its old groove despiteits novel environment
That query was inspired by an unworthy motive Mr Munn said Quinnseverely
bowed humbly
Every man his own way said
cannot help tryingto adjust myself along the line of the principles know best
Nevertheless am of an intensely curious disposition and thosetalkboxes fill me with wonder
The Mercurials are dumb it seems answered the professor and theyhave to resort to purely mechanical means for an exchange of ideas
Language appears to flow readily enough from the little boxes
If any one of them ever lost his four hands observed he would notonly find it impossible to help himself but would be unable to tellothers what to do to help him
Nature has been prodigal with them inthe matter of hands and in this no doubt showed her usual wisdom
am glad to see your thoughts taking philosophical trend Mr Munnsaid the professor
It argues well for your future
By that time we had emptied the receptacle of food and as we droppedour paddles and drew back the wordboxes of hundred Mercurialsshrieked despairingly
The pygmies clustered about the empty basinsglared into them and then turned their menacing eyes on the professorand myself
Goodness me Mr Munn exclaimed the professor
We have probablyeaten the food supply of the entire district
If we do not have careour voracious appetites are like to prove our undoing
Look there comemore of the Mercurials
Theyre after their supper Ill warrant andthey are going to be disappointed
looked in the direction indicated by the professor and saw longline of billiard balls rolling our way
It was procession headed by pompous little Mercurial whose trunkand arms were gorgeously gilded
With two of his hands he carried ametal plate and spoon and with the other two he wielded silver batonabout the size of match
Plates and paddles were also carried by the rest of the advancingMercurials their wordboxes chanting sort of quickstep
The sight ofthe professor and myself towering mountainlike over the throng aboutus brought the procession to an abrupt halt with squeak of dismay
The gentleman in the red kirtle went forward and held converse with thegentleman of the gilt torso
Before they got through their wordboxeswere fairly roaring and stricken groans went up from every talkmachinein the line
The advent of two leviathans like my companion and myself must have hada demoralizing effect but that seemed as nothing in comparison with theharrowing results of our voracity
The leader raised his baton
Silence fell
The leader then advanced towhere we were standing and circled around us examining us criticallywith his solitary eye
The survey finished he tried his wordbox on us the professoranswering in all the languages of our home planet living and dead ofwhich he was master
But in vain we could not come to anunderstanding
The begilded gentleman finally gave over and whirled on the underling inthe red kirtle
His fingers flew over the keys of his canteen andspeech of swift and commanding kind was poured out
skurrying about of the oven tenders resulted
From somewhere freshsupply of uncooked food was brought and placed in the huge metal box
While this was going forward Quinn suddenly seized my arm troubledlook crossing his face
What is the matter professor
Matter enough Mr
he answered
The lever was left on NumberFive
His thoughts were up with the steel car
was surprised at this forit appeared to me that there was more than enough to claim our fullattention right in our immediate vicinity
And what of that sir
The antigravity cubes lighten the car by five degrees he answeredexcitedly
Thus buoyed and in its elevated position doubt if thecar should hold its own against the fury of the storm
You think it has been blownAye
Blown to the uttermost parts of Mercury and perhaps wrecked andlostlost with all our scientific apparatus and other paraphernalia
ButAnd that is not all went on the professor
The lever should havebeen thrown to zero and then removed to prevent Gilhooly from tamperingwith it
Who knows what that mad railway magnate may take it into hishead to do
Suppose he were to grasp the lever and give the cubes theirfull power
He would be launched into the void sir and we should bemarooned on this sunbaked planet compelled to live out our lives withthese oneeyed quadrumana devastating the country of its foodsupplyour presence curse instead of blessing
had already imagined possible return to Terra and from this itseemed that the professor had not lost sight of that contingency
What is to be done
asked catching some of his excitement
We must return to the outer shellwe must find the carwe must go backon the oven when they send it up
As he finished speaking Quinn ran frantically to the metal box andleaped to its top
followed clumsily upsetting half dozenMercurials who chanced to gel in my way
The oven was loaded by that time and ready for its return to the intenseheat nay more the chef in the red kirtle already had his hand on awheel which presumably released the lifting power
Our movements however had acted as check on proceedings
Weve got to go back
cried the professor forgetting in his stress offeeling that his words were lost on the throng around us
Dontattempt to stop us dont
Well returnThe Mercurials began leaping to the box from all sides in veritableswarm
Carried away by the excitement of the moment sank to my kneesand swept my arms about me throwing them back pellmell
The professor also resorted to violence
In the midst of it all Icaught glimpse of the gilded gentleman aiming his baton
moment more and there was lurid flash which enveloped my companionand myself in billow of violet fire
Every atom of strength was drawnfrom my limbs and fell limply to the ground with the professor on topof me
CHAPTER IX
LEARNING THE WORDBOX
It was not the violet fire that did the work for the professor and me
Rather it was some chemical known to the Mercurials and whichmanifested its presence by an overpowering odor
Long after we had regained consciousness the druglike smell clung toour clothes and sapped our strength
Shackles of iron could not havebeen more effective in making us prisoners
Cords were made fast to our feet and we were dragged by small army ofMercurials down the principal street of their city and out into one ofthe white irrigated fields
Had dwelling been found large enough presume we should have beencomfortably housed but we were of such stupendous proportions thatthere were no walls capable of containing us
When we reached the field ring foot high was reared about us
Asthe odor lessened and my strength increased tried to roll over thislow barrier but received such shock that was only too glad to rollback to the professors side again
It is of no use Mr Munn said the professor who had been watchingmy attempt
These Mercurials are possessed of ways and means beyondour earthly powers to combat
We must accept the situation with all thephilosophy we can muster
This great man who could remain unshaken under any fate that befellhim was constant source of strength and inspiration to me
While welay forsaken by our captors and couched on the strange white herbage ofthat underground field our discourse drifted along many channels
remember that asked him question concerning matter that had longbeen weighing upon my mind
How is it professor said that your antigravity compound remainsin liquid state in an open cask
should think its inherent energywould cause it to fly upward en masse
can demonstrate that by means of an algebraic formula said he
Are you acquainted with algebra
No answered humbly
Then he went on disappointedly fear you will have to remain inignorance
You must rest content with the evidence of your sensessince an explanation in terms you can understand is impossible
And thus the matter rested
When we were so far recovered as to be ableto rise we made an attempt to step over the ring that hemmed us in butwere shocked by the same unseen power had already encountered anddriven back
See with what weapons nature has provided these people
murmured theprofessor
Throughout the universe everywhere you will find Mr Munnthat Nature takes care of her own
Ah here comes Captain Goldman
Retainers follow and they are bringingnow what are they bringing
Why as live they have manufactured couple of large wordboxes
Evidently we are to be taught the use of them
The professor was right
Ever since our disastrous attempt to regainthe surface we had been tabooed by the inhabitants of the country
Captain Goldman as my companion referred to the little man who hadused his mysterious baton with such telling effect was crossing thefields toward us followed by six of his countrymen bearing the talkingmachines
As precautionary measure the captain carried his weapon
Arriving at the ring Captain Goldman reversed the baton and with theblack tip of it cut an imaginary doorway for himself in the air
He thenstepped through and joined us without shock or resistance
Thus by means to us inexplicable he broke the power of the circle at agiven point
The others followed him through the entrance he hadcleared
Wielding the baton with two of his hands Captain Goldman beganmanipulating his wordbox with the other two
He was not addressing ushowever but those who had come with him
Three of his followers advanced to me with one of the machines whilethe remaining three conveyed machine to the professor
At once ourinstruction in the art of mechanical speech began
It is not my intention to burden the readers with the details of ourlessons although few remarks under this head may not be out of place
As to the wordbox itself it had seven keys
This made it somewhatdifficult for fivefingered creature to operate with any great degreeof fluency although the professor did get so he could peg out his ideasat remarkable rate
There are but six syllables in the Mercurial language each syllablebeing represented by corresponding key
The way these syllables werefingered gave the words
As they could be combined and repeated andcombined again the vocabulary of the boxes was practically unlimited
The syllable notes were of resonant quality and of such divergent timberas to be quickly and easily recognized
The syllable for Key wassynonymous with our personal pronoun and was the most assertive anddetermined note in the whole gamut of the box
The seventh key emitted sound so utterly unlike the other sounds as tobe in class by itself
It was used for spacing between words forexclamatory purposes and for the audible expression of laughter andgrief
It was likewise the expletive or swearkey for these small egotists hadall the passions of other mortals and Key acted as sort of safetyvalve
The manner in which the key was used gave it its versatility
Day by day our lessons proceeded the professor learning with rapiditythat was marvelous
He was well along in the polysyllables while wasstruggling with the basic tones and acquiring some facility in spacingand in the expression of the feelings
Our ears kept pace with our fingers and in fortnight the professorwas so eloquent with his wordbox that he could now and then play off ametaphor or some other frill to the great delight of himself and hisauditors
Next to wonderful jimmy invented by cracksman named CricketDoniphan whom knew well and who at that period was doing time inStillwater take off my hat to that Mercurial wordbox as the mostmarvelous contrivance ever evolved by thinking mind
have verygood memory and when sufficiently proficient with the keys practicedby repeating passages from Forty Ways of Cracking Safes which asdistinguished from The Sandbaggers Manual considered my chefdoeuvre
could not discover that my terse English faulty enoughthough it was lost anything in force from translation into theMercurial tongue
The word tongue is used with reservations for ofcourse tongue that language was not
Difficulty was experienced in getting suitable Mercurial equivalentfor the good English word cracksman
Finally however hit uponthree quick touches of the swearkey which made the word intelligiblein my own ears if not to any ones else
Soon began to observe little throng gathering across my side of theprison ring listening intently as practiced
From day to day thethrong increased
Over on the other side of the ring Professor Quinn was absorbed incutting all manner of scientific capers with his wordbox
TheMutability of Newtonian Law formed his staple theme and he was able toput it through the keys with amazing variations
But no crowd gathered to listen to the professor
The Mercurials wereall on my side of the compound
Thus it was clear to me that my brandof science was more attractive to the little people than theprofessors
While The Mutability of Newtonian Law languished for anaudience The Sandbaggers Manual was fast acquiring one that taxedthe capacity of the wordbox
The professor for long time had been so wrapped up in his attempt tomaster the Mercurial language that he had paid little heed to me and myefforts
The attention my work was securing however finally causedhim to sit up and take notice
Halting his weighty remarks he laidaside his talk machine came over to my side of the circle and stoodbehind me listening
The first knew of his presence was the reachingof two angry hands over my head and the snatching away of the instrumenton which was at that moment reciting the ten rules for cracksmanssuccess
My audience was as greatly put out as was myself
While was leapingto my feet and whirling around my listeners were clamoring on theirwordboxes for me to proceed
Professor Quinn whitefaced and in greater temper than had everbefore seen him held my talking apparatus over his head and seemed of amind to clash it down on the earth at his feet
say professor called restrainingly dont do anything rash
Mr Munn he gasped his voice thick with suppressed emotion is myconfidence in you to be destroyed utterly
singled you out as one ofthe worthiest of all those brought from Terra and yet find you busilyinculcating false ideas of personal property into the keen minds ofthese Mercurials
For shame sir
Would you demoralize this planet
Would you turn these lawabiding people into thieves
Professor answered your ideas and mine do not harmonize on thismatter of property rights
While admit Mr Munn he answered that conditions on our ownplanet in measure condoned your actions yet maintain that you haveno right to air your ideas in Njambai
Here the conditions are of analtogether different sort
So far as have been able to learn this orbhas not fallen under the noxious spell of the monopolists
You have noexcuse for instructing the Mercurials in the alpha and omega of yourcontemptible profession
That is hard term professor
Besidesthey seem to be fond of the instruction
Everybody listens to me whileyou havent had so much as corporals guard to enjoy that astronomicalstuff you have been playing off on your concertina
Your line perhaps is more attractive than mine and the shadow of asmile curled about his thin lips for the notion of getting somethingfor nothing has direct appeal to every thinking being
On the otherhand my thesis on The Mutability of Newtonian Law requires profoundthought before it can be assimilated
Yet be that as it may shallnot allow you to degrade these people with the unworthy ideas that havebeen coming from your wordbox
can destroy this machine sir and Ishall do so unless you promise never again to let an ignoble thoughtcome out of it
What do you say
Your mere command is enough professor replied
It is notnecessary to couple it with threat
His face softened and he at once returned to me my talkproducer
beg your pardon Mr Munn said he
have confidence in yourword and know that can trust you
Thereupon he went back to his own side of the ring and applied myselfassiduously to undoing any evil my illconsidered practicing may havewrought
told the Mercurials that my utterances had been in thenature of fairy story and gave the lie to my convictions bydeclaring that the reasoning as in all fairy tales was unsound
From that hour my audiences vanished
The professor although his talkwas profound and somewhat wearying seemed to the Mercurials as moreworth while and they flocked to hear him
We began acquiring aknowledge of the country and of its people and institutions with ourvery first lesson
In two weeks we had gathered most of the informationthat followsTheir planet they called Njambai their country was Baigol
Baigol wasone of four kingdoms comprising the underworld of Njambai
The otherthree kingdoms were Baijinkz Baigossh and Baigaddall derived from theroot word bai signifying planet
There were only two places on Njambai where water was able to collectand defy the absorbing power of the sun
These places were at the twoends of the planets axis corresponding to the polar regions of Earth
Here there were seas feeding rivers that ran through the underworld andirrigated the fields
The kingdoms of Baijinkz and Baigossh lay on the shores of these seasthe former at the north and the latter at the south
They were the onlykingdoms on the outer shell of Njambai and levied tribute from theinterior kingdoms of Baigol and Baigadd for water rights
The distribution of light and heat throughout the nether kingdoms was bya system of gigantic reflectors located at either end of radius drawnthrough the equator
There was one stupendous reflector on either sideof the planet measuring no less than twenty spatli acrossa spatlbeing the equivalent of geographical mile
These reflectors we were told followed the sun as it moved through theheavens and reflected heat and light to countless other reflectorsingeniously placed to acquire and radiate the solar energy
The heat thus secured was further intensified by the planets shellwhich forming the vault of the nether kingdoms constantly diffusedwarmth
The king was Golbai the nine hundred and twentyfifth of his line
Thename of the pompous gentleman whom the professor had christened CaptainGoldman was Ocou
Names of people places and things as here given are simply rudeequivalent as nearly as can be rendered into English
From my wording the astute reader will probably discover more than thesix basic syllables of the Baigol language
The flexibility of thewordbox will account for this and the inconsistency is only seemingand not real
Baigol had one half the inner sphere and Baigadd the other half
Thesetwo kingdoms were not on the best of terms owing to wretched piece ofbusiness carried out by Gaddbai king of the other country which willbe adverted to later
The four kingdoms were connected by railway if such the mode oftransportation could be called
The roadbed was Vshaped grooveand the wheels of the cars were solid spheres with axles pierced throughtheir diameter
On these axles the carriages were supported
For people so wonderfully progressive the Baigols were strangelybackward in their motive power their trains being dragged byhandrelays of the small creatures taking them in charge
Owing to the diminished force of gravity large weights were easilyhandled and fair rate of speed was developed by the train haulers
But it was very primitive method of transportation
The trunk line connecting the nether kingdoms was known as the Baigaddand Baigol Interplanetary System
When two weeks of our enforced stayin Baigol had passed startling rumor was wafted from the wordboxesof the other kingdom to the effect that the management of the line hadsecured wonderful new traction power of tremendous speed and unlimitedendurance
The kingdom of Baigol was agog with excitement for the presidentvicepresident and board of directors of the Interplanetary were totake trial spin over the road in special equipped with their newmotive power
We had not yet been allowed to leave the mysterious circle whichimprisoned us but we could stand erect and so overtop the fields andhouses that we were able to see the railway station
Billiard balls came rolling in from every direction clustering aboutthe right of way and clambering to roof tops and other elevations thatwould afford an unobstructed view of the centre of excitement
At last far off the professor and heard thunderous shoutToot toot
No wordbox could have been the source of that echoing cry
Theprofessor gave gasp and clutched my arm convulsively
Do you recognize that voice
he asked hoarsely
Merciful powers MrMunn how could such thing happen
Over the fields beyond the city leaping along at fiftyfoot bounds anddragging behind him train of queerlooking cars crowded with officialsof the system came no less person than Emmet Gilhooly
The professor threw himself at the barrier that hedged us round
Hecould not pass although he struggled frantically
Take it coolly professor urged grasping and holding him upright
But this is outrageous Mr
he cried
Poor Gilhooly
Is hethe new traction power the other kingdom has been talking about
Howdoes he happen to be here
And why are they treating him like that
This must be stopped
Wheres my wordbox
His eyes swept the ground
Glimpsing his talking machine he dived forit and began working the keys like mad
No one paid any attention to the furious language that went up under hisfrenzied fingers however
Leviathan in harness absorbed the entireattention of all the Baigols and with another Toot toot
the railway magnate galloped out of sight
It was sad spectacle indeed
was almost as completely unmanned byit as was Professor Quinn
HOW WE WERE CATALOGUED
Let it not be supposed that we had given no thought to our companions inexile during our two weeks probation in Baigol
The professor and Ihad talked of them frequently wondering whether they were alive ordead and if alive where they were and what they were doing
Our story had been punched out of our wordboxes for the benefit of theBaigols but had not seemed to make much of an impression on Ocou or onothers who came to see us
Now the sight of Gilhooly would add corroborative detail and we harpedon that key until Ocou promised to communicate directly with KingGolbai and find out what his wishes were in the matter
As for the professor he wanted to go roaming the four kingdoms lookingfor the other exiles first visiting Baigadd and appropriating themotive power of the BBI
The most we could get from Ocou was promise to learn his majestyspleasure in our affairs and while we were abiding the kings decisionother events took place which were of prime importance to us
Ocou had queerlooking machine borne to our home circle which wasthe humorous fashion in which the professor referred to our prison ring
The machine was an upright shaft measuring some three feet in height
To its base was attached golden cord several yards long andterminating in small silver disk
Professor Quinn and were consumed with curiosity while thiscontrivance was being set up and made ready
We put question throughour wordboxes but were only smiled at mysteriously
Presently was made to sit down Turk fashion while one of Ocousattendants came to me and passed the silver disk over my head
One endof Ocous baton had black tip the other white
As the disk passed over my head Ocou rested the white tip of the batonon the pedestal
Instantly slide flew out of the shafts top bearing apainted ideograph
The professor and were not up in the Baigol ideographs and werevery much surprised at the actions of Ocou and his companions when theylooked at the slide
They recoiled stared at me suspiciously andmoved about me with caution
grabbed my wordbox
Whats the matter anyhow
We have just discovered that you are robber said Ocou
am no robber here answered no matter what was in the place Icame from
Once robber always robber retorted Ocou unless you touch theBolla
Well well
murmured the professor rubbing his hands delightedly overthe pedestal and giving little heed to Ocous remark
What do you callthis machine Mr
That sir Ocou replied is character indexograph
We find it veryuseful in cataloguing the natural tendencies of subjects of the realm
He sighed
The number of indexographs in the kingdom is limited and they have allbeen working overtime of late
This is the first opportunity we havehad to use one on you and your friend
Now professor if you willoblige me
The professor dropped down the disk gliding over his bald head andanother ideograph shot into sight
Ah murmured Ocou reading the sign philanthropist scientist manto counsel with Youll do sir but your friend
and he shook hishead sadly as he dropped his talking machine
suppose said watching Ocou and his attendants make off with theindexograph that shall be kept within this circle indefinitely
Let us hope not Mr Munn rejoined the professor laying kindlyhand on my arm
Rather let us hope that you will experience moralrejuvenation so that when the indexograph is tried on you at anothertime it will show different result
wish they would try that thing on Archibald Meigs
The Baigols would find think that have no monopoly on thatparticular ideograph
The professor laughed quietly
Let us see what comes to us now after we have been catalogued saidhe
think they have simply been waiting to make trial of ourtendencies before allowing us to pass out of this enchanted circle
Ocou came back in couple of hours carrying roll of parchment inaddition to his baton
He came alone
Gentlemen said he in his mechanical way your names have beenentered and tagged
In accordance with the information secured throughthe indexograph task has been set for you
Perform that taskfaithfully and you are to have the freedom of the realm
What is the task Mr
inquired the professor
You are to restore the sacred Bolla to his majesty the king ofBaigol
And what is the Bolla
It is the stone of happiness and peace
Merely to touch it restores amortal to health physical and moral
Crime is contagious diseaseand since the Bolla has been lost to us and untouched of any in thekingdom lawlessness has become widespread
Where is the Bolla
It was loaned some seasons ago to the king of Baigadd who now refusesto return it
As Baigadd is more powerful country than ours it wouldbe an act of destruction for us to make war for the stone
So our kinghas graciously decreed that Mr Munn shall proceed to the neighboringkingdom and steal the Bolla taking you along with him professor asadviser and general aide
Nothing could have pleased us more
As have stated elsewhere in this narrative stealing property fromsome one to whom that property does not rightfully belong can hardly beaccounted crime and when property thus purloined is restored to itsrightful owner the theft is transformed into high and noble act
Such task filled me with enthusiasm and was ready to go forth amongthe fourhanded enemies of Baigol and demonstrate my abilities
Theprofessor thinking of Gilhooly would have welcomed any undertakingwhich carried him into the neighboring realm
Ocou told us that the king of Baigadd was very grasping individualalthough he was very careful to abstain from touching the Bolla
Had hetouched the wonderful stone so great was its power that he would haveexperienced change of heart immediately and could not have shirkedreturning the property to its rightful owner
King Gaddbai was very wealthy according to Ocou drawing his revenuesprincipally from the kaka industry of which he had monopoly
Ka wasa fibrous plant from which kaka the only cloth known in the fourkingdoms was made
This plant would grow nowhere else than in Baigadd so that the peopleof the other three kingdoms had to go to Baigadd for their kirtles
Every time the king of Baigadd suffered pecuniary backset or donateda large sum to charity he recouped his exchequer by boosting the priceof kirtles
There was time Ocou declared when all the inhabitants of Njambaiwent clothed from neck to heels but wardrobes dwindled as the price ofcloth rose
Very few people could now afford the luxury of full suitand since the upper half of the body could not be covered with agarment it was covered with paintthe paint being usually of color tomatch or harmonize with the kirtle
variety of black kaka was the only serviceable material to be had forwriting purposes ideographs being traced on its surface with white ink
We were told how gentlemen once wealthy but who had fallen upon evildays had drawn upon their libraries for wearing apparel
Books of poetry essays travel fiction all yielded their leaves tothe making of various garments thereby clothing the body as comfortablyas they had already clothed the mind
What could be more apropos than morning gown inscribed with choiceideographic sonnets
Or students robe begemmed with the brilliant witof an essayist
Or traveling costume bearing an account of somevoyage of discovery
The only fault to be found with this arrangement was that such clothingadvertised the wearers poverty and in Njambai as in Terra the prideof wealth was most pronounced
King Gaddbai it appeared had so enhanced the cost of black kaka thatliterature lay languishing
Writers had not the requisite material onwhich to inscribe their thoughts and the four kingdoms were threatenedwith blight of ignorance
From what we heard of King Gaddbai the professor and were notdisposed to regard him very favorably
He seemed greedy andunscrupulous person more than ready to swell his coffers by tramplingon the rights and the welfare of others
The parchment roll brought by Ocou was map showing us how to directour steps in order to reach Baigadd
Ocou also delivered to us royalbanner direct from the hands of King Golbai which was to procure usfavor en route and entitle us to be received and cared for asambassadors when we reached the other kingdom
The professor asked for baton but this was denied him
The Baigolsfeared suppose to trust such terrible weapon in the hands ofaliens
The professors pleasure over the prospect of being allowed to leave ourprison ring and journey in search of our friends while seeking the Bollawas marred somewhat by Ocous revelations
He had hoped to find Njambai free of monopoly and greed and yet herewas King Gaddbai boosting the price of kaka whenever the whim struckhim and he had hoped to find people where poverty was unknown andyet he discovered how the educated were obliged to raid their librariesin order to cover their nakedness
Human nature professor expounded is the same all over theuniverse
If man finds himself in position to gouge his neighborhe is as apt to do it on Jupiter or Mercury as he is on Terra
am grievously discouraged he sighed
Furthermore said my practicing on the wordbox could not havecaused the havoc you imagined it might
Ocou tells us that since theBolla has been taken from Baigol lawlessness has been widespread andincreasing
Your rehearsal of the false sentiments contained in your book may havehelped on the lawlessness
am more sorry than know how to expressin finding among this gifted people some of the worst elements of ourown civilization
And my regret is the more pronounced on the score ofPopham Meigs Gilhooly and Markham
How do they figure in your disappointment
Cant you understand
he cried
had the same hopes of them that Ihad of you
Suppose we found on this planet not trace of monopoly orgreed suppose we had found here peaceloving justiceserving peoplewith plenty to eat and wear needing no laws to govern them and allhappy and contented
The moral effect upon you and the rest of ourfriends would have been uplifting
You would have seen admired andcoveted the same conditions for our own orb
change would have beenworked in you and for the better
That he went on passionately is the full measure of mydisappointment
So far from finding such conditions Mr Munn you areimmediately catalogued as thief and given task commensurate withyour supposed abilitiesa task or robbery
But righteous robbery averred
Recovering stolen property andreturning it to the rightful owner is meritorious act
We must call it so he answered bitterly since so much hangs uponour joint attempt
But what lesson for these poor benighted people
The ability to get the stone is beyond them and they call upon us Ipursued
Their action is flattering rather than otherwise
If wesucceed it means that we shall stand even higher in their estimation
We who ought to know better are making ourselves living examples ofsuccessful thievery
The end justifies the means professor
We must strive to think so
suppose Gilhooly has been catalogued the same as you and and thathe was found to stand so high in traction affairs that theyLet us not dwell upon poor Gilhooly
He is just where he ought to be declared
only wish he had aglimmering of sense still left him in order that he might realize hisposition
The effect would be salutary
This frank expression of my views rather startled Professor Quinn
Hewalked back and forth his hands clasped behind him and his head bowedin deep thought
The indexograph is most remarkable invention he finally observedand would be of inestimable value on our native planet
The detectionof crime would be an easy matter and on the testimony of theindexograph alone justice could be meted out without the intermediateapplication of the courts
Furthermore justice would never miscarry
hope exclaimed in panic that shall never live to see theday when the police officials of Terra are equipped with indexographs
It would prove knockout blow for my profession
Every citizen would betested and his proclivities jotted down in black and white
That would mean expanded the professor that crime would berelegated to the limbo of lost arts
Before lawless act could becommitted the artist in crime would be placed where the deed would beimpossible
Thats the way figure it out professor
But that is not the least of the indexographs merits
Children couldbe duly catalogued and if they showed criminal tendencies could besent to institutions for proper moral training
The inclination of theyoung toward certain trades could be learned and they could be giveninstruction along the line which would best serve their future careers
There would not be so many failures in life Mr
Perhaps not answered stubbornly but still maintain that theoverturning of our customary standards would land us in chaos
he exclaimed half angrily
Some day trust your angle ofvision will change materially
Until that time Mr Munn it would bewell for you to repress your peculiar views for you are going to besorry for them
Just three weeks to day from the time we reached Baigol we fared forthfrom the royal city bent upon the performance of our mission
We werearmed only with our wordboxes the kings standard and firmdetermination to achieve our liberty by securing the Bolla no matterwhat the cost
Our journey led us through pleasant country level for the most partand covered with irrigated fields growing the white blossoms which theBaigols gathered and cooked for food
The kings will as made known bythe banner secured us rest by the way
have not considered it necessary to refer to the fact that there waslight and darkness throughout the kingdoms of Baigol and Baigadd duringeach period of twentyfour hours and three minutes
Light and heat weresent through the underworld by means of the two huge reflectors alreadymentioned and when the sun passed from the heavens of course nightfell
But the climate was at all times delightful
We were armored against thetemperature and could not ourselves experience the equable air yet oureyes and ears assured us of its presence and this proved anothersurprise for the professor
By day we traveled and by night we rested often covering as many asfive hundred spatli in single day
Four days at that rate were tocarry us to the capital of the other kingdom
gathered much wisdom from the professor as we journeyed and therewere two of our conversations which made deep impression on me
Thefirst had to do with the reflectors that turned the suns rays into thebowels of the planet
Without the sun Mr Munn remarked Quinn indicating the white fieldsbeside us with gesture of the hand there could be no vegetable lifein Baigol
Those fields must be quickened to life by the solar rays orthey would be as barren as the outer shell of the planet
Finiteingenuity may always be trusted to accommodate itself to itsenvironment
can set the astronomers of Terra right on one mysteryat least
What mystery do you refer to professor
Why he answered luminous point has been detected by earthlytelescopes on the disk of Mercury
The phenomenon has been explained asa huge mountain whose top reflects the sun yet it is only one of thegreat reflectors fabricated by these ingenious people
Then at another timeProfessor said have you made any discoveries relative to thatpowerful little weapon which the Baigols know so well how to use
few he answered
The baton is called zetbai and its ammunitionis drawn from peculiar ingredient of the atmosphere
The white tip ofthe zetbai furnishes the destructive force while the black tip combatsand nullifies it
The inhabitants of this orb Mr Munn have weaponof such awful power in the zetbai that dozen of their number armedwith the batons could descend upon our own globe and devastate it
Well is it for Terra that means are lacking for interplanetarycommunication otherwise the Baigols and their fellowcreatures mightprove the Napoleons of the universe
Such contingency is terrible tocontemplate
Had the zetbai anything to do with that invisible power that stayed usfrom crossing the circular wall
It had everything to do with that
An unseen barrier was placed aroundusa barrier of zet drawn from the atmosphere by these Baigols and madeto serve their ends
Unlike powder and ball which destroy themselvesin creating destruction zet is indestructible it can be regatheredinto the zetbai and used over and over again
The resisting mediumcontrolled by the black tip of the baton is alone powerful to annul theenergy of the white tip
These were the points that impressed me
Another which we discussed butwhich did not appeal to me as logical or accurate had to do with theobject of our questthe Bolla
With all due respect to Mr Ocou said he was certainly talkingmoonshine when he described the Bolla
would not go so far as to say he was talking moonshine Mr Munnthe professor answered
There are stranger things in Heaven Earthand Mercury than are dreamed of in our philosophy
Take yourself forinstance
You are sick manNever sick in my life declared
mean morally went on Quinn
If crime is disease you willadmit think that you are sick
No averred am healthy in mind and body
take no stock in MrOcous assertionswhich ought to prove that am mentally sound takeit
But well get this palladium just the same for our libertydepends on it
Toward noon of the fourth day as we drew near the boundaries ofBaigadd we entered rocky and uneven country the welldefined road wehad been following cutting and circling through the low hills
When wewere well in among the bowlders frantic shout reached us from around abend in the road few spatli ahead
That was cry in our own tongue Mr
exclaimed the professorcoming to halt
Did you not hear it
It was certainly call forhelp
You are right sir answered
That was lusty English yell if Iever heard one
It was given by one of our friends of course
No doubt it is not hard to distinguish human voice from the bleat ofone of these Baigol wordboxes
Possibly the new motive power of theBB
Interplanetary has rebelled and is fleeing this way
No answered the professor excitedly do not think that shout camefrom Gilhooly
It was Ah Mr
At that instant Archibald Meigs came bounding into sight around thebend
But he was not the wellgroomed richly appareled Mr Meigs ofEarth and the steel car
His only garment was kirtle
He must have been surprised at seeing us but so great was his fear thathe did not show it
Panic left no room for any other emotion
Save mesave me from the soldiers
few dozen prodigious leaps brought him trembling to our vicinity andhe fell exhausted to his knees
CHAPTER XI
THE DILEMMA OF MR
My my
cried the professor
What has happened Mr Meigs
How isit that we find you in thiserforlorn condition
Im wretched man
wailed Meigs grabbing the professors knees inthe stress of his emotion
You have got to save me Professor Quinn
It was you who brought me to this awful planet and if am slain myblood will be upon your head
That was Meigs for you
Even in his dire extremity he did not forget toheap censure upon the head of our great savant
You are not going to be slain said the professor confidently
But these creatures are as venomous as centipedes
murmured Meigssuffering himself to be lifted erect by the professor
Therethey come now
Oh this is too much too much
Meigs got behind the professor
Turning our eyes toward the bend wesaw detachment of the Baigadd army just hurling itself into sight
We had made some acquaintance with military affairs in Baigol
Soldiers as may be surmised were armed with zetbais but wordboxeswere kept out of the ranks
Only officers carried talking machinesmatters being ordered on the principle that privates were to hear andobey
Each soldier wielded two zetbaisone with each pair ofhandsthereby enormously increasing his capacity for destruction
The fighting force of Baigol we had been informed although organizedon smaller scale was equipped and maneuvred exactly as was themilitary arm of Baigadd
The detachment approaching at doublequick in pursuit of Meigs was aswe afterward found company of Gaddbaizets or royal guards
Theynumbered fifty wore yellow kirtles had the torso gilded and werecommanded by single officer carrying nothing but wordbox
The sight of the professor and myself caused the Gaddbaizets to come toan abrupt halt
They had undoubtedly heard of us but they were far fromexpecting to encounter us there at that time
The officer was the first to recover his wits and approached the placewhere we were standing holding his talking machine over his head andpunching its keys vigorously
His first words were command to thesoldiers Hold your zetbais and make no move against these fiercecolossi until you get further orders from me
Then to usBehemoths
Whence come you and why are you protecting the monster inthe red kirtle
Meigs it could easily be seen was not on familiar terms with thewordboxes
So far as he was concerned the captains words fell ondeaf ears
We are from Baigol said the professor giving an amiable twist to hiswords by deft use of Key and come on an errand from the king ofthat country
This gentleman is friend of oursA friend
screeched the captains machine
He is thief and hasstolen hundred djins of kaka from our sovereign storehouse
thrilled an amused laugh on the seventh key of my own machine
How do you know he is thief
Did you try the indexographon him
Ill do the talking Mr Munn said the professor in our own tonguethen added to the officer There must be some mistake captain
Thisgentleman has very good reputation and would not commit theft suchas you describe
He bears the proof of it upon his person answered the captain
Itis the kirtle
Now djin is unit of measurement and corresponds to the inch of oursystem from which it follows that Meigs stood convicted of stealingabout eight feet of red kakaenough to make kirtles for score of theBaigadds
What are you harping about
asked Meigs
They say you are thief Mr Meigs said
he blustered glaring at the captain over the professorsshoulder
deny it sir deny it
He says you stole that kirtle you have on continued
man has right to clothe himself as well as he may answered Meigsaggrieved
do not count that theft
The country should see that aman is provided with respectable covering
This was too good an opportunity for the professor to let slip
Suffer your mind to drift back to your own planet sir said he
Itis your opinion that our government owes every poor man suit ofclothes
Archibald Meigs cringed under the blow
It was thrust at hisclothing trust and it found the weak point in his armor
Circumstances are different here he mumbled
In some ways yes in other ways no
King Gaddbai is the monopolistof this planet
He controls the kaka output and charges for itaccordingly
The captain of the royal guard was growing impatient
If you are here on an errand from the king of Baigol said he weshall be glad to escort you to the capitalbut not until you havesurrendered the giant who stole the kings property
Take us to his majesty returned the professor and we will explaineverything in satisfactory manner
But this the captain would not do and he became so threatening that weretreated behind barrier of bowlders
Display the banner Mr Munn said the professor and held up theroyal standard so that the captain could not help but see it
His oneeye gleamed insolently and he came as near swearing as the seventh keyof his wordbox would allow
Deliver up the thief he ordered or will command my men toannihilate you with their zetbais
It was certainly critical situation
had already had slightexperience with the overpowering properties of zet and didnt care forfurther acquaintance with it
Meigs was nothing to me
He would havestripped the coat from poor mans back if he could have had his wayon Earth and it afforded me secret pleasure to see him hoisted by hisown petard
The trust magnate did not fail to take note of the warlike movements ofthe soldiers
Cant you do anything to save me professor
he pleaded
We shall not give you up answered Quinn firmly
Can you think ofany way Mr Munn whereby we can extricate ourselves from thisdifficulty
have quick mind if do say it and happy thought presenteditself on the spur of the instant
Stooping picked up stone thenraising myself let the missile fly straight at the captain
His shoulderarms still held the wordbox above his head and the stonesmashed against it and carried it away
It was rather neatly done forthe captain himself was left untouched
cried the professor
You drew the fangs of the enemy by thattrick Mr Munn
You have rendered the captain mute and his men cannotact without orders
had already figured this out in my mind and it was presently provedthat had not gone far from the mark
The captain recovered thewordbox and attempted to use it but its mechanism was so disarrangedthat the order to attack became confused jumble that seemed to sound aretreat
The whole company whirled and fled their leader following andgesticulating wildly and helplessly with his arms
Meigs was saved forthe present and he should have thanked me for itbut he did not
Seating himself on bowlder he gazed pensively down at the red kirtle
This is what call the irony of fate said he in morose tone
Andthen on top of it all to be called thief
He leaned his bare elbows on his knees and dropped his face in hishands
How did this happen Mr
asked the professor gently
cried Meigs lifting his head with jerk and glaring atQuinn
It would never have happened but for you
Have you seen Gilhooly
went on the professor ignoring the reproach
Poor Gilhooly
sighed Meigs
He has become power in the tractioninterests of the country
The last saw of him he was hauling trainsthroughout the kingdom
We know that much already
How about Popham and Markham
groaned Meigs
Popham is working like galleyslave in coalmine and Markhamwell these little fiends are slowly starving him todeath
All Markham does is to wander about the kingdom with plate anda paddle begging food enough to keep body and soul together
Think ofit
And the great Augustus Popham owner of controlling interest inall the great anthracite and bituminous fields of Earth delving in themines of this planetno better than twodollaraday miner
Coal fields
What do they need of coal in theseunderground kingdoms
They use the coal in the kingdoms of Baijinkz and Baigossh which aresituated at the poles explained the professor
During the longnights in those countries certain degree of cold must prevail
Butand here Quinn turned again to Meigstell us what happened to youand the other two gentlemen during the storm which separated us
We managed to regain the car replied Meigs
We could not get in ofcourse because you had the key but we hung to the latticework at thewindows
am little hazy as to what happened after that but thinkthe car must have been picked up by terrific gust and thrown to thebottom of that crater in the volcano
murmured the professor looking at me
You remember Mr Munn Itold you feared something of the kind would happen
Proceed Mr Meigs added the professor
This is all intenselyinteresting
Was the car seriously damaged
havent seen the car resumed Meigs
hiatus followed the blowingaway of the castle and when opened my eyes again was prisoner inthe hands of legion of those oneeyed creatures
For two weeks waskept confinedan object of curiosity for the whole kingdom if couldjudge from the way the little imps flocked to stare at me
After time was led off to place where joined Popham andMarkham
Need tell you how affecting that meeting was
Popham shedtears and both Markham and myself were nearly unmanned
Our captors had some sort of contrivance consisting of small shaftand cord
One end of the cord was put to Markhams head and slideflew up on the end of the shaft
Then Markham was led off given aplate and paddle and cast adrift
Popham was the next one to have the queer machine tried on him
Whenhe was removed my turn came
Meigs wrung his hands despairingly
After the storm he continued with an effort my costume was not ascomplete as would have had it but those impudent creatures denuded mestill further
In selfdefense was forced to steal this red cloth andrun for my life
Oh it was terrible
Woe is me that should everhave lived to see this day
Some good may come out of this unfortunate experience Mr Meigs saidthe professor
almost shouted Meigs
Sir you express yourself strangely
Isit good to have man used to such luxury as have been fleeing throughthese rocky underground hills merely because he committed theft in orderto retain his selfrespect
Have care sir
Do not think for amoment that am under any misapprehension as to the real cause of mysorry situation
The king of this country is evidently man of humorous and practicalturn observed Professor Quinn after little thought
Theindexograph made him familiar with the natural bent of you threegentlemen and he is seeking to show you the error of your ways
OnEarth you were at one end of trust here you are placed at the otherend
Really think the experience will prove most wholesome
Archibald Meigs stared at the speaker with distended eyes
Is it possible said he that your brain has been turned likeGilhoolys
struck in
The professors head is as clear as bell
Hes got the right of this thing Meigs
The king of Baigadd is makingyou take little of the medicine you measured out in such large doseson the other planet
You are both crazy snarled Meigs
never stripped man to hishide and threw him out in the cold worldas the king of this country hasdone to me in figurative sense
You dont know how much evil you have done said Quinn an expressionon his face similar to the one had seen when he jerked the lever andshot us into the unknown
You have taken your pound of flesh MrMeigs but are now under the heel of monopoly yourself
cried Meigs
We will talk no longer about matter in whichyou display such poor judgment
Although have told you my story Ihave heard little of yours
Am to conclude that you and Munnpurposely cut loose from myself and my friends
After bringing us tothis miserable planet did you have the heart willfully to abandon us
Not at all Meigs said the professor hastily
wondered if Meigs had forgotten all about the attempt he and hisfriends had made to abandon the professor and me
He was one of themost inconsistent men have ever encountered
Like yourself and the others Mr Meigs continued the professor MrMunn and were taken prisonersBut you were not treated with the same barbarity as the rest of usburst out Meigs his small mind finding even that cause for temper
You who engineered the plot and plunged us all into these terrificdifficulties escape the consequences
What is that banner
We are under the protection of the ruler of the neighboring kingdom ofBaigol
That is the royal standard
Ah said Meigs bitterly you are even received at courtyou and aprofessed thiefwhile Markham Popham Gilhooly and are no more thanoutcasts
Is there no such thing as justice even on this disgustingplanet
Look at me
Look at meHis final request for us to look at him was frantic wail
He yankedsavagely at his kirtle and twisted his bare feet around in fearsomedejection
We are looking at you Mr Meigs observed the professor quietly
Do you find any pleasure in the spectacle
Does not my situation arouseeven spark of pity
do not ask Munn for his sympathy but youProfessor Quinn although criminally careless in evolving plans andcarrying them out are scientist and you must have heart
My heart is wrung with your misfortunes replied the professor gentlybut realize that desperate diseases require desperate remedies
What disease are you referring to snapped Meigs suddenly changinghis tack and what remedy
The disease that afflicts our common country and which you would denyand ridicule were even to name it
The remedy too you wouldconsider no remedy at all but useless infliction of discomfort andmental anguish
What you are undergoing Mr Meigs is not accidentalbut providential
The workings of fate are as marvelous as they areeffective
Patience little and we shall see what we shall see
This is no time for oracular remarks
scowled Meigs
Thesefourhanded oneeyed demons are forcing Gilhooly Markham Popham andme steadily toward destruction
Gilhooly daft as he is is pulling hisheart out on their ugly little transportation system Markham isgalloping from place to place pounding his paddle against his dish andbegging few morsels of food Popham is working like galleyslaveand his wages already insufficient to give him the necessary food herequires for his heartbreaking labor are being systematically cutdown as for me the army of Baigadd is at my heels
and inhis extreme discouragement Meigs gave vent to wild mirthless laugh
Baigadd and Baigol
They sound like expletives from our own goodplanet but altogether too mild to express the state of my feelings
Be calm adjured the professor with an apprehensive look at me
echoed Meigs brokenly
shall be as mad as Gilhooly if thiskeeps up much longer
He started forward with truculent air
Whatare you going to do for me Quinn
he cried
How are you going to getme out of this fix
Those infernal little soldiers went away buttheyll come back again
Then what
We are here in the role of ambassadors answered the professorandMunn an ambassador
sneered Meigs drawing away from me
And as such we are entitled to some courtesy at the hands of KingBaigadd
feel quite sure that when the higher authorities understandyou are my friend they will be lenient in their treatment of you
That is rather vague supposition on which to ground mans hopes oflife or death muttered Meigs
It is all we can fall back on Mr Meigs
There are but six of us onthis small planet and we must make the inhabitants our friends
If wedo not annihilation will overtake the lot of us
We were fools ever to land on Mercury in the first place pursuedMeigs still wild and unreasoning
He stamped with his bare foot to emphasize his anger and sharp stoneunexpectedly gave point to it
With howl of pain he caught his footin his hands
have never been called particularly hardhearted but somehow took ameasure of enjoyment out of all this
However had the grace to turnmy head and conceal the smile
You must be careful Mr Meigs warned the professor
Sit down andrest yourself
fumed Meigs just as though such thing were possible
amone of the miserable victims of your duplicity and if could haverecourse to the law of our planet for about an hour would soon putyou where you belong
Be sensible struck in perhaps illadvisedly
You act like awhipped schoolboy Meigs
Ill hear nothing from you he cried glaring at me
As was saying Mr Meigs proceeded the professor Mr Munn and Ialthough we appear to be free are nevertheless virtual prisoners ofthe king of Baigol
We are being sent to Baigadd upon an importantmission and on our success or failure depends very largelyThat will do interrupted the broker irritably dont care to hearan account of your experiences Quinn
It is evident think that youand Munn have not been crossed by the same adversity which has overtakenmyself and the others
have demand to make
Meigs arose from the bowlder and struck an attitude which he intended tobe both dignified and compelling
With his unshaven face and red kirtlehe succeeded only in making himself ludicrous
What is the demand
inquired Quinn
You and Munn are fairly wellclothed replied Meigs and demandthat you share my distress to the extent of donating enough of your ownclothing to make me presentable
On the impulse of the moment the professor began removing his coat
When the garment was half off he changed his mind and slipped back intoit again
No he returned
You have made your own bed Mr Meigs and thinkyou should lie in it until you experience change of heart
When youcan truly say to Mr Munn and me that you realize how sadly mistaken youwere on the other planet we will share your distressbut not tillthen
Out on you for pair of heartless wretches
exclaimed the brokerangrily
Your reasoning is false and will never yield assent to it
wash my hands of both of youand he went through the motionsand ifour paths should cross in the future it is my desire that we pass asstrangers
He glared at us turned on his bare heel and made his way to the road
Then he strode off in the direction of the bend
We watched him silently the professor with apprehension and withunrestrained enjoyment
As he was about to vanish from our sight we sawhim come to startled halt gaze off along the road that lay beyond thebend then throw up his arms whirl and race back to us
Theyre coming
he shouted frantically the whole army is coming
Isthere no way you can save me gentlemen
Think for mercys sakethink
Meigs was continually building barriers between himself and theprofessor and me only to knock them down again whenever the slightestdanger threatened him
Had been the one to decide he should then andthere have been left to shift for himself
CHAPTER XII
CONDEMNED TO DEATH
Have courage Mr Meigs said Professor Quinn
It is my hope thatsome high personage may be with the approaching army in which event theroyal banner given us by the king of Baigol will be respected and provethe salvation of all three of us
This great and good man was utterly incapable of harboring resentmentagainst any one
He beguiled the plutocrats into his castle grantyou and shuffled them from the scene of their grievous labors yet thiswas not because he loved the rich man less but the poor man more
As write these words piecing my narrative together out of mycommonplace book wave of affection and reverence rolls over me
And often steal forth nights when skies are propitious gaze atMercury through my telescope and can almost fancy myself in communionwith the gentle soul forever lost to its native planet
But Ianticipate
The retreating Gaddbaizets had reached headquarters and acquainted thehigh chief in command with the fact that two more colossi had appearedso the major part of the kings forces had been ordered out
By tactfulmaneuvres they were approaching from all sides
cordon was drawn around usa cordon of soldiers with their flashingzetbais presented
One hostile move would have placed the seal on ourdeath warrant
The high chief perhaps fearing his wordbox might be wrecked as hiscaptains had been had evidently laid plans and given all orders inadvance of his attack on our position
The assault was noiselessswift and sure
When completely surrounded by the troops number of the soldiersdisengaged themselves from various points of the circle
These soldierscarried lances at least ten feet long
The lances were held high and to the point of each the upper edge of anet was made fast the lower edge of the net trailing along the ground
As the lancemen advanced the net took the form of rapidly contractingcircle the professor Meigs and myself in the centre
In less than five minutes we three colossi were stoutly encompassed bythe net hurled together and thrown in helpless jumble
The web wasfinely woven and of material that defied our efforts to break throughit
Professor Quinn made fierce attempt to use his wordbox but he washeld so rigidly that he could not do so
One by one we weredisentangled the upper parts of our bodies were wrapped about insections of the net so that only our legs were free and we were forcedto proceed with our captors the army marching on every side of us
Meigs was loudly bewailing his evil fortune
Take heart man
cried Quinn
If can see the king or get word tohim am sure that all will yet be well
Its all day with us returned Meigs with groan and you cannotmake me believe otherwise
There was no twilight in the nether kingdoms
Day leaped into night asswiftly as curtain falls on stage play
Long before we reached our destination we were in Stygian blackness
There were no artificial illuminants known to the creatures of theunderworld and they had no need of them
Their single eyes were giftedwith power to see at night almost as keenly as in the daytime
When we had traveled several hours we were made to halt and circle ofzet similar to the one that had imprisoned Quinn and myself in Baigolwas reared around us
Thereupon we were freed of the nets and left toourselves
The instant he was able to make use of his hands the professor grabbedhis wordbox and began shooting questions into the opaque gloom thathemmed us in
Why have you taken us prisoners
What harm have we ever done you
Weare under the protection of King Golbai
Did not the captain of theother detachment so inform you
Answer came backYou have been taken prisoners because you resisted the royal authorityand tried to protect man who stole goods from our regal master
Theftof goods from his majestys storehouse is punishable with death
Evenambassadors from King Golbai are not above the laws of our realm
What is to be our fate
Zet was the laconic answer
You will all three be slain by theexecutionergeneral as soon as may be after the great reflector sendsits first gleam of day through the kingdom
That ended the professors talk with our unseen enemy who presumablywas the high chief of the forces
It was sufficiently discouragingalthough was reckless enough to ease my feelings with few expletiveson Key the most insolent and defiant that had learned in Baigol
Mr Munn Mr
cried Quinn in rebuke
This is no time to expressyourself in that key
am not endowed with your magnificent forbearance professor said Iand had to say something
Whats it all about anyway
asked Meigs
We are to die at sunrise Meigs answered roughly or as soon aftersunrise as the executionergeneral may find it convenient
would have spared Mr Meigs that information said the professor
He ought to have time to prepare himself returned
As the nightis far spent am going to turn in and snatch forty winks against thetime the reflectors begin to work
Good night professor added asI stretched out on the ground
dont amount to much more than Meigsand will never be missed but am sorry for you
Quinn groped for my hand
Life in itself is small thing said he no matter whether it islong or short
It is what we do with life that counts Mr
have no regrets for what have done with mine declared
And had not
Conscience did not accuse me in the least
Never had Itaken penny from those who could not afford to lose it
Think again Mr
implored the professor
would not have youface your doom in that mental attitude
Surely your senses are notblunted to the evil of your past life
Sir answered imbued to the core with the sophistry that had mademe what was have been financier in small way
Not having therequisite capital for large operations was compelled to work in asmall way
My business however while it may not have been aslegitimate was every whit as honest as that of Meigs and hisassociates
If you men would stop that useless palavering called Meigs fromsomewhere in the dark and try to think of some way for making ourescape you would be putting in your time to better advantage
Never mind him professor said
This is probably the lastopportunity we shall ever have for an extended talk
At such time aman speaks from the heart and want you to know just where stand
Just moment Mr
The professor turned his head to answerMeigs
It is impossible for us to escape said he
Even if we couldget away from here we should find the entire country in arms againstus
Possibly we could get back to that other benighted kingdom from whichyou and the thief come accredited as ambassadors
returned Meigs
It is hard journey from here Mr Meigs and we should be overtakenand recaptured before we could cross the border into friendly country
Before we could take to flight however we should have to beat down thebarrier of zet that hems its in
That as know from experience isout of the question
Meigs began to complain and to find fault and the professor turnedfrom him and went on talking with me
have brought these troubles upon you Mr Munn he continued sadnote in his voice and upon the others
It seems impossible toaccomplish any great good without causing some small amount of misery
Dont let my situation worry you remarked
While constantlyexercising my wits to secure the best fortune for myself have alwaysmade it point to be prepared for the worst
shall face the zetbaisin the morning without the quiver of an eyelid
Dont misunderstand me Mr Munn said the professor earnestly
While grieve that matters should have fallen out in this fashion yetI would not undo the one thing which brought us into these troubledwaters
In other words would rather be here in Njambai with deathstaring us in the face than back there on Terra with Meigs MarkhamPopham and Gilhooly free to work out their nefarious plans
Thats the spirit
cried warmly
Its the spirit that has put many man in the penitentiary calledMeigs who appeared to be following our conversation even if he was nottaking any part in it
turned with stinging reply on my lips but the professor dropped ahand on my arm and held my peace
We are sharing together our last few hours said he and let us haveno quarrelsome talk
Personally have good deal of charity forMeigs
He is man who until very recently has been accustomed tohaving scores of people wait upon his slightest nod
Here he has beensubjected to much indignity and at the hands of people whom hebelieves to be his inferiors
Naturally that renders him disagreeable
He might at least have the grace to leave you alone answered
Not so Mr Munn
He is perfectly right in badgering me
am atfault so far as he and his associates are concerned and he knows it
Ido not expect approbation at their hands but at the hands of those infaraway Terra whom my drastic actions have helped
Your calmacceptance of your fate is so different from the attitude of Meigs thatit touches me deeply
You have the same cause to blame and abuse meand yet you let the opportunity pass
It has been worth something professor responded to stand at yourside and to pass through these remarkable adventures shoulder toshoulder with you
Thank you for that my friend
have no doubt continued that if you and were to be sparedyou might in time lead me to see what you are disposed to call the errorof my way for you are master hand at arguing but as am atpresent feel that my chances in the next world are as good as anyones
The rich have taken from the poor in way that the lawsanctions and have taken from the rich in way the law does notsanction and in few rare instances have given to the poor
Theresnothing in that to oppress my conscience
The only thing am sorry foris that entered your castle with my felonious intention centred uponyour property
Now that know you so well my plan to steal from youlooks more like crime than anything else have done
Munn he replied it grieves me to think that your career is to becut short before you have had an opportunity to reform
Howeverand hesighed softlythere is no escaping fate on our own planet or on this
Good night to you
was dogtired and went off into slumber the moment closed my eyes
About the last thing heard was the peevish voice of Meigs resistingwhat little comfort the professor tried to offer him
was aroused by the professor
The first gleam of day Mr Munn said he bending over me with aquiet smile
rubbed my eyes and got the cobwebs out of my brain
Yes it was thefirst gleam of dayour last day
We were in an open square in the heart of diminutive city
From everyside radiated trim little streets bordered thickly with white dwellings
In front of us was palace rising dome upon dome until it stood fullthirty feet high
Inhabitants of the royal city were already abroadwalking rapidly or gathering in groups and using their wordboxesexcitedly
The familiar sounds came from distance and sprang erect and withthe professor gazed in the direction from which they reached us
Presently Gilhooly came along with loaded train
He halted in front of the palace the passengers disembarked andGilhooly bent over the cars picked them up carefully and turned themthe other way along the Vshaped groove
All aboard
he cried and minute later he was off and away
Poor Gilhooly
murmured Quinn
He is bringing excursionists towitness our execution
am glad that he does not know what he is doingand that Meigs is asleep
Quinn laid his hand on my shoulder
deeply regret Mr Munn he went on that am the indirect causeof Gilhoolys lunacy
It was great surprise to me to find that hisintellect was not strong enough to withstand the ordeal to which Isubjected it
It couldnt be helped professor returned
It was grand idea ofyoursthat of abducting these trust magnates and placing them where theycould do no harm to the poor of our planet
What though one mind hasbeen wrecked
Better that than the misery and enslavement of hundredsof thousands
Mr Munn said the professor with feeling thank you
Such wordsfrom companion who is about to suffer jointly with me the extremepenalty prove that you are man of parts and fitted for nobler walkin life than the one you have heretofore taken
am very very sorrythat you are to be cut off so soon
Quinn was fortitude itself his courage born of knowledge of duty welldone
am prone to believe also that myself was not less firmalthough less laudable cause lay back of it
The square should judge measured about two hundred feet on eachside
While the professor and were engaged in talk sightseers hadbeen gathering in the streets keeping carefully to the sidewalkboundaries of the open space
Every eye was turned upon the professor and myself and the sleepingMeigs
The broker was snoring dismally the sound rumbling above thebabble of the wordboxes and echoing through the adjacent thoroughfares
What has happened to the executionergeneral
said to the professor
He isnt very punctual in keeping his engagement with us it seems tome
We have had daylight for an hour
Something has gone wrong Mr Munn Quinn answered taking note of aripple of excitement that ran through the crowds around us
Herecomes the high chief of the military forces
He has his wordbox readyso suppose he is going to explain
The high chief was pushing through the throng into the square two ofhis hands holding wordbox and the other two zetbai
Advancing uponus he halted just without the ring
Be patient gentlemen he said through his talk machine
You willnot be kept waiting much longer
We are not so wildly impatient as you seem to think sent back athim whereupon he tittered little with Key
Seeing that was getting ready to use the same key for fewexpletives the professor made haste to break in
What has happened
he asked
It has just been discovered that there is no white paint in the kingsstorehouse replied the high chief
What is the white paint to be used for
came curiously from theprofessor
The executionergeneral is obliged by law to give himself fresh coatof white paint at every execution
It would be impossible for him toperform his function without first complying with the statute
Could not some one else who has been freshly decorated do the work inhis stead
inquired somewhat flippantly
No answered the high chief
He is the only one in the kingdom whois duly empowered to execute criminals
Our executioner is proudperson and jealous of the prerogatives of his office
He receives noless than two kanos for every happy dispatch that he performs
In thiscase he will be the richer by six kanos so you will understand howanxious he is to have everything done as it should be
kano was the equivalent of half cent of our own money so that ouronetime millionaire Mr Archibald Meigs was to yield up hisvaluable life and help swell the executionergenerals income to theextent of single copper
Had he been awake should have explainedthe matter to him so that he might have still further expatiated uponthe irony of fate
This kingdom of Baigadd differed from the other kingdom with which wehad already made acquaintance in one material respect The surface ofthe country had shrunk much farther from the outer crust of the planet
In Baigol for instance we were always able to see the vault thatcovered us but in Baigadd the sight reached into nothing but emptyspace
Shortly after the high chief had finished speaking there came flourishof wordboxes from the direction of the palace
Turning our eyes towardthat point we beheld two resplendent soldiers in turrets to right andleft of the richly hung balcony
Hail to our munificent sovereign Gaddbai ruler of the realm andmightiest monarch of Njambai
Thus the pæans of the soldiers
The words were echoed by the crowd and surging roar went up from thetalking machines Hail to his majesty King Gaddbai
On the heels of the tumult the kaka draperies parted at the rear of theroyal balcony and the king appeared bowed and seated himself
He had areserved seat for the performance and could see everything that tookplace
Let the executionergeneral stand forth prepare himself for his workand then proceedall in the royal presence
Instantly the master of ceremonies put in an appearance
He wore awhite kirtle carried himself with lordly air and was followed by aretinue of attendants
Two of the attendants bore the official zetbais another carried theofficial wordbox four more were dragging cart on spherical wheelsanopen cart laden with an object that startled us
Great heavens Mr
gasped the professor
Unless my eyes deceiveme the executionergeneral is having my tub of antigravity compoundhauled after him
Your eyes do not deceive you sir made answer
But what in the world are they going to do with it
We shall be able to tell in few moments
The executioner takeshis wordbox and kneels he is about to address the king
Your majesty said the executionergeneral through his talkingmachine your slave craves your indulgence in the matter of preparingfor this happy dispatch
The supply of the official pigment is quiteexhausted and it has been found necessary to fall back upon the whitepaint that was found in the dwelling recently fallen from the top of thecrater
Will it answer the purpose
demanded the king
It is white your majesty and of proper consistency
So far as cansee it will answer the purpose well
Then proceed with your preparations
would have this matter overwith as quick as possible
Of course Quinn and understood all this
knew that the professorwas meditating final appeal to the king and he shot strange look atme as his trembling hands lifted his wordbox
Before the executionergeneral proceeds your majesty remarked theprofessor his fingers none too steady will you allow me word
His majesty gave an exclamation of surprise
Where have you learned our language
he inquired
In Baigol your majesty
We come from that country on visit to youunder the protection of the royal banner of Golbai
The professor nodded to me and shook out the banner and held it aloft
My royal friend said Gaddbai should have been more particular inchoosing the subjects he sends to visit my realm
The sleepingcolossus in the ring with you raided my storehouse and you sought tosave him from capture
For that lawless act death has been decreed toall three of you and the sentence must be carried out
But we were ignorant of the law pleaded the professor
Ignorance of the law is no excuse
The gentleman in the red kirtle is friend of oursIf we know person by the company he keeps that speaks ill for youinterrupted the sovereign
You are determined to have us slain your majesty
It is my royal will
Then shall have to set forces at work to combat the royal will saidthe professor calmly
Cries of consternation and anger went up on every hand
The king rosewrathfully from his seat
You dare to dispute my authority
he demanded
dare to dispute your ability to slay us returned Quinn
Yourexecutioner will disappear from before your eyes if he attempts it
The king laughed ironically
We shall see he said sinking placidly back on his seat
Let theexecutionergeneral proceed with his preparations
was greatly pleased with the drift of affairs
Circumstances hadconspired to favor us and the professor was making the most of hisopportunity
The executionergeneral motioned to one of his attendants and thenraised his four hands above his head
moment later the attendant hadseized the whitewash brush dabbed it into the antigravity compoundand with two quick strokes had covered the executioners chest and back
Had third stroke been needed it could not have been given
In flashthe official had been snatched away vanishing like streak of white inthe void above
The king rose gasping clutching at the balcony rail
The throng aroundus was paralyzed for space and not wordbox was heard
As for Quinn he had struck an attitude his left hand raised aloft andhis glittering beadlike eyes transfixing the king
CHAPTER XIII
THREATENING CALAMITY
And through all this Archibald Meigs slept placidly on
Presently aperfect roar of awe and dismay broke from thousands of wordboxes
Inthe midst of the hubbub the king could be seen waving his hands tocommand silence and attention
The glittering soldiers in the turretssounded clarion warning and silence fell once more
Marvelous are the powers of these colossi
cried the king withtrembling voice
The sleeping thief receives my royal pardon theoffense of his two friends in attempting to succor him is condoned
From now henceforth these three are my honored guests
Let all takeheed
caught the professors hand and gave it fervent clasp
You saved our lives professor said
Hardly he returned smiling
It was the antigravity compound thatdid that
Now that we can inflate our lungs without catching ourbreath suppose we waken Mr
On being aroused Meigs sat up and stared around at him
He was not longin picking up the trend of events where he had left off during thenight
Are they ready toto kill us
he asked clasping his hands
They are not going to kill us Mr Meigs answered the professor
The king has changed his mind and we are now his honored guests
You dont mean it
exclaimed the broker
The professor replied that he did mean it and went on to tell how theunexpected result had been accomplished
Before he had fairly finishedthe king clad in his robes of state and accompanied by dozen membersof his household could be seen approaching across the square
Attendants followed the royal party bearing basins of food chair onwhich his majesty could repose himself and canopy to shield his augustperson from the reflected rays of the sun
The first thing you do Quinn said Meigs while the royal party wasmaking itself comfortable tell the king Ive got to have my clothes
Have patience Mr Meigs answered the professor
spluttered Meigs
Merciful powers man
How can bepatient and cut such figure as this
Attend his majesty
came from wordbox among the kings suite
Ourgracious sovereign is about to speak
Our close attention being secured the king remarkedNow that these colossi have been spared they will need food
See thatit is given them
This command was very satisfactory to me for was little short offamished
Presently our paddles were flying over the basins and wewere breaking our fast in way that made the king open his eyes
The lord of the exchequera most important officer of statedrew nearhis majesty and said that if the kingdom was going to board us for anylength of time it would behoove them to till all the crown lands and getevery available acre into produce
The king made answer that the little man with the beady eyes was awonderworker he had taken care of the executionergeneral with merewave of the hand and no doubt he could with stamp of the footmaterialize as much food as he wanted and whenever he wanted
The lord of the exchequer thereupon retired in much confusion
In the midst of our repast we were startled by voice behind us
Gentlemen gentlemen
Out of your abundant store will you not have thegoodness to give me few mouthfuls of food
Im starving literallystarving
cried Meigs whirling around
exclaimed the professor
The foodtrust magnate was fully clad although his clothing showedsigns of much hard usage
His cheeks were sunken and pale while hiseyes were round and abnormally bright
In his left hand was metalplate and in his right small paddle
Both Meigs and Quinn started toward Markham with the food that stillremained in their basins
The zetring however reared its intangiblebarrier between so that Markham could not so much as touch thereceptacles extended toward him
It was pathetic to watch this onetime master of millions struggling toget the coveted food
He would throw himself at it and recoil tremblingfrom the mysterious force that had shocked and baffled him he wouldsink to his knees or leap in the air trying to reach above or below theinvisible barrier and then he would dissemble slink toward the basinsand make sudden dash as though the strong chemical was an enemy whomhe thought he could take off its guard
At last he gave over and turned away with despairing moan
Meigsfaced the king and began an angry outburst which the professor madehaste to interrupt
Your majesty said Quinn this needy gentleman is also friend ofours
Will you not supply his wants or enable us to do so
The indexograph informed me as to his character answered the kingand it is law of the realm that punishment must fit the crime
Whenyour friend will truly acknowledge himself in the wrong his needs willbe plentifully supplied
Until that time he must beg his food fromhouse to house morsel by morsel
And this other gentleman in the kirtle proceeded the professor willyou not exercise little clemency in his case
have already exercised good deal of clemency the king answerednor can go any further until he also announces change of heart
Markham was as deaf to the wordboxes as was Meigs and his majestyswill was interpreted to them
am not in the wrong
declared Markham
The principle involved is ofvital importance and will die for it if need be
So will averred Meigs
We will eliminate your friends from our calculations for the presentsaid the king
Just now would like to know what has become of myexecutionergeneral
He is pinned to the roof of the underworld said the professor
Can you bring him back
asked the king turning his eye aloft
Really dont see how we are to get along without him
Possibly can return him to you answered the professor
willtry at least providing you will grant request have to make
This dallying with the royal prerogative was not well received by hismajesty nor by those around him
What request would you make in case was inclined to receive it
asked the king
would have you bring out the Bolla and allow these two gentlemen totake it in their hands
The king gave start and look of consternation overspread the facesof those in his retinue
Where did you hear of the Bolla
the king asked sharply
In the other kingdom your majesty the professor replied
The king was silent few moments
We will take that matter up later said he finally
From whence comeyou and your friends
That point has been bothering me for some littletime
We come from another planet which is called the Earth said Quinn
Does the planet you speak of circle around our sun
Yes your majesty
Is it as large as Njambai
Much larger your majesty
And are all the creatures on Earth twohanded as large as you andable to communicate thoughts without wordbox
The inhabitants of Earth are just as you see us
But they do not livebeneath the crust of the planet
The suns rays are so tempered by thetime they reach the Earth that beings are able to live in comfort on theouter shell
The king clapped two of his hands at this and gave other evidence ofhis pleasure on the wordbox
Most wonderful
he exclaimed and launched into series of questionsconcerning the physical attributes of our mother planet and thecharacter and institutions of its people
Quinn answered him fully expatiating on the progress in arts andsciences already made by the Earth dwellers
The kings wonder grewinto awe and admiration
Rising from his chair he paced back and forthin front of us thinking deeply
What sort of weapons have your people
he inquired at last
The professor described our powderandshot machines to the best of hisability
The king was puzzled
Dont they know anything about zet on your native orb
he inquired
No answered the professor
There is no zet in our atmosphere
Suppose company of my soldiers were to land on Earth fully equippedwith zetbais
Could they be resisted
Quinn shuddered
No your majesty they could not be resisted
With your wonderfulzetbais you could conquer and lay waste the entire planet
Candorcompels me to tell you this knowing full well that such result wouldnot be possible to you
Why impossible
cried the king with wild enthusiasm
You and yourfriends must have come hither in that strange house which fell into thecrater
Why could not load company of my soldiers into the houseand go back with you
Then and only then did we see what this crackbrained monarch wasdriving at
Quinn was in trepidation over the outcome
Such thing is not to be thought of
he cried
Your majesty let mebeg you not to give your attention to such quixotic project
am fully resolved
exclaimed the king striding up and down withclinched hands
It is very alluring picture you give me of thisplanet called Earth
Ill conquer it annex it and own it
He halted and raised his wordbox
Ho there Olox
he cried
The high chief stepped forward and made the royal salaam of four hands
We are going forth to conquer the solar system Olox paid the king ina brisk matteroffact way
Yes your majesty answered Olox as readily as though the capturingof planet or two was an everyday occurrence
You have overheard what this strange twohanded creature has beentelling me
went on the king
Yes your majesty
Trains that burn the black blocks and need not be hauled by hand
Green vegetation laughing rivers and babbling brooks all on the outershell
Rich cities stores of art and heaps of yellow gold
These andmyriad other marvelous things are on the Earth Olox and guarded onlyby twohanded fivefingered colossi who have to load tube of ironwith black powder and round missiles before they can attack their foes
The king threw back his head and laughed on the wordbox
Taking cuefrom the king Olox also laughed and so did the others
And these Earth dwellers cant even see in the dark
rippled the kingwith contemptuous fingers
But they are large your majesty ventured the high chief
Large and therefore awkward not quick like our people Olox
Thezetbai is the key to the situation
We could girdle the green star ofthese colossi devastate it and destroy all who sought to oppose us
That is what we shall do
It will be noble campaign your majesty
That is not the word Olox
It will be stupendous
Wellmonopolize everything when we get there my dear sireverything we canget our hands on
And guess we can get our hands on whatever thereiszet will clear every obstacle out of our way
The king looked at the theoretical side
Olox naturally had an eye tothe practical
What are your orders for the campaign your majesty
he asked
shall leave regent to look after Baigadd said the king andmyself accompany the expedition
You will be the military head Olox
Yes your majesty
We are to go in the metal house
It is the only thing we have to go in
The metal house was unhurt byits fall into the crater
That appears to be the case your majesty strange as it may seem
Itfell into the kingdom right side up andThe interior is in good condition
Very good your majesty
My orders to the effect that nothing should be removed from it havebeen carried out
The executionergeneral would have that tub of white pigment
Nothingelse has been taken from the house
Very good
How many of our people will the house contain comfortably
should say that fifty or more could dwell in it without muchinconvenience
Then select fifty soldiers the flower of the Gaddbaizets
Among yourstores be sure you have good supply of black kaka
want some onewho is away up in ideographs to accompany the expedition as historian
It will be attended to your highness
The king turned and aimed his wordbox at the professor
Is that tub of white pigment essential to the proper equipment of themetal house
he asked
Very essential replied Quinn
Three weeks and more in the nether kingdoms had whitened usconsiderably but the professors face was now sickly grayish color
Then will have it taken back to the house said the king
He gave orders to that end at once and the cart was laid hold of anddrawn out of the square and down the street Olox accompanying it
had no idea the king drummed on his wordbox that there were anypeople in the solar system with so much wealth and so little power withwhich to guard it
Ive got the other three kingdoms of Njambai prettywell under my thumb and the regent leave behind to boss things willhave an easy time of it
Quite possibly may conclude not to come backto Njambai
This other star has natural advantages which we do not seemto have here and may prove more comfortable place in which to live
Professor Quinn was shivering like man with an ague
He proceeded touse his talkmachine and the words shook under his unsteady fingers
What you are thinking of your majesty ran the professors words isonly the wildest of dreams
have had dreams before and wild ones the kings wordbox rattledoff complacently and have made them come true
It shall be the samewith this
am conqueror and come of line of conquerors
There are millions upon millions of people on our planet persistedthe professor despairingly
They could hurl these countless numbersagainst you faster than you could slay them with your zetbais
Key of the royal wordbox gave screech of contempt
Suppose we draw line of zet the box added when the derision haddied out imprison groups of those countless numbers and then wipe themout by detachments
How would that work
The atmosphere of Earth is different from that of Mercury continuedthe professor
You cannot draw zet from the air of our planet
Thanks for the hint replied the king
We will take an ample supplywith us and charge the atmosphere with it
Then we shall have storeat hand whenever the need develops
While the king was using his wordbox with two of his hands he wasrubbing the other two together with illconcealed delight
Conditions there are absolutely unknown to you your majestypersisted the professor in frantic endeavor to turn the king from hisdesigns
You will be brought face to face at every turn withsituations that will puzzle you and be fraught with danger
All thenations of the Earth will combine against you
Let them combine
was the monarchs answer
hope they will displaysufficient strength to make the campaign exciting
will capture thisEarth of yours and rule over it
From one end of it to the other willmake it mine
have long felt that Njambai was too small for theproper exercise of my wide abilities
This is your world the professor thumped angrily on his wordboxand you have no right to meddle with any other planet
That caused the king to turn his keen eye on the professor and to keepit there for full minute
have the right to do whatever see fit snapped his talk machine
There is no will in this kingdom but mine and no other will in thefour kingdoms if choose to have it so
But why are you saying suchthings on your wordbox
After firing me with kingly ambition tocapture and annex distant planet why do you proceed to throwdiscouragement in my way
wonder if you have been telling me thetruth
Your majesty hummed the professors talk machine with dignity amnot in the habit of making misstatements
Well find out whether you are or not came from the king
This isan important matter and shall take no mans word for anything
and the wordbox was leveled at some of the retainers bring anindexograph varlets
We will settle this question of veracity here andnow
Some of the retainers scurried away and vanished inside the palace
Presently they reappeared with the indexograph
The professor was backward in facing the teststrangely backward as Ithought for man so clearminded and conscientious
The test is not necessary he demurred
Your actions are far from being open and aboveboard remarked theking
You must submit
The royal eye was on the machine as the professor was tried out
Theideograph told of truthful mind sadly perturbed
The royal wordboxchattered mirthfully
You are afraid can accomplish my purpose
laughed his majesty
Youare worried about your planet
Such state of mind merely enhances mydetermination for you if mistake not are clever man
You wouldnot feel worried if you did not believe could accomplish what havein mind
But be at peace my dear sir
You shall in nowise suffer
Iwill make you ruler of one of the captured kingdoms
This was no lure for the professor
He maintained an attitude ofdignified silence watching the king with steady eyes
wise general went on his majesty always looks over his ground aswell as he may before going out to battle
That will be advisable inthe case of my present campaign
What do you mean by that your majesty
queried the professor
Tonight explained the king again we shall mount to the uppercrust and make reconnoissance of this orb am to subjugate
Have you any astronomical instruments
asked Quinn
None whatever replied the king
Have you
There is an instrument in the steel car which will bring the planetTerra much nearer to us than the naked eye could do
What is it
Describe the instrument to me and will have it broughtout for our nights work
The professor described the telescope and the king dispatched amessenger after Olox in hot haste with supplementary orders
Thereuponthe king bade us farewell and left the square followed by his suite
As stood watching the royal party out of sight heard gurglinggroan behind me
Facing about saw the professor reeling unsteadilythe next moment had caught him in my arms and saved him fall
CHAPTER XIV
PLAN TO STEAL BUILDING
Professor Quinn did not become unconscious
The frightful catastrophethat threatened Terra had preyed upon him at the expense of hisstrength
Easing him to the ground dropped beside him and held hishead on my knee
Cheer up professor said
It surprises me to see you give waylike this
Mr Munn he returned brokenly if this rattlebrained monarch goesout into the universe with picked company of fifty men and hundredzetbais it will mean that the whole solar system will get setback toa period corresponding with our Middle Ages
These creatures of Njambai are far beneath those of Terra incivilization and fate has placed in their hands the terrible zetbai aweapon whose destructive powers are beyond compute
Oh Mr Munn think of our government being overwhelmed by thesefourhanded oneeyed creatures
Think of the wordbox screechingthrough the lofty corridors of the Capitol at Washington where thesoulstirring eloquence of Senators and Representatives has beenthundered amain
Think of theThe professor could give no added touch to the harrowing picture
Throwing his hands to his face he groaned aloud
This hasnt happened yet said
No but it will happen unless we can do something to circumvent the madscheme
Anarchy will reign in our beloved landover the whole earthandI will be held responsible
Ah me
In removing the trust magnates Ihave but paved the way for mightier monopolist
have but followedthe sad example of Frankenstein for out of my plans has sprung amonstrous project that will check progress and hurl civilization backfive hundred years
Dont give up hope said but not very cheerfully for was greatlycast down
Let us pretend to help them
We will lend our aid inmaking the car ready and then at the final moment perhaps we can dartaway and leave them behind or failing in that we may be able to throwthe zetbais from the car while in space
That will pull the fangs of theBaigadds think and they will land on Earth as harmless as lot ofkittens
The professor took heart at this
He would have rallied any way forhis resourceful nature could not struggle long in the slough of despond
Archibald Meigs had been circling around the edge of our barrierseeking for another glimpse of Markham and even calling his name withall his lung power
But the foodtrust magnate neither answered norshowed himself being engaged in housetohouse canvass for thepittance of provender that would keep him alive
Meigs finally turned to us and demanded the cause of the professorsdowncast air
Quinn revealed the kings plot and Meigs tore off into anoutburst of recrimination just as expected he would do
The professor bowed his head meekly to the tempest and even restrainedme when would have put stop to the brokers intemperate language
By and by we had our noon meal and with the attendants who brought itcame Olox seating himself on the ground and watching us as we ate
Thehigh chief was quite amiable and began asking him questions relativeto our surroundings
He indicated the kings private apartments in the palace and pointedout his own residence as well as the dwelling occupied by the lateexecutionergeneral besides vouchsafing other information of interest
What is that small square building under the wing of the palace
That is the imperial exchequer said he
Within that building theking keeps the most priceless of all his treasures
And what is that
inquired the professor
The Bolla was the startling answer
Quinn and exchanged expressive glances
Here through chance remarkby Olox we were suddenly reminded of our duty to the king of Baigol
It was necessary that Olox should not see the startled looks which theprofessor and were exchanging and Mercurial eyes were preternaturallysharp
allowed to come limpingly from the talk instrument
Whatmay that be
stone answered Olox and there was suspicion in his manner in spiteof my attempt to avert it
You already know of the Bolla
Your friendrequested his majesty to have it brought out and at that time you saidthat you had heard of it in the other kingdom
So we did replied trimming my sails to another breeze but whatis it
Our information is rather vague
stone as just said went on Olox
It has beneficial moral andphysical effect on whoever touches it
Where did it come from
It has been in Njambai for ages was the indefinite answer
How did King Gaddbai get hold of it
He borrowed it from the king of Baigol
And yet you call it one of his treasures
If it was borrowed Oloxhow could it possibly belong here
King Gaddbai has taken it was the calm response
What he wants hemakes his own
If King Golbai had not loaned the stone there wouldhave been war
Was that the right thing for your king to do
inquired the professor
Whatever our sovereign does is right
There was no getting around flat statement of that sort
Evidentlythe ruler of the country had drilled his subjects thoroughly
What did you do at the car Olox
said the professor
At the iron house
The professor nodded
Nods and gestures were well understood by the people of Njambai forwith four hands they were well equipped for finger and whole armmovements
The kings orders were carried out at the iron house finished Olox
The paint was returned to its proper place
Even so
And the telescopeThat matter was attended to
trust you handled the telescope with care
It is exceedingly fragileand could be easily injured
After the king spoke as he did death by zet would be meted out to theone who injured the instrument
There were several things wanted to ask Olox and the principal onehad to do with Gilhooly and the way he had been taken from the car andmade to serve the traction interests of the kingdom
However theprofessor was keeping Olox so busy with his wordbox that my ownquestions were crowded out
The family of the executionergeneral are anxious to have himreturned remarked Olox while the professor was looking for the properkey on which to formulate his next question
Could that beaccomplished
It might replied the professor guardedly
What has become of him
He disappeared as he was about to commit deed of base injusticesaid the professor grimly
We are aware of that and Olox looked uneasily around as he punchedthe words but we are ignorant of the cause of his disappearance
He isa distant relative of mine and promised his next of kin to put thesequestions to you
Is he alive
Olox pressed closer and muffled his wordbox so that the sounds couldnot carry to dangerous limits
If you would tell us how to proceed in the matter of getting theexecutionergeneral back he whispered can promise you and yourfriends help in getting out of the country
Look out for the indexograph Olox said
If they should happen togive you try out with it the ideograph wouldnt look well to theking
Olox was greatly shakenso shaken in fact that he could not pursue thesubject further
will talk with you later about the executionergeneral he finishednoting the empty dishes before the professor and Meigs and me and thecurious manner of those who had come with him
Until then prayconsider that nothing has been said on the subject
With that hearose and beckoned to his companions
After Olox had led the attendants away with the empty food receptaclesthe professor and got our heads together on the mission that hadbrought us to Baigadd
We did not think it necessary or advisable to let Meigs know of ourpurpose in regaining control of the Bolla
We are pledged to secure the mysterious stone if we can Mr Munnsaid Quinn
Undoubtedly the work will put us in bad odor here and mayinterfere with our attempt to balk the king in his comprehensive schemeof conquest but that does not release us from the task in question
tingle of gratification shot along my nerves
The feeling ofoppression that had burdened me was lifted for ever loved to crack aprofessional nut and here was one that would certainly try me to theutmost
surveyed the small building with critical eyes
Here is where my inches get the better of me professor said
Forone of my size to get into that house is out of the question
And Iwouldnt know where to lay hands on the Bolla if it were physicallypossible for me to effect an entrance
can make suggestion Mr Munn said Quinn which would get yousafely around that difficulty
What is that
inclined my ear to his lips
Why not run away with theimperial exchequer
Steal it bodily mean
When you get to Baigol with it let the kingeffect entrance secure his Bolla and then you return the exchequer toits original location
Of course it would be very wrong to steal thekings treasury and would not counsel that under any consideration
You merely borrow it to obtain the Bolla the stone returned to itsrightful owners you return the exchequer
And get zetbaied for my pains
Let us hope said the professor that before you can get zetbaied weshall be in position to use the car and escape from the planet
gave much thought to the matter
It is long chance returned frankly but have been taking longchances ever since became cracksman
will put the plan inoperation professor at the very first opportunity that presentsitself
Thus we left the matter the professor warmly congratulating me on mycourage and expressing the hope that would prove equally courageous inmore worthy pursuits if the chance ever offered
CHAPTER XV
SURVEYING OUR OWN PLANET
Day slipped along to its close and shortly after the reflectors winkedout the king came accompanied by Olox guard of Gaddbaizets and sixattendants bearing the telescope
To our surprise and gratification both Markham and Popham were in themidst of the royal guard
It struck me said the king graciously that your friends might alsowish to view the orb from which they came
It is little thing and canbe done without inconvenience so am pleased to favor them
The high chief traced an opening in the zet ring with the black tip ofhis weapon and Meigs was first to rush through and hurl himself intothe arms of Popham
The unfortunate gentlemen were long in each othersembrace
When they finally drew apart Meigs groped through the black gloom byMarkham while the professor felt for the coal barons hand and gave ita gentle and reassuring pressure
Professor Quinn said Popham am being badly treated
The king hasput me on the night shift in one of the royal coal mines and thesoldiers make me work like galley slave
This is the first night Ihave had off since they set me to work
Popham was loud in his complainings but was cut short by the king
We must proceed gentlemen
have word from above that the night isfine and everything propitious for an excellent view of your planet butstorms come suddenly and we can never be sure of the weather on theouter crust
It is well to make haste
We started stumblingly each of us led by soldier to whom the way wasplain
We were jostled here and there through the gloom and finallywere made to mount some object which gave metallic ring beneath ourfeet
This is the royal lift explained the king
When the heat of the dayis suspended often go above
He then addressed himself to Olox
Give the signal at once
The signal was given and we shot aloft
The transformation from thefury of storm to the light and tranquillity of the underworld had beengreat and astounding but this second transformation was none the lessimpressive
We emerged into wonderful night set with stars that were perfectlyfamiliar to me
The Dipper and Polaris were in the north and occupyingrelatively the same positions that they do when viewed from Earthsolittle effect has the immensities of distance upon their posts in thevault
But our own globe
It hung huge and tremulous in the blue of theevening sky so plain that we could almost note the continents thatgemmed its surface
Meigs gave whimpering cry and he and Markham and Popham rushedtogether fell upon each others neck and wept aloud
Oh wish was back wish was back
moaned the broker
Im lonesome enough to die
sobbed Markham
Exiled exiled exiled
was all the coal baron could murmur in huskytones
will not say that was proof against the sentiments that had unmannedthe onetime magnates but will declare that both Quinn and myself hadour feelings under better control
In silence assisted the professorto plant the telescope and we each gazed longingly at the greenish starmagnified to many times its diameter
Theres the United States
cried Popham
Can you see New York
whispered Meigs hoarsely
Look for New Yorkman
Of course view of New York was out of the question but the franticexplutocrats imagined they could see it and even look down into WallStreet for aught know
Again were their emotions too much for themand they gave way as they had done before
Mr Munn said the professor this is harrowing
It is pretty hard on those gentlemen returned to be brought faceto face with something they thought they owned and yet not be able topossess it
That remark is unlike you answered the professor and turned to theking
thought occurred to me while we were coming up on the lifthe went on and should like you to explain
If it is in my power
answered the king his eye to the telescope
When we dropped into the kingdom of Baigol there was storm on thesurface of this planet
That storm must have hidden the sun and yetthe reflectors below were sending day throughout the realm
The reflection came from other and smaller reflectors arranged to takecare of just such an emergency explained the king
Storms are onlylocal you know and when one gathers over the giant reflector thesmaller ones at the other points are brought into use
But lets nottalk of this planet but of that other one up here
And along that line the kings conversation ran for full hour
At last when we were ready to descend so far from being dismayed bythe enormity of the task before him the royal zealot was fortified inhis resolution to carry it out
His majesty was in great good humor and when we had left the lift andmarched back to the square he very graciously tendered us the freedom ofthe town
He could not understand why the professor and should have any desireto escape from his country and inasmuch as he had made us his honoredguests to return us to the circle of zet would be to besmirch hishospitality
The zet had been regathered into the high chiefs zetbai and it was notagain released
It was not necessary for Popham to return to the royalmines until the following night so he remained with us along withMarkham and we all bunked down in the centre of the plaza
Is there no way Professor Quinn quavered Popham whereby we canescape from the inhuman monsters who people this planet
The treatmentI have suffered is monstrous
feel as though shall die if have togo back to those royal coal mines again
Being large man they expectme to do the work of dozen Mercurials
There are blisters on my handsand my feet are so sore can hardly walk
This wail from the brusque and tyrannical Popham was in itself highlyedifying comment on his sad experiences
Your position was grace itself compared with mine mourned Markham
These people seemed determined to starve me to death
am expected totravel from house to house begging food and they hardly give me enoughat one house to take me to the next
You are on the surface returned Popham and you are not delvingcontinually in the hot unhealthy regions where must do my work
Ihave to toil like galley slave for cent day and cents worth ofthis vegetable food which seems to be all they have here does notfurnish me with enough strength for my labor
You have your clothes at least whimpered Meigs
Quinn ought tohelp us he must help us
shall do what can gentlemen said the professor wearily
havenot succeeded in showing you the error of your ways but must let thatpass
greater calamity menaces our planet than any you could possiblylet loose upon our devoted country
Meigs was saying something about that spoke up Popham
What is itthis mad king thinks of doing
Why with fifty warriors armed with zetbais he intends making anattack upon Terra
He hopes to conquer our mother orb
Popham gave faint cry of derision
Why if that rascal ever landed on our planet said he he and hiswarriors would be captured out of hand and turned over to some museumfor exhibition purposes
If happened to be around at the time oftheir capture he finished angrily would send every last one ofthem into mines that are mines
Id make them toil with their fourhands until they wore them off at the wrists
Gad but that would be arevenge worth having
This is not time to think of revenge Mr Popham spoke up theprofessor more in sorrow than rebuke
We have our planet to considerand next to the planet ourselves
Our planet is big enough to take care of itself averred Markham
Leave that out of the question professor and confine your attentionto some way in which we can better our condition
The danger that threatens Earth is greater than you appear to imaginewent on Quinn
For whatever happened to our homestar because of KingGaddbai and his astounding plans of conquest should be responsible
The thought weighs upon me and will give me no rest
The king must befoiled
How does he intend to reach the Earth
asked Markham
By means of our car
Is that in usable condition
came joyously from Popham
So far as can discover it lies intact at the bottom of the crater onwhose rim we landed
There is no reason why the car cannot be employedfor return to Terra but and here the professors words becameemphatic it shall not be so employed by King Gaddbai and his army ofconquest
shall prevent that at all hazards
came hoarsely from the three exmillionaires
By destroying the car as last resort and when other means fail wasthe calm rejoinder
You would not dare
breathed Popham
You would not have the heart to take from us our sole means of escape
added Markham
ground out Meigs
If really thought that you would destroyour only means of salvation IdYou wouldnt do thing Meigs chimed in
Whatever the professorthinks best to do is going to be done and no two ways about it
dont want to destroy the car continued the professor unmoved bythis storm he had aroused if other means can be made to serve
And Imay say that we shall exhaust every effort to make other means serve
Ifeel that it is my duty to return you gentlemen to the place from whenceyou were taken
have not accomplished what had hoped to do but itis better to be disappointed in that rather than to let King Gaddbai getaway in the car with his fifty warriors
Certainly it is your duty to send us back said Meigs and you shouldconsider that duty before anything and everything else
seconded Popham and we must take Gilhooly with us
If onegoes all must go
Leave the matter to me gentlemen counseled the professor quietly
shall do everything possible
The coal baron and the foodtrust magnate continued to dwell upon theirharrowing experiences with various degrees of intensity until commandfor silence came from wordbox somewhere around us
Our raucous toneswere keeping the people awake all over the city the talking machineaverred and unless we became instantly quiet the authorities would takethe matter in hand
This threat had the desired result
We gave over our conversation andsettled ourselves for the night
do not know how long slept but it must have been some hours
wasaroused to find it still dark and to behold the professor with lightedmatch in one hand and his other hand over my lips
The burning match threw fitful glare around the open space and evenreached to the roof tops beyond
Both the palace and the imperialexchequer were brought shadowily forth out of the gloom
Now is the time Mr
whispered the professor
The time
returned sotto voce
Time for what
Without word he pointed to the square building under the wing of thepalace
It was now or never if intended to make my raidand secure the Bolla
started erect
You have matches Mr
the professor asked in the very faintestof audible tones
You must be very careful to keep to the street until you reach thecountry the professor went on
If you should make misstep andwreck block of houses the disaster would be irretrievable
will strike matches and light my way until get well into thehills said
Just what should have suggested said he
Goodby Mr Munn
Failnot to return with the exchequer as soon as the king of Baigol hassecured the Bolla
Meantime shall hope to get the car in readiness tospeed our departure
We struck hands as men will when confronted by an issue of life anddeath
Then stepped into the street bent over the imperialexchequer and wrenched it from its foundations
It was wellconstructed building and although its contents jingledlike rattle box when took it under my arm it did not give way inany part
Striking match on the roof of the exchequer lighted my way down thestreet picking my steps with care and caution
CHAPTER XVI
HOW ILLLUCK OVERTOOK ME
Good fortune fared forth with me from the royal city and remainedsteadfastly at my right hand as long as the matches lasted but when thelast one had flickered out and left me in impenetrable gloom mytroubles began
was well into the rough country when the lights failed threading aroad bordered by hills that in some places were shoulder high
Aboutthe first thing did was to blunder off the trail in trying to regainit stumbled over fivefoot mountain and went down all of heap
Had fallen on the exchequer should have smashed it into cockedhata result only narrowly averted
Regaining my feet and smotheringsome good strong language that rose instinctively to my lips essayedonce more to find the Baigol road
had my trouble for my pains and after an hour spent in fruitlessblundering sat down on cliff propped up the exchequer on the sideof cañon and nursed my barked shins until day began flashing from thereflectors
As sat there waiting for the light my brain was filled with evilthoughts which recall with contrition and chronicle with regret
Iknew the exchequer must contain the kings wealthgolden pieces of eightof rare fineness unknown to the mints of Terra
was not of mind to return the gold after allowing the king of Baigolto take his Bolla
Why not stow the treasure away about my clothes andrely upon my native tact and discretion to get me to the steel car inspite of the grasping monarch of Baigadd
was much wrought up over the way had lost the loot taken from theplutocrats
In my minds eye could see those four bulginghandkerchiefs waxing and waning about the castle and had hoped theywould fall to the surface of Mercury along with the car so that mightstill be able to secure them
In this was disappointed
Once the Mercurial atmosphere was struckthe loot and the revolver had fallen away from the castle like so manypieces of lead
The wallets undoubtedly had been incinerated by the suns raystogether with the banknotes that were in them
imagined that theintense heat had exploded the cartridges in the sixshooter and hadwarped and twisted the firearm until it was no longer serviceable
The other plunder also even if found could not by any possibility beutilized by me or any one else
All this had made me savagely eager to recoup my finances
And as satbrooding on the cliff asked myself why should not do this at theexpense of the Baigadd exchequer
did not arouse myself at the first reflected flash of day
Although Ihad decided to appropriate the contents of Gaddbais coffers wascasting about for suitable method that would gain my end with theleast inconvenience
maudlin chuckle from near at hand brought me abruptly out of myreflections
turned and there on neighboring elevation stoodGilhooly balancing the exchequer on the broad of his hand
was brought up staring
What could the motive power of the BB
Interplanetary be doing there at that time
His absence must haveinterfered sadly with the train schedule
Certainly the officers of thesystem would not have countenanced this neglect of duty had they knownof it
Then it flashed over me that Gilhooly had run away
He had tired ofracing up and down the Vshaped groove with string of toy cars and hadtaken French leave of the system
The fire of insanity was still in his eyes and he retreated step bystep as advanced upon him
Look here Gilhooly said in my most persuasive tones thatbuilding you have in your hands is the imperial exchequer
Put it downtheres good fellow
Dont juggle with it in that way
Suppose youwere to drop it
Gilhooly had begun shaking it up and down as though it were one of thosecastiron banks in which children sometimes deposit their coppers Thejingle of the exchequers contents appeared to please him
If you want this road you have got to bid up for it said he
Imnot so young that dont know good thing when Ive got it in mygrip
That road has gone into the hands of receiver returned humoringhis fancy and Im the receiver
Give it here Gilhooly
was not consulted when the receiver was appointed he answered
Ihave rights in the matter and those rights must be protected
Its adeal framed up to beat the pool
My how it rattles
and he shook theexchequer again
was at my wits end
knew that tact was far and away more effectivethan violence when dealing with crazed person
Put it down for moment Gilhooly wheedled and come over to thedirectors meeting
Who are the directors
he asked suspiciously
Well there are only two
Im one you know and youre the other
He exploded laugh tossed the exchequer in the air like strong manplaying with cannon ball and then caught it deftly as it came down
Im the boy to juggle with railroads
he boasted
Ask any one in theStreet and theyll tell you
Look out
gasped or youll drop it
he mumbled
never yet wrecked railroad
Where did you come from Gilhooly
asked seeking to get him intoconversation while edged closer to him by degrees
From distant parts he replied
Ive been the whole thing for bigtranscontinental line that Im adding to the Gilhooly System
Hechuckled craftily
They thought they had me but got out from underwith the rolling stock
Ive hid the cars in gully and my next movewill be to steal the right of way
Im the big railroad man of thecountry
Just ask anybody who knows whats what in transportationcircles and theyll tell you the same thing
had arrived within few feet of him and suddenly leaped forward
But he was wary and sprang aside the exchequer jingling sharply
No you dont said he
Youre trying to serve subpoena on me andIm too foxy for you
Get out of here or Ill have you throwndownstairs
Come over to the directors meeting Gilhooly urged turning andwalking away from him
Youve got to look after your interests youknow
But the vagaries of shattered mind are hard to deal with
Gilhoolylaughed at me sat down on rock and took the exchequer on his knees
He was wary and never for an instant permitted me to lose his eyes
You cant fool me he cried so youd better take the next train forhome
hold majority of the stock and after Ive watered it alittle Ill have enough to buy another line
Its easy being railroadmagnate when you know how
Clear out you annoy me
Gilhooly said with gentleness was far from feeling dont youwant to know something about Popham
Dont know him snarled Gilhooly but if hes trying to break intothis railroad game just tell him that control the whole bag of tricksand that its not worth his while
Hugging the exchequer in his arms he rocked back and forth and began tosing
Well said starting away again if you dont want to attend thisdirectors meeting Ill have to look after it myself
He made no reply but kept on hugging the exchequer rocking back andforth and timing his monotonous croon to the rattle of treasure in thekings strong rooms
Warily as could circled about creeping on all fours and screeningmyself by the little hills and ridges
My design was to come up onGilhooly from behind and snatch the exchequer away from him
But he heard me
Before had come within dozen feet of him hestopped his singing leaped to his feet and whirled around
The nextmoment he had placed himself at safe distance
Im too many for you he shouted
Go away or Ill call the police
was in sweat for fear some of King Gaddbais soldiers would locateus and develop their zetbais
One flash of that violet fire would dothe business for both Gilhooly and me and the professors cherishedplans would go by the board
Besides had plans of my own and itseemed as though Gilhooly was destined to make mess of everything
Oh come now cried in bit of temper
That wont do you anygood Gilhooly
It doesnt belong to you and you havent any right tokeep it
Dont we ever keep anything that dont belong to us
he askedsarcastically
Im not that sort of fellow for keep everything inthe railroad line that can get my hands on
Logic and reason were utterly dead in his mind
Whims he had but theywere but fancies of the moment
As stood there looking at him Iwondered how the people of Baigadd had ever managed to keep him haulingtheir trains as long as they had
Goodby he called suddenly taking the exchequer under his arm
Ithink Ill go to the office andJust then made dash at him
With mocking laugh he whirled aboutand raced off across the hills myself in hot pursuit
Gilhoolys course intersected the Baigol highway and he turned into itroaring defiantly as he sped along
Suddenly he stumbled and fell anda cry of dismay escaped me
He had fallen squarely on the exchequer and wrecked it completely
Kyzicksyellow coins the size of gold dollar and worth five times asmuchrolled everywhere about the road diverging from heap that layrevealed by the collapsed walls of the building
Flinging forward Iwent to my knees and began plunging my hands into the pile
believe that just then was as daft as Gilhooly himself
In thosedays the glimmer of gold always had demoralizing effect on me
As raked my outspread fingers through the yellow pile brought up around jetblack stone the size of my fist
regarded it as bit ofchaff in the bin of wealth and hurled it from me down the road
With aloud yell Gilhooly leaped after it
Then became aware of weird and inexplicable feeling that laid itselflike an axe at the root of my professional instinct
What right had Ito all this treasure
It belonged to the king of Baigall he was anunworthy creature perhaps but still it belonged to him
What had Ibeen about to do
My heart sickened and sprang up spurned thekyzicks with my heel and turned my back
That was my awakening
In one instant the iron of repentance hadpierced my soul
The past rolled its turgid waters in front of me
Ishivered and drew back from that wave of evil covering my eyes to blotit from my sight
How should atone for the days that had been
Could do it by anunflinching rectitude in the days there were to be
Conscience wasbelaboring me with telling blows
had not been on intimate terms withmy conscience for many years and to have it thus suddenly overmaster meand drive me into reformation was mystery beyond my power to explain
While stood there consumed with regret and hoping against hope for thefuture voice hailed me from down the road
Did you say your name was Munn
Could that calm contained voice have come from Emmet Gilhooly
Ilooked in his direction and found him leaning against jutting spur ofrocks his right hand clutching convulsively the black stone had flungfrom me
The crazed light had vanished from his eyes
An expression of wonder wason his face but it was rational wonder developed by an awakening asabrupt and complete as mine had been
You have it right Mr Gilhooly answered the extreme mildness ofmy voice surprising me
My full name is James Peter Munn andYou are the thief who just came into the castle and relieved myself andmy friends of their valuables
Gilhoolys normal condition had come back to him at the point where ithad been dropped
was not slow in reasoning how this might be
was thief in the letter and spirit less than ten minutes back Ihumbly answered but now sir have turned leaf
promise youthat the rest of the book shall read better than what has gone before
Gilhooly passed his left hand across his forehead
Wherewhere am
he faltered
In the kingdom of Baigadd returned some distance out of the royalcity
Royal city
You talk strangely Mr Munn
Where is thecastle
Where are Meigs Markham and Popham
And Professor Quinn
Are wehe started forward and looked wildly aroundstill in thecastle
But no that cant be
You just said we were somewhere else
beg your pardon Mr Munn
am confused and hardly know what amsaying
began an explanation going patiently into every detail and when Ifinally finished Gilhooly knew as much about our situation as did
For some time Gilhooly walked up and down the road passing andrepassing the heap of gold
At last he paused beside it
We should return this treasure to its owner Mr Munn said he and hedropped the black stone on the yellow pile
From what you tell methis is strange planet and strangely peopled
Yet there issuperstition here as well as in our native orbas these wonder talesabout the Bolla will bear evidence
think with you sir said
The Bolla is simply fetish and itsmiraculous powers are purely imaginary
That is the sensible way to look at it
Suppose we load our pocketswith the gold and start back with it to the city from whence it wastaken
assented and suggested using our coats as improvised bags for theeasier transportation of the kings wealth and we stripped to our shirtsleeves and set about our work
In half an hour we had collected allthe scattered treasure had bound it up in our coats and had startedback
Gilhooly preserved pensive silence
His thoughts were far away and heseemed entirely oblivious of the fact that was trudging along at hisside
It was only when we turned an angle in the road and came face toface with Quinn Meigs Markham and Popham that Gilhooly showed anyinterest in our present situation
CHAPTER XVII
CHANGE OF HEART
The meeting between Gilhooly and his brother exiles was most affecting
In the general joy at finding the exrailway magnate restored to reasonthe matter of the imperial exchequer was temporarily lost sight of
And think the man who rejoiced most over Gilhoolys returned sanitywas Quinn
The professors beady little eyes were fairly glowing as hecaught and clung to Gilhoolys hand after the others had expressed theirpleasure and tendered congratulations
This is glad day for me Mr
exclaimed the professor
Ihad taken myself very much to task on account of your clouded mind
Your reproach of yourself was well merited spoke up Meigs who alwayshad venomous shaft in his quiver for Quinn
Small thanks to you thatour friend is himself again
Gently Mr Meigs gently came from Gilhooly
do not findProfessor Quinn in the wrong in any particular
Popham Meigs and Markham regarded Gilhooly with openmouthed amaze
Ithink the professor also was startled know at least that was
Do you mean to say Mr Gilhooly cried Meigs that you can overlookQuinns criminal folly in casting us adrift in the unknown
cannot only overlook it was the quiet response but can forgiveit
Almost am of the opinion that it was justifiable
rasped Meigs
You have not recovered your reason after all oryou would not talk that way
Let us not engage in useless disputes gentlemen put in theprofessor
There is another affair to engage us
It was thoughtQuinn went on with an expressive look at me that Mr Gilhooly hadfled the realm and taken the imperial exchequer with him
It was who took the exchequer said and it is who hope toreturn it to the king
What about the Bolla
queried Quinn giving me sharp look
It is here said touching the makeshift bundle was carrying undermy arm
At least added there is strange looking black stoneamong the gold coins and suppose it must be King Golbais palladium
We were sent forth to look for Mr Gilhooly and the stolen treasureremarked the professor
Olox and his Gaddbaizets are likewise on theroad but we have been able to leave them pretty well in the rear
What was thought of my absence
Very little Mr Munn
Every officer of the state seemed united infixing the blame upon Mr Gilhooly
Since he was known to be mentallyunsound no crime could be attached to his act
shall tell the truth of it declared
And be condemned to death by zet said the professor gazing at mefixedly
Let the king believe what he will said Gilhooly
should ratherhave it so since it means so much to Mr
Why did you not keep on to the other kingdom with the Bolla
inquiredQuinn of me
Because didnt think should be doing the right thing replied
And why this sudden change in your sentiments Mr
cant explain it professor
believe it is theory of yours that one thief has the right to takefrom another what does not belong to either of them
Two wrongs do not make right
The change in your sentiments is most suddenand remarkable
Will you please untie the sleeves of your coat and allow me to have alook at that black stone
lowered my bundle and opened it
There said but poorly concealing the contempt felt for the blackstone as pointed to it
You may take stock in the superstition ifyou will professor but will have none of it
The professor gave me queer smile then picked up the Bolla andsurveyed it curiously
Would you like to look at it Mr
he asked
fetish like this is sure sign of barbarism observed Meigs takingthe stone
The creatures who inhabit this planet are not of veryhigh order mentally
He passed the Bolla to Popham and Popham handed it to Markham
It waspresently returned to me and packed it away as before
The professor then asked me for an account of what had happened duringmy flight toward Baigol with the exchequer
Gilhooly was not able tohelp me much in the recital as the most important part of ouradventures was perfect blank to him
did not try to conceal anything from Quinn
painted my designs onthe kings money as black as they really were and he smiled as helistened
When did Mr Gilhooly lay hands on the Bolla
Quinn asked
How do you know that he did
am very sure that he did was the quiet reply
Thereupon told the professor how had thrown the stone from the heapof gold and Gilhooly had picked it up his reason returning shortlyafterward
Quinn wagged his head sagely and mumbled something couldnot understand but which had to do with the ridiculous pretensions ofthe Bolla
feared then for the mind of this great and good man
Was he breakingunder the tremendous responsibility incurred by removing the plutocratsfrom Earth
chill of apprehension shot to my heart
was about to say somethingof soothing nature to my patronfor certainly looked upon him assuchwhen Olox and his Gaddbaizets appeared
Key seven of the high chiefs wordbox titillated with relief theinstant the officer got his eye on Gilhooly
The exuberance faded intoa note of foreboding and the foreboding into the wordsWhere is the kings treasure house
If that has not been recoveredcalamity threatens our expedition to the planet Terra
The treasure house has been broken and wrecked replied the professorbut my friends Mr Gilhooly and Mr Munn are returning the gold tohis majesty in their coats
Why should Mr Gilhooly steal the gold and then help to return it
came incredulously from Olox
Is it simply vagary of his unbalancedmind
am pleased to say Chief Olox that his mind is no longerunbalanced returned the professor warning me to silence with lookas was about to operate my talking machine
Mr Gilhooly is now assane as you or
Olox looked worried
declare said he dont know how the president and board ofdirectors of the Interplanetary will regard this unexpected occurrence
They should feel overjoyed at the unclouding of so bright mind as Mr
But what if it interferes with the traffic of the road
They have beenrunning limited trains on schedule heretofore beyond their wildestdreams
His majesty farmed out the concession to the management of theroad for ninetynine years on cash basis
If the traction powerproves unavailable demand will be made on the king for return ofthe moneyand just now any depletion of the imperial coffers might provefatal to the projected expedition
It was just as well that the exmagnates could not comprehend what wasgoing on between the wordboxes
The utilitarian views of the king asexemplified in Gilhoolys case would have jarred somewhat on theirconceit and selfesteem
noticed that gleam of hope crossed Quinns face when Olox spoke of apossible failure of the kings plan of conquest through lack of thesinews of war
But the hope died away almost instantly when Quinnreflected as did that the monarch was as unscrupulous as he wasresourceful
No further conversation was indulged in
The royal troops executed anabout face and returned to the capital convoying our reunited party ofaliens
As we drew up in the square the two glittering soldiers appeared in theturrets and sounded call that drew the king to the balcony
His majesty listened to the report of Olox with beaming face but hissmiles fled when he learned how the traction interests of the realm werethreatened by Gilhoolys returning sanity
While this momentous question was still up for debate Meigs plucked atthe professors sleeve
Tell the king professor said he his eyes downcast that see theerror of my way and frankly acknowledge it
If am ever so fortunateas to get back to Earth shall be reformer
Please ask the king whenI can have my clothes
And this was Meigs
Had the heavens fallen could not have been moreastounded
Tell him the same for me spoke Hannibal Markham
Make it evenstronger if you will
have not been starved into submissionI shouldhave withstood such siege to the deathbut the change has been wroughthere
He struck hand against his heart
And ask him professor added Markham plaintively to have my wantssupplied immediately from the palace kitchens
Allow me to join my honorable friends in this free announcement of achange of heart chimed in Augustus Popham
Look at my hands
He held his hands out to us and we found them calloused and scarred
cant go back to those mole burrows
he supplemented
Professor Quinn showed no signs of amazement
After grasping the palm ofeach exmagnate he fairly electrified his wordbox with thesupplications of the exiles
Are these acknowledgments freely made and do they come from contritehearts said the king or do they merely cloak desire to escapefurther privation at the expense of truth
The professor indignantly repelled the insinuation
When he hadfinished his vigorous remarks stepped to the front and made acomplete confession of my designs on the Bolla and the imperialexchequer
Quinn tried to stop me but would suffer no interference
Are you aware said the king gravely that lèse majesté felonyand half dozen other capital crimes are mixed up in your confession
Am less courageous than an extrust magnate
cried warmly
Their confessions free them from servitude and the inconveniences ofhunger and lack of raiment responded the king yours condemns you toa blast of zet that will consume and dissipate your body as though ithad never been
Professor Quinn groaned and turned away with one hand over his eyes
Myaffection reached out for the good man then as it had never done before
Bring on the indexograph Olox commanded the king
We will see howmuch of truth or falsehood it registers in the cases of thesegentlemen
The indexograph was brought and test was made of all of us except theprofessor
The ideographs must have registered mightily in our favorfor the king seemed more than convinced of our sincerity
Restore to the clothing trust man the apparel that is rightfully hisordered his majesty allow the gentleman who would monopolize food topartake of sufficient supply to satisfy his hunger free the personwho has been delving for my black blocks from further dutyandincidentally confiscate the funds paid into the royal treasury for hisservices as well as for the services of the BB
traction powerforMr Gilhoolys sanity precludes his further use on the Interplanetary
Be happy gentlemen
feel that must do some worthy deeds tocommemorate this the day that witnesses our departure for thesubjugation of Terra
Quinn was rent with conflicting emotions as was plainly apparent
Hewas glad the explutocrats had fallen into royal favor he was sorry tohave me yet under that ban and he was greatly wrought up to learn thatthe king meditated such an early start on his interstellar campaign
What of Mr Munn your highness
he inquired
Oh yes returned the king was forgetting him
Olox let him bedecorated with the Order of the Open Hand and see that he is inducted onthe morrow into the office of executionergeneral
We need anexecutioner to fill the place of the late incumbent and should have tolook far before found so conscientious person as Mr Munn
Leaveorders with subordinate Olox
Neither you nor will be here toattend the ceremony
My royal will shall be conveyed to the regent
And now added the king as he rose from his seat while the treasurercounts the kyicks and takes care of the Bolla Olox you and willproceed to the metal house guarded by the Gaddbaizets and accompaniedby our alien friends
Some preparations were necessary before start for the car could bemade and while these were going forward Meigs and Markham were led awayto receive the attention their condition demanded
In an hour we were on the road
Meigs and Markham were in jubilantmood Popham was optimistic but subdued Gilhooly was silent andthoughtful and was inclined to look at the future with recklessindifference
But Professor Quinn was bowed under grievous load
If this madcapmonarch carried out his scheme of conquest Quinn felt that on him alonewould rest the responsibility
am making my plans Mr Munn he whispered hoarsely to me as weproceeded on our journey to the car
If the kings expedition getsaway shall have to accompany it and shall take care that neitherhe nor his Gaddbaizets ever reach our native planet
But suppose we can outwit the king in some way returned andescape in the car leaving him and his subjects behind
You and our other friends may go if we can possibly manage it saidQuinn but have made up my mind to stay here
stopped short and stared at him
Surely you cant mean that
do mean it he said firmly
For the good of Terra these creaturesof Njambai must be watched
We have only surface knowledge of themand their resources
What if they should bring forward other means ofspanning space besides our car
Cant you see the professor went on passionately that my misguidedenthusiasm painted the wonders of Earth in such glowing colors that KingGaddbai will strain every effort to gratify his cupidity and lust forconquest
must remain here to combat him and hold him in check
Sir said in trepidation think you take fright too easily
Oncewe leave Njambai in the car it will be impossible for any of theBaigadds to follow us
You overestimate their possible resources
Whatever is possible cannot be overestimated
It may chance that Ialone shall stand between this resolute monarch and the welfare andhappiness of Terra
To desert my post would be cowardice
Do not seekto argue with me for made up my mind to this last night
The reckless indifference with which had fared forth from the citygave place to deep sorrow
Professor Quinn observed this and continuedDo not exercise yourself over my fate Mr Munn
removed four rabidenemies of the people from our planet and give back to it four eminentreformers
My end has been accomplished beyond my fondest dreams ifthis is brought to pass
And then too there is work that can do here even if my direimaginings prove unfounded
can after know these Mercurialsbetter lead them perhaps to higher round in the ladder ofcivilization
With the pattern of our earthly institutions before myeyes can choose the good eliminate the evil and build fabric herethat will be glory to whatever resources the orb may possess
Is itnot fair destiny for one who was laughed out of the AstronomicalSociety because he dared to have convictions as did
It is destiny professor said which intend to share with you
You remain here and so do
Possibly you may become prime minister Iwill be executionergeneral
Between us we will have control of thesituation
That is not to be thought of answered the professor hastily
If itis possible for the exiles to escape in the car you must accompany themas the one coolheaded resourceful man capable of guiding the car toits destination
shall instruct you carefully and fully
And besides he added as was about to demur you are changedman Mr Munn
There is work for you on the home planet for your nativeworth is to retrieve itself on the very scene of your unworthy exploits
trust you follow me
Pardon me if hurt your feelings by being toofrank
He had wittingly or unwittingly touched the vital chord which made meeager to regain the world knew and loved
To stand fair in the sightof men who had known me at my worst was now my one consuming desire
Is this your wish Professor Quinn
asked huskily
It is Mr
Then shall follow your instructions to the letter
Do so he said with one of his rare smiles
And if our dear desirescompass fulfillment open this packet when you have left Njambai and arein the great void
It will be my last word to you and your fellowvoyagers in space
He handed sealed packet to me and placed it carefully in my breastpocket
Then handclasp followed in which heart went out to heart asit rarely does between man and man
Look Mr
exclaimed the professor releasing my palm
We havereached the car
CHAPTER XVIII
HOW WE OUTWITTED THE KING
We had come to point in the underworld which the reflected rays ofthe sun reached but dimly
There would have been semigloom but for anunreflected glow that fell upon us from above
The car as has been brought out in the course of this narrative hadbeen blown into the crater of dead volcano
This crater may belikened to deep basin pierced with huge hole at the bottom
Through the hole fell daylight from the outer shell bathing the car ina soft radiance
The projectileshaped house was standing upright andappeared to have suffered no injury by its fall
Professor Quinn had already explained to me how this might be possible
The screens of the antigravity cubes had been left open by fivedecrees
The energy of the cubes lightened the house to an extent that made itoffer less than normal resistance to the tempest and it also buoyed itto withstand the shock of tumble from the upper crust of the sphere
How like an old friend that car looked
My heart labored at the meresight of it
It was to be our bridge through space if so we couldcontrive although it might easily fall out to prove bridge for theking and the Gaddbaizets to the earths undoing
After we had halted at the base of the car the king approached theprofessor
Your metal house is intact and uninjured said his majesty save forthe door that gives admittance to it
It was necessary to burn out thelock with draft of zet before the door could be opened
The telescopeand the tub of white pigment have both been replaced and you will Ithink find all your goods and chattels intact
How long before we canstart
Let me first understand your arrangements your majesty the professoranswered
Are you or Olox to guide the car through space to yourintended destination
You are to do that
Neither nor Olox could manage the car fear
Then am to accompany you
have so decided
What of my friends
They are to be left here
You need not worry about them however asthey will be well cared for
have already given proof of my interestin them
Before can give you an answer as to when it will be well to startQuinn remarked after little thought shall have to go into the carand make some calculations
We will go in with you returned the king
should prefer to take only Mr Munn with me sir
The king became suspicious and Olox got the royal ear and saidsomething in an undertone on his wordbox
You and Munn may go in the king said when Olox had finished but weshall keep the rest of your friends with us while you are making yourcalculations
Very well
The professor and thereupon entered the car watched with someapprehension by Meigs and the rest
Possibly they feared that we wereabout to desert them if so the look the professor gave them must haveset their fears at rest
survey of the interior of the car showed everything to be exactly aswe had left it
The door at the top of the iron stairway had beenforced precisely as the other at the outside entrance had been but thiswas matter of small importance
The oxygen tank was intact and the professor showed me how tomanipulate the lever that regulated the supply necessary for the carthere was still plenty of water of good quality in the reservoir andof food such as we were accustomed to there was an abundance
Everything appeared to be in proper order and just as it should be
We are very fortunate Mr Munn said Quinn seating himself on box
brought you in here with me less to have your help in examining theinterior of the car than to seize an opportunity for giving you fewdirections which you will find of use
When we left Earth we started at an hour which gave us course thatangled sunward when you leave Njambai however you must do so at anhour when this part of the planet is turned away from the sun and asfar away as possible
That will cause the car to be hurled toward theouter edge of the solar system and in the direction of the earthsorbit
wish could inform you as to the exact position the earth will be inwhen you cross its orbit but the kings mad project was sprung sosuddenly and he has acted upon his plan so quickly that have had notime for calculations in that respect
Your business however will be to overhaul the Earth
The telescopewill inform you of the planets position and by properly regulating thescreens of the cubes you can hang in the orbit of Terra until it reachesyou then once within its influence shut off the energy of the cubesand suffer the car to fall to its surface
Do make myself plain
Entirely so professor replied
You understand the dangers of landing
All you can do is to experimentwith the atmosphere while you are falling exactly as we did whenlanding here
On your quickness and discretion will depend the lives ofyourself and the others who will be with you
It is great responsibility sir said but you can depend upon meto do my utmost to avoid disaster
He pressed my hand to assure me of his confidence
Midnight tonight will be the hour to start
The crater of the volcanowill then be at its farthest from the sun
shall so inform the kingwhen we leave the car
Have you thought of any plan whereby we may outwit his majesty
have thought of it
Prior to the moment of embarking shallrequest his majesty to allow you and the rest of our friends to comeaboard while detain him and his followers outside for few finalinstructions
The king will suspect nothing for he will not imaginethat would allow you to escape and leave me behind
shudder to think of that part of it murmured
Will you notreconsider your determination professor
No Mr Munn
On that point am adamant
The instant you enter thecar hurry aloft and set loose the oxygen
will drop this bit of ropenear the door when we leave and you will have to make use of it to tiethe door securely shut on the inside
Mind what tell youdo not pullthe lever until the door is securely closed
will remember
The car is exactly under the crater opening and you will have clearpath aloft
Therefore would advise that you throw the lever to ninetythe instant the door is fastened
think that is all
Your work is simple enough for in order to reachTerra you have only to reduce or expand the energy of the antigravitycubes
We will now go below and rejoin the king
Just few minutes more professor begged
This may be our lastopportunity for private talk and there is something wish to tellyou
He turned back from the top of the iron stairway
Go ahead Mr Munn said he
All of us whom you brought to Njambai proceeded are changed men
To you alone we owe this and wish to go on record here and now forgiving you credit
see my past as thought never should see itand realize how have wasted large part of my life
shall provea worthy citizen if we succeed in getting back to Earth and it is youwho have brought about my reformation
glow came to the professors face
He held up one hand protestingly
It is the truth insisted
You have argued with me constantly eversince we were thrown together and it was while on the road to Baigolthat the truth of your arguments suddenly came home to me
stretched out my hand but he held back
You are too shrewd man Mr Munn said he kindly to be sodeceived
There have been times when your artlessness made me wonderbut you have never aroused my wonder quite so much as you have now
Why is that
asked puzzled
Answer me this Mr Munn he went on
How did it chance that MrGilhooly so suddenly recovered his reason
He lost his wits suddenly and crazed people have been known to regaintheir sanity as quickly as they lost it
It must have been so inGilhoolys case
he said smiling
And was it merely coincidence that youfound your conscience and Gilhooly his reason at the same time
Merely coincidence replied
He laughed and it was his first happy laugh since King Gaddbai hadannounced his coming campaign in the direction of Terra
Let us go further he went on
What caused Markham Popham and Meigsto change their points of view so miraculously
Was it the coal minesthe lack of food and the need of decent clothing
All that merely paved the way averred
Your arguments did therest
You are blind Mr Munn
It was not the sufferings our friendsendured nor my arguments
Then what was it
The Bolla
recoiled staring blankly at the kindly face before me
Dont let me part from you Professor Quinn whispered hoarselyfeeling that have left behind man of unsound mind
If thoughtthat believe should remain here with you at any cost
Unsound mind
he returned
My dear Munn
My brain was neverclearer nor my reasoning more sound than at the present moment
Youfound the Bolla
The moment you picked it up every unworthy thoughtvanished from your mind and you became morally the man you ought to be
You did not understand the cause of your salvation and you hurled thestone from you
Gilhooly picked it up
What happened then
Did he notrecover his senses and true outlook upon life at one and the sametime
Yet as if this were not enough to prove clear case for theBolla note the change in Popham Markham and Meigs when asked them toexamine the stone
All this sir should prove my contention beyond allperadventure
am filled with wonder because you have gone so farafield in trying to explain what has occurred
The notion amazed and in measure disappointed me
black stonehad turned me from my evil coursea mere bit of insensate matter aboutwhich clustered the traditions and superstitious veneration of allNjambians
My regeneration had come from without and not from withinand if there was no credit for the professor in my awakening then therewas still less for myself
Not the operations of my own mind urged and guided by the friendlycounsels of the professor but stone which had picked up to castaway had worked my transformation
The fact still remained and would always remain but it was in no wayflattering to me
What was going on in my mind must have been divined bythe professor for he stepped close and took the hand which he had amoment before refused
The methods of Fate are inexplicable to us mortals Mr Munn said hebut what matters it how thing is brought to pass so long as it reallyhappens
And why should we concern ourselves with failure tounderstand the underlying cause
Great is the Bolla my friend eventhough its powers pass our comprehension
shall make it point to seethat it is returned to King Golbai during my probation here
Toaccomplish that and at the same time keep watchful eyes on KingGaddbai will not let time hang heavy on my hands
And you will not reconsiderHe knew what was about to say pressed my hand restrainingly and gotup from his seat
Presently he removed few feet of rope from bale and took lastlong look around him
What his thoughts were will not even hazard aguess
Cutting loose from every tie that held him to Earth knew very wellwhat my feelings would have been under the circumstances
But havealready stated that the professor was queer in his outlook upon lifeand in his grasp of ways and means so my pen hesitates to attempt adescription of his emotions at this critical moment
When we emerged from the steel shell the king and his retainers crowdedclose to hear what my companion had to say
His majesty was greatlydisappointed on learning that the start was not to be made until somehours had passed but he smothered his impatience and busied himselfwith communication to the regent giving the exact hour the expeditionintended to take its departure
The historian chosen to accompany the monarch and put into imperishableideographs the history he was to make transcribed the kings messageand it was dispatched by courier to the capital
Following thisbusiness his majesty entertained us with review of the Gaddbaizetsselected by Olox for the expedition
The diminutive soldiers were welldrilled wellequipped and presenteda dazzling spectacle in their gilt war paint and yellow kirtles
They were truly the flower of the country
Each carried pair ofzetbais filled to the white tip with special supply of zet
Quinn now that his mind was made up to defeat the king and to remain onNjambia displayed much interest in the maneuvres even going so far asto applaud them
Stores of prepared food had been collected in baleswhich were piled in heap beside the car ready for loading
One bale was opened toward the close of day and we used its contentsfor our supper rations
Night fell and the professor asked me to enterthe car and light the lamp on the table
did so and in the glow thatcame through the car windows we who were not gifted with the owlsightof the Njambaians were able to see little of what went on around us
As the night advanced and King Gaddbai evinced his impatience andexcitement by walking back and forth in front of his picked guardstrains of the national anthem were borne to us from distance
Louderand louder swelled the tones of the wordboxes and at last the regentarrived accompanied by host from the town
They were there to give their monarch rousing sendoff and smiled alittle as thought of the disappointment that was likely to overtakethem
While felicitations were being exchanged between the king and hispeople Professor Quinn asked me to consult my watch
found that wewere within fifteen minutes of midnight
My timepiece was not strictly accurate inasmuch as in the excitingevents of the morning had neglected my usual custom of setting thehand three minutes back
However the indicated time was close enoughfor all practical purposes
Into the car with you Mr Munn said the professor as calmly asthough his command were not going to separate him from his kind for alleternity
would have taken his hand had he not observed the movementand said quickly
Be careful
We must not let these people suspect by word orgesture the sort of coup we are planning
Take the others with youIwill speak to the king and cover your movements as have alreadyoutlined
Those were Professor Quinns last words to me
My final glimpse of himshowed me his resolute face and slender form drifting away into thegloom in the direction of King Gaddbai
felt as though must run after him and drag him into the car whetherhe would or no
How succeeded in fighting down the mad impulse hasever since been mystery to me but did and word to Popham MeigsMarkham and Gilhooly who had already been informed that they were toexpect startling dénouement brought them after me into the steelstructure
heard Olox give loud command for us to turn back but his wordboxwas suddenly quieted and presumed that the professor had already gonefar enough with his part of the ruse to lull any suspicions that hadarisen
Rope that steel door on the inside Gilhooly
cried as bounded upthe iron stairs
Gilhooly did not know what had been planned but leaped instantly to thetask
With quick pull of the lever opened the oxygen tank anddashed below once more
Something had gone wrong outsideI did not know what and do not know tothis day
The mysterious violet fire which accompanied discharge ofthe zetbais was rolling all around the steel wall that hemmed us in anda perfect tumult of shrieks and cries came frantically to our cars
Violent hands were laid on the door pushing it inward against the ropemade fast by Gilhooly
Gilhooly and the others hurled themselves at theportal and flung it back holding it so by main strength
Well be killed
shouted Meigs
No yelled and jumped to the switch board
The next instant the switch was thrown and the billows of fire fadedfrom the car windows as if by magic
We were saved
Again had we plunged into space and behind usliving ordead knew notwe had left Professor Quinn
Sinking down on my knees buried my face in my hands
CHAPTER XIX
BACK TO EARTH
have heard some one say that life is only dream and that when weawaken in the other country we shall find it so
Far be it from me todispute this or affirm it yet know of my own experience that ourwaking moments furnish events that seem as illusory as the stuff thatdreams are made of
Of all our strange adventures the flight from Njambai has been the onethat recall with most vividness and at the same time as seeming themost unreal
The tension of my nerves at the moment may account forthis
As stated somewhere close to the beginning of this narrative what Iset out to write was description of the planet Mercury in so far as mylimited abilities for observation enabled me to gather knowledge
Inlooking back over my manuscript find have made it more of anadventurous tale than intended
Now when near the close can hold more closely to my text and dealonly generally with our return trip to Terra
It is needless to dwellupon the way we missed and mourned the professor
At every turn somewant developed which he could easily have satisfied had he been with us
However his wisdom had started us correctly and we had perforce tomake shift and get along without him as best we could
As captain ofthe car the weight of great responsibility rested on me
wasalmost constantly at the telescope and kept Gilhoolyin whom hadthe most confidenceabout as constantly at the switch board
We were menaced by frequent dangers during the trip our course beingliterally strewn with meteoroids which it required much deft maneuvringto evade but we came safely out of these perils and as if tocompensate us for them we formed most happy juncture with the Earthsorbit at time when that planet was approaching and nearly upon us
With Gilhooly at the lever and myself at the telescope we accomplisheda very successful landing
So evenly balanced did the car hang betweenthe cubes and the drawing power of gravity that the last thousand feetof our descent was merely floating earthward and we alighted with soslight shock that none of us experienced particle of inconvenience
The land that claimed us was deserted island in midPacific where weremained for two weeks living off our food supply and keeping sharplookout for sail
We had not been more than day on the island before remembered thedocument Professor Quinn had given me
had been directed to open itwhile on our way through the great void but had been so burdened withresponsibilities during that time that had not once thought of thepacket
With my four companions as auditors read aloud one of the papersinclosed in the packet which was addressed to all of us jointly
MY DEAR FRIENDS When you read this trust that the plans of myself and Mr Munn will have proved so far successful that an impassable gulf will stretch between you and the undersignedand write this out of desire to have you speeding on your return to our native planet not because would willingly separate myself from you were circumstances here different from what we have found them
As long as live shall stand between King Gaddbai and any monstrous plan he may form and attempt to carry out looking to the subjugating of the world we know and love so well
am convinced that the king has resources of which we know nothing and it shall be my aim to fathom the resources of Njambai and assist in their development along other and more peaceable lines
This is to be my work and enter upon it with tranquil soul
No doubt took what you gentlemen may think was an unwarranted liberty in luring four of your number to my castle and casting it adrift in the unknown
As for myself believe had ample warrant for doing what did will not dwell on that motive as it is already familiar to you
The experience each of you has had on Njambai has been most salutary
You have undergone change of heart and reform has wrought its great work
Had not been assured of this none of you would ever have left this sphere for that other one which has been the cradle of your pet schemes in speculation
You are not the same men you were
As reformers you will do your share to preserve our noble country from dire calamities that threaten it
That is your mission and see to it that you fail not in its performance
It is my prayerful hope that you will reach your destination in safety and with Mr Munn at the helm am prone to think that this result will be achieved
If civilized country claims you immediately upon landing it is my wish that you give full power to the antigravity cubes and send the car into space it is my wish that none of you give record of his experiences to the papers either wholly or in part until five years have passed and then that this duty devolve upon Mr Munn and it is my final wish that Mr Munn accept the enclosed deed to my Harlem lot and the enclosed check making payable to him all the funds have in bank
would have him return to the other four of you an equivalent for the funds and valuables stolen the night we left Earth in the car
My second wish as to the revelations you gentlemen could make is born of desire to save the earth dwellers any unnecessary fear on the score of King Gaddbai and his undertakings
If he has not invaded Terra with his terrifying zetbais by the time five years have elapsed it is my conviction that the danger will be done away with forever
Gentlemen adieu
As you read this give you hail from Njambai
fortnight after the reading of the above document we sighted sailon the horizon and by means of rope reaching from the switch boardthrough window the lever was pulled and Professor Quinns castle shotinto the clouds and vanished for all time
Three hours later we werepicked up by whale boat conveyed to the tramp steamer Mollie Oand in month sailed through the Golden Gate into San Francisco harbor
The five years have passed and have set my hand to the foregoing
Gilhooly and Meigs have crossed to the great majority but the strenuouswork they did in the interests of the people is an imperishable monumentto their memory
Popham and Markham are still laboring for the good ofthe cause
The return to home and friends of these four long given up for deadcaused sensation throughout the country
True to the expressed wishof Professor Quinn none of them has breathed whisper of the marvelousthings he saw or of the weird experiences that fell to his lot whilejourneying to and from Njambai and while sojourning upon that planet
So far as am concerned my life since my return to Earth has been asspotless as thorough reformation could make it
As far as could Ihave reimbursed those from whom took what was not rightfully mine Ihave pleaded the cause of the poor man and helped him liberally out ofthe generous fortune bestowed upon me by Professor Quinn and intendto pursue this line of action until the last day of my life
Could reformed burglar have more suitable occupation

General Information About Project Gutenberg electronicworks
Professor Michael Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergconcept of library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone
For thirty years he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg eBooks with only loose network of volunteer support
Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printededitions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unlessa copyright notice is included
Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooksin compliance with any particular paper edition
Each eBook is in subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks eBooknumber often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCIIcompressed zipped HTML and others
Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number
The replaced older file is renamed
Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers
