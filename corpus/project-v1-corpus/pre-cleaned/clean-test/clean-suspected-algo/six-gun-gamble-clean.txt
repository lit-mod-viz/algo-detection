SIXGUN GAMBLE By JAMES OLSEN Rancher Joe Burnie was no hand with sixgun and his skunkaroo enemy Ben Grute was gunman who was as sharp as tack
There had to be showdown because Joe wouldnt run away even though his staying would mean deathand then suddenly Joe Burnie discovered other ways to be literally fighter sharp as tack himself
TIM OMARA on the prod was like thunderhead riding up to darken thesunbathed New Mexi co hills
Dismounting where his pard and neighbor JoeBurnie was starting con struction on new adobe house lanky Irishman worea dark expression on his face and Colt on his hip
Considering that TimOMara was man who wore smile habitually and sixshooter set dom thesigns were ominous
Joe Tim grimly announced without preamble Ben Grutehas shot an kilt our Hereford bull an Im goin to kill Ben Grute Stocky sandyhaired Joe Burnie was younger than Tim OMara but more levelheaded and contained
He didnt blow up although he and Tim sweated anddenied themselves equally in order to buy that blooded bull and six heifers
Theyd aimed to raise breeders and improve the small range herd they ranpooled on their adjoining spreads
Loss of the bull was bard blow yet Joeaccepted it with cold eyed calmness and customary grave deliberation whilethinking it over
This mawnin Tim irately elaborated rode upcrick to see after theHere fords an found section of our fence pulled down
The bull was deadover on Grutes side of the fencelineHow dyou know Grute done it Joe questioned levelly
Whoinell else woulda Tim chal lenged
Them three pulqueswillin breeds who run Grates mangy sheeps an cattle while he loafs in Sierrita orrides gun trails they wouldntve
Be sides Grate woulda wanted the fun ofdoin sech stinkin job hissef Joe Burnie looked at the stacks of cured dobe bricks ready to form the househe and Judy Ward would occupy when it was built and they were married
Scowling uneasily he looked back at Tim and stated You cant go gunnin forGrute Tim
Hes killer an When Im crowded cn be one too
Tim snarled
An it aint your place to deal with him Joe went on We know Grute nev erhad chance with Judy Ward but he hates my guts because she took up with mewhen come here
Now that its been announced that Judy an me are goin tobe married Grates aimin to raise hell with us outa sheer spite anmeanness
Thats why he kilt our bull an so its up to me to handle thesettlin up Since yuh put er thetaway Tim grudgingly agreed allow the firstlicks yours
But how do you aim to go about takin it Not with sixgun Joe declared
aint no shucks with one an wouldnttry makin settlement with one if was
Thats just what Grute hopes Illdo giv in him chance to kill me
blieve in law an order Tim an soIm goin to the law an ask for an arrest of Grute then ask for damages Yuhll ask an yuhll git nawthin Tim snorted
But go ahead
Afteryuhve wasted time Ill try Grute in Colt Court Tims truculence forbade further ar gument
Silent Joe got his horse
Hissixgun battered relic he never packed anyhow he left behind in his cabinwhen he and Tim jogged away toward the town of Sierrita
Packing beltgunin volved risk of gunplay Joe figured
He wished Tim would shuck hishardware
HE silence of siesta hour cloaked Sierrita when Joe and Tim rode in
Asthey racked their horses at one edge of the plaza Joe glanced over toward the notionsanddrygoods store where Judy Ward worked hoping she hadnt seen themride in
Apparently she hadnt and Joe was glad because he didnt want tohave to tell her why theyd come to town until after things had been settled
No use worrying Judy unnecessarily he fig ured
Poor kid shed had too manywor ries anyhow since her fatherd died and shed had to sell their littleranch to level the debts hed left
Grute pestering after her had been herbiggest worry and she feared the man
Judy Ward wasnt the only one who was afraid of Ben Grute who left his coyotespread for his breed hands to run while he stayed in Sierrita gamblingdrink ing and roughhandling the darkskinned senoritas
majority of thepopulace feared Grute whod killed two men here on his own stomping groundsand whose gun was for hire away from there
Strangers would hit town and talkto him or hed receive letter and then Grute would ride out
When hereturned hed be wellheeled with cash and would make bragging reference to agunslinging job hed done in Texas New Mexico or Ari zona
So folks inSierrita had reason to fear Ben Grute
Walking over to the west side of the square Joe and Tim looked into the office of Jose Garcia dealer in mohair wool and hides
As sideline Garciawas deputy sheriff the only law in that part of the county
Finding the office empty Tim said Hell be in Cojos cantina an Grutelllikely be there too
Cmon No gunplay mind you Joe admon ished
Tim grunted sourly as they headed for Cojos
Entering they found Garcia hisbig paunch pressed against the bar talk ing to the lame owner
As Tim hadpre dicted Grate was also in the dingy place
glass of aguardiente at hiselbow cigar between his thin lips he sat over game of solitaire at atable against the wall
big devil who affected foxed buok skin clothing and wore his black hairlong and his sixgun lowandtied Grute looked up and sneered at Joe and Tim
Tim twisted his lips back at Grute but Joe ignoring him stepped up toGarcia and said want to swear out warrant against Grute there
He shotan killed our Hereford bull Eh
Wat ees thees Instantly un happy and apprehensive the deputy turnedhis fat face toward the man at the table
Taking the cigar out of his mouth Grute spat Damn right shot thebellerin devil
Yesterday on the way to my sheep camp heard snuffunsnortun an bawlin
rode up to find that Here ford had busted down thefence an was killin one of my range bulls
When tried to stop im he comeat my horse so shot the damn critter
was on my own range Garcia anwithin my rights an any sons wantin to say diffrunt can have their dealinsdirect with me So Ill make er direct by callin yuh liar Tim erupted
Our fencesexter strong along yuhr line
claim yuh pulled it down then run our bullacrost onto yuhr range an shot im Tim warned you not to start noth in Joe barked
Peace senores Garcia croaked
the law command eet ILLERS lust fired Grutes snaky eyes as he leaped to his feet but he madeno play for his gunpartly because of Garcia but mostly because Tim was readyto fight
Grute never tackled man who was set for trouble if he could avoidit
No matter what gunswift edge he held Grute preferred to wait stack thedeck all in his favor and name the time for turning the cards
Wy would Grute weesh to tear down the fence an keel your bool like yousay Garcia arched his bushy brows at Joe
They aint got no proof it was like that Grute jeered
Garcia eyed Joe questioningly
His ex pression bitter Joe shook his head
Pat ently relieved Garcia declared Seence there ees no proof the booldont try to gore Grute can be no warrant issued an no arrest
You geetproof geet warrant
Meantime must bid you adios amigos an tell youto keep the peacefulness Garcia showed them broad stern as he turned and waddled out
Watching himgo Tim growled Wal Joe told yuh so An Ill tell you somethun OMara Grute snarled as he stepped close toTim
Just because Burnies too yaller to pack sixgun an do his ownfightin it dont mean you can horn in for him call me liar an get awaywith it As he spoke Grute raised his left hand and shook his finger under Tims noseand Joe tried to step around Tim and get between him and Grute
Driving Joeback with hard thrust of one elbow Tim raged at Grute Damn yuh stopshakin yuhr finger under my nose an draw Simultaneous with the sounds of palms slapping gunbutts and leather Grutelunged and drove the heel of his upraised left hand against Tims chest
Itwas doubtful that Tim even under the best circumstances could have begun tohave matched Grutes gunspeed
Now stag gered backward and off balancecaught flat by Grutes foul trick he hadnt the ghost of show
His Colt hadbarely cleared leather when the blast of Grutes sixshooter jarred thecantina
Tim rocked back teetered on his heels dropped his Colt and pressed bothhands against his chest
Shockfaced vacant eyed his knees suddenly buckledand he plunged forward to the floor
Through little swirl of gunsmoke Joe looked down at Tim then up at GruteJoes eyes were glazed by sudden grief and the damning realization that Timwas dead
The wolfish killers ex pression on Grutes face maddened Joe
Ananimal cry on his lips ignoring the Colt in Grutes hand Joe sprang at him
Grute struck out with the sixgun lay ing the barrel along Joes forehead
Blood gushing from long gash above one eye stunned Joe dropped to hisknees
Next time we meet youd better be packin iron or Ill give you pistolwhippin you wont likely live over Grute snarled at Joe as Jose Garcia andseveral townsmen came hightailing in
Madre de Dios Garcia cried tell you to be peaceable That loco OMara drawed first Grute grunted
Looking over at Cojo acrossthe bar he added Aint that right
Speak up Cojo gave Grute stare of dislike
But Cojo was lame and old and thoughtfulof his own welfare
Regretfully Cojo an swered Si Sleeving blood off his face swaying on widespread legs Joe croaked Grutetricked
Tim Garcia
tried to stop things but Tim elbowed me back
ThenGrute pulled his shovin trick on Tim tried to stop him from drawin an gettin hisself killed Grute gruntedas he went back to his table and picked up his drink
Gripping Joes
arm Garcia led him doorward
Regretfully he said sabetheengs but wat can do
So better now you go away from Grute
weel have OMara took to the onder taker OODENLY Joe moved through the crowd outside Cojos and cut across the plazatoward the doctors
From the doorway of the store where she worked JudyWard saw him
darkhaired girl with pulseaccelerating figure Judy ran to him cryingJoe are you badly hurt
Whats hap pened to you
What happened in the cantina Before Joe could answer the doctor emerged from his office his kit in hand
Seeing Joe blood streaming down his face he came toward him asking Burnie does anyone in Cojos need me No Joe intoned
Tim OMaras there but you cant help him Doc
Thatsneakin Grute killed Tim an it was my fault Judy gasped but said nothing as they went into the doctors office
Therepre paring to attend Joes injury the doctor said Joe if you want totalk tell Judy what happened go ahead
Harshvoiced Joe told about the bull and subsequent events then said Soysee Judy its my fault Tims dead
If Id been packin gun couldasided him
shoulda listened to him in the first place an known it was loco to run tothe law
Now that Ive learned that its too late to do Tim any goodbut nottoo late for me to try to finish what he started Such was Joes bitterness he didnt even seem to notice it when the doctorstitched the gash above his eye
Now while the doctor fastened bandage inplace Judy caught hold of Joes hand and gently protested But Joe Timsdeath wasnt your fault
If Tim hadnt been carrying gun thered have beenno gun battle
If he hadnt lost his temper in Cojos hadnt elbowed youaway hed not have been killed
So you see Joe it couldnt be your fault Mebbe not Joe bleakly conceded
But if Id packed my sixgun couldveat leastve tried tove held up my end to day And Grute would have killed you Judy said
Thats what he wants
If hedseen no safe chance against both you and Tim hed have waited until hecreated situation to his liking Yeah Joe growled hed awaited
He wont quit Judy so Im goin to getmy gun an face the son an get it over with Nonsense the doctor snapped
Youre dazed from the blow and the shock ofTims sudden death
You listen to Judy man Theres the matter of the bull bein killed Joe persisted
And not shred of proof that Grute did it illegally the doctor said aswith meaning glance at Judy he turned and left the room
Alone with Joe Judy put her arms around his neck and kissed him
Joe shebegged for my sake let Grute alone
Well hurry our marriage
After thatIm sure Grute wont bother us any more Judys plea the unshed tears glistening in her eyes and the urgent yieldingof her young body in Joes arms broke his stubborn resolve
After all Judyand the doctor likely were right and long life TT WAS on Sunday morning some two weeks after Tim OMara had been buried inSierritas dobewaUed grave yard when Judy rode out to spend the day withJoe
Throughout those two weeks he had spent most of his time rush ing thenew house toward completion
Hed been able to do that because it was theslack season and Ben Grute wasnt around to be watched out for
The day aftershooting Tim Grute had ridden off somewhere to do paid job of killing
Judy was surprised to find the walls up and the window and doorframes in
Going through the house she tried to be gay as she decided how shed place thefur niture but her gaiety was forced
Final ly unable to pretend anylonger she blurted Joe you must be careful
Grute returned to Sierritayesterday then rode on out to his spread
Garcia brought me that news andsaid to warn you So Joe grunted
Then reckon Id better go haze back any stock thatmighta drifted to the fenceline
Wanta ride along Getting his horse Joe led the way east Joe suddenly started shaking and his stomach began to roll over as thereaction of his first killing seized him
ward onto Tims range Joes now since he and Tim had been pards and Tim hadno living kin
Riding through juniper and pifion they came to lushcreekside mead ow where few steers grazed
Looking them over Joe raspedThem Hereford heifers was here two days ago
Now with Judy was better thanan eternity in boothill
Joe yielded groaning All right
But tell you now dont think waitinsany good
Grute wont rest until weve had er out Theyre gone an theydidnt just drift off by themsefs
See them tracks Judy whitefaced nodded but said nothing as they followed the tracks of thesix Herefords and shod horse up out of the meadow and to the fenceiine
There three fenceposts and the wire be tween was flat or the ground and thetracks crossed there
Ill likely find em all dead over there Joe snarled
Im going with you Judy stated
And dont tell me cant
Joe shrugged and they rode across the line onto Grutes range following thetracks into draw
little ways along it turned sharply and they came upagainst barrier of freshly cut timber that held Joes Herefords corraled inthe draw above it
dont savvy this Joe muttered
wonder What the heUre you doin on my range
Judy gave an involuntary cry
Together she and Joe reined their horses aroundand faced Ben Grute whod slid down into the draw behind them
Hands on hipsGrute eyed Joe balefully
You know what Im doin Joe answered flatly
You ran my heifers up here soId have to come onto your range didnt you They driftedherelikely huntin that bull Grute jeered
An since youbrung Judy along to perfect you maybe shell help pay the fee for themgrazin on my range
Its buck day apiece an Ag ger they been hereall the fifteen days been gone You aint cuttin no such rusty on me Joe stonily stated
Dismounting he walked up and began pulling the brush aside
Damn you Burnie Grute snarled as he walked toward Joe who faced the taller heavier man with fists raised
Since youre too yaller to pack gunlike warned you to an you got Judy here to ride herd on you reckonthere aint much can do this time
So take your damn critters an get tohell yonderly Lowering his fists Joe turned toward the barrier
Grute hit him then hisleft fist opening the barely healed gash above Joes eye right fist slammingagainst Joes temple
Lights and fierce pain flash ing in his head Joe wentdown
He gasped as Grute kicked him in theribs rolled away and got upweaving dizzily
He swung feeble blow at Grute as the lat ter charged himand again Joe hit the ground
After that Joe had no idea how many cuttingblows he took nor how many times he staggered up and was knocked down untilhe was unable to rise again
Grute he heard Judy screamand heard rifle crack
Grute one foot lifted to grind his boot heel into Joes face jerked back asthe bullet from the rifle Judy had gotten oat of Joes saddle boot sang overhis head
Grute drew his breath in sharply
The desperate expression onJudys face told him that she would put the next slug through him if she hadto shoot again
All right Grute barked
Take your weaklin an get off my range
An dontthink aint holdin this agin you you heifer Climbing out of the draw Grute got his horse out of the scrub and rode away
Sitting up Joe groaned aint half man
dont do nothin when Grutekills Tim an now youve had to save my hide Lifting her divided skirt Judy ripped off part of her underskirt and kneltbe side Joe using it to wipe away the blood streaming down his terriblybeaten face
Hush she rebuked him
Grute resort ed to treachery to beatyou even though hes larger than you
He tricked you just as he tricked Timand other men hes killed Helping Joe to his feet Judy had to lead him to his horse because his eyeswere swelling shut
Tearing down the brush barrier then she took to her ownsaddle and drove the Herefords back onto Joes range as she headed Joe forSier rita and the doctor
TT WAS two days before Joe could see and two more before he left his bedin hotel room in town
During that time Judy laid off from work and attended him and she was there when the doctorlet Joe get up
Now watching Joes stiff progress around the room the doctor said Joeyoure lucky jasper
Your cracked rib and battered face will soon heal andthen youll be as good as ever An what goods that Joe bleakly de manded
Joe the doctor counseled picking up his medicine kit dont think likethat
Dont become embittered against your self When the doctor had gone Judy came to Joe and put her arms around him
After lightly kissing his battered lips she said Joe honey the doctorsrightyou mustnt become bitter
Why after you sell out here and we settlesomewhere else youll forget this Sell out Joe laughed and it sound ed like cold wind blowing through atomb
Ythink Id sell what Tim left an high tail
Not me Judy
aintgot to the point where Ill run away from Grute But wed be better off somewhere else Judy protested
Would weknowin that Id rabbited
Uhuh Joe shook his head
Besidesthiss where want to stay an where will stayeither on top of the groundor six feet under it Then what do you mean to do Joe Judy quavered
Right now he answered Im goin out an see to things on the spread
Illlikely be back in couple of days or so Telling Judy solong Joe got his horse out of the feed barn eased himselfstiffly into the saddle and rode out of town
Three days later happening to be look ing out through the store window Judysaw him ride back in
Watching him rack his horse she was relieved to seethat he packed no gun
Since Joe wasnt heeled Judy figured that he hadntcome in to have showdown with Grute
Shed have felt less easy had sheknown that Joes old singleaction was in one of his saddlebags
Grossing the plaza Joe entered the office of Nabor Andrade Sierritas lawyerand justice of the peace
There taking the chair Andrade offered heannounced want you to fix me up will Andrade gave Joe shrewd glance
The lines of determination around Joesmouth and the dull tone of finality in his voice didnt escape the lawyer
Heavily he sat down at his desk and wrote as Joe dictated will that leftJoes worldly pos sessions to Judy
When the will was finished and signed Joe arose and said You keep itAndrade until its needed You intend to go after Ben Grute Andrade surmised
Not exactly Joe smiled bleakly
aim to strap my cutter on then go whereGrute is
Trust that son to do the rest Why commit suicide playing Grutes game Andrade demanded
Why notchallenge him to fight with rifles or to meet you in the street both of youwith your guns already drawn
That way you might have some hope of killingthat spawn of Diablo Ythink Grute would accept any such challenge Joe hooted
That cabrone no Andrade sourly admitted
But he added you have nochance against him any other way
Not only is Grute lightningfast with hispis tol but hes as sharp as tack when it comes to pulling dirty gunfighttricks Yeah sharp as tack Joe echoed
Frowning he snapped his fingers suddenly like man whod remembered something or had hit on good idea and exclaimed But his sharp trickery might be the hole card need to give as ahaf way even chance in the game How can that be Andrade wondered
He received no answer because Joe was leaving the oifice
Watching him goAndrade shook his head and wondered if Joe hadnt gone little loco to thinkthat he had chance in drawandshootout with Grute
As for that Joe knew how slim his chances were
But the idea that had come tohim did give him little bit or chance and that was lot better than noneat all
So pursuing that idea he went from Andrades to the hardware storebought box of carpet tacks and then headed for Deputy Jose Garcias
LOLLING BACK in his chair the dep uty sheriff and hide dealer straight enedup when Joe entered his office
Wor riedly he said Joe eet ees not goodthat youre een Sierrita now
Grute ees over een Cojos an there weel betrouble eef you ron eento heem Nmind him Joe brushed Garcias worries aside
Have you got an ol cowhide one thats no good layin around anywhere Nodding Garcia got up and led the way out to shed in back of his office
Point ing at hide hanging on hook he indignantly said There ees tornone some crook put een bale bought When Joe then opened his pocket knife and cut footsquare piece out ofthe dried tough cowhide Garcia was un able to contain his curiosityWat he begged to know ees eet for Its hole card Joe told him
An thanks lot Watching Joe walk away Garcia like Andrade was wondering if Joe Burniehadnt gone haywire in the cabeza
Had he seen Joe as the latter went over tothe livery barn and into an empty stall Garcia would have sworn that Joe wasas nutty as pifion tree
Kneeling he laid the square of cowhide on thefloor took the box of carpet tacks out of his pocket and began sticking themthrough the hide
little later when the hide had been studded with tacks Joe left the barnemptyhanded
Going back to his horse he got his holstered Colt out of thesaddle bag and buckled the belt around him
That done he made cigaretteand stood with his head thoughtfully bowed while he smoked
Tossing the buttaway then he drew deep breath squared his shoulders and walked down the street to Cojos
Cojo serving two cowpunchers at the far end of the bar scowled apprehensively when Joe came in
At his favorite table by the wall Grute sat reading anold newspaper
Looking up his eyes narrowed when he saw the sixshooter dragging at Joes right hip and then hun gry wolfish grin spread over hisface
Rising quickly Grute said Burnie wanta see you and stepped over to thebar
Well Joe grunted you aint blind are you You talkin up trouble Grute snarled
Youll get it if you dont pay whatyou owe me for your critters grazin on my range Thell with you Joe Burnie hooted
Burnie warn you not to rile me or force me to draw my iron an burn whatyou owe me out of your hide
So youd bet ter fork over the dinero an rideclose herd on your mouth
Savvy As he spoke Grute raised his left hand and began shaking his finger underJoes nose
That was the move Joe had hoped for
Bracing himself he leaned alittle toward Grute and barked We both got guns so stop the gab an grab Grute as they went for their guns stiffened his left arm and rammed thepalms of his upraised left hand against Joes chest
For an instant then hisfeatures twisting the fluid rhythm of his draw was broken and he jerked asthough hed contacted wire charged with elec tricity
In that split secondJoe got the break hed played forbut it was barely an even break and nothingmore
The guns of both men cleared leather and flashed flame and leadsimultaneously
The only difference between them was that Grute surprisedand upset by the sudden realization that his trick to cinch surefire killhad boomeranged threw his lead away
His slug tugged at Joes shirt left awelt along Joes left side
Joes bullets placed with cold delibera tionsmashed Grutes chest
horrible shocked expression on his face staggered by the force of Joeslead Grute dropped his sixgun and gripped the rim of the bar
Swaying hetried to speak but managed only wet grunting sound
That sound thenbecame hideous gurgle and his hold loosening Grute col lapsed his bodywedging down between the face of the bar and the brass footrail
STANDING there staring down at Ben Grutes body Joe suddenly started shakingand his stomach began to roll over as the reaction of killinghis firstkillingseized him
Knowing what Joe was going through old Cojo limped hurriedly along the bar and thrust bottle of whiskey into Joes hand
Dreenk big dreenk Cojo command ed
You be aright The drink steadied Joe
Hed stopped shaking when Deputy Garcia who wasfollowed by the doctor ran panting into the cantina
Stopping short when hesaw that Grute not Joe was down Garcia beat his fat palms together andcried Thees ees ver good
Ai bueno And good job of shooting Joe the doctor said after hasty examinationof the body
But how did you beat his draw Before Joe could answer Judy rushed into the cantina
Tears streaming downher cheeks her relief overwhelmed her when she saw that Joe was still amongthe living
Crying his name she flung herself on him before he could preventit
Ohhh Squealing Judy leaped backward
Red lips parted she pressed her handsto her breasts and eyed Joe in pained bewilderment
Grinning sheepishly Joe unbuttoned his shirt untied rawhide thong andpulled out the tackstudded square of cow hide that had been tied over hischest
Offering it to Garcia he said My hole card amigo
You savvy now Good gravy one of the cowboys whod witnessed the gunfight exclaimed
Soats why the son kinda bogged down when he shoved youhe jabbed his paw onthe pints of them there tacks Uhhuh Joe nodded
got the idea when Andrade said that Grute was sharpas tack when it come to dirty tricks
So dealt me that hole card gamblinthat Grute would try the same trick on me that he tried on Tim
Ysee all Iwanted was an even breakbut Im wonderin if you folks think it was fair onmy part Holy smoke The doctor clapped one hand to his forehead
He gambles his lifefor an even break then asks us was he fair But he wouldnt gamble on marrying me before Inadvertantly glancing atGrutes body Judy left her teasing sen tence unfinished
Taking hold of Judys arm Joe escort ed her out of Cojos
Motioning to thedoc tor to come along Garcia followed them
Outside beyond the crowdaround the door Judy and Joe halted and the doctor and Garcia joined them
You say thees sopoor sport wont marry you eh Garcia sighed and shook hishead at Judy
Ees bad
like for to geet up baile an dance een the plaza
weddeeng would be fine oxcuse Andrade could tie the knot the doctor added
Not till our houses finished Joe stubbornly demurred
Impulsively unmindful of onlookers Judy flung her arms around Joes neckpulled his head down and pressed her lips to his
It wasnt quick kiss nora cool one either
As the seconds went by Joes ears reddened Garcia becameslack jawed and the doctor mopped his face with his handkerchief andwhistled long and softly
There Breathless and starryeyed Judy at last let go of Joe
Now do youwant to wait until our house is finished Joe Momma Joe exploded that settles it
Doc you an Garcia come alongwellneed you for witnesses Grabbing Judys hand then he lit out for Nabor Andrades on the run
