THE OCTOPUSA Story of Californiaby Frank NorrisBOOK CHAPTER IJust after passing Carahers saloon on the County Road that ran southfrom Bonneville and that divided the Broderson ranch from that of LosMuertos Presley was suddenly aware of the faint and prolonged blowingof steam whistle that he knew must come from the railroad shops nearthe depot at Bonneville
In starting out from the ranch house thatmorning he had forgotten his watch and was now perplexed to knowwhether the whistle was blowing for twelve or for one oclock
He hopedthe former
Early that morning he had decided to make long excursionthrough the neighbouring country partly on foot and partly on hisbicycle and now noon was come already and as yet he had hardlystarted
As he was leaving the house after breakfast Mrs Derrick hadasked him to go for the mail at Bonneville and he had not been able torefuse
He took firmer hold of the cork grips of his handlebarsthe roadbeing in wretched condition after the recent hauling of the cropandquickened his pace
He told himself that no matter what the time washe would not stop for luncheon at the ranch house but would push onto Guadalajara and have Spanish dinner at Solotaris as he hadoriginally planned
There had not been much of crop to haul that year
Half of the wheaton the Broderson ranch had failed entirely and Derrick himself hadhardly raised more than enough to supply seed for the winters sowing
But such little hauling as there had been had reduced the roadsthereabouts to lamentable condition and during the dry season of thepast few months the layer of dust had deepened and thickened to suchan extent that more than once Presley was obliged to dismount and trudgealong on foot pushing his bicycle in front of him
It was the last half of September the very end of the dry season andall Tulare County all the vast reaches of the San Joaquin Valleyinfact all South Central California was bone dry parched and bakedand crisped after four months of cloudless weather when the day seemedalways at noon and the sun blazed white hot over the valley from theCoast Range in the west to the foothills of the Sierras in the east
As Presley drew near to the point where what was known as the Lower Roadstruck off through the Rancho de Los Muertos leading on to Guadalajarahe came upon one of the county wateringtanks great ironhoopedtower of wood straddling clumsily on its four uprights by the roadside
Since the day of its completion the storekeepers and retailers ofBonneville had painted their advertisements upon it
It was landmark
In that reach of level fields the white letters upon it could be readfor miles
wateringtrough stood near by and as he was very thirstyPresley resolved to stop for moment to get drink
He drew abreast of the tank and halted there leaning his bicycleagainst the fence
couple of men in white overalls were repaintingthe surface of the tank seated on swinging platforms that hung by hooksfrom the roof
They were painting signan advertisement
It was allbut finished and read
Behrman Real Estate Mortgages Main StreetBonneville Opposite the Post Office On the horsetrough that stoodin the shadow of the tank was another freshly painted inscription
Behrman Has Something To Say To YouAs Presley straightened up after drinking from the faucet at one end ofthe horsetrough the wateringcart itself laboured into view aroundthe turn of the Lower Road
Two mules and two horses white with duststrained leisurely in the traces moving at snails pace their limpears marking the time while perched high upon the seat under yellowcotton wagon umbrella Presley recognised Hooven one of Derrickstenants German whom every one called Bismarck an excitable littleman with perpetual grievance and an endless flow of broken English
Hello Bismarck said Presley as Hooven brought his team to astandstill by the tank preparatory to refilling
Yoost der men look for Mistr Praicely cried the other twistingthe reins around the brake
Yoost one minute you wait hey
wantatalk mit youPresley was impatient to be on his way again
little more time wastedand the day would be lost
He had nothing to do with the managementof the ranch and if Hooven wanted any advice from him it was so muchbreath wasted
These uncouth brutes of farmhands and petty ranchersgrimed with the soil they worked upon were odious to him beyond words
Never could he feel in sympathy with them nor with their lives theirways their marriages deaths bickerings and all the monotonous roundof their sordid existence
Well you must be quick about it Bismarck he answered sharply
Imlate for dinner as it isSoh now
Two minuten und be mit you He drew down the overhangingspout of the tank to the vent in the circumference of the cart andpulled the chain that let out the water
Then he climbed down from theseat jumping from the tire of the wheel and taking Presley by the armled him few steps down the road
Say he began
Say want to hef some converzations mit you
Yoostder men want to see
Say Caraher he tole me dis morgensay he toleme Mistr Derrick gowun to farm der whole demn rench hisseluf der nextyahr

Do alzohYoull have to see Derrick himself or Harran about that Bismarck interrupted Presley trying to draw away
Thats something outside ofme entirelyBut Hooven was not to be put off
No doubt he had been meditating hisspeech all the morning formulating his words preparing his phrases
Say no no he continued
Me wanta stay bei der place seven yahrI hef stay
Mistr Derrick he doand want dot should be gesacked
Who den will der ditch getend
Say you tell um Bismarck hef gottasure stay bei der place

Say you hef hear about dose tingI dont hear about anything Bismarck

He waved an arm
Ach der pipeline bei der MissionGreek und der waaterhole for dose cettles
Say he doand doo utHIMSELLUF berhaps doand tinkWell talk to Harran about itSay he doand farm der whole demn rench bei hisseluf
Me gottastayBut on sudden the water in the cart gushed over the sides from thevent in the top with smart sound of splashing
Hooven was forced toturn his attention to it
Presley got his wheel under way
hef some converzations mit Herran Hooven called after him
Hedoand doo ut bei hisseluf den Mistr Derrick ach no
stay bei derrench to drive dose cettlesHe climbed back to his seat under the wagon umbrella and as hestarted his team again with great cracks of his long whip turned to thepainters still at work upon the sign and declared with some defianceSieben yahr yais sir seiben yahr hef been on dis rench
Git oopyou mule you hoopMeanwhile Presley had turned into the Lower Road
He was now onDerricks land division No
or as it was called the Home ranchof the great Los Muertos Rancho
The road was better here the dust laidafter the passage of Hoovens wateringcart and in few minutes hehad come to the ranch house itself with its white picket fence its fewflower beds and grove of eucalyptus trees
On the lawn at the sideof the house he saw Harran in the act of setting out the automaticsprinkler
In the shade of the house by the porch were two or threeof the greyhounds part of the pack that were used to hunt downjackrabbits and Godfrey Harrans prize deerhound
Presley wheeled up the driveway and met Harran by the horseblock
Harran was Magnus Derricks youngest son very welllooking youngfellow of twentythree or twentyfive
He had the fine carriage thatmarked his father and still further resembled him in that he had theDerrick nosehawklike and prominent such as one sees in the laterportraits of the Duke of Wellington
He was blond and incessantexposure to the sun had instead of tanning him brown merely heightenedthe colour of his cheeks
His yellow hair had tendency to curl in aforward direction just in front of the ears
Beside him Presley made the sharpest of contrasts
Presley seemed tohave come of mixed origin appeared to have nature more compositea temperament more complex
Unlike Harran Derrick he seemed more of acharacter than type
The sun had browned his face till it was almostswarthy
His eyes were dark brown and his forehead was the foreheadof the intellectual wide and high with certain unmistakable liftabout it that argued education not only of himself but of his peoplebefore him
The impression conveyed by his mouth and chin was that ofa delicate and highly sensitive nature the lips thin and loosely shuttogether the chin small and rather receding
One guessed that Presleysrefinement had been gained only by certain loss of strength
Oneexpected to find him nervous introspective to discover that his mentallife was not at all the result of impressions and sensations that cameto him from without but rather of thoughts and reflections germinatingfrom within
Though morbidly sensitive to changes in his physicalsurroundings he would be slow to act upon such sensations would notprove impulsive not because he was sluggish but because he was merelyirresolute
It could be foreseen that morally he was of that sortwho avoid evil through good taste lack of decision and want ofopportunity
His temperament was that of the poet when he told himselfhe had been thinking he deceived himself
He had on such occasionsbeen only brooding
Some eighteen months before this time he had been threatened withconsumption and taking advantage of standing invitation on the partof Magnus Derrick had come to stay in the dry even climate of the SanJoaquin for an indefinite length of time
He was thirty years oldand had graduated and postgraduated with high honours from anEastern college where he had devoted himself to passionate study ofliterature and more especially of poetry
It was his insatiable ambition to write verse
But up to this timehis work had been fugitive ephemeral note here and there heardappreciated and forgotten
He was in search of subject somethingmagnificent he did not know exactly what some vast tremendous themeheroic terrible to be unrolled in all the thundering progression ofhexameters
But whatever he wrote and in whatever fashion Presley was determinedthat his poem should be of the West that worlds frontier of Romancewhere new race new peoplehardy brave and passionatewerebuilding an empire where the tumultuous life ran like fire from dawnto dark and from dark to dawn again primitive brutal honest andwithout fear
Something to his idea not much had been done to catch atthat life in passing but its poet had not yet arisen
The few sporadicattempts thus he told himself had only touched the keynote
He strovefor the diapason the great song that should embrace in itself wholeepoch complete era the voice of an entire people wherein all peopleshould be includedthey and their legends their folk lore theirfightings their loves and their lusts their blunt grim humour theirstoicism under stress their adventures their treasures found in dayand gambled in night their direct crude speech their generosityand cruelty their heroism and bestiality their religion and profanitytheir selfsacrifice and obscenitya true and fearless setting forth ofa passing phase of history uncompromising sincere each group in itsproper environment the valley the plain and the mountain the ranchthe range and the mineall this all the traits and types of everycommunity from the Dakotas to the Mexicos from Winnipeg to Guadalupegathered together swept together welded and riven together in onesingle mighty song the Song of the West
That was what he dreamedwhile things without namesthoughts for which no man had yet inventedwords terrible formless shapes vague figures colossal monstrousdistortedwhirled at gallop through his imagination
As Harran came up Presley reached down into the pouches of thesunbleached shooting coat he wore and drew out and handed him thepacket of letters and papers
Heres the mail
think shall go onBut dinner is ready said Harran we are just sitting downPresley shook his head
No Im in hurry
Perhaps shall havesomething to eat at Guadalajara
shall be gone all dayHe delayed few moments longer tightening loose nut on his forwardwheel while Harran recognising his fathers handwriting on one of theenvelopes slit it open and cast his eye rapidly over its pages
The Governor is coming home he exclaimed tomorrow morning on theearly train wants me to meet him with the team at Guadalajara AND hecried between his clenched teeth as he continued to read weve lostthe caseWhat case
Oh in the matter of ratesHarran nodded his eyes flashing his face growing suddenly scarlet
Ulsteen gave his decision yesterday he continued reading from hisfathers letter
He holds Ulsteen does that grain rates as low asthe new figure would amount to confiscation of property and that onsuch basis the railroad could not be operated at legitimate profit
As he is powerless to legislate in the matter he can only put the ratesback at what they originally were before the commissioners made thecut and it is so ordered
Thats our friend Behrman again addedHarran grinding his teeth
He was up in the city the whole of the timethe new schedule was being drawn and he and Ulsteen and the RailroadCommission were as thick as thieves
He has been up there all this lastweek too doing the railroads dirty work and backing Ulsteen up
Legitimate profit legitimate profit he broke out
Can we raisewheat at legitimate profit with tariff of four dollars ton formoving it two hundred miles to tidewater with wheat at eightysevencents
Why not hold us up with gun in our faces and say hands upand be done with itHe dug his bootheel into the ground and turned away to the houseabruptly cursing beneath his breath
By the way Presley called after him Hooven wants to see you
Heasked me about this idea of the Governors of getting along without thetenants this year
Hooven wants to stay to tend the ditch and look afterthe stock
told him to see youHarran his mind full of other things nodded to say he understood
Presley only waited till he had disappeared indoors so that he mightnot seem too indifferent to his trouble then remounting struck atonce into brisk pace and turning out from the carriage gate heldon swiftly down the Lower Road going in the direction of Guadalajara
These matters these eternal fierce bickerings between the farmers ofthe San Joaquin and the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad irritated himand wearied him
He cared for none of these things
They did not belongto his world
In the picture of that huge romantic West that he saw inhis imagination these dissensions made the one note of harsh colourthat refused to enter into the great scheme of harmony
It was materialsordid deadly commonplace
But however he strove to shut his eyes toit or his ears to it the thing persisted and persisted
The romanceseemed complete up to that point
There it broke there it failed thereit became realism grim unlovely unyielding
To be trueand it wasthe first article of his creed to be unflinchingly truehe could notignore it
All the noble poetry of the ranchthe valleyseemed in hismind to be marred and disfigured by the presence of certain immovablefacts
Just what he wanted Presley hardly knew
On one hand it was hisambition to portray life as he saw itdirectly frankly and through nomedium of personality or temperament
But on the other hand as wellhe wished to see everything through rosecoloured mista mist thatdulled all harsh outlines all crude and violent colours
He toldhimself that as part of the people he loved the people andsympathised with their hopes and fears and joys and griefs and yetHooven grimy and perspiring with his perpetual grievance and hiscontracted horizon only revolted him
He had set himself the task ofgiving true absolutely true poetical expression to the life of theranch and yet again and again he brought up against the railroadthat stubborn iron barrier against which his romance shattered itself tofroth and disintegrated flying spume
His heart went out to the peopleand his groping hand met that of slovenly little Dutchman whom it wasimpossible to consider seriously
He searched for the True Romance andin the end found grain rates and unjust freight tariffs
But the stuff is HERE he muttered as he sent his wheel rumblingacross the bridge over Broderson Creek
The romance the real romanceis here somewhere
Ill get hold of it yetHe shot glance about him as if in search of the inspiration
By now hewas not quite half way across the northern and narrowest corner of LosMuertos at this point some eight miles wide
He was still on the Homeranch
few miles to the south he could just make out the line of wirefence that separated it from the third division and to the north seenfaint and blue through the haze and shimmer of the noon sun long fileof telegraph poles showed the line of the railroad and marked Derricksnortheast boundary
The road over which Presley was travelling ranalmost diametrically straight
In front of him but at great distancehe could make out the giant liveoak and the red roof of Hoovens barnthat stood near it
All about him the country was flat
In all directions he could see formiles
The harvest was just over
Nothing but stubble remained on theground
With the one exception of the liveoak by Hoovens place therewas nothing green in sight
The wheat stubble was of dirty yellow theground parched cracked and dry of cheerless brown
By the roadsidethe dust lay thick and grey and on either hand stretching on towardthe horizon losing itself in mere smudge in the distance ran theillimitable parallels of the wire fence
And that was all that and theburntout blue of the sky and the steady shimmer of the heat
The silence was infinite
After the harvest small though that harvesthad been the ranches seemed asleep
It was as though the earth afterits period of reproduction its pains of labour had been delivered ofthe fruit of its loins and now slept the sleep of exhaustion
It was the period between seasons when nothing was being done when thenatural forces seemed to hang suspended
There was no rain there was nowind there was no growth no life the very stubble had no force evento rot
The sun alone moved
Toward two oclock Presley reached Hoovens place two or three grimyframe buildings infested with swarm of dogs
hog or two wanderedaimlessly about
Under shed by the barn brokendown seeder layrusting to its ruin
But overhead mammoth liveoak the largest treein all the countryside towered superb and magnificent
Grey bunchesof mistletoe and festoons of trailing moss hung from its bark
From itslowest branch hung Hoovens meatsafe square box faced with wirescreens
What gave special interest to Hoovens was the fact that here was theintersection of the Lower Road and Derricks main irrigating ditch avast trench not yet completed which he and Annixter who worked theQuien Sabe ranch were jointly constructing
It ran directly acrossthe road and at right angles to it and lay deep groove in the fieldbetween Hoovens and the town of Guadalajara some three miles fartheron
Besides this the ditch was natural boundary between two divisionsof the Los Muertos ranch the first and fourth
Presley now had the choice of two routes
His objective point was thespring at the headwaters of Broderson Creek in the hills on theeastern side of the Quien Sabe ranch
The trail afforded him short cutthitherward
As he passed the house Mrs Hooven came to the door herlittle daughter Hilda dressed in boys overalls and clumsy boots ather skirts
Minna her oldest daughter very pretty girl whoselove affairs were continually the talk of all Los Muertos was visiblethrough window of the house busy at the weeks washing
Mrs Hoovenwas faded colourless woman middleaged and commonplace and offeringnot the least characteristic that would distinguish her from thousandother women of her class and kind
She nodded to Presley watchinghim with stolid gaze from under her arm which she held across herforehead to shade her eyes
But now Presley exerted himself in good earnest
His bicycle flew
He resolved that after all he would go to Guadalajara
He crossed thebridge over the irrigating ditch with brusque spurt of hollow soundand shot forward down the last stretch of the Lower Road that yetintervened between Hoovens and the town
He was on the fourth divisionof the ranch now the only one whereon the wheat had been successful nodoubt because of the Little Mission Creek that ran through it
But he nolonger occupied himself with the landscape
His only concern was to geton as fast as possible
He had looked forward to spending nearly thewhole day on the crest of the wooded hills in the northern corner of theQuien Sabe ranch reading idling smoking his pipe
But now he woulddo well if he arrived there by the middle of the afternoon
In fewmoments he had reached the line fence that marked the limits of theranch
Here were the railroad tracks and just beyonda huddled mass ofroofs with here and there an adobe house on its outskirtsthe littletown of Guadalajara
Nearer at hand and directly in front of Presleywere the freight and passenger depots of the and painted inthe grey and white which seemed to be the official colours of all thebuildings owned by the corporation
The station was deserted
No trainspassed at this hour
From the direction of the ticket window Presleyheard the unsteady chittering of the telegraph key
In the shadow ofone of the baggage trucks upon the platform the great yellow cat thatbelonged to the agent dozed complacently her paws tucked under herbody
Three flat cars loaded with brightpainted farming machineswere on the siding above the station while on the switch below hugefreight engine that lacked its cowcatcher sat back upon its monstrousdrivingwheels motionless solid drawing long breaths that werepunctuated by the subdued sound of its steampump clicking at exactintervals
But evidently it had been decreed that Presley should be stopped atevery point of his ride that day for as he was pushing his bicycleacross the tracks he was surprised to hear his name called
Hellothere Mr Presley
Whats the good wordPresley looked up quickly and saw Dyke the engineer leaning onhis folded arms from the cab window of the freight engine
But at theprospect of this further delay Presley was less troubled
Dyke and hewere well acquainted and the best of friends
The picturesqueness of theengineers life was always attractive to Presley and more than once hehad ridden on Dykes engine between Guadalajara and Bonneville
Onceeven he had made the entire run between the latter town and SanFrancisco in the cab
Dykes home was in Guadalajara
He lived in one of the remodelled dobecottages where his mother kept house for him
His wife had died somefive years before this time leaving him little daughter Sidney tobring up as best he could
Dyke himself was heavy built welllookingfellow nearly twice the weight of Presley with great shoulders andmassive hairy arms and tremendous rumbling voice
Hello old man answered Presley coming up to the engine
What areyou doing about here at this time of day
thought you were on thenight service this monthWeve changed about bit answered the other
Come up here and sitdown and get out of the sun
Theyve held us here to wait orders heexplained as Presley after leaning his bicycle against the tenderclimbed to the firemans seat of worn green leather
They are changingthe run of one of the crack passenger engines down below and aresending her up to Fresno
There was smash of some kind on theBakersfield division and shes to hell and gone behind her time
Isuppose when she comes shell come ahumming
It will be stand clearand an open track all the way to Fresno
They have held me here to lether go byHe took his pipe an old clay but coloured to beautiful shinyblack from the pocket of his jumper and filled and lit it
Well dont suppose you object to being held here observed Presley
Gives you chance to visit your mother and the little girlAnd precisely they choose this day to go up to Sacramento answeredDyke
Just my luck
Went up to visit my brothers people
By the waymy brother may come down herelocate here meanand go into thehopraising business
Hes got an option on five hundred acres just backof the town here
He says there is going to be money in hops
dontknow may be Ill go in with himWhy whats the matter with railroadingDyke drew couple of puffs on his pipe and fixed Presley with aglance
Theres this the matter with it he said Im firedFired
You exclaimed Presley turning abruptly toward him
Thatswhat Im telling you returned Dyke grimly
You dont mean it
Why what for DykeNow YOU tell me what for growled the other savagely
Boy and manIve worked for the and for over ten years and never one yelpof complaint did ever hear from them
They know damn well theyvenot got steadier man on the road
And more than that more than thatI dont belong to the Brotherhood
And when the strike came along Istood by themstood by the company
You know that
And you know andthey know that at Sacramento that time ran my train according toschedule with gun in each hand never knowing when was going over amined culvert and there was talk of giving me gold watch at thetime
To hell with their gold watches

And now when hard times come along and they are cuttingwages what do they do
Do they make any discrimination in my case
Dothey remember the man that stood by them and risked his life in theirservice
They cut my pay down just as offhand as they do the payof any dirty little wiper in the yard
Cut me along withlisten tothiscut me along with men that they had BLACKLISTED strikers thatthey took back because they were short of hands He drew fiercely onhis pipe
went to them yes did went to the General Office andate dirt
told them was family man and that didnt see howI was going to get along on the new scale and reminded them of myservice during the strike
The swine told me that it wouldnt be fairto discriminate in favour of one man and that the cut must apply to alltheir employees alike
Fair he shouted with laughter
Hear theP and talking about fairness and discrimination
Thats goodthat is
Well got furious
was fool suppose
told them thatin justice to myself wouldnt do firstclass work for thirdclasspay
And they said Well Mr Dyke you know what you can do
Well Idid know
said Ill ask for my time if you please and they gaveit to me just as if they were glad to be shut of me
So there you arePresley
Thats the Railroad Company of California
am onmy last run nowShameful declared Presley his sympathies all aroused now that thetrouble concerned friend of his
Its shameful Dyke
But he addedan idea occurring to him that dont shut you out from work
There areother railroads in the State that are not controlled by the and SWDyke smote his knee with his clenched fist
NAME ONEPresley was silent
Dykes challenge was unanswerable
There was lapsein their talk Presley drumming on the arm of the seat meditating onthis injustice Dyke looking off over the fields beyond the town hisfrown lowering his teeth rasping upon his pipestem
The station agentcame to the door of the depot stretching and yawning
On ahead of theengine the empty rails of the track reaching out toward the horizonthrew off visible layers of heat
The telegraph key clicked incessantly
So Im going to quit Dyke remarked after while his anger somewhatsubsided
My brother and will take up this hop ranch
Ive saved agood deal in the last ten years and there ought to be money in hopsPresley went on remounting his bicycle wheeling silently through thedeserted streets of the decayed and dying Mexican town
It was the hourof the siesta
Nobody was about
There was no business in the town
Itwas too close to Bonneville for that
Before the railroad came andin the days when the raising of cattle was the great industry ofthe country it had enjoyed fierce and brilliant life
Now it wasmoribund
The drug store the two barrooms the hotel at the corner ofthe old Plaza and the shops where Mexican curios were sold to thoseoccasional Eastern tourists who came to visit the Mission of San Juansufficed for the towns activity
At Solotaris the restaurant on the Plaza diagonally across from thehotel Presley ate his longdeferred Mexican dinneran omelette inSpanishMexican style frijoles and tortillas salad and glassof white wine
In corner of the room during the whole course of hisdinner two young Mexicans one of whom was astonishingly handsomeafter the melodramatic fashion of his race and an old fellow
thecentenarian of the town decrepit beyond belief sang an interminablelovesong to the accompaniment of guitar and an accordion
These SpanishMexicans decayed picturesque vicious and romanticnever failed to interest Presley
few of them still remained inGuadalajara drifting from the saloon to the restaurant and from therestaurant to the Plaza relics of former generation standing for adifferent order of things absolutely idle living God knew how happywith their cigarette their guitar their glass of mescal and theirsiesta
The centenarian remembered Fremont and Governor Alvarado andthe bandit Jesus Tejeda and the days when Los Muertos was Spanishgrant veritable principality leagues in extent and when therewas never fence from Visalia to Fresno
Upon this occasion Presleyoffered the old man drink of mescal and excited him to talk of thethings he remembered
Their talk was in Spanish language with whichPresley was familiar
De La Cuesta held the grant of Los Muertos in those days thecentenarian said grand man
He had the power of life and death overhis people and there was no law but his word
There was no thought ofwheat then you may believe
It was all cattle in those days sheephorsessteers not so manyand if money was scarce there was alwaysplenty to eat and clothes enough for all and wine ah yes by thevat and oil too the Mission Fathers had that
Yes and there was wheatas well now that come to think but very littlein the field northof the Mission where now it is the Seed ranch wheat fields were thereand also vineyard all on Mission grounds
Wheat olives and thevine the Fathers planted those to provide the elements of the HolySacramentbread oil and wine you understand
It was like that thoseindustries began in Californiafrom the Church and now he put hischin in the air what would Father Ullivari have said to such cropas Senor Derrick plants these days
Ten thousand acres of wheat
Nothingbut wheat from the Sierra to the Coast Range
remember when De LaCuesta was married
He had never seen the young lady only her miniatureportrait paintedhe raised shoulderI do not know by whom smalla little thing to be held in the palm
But he fell in love with thatand marry her he would
The affair was arranged between him and thegirls parents
But when the time came that De La Cuesta was to go toMonterey to meet and marry the girl behold Jesus Tejeda broke in uponthe small rancheros near Terrabella
It was no time for De La Cuesta tobe away so he sent his brother Esteban to Monterey to marry the girl byproxy for him
went with Esteban
We were company nearly hundredmen
And De La Cuesta sent horse for the girl to ride white purewhite and the saddle was of red leather the headstall the bitand buckles all the metal work of virgin silver
Well there wasa ceremony in the Monterey Mission and Esteban in the name of hisbrother was married to the girl
On our way back De La Cuesta rodeout to meet us
His company met ours at Agatha dos Palos
Never willI forget De La Cuestas face as his eyes fell upon the girl
It was alook glance come and gone like THAT he snapped his fingers
Noone but saw it but was close by
There was no mistaking that look
De La Cuesta was disappointedAnd the girl demanded Presley
She never knew
Ah he was grand gentleman De La Cuesta
Always hetreated her as queen
Never was husband more devoted more respectfulmore chivalrous
But love The old fellow put his chin in the airshutting his eyes in knowing fashion
It was not there
could tell
They were married over again at the Mission San Juan de GuadalajaraOURMissionand for week all the town of Guadalajara was in fete
Therewere bullfights in the Plazathis very onefor five days and to eachof his tenantsinchief De La Cuesta gave horse barrel of tallowan ounce of silver and half an ounce of gold dust
Ah those were days
That was gay life
Thishe made comprehensive gesture with hisleft handthis is stupidYou may well say that observed Presley moodily discouraged by theothers talk
All his doubts and uncertainty had returned to him
Neverwould he grasp the subject of his great poem
Today the life wascolourless
Romance was dead
He had lived too late
To write of thepast was not what he desired
Reality was what he longed for thingsthat he had seen
Yet how to make this compatible with romance
He roseputting on his hat offering the old man cigarette
The centenarianaccepted with the air of grandee and extended his horn snuffbox
Presley shook his head
was born too late for that he declared for that and for manyother things
AdiosYou are travelling today senorA little turn through the country to get the kinks out of themuscles Presley answered
go up into the Quien Sabe into the highcountry beyond the MissionAh the Quien Sabe rancho
The sheep are grazing there this weekSolotari the keeper of the restaurant explainedYoung Annixter sold his wheat stubble on the ground to the sheepraisers off yonder he motioned eastward toward the Sierra foothills
Since Sunday the herd has been down
Very clever that young Annixter
He gets price for his stubble which else he would have to burn andalso manures his land as the sheep move from place to place
trueYankee that Annixter good gringoAfter his meal Presley once more mounted his bicycle and leaving therestaurant and the Plaza behind him held on through the main street ofthe drowsing townthe street that farther on developed into the roadwhich turned abruptly northward and led onward through the hopfieldsand the Quien Sabe ranch toward the Mission of San Juan
The Home ranch of the Quien Sabe was in the little triangle bounded onthe south by the railroad on the northwest by Broderson Creek and onthe east by the hop fields and the Mission lands
It was traversed inall directions now by the trail from Hoovens now by the irrigatingditchthe same which Presley had crossed earlier in the dayand againby the road upon which Presley then found himself
In its centre wereAnnixters ranch house and barns topped by the skeletonlike tower ofthe artesian well that was to feed the irrigating ditch
Farther onthe course of Broderson Creek was marked by curved line of greygreenwillows while on the low hills to the north as Presley advanced theancient Mission of San Juan de Guadalajara with its belfry tower andredtiled roof began to show itself over the crests of the venerablepear trees that clustered in its garden
When Presley reached Annixters ranch house he found young Annixterhimself stretched in his hammock behind the mosquitobar on the frontporch reading David Copperfield and gorging himself with driedprunes
Annixterafter the two had exchanged greetingscomplained of terrificcolics all the preceding night
His stomach was out of whack butyou bet he knew how to take care of himself the last spell he hadconsulted doctor at Bonneville gibbering busyface who had filledhim up to the neck with dose of some hogwash stuff that had made himworsea healthy lot the doctors knew anyhow
HIS case was peculiar
HEknew prunes were what he needed and by the pound
Annixter who worked the Quien Sabe ranchsome four thousand acresof rich clay and heavy loamswas very young man younger even thanPresley like him college graduate
He looked never year older thanhe was
He was smoothshaven and lean built
But his youthful appearancewas offset by certain male cast of countenance the lower lip thrustout the chin large and deeply cleft
His university course had hardenedrather than polished him
He still remained one of the people roughalmost to insolence direct in speech intolerant in his opinionsrelying upon absolutely no one but himself yet with all this ofan astonishing degree of intelligence and possessed of an executiveability little short of positive genius
He was ferocious workerallowing himself no pleasures and exacting the same degree of energyfrom all his subordinates
He was widely hated and as widely trusted
Every one spoke of his crusty temper and bullying dispositioninvariably qualifying the statement with commendation of his resourcesand capabilities
The devil of driver hard man to get along withobstinate contrary cantankerous but brains
No doubt of that brainsto his boots
One would like to see the man who could get ahead of himon deal
Twice he had been shot at once from ambush on Ostermansranch and once by one of his own men whom he had kicked from thesacking platform of his harvester for gross negligence
At collegehe had specialised on finance political economy and scientificagriculture
After his graduation he stood almost at the very top ofhis class he had returned and obtained the degree of civil engineer
Then suddenly he had taken notion that practical knowledge of lawwas indispensable to modern farmer
In eight months he did the work ofthree years studying for his bar examinations
His method of study wascharacteristic
He reduced all the material of his textbooks to notes
Tearing out the leaves of these notebooks he pasted them upon thewalls of his room then in his shirtsleeves cheap cigar in histeeth his hands in his pockets he walked around and around the roomscowling fiercely at his notes memorising devouring digesting
Atintervals he drank great cupfuls of unsweetened black coffee
When thebar examinations were held he was admitted at the very head of all theapplicants and was complimented by the judge
Immediately afterwardshe collapsed with nervous prostration his stomach got out of whack and he all but died in Sacramento boardinghouse obstinately refusingto have anything to do with doctors whom he vituperated as rabbleof quacks dosing himself with patent medicine and stuffing himselfalmost to bursting with liver pills and dried prunes
He had taken trip to Europe after this sickness to put himselfcompletely to rights
He intended to be gone year but returned atthe end of six weeks fulminating abuse of European cooking
Nearly hisentire time had been spent in Paris but of this sojourn he had broughtback but two souvenirs an electroplated billhook and an empty birdcage which had tickled his fancy immensely
He was wealthy
Only year previous to this his fathera widower whohad amassed fortune in land speculationhad died and Annixter theonly son had come into the inheritance
For Presley Annixter professed great admiration holding in deeprespect the man who could rhyme words deferring to him whenever therewas question of literature or works of fiction
No doubt there wasnot much use in poetry and as for novels to his mind there were onlyDickenss works
Everything else was lot of lies
But just the sameit took brains to grind out poem
It wasnt every one who could rhymebrave and glaive and make sense out of it
Sure not
But Presleys case was notable exception
On no occasion wasAnnixter prepared to accept another mans opinion without reserve
In conversation with him it was almost impossible to make any directstatement however trivial that he would accept without eithermodification or open contradiction
He had passion for violentdiscussion
He would argue upon every subject in the range ofhuman knowledge from astronomy to the tariff from the doctrine ofpredestination to the height of horse
Never would he admit himself tobe mistaken when cornered he would intrench himself behind the remarkYes thats all very well
In some ways it is and then again insome ways it ISNTSingularly enough he and Presley were the best of friends
More thanonce Presley marvelled at this state of affairs telling himselfthat he and Annixter had nothing in common
In all his circle ofacquaintances Presley was the one man with whom Annixter had neverquarrelled
The two men were diametrically opposed in temperament
Presley was easygoing Annixter alert
Presley was confirmeddreamer irresolute inactive with strong tendency to melancholythe young farmer was man of affairs decisive combative whoseonly reflection upon his interior economy was morbid concern inthe vagaries of his stomach
Yet the two never met without mutualpleasure taking genuine interest in each others affairs and oftenputting themselves to great inconvenience to be of trifling service tohelp one another
As last characteristic Annixter pretended to be womanhater forno other reason than that he was very bullcalf of awkwardness infeminine surroundings
There was fine way for man towaste his time and his good money lally gagging with lot of feemales
No thank you none of it in HIS if you please
Once only he had anaffaira timid little creature in glovecleaning establishment inSacramento whom he had picked up Heaven knew how
After his returnto his ranch correspondence had been maintained between the twoAnnixter taking the precaution to typewrite his letters and neveraffixing his signature in an excess of prudence
He furthermore madecarbon copies of all his letters filing them away in compartmentof his safe
Ah it would be clever feemale who would get him into amess
Then suddenly smitten with panic terror that he had committedhimself that he was involving himself too deeply he had abruptly sentthe little woman about her business
It was his only love affair
Afterthat he kept himself free
No petticoats should ever have hold onhim
Sure not
As Presley came up to the edge of the porch pushing his bicycle infront of him Annixter excused himself for not getting up alleging thatthe cramps returned the moment he was off his back
What are you doing up this way he demanded
Oh just having look around answered Presley
Hows the ranchSay observed the other ignoring his question whats this hearabout Derrick giving his tenants the bounce and working Los Muertoshimselfworking ALL his landPresley made sharp movement of impatience with his free hand
Iveheard nothing else myself since morning
suppose it must be soHuh grunted Annixter spitting out prune stone
You give MagnusDerrick my compliments and tell him hes fool What do you meanI suppose Derrick thinks hes still running his mine and that the sameprinciples will apply to getting grain out of the earth as to gettinggold
Oh let him go on and see where he brings up
Thats righttheres your Western farmer he exclaimed contemptuously
Get theguts out of your land work it to death never give it rest
Neveralternate your crop and then when your soil is exhausted sit down androar about hard timesI suppose Magnus thinks the land has had rest enough these last two dryseasons observed Presley
He has raised no crop to speak of for twoyears
The land has had good restAh yes that sounds well Annixter contradicted unwilling to beconvinced
In way the lands been rested and then again in wayit hasntBut Presley scenting an argument refrained from answering andbethought himself of moving on
Im going to leave my wheel here for while Buck he said if youdont mind
Im going up to the spring and the road is rough betweenhere and thereStop in for dinner on your way back said Annixter
Therell be avenison steak
One of the boys got deer over in the foothills lastweek
Out of season but never mind that
cant eat it
This stomachof mine wouldnt digest sweet oil today
Get here about sixWell maybe will thank you said Presley moving off
By the way he added see your barn is about doneYou bet answered Annixter
In about fortnight now shell be allreadyIts big barn murmured Presley glancing around the angle of thehouse toward where the great structure stood
Guess well have to have dance there before we move the stock in observed Annixter
Thats the custom all around herePresley took himself off but at the gate Annixter called after him hismouth full of prunes Say take look at that herd of sheep as you goup
They are right off here to the east of the road about half milefrom here
guess thats the biggest lot of sheep YOU ever saw
Youmight write poem about em
Lambram sheep grazesunny days
CatchonBeyond Broderson Creek as Presley advanced tramping along on foot nowthe land opened out again into the same vast spaces of dull brown earthsprinkled with stubble such as had been characteristic of Derricksranch
To the east the reach seemed infinite flat cheerlessheatridden unrolling like gigantic scroll toward the faint shimmerof the distant horizons with here and there an isolated liveoak tobreak the sombre monotony
But bordering the road to the westward thesurface roughened and raised clambering up to the higher ground on thecrest of which the old Mission and its surrounding pear trees were nowplainly visible
Just beyond the Mission the road bent abruptly eastward striking offacross the Seed ranch
But Presley left the road at this point goingon across the open fields
There was no longer any trail
It was towardthree oclock
The sun still spun silent blazing disc high in theheavens and tramping through the clods of uneven broken plough wasfatiguing work
The slope of the lowest foothills begun the surface ofthe country became rolling and suddenly as he topped higher ridgePresley came upon the sheep
Already he had passed the larger part of the herdan intervening riseof ground having hidden it from sight
Now as he turned half way aboutlooking down into the shallow hollow between him and the curve of thecreek he saw them very plainly
The fringe of the herd was some twohundred yards distant but its farther side in that illusive shimmer ofhot surface air seemed miles away
The sheep were spread out roughlyin the shape of figure eight two larger herds connected by smallerand were headed to the southward moving slowly grazing on the wheatstubble as they proceeded
But the number seemed incalculable
Hundredsupon hundreds upon hundreds of grey rounded backs all exactly alikehuddled closepacked alive hid the earth from sight
It was no longeran aggregate of individuals
It was massa compact solid slowlymoving mass huge without form like thickpressed growth ofmushrooms spreading out in all directions over the earth
From it therearose vague murmur confused inarticulate like the sound of verydistant surf while all the air in the vicinity was heavy with the warmammoniacal odour of the thousands of crowding bodies
All the colours of the scene were sombrethe brown of the earth thefaded yellow of the dead stubble the grey of the myriad of undulatingbacks
Only on the far side of the herd erect motionlessa singlenote of black speck dotthe shepherd stood leaning upon an emptywatertrough solitary grave impressive
For few moments Presley stood watching
Then as he started to moveon curious thing occurred
At first he thought he had heard some onecall his name
He paused listening there was no sound but the vaguenoise of the moving sheep
Then as this first impression passed itseemed to him that he had been beckoned to
Yet nothing stirred exceptfor the lonely figure beyond the herd there was no one in sight
Hestarted on again and in half dozen steps found himself looking overhis shoulder
Without knowing why he looked toward the shepherd thenhalted and looked second time and third
Had the shepherd calledto him
Presley knew that he had heard no voice
Brusquely all hisattention seemed riveted upon this distant figure
He put one forearmover his eyes to keep off the sun gazing across the intervening herd
Surely the shepherd had called him
But at the next instant he starteduttering an exclamation under his breath
The faraway speck of blackbecame animated
Presley remarked sweeping gesture
Though the manhad not beckoned to him before there was no doubt that he was beckoningnow
Without any hesitation and singularly interested in the incidentPresley turned sharply aside and hurried on toward the shepherdskirting the herd wondering all the time that he should answer the callwith so little question so little hesitation
But the shepherd came forward to meet Presley followed by one of hisdogs
As the two men approached each other Presley closely studyingthe other began to wonder where he had seen him before
It must havebeen very long time ago upon one of his previous visits to the ranch
Certainly however there was something familiar in the shepherds faceand figure
When they came closer to each other and Presley could seehim more distinctly this sense of previous acquaintance was increasedand sharpened
The shepherd was man of about thirtyfive
He was very lean and spare
His brown canvas overalls were thrust into laced boots
cartridge beltwithout any cartridges encircled his waist
grey flannel shirt openat the throat showed his breast tanned and ruddy
He wore no hat
Hishair was very black and rather long
pointed beard covered his chingrowing straight and fine from the hollow cheeks
The absence of anycovering for his head was no doubt habitual with him for his face wasas brown as an Indiansa ruddy brown quite different from Presleysdark olive
To Presleys morbidly keen observation the generalimpression of the shepherds face was intensely interesting
It wasuncommon to an astonishing degree
Presleys vivid imagination chose tosee in it the face of an ascetic of recluse almost that of youngseer
So must have appeared the halfinspired shepherds of the Hebraiclegends the younger prophets of Israel dwellers in the wildernessbeholders of visions having their existence in continual dreamtalkers with God gifted with strange powers
Suddenly at some twenty paces distant from the approaching shepherdPresley stopped short his eyes riveted upon the other
Vanamee he exclaimed
The shepherd smiled and came forward holding out his hands saying Ithought it was you
When saw you come over the hill called youBut not with your voice returned Presley
knew that some onewanted me
felt it
should have remembered that you could do thatkind of thingI have never known it to fail
It helps with the sheepWith the sheepIn way
cant tell exactly how
We dont understand these thingsyet
There are times when if close my eyes and dig my fists intomy temples can hold the entire herd for perhaps minute
Perhapsthough its imagination who knows
But its good to see you again
Howlong has it been since the last time
Two three nearly five yearsIt was more than that
It was six years since Presley and Vanamee hadmet and then it had been for short time only during one of theshepherds periodical brief returns to that part of the country
Duringa week he and Presley had been much together for the two were devotedfriends
Then as abruptly as mysteriously as he had come Vanameedisappeared
Presley awoke one morning to find him gone
Thus it hadbeen with Vanamee for period of sixteen years
He lived his life inthe unknown one could not tell wherein the desert in the mountainsthroughout all the vast and vague Southwest solitary strange
Threefour five years passed
The shepherd would be almost forgotten
Neverthe most trivial scrap of information as to his whereabouts reached LosMuertos
He had melted off into the surfaceshimmer of the desert intothe mirage he sank below the horizons he was swallowed up in the wasteof sand and sage
Then without warning he would reappear coming infrom the wilderness emerging from the unknown
No one knew him well
Inall that countryside he had but three friends Presley Magnus Derrickand the priest at the Mission of San Juan de Guadalajara Father Sarria
He remained always mystery living life halfreal halflegendary
In all those years he did not seem to have grown older by single day
At this time Presley knew him to be thirtysix years of age
But sincethe first day the two had met the shepherds face and bearing had tohis eyes remained the same
At this moment Presley was looking intothe same face he had first seen many many years ago
It was facestamped with an unspeakable sadness deathless grief the permanentimprint of tragedy long past but yet living issue
Presley toldhimself that it was impossible to look long into Vanamees eyes withoutknowing that here was man whose whole being had been at one timeshattered and riven to its lowest depths whose life had suddenlystopped at certain moment of its development
The two friends sat down upon the ledge of the wateringtrough theireyes wandering incessantly toward the slow moving herd grazing on thewheat stubble moving southward as they grazed
Where have you come from this time Presley had asked
Where have youkept yourselfThe other swept the horizon to the south and east with vague gesture
Off there down to the south very far off
So many places that cantremember
went the Long Trail this time long long ways
ArizonaThe Mexicos and then afterwards Utah and Nevada following thehorizon travelling at hazard
Into Arizona first going in by MonumentPass and then on to the south through the country of the Navajos downby the Aga Thia Needlea great blade of red rock jutting from out thedesert like knife thrust
Then on and on through The Mexicos allthrough the Southwest then back again in great circle by Chihuahuaand Aldama to Laredo to Torreon and Albuquerque
From there acrossthe Uncompahgre plateau into the Uintah country then at last due westthrough Nevada to California and to the valley of the San Joaquin Hisvoice lapsed to monotone his eyes becoming fixed he continued tospeak as though half awake his thoughts elsewhere seeing again in theeye of his mind the reach of desert and red hill the purple mountainthe level stretch of alkali leper white all the savage gorgeousdesolation of the Long Trail
He ignored Presley for the moment but on the other hand Presleyhimself gave him but half his attention
The return of Vanamee hadstimulated the poets memory
He recalled the incidents of Vanameeslife reviewing again that terrible drama which had uprooted his soulwhich had driven him forth wanderer shunner of men sojourner inwaste places
He was strangely enough college graduate and man ofwide reading and great intelligence but he had chosen to lead his ownlife which was that of recluse
Of temperament similar in many ways to Presleys there werecapabilities in Vanamee that were not ordinarily to be found in therank and file of men
Living close to nature poet by instinct wherePresley was but poet by training there developed in him greatsensitiveness to beauty and an almost abnormal capacity for greathappiness and great sorrow he felt things intensely deeply
He neverforgot
It was when he was eighteen or nineteen at the formative andmost impressionable period of his life that he had met Angele Varian
Presley barely remembered her as girl of sixteen beautiful almostbeyond expression who lived with an aged aunt on the Seed ranch back ofthe Mission
At this moment he was trying to recall how she looked withher hair of gold hanging in two straight plaits on either side of herface making threecornered her round white forehead her wonderfuleyes violet blue heavy lidded with their astonishing upward slanttoward the temples the slant that gave strange oriental cast to herface perplexing enchanting
He remembered the Egyptian fulness of thelips the strange balancing movement of her head upon her slender neckthe same movement that one sees in snake at poise
Never had he seen agirl more radiantly beautiful never beauty so strange so troublousso out of all accepted standards
It was small wonder that Vanamee hadloved her and less wonder still that his love had been so intense sopassionate so part of himself
Angele had loved him with love noless than his own
It was one of those legendary passions that sometimesoccur idyllic untouched by civilisation spontaneous as the growth oftrees natural as dewfall strong as the firmseated mountains
At the time of his meeting with Angele Vanamee was living on the LosMuertos ranch
It was there he had chosen to spend one of his collegevacations
But he preferred to pass it in outofdoor work sometimesherding cattle sometimes pitching hay sometimes working with pickand dynamitestick on the ditches in the fourth division of the ranchriding the range mending breaks in the wire fences making himselfgenerally useful
College bred though he was the life pleased him
Hewas as he desired close to nature living the full measure of life aworker among workers taking enjoyment in simple pleasures healthy inmind and body
He believed in an existence passed in this fashion in thecountry working hard eating full drinking deep sleeping dreamlessly
But every night after supper he saddled his pony and rode over to thegarden of the old Mission
The dobe dividing wall on that side whichonce had separated the Mission garden and the Seed ranch had long sincecrumbled away and the boundary between the two pieces of ground wasmarked only by line of venerable pear trees
Here under these treeshe found Angele awaiting him and there the two would sit through thehot still evening their arms about each other watching the moonrise over the foothills listening to the trickle of the water in themossencrusted fountain in the garden and the steady croak of the greatfrogs that lived in the damp north corner of the enclosure
Through allone summer the enchantment of that newfound wonderful love pure anduntainted filled the lives of each of them with its sweetness
Thesummer passed the harvest moon came and went
The nights were verydark
In the deep shade of the pear trees they could no longer see eachother
When they met at the rendezvous Vanamee found her only with hisgroping hands
They did not speak mere words were useless between them
Silently as his reaching hands touched her warm body he took her in hisarms searching for her lips with his
Then one night the tragedy hadsuddenly leaped from out the shadow with the abruptness of an explosion
It was impossible afterwards to reconstruct the manner of itsoccurrence
To Angeles mindwhat there was left of itthe matteralways remained hideous blur blot vague terrible confusion
No doubt they two had been watched the plan succeeded too well for anyother supposition
One moonless night Angele arriving under theblack shadow of the pear trees little earlier than usual found theapparently familiar figure waiting for her
All unsuspecting she gaveherself to the embrace of strange pair of arms and Vanamee arrivingbut score of moments later stumbled over her prostrate body inertand unconscious in the shadow of the overspiring trees
Who was the Other
Angele was carried to her home on the Seed ranchdelirious all but raving and Vanamee with knife and revolver readyranged the countryside like wolf
He was not alone
The whole countyrose raging horrorstruck
Posse after posse was formed sent out andreturned without so much as clue
Upon no one could even the shadowof suspicion be thrown
The Other had withdrawn into an impenetrablemystery
There he remained
He never was found he never was so muchas heard of
legend arose about him this prowler of the night thisstrange fearful figure with an unseen face swooping in there fromout the darkness come and gone in an instant but leaving behind him atrack of terror and death and rage and undying grief
Within the yearin giving birth to the child Angele had died
The little babe was taken by Angeles parents and Angele was buriedin the Mission garden near to the aged grey sun dial
Vanamee stood byduring the ceremony but half conscious of what was going forward
Atthe last moment he had stepped forward looked long into the dead faceframed in its plaits of gold hair the hair that made threecorneredthe round white forehead looked again at the closed eyes with theirperplexing upward slant toward the temples oriental bizarre at thelips with their Egyptian fulness at the sweet slender neck the longslim hands then abruptly turned about
The last clods were filling thegrave at time when he was already far away his horses head turnedtoward the desert
For two years no syllable was heard of him
It was believed that he hadkilled himself
But Vanamee had no thought of that
For two years hewandered through Arizona living in the desert in the wilderness arecluse nomad an ascetic
But doubtless all his heart was in thelittle coffin in the Mission garden
Once in so often he must comeback thither
One day he was seen again in the San Joaquin
The priestFather Sarria returning from visit to the sick at Bonneville met himon the Upper Road
Eighteen years had passed since Angele had died butthe thread of Vanamees life had been snapped
Nothing remained nowbut the tangled ends
He had never forgotten
The long dull ache thepoignant grief had now become part of him
Presley knew this to be so
While Presley had been reflecting upon all this Vanamee had continuedto speak
Presley however had not been wholly inattentive
Whilehis memory was busy reconstructing the details of the drama of theshepherds life another part of his brain had been swiftly registeringpicture after picture that Vanamees monotonous flow of words struckoff as it were upon steadily moving scroll
The music of theunfamiliar names that occurred in his recital was stimulant to thepoets imagination
Presley had the poets passion for expressivesonorous names
As these came and went in Vanamees monotonousundertones like little notes of harmony in musical progression helistened delighted with their resonanceNavajo Quijotoa UintahSonora Laredo Uncompahgreto him they were so many symbols
It washis West that passed unrolling there before the eye of his mindthe open heatscourged round of desert the mesa like vast altarshimmering purple in the royal sunset the still gigantic mountainsheaving into the sky from out the canyons the strenuous fierce lifeof isolated towns lost and forgotten down there far off below thehorizon
Abruptly his great poem his Song of the West leaped up againin his imagination
For the moment he all but held it
It was thereclose at hand
In another instant he would grasp it
Yes yes he exclaimed can see it all
The desert the mountainsall wild primordial untamed
How should have loved to have been withyou
Then perhaps should have got hold of my ideaYour ideaThe great poem of the West
Its that which want to write
Oh toput it all into hexameters strike the great iron note sing the vastterrible song the song of the People the forerunners of empireVanamee understood him perfectly
He nodded gravely
Yes it is there
It is Life the primitive simple direct Lifepassionate tumultuous
Yes there is an epic therePresley caught at the word
It had never before occurred to him
Epic yes thats it
It is the epic Im searching for
And HOW Isearch for it
You dont know
It is sometimes almost an agony
Oftenand often can feel it right there there at my fingertips but Inever quite catch it
It always eludes me
was born too late
Ah toget back to that first cleareyed view of things to see as Homer sawas Beowulf saw as the Nibelungen poets saw
The life is here the sameas then the Poem is here my West is here the primeval epic lifeis here here under our hands in the desert in the mountain on theranch all over here from Winnipeg to Guadalupe
It is the man who islacking the poet we have been educated away from it all
We are out oftouch
We are out of tuneVanamee heard him to the end his grave sad face thoughtful andattentive
Then he rose
am going over to the Mission he said to see Father Sarria
havenot seen him yetHow about the sheepThe dogs will keep them in hand and shall not be gone long
Besidesthat have boy here to help
He is over yonder on the other side ofthe herd
We cant see him from herePresley wondered at the heedlessness of leaving the sheep so slightlyguarded but made no comment and the two started off across the fieldin the direction of the Mission church
Well yes it is thereyour epic observed Vanamee as they wentalong
But why write
Why not LIVE in it
Steep oneself in the heat ofthe desert the glory of the sunset the blue haze of the mesa and thecanyonAs you have done for instanceVanamee nodded
No could not do that declared Presley want to go back but notso far as you
feel that must compromise
must find expression
could not lose myself like that in your desert
When its vastnessoverwhelmed me or its beauty dazzled me or its loneliness weighed downupon me should have to record my impressions
Otherwise shouldsuffocateEach to his own life observed Vanamee
The Mission of San Juan built of brown dobe blocks covered withyellow plaster that at many points had dropped away from the wallsstood on the crest of low rise of the ground facing to the south
Acovered colonnade paved with round worn bricks from whence opened thedoors of the abandoned cells once used by the monks adjoined it on theleft
The roof was of tiled halfcylinders split longitudinally andlaid in alternate rows now concave now convex
The main body of thechurch itself was at right angles to the colonnade and at the point ofintersection rose the belfry tower an ancient campanile where swungthe three cracked bells the gift of the King of Spain
Beyond thechurch was the Mission garden and the graveyard that overlooked the Seedranch in little hollow beyond
Presley and Vanamee went down the long colonnade to the last door nextthe belfry tower and Vanamee pulled the leather thong that hung froma hole in the door setting little bell jangling somewhere in theinterior
The place but for this noise was shrouded in Sundaystillness an absolute repose
Only at intervals one heard the trickleof the unseen fountain and the liquid cooing of doves in the garden
Father Sarria opened the door
He was small man somewhat stout witha smooth and shiny face
He wore frock coat that was rather dirtyslippers and an old yachting cap of blue cloth with broken leathervizor
He was smoking cheap cigar very fat and black
But instantly he recognised Vanamee
His face went all alight withpleasure and astonishment
It seemed as if he would never have finishedshaking both his hands and as it was he released but one of thempatting him affectionately on the shoulder with the other
He wasvoluble in his welcome talking partly in Spanish partly in English
Sohe had come back again this great fellow tanned as an Indian lean asan Indian with an Indians long black hair
But he had not changednot in the very least
His beard had not grown an inch
The rascalnever to give warning to drop down as it were from out the sky
Sucha hermit
To live in the desert
veritable Saint Jerome
Did lionfeed him down there in Arizona or was it raven like Elijah
The goodGod had not fattened him at any rate and apropos he was just aboutto dine himself
He had made salad from his own lettuce
The two woulddine with him eh
For this my son that was lost is found again
But Presley excused himself
Instinctively he felt that Sarria andVanamee wanted to talk of things concerning which he was an outsider
Itwas not at all unlikely that Vanamee would spend half the night beforethe high altar in the church
He took himself away his mind still busy with Vanamees extraordinarylife and character
But as he descended the hill he was startled bya prolonged and raucous cry discordant very harsh thrice repeated atexact intervals and looking up he saw one of Father Sarrias peacocksbalancing himself upon the topmost wire of the fence his long tailtrailing his neck outstretched filling the air with his stupid outcryfor no reason than the desire to make noise
About an hour later toward four in the afternoon Presley reached thespring at the head of the little canyon in the northeast corner of theQuien Sabe ranch the point toward which he had been travelling sinceearly in the forenoon
The place was not without its charm
Innumerableliveoaks overhung the canyon and Broderson Creekthere mererivulet running down from the springgave certain coolness to theair
It was one of the few spots thereabouts that had survived thedry season of the last year
Nearly all the other springs had driedcompletely while Mission Creek on Derricks ranch was nothing betterthan dusty cutting in the ground filled with brittle concave flakesof dried and suncracked mud
Presley climbed to the summit of one of the hillsthe highestthatrose out of the canyon from the crest of which he could see for thirtyfifty sixty miles down the valley and filling his pipe smoked lazilyfor upwards of an hour his head empty of thought allowing himself tosuccumb to pleasant gentle inanition little drowsy comfortable inhis place prone upon the ground warmed just enough by such sunlightas filtered through the liveoaks soothed by the good tobacco and theprolonged murmur of the spring and creek
By degrees the sense of hisown personality became blunted the little wheels and cogs of thoughtmoved slower and slower consciousness dwindled to point the animalin him stretched itself purring
delightful numbness invaded his mindand his body
He was not asleep he was not awake stupefied merelylapsing back to the state of the faun the satyr
After while rousing himself little he shifted his position anddrawing from the pocket of his shooting coat his little treecalfedition of the Odyssey read far into the twentyfirst book whereafter the failure of all the suitors to bend Ulyssess bow it isfinally put with mockery into his own hands
Abruptly the drama ofthe story roused him from all his languor
In an instant he was thepoet again his nerves tingling alive to every sensation responsiveto every impression
The desire of creation of composition grew bigwithin him
Hexameters of his own clamoured tumultuous in his brain
Not for long time had he felt his poem as he called this sensationso poignantly
For an instant he told himself that he actually held it
It was no doubt Vanamees talk that had stimulated him to thispoint
The story of the Long Trail with its desert and mountain itscliffdwellers its Aztec ruins its colour movement and romancefilled his mind with picture after picture
The epic defiled before hisvision like pageant
Once more he shot glance about him as if insearch of the inspiration and this time he all but found it
He rose tohis feet looking out and off below him
As from pinnacle Presley from where he now stood dominated theentire country
The sun had begun to set everything in the range of hisvision was overlaid with sheen of gold
First close at hand it was the Seed ranch carpeting the little hollowbehind the Mission with spread of greens some dark some vividsome pale almost to yellowness
Beyond that was the Mission itselfits venerable campanile in whose arches hung the Spanish Kings bellsalready glowing ruddy in the sunset
Farther on he could make outAnnixters ranch house marked by the skeletonlike tower of theartesian well and little farther to the east the huddled tiledroofs of Guadalajara
Far to the west and north he saw Bonneville veryplain and the dome of the courthouse purple silhouette against theglare of the sky
Other points detached themselves swimming in goldenmist projecting blue shadows far before them the mammoth liveoak byHoovens towering superb and magnificent the line of eucalyptus treesbehind which he knew was the Los Muertos ranch househis home thewateringtank the great ironhooped tower of wood that stood at thejoining of the Lower Road and the County Road the long windbreak ofpoplar trees and the white walls of Carahers saloon on the County Road
But all this seemed to be only foreground mere array ofaccessoriesa mass of irrelevant details
Beyond Annixters beyondGuadalajara beyond the Lower Road beyond Broderson Creek on to thesouth and west infinite illimitable stretching out there under thesheen of the sunset forever and forever flat vast unbroken hugescroll unrolling between the horizons spread the great stretches ofthe ranch of Los Muertos bare of crops shaved close in the recentharvest
Near at hand were hills but on that far southern horizon onlythe curve of the great earth itself checked the view
Adjoining LosMuertos and widening to the west opened the Broderson ranch
TheOsterman ranch to the northwest carried on the great sweep of landscaperanch after ranch
Then as the imagination itself expanded under thestimulus of that measureless range of vision even those great ranchesresolved themselves into mere foreground mere accessories irrelevantdetails
Beyond the fine line of the horizons over the curve of theglobe the shoulder of the earth were other ranches equally vast andbeyond these others and beyond these still others the immensitiesmultiplying lengthening out vaster and vaster
The whole giganticsweep of the San Joaquin expanded Titanic before the eye of the mindflagellated with heat quivering and shimmering under the suns red eye
At long intervals faint breath of wind out of the south passed slowlyover the levels of the baked and empty earth accentuating the silencemarking off the stillness
It seemed to exhale from the land itself aprolonged sigh as of deep fatigue
It was the season after the harvestand the great earth the mother after its period of reproduction itspains of labour delivered of the fruit of its loins slept the sleepof exhaustion the infinite repose of the colossus benignant eternalstrong the nourisher of nations the feeder of an entire world
there it was his epic his inspiration his West his thunderingprogression of hexameters
sudden uplift sense of exhilaration ofphysical exaltation appeared abruptly to sweep Presley from his feet
Asfrom point high above the world he seemed to dominate universe awhole order of things
He was dizzied stunned stupefied his morbidsupersensitive mind reeling drunk with the intoxication of mereimmensity
Stupendous ideas for which there were no names drove headlongthrough his brain
Terrible formless shapes vague figures giganticmonstrous distorted whirled at gallop through his imagination
He started homeward still in his dream descending from the hillemerging from the canyon and took the short cut straight across theQuien Sabe ranch leaving Guadalajara far to his left
He trampedsteadily on through the wheat stubble walking fast his head in awhirl
Never had he so nearly grasped his inspiration as at that moment on thehilltop
Even now though the sunset was fading though the wide reachof valley was shut from sight it still kept him company
Now thedetails came thronging backthe component parts of his poem the signsand symbols of the West
It was there close at hand he had been intouch with it all day
It was in the centenarians vividly colouredreminiscencesDe La Cuesta holding his grant from the Spanish crownwith his power of life and death the romance of his marriage the whitehorse with its pillion of red leather and silver bridle mountings thebullfights in the Plaza the gifts of gold dust and horses and tallow

It was in Vanamees flight into the wilderness the story of the LongTrail the sunsets behind the altarlike mesas the baking desolation ofthe deserts the strenuous fierce life of forgotten towns down therefar off lost below the horizons of the southwest the sonorous music ofunfamiliar namesQuijotoa Uintah Sonora Laredo Uncompahgre
Itwas in the Mission with its cracked bells its decaying walls itsvenerable sun dial its fountain and old garden and in the MissionFathers themselves the priests the padres planting the first wheatand oil and wine to produce the elements of the Sacramenta trinity ofgreat industries taking their rise in religious rite
Abruptly as if in confirmation Presley heard the sound of bell fromthe direction of the Mission itself
It was the de Profundis noteof the Old World of the ancient regime an echo from the hillsidesof mediaeval Europe sounding there in this new land unfamiliar andstrange at this endofthecentury time
By now however it was dark
Presley hurried forward
He came to theline fence of the Quien Sabe ranch
Everything was very still
The starswere all out
There was not sound other than the de Profundis stillsounding from very far away
At long intervals the great earth sigheddreamily in its sleep
All about the feeling of absolute peaceand quiet and security and untroubled happiness and content seemeddescending from the stars like benediction
The beauty of his poemits idyl came to him like caress that alone had been lacking
It wasthat perhaps which had left it hitherto incomplete
At last he wasto grasp his song in all its entity
But suddenly there was aninterruption
Presley had climbed the fence at the limit of theQuien Sabe ranch
Beyond was Los Muertos but between the two ran therailroad
He had only time to jump back upon the embankment when witha quivering of all the earth locomotive single unattached shotby him with roar filling the air with the reek of hot oil vomitingsmoke and sparks its enormous eye cyclopean red throwing glare farin advance shooting by in sudden crash of confused thunder fillingthe night with the terrific clamour of its iron hoofs
Abruptly Presley remembered
This must be the crack passenger engineof which Dyke had told him the one delayed by the accident on theBakersfield division and for whose passage the track had been opened allthe way to Fresno
Before Presley could recover from the shock of the irruption while theearth was still vibrating the rails still humming the engine was faraway flinging the echo of its frantic gallop over all the valley
For abrief instant it roared with hollow diapason on the Long Trestle overBroderson Creek then plunged into cutting farther on the quiveringglare of its fires losing itself in the night its thunder abruptlydiminishing to subdued and distant humming
All at once this ceased
The engine was gone
But the moment the noise of the engine lapsed Presleyabout to startforward againwas conscious of confusion of lamentable sounds thatrose into the night from out the engines wake
Prolonged cries ofagony sobbing wails of infinite pain heartrending pitiful
The noises came from little distance
He ran down the track crossingthe culvert over the irrigating ditch and at the head of the longreach of trackbetween the culvert and the Long Trestlepausedabruptly held immovable at the sight of the ground and rails all abouthim
In some way the herd of sheepVanamees herdhad found breach inthe wire fence by the right of way and had wandered out upon the tracks
band had been crossing just at the moment of the engines passage
Thepathos of it was beyond expression
It was slaughter massacre ofinnocents
The iron monster had charged full into the midst mercilessinexorable
To the right and left all the width of the right of waythe little bodies had been flung backs were snapped against the fenceposts brains knocked out
Caught in the barbs of the wire wedged inthe bodies hung suspended
Under foot it was terrible
The black bloodwinking in the starlight seeped down into the clinkers between the tieswith prolonged sucking murmur
Presley turned away horrorstruck sick at heart overwhelmed with aquick burst of irresistible compassion for this brute agony he could notrelieve
The sweetness was gone from the evening the sense of peaceof security and placid contentment was stricken from the landscape
Thehideous ruin in the engines path drove all thought of his poem from hismind
The inspiration vanished like mist
The de Profundis had ceasedto ring
He hurried on across the Los Muertos ranch almost running even puttinghis hands over his ears till he was out of hearing distance of thatall but human distress
Not until he was beyond earshot did he pauselooking back listening
The night had shut down again
For moment thesilence was profound unbroken
Then faint and prolonged across the levels of the ranch he heard theengine whistling for Bonneville
Again and again at rapid intervals inits flying course it whistled for road crossings for sharp curves fortrestles ominous notes hoarse bellowing ringing with the accents ofmenace and defiance and abruptly Presley saw again in his imaginationthe galloping monster the terror of steel and steam with its singleeye cyclopean red shooting from horizon to horizon but saw it nowas the symbol of vast power huge terrible flinging the echo ofits thunder over all the reaches of the valley leaving blood anddestruction in its path the leviathan with tentacles of steelclutching into the soil the soulless Force the ironhearted Power themonster the Colossus the Octopus
CHAPTER IIOn the following morning Harran Derrick was up and about by littleafter six oclock and quarter of an hour later had breakfast in thekitchen of the ranch house preferring not to wait until the Chinesecook laid the table in the regular diningroom
He scented harddays work ahead of him and was anxious to be at it betimes
He waspractically the manager of Los Muertos and with the aid of his foremanand three division superintendents carried forward nearly the entiredirection of the ranch occupying himself with the details of hisfathers plans executing his orders signing contracts paying billsand keeping the books
For the last three weeks little had been done
The cropsuch asit washad been harvested and sold and there had been generalrelaxation of activity for upwards of month
Now however the fallwas coming on the dry season was about at its end any time after thetwentieth of the month the first rains might be expected softening theground putting it into condition for the plough
Two days before thisHarran had notified his superintendents on Three and Four to send insuch grain as they had reserved for seed
On Two the wheat had not evenshown itself above the ground while on One the Home ranch which wasunder his own immediate supervision the seed had already been gradedand selected
It was Harrans intention to commence bluestoning his seed that day adelicate and important process which prevented rust and smut appearingin the crop when the wheat should come up
But furthermore he wantedto find time to go to Guadalajara to meet the Governor on the morningtrain
His day promised to be busy
But as Harran was finishing his last cup of coffee Phelps the foremanon the Home ranch who also looked after the storage barns where theseed was kept presented himself cap in hand on the back porch by thekitchen door
thought Id speak to you about the seed from Four sir he said
That hasnt been brought in yetHarran nodded
Ill see about it
Youve got all the bluestone you want have youPhelps and without waiting for an answer he added Tell the stablemanI shall want the team about nine oclock to go to Guadalajara
Put themin the buggy
The bays you understand When the other had goneHarran drank off the rest of his coffee and rising passed through thediningroom and across stonepaved hallway with glass roof into theoffice just beyond
The office was the nervecentre of the entire ten thousand acres ofLos Muertos but its appearance and furnishings were not in the leastsuggestive of farm
It was divided at about its middle by wirerailing painted green and gold and behind this railing were thehigh desks where the books were kept the safe the letterpress andletterfiles and Harrans typewriting machine
great map of LosMuertos with every watercourse depression and elevation togetherwith indications of the varying depths of the clays and loams in thesoil accurately plotted hung against the wall between the windowswhile near at hand by the safe was the telephone
But no doubt the most significant object in the office was theticker
This was an innovation in the San Joaquin an idea of shrewdquickwitted young Annixter which Harran and Magnus Derrick had beenquick to adopt and after them Broderson and Osterman and many othersof the wheat growers of the county
The offices of the ranches werethus connected by wire with San Francisco and through that city withMinneapolis Duluth Chicago New York and at last and most importantof all with Liverpool
Fluctuations in the price of the worlds cropduring and after the harvest thrilled straight to the office of LosMuertos to that of the Quien Sabe to Ostermans and to Brodersons
During flurry in the Chicago wheat pits in the August of that yearwhich had affected even the San Francisco market Harran and Magnus hadsat up nearly half of one night watching the strip of white tape jerkingunsteadily from the reel
At such moments they no longer felt theirindividuality
The ranch became merely the part of an enormous wholea unit in the vast agglomeration of wheat land the whole world roundfeeling the effects of causes thousands of miles distanta drought onthe prairies of Dakota rain on the plains of India frost on theRussian steppes hot wind on the llanos of the Argentine
Harran crossed over to the telephone and rang six bells the call forthe division house on Four
It was the most distant the most isolatedpoint on all the ranch situated at its far southeastern extremitywhere few people ever went close to the line fence dot specklost in the immensity of the open country
By the road it was elevenmiles distant from the office and by the trail to Hoovens and theLower Road all of nine
How about that seed demanded Harran when he had got Cutter on theline
The other made excuses for an unavoidable delay and was adding that hewas on the point of starting out when Harran cut in withYou had better go the trail
It will save little time and am ina hurry
Put your sacks on the horses backs
And Cutter if you seeHooven when you go by his place tell him want him and by the waytake look at the end of the irrigating ditch when you get to it
Seehow they are getting along there and if Billy wants anything
Tell himwe are expecting those new scoops down tomorrow or next day and to getalong with what he has until then Hows everything on Four
All right then
Give your seed to Phelps when you get here if am notabout
am going to Guadalajara to meet the Governor
Hes coming downtoday
And that makes me think we lost the case you know
had aletter from the Governor yesterday
Yes hard luck
Behrman didus up
Well goodbye and dont lose any time with that seed
want tobluestone todayAfter telephoning Cutter Harran put on his hat went over to the barnsand found Phelps
Phelps had already cleaned out the vat which was tocontain the solution of bluestone and was now at work regrading theseed
Against the wall behind him ranged the row of sacks
Harran cutthe fastenings of these and examined the contents carefully takinghandfuls of wheat from each and allowing it to run through his fingersor nipping the grains between his nails testing their hardness
The seed was all of the white varieties of wheat and of very highgrade the berries hard and heavy rigid and swollen with starch
If it was all like that sir hey observed Phelps
Harran put his chin in the air
Bread would be as good as cake then he answered going from sackto sack inspecting the contents and consulting the tags affixed to themouths
Hello he remarked heres red wheat
Where did this come fromThats that red Clawson we sowed to the piece on Four north theMission Creek just to see how it would do here
We didnt get verygood catchWe cant do better than to stay by White Sonora and Propo remarkedHarran
Weve got our best results with that and European millers likeit to mix with the Eastern wheats that have more gluten than ours
Thatis if we have any wheat at all next yearA feeling of discouragement for the moment bore down heavily upon him
At intervals this came to him and for the moment it was overpowering
The idea of whatstheuse was upon occasion veritable oppression
Everything seemed to combine to lower the price of wheat
The extensionof wheat areas always exceeded increase of population competition wasgrowing fiercer every year
The farmers profits were the object ofattack from score of different quarters
It was flock of vulturesdescending upon common preythe commission merchant the elevatorcombine the mixinghouse ring the banks the warehouse men thelabouring man and above all the railroad
Steadily the Liverpoolbuyers cut and cut and cut
Everything every element of the worldsmarkets tended to force down the price to the lowest possible figure atwhich it could be profitably farmed
Now it was down to eightyseven
It was at that figure the crop had sold that year and to think that theGovernor had seen wheat at two dollars and five cents in the year of theTurkoRussian War
He turned back to the house after giving Phelps final directionsgloomy disheartened his hands deep in his pockets wondering what wasto be the outcome
So narrow had the margin of profit shrunk that adry season meant bankruptcy to the smaller farmers throughout all thevalley
He knew very well how widespread had been the distress the lasttwo years
With their own tenants on Los Muertos affairs had reachedthe stage of desperation
Derrick had practically been obliged tocarry Hooven and some of the others
The Governor himself had madealmost nothing during the last season third year like the last withthe price steadily sagging meant nothing else but ruin
But here he checked himself
Two consecutive dry seasons in Californiawere almost unprecedented third would be beyond belief and thecomplete rest for nearly all the land was compensation
They hadmade no money that was true but they had lost none
Thank God thehomestead was free of mortgage one good season would more than make upthe difference
He was in better mood by the time he reached the driveway that led upto the ranch house and as he raised his eyes toward the house itselfhe could not but feel that the sight of his home was cheering
The ranchhouse was set in great grove of eucalyptus oak and cypress enormoustrees growing from out lawn that was as green as fresh and aswellgroomed as any in garden in the city
This lawn flanked all oneside of the house and it was on this side that the family elected tospend most of its time
The other side looking out upon the Home ranchtoward Bonneville and the railroad was but little used
deep porchran the whole length of the house here and in the lower branches of aliveoak near the steps Harran had built little summer house for hismother
To the left of the ranch house itself toward the County Roadwas the bunkhouse and kitchen for some of the hands
From the steps ofthe porch the view to the southward expanded to infinity
There was notso much as twig to obstruct the view
In one leap the eye reachedthe fine delicate line where earth and sky met miles away
The flatmonotony of the land clean of fencing was broken by one spot only theroof of the Division Superintendents house on Threea mere speck justdarker than the ground
Cutters house on Four was not even in sight
That was below the horizon
As Harran came up he saw his mother at breakfast
The table had been seton the porch and Mrs Derrick stirring her coffee with one hand heldopen with the other the pages of Walter Paters Marius At her feetPrincess Nathalie the white Angora cat sleek overfed selfcentredsat on her haunches industriously licking at the white fur of herbreast while near at hand by the railing of the porch Presleypottered with new bicycle lamp filling it with oil adjusting thewicks
Harran kissed his mother and sat down in wicker chair on the porchremoving his hat running his fingers through his yellow hair
Magnus Derricks wife looked hardly old enough to be the mother of twosuch big fellows as Harran and Lyman Derrick
She was not far into thefifties and her brown hair still retained much of its brightness
Shecould yet be called pretty
Her eyes were large and easily assumed alook of inquiry and innocence such as one might expect to see in ayoung girl
By disposition she was retiring she easily obliteratedherself
She was not made for the harshness of the world and yet shehad known these harshnesses in her younger days
Magnus had married herwhen she was twentyone years old at time when she was graduateof some years standing from the State Normal School and was teachingliterature music and penmanship in seminary in the town ofMarysville
She overworked herself here continually loathing the strainof teaching yet clinging to it with tenacity born of the knowledgethat it was her only means of support
Both her parents were dead shewas dependent upon herself
Her one ambition was to see Italy andthe Bay of Naples
The Marble Faun Raphaels Madonnas and IlTrovatore were her beau ideals of literature and art
She dreamed ofItaly Rome Naples and the worlds great artcentres There was nodoubt that her affair with Magnus had been lovematch but Annie Paynewould have loved any man who would have taken her out of the droningheartbreaking routine of the class and music room
She had followed hisfortunes unquestioningly
First at Sacramento during the turmoil ofhis political career later on at Placerville in El Dorado County afterDerrick had interested himself in the Corpus Christi group of mines andfinally at Los Muertos where after selling out his fourth interestin Corpus Christi he had turned rancher and had come in on the newtracts of wheat land just thrown open by the railroad
She had livedhere now for nearly ten years
But never for one moment since the timeher glance first lost itself in the unbroken immensity of the rancheshad she known moments content
Continually there came into herpretty wideopen eyesthe eyes of young doea look of uneasinessof distrust and aversion
Los Muertos frightened her
She rememberedthe days of her young girlhood passed on farm in eastern Ohiofivehundred acres neatly partitioned into the water lot the cow pasturethe corn lot the barley field and wheat farm cosey comfortablehomelike where the farmers loved their land caressing it coaxing itnourishing it as though it were thing almost conscious where the seedwas sown by hand and single twohorse plough was sufficient for theentire farm where the scythe sufficed to cut the harvest and the grainwas thrashed with flails
But this new order of thingsa ranch bounded only by the horizonswhere as far as one could see to the north to the east to the southand to the west was all one holding principality ruled with iron andsteam bullied into yield of three hundred and fifty thousand bushelswhere even when the land was resting unploughed unharrowed andunsown the wheat came uptroubled her and even at times filled herwith an undefinable terror
To her mind there was something inordinateabout it all something almost unnatural
The direct brutality of tenthousand acres of wheat nothing but wheat as far as the eye could seestunned her little
The onetime writingteacher of young ladiesseminary with her pretty deerlike eyes and delicate fingers shrankfrom it
She did not want to look at so much wheat
There was somethingvaguely indecent in the sight this food of the people this elementalforce this basic energy weltering here under the sun in all theunconscious nakedness of sprawling primordial Titan
The monotony of the ranch ate into her heart hour by hour year by year
And with it all when was she to see Rome Italy and the Bay of Naples
It was different prospect truly
Magnus had given her his promisethat once the ranch was well established they two should travel
Butcontinually he had been obliged to put her off now for one reason nowfor another the machine would not as yet run of itself he must stillfeel his hand upon the lever next year perhaps when wheat should goto ninety or the rains were good
She did not insist
She obliteratedherself only allowing from time to time her pretty questioning eyesto meet his
In the meantime she retired within herself
She surroundedherself with books
Her taste was of the delicacy of point lace
Sheknew her Austin Dobson by heart
She read poems essays the ideasof the seminary at Marysville persisting in her mind
Marius theEpicurean The Essays of Elia Sesame and Lilies The Stones ofVenice and the little toy magazines full of the flaccid banalities ofthe Minor Poets were continually in her hands
When Presley had appeared on Los Muertos she had welcomed his arrivalwith delight
Here at last was congenial spirit
She looked forwardto long conversations with the young man on literature art and ethics
But Presley had disappointed her
That heoutside of his few chosendeitiesshould care little for literature shocked her beyond words
His indifference to style to elegant English was positive affront
His savage abuse and open ridicule of the neatly phrased rondeaux andsestinas and chansonettes of the little magazines was to her minda wanton and uncalledfor cruelty
She found his Homer with itsslaughters and hecatombs and barbaric feastings and headstrong passionsviolent and coarse
She could not see with him any romance any poetryin the life around her she looked to Italy for that
His Song of theWest which only once incoherent and fierce he had tried to explainto her its swift tumultous life its truth its nobility and savageryits heroism and obscenity had revolted her
But Presley she had murmured that is not literatureNo he had cried between his teeth no thank God it is notA little later one of the stablemen brought the buggy with the team ofbays up to the steps of the porch and Harran putting on differentcoat and black hat took himself off to Guadalajara
The morning wasfine there was no cloud in the sky but as Harrans buggy drew awayfrom the grove of trees about the ranch house emerging into the opencountry on either side of the Lower Road he caught himself lookingsharply at the sky and the faint line of hills beyond the Quien Saberanch
There was certain indefinite cast to the landscape that toHarrans eye was not to be mistaken
Rain the first of the season wasnot far off
Thats good he muttered touching the bays with the whip we cantget our ploughs to hand any too soonThese ploughs Magnus Derrick had ordered from an Eastern manufacturersome months before since he was dissatisfied with the results obtainedfrom the ones he had used hitherto which were of local make
Howeverthere had been exasperating and unexpected delays in their shipment
Magnus and Harran both had counted upon having the ploughs in theirimplement barns that very week but tracer sent after them had onlyresulted in locating them still en route somewhere between The Needlesand Bakersfield
Now there was likelihood of rain within the week
Ploughing could be undertaken immediately afterward so soon as theground was softened but there was fair chance that the ranch wouldlie idle for want of proper machinery
It was ten minutes before train time when Harran reached the depot atGuadalajara
The San Francisco papers of the preceding day had arrivedon an earlier train
He bought couple from the station agent andlooked them over till distant and prolonged whistle announced theapproach of the down train
In one of the four passengers that alighted from the train herecognised his father
He half rose in his seat whistling shrillybetween his teeth waving his hand and Magnus Derrick catching sightof him came forward quickly
Magnusthe Governorwas all of six feet tall and though now welltoward his sixtieth year was as erect as an officer of cavalry
He wasbroad in proportion fine commanding figure imposing an immediaterespect impressing one with sense of gravity of dignity and acertain pride of race
He was smoothshaven thinlipped with abroad chin and prominent hawklike nosethe characteristic ofthe familythin with high bridge such as one sees in the laterportraits of the Duke of Wellington
His hair was thick and irongreyand had tendency to curl in forward direction just in front of hisears
He wore tophat of grey with wide brim and frock coat andcarried cane with yellowed ivory head
As young man it had been his ambition to represent his nativeStateNorth Carolinain the United States Senate
Calhoun was hisgreat man but in two successive campaigns he had been defeated
His career checked in this direction he had come to California in thefifties
He had known and had been the intimate friend of such men asTerry Broderick General Baker Lick Alvarado Emerich Larkin andabove all of the unfortunate and misunderstood Ralston
Once he hadbeen put forward as the Democratic candidate for governor but failedof election
After this Magnus had definitely abandoned politics and hadinvested all his money in the Corpus Christi mines
Then he had soldout his interest at small profitjust in time to miss his chance ofbecoming multimillionaire in the Comstock boomand was lookingfor reinvestments in other lines when the news that wheat had beendiscovered in California was passed from mouth to mouth
Practicallyit amounted to discovery
Dr Glenns first harvest of wheat inColusa County quietly undertaken but suddenly realised with dramaticabruptness gave new matter for reflection to the thinking men of theNew West
California suddenly leaped unheralded into the worlds marketas competitor in wheat production
In few years her output of wheatexceeded the value of her output of gold and when later on thePacific and Southwestern Railroad threw open to settlers the rich landsof Tulare Countyconceded to the corporation by the government as abonus for the construction of the roadMagnus had been quick to seizethe opportunity and had taken up the ten thousand acres of Los Muertos
Wherever he had gone Magnus had taken his family with him
Lyman hadbeen born at Sacramento during the turmoil and excitement of Derrickscampaign for governor and Harran at Shingle Springs in El DoradoCounty six years later
But Magnus was in every sense the prominent man In whatever circle hemoved he was the chief figure
Instinctively other men looked to himas the leader
He himself was proud of this distinction he assumed thegrand manner very easily and carried it well
As public speaker he wasone of the last of the followers of the old school of orators
He evencarried the diction and manner of the rostrum into private life
It wassaid of him that his most colloquial conversation could be taken downin shorthand and read off as an admirable specimen of pure wellchosenEnglish
He loved to do things upon grand scale to preside todominate
In his good humour there was something Jovian
When angryeverybody around him trembled
But he had not the genius for detailwas not patient
The certain grandiose lavishness of his dispositionoccupied itself more with results than with means
He was always readyto take chances to hazard everything on the hopes of colossal returns
In the mining days at Placerville there was no more redoubtable pokerplayer in the county
He had been as lucky in his mines as in hisgambling sinking shafts and tunnelling in violation of expert theoryand finding pay in every case
Without knowing it he allowed himselfto work his ranch much as if he was still working his mine
Theoldtime spirit of haphazard unscientific persisted in his mind
Everything was gamblewho took the greatest chances was most apt tobe the greatest winner
The idea of manuring Los Muertos of husbandinghis great resources he would have scouted as niggardly Hebraicungenerous
Magnus climbed into the buggy helping himself with Harransoutstretched hand which he still held
The two were immensely fondof each other proud of each other
They were constantly together andMagnus kept no secrets from his favourite son
Well boyWell GovernorI am very pleased you came yourself Harran
feared that you might betoo busy and send Phelps
It was thoughtfulHarran was about to reply but at that moment Magnus caught sight of thethree flat cars loaded with brightpainted farming machines which stillremained on the siding above the station
He laid his hands on the reinsand Harran checked the team
Harran observed Magnus fixing the machinery with judicial frownHarran those look singularly like our ploughs
Drive over boyThe train had by this time gone on its way and Harran brought the teamup to the siding
Ah was right said the Governor
Magnus Derrick Los MuertosBonneville from Ditson Co Rochester
These are ours boyHarran breathed sigh of relief
At last he answered and just in time too
Well have rain beforethe week is out
think now that am here will telephone Phelps tosend the wagon right down for these
started bluestoning todayMagnus nodded grave approval
That was shrewd boy
As to the rain think you are well informed wewill have an early season
The ploughs have arrived at happy momentIt means money to us Governor remarked Harran
But as he turned the horses to allow his father to get into the buggyagain the two were surprised to hear thick throaty voice wishingthem goodmorning and turning about were aware of Behrman who hadcome up while they were examining the ploughs
Harrans eyes flashedon the instant and through his nostrils he drew sharp quick breathwhile certain rigour of carriage stiffened the set of Magnus Derricksshoulders and back
Magnus had not yet got into the buggy but stoodwith the team between him and Behrman eyeing him calmly across thehorses backs
Behrman came around to the other side of the buggy andfaced Magnus
He was large fat man with great stomach his cheek and the upperpart of his thick neck ran together to form great tremulous jowlshaven and bluegrey in colour roll of fat sprinkled with sparsehair moist with perspiration protruded over the back of his collar
He wore heavy black moustache
On his head was roundtopped hat ofstiff brown straw highly varnished
lightbrown linen vest stampedwith innumerable interlocked horseshoes covered his protuberantstomach upon which heavy watch chain of hollow links rose and fellwith his difficult breathing clinking against the vest buttons ofimitation motherofpearl
Behrman was the banker of Bonneville
But besides this he was manyother things
He was real estate agent
He bought grain he dealt inmortgages
He was one of the local political bosses but more importantthan all this he was the representative of the Pacific and SouthwesternRailroad in that section of Tulare County
The railroad did littlebusiness in that part of the country that Behrman did not supervisefrom the consignment of shipment of wheat to the management of adamage suit or even to the repair and maintenance of the right ofway
During the time when the ranchers of the county were fighting thegrainrate case Behrman had been much in evidence in and aboutthe San Francisco court rooms and the lobby of the legislature inSacramento
He had returned to Bonneville only recently decisionadverse to the ranchers being foreseen
The position he occupied onthe salary list of the Pacific and Southwestern could not readily bedefined for he was neither freight agent passenger agent attorneyrealestate broker nor political servant though his influence in allthese offices was undoubted and enormous
But for all that the ranchersabout Bonneville knew whom to look to as source of trouble
There wasno denying the fact that for Osterman Broderson Annixter and DerrickS Behrman was the railroad
Derrick goodmorning he cried as he came up
Glad to see you back Mr Derrick He held out thick hand
Magnus head and shoulders above the other tall thin erect lookeddown upon Behrman inclining his head failing to see his extendedhand
Goodmorning sir he observed and waited for Behrmans furtherspeech
Well Mr Derrick continued Behrman wiping the back of his neckwith his handkerchief saw in the city papers yesterday that our casehad gone against youI guess it wasnt any great news to YOU commented Harran his facescarlet
guess you knew which way Ulsteen was going to jump afteryour very first interview with him
You dont like to be surprised inthis sort of thing BehrmanNow you know better than that Harran remonstrated Behrmanblandly
know what you mean to imply but aint going to let itmake me get mad
wanted to say to your GovernorI wanted to say toyou Mr Derrickas one man to anotherletting alone for the minutethat we were on opposite sides of the casethat Im sorry you didntwin
Your side made good fight but it was in mistaken cause
Thatsthe whole trouble
Why you could have figured out before you ever wentinto the case that such rates are confiscation of property
You mustallow usmust allow the railroada fair interest on the investment
You dont want us to go into the receivers hands do you now MrDerrickThe Board of Railroad Commissioners was bought remarked Magnussharply keen brisk flash glinting in his eye
It was part of the game put in Harran for the Railroad Commissionto cut rates to ridiculous figure far below REASONABLE figure justso that it WOULD be confiscation
Whether Ulsteen is tool of yours ornot he had to put the rates back to what they were originallyIf you enforced those rates Mr Harran returned Behrman calmlywe wouldnt be able to earn sufficient money to meet operatingexpenses or fixed charges to say nothing of surplus left over to paydividendsTell me when the and ever paid dividendsThe lowest rates continued Behrman that the legislaturecan establish must be such as will secure us fair interest on ourinvestmentWell whats your standard
Come lets hear it
Who is to say whats afair rate
The railroad has its own notions of fairness sometimesThe laws of the State returned Behrman fix the rate of interestat seven per cent
Thats good enough standard for us
There is noreason Mr Harran why dollar invested in railroad should not earnas much as dollar represented by promissory noteseven per cent
By applying your schedule of rates we would not earn cent we would bebankruptInterest on your investment cried Harran furious
Its fine to talkabout fair interest
know and you know that the total earnings of theP and Wtheir main branch and leased lines for last yearwasbetween nineteen and twenty millions of dollars
Do you mean to say thattwenty million dollars is seven per cent
of the original cost of theroadS Behrman spread out his hands smiling
That was the gross not the net figureand how can you tell what wasthe original cost of the road Ah thats just it shouted Harranemphasising each word with blow of his fist upon his knee his eyessparkling you take cursed good care that we dont know anything aboutthe original cost of the road
But we know you are bonded for trebleyour value and we know this that the road COULD have been builtfor fiftyfour thousand dollars per mile and that you SAY it cost youeightyseven thousand
It makes difference Behrman on which ofthese two figures you are basing your seven per centThat all may show obstinacy Harran observed Behrman vaguely butit dont show common senseWe are threshing out old straw believe gentlemen remarked Magnus
The question was thoroughly sifted in the courtsQuite right assented Behrman
The best way is that the railroadand the farmer understand each other and get along peaceably
We areboth dependent on each other
Your ploughs believe Mr Derrick SBehrman nodded toward the flat cars
They are consigned to me admitted Magnus
It looks trifle like rain observed Behrman easing his neck andjowl in his limp collar
suppose you will want to begin ploughingnext weekPossibly said Magnus
Ill see that your ploughs are hurried through for you then MrDerrick
We will route them by fast freight for you and it wont costyou anything extraWhat do you mean demanded Harran
The ploughs are here
We havenothing more to do with the railroad
am going to have my wagons downhere this afternoonI am sorry answered Behrman but the cars are going northnot as you thought coming FROM the north
They have not been to SanFrancisco yetMagnus made slight movement of the head as one who remembers facthitherto forgotten
But Harran was as yet unenlightened
To San Francisco he answered we want them herewhat are youtalking aboutWell you know of course the regulations answered Behrman
Freight of this kind coming from the Eastern points into the State mustgo first to one of our common points and be reshipped from thereHarran did remember now but never before had the matter so struckhome
He leaned back in his seat in dumb amazement for the instant
Even Magnus had turned little pale
Then abruptly Harran broke outviolent and raging
What next
My God why dont you break into our houses at night
Whydont you steal the watch out of my pocket steal the horses out of theharness hold us up with shotgun yes stand and deliver your moneyor your life
Here we bring our ploughs from the East over your linesbut youre not content with your longhaul rate between Eastern pointsand Bonneville
You want to get us under your ruinous shorthaul ratebetween Bonneville and San Francisco AND RETURN
Think of it
Heres aload of stuff for Bonneville that cant stop at Bonneville where itis consigned but has got to go up to San Francisco first BY WAY OFBonneville at forty cents per ton and then be reshipped from SanFrancisco back to Bonneville again at FIFTYONE cents per ton theshorthaul rate
And we have to pay it all or go without
Here are theploughs right here in sight of the land they have got to be usedon the season just ready for them and we cant touch them
Oh heexclaimed in deep disgust isnt it pretty mess
Isnt it farce
the whole dirty businessS Behrman listened to him unmoved his little eyes blinking under hisfat forehead the gold chain of hollow links clicking against the pearlbuttons of his waistcoat as he breathed
It dont do any good to let loose like that Harran he said atlength
am willing to do what can for you
Ill hurry the ploughsthrough but cant change the freight regulation of the roadWhats your blackmail for this vociferated Harran
How much do youwant to let us go
How much have we got to pay you to be ALLOWED to useour own ploughswhats your figure
Come spit it outI see you are trying to make me angry Harran returned Behrmanbut you wont succeed
Better give up trying my boy
As said thebest way is to have the railroad and the farmer get along amicably
Itis the only way we can do business
Well slong Governor must trotalong
Slong Harran He took himself off
But before leaving Guadalajara Magnus dropped into the towns smallgrocery store to purchase box of cigars of certain Mexican brandunprocurable elsewhere
Harran remained in the buggy
While he waited Dyke appeared at the end of the street and seeingDerricks younger son came over to shake hands with him
He explainedhis affair with the and and asked the young man what hethought of the expected rise in the price of hops
Hops ought to be good thing Harran told him
The crop in Germanyand in New York has been dead failure for the last three years andso many people have gone out of the business that theres likely to be ashortage and stiff advance in the price
They ought to go to dollarnext year
Sure hops ought to be good thing
Hows the old lady andSidney DykeWhy fairly well thank you Harran
Theyre up to Sacramento just nowto see my brother
was thinking of going in with my brother into thishop business
But had letter from him this morning
He may not beable to meet me on this proposition
Hes got other business on hand
Ifhe pulls outand he probably willIll have to go it alone but Illhave to borrow
had thought with his money and mine we would haveenough to pull off the affair without mortgaging anything
As it is Iguess Ill have to see BehrmanIll be cursed if would exclaimed Harran
Well Behrman is screw admitted the engineer and he israilroad to his boots but business is business and he would have tostand by contract in black and white and this chance in hops is toogood to let slide
guess well try it on Harran
can get goodforeman that knows all about hops just now and if the deal payswellI want to send Sid to seminary up in San FranciscoWell mortgage the crops but dont mortgage the homestead Dyke saidHarran
And by the way have you looked up the freight rates on hopsNo havent yet answered Dyke and had better be sure of thathadnt
hear that the rate is reasonable thoughYou be sure to have clear understanding with the railroad first aboutthe rate Harran warned him
When Magnus came out of the grocery store and once more seated himselfin the buggy he said to Harran Boy drive over here to Annixtersbefore we start home
want to ask him to dine with us tonight
Osterman and Broderson are to drop in believe and should like tohave Annixter as wellMagnus was lavishly hospitable
Los Muertoss doors invariably stoodopen to all the Derricks neighbours and once in so often Magnus had afew of his intimates to dinner
As Harran and his father drove along the road toward Annixters ranchhouse Magnus asked about what had happened during his absence
He inquired after his wife and the ranch commenting upon the work onthe irrigating ditch
Harran gave him the news of the past week Dykesdischarge his resolve to raise crop of hops Vanamees return thekilling of the sheep and Hoovens petition to remain upon the ranch asMagnuss tenant
It needed only Harrans recommendation that the Germanshould remain to have Magnus consent upon the instant
You know moreabout it than boy he said and whatever you think is wise shall bedoneHarran touched the bays with the whip urging them to their briskestpace
They were not yet at Annixters and he was anxious to get back tothe ranch house to supervise the bluestoning of his seed
By the way Governor he demanded suddenly how is Lyman getting onLyman Magnuss eldest son had never taken kindly toward ranch life
Heresembled his mother more than he did Magnus and had inherited from hera distaste for agriculture and tendency toward profession
At timewhen Harran was learning the rudiments of farming Lyman was enteringthe State University and graduating thence had spent three yearsin the study of law
But later on traits that were particularly hisfathers developed
Politics interested him
He told himself he wasa born politician was diplomatic approachable had talent forintrigue gift of making friends easily and most indispensable ofall veritable genius for putting influential men under obligations tohimself
Already he had succeeded in gaining for himself two importantoffices in the municipal administration of San Franciscowhere hehad his homesheriffs attorney and later on assistant districtattorney
But with these small achievements he was by no meanssatisfied
The largeness of his fathers character modified in Lymanby counterinfluence of selfishness had produced in him an inordinateambition
Where his father during his political career had consideredhimself only as an exponent of principles he strove to apply Lyman sawbut the office his own personal aggrandisement
He belonged to the newschool wherein objects were attained not by orations before senatesand assemblies but by sessions of committees caucuses compromisesand expedients
His goal was to be in fact what Magnus was only innamegovernor
Lyman with shut teeth had resolved that some day hewould sit in the gubernatorial chair in Sacramento
Lyman is doing well answered Magnus
could wish he was morepronounced in his convictions less willing to compromise but believehim to be earnest and to have talent for government and civics
Hisambition does him credit and if he occupied himself little more withmeans and little less with ends he would am sure be the idealservant of the people
But am not afraid
The time will come when theState will be proud of himAs Harran turned the team into the driveway that led up to Annixtershouse Magnus remarkedHarran isnt that young Annixter himself on the porchHarran nodded and remarkedBy the way Governor wouldnt seem too cordial in your invitation toAnnixter
He will be glad to come know but if you seem to want himtoo much it is just like his confounded obstinacy to make objectionsThere is something in that observed Magnus as Harran drew up at theporch of the house
He is queer crossgrained fellow but in manyways sterlingAnnixter was lying in the hammock on the porch precisely as Presleyhad found him the day before reading David Copperfield and stuffinghimself with dried prunes
When he recognised Magnus however he gotup though careful to give evidence of the most poignant discomfort
Heexplained his difficulty at great length protesting that his stomachwas no better than spongebag
Would Magnus and Harran get down andhave drink
There was whiskey somewhere about
Magnus however declined
He stated his errand asking Annixter to comeover to Los Muertos that evening for seven oclock dinner
Osterman andBroderson would be there
At once Annixter even to Harrans surprise put his chin in theair making excuses fearing to compromise himself if he accepted tooreadily
No he did not think he could get aroundwas sure of it infact
There were certain businesses he had on hand that evening
He hadpractically made an appointment with man at Bonneville then toohe was thinking of going up to San Francisco tomorrow and needed hissleep would go to bed early and besides all that he was very sickman his stomach was out of whack if he moved about it brought thegripes back
No they must get along without him
Magnus knowing with whom he had to deal did not urge the point beingconvinced that Annixter would argue over the affair the rest of themorning
He resettled himself in the buggy and Harran gathered up thereins
Well he observed you know your business best
Come if you can
Wedine at sevenI hear you are going to farm the whole of Los Muertos this season remarked Annixter with certain note of challenge in his voice
We are thinking of it replied Magnus
Annixter grunted scornfully
Did you get the message sent you by Presley he began
Tactless blunt and direct Annixter was quite capable of calling evenMagnus fool to his face
But before he could proceed Behrman inhis single buggy turned into the gate and driving leisurely up to theporch halted on the other side of Magnuss team
Goodmorning gentlemen he remarked nodding to the two Derricks asthough he had not seen them earlier in the day
Annixter how doyou doWhat in hell do YOU want demanded Annixter with stare
Behrman hiccoughed slightly and passed fat hand over his waistcoat
Why not very much Mr Annixter he replied ignoring thebelligerency in the young ranchmans voice but will have to lodgea protest against you Mr Annixter in the matter of keeping your linefence in repair
The sheep were all over the track last night thisside the Long Trestle and am afraid they have seriously disturbed ourballast along there
Wethe railroadcant fence along our right ofway
The farmers have the prescriptive right of that so we have to lookto you to keep your fence in repair
am sorry but shall have toprotest Annixter returned to the hammock and stretched himself outin it to his full length remarking tranquillyGo to the devilIt is as much to your interest as to ours that the safety of thepublicYou heard what said
Go to the devilThat all may show obstinacy Mr Annixter butSuddenly Annixter jumped up again and came to the edge of the porch hisface flamed scarlet to the roots of his stiff yellow hair
He thrust outhis jaw aggressively clenching his teeth
You he vociferated Ill tell you what you are
Youre aaa PIPTo his mind it was the last insult the most outrageous calumny
He hadno worse epithet at his command
may show obstinacy pursued Behrman bent upon finishing thephrase but it dont show common senseIll mend my fence and then again maybe wont mend my fence shouted Annixter
know what you meanthat wild engine last night
Well youve no right to run at that speed in the town limitsHow the town limits
The sheep were this side the Long TrestleWell thats in the town limits of Guadalajara Why Mr Annixterthe Long Trestle is good two miles out of GuadalajaraAnnixter squared himself leaping to the chance of an argument
Two miles
Its not mile and quarter
No its not mile
Illleave it to Magnus hereOh know nothing about it declared Magnus refusing to be involved
Yes you do
Yes you do too
Any fool knows how far it is fromGuadalajara to the Long Trestle
Its about fiveeighths of mileFrom the depot of the town remarked Behrman placidly to the headof the Long Trestle is about two milesThats lie and you know its lie shouted the other furious atS Behrmans calmness and can prove its lie
Ive walked thatdistance on the Upper Road and know just how fast walk and if Ican walk four miles in one hourMagnus and Harran drove on leaving Annixter trying to draw Behrmaninto wrangle
When at length Behrman as well took himself away Annixter returnedto his hammock finished the rest of his prunes and read another chapterof Copperfield Then he put the book open over his face and went tosleep
An hour later toward noon his own terrific snoring woke him upsuddenly and he sat up rubbing his face and blinking at the sunlight
There was bad taste in his mouth from sleeping with it wide open andgoing into the diningroom of the house he mixed himself drink ofwhiskey and soda and swallowed it in three great gulps
He told himselfthat he felt not only better but hungry and pressed an electric buttonin the wall near the sideboard three times to let the kitchensituatedin separate building near the ranch houseknow that he was ready forhis dinner
As he did so an idea occurred to him
He wondered if HilmaTree would bring up his dinner and wait on the table while he ate it
In connection with his ranch Annixter ran dairy farm on very smallscale making just enough butter and cheese for the consumption of theranchs PERSONNEL
Old man Tree his wife and his daughter Hilma lookedafter the dairy
But there was not always work enough to keep the threeof them occupied and Hilma at times made herself useful in other ways
As often as not she lent hand in the kitchen and two or three timesa week she took her mothers place in looking after Annixters housemaking the beds putting his room to rights bringing his meals upfrom the kitchen
For the last summer she had been away visiting withrelatives in one of the towns on the coast
But the week previous tothis she had returned and Annixter had come upon her suddenly one dayin the dairy making cheese the sleeves of her crisp blue shirt waistrolled back to her very shoulders
Annixter had carried away with him aclearcut recollection of these smooth white arms of hers bare to theshoulder very round and cool and fresh
He would not have believed thata girl so young should have had arms so big and perfect
To his surprisehe found himself thinking of her after he had gone to bed that nightand in the morning when he woke he was bothered to know whether he haddreamed about Hilmas fine white arms over night
Then abruptly hehad lost patience with himself for being so occupied with the subjectraging and furious with all the breed of feemalesa fine way for aman to waste his time
He had had his experience with the timid littlecreature in the glovecleaning establishment in Sacramento
That wasenough
None of them in HIS thank you
HE had seen HilmaTree give him look in the dairy
Aha he saw through her
She wastrying to get hold on him was she
He would show her
Wait tillhe saw her again
He would send her about her business in hurry
Heresolved upon terrible demeanour in the presence of the dairy girlagreat show of indifference fierce masculine nonchalance and whenthe next morning she brought him his breakfast he had been smittendumb as soon as she entered the room glueing his eyes upon hisplate his elbows close to his side awkward clumsy overwhelmed withconstraint
While true to his convictions as womanhater and genuinely despisingHilma both as girl and as an inferior the idea of her worried him
Most of all he was angry with himself because of his inane sheepishnesswhen she was about
He at first had told himself that he was fool notto be able to ignore her existence as hitherto and then that he was agreater fool not to take advantage of his position
Certainly he had notthe remotest idea of any affection but Hilma was fine looking girl
He imagined an affair with her
As he reflected upon the matter now scowling abstractedly at the buttonof the electric bell turning the whole business over in his mind heremembered that today was buttermaking day and that Mrs Tree wouldbe occupied in the dairy
That meant that Hilma would take her place
Heturned to the mirror of the sideboard scrutinising his reflection withgrim disfavour
After moment rubbing the roughened surface of hischin the wrong way he muttered to his image in the glassThat mug
Good Lord
what looking mug Then after momentssilence Wonder if that fool feemale will be up here todayHe crossed over into his bedroom and peeped around the edge of thelowered curtain
The window looked out upon the skeletonlike tower ofthe artesian well and the cookhouse and dairyhouse close beside it
Ashe watched he saw Hilma come out from the cookhouse and hurry acrosstoward the kitchen
Evidently she was going to see about his dinner
But as she passed by the artesian well she met young Delaney one ofAnnixters hands coming up the trail by the irrigating ditch leadinghis horse toward the stables great coil of barbed wire in his glovedhands and pair of nippers thrust into his belt
No doubt he had beenmending the break in the line fence by the Long Trestle
Annixter sawhim take off his widebrimmed hat as he met Hilma and the two stoodthere for some moments talking together
Annixter even heard Hilmalaughing very gayly at something Delaney was saying
She patted hishorses neck affectionately and Delaney drawing the nippers from hisbelt made as if to pinch her arm with them
She caught at his wristand pushed him away laughing again
To Annixters mind the pair seemedastonishingly intimate
Brusquely his anger flamed up
Ah that was it was it
Delaney and Hilma had an understanding betweenthemselves
They carried on their affair right out there in the openunder his very eyes
It was absolutely disgusting
Had they no senseof decency those two
Well this ended it
He would stop that sort ofthing short off none of that on HIS ranch if he knew it
No sir
Hewould pack that girl off before he was day older
He wouldnt havethat kind about the place
Not much
Shed have to get out
He wouldtalk to old man Tree about it this afternoon
Whatever happened HEinsisted upon morality
And my dinner he suddenly exclaimed
Ive got to wait and gohungryand maybe get sick againwhile they carry on their disgustinglovemakingHe turned about on the instant and striding over to the electric bellrang it again with all his might
When that feemale gets up here he declared Ill just find out whyIve got to wait like this
Ill take her down to the Queens taste
Im lenient enough Lord knows but dont propose to be imposed uponALL the timeA few moments later while Annixter was pretending to read the countynewspaper by the window in the diningroom Hilma came in to set thetable
At the time Annixter had his feet cocked on the window ledge andwas smoking cigar but as soon as she entered the room hewithoutpremeditationbrought his feet down to the floor and crushed out thelighted tip of his cigar under the window ledge
Over the top of thepaper he glanced at her covertly from time to time
Though Hilma was only nineteen years old she was large girl withall the development of much older woman
There was certain generousamplitude to the full round curves of her hips and shoulders thatsuggested the precocious maturity of healthy vigorous animal lifepassed under the hot southern sun of halftropical country
Shewas one knew at glance warmblooded fullblooded with an evencomfortable balance of temperament
Her neck was thick and sloped toher shoulders with full beautiful curves and under her chin andunder her ears the flesh was as white and smooth as floss satin shadingexquisitely to faint delicate brown on her nape at the roots of herhair
Her throat rounded to meet her chin and cheek with soft swellof the skin tinted pale amber in the shadows but blending by barelyperceptible gradations to the sweet warm flush of her cheek
Thiscolour on her temples was just touched with certain blueness wherethe flesh was thin over the fine veining underneath
Her eyes were lightbrown and so wide open that on the slightest provocation the full discof the pupil was disclosed the lidsjust fraction of shade darkerthan the hue of her facewere edged with lashes that were almost black
While these lashes were not long they were thick and rimmed her eyeswith fine thin line
Her mouth was rather large the lips shuttight and nothing could have been more graceful more charming than theoutline of these full lips of hers and her round white chin modulatingdownward with certain delicious roundness to her neck her throat andthe sweet feminine amplitude of her breast
The slightest movement ofher head and shoulders sent gentle undulation through all thisbeauty of soft outlines and smooth surfaces the delicate amber shadowsdeepening or fading or losing themselves imperceptibly in the prettyrosecolour of her cheeks or the dark warmtinted shadow of her thickbrown hair
Her hair seemed almost to have life of its own almost Medusalikethick glossy and moist lying in heavy sweetsmelling masses over herforehead over her small ears with their pink lobes and far down uponher nape
Deep in between the coils and braids it was of bitumenbrownness but in the sunlight it vibrated with sheen like tarnishedgold
Like most large girls her movements were not hurried and thisindefinite deliberateness of gesture this slow grace this certain easeof attitude was charm that was all her own
But Hilmas greatest charm of all was her simplicitya simplicity thatwas not only in the calm regularity of her face with its statuesqueevenness of contour its broad surface of cheek and forehead and themasses of her straight smooth hair but was apparent as well in the longline of her carriage from her foot to her waist and the single deepswell from her waist to her shoulder
Almost unconsciously she dressedin harmony with this note of simplicity and on this occasion wore askirt of plain dark blue calico and white shirt waist crisp from thelaundry
And yet for all the dignity of this rigourous simplicity there wereabout Hilma small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintinesscharming beyond words
Even Annixter could not help noticing that herfeet were narrow and slender and that the little steel buckles of herlow shoes were polished bright and that her fingertips and nails wereof fine rosy pink
He found himself wondering how it was that girl in Hilmas positionshould be able to keep herself so pretty so trim so clean andfeminine but he reflected that her work was chiefly in the dairy andeven there of the lightest order
She was on the ranch more for the sakeof being with her parents than from any necessity of employment
Vaguelyhe seemed to understand that in that great new land of the West in theopenair healthy life of the ranches where the conditions of earninga livelihood were of the easiest refinement among the younger women waseasily to be foundnot the refinement of education nor culture butthe natural intuitive refinement of the woman not as yet defiled andcrushed out by the sordid strenuous lifestruggle of overpopulateddistricts
It was the original intended and natural delicacy of anelemental existence close to nature close to life close to the greatkindly earth
As Hilma laid the tablespread her arms opened to their widest reachthe white cloth setting little glisten of reflected light underneaththe chin Annixter stirred in his place uneasily
Oh its you is it Miss Hilma he remarked for the sake of sayingsomething
How do you doGoodmorning sir she answered looking up resting for moment onher outspread palms
hope you are betterHer voice was low in pitch and of velvety huskiness seeming to comemore from her chest than from her throat
Well Im some better growled Annixter
Then suddenly he demandedWheres that dogA decrepit Irish setter sometimes made his appearance in and about theranch house sleeping under the bed and eating when anyone about theplace thought to give him plate of bread
Annixter had no particular interest in the dog
For weeks at time heignored its existence
It was not his dog
But today it seemed as if hecould not let the subject rest
For no reason that he could explain evento himself he recurred to it continually
He questioned Hilma minutelyall about the dog
Who owned him
How old did she think he was
Did sheimagine the dog was sick
Where had he got to
Maybe he had crawledoff to die somewhere
He recurred to the subject all through the mealapparently he could talk of nothing else and as she finally went awayafter clearing off the table he went onto the porch and called afterherSay Miss HilmaYes sirIf that dog turns up again you let me knowVery well sirAnnixter returned to the diningroom and sat down in the chair he hadjust vacated
To hell with the dog he muttered enraged he could nottell why
When at length he allowed his attention to wander from Hilma Tree hefound that he had been staring fixedly at thermometer upon the wallopposite and this made him think that it had long been his intentionto buy fine barometer an instrument that could be accurately dependedon
But the barometer suggested the present condition of the weather andthe likelihood of rain
In such case much was to be done in the way ofgetting the seed ready and overhauling his ploughs and drills
He hadnot been away from the house in two days
It was time to be up anddoing
He determined to put in the afternoon taking look around and have late supper
He would not go to Los Muertos he would ignoreMagnus Derricks invitation
Possibly though it might be well to runover and see what was up
If do he said to himself Ill ride the buckskin The buckskinwas halfbroken broncho that fought like fiend under the saddleuntil the quirt and spur brought her to her senses
But Annixterremembered that the Trees cottage next the dairyhouse looked outupon the stables and perhaps Hilma would see him while he was mountingthe horse and be impressed with his courage
Huh grunted Annixter under his breath should like to see thatfool Delaney try to bust that bronch
Thats what ID like to seeHowever as Annixter stepped from the porch of the ranch house he wassurprised to notice grey haze over all the sky the sunlight wasgone there was sense of coolness in the air the weathervane on thebarna fine golden trotting horse with flamboyant mane and tailwasveering in southwest wind
Evidently the expected rain was close athand
Annixter crossed over to the stables reflecting that he could ride thebuckskin to the Trees cottage and tell Hilma that he would not be hometo supper
The conference at Los Muertos would be an admirable excusefor this and upon the spot he resolved to go over to the Derrick ranchhouse after all
As he passed the Trees cottage he observed with satisfaction thatHilma was going to and fro in the front room
If he busted the buckskinin the yard before the stable she could not help but see
Annixter foundthe stableman in the back of the barn greasing the axles of the buggyand ordered him to put the saddle on the buckskin
Why dont think shes here sir answered the stableman glancinginto the stalls
No remember now
Delaney took her out just afterdinner
His other horse went lame and he wanted to go down by the LongTrestle to mend the fence
He started out but had to come backOh Delaney got her did heYes sir
He had circus with her but he busted her right enough
When it comes to horse Delaney can wipe the eye of any cowpuncher inthe county guessHe can can he observed Annixter
Then after silence Well allright Billy put my saddle on whatever youve got here
Im going overto Los Muertos this afternoonWant to look out for the rain Mr Annixter remarked Billy
Guesswell have rain before nightIll take rubber coat answered Annixter
Bring the horse up to theranch house when youre readyAnnixter returned to the house to look for his rubber coat in deepdisgust not permitting himself to glance toward the dairyhouse andthe Trees cottage
But as he reached the porch he heard the telephoneringing his call
It was Presley who rang up from Los Muertos
He hadheard from Harran that Annixter was perhaps coming over that evening
If he came would he mind bringing over hisPresleysbicycle
He hadleft it at the Quien Sabe ranch the day before and had forgotten to comeback that way for it
Well objected Annixter surly note in his voice WAS going toRIDE over Oh never mind then returned Presley easily
was toblame for forgetting it
Dont bother about it
Ill come over some ofthese days and get it myselfAnnixter hung up the transmitter with vehement wrench and stamped outof the room banging the door
He found his rubber coat hanging in thehallway and swung into it with fierce movement of the shoulders thatall but started the seams
Everything seemed to conspire to thwart him
It was just like that absentminded crazy poet Presley to forget hiswheel
Well he could come after it himself
He Annixter would rideSOME horse anyhow
When he came out upon the porch he saw the wheelleaning against the fence where Presley had left it
If it stayed theremuch longer the rain would catch it
Annixter ripped out an oath
Atevery moment his illhumour was increasing
Yet for all that he wentback to the stable pushing the bicycle before him and countermandedhis order directing the stableman to get the buggy ready
He himselfcarefully stowed Presleys bicycle under the seat covering it with acouple of empty sacks and tarpaulin carriage cover
While he was doing this the stableman uttered an exclamation and pausedin the act of backing the horse into the shafts holding up handlistening
From the hollow roof of the barn and from the thick velvetlike paddingof dust over the ground outside and from among the leaves of the fewnearby trees and plants there came vast monotonous murmur that seemedto issue from all quarters of the horizon at once prolonged andsubdued rustling sound steady even persistent
Theres your rain announced the stableman
The first of the seasonAnd got to be out in it fumed Annixter and suppose those swinewill quit work on the big barn nowWhen the buggy was finally ready he put on his rubber coat climbed inand without waiting for the stableman to raise the top drove out intothe rain newlit cigar in his teeth
As he passed the dairyhouse hesaw Hilma standing in the doorway holding out her hand to the rain herface turned upward toward the grey sky amused and interested at thisfirst shower of the wet season
She was so absorbed that she did not seeAnnixter and his clumsy nod in her direction passed unnoticed
She did it on purpose Annixter told himself chewing fiercely on hiscigar
Cuts me now hey
Well this DOES settle it
She leaves thisranch before Im day olderHe decided that he would put off his tour of inspection till the nextday
Travelling in the buggy as he did he must keep to the road whichled to Derricks in very roundabout fashion by way of Guadalajara
This rain would reduce the thick dust of the road to two feet of viscidmud
It would take him quite three hours to reach the ranch house on LosMuertos
He thought of Delaney and the buckskin and ground his teeth
And all this trouble if you please because of fool feemale girl
Afine way for him to waste his time
Well now he was done with it
Hisdecision was taken now
She should pack
Steadily the rain increased
There was no wind
The thick veil ofwet descended straight from sky to earth blurring distant outlinesspreading vast sheen of grey over all the landscape
Its volume becamegreater the prolonged murmuring note took on deeper tone
At thegate to the road which led across Dykes hopfields toward GuadalajaraAnnixter was obliged to descend and raise the top of the buggy
In doingso he caught the flesh of his hand in the joint of the iron elbow thatsupported the top and pinched it cruelly
It was the last misery theculmination of long train of wretchedness
On the instant he hatedHilma Tree so fiercely that his sharply set teeth all but bit his cigarin two
While he was grabbing and wrenching at the buggytop the water fromhis hat brim dripping down upon his nose the horse restive under thedrench of the rain moved uneasily
Yahhh you he shouted inarticulate with exasperation
YouyouGorrr wait till get hold of you
WHOA youBut there was an interruption
Delaney riding the buckskin came arounda bend in the road at slow trot and Annixter getting into the buggyagain found himself face to face with him
Why hello Mr Annixter said he pulling up
Kind of sort of wetisnt itAnnixter his face suddenly scarlet sat back in his place abruptlyexclaimingOhoh there you are are youIve been down there explained Delaney with motion of his headtoward the railroad to mend that break in the fence by the LongTrestle and thought while was about it Id follow down along thefence toward Guadalajara to see if there were any more breaks
But Iguess its all rightOh you guess its all right do you observed Annixter through histeeth
Whywhyyes returned the other bewildered at the truculent ringin Annixters voice
mended that break by the Long Trestle just nowandWell why didnt you mend it week ago shouted Annixter wrathfully
Ive been looking for you all the morning have and who told you youcould take that buckskin
And the sheep were all over the right of waylast night because of that break and here that filthy pip Behrmancomes down here this morning and wants to make trouble for me Suddenlyhe cried out What do FEED you for
What do keep you around herefor
Think its just to fatten up your carcass heyWhy Mr Annixter began Delaney
And dont TALK to me vociferated the other exciting himself with hisown noise
Dont you say word to me even to apologise
If Ive spokento you once about that break Ive spoken fifty timesWhy sir declared Delaney beginning to get indignant the sheep didit themselves last nightI told you not to TALK to me clamoured Annixter
But say look hereGet off the ranch
You get off the ranch
And taking that buckskinagainst my express orders
wont have your kind about the placenot much
Im easygoing enough Lord knows but dont propose to beimposed on ALL the time
Pack off you understand and do it lively
Goto the foreman and tell him told him to pay you off and then clearout
And you hear me he concluded with menacing outthrust of hislower jaw you hear me if catch you hanging around the ranch houseafter this or if so much as see you on Quien Sabe Ill show you theway off of it my friend at the toe of my boot
Now then get out ofthe way and let me passAngry beyond the power of retort Delaney drove the spurs into thebuckskin and passed the buggy in single bound
Annixter gathered upthe reins and drove on muttering to himself and occasionally lookingback to observe the buckskin flying toward the ranch house in aspattering shower of mud Delaney urging her on his head bent downagainst the falling rain
Huh grunted Annixter with grim satisfaction certain sense of goodhumour at length returning to him that just about takes the saleratusout of YOUR dough my friendA little farther on Annixter got out of the buggy second time to openanother gate that let him out upon the Upper Road not far distant fromGuadalajara
It was the road that connected that town with Bonnevilleand that ran parallel with the railroad tracks
On the other side of thetrack he could see the infinite extension of the brown bare land ofLos Muertos turning now to soft moist welter of fertility underthe insistent caressing of the rain
The hard sunbaked clods weredecomposing the crevices between drinking the wet with an eagersucking noise
But the prospect was dreary the distant horizons wereblotted under drifting mists of rain the eternal monotony of the earthlay open to the sombre low sky without single adornment without asingle variation from its melancholy flatness
Near at hand the wiresbetween the telegraph poles vibrated with faint humming under themultitudinous fingering of the myriad of falling drops striking amongthem and dripping off steadily from one to another
The poles themselveswere dark and swollen and glistening with wet while the little cones ofglass on the transverse bars reflected the dull grey light of the end ofthe afternoon
As Annixter was about to drive on freight train passed comingfrom Guadalajara going northward toward Bonneville Fresno and SanFrancisco
It was long train moving slowly methodically with ameasured coughing of its locomotive and rhythmic cadence of its trucksover the interstices of the rails
On two or three of the flat cars nearits end Annixter plainly saw Magnus Derricks ploughs their brightcoating of red and green paint setting single brilliant note in allthis array of grey and brown
Annixter halted watching the train file past carrying Derricksploughs away from his ranch at this very time of the first rainwhen they would be most needed
He watched it silent thoughtful andwithout articulate comment
Even after it passed he sat in his place along time watching it lose itself slowly in the distance its prolongedrumble diminishing to faint murmur
Soon he heard the engine soundingits whistle for the Long Trestle
But the moving train no longer carried with it that impression of terrorand destruction that had so thrilled Presleys imagination the nightbefore
It passed slowly on its way with mournful roll of wheels likethe passing of cortege like file of artillerycaissons chariotingdead bodies the engines smoke enveloping it in mournful veilleaving sense of melancholy in its wake moving past therelugubrious lamentable infinitely sad under the grey sky and underthe grey mist of rain which continued to fall with subdued rustlingsound steady persistent vast monotonous murmur that seemed to comefrom all quarters of the horizon at once
CHAPTER IIIWhen Annixter arrived at the Los Muertos ranch house that same eveninghe found little group already assembled in the diningroom
MagnusDerrick wearing the frock coat of broadcloth that he had put on forthe occasion stood with his back to the fireplace
Harran sat close athand one leg thrown over the arm of his chair
Presley lounged on thesofa in corduroys and high laced boots smoking cigarettes
Brodersonleaned on his folded arms at one corner of the dining table andGenslinger editor and proprietor of the principal newspaper of thecounty the Bonneville Mercury stood with his hat and driving glovesunder his arm opposite Derrick halfemptied glass of whiskey andwater in his hand
As Annixter entered he heard Genslinger observe Ill have leader inthe Mercury tomorrow that will interest you people
Theres some talkof your ranch lands being graded in value this winter
suppose youwill all buyIn an instant the editors words had riveted upon him the attention ofevery man in the room
Annixter broke the moments silence that followedwith the remarkWell its about time they graded these lands of theirsThe question in issue in Genslingers remark was of the most vitalinterest to the ranchers around Bonneville and Guadalajara
NeitherMagnus Derrick Broderson Annixter nor Osterman actually owned allthe ranches which they worked
As yet the vast majority of these wheatlands were the property of the and The explanation of thiscondition of affairs went back to the early history of the Pacific andSouthwestern when as bonus for the construction of the road thenational government had granted to the company the odd numbered sectionsof land on either side of the proposed line of route for distance oftwenty miles
Indisputably these sections belonged to the and WThe evennumbered sections being government property could be and hadbeen taken up by the ranchers but the railroad sections or as theywere called the alternate sections would have to be purchased directfrom the railroad itself
But this had not prevented the farmers from coming in upon that partof the San Joaquin
Long before this the railroad had thrown open theselands and by means of circulars distributed broadcast throughout theState had expressly invited settlement thereon
At that time patentshad not been issued to the railroad for their oddnumbered sections butas soon as the land was patented the railroad would grade it in valueand offer it for sale the first occupants having the first chance ofpurchase
The price of these lands was to be fixed by the price thegovernment put upon its own adjoining landsabout two dollars and ahalf per acre
With cultivation and improvement the ranches must inevitably appreciatein value
There was every chance to make fortunes
When the railroadlands about Bonneville had been thrown open there had been almost arush in the matter of settlement and Broderson Annixter Derrick andOsterman being foremost with their claims had secured the pick of thecountry
But the land once settled upon the and seemed to bein no hurry as to fixing exactly the value of its sections included inthe various ranches and offering them for sale
The matter dragged alongfrom year to year was forgotten for months together being only broughtto mind on such occasions as this when the rumour spread that theGeneral Office was about to take definite action in the affair
As soon as the railroad wants to talk business with me observedAnnixter about selling me their interest in Quien Sabe Im ready
The land has more than quadrupled in value
Ill bet could sell ittomorrow for fifteen dollars an acre and if buy of the railroad fortwo and half an acre theres boodle in the gameFor two and half exclaimed Genslinger
You dont suppose therailroad will let their land go for any such figure as that do you
Wherever did you get that ideaFrom the circulars and pamphlets answered Harran that the railroadissued to us when they opened these lands
They are pledged to that
Even the and couldnt break such pledge as that
You are newin the country Mr Genslinger
You dont remember the conditions uponwhich we took up this landAnd our improvements exclaimed Annixter
Why Magnus and haveput about five thousand dollars between us into that irrigating ditchalready
guess we are not improving the land just to make it valuablefor the railroad people
No matter how much we improve the land or howmuch it increases in value they have got to stick by their agreement onthe basis of twofifty per acre
Heres one case where the and WDONT get everything in sightGenslinger frowned perplexed
AM new in the country as Harran says he answered but it seemsto me that theres no fairness in that proposition
The presence of therailroad has helped increase the value of your ranches quite as muchas your improvements
Why should you get all the benefit of the risein value and the railroad nothing
The fair way would be to share itbetween youI dont care anything about that declared Annixter
They agreed tocharge but twofifty and theyve got to stick to itWell murmured Genslinger from what know of the affair dontbelieve the and intends to sell for twofifty an acre at all
The managers of the road want the best price they can get for everythingin these hard timesTimes arent ever very hard for the railroad hazards old Broderson
Broderson was the oldest man in the room
He was about sixtyfive yearsof age venerable with white beard his figure bent earthwards withhard work
He was narrowminded man painfully conscientious in his statementslest he should be unjust to somebody slow thinker unable to let asubject drop when once he had started upon it
He had no sooner utteredhis remark about hard times than he was moved to qualify it
Hard times he repeated troubled perplexed note in his voicewell yesyes
suppose the road DOES have hard times maybe
Everybody doesof course
didnt mean that exactly
believe inbeing just and fair to everybody
mean that weve got to use theirlines and pay their charges good years AND bad years the and Wbeing the only road in the State
That iswell when say the onlyroadno wont say the ONLY road
Of course there are other roads
Theres the and and the San Francisco and North Pacific thatruns up to Ukiah
got brotherinlaw in Ukiah
Thats not much of awheat country round Ukiah though they DO grow SOME wheat there come tothink
But guess its too far north
Well of course there isnt MUCH
Perhaps sixty thousand acres in the whole countyif you include barleyand oats
dont know maybe its nearer forty thousand
dontremember very well
Thats good many years ago
IBut Annixter at the end of all patience turned to Genslinger cuttingshort the old manOh rot
Of course the railroad will sell at twofifty he cried
Weve got the contractsLook to them then Mr Annixter retorted Genslinger significantlylook to them
Be sure that you are protectedSoon after this Genslinger took himself away and Derricks Chinamancame in to set the table
What do you suppose he meant asked Broderson when Genslinger wasgone
About this land business said Annixter
Oh dont know
Some tomfool idea
Havent we got their terms printed in black and white intheir circulars
Theres their pledgeOh as to pledges murmured Broderson the railroad is not always TOOmuch hindered by thoseWheres Osterman demanded Annixter abruptly changing the subject asif it were not worth discussion
Isnt that goat Osterman coming downhere tonightYou telephoned him didnt you Presley inquired Magnus
Presley had taken Princess Nathalie upon his knee stroking her longsleek hair and the cat stupefied with beatitude had closed her eyesto two fine lines clawing softly at the corduroy of Presleys trouserswith alternate paws
Yes sir returned Presley
He said he would be hereAnd as he spoke young Osterman arrived
He was young fellow but singularly inclined to baldness
His earsvery red and large stuck out at right angles from either side of hishead and his mouth too was largea great horizontal slit beneathhis nose
His cheeks were of brownish red the cheek bones littlesalient
His face was that of comic actor singer of songs mannever at loss for an answer continually striving to make laugh
But he took no great interest in ranching and left the management ofhis land to his superintendents and foremen he himself living inBonneville
He was poser wearer of clothes forever acting partstriving to create an impression to draw attention to himself
Hewas not without certain energy but he devoted it to small ends toperfecting himself in little accomplishments continually running aftersome new thing incapable of persisting long in any one course
At onemoment his mania would be fencing the next sleightofhand tricksthe next archery
For upwards of one month he had devoted himself tolearning how to play two banjos simultaneously then abandoning thishad developed sudden passion for stamped leather work and had made aquantity of purses tennis belts and hat bands which he presented toyoung ladies of his acquaintance
It was his policy never to make anenemy
He was liked far better than he was respected
People spoke ofhim as that goat Osterman or that fool Osterman kid and invitedhim to dinner
He was of the sort who somehow cannot be ignored
If onlybecause of his clamour he made himself important
If he had one abidingtrait it was his desire of astonishing people and in some waybest known to himself managed to cause the circulation of the mostextraordinary stories wherein he himself was the chief actor
Hewas glib voluble dexterous ubiquitous teller of funny stories acracker of jokes
Naturally enough he was heavily in debt but carried the burden of itwith perfect nonchalance
The year before Behrman had held mortgagesfor fully third of his crop and had squeezed him viciously forinterest
But for all that Osterman and Behrman were continuallyseen arminarm on the main street of Bonneville
Osterman wasaccustomed to slap Behrman on his fat back declaringYoure good fellow old jellybelly after all heyAs Osterman entered from the porch after hanging his cavalry poncho anddripping hat on the rack outside Mrs Derrick appeared in the door thatopened from the diningroom into the glassroofed hallway just beyond
Osterman saluted her with effusive cordiality and with ingratiatingblandness
am not going to stay she explained smiling pleasantly at the groupof men her pretty wideopen brown eyes with their look of inquiry andinnocence glancing from face to face only came to see if you wantedanything and to say how do you doShe began talking to old Broderson making inquiries as to his wife whohad been sick the last week and Osterman turned to the company shakinghands all around keeping up an incessant stream of conversation
Hello boys and girls
Hello Governor
Sort of gathering of theclans tonight
Well if here isnt that man Annixter
Hello Buck
Whatdo you know
Kind of dusty out tonightAt once Annixter began to get red in the face retiring towards cornerof the room standing in an awkward position by the case of stuffedbirds shambling and confused while Mrs Derrick was present standingrigidly on both feet his elbows close to his sides
But he was angrywith Osterman muttering imprecations to himself horribly vexed thatthe young fellow should call him Buck before Magnuss wife
This goatOsterman
Hadnt he any sense that fool
Couldnt he ever learn how tobehave before feemale
Calling him Buck like that while Mrs Derrickwas there
Why stableboy would know better hired man would havebetter manners
All through the dinner that followed Annixter was out ofsorts sulking in his place refusing to eat by way of vindicating hisselfrespect resolving to bring Osterman up with sharp turn if hecalled him Buck again
The Chinaman had made certain kind of plum pudding for dessert andAnnixter who remembered other dinners at the Derricks had been savinghimself for this and had meditated upon it all through the meal
Nodoubt it would restore all his good humour and he believed his stomachwas so far recovered as to be able to stand it
But unfortunately the pudding was served with sauce that heabhorreda thick gruellike colourless mixture made from plain waterand sugar
Before he could interfere the Chinaman had poured quantityof it upon his plate
Faugh exclaimed Annixter
It makes me sick
Suchsuch SLOOP
Takeit away
Ill have mine straight if you dont mindThats good for your stomach Buck observed young Osterman makes itgo down kind of sort of slick dont you see
Sloop hey
Thats goodnameLook here dont you call me Buck
You dont seem to have any senseand besides it ISNT good for my stomach
know better
What do YOUknow about my stomach anyhow
Just looking at sloop like that makes mesickA little while after this the Chinaman cleared away the dessert andbrought in coffee and cigars
The whiskey bottle and the syphon ofsodawater reappeared
The men eased themselves in their places pushingback from the table lighting their cigars talking of the beginningof the rains and the prospects of rise in wheat
Broderson began anelaborate mental calculation trying to settle in his mind the exactdate of his visit to Ukiah and Osterman did sleightofhand tricks withbread pills
But Princess Nathalie the cat was uneasy
Annixter wasoccupying her own particular chair in which she slept every night
Shecould not go to sleep but spied upon him continually watching hisevery movement with her lambent yellow eyes clear as amber
Then at length Magnus who was at the head of the table moved in hisplace assuming certain magisterial attitude
Well gentlemen heobserved have lost my case against the railroad the grainratecase
Ulsteen decided against me and now hear rumours to the effectthat rates for the hauling of grain are to be advancedWhen Magnus had finished there was moments silence each member ofthe group maintaining his attitude of attention and interest
It wasHarran who first spoke
Behrman manipulated the whole affair
Theres big deal of somekind in the air and if there is we all know who is back of it SBehrman of course but whos back of him
Its ShelgrimShelgrim
The name fell squarely in the midst of the conversationabrupt grave sombre big with suggestion pregnant with hugeassociations
No one in the group who was not familiar with it no onefor that matter in the county the State the whole reach of the Westthe entire Union that did not entertain convictions as to the man whocarried it giant figure in the endofthecentury finance productof circumstance an inevitable result of conditions characteristictypical symbolic of ungovernable forces
In the New Movement the NewFinance the reorganisation of capital the amalgamation of powersthe consolidation of enormous enterprisesno one individual was moreconstantly in the eye of the world no one was more hated more dreadedno one more compelling of unwilling tribute to his commanding genius tothe colossal intellect operating the width of an entire continent thanthe president and owner of the Pacific and Southwestern
dont think however he has moved yet said Magnus
The thing for us then exclaimed Osterman is to stand from underbefore he doesMoved yet snorted Annixter
Hes probably moved so long ago thatweve never noticed itIn any case hazarded Magnus it is scarcely probable that thedealwhatever it is to behas been consummated
If we act quicklythere may be chanceAct quickly
How demanded Annixter
Good Lord
what can you do
Were cinched already
It all amounts to just this YOU CANT BUCKAGAINST THE RAILROAD
Weve tried it and tried it and we are stuckevery time
You yourself Derrick have just lost your grainratecase
Behrman did you up
Shelgrim owns the courts
Hes got men likeUlsteen in his pocket
Hes got the Railroad Commission in hispocket
Hes got the Governor of the State in his pocket
He keepsa milliondollar lobby at Sacramento every minute of the time thelegislature is in session hes got his own men on the floor of theUnited States Senate
He has the whole thing organised like an armycorps
What ARE you going to do
He sits in his office in San Franciscoand pulls the strings and weve got to danceButwellbut hazarded Broderson but theres the InterstateCommerce Commission
At least on longhaul rates theyHoh yes the Interstate Commerce Commission shouted Annixterscornfully thats great aint it
The greatest Punch and Judy showon earth
Its almost as good as the Railroad Commission
There neverwas and there never will be California Railroad Commission not in thepay of the and WIt is to the Railroad Commission nevertheless remarked Magnus thatthe people of the State must look for relief
That is our only hope
Once elect Commissioners who would be loyal to the people and the wholesystem of excessive rates falls to the groundWell why not HAVE Railroad Commission of our own then suddenlydeclared young Osterman
Because it cant be done retorted Annixter
YOU CANT BUCK AGAINSTTHE RAILROAD and if you could you cant organise the farmers in the SanJoaquin
We tried it once and it was enough to turn your stomach
Therailroad quietly bought delegates through Behrman and did us upWell thats the game to play said Osterman decisively buydelegatesIts the only game that seems to win admitted Harran gloomily
Orever will win exclaimed Osterman sudden excitement seeming to takepossession of him
His facethe face of comic actor with its greatslit of mouth and stiff red earswent abruptly pink
Look here he cried this thing is getting desperate
Weve foughtand fought in the courts and out and weve tried agitation andand allthe rest of it and Behrman sacks us every time
Now comes the timewhen theres prospect of big crop weve had no rain for two yearsand the land has had long rest
If there is any rain at all thiswinter well have bonanza year and just at this very moment whenweve got our chancea chance to pay off our mortgages and get clear ofdebt and make strikehere is Shelgrim making deal to cinch us andput up rates
And now heres the primaries coming off and new RailroadCommission going in
Thats why Shelgrim chose this time to make hisdeal
If we wait till Shelgrim pulls it off were done for thatsflat
tell you were in fix if we dont keep an eye open
Things aregetting desperate
Magnus has just said that the key to the whole thingis the Railroad Commission
Well why not have Commission of our own
Never mind how we get it lets get it
If its got to be bought letsbuy it and put our own men on it and dictate what the rates will be
Suppose it costs hundred thousand dollars
Well well get back morethan that in cheap ratesMr
Osterman said Magnus fixing the young man with swift glanceMr
Osterman you are proposing scheme of bribery sirI am proposing repeated Osterman scheme of bribery
Exactly soAnd crazy wildeyed scheme at that said Annixter gruffly
Evensupposing you bought Railroad Commission and got your schedule of lowrates what happens
The and crowd get out an injunction andtie you upThey would tie themselves up too
Hauling at low rates is better thanno hauling at all
The wheat has got to be moved Oh rot criedAnnixter
Arent you ever going to learn any sense
Dont you knowthat cheap transportation would benefit the Liverpool buyers and not us
Cant it be FED into you that you cant buck against the railroad
Whenyou try to buy Board of Commissioners dont you see that youll haveto bid against the railroad bid against corporation that can chuckout millions to our thousands
Do you think you can bid against the Pand WThe railroad dont need to know we are in the game against them tillweve got our men seatedAnd when youve got them seated whats to prevent the corporationbuying them right over your headIf weve got the right kind of men in they could not be bought thatway interposed Harran
dont know but what theres something inwhat Osterman says
Wed have the naming of the Commission and wed namehonest menAnnixter struck the table with his fist in exasperation
Honest men he shouted the kind of men you could get to go into sucha scheme would have to be DIShonest to begin withBroderson shifting uneasily in his place fingering his beard with avague uncertain gesture spoke againIt would be the CHANCE of themour Commissionersselling out againstthe certainty of Shelgrim doing us up
That is he hastened to addALMOST certainty pretty near certaintyOf course it would be chance exclaimed Osterman
But its cometo the point where weve got to take chances risk big stake to make abig strike and risk is better than sure failureI can be no party to scheme of avowed bribery and corruption MrOsterman declared Magnus ring of severity in his voice
amsurprised sir that you should even broach the subject in my hearingAnd cried Annixter it cant be doneI dont know muttered Harran maybe it just wants little sparklike this to fire the whole trainMagnus glanced at his son in considerable surprise
He had notexpected this of Harran
But so great was his affection for his son soaccustomed had he become to listening to his advice to respecting hisopinions that for the moment after the first shock of surprise anddisappointment he was influenced to give certain degree of attentionto this new proposition
He in no way countenanced it
At any moment hewas prepared to rise in his place and denounce it and Osterman both
Itwas trickery of the most contemptible order thing he believed to beunknown to the old school of politics and statesmanship to which he wasproud to belong but since Harran even for one moment considered ithe Magnus who trusted Harran implicitly would do likewiseif it wasonly to oppose and defeat it in its very beginnings
And abruptly the discussion began
Gradually Osterman by dint of hisclamour his strident reiteration the plausibility of his glib readyassertions the ease with which he extricated himself when apparentlydriven to corner completely won over old Broderson to his way ofthinking
Osterman bewildered him with his volubility the lightningrapidity with which he leaped from one subject to another garrulouswitty flamboyant terrifying the old man with pictures of the swiftapproach of ruin the imminence of danger
Annixter who led the argument against himloving argument though hedidappeared to poor advantage unable to present his side effectively
He called Osterman fool goat senseless crazyheaded jackassbut was unable to refute his assertions
His debate was the clumsyheaving of brickbats brutal direct
He contradicted everythingOsterman said as matter of principle made conflicting assertionsdeclarations that were absolutely inconsistent and when Osterman orHarran used these against him could only exclaimWell in way its so and then again in way it isntBut suddenly Osterman discovered new argument
If we swing thisdeal he cried weve got old jellybelly Behrman right where we wanthimHes the man that does us every time cried Harran
If there is dirtywork to be done in which the railroad doesnt wish to appear it isS Behrman who does it
If the freight rates are to be adjusted tosqueeze us little harder it is Behrman who regulates what we canstand
If theres judge to be bought it is Behrman who doesthe bargaining
If there is jury to be bribed it is Behrmanwho handles the money
If there is an election to be jobbed it is SBehrman who manipulates it
Its Behrman here and Behrman there
It isBehrman we come against every time we make move
It is Behrman who hasthe grip of us and will never let go till he has squeezed us bone dry
Why when think of it all sometimes wonder keep my hands off themanOsterman got on his feet leaning across the table gesturing wildlywith his right hand his seriocomic face with its bald foreheadand stiff red ears was inflamed with excitement
He took the floorcreating an impression attracting all attention to himself playing tothe gallery gesticulating clamourous full of noise
Well now is your chance to get even he vociferated
It is now ornever
You can take it and save the situation for yourselves and allCalifornia or you can leave it and rot on your own ranches
Buck knowyou
know youre not afraid of anything that wears skin
know youvegot sand all through you and know if showed you how we could putour deal through and seat Commission of our own you wouldnt hangback
Governor youre brave man
You know the advantage of prompt andfearless action
You are not the sort to shrink from taking chances
Toplay for big stakes is just your gameto stake fortune on the turnof card
You didnt get the reputation of being the strongest pokerplayer in El Dorado County for nothing
Now heres the biggest gamblethat ever came your way
If we stand up to it like men with guts in uswell win out
If we hesitate were lostI dont suppose you can help playing the goat Osterman remarkedAnnixter but whats your idea
What do you think we can do
Im notsaying he hastened to interpose that youve anyways convinced me byall this cackling
know as well as you that we are in hole
But Iknew that before came here tonight
YOUVE not done anything to makeme change my mind
But just what do you propose
Lets hear itWell say the first thing to do is to see Disbrow
Hes the politicalboss of the Denver Pueblo and Mojave road
We will have to get in withthe machine some way and thats particularly why want Magnus with us
He knows politics better than any of us and if we dont want to get soldagain we will have to have some one thats in the know to steer usThe only politics understand Mr Osterman answered Magnus sternlyare honest politics
You must look elsewhere for your politicalmanager
refuse to have any part in this matter
If the RailroadCommission can be nominated legitimately if your arrangements can bemade without bribery am with you to the last iota of my abilityWell you cant get what you want without paying for it contradictedAnnixter
Broderson was about to speak when Osterman kicked his foot under thetable
He himself held his peace
He was quick to see that if he couldinvolve Magnus and Annixter in an argument Annixter for the mere loveof contention would oppose the Governor and without knowing it wouldcommit himself to hisOstermansscheme
This was precisely what happened
In few moments Annixter wasdeclaring at top voice his readiness to mortgage the crop of Quien Sabeif necessary for the sake of busting Behrman He could see nogreat obstacle in the way of controlling the nominating convention sofar as securing the naming of two Railroad Commissioners was concerned
Two was all they needed
Probably it WOULD cost money
You didnt getsomething for nothing
It would cost them all good deal more if theysat like lumps on log and played tiddledywinks while Shelgrim soldout from under them
Then there was this too the and werehard up just then
The shortage on the States wheat crop for the lasttwo years had affected them too
They were retrenching in expendituresall along the line
Hadnt they just cut wages in all departments
Therewas this affair of Dykes to prove it
The railroad didnt always act asa unit either
There was always party in it that opposed spending toomuch money
He would bet that party was strong just now
He was kind ofsick himself of being kicked by Behrman
Hadnt that pip turned up onhis ranch that very day to bully him about his own line fence
Next hewould be telling him what kind of clothes he ought to wear
Harran hadthe right idea
Somebody had got to be busted mighty soon now and hedidnt propose that it should be he
Now you are talking something like sense observed Osterman
Ithought you would see it like that when you got my ideaYour idea YOUR idea cried Annixter
Why Ive had this idea myselffor over three yearsWhat about Disbrow asked Harran hastening to interrupt
Why do wewant to see DisbrowDisbrow is the political man for the Denver Pueblo and Mojave answered Osterman and you see its like this the Mojave road dontrun up into the valley at all
Their terminus is way to the south of usand they dont care anything about grain rates through the San Joaquin
They dont care how antirailroad the Commission is because theCommissions rulings cant affect them
But they divide traffic with theP and in the southern part of the State and they have gooddeal of influence with that road
want to get the Mojave road throughDisbrow to recommend Commissioner of our choosing to the and Wand have the and adopt him as their ownWho for instanceDarrell that Los Angeles manrememberWell Darrell is no particular friend of Disbrow said Annixter
Whyshould Disbrow take him upPREEcisely cried Osterman
We make it worth Disbrows while to doit
We go to him and say Mr
Disbrow you manage the politics for theMojave railroad and what you say goes with your Board of Directors
Wewant you to adopt our candidate for Railroad Commissioner for the thirddistrict
How much do you want for doing it
KNOW we can buy Disbrow
That gives us one Commissioner
We need not bother about that anymore
In the first district we dont make any move at all
We let thepolitical managers of the and nominate whoever they like
Then we concentrate all our efforts to putting in our man in the seconddistrict
There is where the big fight will comeI see perfectly well what you mean Mr Osterman observed Magnusbut make no mistake sir as to my attitude in this business
You maycount me as out of it entirelyWell suppose we win put in Annixter truculently alreadyacknowledging himself as involved in the proposed undertaking supposewe win and get low rates for hauling grain
How about you then
Youcount yourself IN then dont you
You get all the benefit of lowerrates without sharing any of the risks we take to secure them
Nonor any of the expense either
No you wont dirty your fingers withhelping us put this deal through but you wont be so cursed particularwhen it comes to sharing the profits will youMagnus rose abruptly to his full height the nostrils of his thinhawklike nose vibrating his smoothshaven face paler than ever
Stop right where you are sir he exclaimed
You forget yourselfMr Annixter
Please understand that tolerate such words as you havepermitted yourself to make use of from no man not even from my guest
Ishall ask you to apologiseIn an instant he dominated the entire group imposing respect that wasas much fear as admiration
No one made response
For the moment he wasthe Master again the Leader
Like so many delinquent schoolboys theothers cowered before him ashamed put to confusion unable to findtheir tongues
In that brief instant of silence following upon Magnussoutburst and while he held them subdued and overmastered the fabricof their scheme of corruption and dishonesty trembled to its base
Itwas the last protest of the Old School rising up there in denunciationof the new order of things the statesman opposed to the politicianhonesty rectitude uncompromising integrity prevailing for the lasttime against the devious manoeuvring the evil communications therotten expediency of corrupted institution
For few seconds no one answered
Then Annixter moving abruptly anduneasily in his place mutteredI spoke upon provocation
If you like well consider it unsaid
Idont know whats going to become of usgo out of business presumeI understand Magnus all right put in Osterman
He dont have togo into this thing if its against his conscience
Thats all right
Magnus can stay out if he wants to but that wont prevent us goingahead and seeing what we can do
Only theres this about it He turnedagain to Magnus speaking with every degree of earnestness everyappearance of conviction
did not deny Governor from the very startthat this would mean bribery
But you dont suppose that like the ideaeither
If there was one legitimate hope that was yet left untriedno matter how forlorn it was would try it
But theres not
Itis literally and soberly true that every means of helpevery honestmeanshas been attempted
Shelgrim is going to cinch us
Grain ratesare increasing while on the other hand the price of wheat is sagginglower and lower all the time
If we dont do something we are ruinedOsterman paused for moment allowing precisely the right number ofseconds to elapse then altering and lowering his voice addedI respect the Governors principles
admire them
They do him everydegree of credit Then turning directly to Magnus he concluded withBut only want you to ask yourself sir if at such crisis oneought to think of oneself to consider purely personal motives in such adesperate situation as this
Now we want you with us Governor perhapsnot openly if you dont wish it but tacitly at least
wont askyou for an answer tonight but what do ask of you is to consider thismatter seriously and think over the whole business
Will you do itOsterman ceased definitely to speak leaning forward across the tablehis eyes fixed on Magnuss face
There was silence
Outside the rainfell continually with an even monotonous murmur
In the group of menaround the table no one stirred nor spoke
They looked steadily atMagnus who for the moment kept his glance fixed thoughtfully upon thetable before him
In another moment he raised his head and looked fromface to face around the group
After all these were his neighbourshis friends men with whom he had been upon the closest terms ofassociation
In way they represented what now had come to be hisworld
His single swift glance took in the men one after another
Annixter rugged crude sitting awkwardly and uncomfortably in hischair his unhandsome face with its outthrust lower lip and deeplycleft masculine chin flushed and eager his yellow hair disorderedthe one tuft on the crown standing stiffly forth like the feather in anIndians scalp lock Broderson vaguely combing at his long beard with apersistent maniacal gesture distressed troubled and uneasy Ostermanwith his comedy face the face of musichall singer his head baldand set off by his great red ears leaning back in his place softlycracking the knuckle of forefinger and last of all and close to hiselbow his son his support his confidant and companion Harran solike himself with his own erect fine carriage his thin beaklikenose and his blond hair with its tendency to curl in forwarddirection in front of the ears young strong courageous full of thepromise of the future years
His blue eyes looked straight into hisfathers with what Magnus could fancy glance of appeal
Magnus couldsee that expression in the faces of the others very plainly
They lookedto him as their natural leader their chief who was to bring them outfrom this abominable trouble which was closing in upon them and in themall he saw many types
Theythese men around his table on that nightof the first rain of coming seasonseemed to stand in his imaginationfor many othersall the farmers ranchers and wheat growers of thegreat San Joaquin
Their words were the words of whole communitytheir distress the distress of an entire State harried beyond thebounds of endurance driven to the wall coerced exploited harassed tothe limits of exasperation
will think of it he said then hastenedto add but can tell you beforehand that you may expect only arefusalAfter Magnus had spoken there was prolonged silence
The conferenceseemed of itself to have come to an end for that evening
Presleylighted another cigarette from the butt of the one he had been smokingand the cat Princess Nathalie disturbed by his movement and by whiffof drifting smoke jumped from his knee to the floor and picking her wayacross the room to Annixter rubbed gently against his legs her tailin the air her back delicately arched
No doubt she thought it timeto settle herself for the night and as Annixter gave no indication ofvacating his chair she chose this way of cajoling him into ceding hisplace to her
But Annixter was irritated at the Princesss attentionsmisunderstanding their motive
Get out he exclaimed lifting his feet to the rung of the chair
Lord love me but sure do hate catBy the way observed Osterman passed Genslinger by the gate as Icame in tonight
Had he been hereYes he was here said Harran and but Annixter took the words outof his mouth
He says theres some talk of the railroad selling us their sectionsthis winterOh he did did he exclaimed Osterman interested at once
Where didhe hear thatWhere does railroad paper get its news
From the General Office IsupposeI hope he didnt get it straight from headquarters that the land was tobe graded at twenty dollars an acre murmured Broderson
Whats that demanded Osterman
Twenty dollars
Here put me onsomebody
Whats all up
What did Genslinger sayOh you neednt get scared said Annixter
Genslinger dont knowthats all
He thinks there was no understanding that the price of theland should not be advanced when the and came to sell to usOh muttered Osterman relieved
Magnus who had gone out into theoffice on the other side of the glassroofed hallway returned with along yellow envelope in his hand stuffed with newspaper clippings andthin closely printed pamphlets
Here is the circular he remarked drawing out one of the pamphlets
The conditions of settlement to which the railroad obligated itself arevery explicitHe ran over the pages of the circular then read aloudThe Company invites settlers to go upon its lands before patents areissued or the road is completed and intends in such cases to sell tothem in preference to any other applicants and at price based upon thevalue of the land without improvements and on the other page here heremarked they refer to this again
In ascertaining the value of thelands any improvements that settler or any other person may have onthe lands will not be taken into consideration neither will the pricebe increased in consequence thereof Settlers are thus insured thatin addition to being accorded the first privilege of purchase at thegraded price they will also be protected in their improvements
And here he commented in Section IX
it reads The lands are notuniform in price but are offered at various figures from upwardper acre
Usually land covered with tall timber is held at peracre and that with pine at
Most is for sale at andWhen you come to read that carefully hazarded old Brodersonitits not so VERY REASSURING
MOST is for sale at twofifty anacre it says
That dont mean ALL that only means SOME
wish nowthat had secured more ironclad agreement from the and whenI took up its sections on my ranch andand Genslinger is in positionto know the intentions of the railroad
At least hehehe is in TOUCHwith them
All newspaper men are
Those mean who are subsidised bythe General Office
But perhaps Genslinger isnt subsidised dontknow
II am not sure
MaybeperhapsOh you dont know and you do know and maybe and perhaps and yourenot so sure vociferated Annixter
How about ignoring the value of ourimprovements
Nothing hazy about THAT statement guess
It says in somany words that any improvements we make will not be considered when theland is appraised and thats the same thing isnt it
The unimprovedland is worth twofifty an acre only timber land is worth more andtheres none too much timber about hereWell one thing at time said Harran
The thing for us now is toget into this primary election and the convention and see if we can pushour men for Railroad CommissionersRight declared Annixter
He rose stretching his arms above his head
Ive about talked all the wind out of me he said
Think Ill bemoving along
Its pretty near midnightBut when Magnuss guests turned their attention to the matter ofreturning to their different ranches they abruptly realised that thedownpour had doubled and trebled in its volume since earlier in theevening
The fields and roads were veritable seas of viscid mud thenight absolutely blackdark assuredly not night in which to ventureout
Magnus insisted that the three ranchers should put up at LosMuertos
Osterman accepted at once Annixter after an interminablediscussion allowed himself to be persuaded in the end accepting asthough granting favour
Broderson protested that his wife who was notwell would expect him to return that night and would no doubt fretif he did not appear
Furthermore he lived close by at the junctionof the County and Lower Road
He put sack over his head and shoulderspersistently declining Magnuss offered umbrella and rubber coat andhurried away remarking that he had no foreman on his ranch and had tobe up and about at five the next morning to put his men to work
Fool muttered Annixter when the old man had gone
Imagine farming aranch the size of his without foremanHarran showed Osterman and Annixter where they were to sleep inadjoining rooms
Magnus soon afterward retired
Osterman found an excuse for going to bed but Annixter and Harranremained in the latters room in haze of blue tobacco smoke talkingtalking
But at length at the end of all argument Annixter got upremarkingWell Im going to turn in
Its nearly two oclockHe went to his room closing the door and Harran opening his window toclear out the tobacco smoke looked out for moment across the countrytoward the south
The darkness was profound impenetrable the rain fell with anuninterrupted roar
Near at hand one could hear the sound of drippingeaves and foliage and the eager sucking sound of the drinking earthand abruptly while Harran stood looking out one hand upon the upraisedsash great puff of the outside air invaded the room odourous withthe reek of the soaking earth redolent with fertility pungent heavytepid
He closed the window again and sat for few moments on the edgeof the bed one shoe in his hand thoughtful and absorbed wondering ifhis father would involve himself in this new scheme wondering if afterall he wanted him to
But suddenly he was aware of commotion issuing from the directionof Annixters room and the voice of Annixter himself upraised inexpostulation and exasperation
The door of the room to which Annixterhad been assigned opened with violent wrench and an angry voiceexclaimed to anybody who would listenOh yes funny isnt it
In way its funny and then again in away it isntThe door banged to so that all the windows of the house rattled in theirframes
Harran hurried out into the diningroom and there met Presley and hisfather who had been aroused as well by Annixters clamour
Osterman wasthere too his bald head gleaming like bulb of ivory in the light ofthe lamp that Magnus carried
Whats all up demanded Osterman
Whatever in the world is the matterwith BuckConfused and terrible sounds came from behind the door of Annixtersroom
prolonged monologue of grievance broken by explosions of wrathand the vague noise of some one in furious hurry
All at once andbefore Harran had chance to knock on the door Annixter flung it open
His face was blazing with anger his outthrust lip more prominent thanever his wiry yellow hair in disarray the tuft on the crown stickingstraight into the air like the upraised hackles of an angry hound
Evidently he had been dressing himself with the most headlong rapidityhe had not yet put on his coat and vest but carried them over his armwhile with his disengaged hand he kept hitching his suspenders over hisshoulders with persistent and hypnotic gesture
Without momentspause he gave vent to his indignation in torrent of words
Ah yes in my bed sloop aha
know the man who put it there hewent on glaring at Osterman and that man is PIP
Slimydisgusting stuff you heard me say didnt like it when the Chinkpassed it to me at dinnerand just for that reason you put it in mybed and stick my feet into it when turn in
Funny isnt it
Ohyes too funny for any use
Id laugh little louder if was youWell Buck protested Harran as he noticed the hat in Annixtershand youre not going home just forAnnixter turned on him with shout
Ill get plumb out of here he trumpeted
wont stay here anotherminuteHe swung into his waistcoat and coat scrabbling at the buttons in theviolence of his emotions
And dont know but what it will make mesick again to go out in night like this
NO wont stay
Some thingsare funny and then again there are some things that are not
Ah yessloop
Well thats all right
can be funny too when you come tothat
You dont get cent of money out of me
You can do your dirtybribery in your own dirty way
wont come into this scheme at all
wash my hands of the whole business
Its rotten and its wildeyedits dirt from start to finish and youll all land in States prison
You can count me outBut Buck look here you crazy fool cried Harran dont know whoput that stuff in your bed but Im not going to let you go back toQuien Sabe in rain like thisI know who put it in clamoured the other shaking his fists anddont call me Buck and Ill do as please
WILL go back home
Illget plumb out of here
Sorry came
Sorry ever lent myself to such adisgusting dishonest dirty bribery game as this all tonight
wontput dime into it no not pennyHe stormed to the door leading out upon the porch deaf to all reason
Harran and Presley followed him trying to dissuade him from going homeat that time of night and in such storm but Annixter was not to beplacated
He stamped across to the barn where his horse and buggy hadbeen stabled splashing through the puddles under foot going out of hisway to drench himself refusing even to allow Presley and Harran to helphim harness the horse
Whats the use of making fool of yourself Annixter remonstratedPresley as Annixter backed the horse from the stall
You act just likea tenyearold boy
If Osterman wants to play the goat why should youhelp him outHes PIP vociferated Annixter
You dont understand Presley
Itruns in my family to hate anything sticky
Itsitsits heredity
How would you like to get into bed at two in the morning and jam yourfeet down into slimy mess like that
Oh no
Its not so funny then
And you mark my words Mr Harran Derrick he continued as he climbedinto the buggy shaking the whip toward Harran this business we talkedover tonightIm OUT of it
Its yellow
Its too CURSED dishonestHe cut the horse across the back with the whip and drove out into thepelting rain
In few seconds the sound of his buggy wheels was lost inthe muffled roar of the downpour
Harran and Presley closed the barn and returned to the house shelteringthemselves under tarpaulin carriage cover
Once inside Harran went toremonstrate with Osterman who was still up
Magnus had again retired
The house had fallen quiet again
As Presley crossed the diningroom on the way to his own apartment inthe second story of the house he paused for moment looking abouthim
In the dull light of the lowered lamps the redwood panelling ofthe room showed dark crimson as though stained with blood
On themassive slab of the dining table the halfemptied glasses and bottlesstood about in the confusion in which they had been left reflectingthemselves deep into the polished wood the glass doors of the case ofstuffed birds was subdued shimmer the manycoloured Navajo blanketover the couch seemed mere patch of brown
Around the table the chairs in which the men had sat throughout theevening still ranged themselves in semicircle vaguely suggestive ofthe conference of the past few hours with all its possibilities of goodand evil its significance of future big with portent
The room wasstill
Only on the cushions of the chair that Annixter had occupied thecat Princess Nathalie at last comfortably settled in her accustomedplace dozed complacently her paws tucked under her breast filling thedeserted room with the subdued murmur of her contented purr
CHAPTER IVOn the Quien Sabe ranch in one of its western divisions near the linefence that divided it from the Osterman holding Vanamee was harnessingthe horses to the plough to which he had been assigned two days beforea stableboy from the division barn helping him
Promptly discharged from the employ of the sheepraisers after thelamentable accident near the Long Trestle Vanamee had presented himselfto Harran asking for employment
The season was beginning on allthe ranches work was being resumed
The rain had put the ground intoadmirable condition for ploughing and Annixter Broderson and Ostermanall had their gangs at work
Thus Vanamee was vastly surprised to findLos Muertos idle the horses still in the barns the men gathering inthe shade of the bunkhouse and eatinghouse smoking dozing or goingaimlessly about their arms dangling
The ploughs for which Magnus andHarran were waiting in fury of impatience had not yet arrived andsince the management of Los Muertos had counted upon having these inhand long before this time no provision had been made for keeping theold stock in repair many of these old ploughs were useless broken andout of order some had been sold
It could not be said definitelywhen the new ploughs would arrive
Harran had decided to wait one weeklonger and then in case of their nonappearance to buy consignmentof the old style of plough from the dealers in Bonneville
He couldafford to lose the money better than he could afford to lose the season
Failing of work on Los Muertos Vanamee had gone to Quien Sabe
Annixter whom he had spoken to first had sent him across the ranchto one of his division superintendents and this latter afterassuring himself of Vanamees familiarity with horses and his previousexperienceeven though somewhat remoteon Los Muertos had taken himon as driver of one of the gang ploughs then at work on his division
The evening before when the foreman had blown his whistle at sixoclock the long line of ploughs had halted upon the instant and thedrivers unharnessing their teams had taken them back to the divisionbarnsleaving the ploughs as they were in the furrows
But an hourafter daylight the next morning the work was resumed
After breakfastVanamee riding one horse and leading the others had returned tothe line of ploughs together with the other drivers
Now he was busyharnessing the team
At the division blacksmith shoptemporarily putuphe had been obliged to wait while one of his lead horses was shodand he had thus been delayed quite five minutes
Nearly all the otherteams were harnessed the drivers on their seats waiting for theforemans signal
All ready here inquired the foreman driving up to Vanamees team inhis buggy
All ready sir answered Vanamee buckling the last strap
He climbed to his seat shaking out the reins and turning about lookedback along the line then all around him at the landscape inundated withthe brilliant glow of the early morning
The day was fine
Since the first rain of the season there had been noother
Now the sky was without cloud pale blue delicate luminousscintillating with morning
The great brown earth turned huge flank toit exhaling the moisture of the early dew
The atmosphere washed cleanof dust and mist was translucent as crystal
Far off to the east thehills on the other side of Broderson Creek stood out against the pallidsaffron of the horizon as flat and as sharply outlined as if pasted onthe sky
The campanile of the ancient Mission of San Juan seemed as fineas frost work
All about between the horizons the carpet of the landunrolled itself to infinity
But now it was no longer parched with heatcracked and warped by merciless sun powdered with dust
The rain haddone its work not clod that was not swollen with fertility not afissure that did not exhale the sense of fecundity
One could not takea dozen steps upon the ranches without the brusque sensation thatunderfoot the land was alive roused at last from its sleep palpitatingwith the desire of reproduction
Deep down there in the recesses ofthe soil the great heart throbbed once more thrilling with passionvibrating with desire offering itself to the caress of the ploughinsistent eager imperious
Dimly one felt the deepseated trouble ofthe earth the uneasy agitation of its members the hidden tumult ofits womb demanding to be made fruitful to reproduce to disengage theeternal renascent germ of Life that stirred and struggled in its loins
The ploughs thirtyfive in number each drawn by its team of tenstretched in an interminable line nearly quarter of mile in lengthbehind and ahead of Vanamee
They were arranged as it were en echelonnot in filenot one directly behind the other but each succeedingplough its own width farther in the field than the one in front of it
Each of these ploughs held five shears so that when the entire companywas in motion one hundred and seventyfive furrows were made at thesame instant
At distance the ploughs resembled great column offield artillery
Each driver was in his place his glance alternatingbetween his horses and the foreman nearest at hand
Other foremen intheir buggies or buckboards were at intervals along the line likebattery lieutenants
Annixter himself on horseback in boots andcampaign hat cigar in his teeth overlooked the scene
The division superintendent on the opposite side of the line gallopedpast to position at the head
For long moment there was silence
Asense of preparedness ran from end to end of the column
All things wereready each man in his place
The days work was about to begin
Suddenly from distance at the head of the line came the shrilltrilling of whistle
At once the foreman nearest Vanamee repeated itat the same time turning down the line and waving one arm
The signalwas repeated whistle answering whistle till the sounds lost themselvesin the distance
At once the line of ploughs lost its immobility movingforward getting slowly under way the horses straining in the traces
Aprolonged movement rippled from team to team disengaging in its passagea multitude of soundsthe click of buckles the creak of strainingleather the subdued clash of machinery the cracking of whips the deepbreathing of nearly four hundred horses the abrupt commands and criesof the drivers and last of all the prolonged soothing murmur ofthe thick brown earth turning steadily from the multitude of advancingshears
The ploughing thus commenced continued
The sun rose higher
Steadilythe hundred iron hands kneaded and furrowed and stroked the brown humidearth the hundred iron teeth bit deep into the Titans flesh
Perchedon his seat the moist living reins slipping and tugging in his handsVanamee in the midst of this steady confusion of constantly varyingsensation sight interrupted by sound sound mingling with sight onthis swaying vibrating seat quivering with the prolonged thrill of theearth lapsed to sort of pleasing numbness in sense hypnotised bythe weaving maze of things in which he found himself involved
To keephis team at an even regular gait maintaining the precise intervalto run his furrows as closely as possible to those already made by theplough in frontthis for the moment was the entire sum of his duties
But while one part of his brain alert and watchful took cognisance ofthese matters all the greater part was lulled and stupefied with thelong monotony of the affair
The ploughing now in full swing enveloped him in vague slowmovingwhirl of things
Underneath him was the jarring jolting tremblingmachine not clod was turned not an obstacle encountered that he didnot receive the swift impression of it through all his body the veryfriction of the damp soil sliding incessantly from the shiny surface ofthe shears seemed to reproduce itself in his fingertips and along theback of his head
He heard the horsehoofs by the myriads crushing downeasily deeply into the loam the prolonged clinking of tracechainsthe working of the smooth brown flanks in the harness the clatter ofwooden hames the champing of bits the click of iron shoes againstpebbles the brittle stubble of the surface ground crackling andsnapping as the furrows turned the sonorous steady breaths wrenchedfrom the deep labouring chests strapbound shining with sweatand all along the line the voices of the men talking to the horses
Everywhere there were visions of glossy brown backs straining heavingswollen with muscle harness streaked with specks of froth broadcupshaped hoofs heavy with brown loam mens faces red with tan blueoveralls spotted with axlegrease muscled hands the knuckles whitenedin their grip on the reins and through it all the ammoniacal smell ofthe horses the bitter reek of perspiration of beasts and men thearoma of warm leather the scent of dead stubbleand stronger and morepenetrating than everything else the heavy enervating odour of theupturned living earth
At intervals from the tops of one of the rare low swells of the landVanamee overlooked wider horizon
On the other divisions of Quien Sabethe same work was in progress
Occasionally he could see another columnof ploughs in the adjoining divisionsometimes so close at hand thatthe subdued murmur of its movements reached his ear sometimes sodistant that it resolved itself into long brown streak upon thegrey of the ground
Farther off to the west on the Osterman ranch othercolumns came and went and once from the crest of the highest swell onhis division Vanamee caught distant glimpse of the Broderson ranch
There too moving specks indicated that the ploughing was under way
And farther away still far off there beyond the fine line of thehorizons over the curve of the globe the shoulder of the earth heknew were other ranches and beyond these others and beyond these stillothers the immensities multiplying to infinity
Everywhere throughout the great San Joaquin unseen and unheard athousand ploughs upstirred the land tens of thousands of shearsclutched deep into the warm moist soil
It was the long stroking caress vigorous male powerful for which theEarth seemed panting
The heroic embrace of multitude of iron handsgripping deep into the brown warm flesh of the land that quiveredresponsive and passionate under this rude advance so robust as to bealmost an assault so violent as to be veritably brutal
There underthe sun and under the speckless sheen of the sky the wooing ofthe Titan began the vast primal passion the two worldforces theelemental Male and Female locked in colossal embrace at grapples inthe throes of an infinite desire at once terrible and divine knowingno law untamed savage natural sublime
From time to time the gang in which Vanamee worked halted on the signalfrom foreman or overseer
The horses came to standstill the vagueclamour of the work lapsed away
Then the minutes passed
The whole workhung suspended
All up and down the line one demanded what had happened
The division superintendent galloped past perplexed and anxious
Forthe moment one of the ploughs was out of order bolt had slippeda lever refused to work or machine had become immobilised in heavyground or horse had lamed himself
Once even toward noon an entireplough was taken out of the line so out of gear that messenger had tobe sent to the division forge to summon the machinist
Annixter had disappeared
He had ridden farther on to the otherdivisions of his ranch to watch the work in progress there
At twelveoclock according to his orders all the division superintendents putthemselves in communication with him by means of the telephone wiresthat connected each of the division houses reporting the conditionof the work the number of acres covered the prospects of each ploughtraversing its daily average of twenty miles
At halfpast twelve Vanamee and the rest of the drivers ate theirlunch in the field the tin buckets having been distributed to them thatmorning after breakfast
But in the evening the routine of the previousday was repeated and Vanamee unharnessing his team riding one horseand leading the others returned to the division barns and bunkhouse
It was between six and seven oclock
The half hundred men of the gangthrew themselves upon the supper the Chinese cooks had set out in theshed of the eatinghouse long as bowling alley unpainted crude theseats benches the table covered with oil cloth
Overhead halfdozenkerosene lamps flared and smoked
The table was taken as if by assault the clatter of iron knives uponthe tin plates was as the reverberation of hail upon metal roof
Theploughmen rinsed their throats with great draughts of wine and theirelbows wide their foreheads flushed resumed the attack upon the beefand bread eating as though they would never have enough
All up anddown the long table where the kerosene lamps reflected themselves deepin the oilcloth cover one heard the incessant sounds of masticationand saw the uninterrupted movement of great jaws
At every moment oneor another of the men demanded fresh portion of beef another pint ofwine another halfloaf of bread
For upwards of an hour the gang ate
It was no longer supper
It was veritable barbecue crude andprimitive feasting barbaric homeric
But in all this scene Vanamee saw nothing repulsive
Presley wouldhave abhorred itthis feeding of the People this gorging of the humananimal eager for its meat
Vanamee simple uncomplicated living soclose to nature and the rudimentary life understood its significance
He knew very well that within short halfhour after this meal themen would throw themselves down in their bunks to sleep without movinginert and stupefied with fatigue till the morning
Work food andsleep all life reduced to its bare essentials uncomplex honesthealthy
They were strong these men with the strength of the soil theyworked in touch with the essential things back again to the startingpoint of civilisation coarse vital real and sane
For brief moment immediately after the meal pipes were lit andthe air grew thick with fragrant tobacco smoke
On corner of thediningroom table game of poker was begun
One of the drivers aSwede produced an accordion group on the steps of the bunkhouselistened with alternate gravity and shouts of laughter to theacknowledged storyteller of the gang
But soon the men began to turnin stretching themselves at full length on the horse blankets in theracklike bunks
The sounds of heavy breathing increased steadily lightswere put out and before the afterglow had faded from the sky the gangwas asleep
Vanamee however remained awake
The night was fine warm the skysilvergrey with starlight
By and by there would be moon
In thefirst watch after the twilight faint puff of breeze came up outof the south
From all around the heavy penetrating smell of thenewturned earth exhaled steadily into the darkness
After while whenthe moon came up he could see the vast brown breast of the earth turntoward it
Far off distant objects came into view The giant oak treeat Hoovens ranch house near the irrigating ditch on Los Muertos theskeletonlike tower of the windmill on Annixters Home ranch the clumpof willows along Broderson Creek close to the Long Trestle and last ofall the venerable tower of the Mission of San Juan on the high groundbeyond the creek
Thitherward like homing pigeons Vanamees thoughts turnedirresistibly
Near to that tower just beyond in the little hollowhidden now from his sight was the Seed ranch where Angele Varianhad lived
Straining his eyes peering across the intervening levelsVanamee fancied he could almost see the line of venerable pear treesin whose shadow she had been accustomed to wait for him
On many sucha night as this he had crossed the ranches to find her there
His mindwent back to that wonderful time of his life sixteen years beforethis when Angele was alive when they two were involved in the sweetintricacies of love so fine so pure so marvellous that it seemed tothem miracle manifestation thing veritably divine put into thelife of them and the hearts of them by God Himself
To that they hadbeen born
For this loves sake they had come into the world andthe mingling of their lives was to be the Perfect Life the intendedordained union of the soul of man with the soul of woman indissolubleharmonious as music beautiful beyond all thought foretaste ofHeaven hostage of immortality
No he Vanamee could never never forget never was the edge of hisgrief to lose its sharpness never would the lapse of time blunt thetooth of his pain
Once more as he sat there looking off across theranches his eyes fixed on the ancient campanile of the Mission churchthe anguish that would not die leaped at his throat tearing at hisheart shaking him and rending him with violence as fierce and asprofound as if it all had been but yesterday
The ache returned to hisheart physical keen pain his hands gripped tight together twistinginterlocked his eyes filled with tears his whole body shaken and rivenfrom head to heel
He had lost her
God had not meant it after all
The whole matter hadbeen mistake
That vast wonderful love that had come upon them hadbeen only the flimsiest mockery
Abruptly Vanamee rose
He knew thenight that was before him
At intervals throughout the course of hisprolonged wanderings in the desert on the mesa deep in the canonlost and forgotten on the flanks of unnamed mountains alone under thestars and under the moons white eye these hours came to him his griefrecoiling upon him like the recoil of vast and terrible engine
Then he must fight out the night wrestling with his sorrow prayingsometimes incoherent hardly conscious asking Why of the night andof the stars
Such another night had come to him now
Until dawn he knew he muststruggle with his grief torn with memories his imagination assaultedwith visions of vanished happiness
If this paroxysm of sorrow was toassail him again that night there was but one place for him to be
Hewould go to the Missionhe would see Father Sarria he would pass thenight in the deep shadow of the aged pear trees in the Mission garden
He struck out across Quien Sabe his face the face of an ascetic leanbrown infinitely sad set toward the Mission church
In about an hourhe reached and crossed the road that led northward from Guadalajaratoward the Seed ranch and little farther on forded Broderson Creekwhere it ran through one corner of the Mission land
He climbed thehill and halted out of breath from his brisk wall at the end of thecolonnade of the Mission itself
Until this moment Vanamee had not trusted himself to see the Mission atnight
On the occasion of his first daytime visit with Presley he hadhurried away even before the twilight had set in not daring for themoment to face the crowding phantoms that in his imagination filled theMission garden after dark
In the daylight the place had seemedstrange to him
None of his associations with the old building and itssurroundings were those of sunlight and brightness
Whenever during hislong sojourns in the wilderness of the Southwest he had called up thepicture in the eye of his mind it had always appeared to him in the dimmystery of moonless nights the venerable pear trees black with shadowthe fountain thing to be heard rather than seen
But as yet he had not entered the garden
That lay on the other side ofthe Mission
Vanamee passed down the colonnade with its uneven pavementof worn red bricks to the last door by the belfry tower and rang thelittle bell by pulling the leather thong that hung from hole in thedoor above the knob
But the maidservant who after long interval opened the doorblinking and confused at being roused from her sleep told Vanamee thatSarria was not in his room
Vanamee however was known to her as thepriests protege and great friend and she allowed him to enter tellinghim that no doubt he would find Sarria in the church itself
Theservant led the way down the cool adobe passage to larger room thatoccupied the entire width of the bottom of the belfry tower and whencea flight of aged steps led upward into the dark
At the foot of thestairs was door opening into the church
The servant admitted Vanameeclosing the door behind her
The interior of the Mission great oblong of whitewashed adobe witha flat ceiling was lighted dimly by the sanctuary lamp that hung fromthree long chains just over the chancel rail at the far end of thechurch and by two or three cheap kerosene lamps in brackets ofimitation bronze
All around the walls was the inevitable series ofpictures representing the Stations of the Cross
They were of ahideous crudity of design and composition yet were wrought out with aninnocent unquestioning sincerity that was not without its charm
Eachpicture framed alike in gilt bore its suitable inscription in staringblack letters
Simon The Cyrenean Helps Jesus to Carry His Cross Saint Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus Jesus Falls for the FourthTime and so on
Halfway up the length of the church the pews begancoffinlike boxes of blackened oak shining from years of friction eachwith its door while over them and built out from the wall was thepulpit with its tarnished gilt soundingboard above it like the raisedcover of great hatbox
Between the pews in the aisle the violentvermilion of strip of ingrain carpet assaulted the eye
Farther onwere the steps to the altar the chancel rail of wormriddled oak thehigh altar with its napery from the bargain counters of San Franciscostore the massive silver candlesticks each as much as one man couldlift the gift of dead Spanish queen and last the pictures of thechancel the Virgin in glory Christ in agony on the cross andSt John the Baptist the patron saint of the Mission the San JuanBautista of the early days gaunt grey figure in skins two fingersupraised in the gesture of benediction
The air of the place was cool and damp and heavy with the flat sweetscent of stale incense smoke
It was of vaultlike stillness and theclosing of the door behind Vanamee reechoed from corner to corner with aprolonged reverberation of thunder
However Father Sarria was not in the church
Vanamee took couple ofturns the length of the aisle looking about into the chapels on eitherside of the chancel
But the building was deserted
The priest had beenthere recently nevertheless for the altar furniture was in disarrayas though he had been rearranging it but moment before
On both sidesof the church and halfway up their length the walls were pierced bylow archways in which were massive wooden doors clamped with ironbolts
One of these doors on the pulpit side of the church stood ajarand stepping to it and pushing it wide open Vanamee looked diagonallyacross little patch of vegetablesbeets radishes and lettucetothe rear of the building that had once contained the cloisters andthrough an open window saw Father Sarria diligently polishing the silvercrucifix that usually stood on the high altar
Vanamee did not callto the priest
Putting finger to either temple he fixed his eyessteadily upon him for moment as he moved about at his work
In fewseconds he closed his eyes but only part way
The pupils contractedhis forehead lowered to an expression of poignant intensity
Soonafterward he saw the priest pause abruptly in the act of drawing thecover over the crucifix looking about him from side to side
He turnedagain to his work and again came to stop perplexed curious
Withuncertain steps and evidently wondering why he did so he came to thedoor of the room and opened it looking out into the night
Vanameehidden in the deep shadow of the archway did not move but his eyesclosed and the intense expression deepened on his face
The priesthesitated moved forward step turned back paused again then camestraight across the garden patch brusquely colliding with Vanameestill motionless in the recess of the archway
Sarria gave great start catching his breath
Ohoh its you
Was it you heard calling
No could not haveheardI remember now
What strange power
am not sure that it isright to do this thing Vanamee
II HAD to come
do not know why
It is great forcea powerI dont like it
Vanamee sometimes itfrightens meVanamee put his chin in the air
If had wanted to sir could have made you come to me from backthere in the Quien Sabe ranchThe priest shook his head
It troubles me he said to think that my own will can count for solittle
Just now could not resist
If deep river had been betweenus must have crossed it
Suppose had been asleep now It wouldhave been all the easier answered Vanamee
understand as little ofthese things as you
But think if you had been asleep your power ofresistance would have been so much the more weakenedPerhaps should not have waked
Perhaps should have come to you inmy sleepPerhapsSarria crossed himself
It is occult he hazarded
No do not likeit
Dear fellow he put his hand on Vanamees shoulder dontcallme that way again promise
See he held out his hand am all of atremble
There we wont speak of it further
Wait for me moment
Ihave only to put the cross in its place and fresh altar cloth andthen am done
Tomorrow is the feast of The Holy Cross and ampreparing against it
The night is fine
We will smoke cigar in thecloister gardenA few moments later the two passed out of the door on the other side ofthe church opposite the pulpit Sarria adjusting silk skull capon his tonsured head
He wore his cassock now and was far more thechurchman in appearance than when Vanamee and Presley had seen him on aformer occasion
They were now in the cloister garden
The place was charming
Everywheregrew clumps of palms and magnolia trees
grapevine over centuryold occupied trellis in one angle of the walls which surrounded thegarden on two sides
Along the third side was the church itself whilethe fourth was open the wall having crumbled away its site markedonly by line of eight great pear trees older even than the grapevinegnarled twisted bearing no fruit
Directly opposite the pear treesin the south wall of the garden was round arched portal whose gategiving upon the esplanade in front of the Mission was always closed
Small gravelled walks well kept bordered with mignonette twistedabout among the flower beds and underneath the magnolia trees
In thecentre was little fountain in stone basin green with moss whilejust beyond between the fountain and the pear trees stood what wasleft of sun dial the bronze gnomon green with the beatings ofthe weather the figures on the halfcircle of the dial worn awayillegible
But on the other side of the fountain and directly opposite the doorof the Mission ranged against the wall were nine gravesthree withheadstones the rest with slabs
Two of Sarrias predecessors wereburied here three of the graves were those of Mission Indians
One wasthought to contain former alcalde of Guadalajara two more held thebodies of De La Cuesta and his young wife taking with her to the gravethe illusion of her husbands love and the last one the ninth atthe end of the line nearest the pear trees was marked by littleheadstone the smallest of any on which together with the properdatesonly sixteen years apartwas cut the name Angele VarianBut the quiet the repose the isolation of the little cloister gardenwas infinitely delicious
It was tiny corner of the great valley thatstretched in all directions around itshut off discreet romantic agarden of dreams of enchantments of illusions
Outside there faroff the great grim world went clashing through its grooves but inhere never an echo of the grinding of its wheels entered to jar upon thesubdued modulation of the fountains uninterrupted murmur
Sarria and Vanamee found their way to stone bench against the sidewall of the Mission near the door from which they had just issuedand sat down Sarria lighting cigar Vanamee rolling and smokingcigarettes in Mexican fashion
All about them widened the vast calm night
All the stars were out
Themoon was coming up
There was no wind no sound
The insistent flowingof the fountain seemed only as the symbol of the passing of time athing that was understood rather than heard inevitable prolonged
Atlong intervals faint breeze hardly more than breath found its wayinto the garden over the enclosing walls and passed overhead spreadingeverywhere the delicious mingled perfume of magnolia blossoms ofmignonette of moss of grass and all the calm green life silentlyteeming within the enclosure of the walls
From where he sat Vanamee turning his head could look out underneaththe pear trees to the north
Close at hand little valley lay betweenthe high ground on which the Mission was built and the line of lowhills just beyond Broderson Creek on the Quien Sabe
In here was theSeed ranch which Angeles people had cultivated unique and beautifulstretch of five hundred acres planted thick with roses violetslilies tulips iris carnations tuberoses poppies heliotropeallmanner and description of flowers five hundred acres of them solidthick exuberant blooming and fading and leaving their seed or slipsto be marketed broadcast all over the United States
This had been thevocation of Angeles parentsraising flowers for their seeds
All overthe country the Seed ranch was known
Now it was arid almost dry butwhen in full flower toward the middle of summer the sight of thesehalfthousand acres royal with colourvermilion azure flamingyellowwas marvel
When an east wind blew men on the streets ofBonneville nearly twelve miles away could catch the scent of thisvalley of flowers this chaos of perfume
And into this life of flowers this world of colour this atmosphereoppressive and clogged and cloyed and thickened with sweet odour Angelehad been born
There she had lived her sixteen years
There she haddied
It was not surprising that Vanamee with his intense delicatesensitiveness to beauty his almost abnormal capacity for greathappiness had been drawn to her had loved her so deeply
She came to him from out of the flowers the smell of the roses in herhair of gold that hung in two straight plaits on either side of herface the reflection of the violets in the profound dark blue of hereyes perplexing heavylidded almondshaped oriental the aromaand the imperial red of the carnations in her lips with their almostEgyptian fulness the whiteness of the lilies the perfume of thelilies and the lilies slender balancing grace in her neck
Her handsdisengaged the odour of the heliotropes
The folds of her dress gave offthe enervating scent of poppies
Her feet were redolent of hyacinths
For long time after sitting down upon the bench neither the priestnor Vanamee spoke
But after while Sarria took his cigar from hislips sayingHow still it is
This is beautiful old garden peaceful very quiet
Some day shall be buried here
like to remember that and you tooVanameeQuien sabeYes you too
Where else
No it is better here yonder by the sideof the little girlI am not able to look forward yet sir
The things that are to be aresomehow nothing to me at all
For me they amount to nothingThey amount to everything my boyYes to one part of me but not to the part of me that belonged toAngelethe best part
Oh you dont know he exclaimed with suddenmovement no one can understand
What is it to me when you tell me thatsometime after shall die too somewhere in vague place you callHeaven shall see her again
Do you think that the idea of that evermade any ones sorrow easier to bear
Ever took the edge from any onesgriefBut you believe thatOh believe believe echoed the other
What do believe
believe or dont believe
can remember what she WAS butI cannot hope what she will be
Hope after all is only memory seenreversed
When try to see her in another lifewhatever you callitin Heavenbeyond the gravethis vague place of yours when tryto see her there she comes to my imagination only as what she wasmaterial earthly as loved her
Imperfect you say but that is asI saw her and as saw her loved her and as she WAS materialearthly imperfect she loved me
Its that that want he exclaimed
dont want her changed
dont want her spiritualised exaltedglorified celestial
want HER
think it is only this feeling thathas kept me from killing myself
would rather be unhappy in thememory of what she actually was than be happy in the realisation of hertransformed changed made celestial
am only human
Her soul
Thatwas beautiful no doubt
But again it was something very vagueintangible hardly more than phrase
But the touch of her hand wasreal the sound of her voice was real the clasp of her arms about myneck was real
Oh he cried shaken with sudden wrench of passiongive those back to me
Tell your God to give those back to methesound of her voice the touch of her hand the clasp of her dear armsREAL REAL and then you may talk to me of HeavenSarria shook his head
But when you meet her again he observed inHeaven you too will be changed
You will see her spiritualised withspiritual eyes
As she is now she does not appeal to you
It is because as you say you are only human while she isdivine
But when you come to be like her as she is now you will knowher as she really is not as she seemed to be because her voice wassweet because her hair was pretty because her hand was warm in yours
Vanamee your talk is that of foolish child
You are like one ofthe Corinthians to whom Paul wrote
Do you remember
Listen now
canrecall the words and such words beautiful and terrible at the sametime such majesty
They march like soldiers with trumpets
But someman will sayas you have said just nowHow are the dead raised up
And with what body do they come
Thou fool
That which thou sowest isnot quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest notthat body that shall be but bare grain
It may chance of wheat or ofsome other grain
But God giveth it body as it hath pleased him andto every seed his own body
It is sown natural body it is raiseda spiritual body
It is because you are natural body that you cannotunderstand her nor wish for her as spiritual body but when you areboth spiritual then you shall know each other as you areknow as younever knew before
Your grain of wheat is your symbol of immortality
You bury it in the earth
It dies and rises again thousand times morebeautiful
Vanamee your dear girl was only grain of humanity thatwe have buried here and the end is not yet
But all this is so old soold
The world learned it thousand years ago and yet each man thathas ever stood by the open grave of any one he loved must learn it allover again from the beginningVanamee was silent for moment looking off with unseeing eyes betweenthe trunks of the pear trees over the little valley
That may all be as you say he answered after while
have notlearned it yet in any case
Now only know that love heroh as ifit all were yesterdayand that am suffering suffering alwaysHe leaned forward his head supported on his clenched fists theinfinite sadness of his face deepening like shadow the tears brimmingin his deepset eyes
question that he must ask which involvedthe thing that was scarcely to be thought of occurred to him at thismoment
After hesitating for long moment he saidI have been away long time and have had no news of this placesince left
Is there anything to tell Father
Has any discovery beenmade any suspicion developed as tothe OtherThe priest shook his head
Not word not whisper
It is mystery
It always will beVanamee clasped his head between his clenched fists rocking himself toand fro
Oh the terror of it he murmured
The horror of it
And shethinkof it Sarria only sixteen little girl so innocent that she neverknew what wrong meant pure as little child is pure who believed thatall things were good mature only in her love
And to be struck downlike that while your God looked down from Heaven and would not take herpart All at once he seemed to lose control of himself
One of thosefuries of impotent grief and wrath that assailed him from time to timeblind insensate incoherent suddenly took possession of him
Atorrent of words issued from his lips and he flung out an arm thefist clenched in fierce quick gesture partly of despair partly ofdefiance partly of supplication
No your God would not take her part
Where was Gods mercy in that
Where was Heavens protection in that
Where was the loving kindness you preach about
Why did God give herlife if it was to be stamped out
Why did God give her the power of loveif it was to come to nothing
Sarria listen to me
Why did God makeher so divinely pure if He permitted that abomination
Ha he exclaimedbitterly your God
Why an Apache buck would have been more merciful
Your God
There is no God
There is only the Devil
The Heaven you prayto is only joke wretched trick delusion
It is only Hell that isrealSarria caught him by the arm
You are fool and child he exclaimed and it is blasphemy thatyou are saying
forbid it
You understand
forbid itVanamee turned on him with sudden cry
Then tell your God to giveher back to meSarria started away from him his eyes widening in astonishmentsurprised out of all composure by the others outburst
Vanameesswarthy face was pale the sunken cheeks and deepset eyes were markedwith great black shadows
The priest no longer recognised him
Theface that face of the ascetic lean framed in its long black hair andpointed beard was quivering with the excitement of hallucination
Itwas the face of the inspired shepherds of the Hebraic legends livingclose to nature the younger prophets of Israel dwellers in thewilderness solitary imaginative believing in the Vision havingstrange delusions gifted with strange powers
In brief second ofthought Sarria understood
Out into the wilderness the vast ariddesert of the Southwest Vanamee had carried his grief
For days forweeks months even he had been alone solitary speck lost in theimmensity of the horizons continually he was brooding haunted with hissorrow thinking thinking often hard put to it for food
The body wasillnourished and the mind concentrated forever upon one subject hadrecoiled upon itself had preyed upon the naturally nervous temperamenttill the imagination had become exalted morbidly active diseasedbeset with hallucinations forever in search of the manifestation ofthe miracle
It was small wonder that bringing fancy so distortedback to the scene of vanished happiness Vanamee should be racked withthe most violent illusions beset in the throes of veritable hysteria
Tell your God to give her back to me he repeated with fierceinsistence
It was the pitch of mysticism the imagination harassed and goadedbeyond the normal round suddenly flipping from the circumferencespinning off at tangent out into the void where all things seemedpossible hurtling through the dark there groping for the supernaturalclamouring for the miracle
And it was also the human natural protestagainst the inevitable the irrevocable the spasm of revolt under thesting of death the rebellion of the soul at the victory of the grave
He can give her back to me if He only will Vanamee cried
Sarriayou must help me
tell youI warn you sir cant last much longerunder it
My head is all wrong with itIve no more hold on my mind
Something must happen or shall lose my senses
am breaking downunder it all my body and my mind alike
Bring her to me make God showher to me
If all tales are true it would not be the first time
If Icannot have her at least let me see her as she was real earthly nother spirit her ghost
want her real self undefiled again
If this isdementia then let me be demented
But help me you and your God createthe delusion do the miracleStop cried the priest again shaking him roughly by the shoulder
Be yourself
This is dementia but shall NOT let you bedemented
Think of what you are saying
Bring her back to you
Isthat the way of God
thought you were man this is the talk of aweakminded girlVanamee stirred abruptly in his place drawing long breath and lookingabout him vaguely as if he came to himself
You are right he muttered
hardly know what am saying at times
But there are moments when my whole mind and soul seem to rise up inrebellion against what has happened when it seems to me that amstronger than death and that if only knew how to use the strengthof my will concentrate my power of thoughtvolitionthat couldIdont knownot call her backbutsomethingA diseased and distorted mind is capable of hallucinations if that iswhat you mean observed Sarria
Perhaps that is what mean
Perhaps want only the delusion afterallSarria did not reply and there was long silence
In the damp southcorners of the walls frog began to croak at exact intervals
Thelittle fountain rippled monotonously and magnolia flower dropped fromone of the trees falling straight as plummet through the motionlessair and settling upon the gravelled walk with faint rustling sound
Otherwise the stillness was profound
little later the priests cigar long since out slipped from hisfingers to the ground
He began to nod gently
Vanamee touched his arm
Asleep sirThe other started rubbing his eyes
Upon my word believe wasBetter go to bed sir
am not tired
think shall sit out here alittle longerWell perhaps would be better off in bed
YOUR bed is always readyfor you here whenever you want to use itNoI shall go back to Quien Sabelater
Goodnight sirGoodnight my boyVanamee was left alone
For long time he sat motionless in his placehis elbows on his knees his chin propped in his hands
The minutespassedthen the hours
The moon climbed steadily higher among thestars
Vanamee rolled and smoked cigarette after cigarette the bluehaze of smoke hanging motionless above his head or drifting in slowlyweaving filaments across the open spaces of the garden
But the influence of the old enclosure this corner of romance andmystery this isolated garden of dreams savouring of the past with itslegends its graves its crumbling sun dial its fountain with its rimeof moss was not to be resisted
Now that the priest had left him thesame exaltation of spirit that had seized upon Vanamee earlier in theevening by degrees grew big again in his mind and imagination
Hissorrow assaulted him like the flagellations of fine whiplash and hislove for Angele rose again in his heart it seemed to him never so deepso tender so infinitely strong
No doubt it was his familiarity withthe Mission garden his clearcut remembrance of it as it was in thedays when he had met Angele there tallying now so exactly with thereality there under his eyes that brought her to his imagination sovividly
As yet he dared not trust himself near her grave but for themoment he rose and his hands clasped behind him walked slowly frompoint to point amid the tiny gravelled walks recalling the incidents ofeighteen years ago
On the bench he had quitted he and Angele had oftensat
Here by the crumbling sun dial he recalled the night when he hadkissed her for the first time
Here again by the rim of the fountainwith its fringe of green she once had paused and baring her arm tothe shoulder had thrust it deep into the water and then withdrawingit had given it to him to kiss all wet and cool and here at lastunder the shadow of the pear trees they had sat evening after eveninglooking off over the little valley below them watching the night builditself domelike from horizon to zenith
Brusquely Vanamee turned away from the prospect
The Seed ranch was darkat this time of the year and flowerless
Far off toward its centre hehad caught brief glimpse of the house where Angele had lived and afaint light burning in its window
But he turned from it sharply
Thedeepseated travail of his grief abruptly reached the paroxysm
Withlong strides he crossed the garden and reentered the Mission churchitself plunging into the coolness of its atmosphere as into bath
What he searched for he did not know or rather did not define
Heknew only that he was suffering that longing for Angele for someobject around which his great love could enfold itself was tearingat his heart with iron teeth
He was ready to be deluded craved thehallucination begged pitifully for the illusion anything rather thanthe empty tenantless night the voiceless silence the vast lonelinessof the overspanning arc of the heavens
Before the chancel rail of the altar under the sanctuary lamp Vanameesank upon his knees his arms folded upon the rail his head bowed downupon them
He prayed with what words he could not say for what he didnot understandfor help merely for relief for an Answer to his cry
It was upon that at length that his disordered mind concentrateditself an Answerhe demanded he implored an Answer
Not vaguevisitation of Grace not formless sense of Peace but an Answersomething real even if the reality were fancied voice out of thenight responding to his hand in the dark clasping his gropingfingers breath human warm fragrant familiar like soft sweetcaress on his shrunken cheeks
Alone there in the dim halflight ofthe decaying Mission with its crumbling plaster its naive crudityof ornament and picture he wrestled fiercely with his desireswordsfragments of sentences inarticulate incoherent wrenched from histightshut teeth
But the Answer was not in the church
Above him over the high altarthe Virgin in glory with downcast eyes and folded hands grew vagueand indistinct in the shadow the colours fading tarnished by centuriesof incense smoke
The Christ in agony on the Cross was but lamentablevision of tormented anatomy grey flesh spotted with crimson
The StJohn the San Juan Bautista patron saint of the Mission the gauntfigure in skins two fingers upraised in the gesture of benedictiongazed stolidly out into the halfgloom under the ceiling ignoring thehuman distress that beat itself in vain against the altar rail belowand Angele remained as beforeonly memory far distant intangiblelost
Vanamee rose turning his back upon the altar with vague gesture ofdespair
He crossed the church and issuing from the lowarched dooropposite the pulpit once more stepped out into the garden
Here atleast was reality
The warm still air descended upon him like cloakgrateful comforting dispelling the chill that lurked in the damp mouldof plaster and crumbling adobe
But now he found his way across the garden on the other side of thefountain where ranged against the eastern wall were nine graves
Here Angele was buried in the smallest grave of them all marked by thelittle headstone with its two dates only sixteen years apart
To thisspot at last he had returned after the years spent in the desert thewildernessafter all the wanderings of the Long Trail
Here if everhe must have sense of her nearness
Close at hand short four feetunder that mound of grass was the form he had so often held in theembrace of his arms the face the very face he had kissed that facewith the hair of gold making threecornered the round white foreheadthe violetblue eyes heavylidded with their strange oriental slantupward toward the temples the sweet full lips almost Egyptian in theirfulnessall that strange perplexing wonderful beauty so troublousso enchanting so out of all accepted standards
He bent down dropping upon one knee hand upon the headstone andread again the inscription
Then instinctively his hand left the stoneand rested upon the low mound of turf touching it with the softness ofa caress and then before he was aware of it he was stretched at fulllength upon the earth beside the grave his arms about the low moundhis lips pressed against the grass with which it was covered
Thepentup grief of nearly twenty years rose again within his heart andoverflowed irresistible violent passionate
There was no one tosee no one to hear
Vanamee had no thought of restraint
He no longerwrestled with his painstrove against it
There was even sense ofrelief in permitting himself to be overcome
But the reaction from thisoutburst was equally violent
His revolt against the inevitable hisprotest against the grave shook him from head to foot goaded himbeyond all bounds of reason hounded him on and into the domain ofhysteria dementia
Vanamee was no longer master of himselfno longerknew what he was doing
At first he had been content with merely wild unreasoned cry toHeaven that Angele should be restored to him but the vast egotism thatseems to run through all forms of disordered intelligence gave hisfancy another turn
He forgot God
He no longer reckoned with Heaven
Hearrogated their powers to himselfstruggled to be of his own unaidedmight stronger than death more powerful than the grave
He haddemanded of Sarria that God should restore Angele to him but now heappealed directly to Angele herself
As he lay there his arms claspedabout her grave she seemed so near to him that he fancied she MUSThear
And suddenly at this moment his recollection of his strangecompelling powerthe same power by which he had called Presley to himhalfway across the Quien Sabe ranch the same power which had broughtSarria to his side that very eveningrecurred to him
Concentrating hismind upon the one object with which it had so long been filled Vanameehis eyes closed his face buried in his arms exclaimedCome to meAngeledont you hear
Come to meBut the Answer was not in the Grave
Below him the voiceless Earth laysilent moveless withholding the secret jealous of that which it heldso close in its grip refusing to give up that which had been confidedto its keeping untouched by the human anguish that above there on itssurface clutched with despairing hands at grave long made
The Earththat only that morning had been so eager so responsive to the lightestsummons so vibrant with Life now at night holding death within itsembrace guarding inviolate the secret of the Grave was deaf to allentreaty refused the Answer and Angele remained as before only amemory far distant intangible lost
Vanamee lifted his head looking about him with unseeing eyes tremblingwith the exertion of his vain effort
But he could not as yet allowhimself to despair
Never before had that curious power of attractionfailed him
He felt himself to be so strong in this respect that hewas persuaded if he exerted himself to the limit of his capacitysomethinghe could not say whatmust come of it
If it was onlya selfdelusion an hallucination he told himself that he would becontent
Almost of its own accord his distorted mind concentrated itself againevery thought all the power of his will riveting themselves uponAngele
As if she were alive he summoned her to him
His eyes fixedupon the name cut into the headstone contracted the pupils growingsmall his fists shut tight his nerves braced rigid
For few seconds he stood thus breathless expectant awaiting themanifestation the Miracle
Then without knowing why hardly consciousof what was transpiring he found that his glance was leaving theheadstone was turning from the grave
Not only this but his wholebody was following the direction of his eyes
Before he knew it he wasstanding with his back to Angeles grave was facing the north facingthe line of pear trees and the little valley where the Seed ranch lay
At first he thought this was because he had allowed his will to weakenthe concentrated power of his mind to grow slack
And once more turningtoward the grave he banded all his thoughts together in consummateeffort his teeth grinding together his hands pressed to his forehead
He forced himself to the notion that Angele was alive and to thiscreature of his imagination he addressed himselfAngele he cried in low voice Angele am calling youdo youhear
Come to mecome to me now nowInstead of the Answer he demanded that inexplicable counterinfluencecut across the current of his thought
Strive as he would against ithe must veer to the north toward the pear trees
Obeying it he turnedand still wondering took step in that direction then another andanother
The next moment he came abruptly to himself in the blackshadow of the pear trees themselves and opening his eyes foundhimself looking off over the Seed ranch toward the little house in thecentre where Angele had once lived
Perplexed he returned to the grave once more calling upon theresources of his will and abruptly so soon as these reached certainpoint the same crosscurrent set in
He could no longer keep his eyesupon the headstone could no longer think of the grave and what it held
He must face the north he must be drawn toward the pear trees andthere left standing in their shadow looking out aimlessly over the Seedranch wondering bewildered
Farther than this the influence neverdrew him but up to this pointthe line of pear treesit was not to beresisted
For time the peculiarity of the affair was of more interest to Vanameethan even his own distress of spirit and once or twice he repeated theattempt almost experimentally and invariably with the same result sosoon as he seemed to hold Angele in the grip of his mind he was movedto turn about toward the north and hurry toward the pear trees on thecrest of the hill that overlooked the little valley
But Vanamees unhappiness was too keen this night for him to dwell longupon the vagaries of his mind
Submitting at length and abandoning thegrave he flung himself down in the black shade of the pear trees hischin in his hands and resigned himself finally and definitely to theinrush of recollection and the exquisite grief of an infinite regret
To his fancy she came to him again
He put himself back many years
Heremembered the warm nights of July and August profoundly still thesky encrusted with stars the little Mission garden exhaling the mingledperfumes that all through the scorching day had been distilled underthe steady blaze of summers sun
He saw himself as another personarriving at this their rendezvous
All day long she had been inhis mind
All day long he had looked forward to this quiet hour thatbelonged to her
It was dark
He could see nothing but by and byhe heard step gentle rustle of the grass on the slope of the hillpressed under an advancing foot
Then he saw the faint gleam of pallidgold of her hair barely visible glow in the starlight and heard themurmur of her breath in the lapse of the overpassing breeze
And thenin the midst of the gentle perfumes of the garden the perfumes of themagnolia flowers of the mignonette borders of the crumbling wallsthere expanded new odour or the faint mingling of many odours thesmell of the roses that lingered in her hair of the lilies that exhaledfrom her neck of the heliotrope that disengaged itself from her handsand arms and of the hyacinths with which her little feet were redolentAnd then suddenly it was herselfher eyes heavylidded violet bluefull of the love of him her sweet full lips speaking his name herhands clasping his hands his shoulders his neckher whole dear bodygiving itself into his embrace her lips against his her hands holdinghis head drawing his face down to hers
Vanamee as he remembered all this flung out an arm with cry of painhis eyes searching the gloom all his mind in strenuous mutiny againstthe triumph of Death
His glance shot swiftly out across the nightunconsciously following the direction from which Angele used to come tohim
Come to me now he exclaimed under his breath tense and rigid withthe vast futile effort of his will
Come to me now now
Dont you hearme Angele
You must you must comeSuddenly Vanamee returned to himself with the abruptness of blow
His eyes opened
He half raised himself from the ground
Swiftly hisscattered wits readjusted themselves
Never more sane never morehimself he rose to his feet and stood looking off into the night acrossthe Seed ranch
What was it he murmured bewildered
He looked around him from side to side as if to get in touch withreality once more
He looked at his hands at the rough bark of the peartree next which he stood at the streaked and raineroded walls ofthe Mission and garden
The exaltation of his mind calmed itself theunnatural strain under which he laboured slackened
He became thoroughlymaster of himself again matteroffact practical keen
But just so sure as his hands were his own just so sure as the barkof the pear tree was rough the mouldering adobe of the Mission wallsdampjust so sure had Something occurred
It was vague intangibleappealing only to some strange nameless sixth sense but none the lessperceptible
His mind his imagination sent out from him across thenight across the little valley below him speeding hither and thitherthrough the dark lost confused had suddenly paused hovering hadfound Something
It had not returned to him emptyhanded
It had comeback but now there was changemysterious illusive
There were nowords for this that had transpired
But for the moment one thing onlywas certain
The night was no longer voiceless the dark was no longerempty
Far off there beyond the reach of vision unlocalised strangea ripple had formed on the still black pool of the night had formedflashed one instant to the stars then swiftly faded again
The nightshut down once more
There was no soundnothing stirred
For the moment Vanamee stood transfixed struck rigid in his placestupefied his eyes staring breathless with utter amazement
Thenstep by step he shrank back into the deeper shadow treading with theinfinite precaution of prowling leopard
qualm of something verymuch like fear seized upon him
But immediately on the heels of thisfirst impression came the doubt of his own senses
Whatever had happenedhad been so ephemeral so faint so intangible that now he wonderedif he had not deceived himself after all
But the reaction followed
Surely there had been Something
And from that moment began for himthe most poignant uncertainty of mind
Gradually he drew back into thegarden holding his breath listening to every faintest sound walkingupon tiptoe
He reached the fountain and wetting his hands passed themacross his forehead and eyes
Once more he stood listening
The silencewas profound
Troubled disturbed Vanamee went away passing out of the gardendescending the hill
He forded Broderson Creek where it intersected theroad to Guadalajara and went on across Quien Sabe walking slowlyhis head bent down his hands clasped behind his back thoughtfulperplexed
CHAPTER VAt seven oclock in the bedroom of his ranch house in thewhitepainted iron bedstead with its bluegrey army blankets and redcounterpane Annixter was still asleep his face red his mouth openhis stiff yellow hair in wild disorder
On the wooden chair at thebedhead stood the kerosene lamp by the light of which he had beenreading the previous evening
Beside it was paper bag of dried prunesand the limp volume of Copperfield the place marked by slip ofpaper torn from the edge of the bag
Annixter slept soundly making great work of the business unable totake even his rest gracefully
His eyes were shut so tight that the skinat their angles was drawn into puckers
Under his pillow his twohands were doubled up into fists
At intervals he gritted his teethferociously while from time to time the abrupt sound of his snoringdominated the brisk ticking of the alarm clock that hung from the brassknob of the bedpost within six inches of his ear
But immediately after seven this clock sprung its alarm with theabruptness of an explosion and within the second Annixter had hurledthe bedclothes from him and flung himself up to sitting posture onthe edge of the bed panting and gasping blinking at the light rubbinghis head dazed and bewildered stupefied at the hideous suddenness withwhich he had been wrenched from his sleep
His first act was to take down the alarm clock and stifle its prolongedwhirring under the pillows and blankets
But when this had been done hecontinued to sit stupidly on the edge of the bed curling his toes awayfrom the cold of the floor his halfshut eyes heavy with sleep fixedand vacant closing and opening by turns
For upwards of three minuteshe alternately dozed and woke his head and the whole upper half of hisbody sagging abruptly sideways from moment to moment
But at lengthcoming more to himself he straightened up ran his fingers through hishair and with prodigious yawn murmured vaguelyOh Lord
Ohh LORDHe stretched three or four times twisting about in his place curlingand uncurling his toes muttering from time to time between two yawnsOh Lord
Oh LordHe stared about the room collecting his thoughts readjusting himselffor the days work
The room was barren the walls of tongueandgroove sheathingalternatebrown and yellow boardslike the walls of stable were adorned withtwo or three unframed lithographs the Christmas souvenirs of weeklyperiodicals fastened with great wire nails bunch of herbs orflowers lamentably withered and grey with dust was affixed to themirror over the black walnut washstand by the window and yellowedphotograph of Annixters combined harvesterhimself and his men in agroup before ithung close at hand
On the floor at the bedside andbefore the bureau were two oval ragcarpet rugs
In the corners ofthe room were muddy boots McClellan saddle surveyors transit anempty coalhod and box of iron bolts and nuts
On the wall over thebed in gilt frame was Annixters college diploma while on thebureau amid litter of hairbrushes dirty collars driving glovescigars and the like stood broken machine for loading shells
It was essentially mans room rugged uncouth virile full of theodours of tobacco of leather of rusty iron the bare floor hollowed bythe grind of hobnailed boots the walls marred by the friction of heavythings of metal
Strangely enough Annixters clothes were disposedof on the single chair with the precision of an old maid
Thus he hadplaced them the night before the boots set carefully side by side thetrousers with the overalls still upon them neatly folded upon the seatof the chair the coat hanging from its back
The Quien Sabe ranch house was sixroom affair all on one floor
Byno excess of charity could it have been called home
Annixter was awealthy man he could have furnished his dwelling with quite as muchelegance as that of Magnus Derrick
As it was however he consideredhis house merely as place to eat to sleep to change his clothesin as shelter from the rain an office where business wastransactednothing more
When he was sufficiently awake Annixter thrust his feet into pair ofwicker slippers and shuffled across the office adjoining his bedroomto the bathroom just beyond and stood under the icy shower fewminutes his teeth chattering fulminating oaths at the coldness of thewater
Still shivering he hurried into his clothes and having pushedthe button of the electric bell to announce that he was ready forbreakfast immediately plunged into the business of the day
While hewas thus occupied the butchers cart from Bonneville drove intothe yard with the days supply of meat
This cart also brought theBonneville paper and the mail of the previous night
In the bundle ofcorrespondence that the butcher handed to Annixter that morning was atelegram from Osterman at that time on his second trip to Los Angeles
It readFlotation of company in this district assured
Have secured services ofdesirable party
Am now in position to sell you your share stock as peroriginal planAnnixter grunted as he tore the despatch into strips
Well hemuttered that part is settled thenHe made little pile of the torn strips on the top of the unlightedstove and burned them carefully scowling down into the flicker offire thoughtful and preoccupied
He knew very well what Osterman referred to by Flotation of company and also who was the desirable party he spoke of
Under protest as he was particular to declare and after interminableargument Annixter had allowed himself to be reconciled with Ostermanand to be persuaded to reenter the proposed political deal Acommittee had been formed to finance the affairOsterman oldBroderson Annixter himself and with reservations hardly more thana lookeron Harran Derrick
Of this committee Osterman was consideredchairman
Magnus Derrick had formally and definitely refused hisadherence to the scheme
He was trying to steer middle course
Hisposition was difficult anomalous
If freight rates were cut through theefforts of the members of the committee he could not very well avoidtaking advantage of the new schedule
He would be the gainer thoughsharing neither the risk nor the expense
But meanwhile the days werepassing the primary elections were drawing nearer
The committee couldnot afford to wait and by way of beginning Osterman had gone to LosAngeles fortified by large sum of moneya purse to which AnnixterBroderson and himself had contributed
He had put himself in touch withDisbrow the political man of the Denver Pueblo and Mojave road andhad had two interviews with him
The telegram that Annixter receivedthat morning was to say that Disbrow had been bought over and wouldadopt Parrell as the and candidate for Railroad Commissionerfrom the third district
One of the cooks brought up Annixters breakfast that morning and hewent through it hastily reading his mail at the same time and glancingover the pages of the Mercury Genslingers paper
The Mercury Annixter was persuaded received subsidy from the Pacific andSouthwestern Railroad and was hardly better than the mouthpieceby which Shelgrim and the General Office spoke to ranchers aboutBonneville
An editorial in that mornings issue saidIt would not be surprising to the wellinformed if the longdeferredregrade of the value of the railroad sections included in the LosMuertos Quien Sabe Osterman and Broderson properties was made beforethe first of the year
Naturally the tenants of these lands feel aninterest in the price which the railroad will put upon its holdingsand it is rumoured they expect the land will be offered to them fortwo dollars and fifty cents per acre
It needs no seventh daughter of aseventh daughter to foresee that these gentlemen will be disappointedRot vociferated Annixter to himself as he finished
He rolled thepaper into wad and hurled it from him
What does Genslinger know about it
stand on my agreementwith the and Wfrom two fifty to five dollars an acrethereit is in black and white
The road IS obligated
And my improvements
Imade the land valuable by improving it irrigating it draining it andcultivating it
Talk to ME
know betterThe most abiding impression that Genslingers editorial made upon himwas that possibly the Mercury was not subsidised by the corporationafter all
If it was Genslinger would not have been led into makinghis mistake as to the value of the land
He would have known that therailroad was under contract to sell at two dollars and half an acreand not only this but that when the land was put upon the market itwas to be offered to the present holders first of all
Annixter calledto mind the explicit terms of the agreement between himself and therailroad and dismissed the matter from his mind
He lit cigar put onhis hat and went out
The morning was fine the air nimble brisk
On the summit of theskeletonlike tower of the artesian well the windmill was turningsteadily in breeze from the southwest
The water in the irrigatingditch was well up
There was no cloud in the sky
Far off to the eastand west the bulwarks of the valley the Coast Range and the foothillsof the Sierras stood out pale amethyst against the delicate pink andwhite sheen of the horizon
The sunlight was veritable flood crystallimpid sparkling setting feeling of gayety in the air stirring upan effervescence in the blood tumult of exuberance in the veins
But on his way to the barns Annixter was obliged to pass by the opendoor of the dairyhouse
Hilma Tree was inside singing at her workher voice of velvety huskiness more of the chest than of the throatmingling with the liquid dashing of the milk in the vats and churns andthe clear sonorous clinking of the cans and pans
Annixter turned intothe dairyhouse pausing on the threshold looking about him
Hilmastood bathed from head to foot in the torrent of sunlight that poured inupon her from the three wideopen windows
She was charming deliciousradiant of youth of health of wellbeing
Into her eyes wide openbrown rimmed with their fine thin line of intense black lashes thesun set diamond flash the same golden light glowed all around herthick moist hair lambent beautiful sheen of almost metalliclustre and reflected itself upon her wet lips moving with the wordsof her singing
The whiteness of her skin under the caress of this halevigorous morning light was dazzling pure of fineness beyond words
Beneath the sweet modulation of her chin the reflected light from theburnished copper vessel she was carrying set vibration of pale gold
Overlaying the flush of rose in her cheeks seen only when she stoodagainst the sunlight was faint sheen of down lustrous flossdelicate as the pollen of flower or the impalpable powder of mothswing
She was moving to and fro about her work alert joyous robustand from all the fine full amplitude of her figure from her thickwhite neck sloping downward to her shoulders from the deep feminineswell of her breast the vigorous maturity of her hips there wasdisengaged vibrant note of gayety of exuberant animal life sanehonest strong
She wore skirt of plain blue calico and shirtwaistof pink linen clean trim while her sleeves turned back to hershoulders showed her large white arms wet with milk redolent andfragrant with milk glowing and resplendent in the early morning light
On the threshold Annixter took off his hat
Good morning Miss HilmaHilma who had set down the copper can on top of the vat turned aboutquickly
Oh GOOD morning sir and unconsciously she made little gestureof salutation with her hand raising it part way toward her head as aman would have done
Well began Annixter vaguely how are you getting along down hereOh very fine
Today there is not so much to do
We drew the wheyhours ago and now we are just done putting the curd to press
havebeen cleaning
See my pans
Wouldnt they do for mirrors sir
And thecopper things
have scrubbed and scrubbed
Oh you can look into thetiniest corners everywhere you wont find so much as the littlestspeck of dirt or grease
love CLEAN things and this room is my ownparticular place
Here can do just as please and that is to keepthe cement floor and the vats and the churns and the separators andespecially the cans and coppers clean clean and to see that the milkis pure oh so that little baby could drink it and to have the airalways sweet and the sunoh lots and lots of sun morning noon andafternoon so that everything shines
You know never see the sun setthat it dont make me little sad yes always just little
Isntit funny
should want it to be day all the time
And when the day isgloomy and dark am just as sad as if very good friend of mine hadleft me
Would you believe it
Just until within few years when Iwas big girl sixteen and over mamma had to sit by my bed every nightbefore could go to sleep
was afraid in the dark
Sometimes amnow
Just imagine and now am nineteena young ladyYou were hey observed Annixter for the sake of saying something
Afraid in the dark
What ofghostsNno dont know what
wanted the light wanted She drewa deep breath turning towards the window and spreading her pinkfingertips to the light
Oh the SUN
love the sun
See put yourhand therehere on the top of the vatlike that
Isnt it warm
Isntit fine
And dont you love to see it coming in like that through thewindows floods of it and all the little dust in it shining
Wherethere is lots of sunlight think the people must be very good
Itsonly wicked people that love the dark
And the wicked things are alwaysdone and planned in the dark think
Perhaps too thats why hatethings that are mysteriousthings that cant see that happen in thedark She wrinkled her nose with little expression of aversion
Ihate mystery
Maybe thats why am afraid in the darkor was
Ishouldnt like to think that anything could happen around me that Icouldnt see or understand or explainShe ran on from subject to subject positively garrulous talking in herlowpitched voice of velvety huskiness for the mere enjoyment of puttingher ideas into speech innocently assuming that they were quite asinteresting to others as to herself
She was yet great child ignoringthe fact that she had ever grown up taking childs interest in herimmediate surroundings direct straightforward plain
While speakingshe continued about her work rinsing out the cans with mixture of hotwater and soda scouring them bright and piling them in the sunlight ontop of the vat
Obliquely and from between his narrowed lids Annixter scrutinised herfrom time to time more and more won over by her adorable freshnessher clean fine youth
The clumsiness that he usually experienced in thepresence of women was wearing off
Hilma Trees direct simplicity puthim at his ease
He began to wonder if he dared to kiss Hilma and ifhe did dare how she would take it
spark of suspicion flickered upin his mind
Did not her manner imply vaguely an invitation
Onenever could tell with feemales
That was why she was talking so much nodoubt holding him there affording the opportunity
She had bestlook out or he would take her at her word
Oh had forgotten suddenly exclaimed Hilma the very thing Iwanted to show youthe new press
You remember asked for one lastmonth
This is it
See this is how it works
Here is where the curdsgo look
And this cover is screwed down like this and then you workthe lever this way She grasped the lever in both hands throwing herweight upon it her smooth bare arm swelling round and firm with theeffort one slim foot in its low shoe set off with the bright steelbuckle braced against the wall
My but that takes strength she panted looking up at him andsmiling
But isnt it fine press
Just what we neededAnd Annixter cleared his throat and where do you keep the cheesesand the butter He thought it very likely that these were in the cellarof the dairy
In the cellar answered Hilma
Down here see She raised the flapof the cellar door at the end of the room
Would you like to see
Comedown Ill show youShe went before him down into the cool obscurity underneath redolentof new cheese and fresh butter
Annixter followed certain excitementbeginning to gain upon him
He was almost sure now that Hilma wanted himto kiss her
At all events one could but try
But as yet he was notabsolutely sure
Suppose he had been mistaken in her suppose she shouldconsider herself insulted and freeze him with an icy stare
Annixterwinced at the very thought of it
Better let the whole business go andget to work
He was wasting half the morning
Yet if she DID want togive him the opportunity of kissing her and he failed to take advantageof it what ninny she would think him she would despise him for beingafraid
He afraid
He Annixter afraid of fool feemale girl
Whyhe owed it to himself as man to go as far as he could
He told himselfthat that goat Osterman would have kissed Hilma Tree weeks ago
To testhis state of mind he imagined himself as having decided to kiss herafter all and at once was surprised to experience poignant qualm ofexcitement his heart beating heavily his breath coming short
At thesame time his courage remained with him
He was not afraid to try
Hefelt greater respect for himself because of this
His selfassurancehardened within him and as Hilma turned to him asking him to tastea cut from one of the ripe cheeses he suddenly stepped close to herthrowing an arm about her shoulders advancing his head
But at the last second he bungled hesitated Hilma shrank from himsupple as young reed Annixter clutched harshly at her arm and trodhis full weight upon one of her slender feet his cheek and chin barelytouching the delicate pink lobe of one of her ears his lips brushingmerely fold of her shirt waist between neck and shoulder
The thingwas failure and at once he realised that nothing had been furtherfrom Hilmas mind than the idea of his kissing her
She started back from him abruptly her hands nervously clasped againsther breast drawing in her breath sharply and holding it with littletremulous catch of the throat that sent quivering vibration the lengthof her smooth white neck
Her eyes opened wide with childlike lookmore of astonishment than anger
She was surprised out of all measurediscountenanced taken all aback and when she found her breath gavevoice to great Oh of dismay and distress
For an instant Annixter stood awkwardly in his place ridiculousclumsy murmuring over and over againWellwellthats all rightwhos going to hurt you
You neednt beafraidwhos going to hurt youthats all rightThen suddenly with quick indefinite gesture of one arm heexclaimedGoodbye IIm sorryHe turned away striding up the stairs crossing the dairyroom andregained the open air raging and furious
He turned toward the barnsclapping his hat upon his head muttering the while under his breathOh you goat
You beastly fool PIP
Good LORD what an ass youve madeof yourself nowSuddenly he resolved to put Hilma Tree out of his thoughts
The matterwas interfering with his work
This kind of thing was sure not earningany money
He shook himself as though freeing his shoulders of anirksome burden and turned his entire attention to the work nearest athand
The prolonged rattle of the shinglers hammers upon the roof of the bigbarn attracted him and crossing over between the ranch house and theartesian well he stood for some time absorbed in the contemplationof the vast building amused and interested with the confusion ofsoundsthe clatter of hammers the cadenced scrape of saws and therhythmic shuffle of planesthat issued from the gang of carpenters whowere at that moment putting the finishing touches upon the roof and rowsof stalls
boy and two men were busy hanging the great sliding door atthe south end while the painterscome down from Bonneville early thatmorningwere engaged in adjusting the spray and force engine by meansof which Annixter had insisted upon painting the vast surfaces ofthe barn condemning the use of brushes and pots for such work asoldfashioned and outofdate
He called to one of the foremen to ask when the barn would be entirelyfinished and was told that at the end of the week the hay and stockcould be installed
And precious long time youve been at it too Annixter declared
Well you know the rainOh rot the rain
work in the rain
You and your unions make mesickBut Mr Annixter we couldnt have begun painting in the rain
The jobwould have been spoiledHoh yes spoiled
Thats all very well
Maybe it would and thenagain maybe it wouldntBut when the foreman had left him Annixter could not forbear growlof satisfaction
It could not be denied that the barn was superbmonumental even
Almost any one of the other barns in the county couldbe swung birdcage fashion inside of it with room to spare
In everysense the barn was precisely what Annixter had hoped of it
In hispleasure over the success of his idea even Hilma for the moment wasforgotten
And now murmured Annixter Ill give that dance in it
Ill makeem sit upIt occurred to him that he had better set about sending out theinvitations for the affair
He was puzzled to decide just how the thingshould be managed and resolved that it might be as well to consultMagnus and Mrs Derrick
want to talk of this telegram of the goats with Magnus anyhow he said to himself reflectively and theres things got to do inBonneville before the first of the monthHe turned about on his heel with last look at the barn and set offtoward the stable
He had decided to have his horse saddled and rideover to Bonneville by way of Los Muertos
He would make day of itwould see Magnus Harran old Broderson and some of the business men ofBonneville
few moments later he rode out of the barn and the stableyard afresh cigar between his teeth his hat slanted over his face against therays of the sun as yet low in the east
He crossed the irrigating ditchand gained the trailthe short cut over into Los Muertos by wayof Hoovens
It led south and west into the low ground overgrown bygreygreen willows by Broderson Creek at this time of the rainy seasona stream of considerable volume farther on dipping sharply to passunderneath the Long Trestle of the railroad
On the other side of theright of way Annixter was obliged to open the gate in Derricks linefence
He managed this without dismounting swearing at the horsethe while and spurring him continually
But once inside the gate hecantered forward briskly
This part of Los Muertos was Hoovens holding some five hundred acresenclosed between the irrigating ditch and Broderson Creek and halfthe way across Annixter came up with Hooven himself busily at workreplacing broken washer in his seeder
Upon one of the horses hitchedto the machine her hands gripped tightly upon the harness of thecollar Hilda his little daughter with her small hobnailed bootsand boys canvas overalls sat exalted and petrified with ecstasy andexcitement her eyes wide opened her hair in tangle

Hooven the washer replaced turned to his work again starting up thehorses
The seeder advanced whirring
Ach Hilda leedle girl he cried hold tight bei der shdrap on
Gedt oop youAnnixter cantered on
In few moments he had crossed Broderson Creekand had entered upon the Home ranch of Los Muertos
Ahead of him but sofar off that the greater portion of its bulk was below the horizon hecould see the Derricks home roof or two between the dull green ofcypress and eucalyptus
Nothing else was in sight
The brown earthsmooth unbroken was as limitless mudcoloured ocean
The silencewas profound
Then at length Annixters searching eye made out blur on the horizonto the northward the blur concentrated itself to speck the speckgrew by steady degrees to spot slowly moving note of dull colourbarely darker than the land but an inky black silhouette as it topped alow rise of ground and stood for moment outlined against the pale blueof the sky
Annixter turned his horse from the road and rode across theranch land to meet this new object of interest
As the spot grew largerit resolved itself into constituents collection of units itsshape grew irregular fragmentary
disintegrated nebulous confusionadvanced toward Annixter preceded as he discovered on nearer approachby medley of faint sounds
Now it was no longer spot but columna column that moved accompanied by spots
As Annixter lessened thedistance these spots resolved themselves into buggies or men onhorseback that kept pace with the advancing column
There were horses inthe column itself
At first glance it appeared as if there were nothingelse riderless squadron tramping steadily over the upturned ploughland of the ranch
But it drew nearer
The horses were in lines sixabreast harnessed to machines
The noise increased defined itself
There was shout or two occasionally horse blew through his nostrilswith prolonged vibrating snort
The click and clink of metal work wasincessant the machines throwing off continual rattle of wheels andcogs and clashing springs
The column approached nearer was close athand
The noises mingled to subdued uproar bewildering confusionthe impact of innumerable hoofs was veritable rumble
Machine aftermachine appeared and Annixter drawing to one side remained fornearly ten minutes watching and interested while like an array ofchariotsclattering jostling creaking clashing an interminableprocession machine succeeding machine sixhorse team succeedingsixhorse teambustling hurriedMagnus Derricks thirtythree graindrills each with its eight hoes went clamouring past like anadvance of military seeding the ten thousand acres of the great ranchfecundating the living soil implanting deep in the dark womb of theEarth the germ of life the sustenance of whole world the food of anentire People
When the drills had passed Annixter turned and rode back to the LowerRoad over the land now thick with seed
He did not wonder that theseeding on Los Muertos seemed to be hastily conducted
Magnus and HarranDerrick had not yet been able to make up the time lost at the beginningof the season when they had waited so long for the ploughs to arrive
They had been behindhand all the time
On Annixters ranch the landhad not only been harrowed as well as seeded but in some casescrossharrowed as well
The labour of putting in the vast crop wasover
Now there was nothing to do but wait while the seed silentlygerminated nothing to do but watch for the wheat to come up
When Annixter reached the ranch house of Los Muertos under the shadeof the cypress and eucalyptus trees he found Mrs Derrick on the porchseated in long wicker chair
She had been washing her hair and thelight brown locks that yet retained so much of their brightness werecarefully spread in the sun over the back of her chair
Annixter couldnot but remark that spite of her more than fifty years Annie Derrickwas yet rather pretty
Her eyes were still those of young girl justtouched with an uncertain expression of innocence and inquiry but asher glance fell upon him he found that that expression changed to oneof uneasiness of distrust almost of aversion
The night before this after Magnus and his wife had gone to bed theyhad lain awake for hours staring up into the dark talking talking
Magnus had not long been able to keep from his wife the news of thecoalition that was forming against the railroad nor the fact that thiscoalition was determined to gain its ends by any means at its command
He had told her of Ostermans scheme of fraudulent election to seat aBoard of Railroad Commissioners who should be nominees of the farminginterests
Magnus and his wife had talked this matter over and overagain and the same discussion begun immediately after supper theevening before had lasted till far into the night
At once Annie Derrick had been seized with sudden terror lest Magnusafter all should allow himself to be persuaded should yield to thepressure that was every day growing stronger
None better than she knewthe iron integrity of her husbands character
None better than sheremembered how his dearest ambition that of political preferment hadbeen thwarted by his refusal to truckle to connive to compromise withhis ideas of right
Now at last there seemed to be change
Longcontinued oppression petty tyranny injustice and extortion had drivenhim to exasperation
Behrmans insults still rankled
He seemednearly ready to countenance Ostermans scheme
The very fact that hewas willing to talk of it to her so often and at such great length wasproof positive that it occupied his mind
The pity of it the tragedyof it
He Magnus the Governor who had been so staunch so rigidlyupright so loyal to his convictions so bitter in his denunciation ofthe New Politics so scathing in his attacks on bribery and corruptionin high places was it possible that now at last he could bebrought to withhold his condemnation of the devious intrigues of theunscrupulous going on there under his very eyes
That Magnus should notcommand Harran to refrain from all intercourse with the conspiratorshad been matter of vast surprise to Mrs Derrick
Time was when Magnuswould have forbidden his son to so much as recognise dishonourableman
But besides all this Derricks wife trembled at the thought ofher husband and son engaging in so desperate grapple with therailroadthat great monster ironhearted relentless infinitelypowerful
Always it had issued triumphant from the fight always SBehrman the Corporations champion remained upon the field as victorplacid unperturbed unassailable
But now more terrible struggle thanany hitherto loomed menacing over the rim of the future money was to bespent like water personal reputations were to be hazarded in the issuefailure meant ruin in all directions financial ruin moral ruinruin of prestige ruin of character
Success to her mind was almostimpossible
Annie Derrick feared the railroad
At night when everythingelse was still the distant roar of passing trains echoed across LosMuertos from Guadalajara from Bonneville or from the Long Trestlestraight into her heart
At such moments she saw very plainly thegalloping terror of steam and steel with its single eye cyclopeanred shooting from horizon to horizon symbol of vast power huge andterrible the leviathan with tentacles of steel to oppose which meantto be ground to instant destruction beneath the clashing wheels
Noit was better to submit to resign oneself to the inevitable
Sheobliterated herself shrinking from the harshness of the worldstriving with vain hands to draw her husband back with her
Just before Annixters arrival she had been sitting thoughtful in herlong chair an open volume of poems turned down upon her lap her glancelosing itself in the immensity of Los Muertos that from the edge ofthe lawn close by unrolled itself gigantic toward the far southernhorizon wrinkled and serrated after the seasons ploughing
The earthhitherto grey with dust was now upturned and brown
As far as the eyecould reach it was empty of all life bare mournful absolutely stilland as she looked there seemed to her morbid imaginationdiseasedand disturbed with long brooding sick with the monotony of repeatedsensationto be disengaged from all this immensity sense of vastoppression formless disquieting
The terror of sheer bigness grewslowly in her mind loneliness beyond words gradually enveloped her
Shewas lost in all these limitless reaches of space
Had she been abandonedin midocean in an open boat her terror could hardly have beengreater
She felt vividly that certain uncongeniality which when all issaid forever remains between humanity and the earth which supports it
She recognised the colossal indifference of nature not hostile evenkindly and friendly so long as the human antswarm was submissiveworking with it hurrying along at its side in the mysterious marchof the centuries
Let however the insect rebel strive to make headagainst the power of this nature and at once it became relentless agigantic engine vast power huge terrible leviathan with heartof steel knowing no compunction no forgiveness no tolerance crushingout the human atom with sound less calm the agony of destructionsending never jar never the faintest tremour through all thatprodigious mechanism of wheels and cogs
Such thoughts as these did not take shape distinctly in her mind
Shecould not have told herself exactly what it was that disquieted her
Sheonly received the vague sensation of these things as it were breathof wind upon her face confused troublous an indefinite sense ofhostility in the air
The sound of hoofs grinding upon the gravel of the driveway brought herto herself again and withdrawing her gaze from the empty plain ofLos Muertos she saw young Annixter stopping his horse by the carriagesteps
But the sight of him only diverted her mind to the othertrouble
She could not but regard him with aversion
He was one of theconspirators was one of the leaders in the battle that impended nodoubt he had come to make fresh attempt to win over Magnus to theunholy alliance
However there was little trace of enmity in her greeting
Her hair wasstill spread like broad patch of back and she made that her excusefor not getting up
In answer to Annixters embarrassed inquiry afterMagnus she sent the Chinese cook to call him from the office andAnnixter after tying his horse to the ring driven into the trunk of oneof the eucalyptus trees came up to the porch and taking off his hatsat down upon the steps
Is Harran anywhere about he asked
Id like to see Harran tooNo said Mrs Derrick Harran went to Bonneville early this morningShe glanced toward Annixter nervously without turning her head lestshe should disturb her outspread hair
What is it you want to see Mr Derrick about she inquired hastily
Is it about this plan to elect Railroad Commission
Magnus does notapprove of it she declared with energy
He told me so last nightAnnixter moved about awkwardly where he sat smoothing down with hishand the one stiff lock of yellow hair that persistently stood up fromhis crown like an Indians scalplock
At once his suspicions were allaroused
this feemale woman was trying to get hold on him tryingto involve him in petticoat mess trying to cajole him
Upon theinstant he became very crafty an excess of prudence promptly congealedhis natural impulses
In an actual spasm of caution he scarcely trustedhimself to speak terrified lest he should commit himself to something
He glanced about apprehensively praying that Magnus might join themspeedily relieving the tension
came to see about giving dance in my new barn he answeredscowling into the depths of his hat as though reading from notes he hadconcealed there
wanted to ask how should send out the invites
Ithought of just putting an ad
in the Mercury
But as he spoke Presley had come up behind Annixter in time to get thedrift of the conversation and now observedThats nonsense Buck
Youre not giving public ball
You MUST sendout invitationsHello Presley you there exclaimed Annixter turning round
The twoshook hands
Send out invitations repeated Annixter uneasily
Why must IBecause thats the only way to doIt is is it answered Annixter perplexed and troubled
No otherman of his acquaintance could have so contradicted Annixter withoutprovoking quarrel upon the instant
Why the young rancher irascibleobstinate belligerent should invariably defer to the poet was aninconsistency never to be explained
It was with great surprise thatMrs Derrick heard him continueWell suppose you know what youre talking about Pres
Must havewritten invites heyOf courseTypewrittenWhy what an ass you are Buck observed Presley calmly
Beforeyou get through with it you will probably insult threefourths of thepeople you intend to invite and have about hundred quarrels on yourhands and lawsuit or twoHowever before Annixter could reply Magnus came out on the porcherect grave freshly shaven
Without realising what he was doingAnnixter instinctively rose to his feet
It was as though Magnus was acommanderinchief of an unseen army and he subaltern
There was somelittle conversation as to the proposed dance and then Annixter found anexcuse for drawing the Governor aside
Mrs Derrick watched the two witheyes full of poignant anxiety as they slowly paced the length of thegravel driveway to the road gate and stood there leaning upon ittalking earnestly Magnus tall thinlipped impassive one hand in thebreast of his frock coat his head bare his keen blue eyes fixed uponAnnixters face
Annixter came at once to the main point
got wire from Osterman this morning Governor and wellweve gotDisbrow
That means that the Denver Pueblo and Mojave is back of us
Theres half the fight won first offOsterman bribed him suppose observed Magnus
Annixter raised shoulder vexatiously
Youve got to pay for what you get he returned
You dont getsomething for nothing guess
Governor he went on dont see howyou can stay out of this business much longer
You see how it will be
Were going to win and dont see how you can feel that its right ofyou to let us do all the work and stand all the expense
Theres neverbeen movement of any importance that went on around you that youwerent the leader in it
All Tulare County all the San Joaquin forthat matter knows you
They want leader and they are looking to you
know how you feel about politics nowadays
But Governor standardshave changed since your time everybody plays the game now as we areplaying itthe most honourable men
You cant play it any other wayand pshaw
if the right wins out in the end thats the main thing
Wewant you in this thing and we want you bad
Youve been chewing on thisaffair now long time
Have you made up your mind
Do you come in
Itell you what youve got to look at these things in large way
Youvegot to judge by results
Well now what do you think
Do you come inMagnuss glance left Annixters face and for an instant sought theground
His frown lowered but now it was in perplexity rather than inanger
His mind was troubled harassed with thousand dissensions
But one of Magnuss strongest instincts one of his keenest desireswas to be if only for short time the master
To control men hadever been his ambition submission of any kind his greatest horror
Hisenergy stirred within him goaded by the lash of his anger his senseof indignity of insult
Oh for one moment to be able to strike backto crush his enemy to defeat the railroad hold the Corporation in thegrip of his fist put down Behrman rehabilitate himself regain hisselfrespect
To be once more powerful to command to dominate
Histhin lips pressed themselves together the nostrils of his prominenthawklike nose dilated his erect commanding figure stiffenedunconsciously
For moment he saw himself controlling the situationthe foremost figure in his State feared respected thousands ofmen beneath him his ambition at length gratified his career onceapparently brought to naught completed success palpable achievement
What if this were his chance after all come at last after all theseyears
His chance
The instincts of the oldtime gambler the mostredoubtable poker player of El Dorado County stirred at the word
To know it when it came to recognise it as it passed fleet as awindflurry grip at it catch at it blind reckless staking all uponthe hazard of the issue that was genius
Was this his Chance
All ofa sudden it seemed to him that it was
But his honour
His cherishedlifelong integrity the unstained purity of his principles
At this latedate were they to be sacrificed
Could he now go counter to all thefirm built fabric of his character
How afterward could he bear tolook Harran and Lyman in the face

Toseize it meant achievement fame influence prestige possibly greatwealth
am so sorry to interrupt said Mrs Derrick as she came up
hopeMr Annixter will excuse me but want Magnus to open the safe for me
have lost the combination and must have some money
Phelps is goinginto town and want him to pay some bills for me
Cant you come rightaway Magnus
Phelps is ready and waitingAnnixter struck his heel into the ground with suppressed oath
Always these fool feemale women came between him and his plans mixingthemselves up in his affairs
Magnus had been on the very point ofsaying something perhaps committing himself to some course of actionand at precisely the wrong moment his wife had cut in
The opportunitywas lost
The three returned toward the ranch house but before sayinggoodbye Annixter had secured from Magnus promise to the effect thatbefore coming to definite decision in the matter under discussion hewould talk further with him
Presley met him at the porch
He was going into town with Phelps andproposed to Annixter that he should accompany them
want to go over and see old Broderson Annixter objected
But Presley informed him that Broderson had gone to Bonneville earlierin the morning
He had seen him go past in his buckboard
The three menset off Phelps and Annixter on horseback Presley on his bicycle
When they had gone Mrs Derrick sought out her husband in the officeof the ranch house
She was at her prettiest that morning her cheeksflushed with excitement her innocent wideopen eyes almost girlish
She had fastened her hair still moist with black ribbon tied at theback of her head and the soft mass of light brown reached to below herwaist making her look very young
What was it he was saying to you just now she exclaimed as she camethrough the gate in the greenpainted wire railing of the office
Whatwas Mr Annixter saying
He was trying to get you to join himtrying to persuade you to be dishonest wasnt that it
Tell me Magnuswasnt that itMagnus nodded
His wife drew close to him putting hand on his shoulder
But you wont will you
You wont listen to him again you wont somuch as allow himanybodyto even suppose you would lend yourself tobribery
Oh Magnus dont know what has come over you these last fewweeks
Why before this you would have been insulted if any one thoughtyou would even consider anything like dishonesty
Magnus it would breakmy heart if you joined Mr Annixter and Mr Osterman
Why you couldntbe the same man to me afterward you who have kept yourself so cleantill now
And the boys what would Lyman say and Harran and every onewho knows you and respects you if you lowered yourself to be just apolitical adventurerFor moment Derrick leaned his head upon his hand avoiding her gaze
At length he said drawing deep breath am troubled Annie
Theseare the evil days
have much upon my mindEvil days or not she insisted promise me this one thing that youwill not join Mr Annixters scheme She had taken his hand in both ofhers and was looking into his face her pretty eyes full of pleading
Promise me she repeated give me your word
Whatever happens let mealways be able to be proud of you as always have been
Give me yourword
know you never seriously thought of joining Mr Annixter but Iam so nervous and frightened sometimes
Just to relieve my mind Magnusgive me your wordWhyyou are right he answered
No never thought seriously of it
Only for moment was ambitious to beI dont know whatwhat Ihad hoped to be oncewell that is over now
Annie your husband is adisappointed manGive me your word she insisted
We can talk about other thingsafterwardAgain Magnus wavered about to yield to his better instincts and to theentreaties of his wife
He began to see how perilously far he had gonein this business
He was drifting closer to it every hour
Already hewas entangled already his foot was caught in the mesh that was beingspun
Sharply he recoiled
Again all his instincts of honesty revolted
No whatever happened he would preserve his integrity
His wife wasright
Always she had influenced his better side
At that momentMagnuss repugnance of the proposed political campaign was at its pitchof intensity
He wondered how he had ever allowed himself to so muchas entertain the idea of joining with the others
Now he wouldwrench free would in single instant of power clear himself of allcompromising relations
He turned to his wife
Upon his lips trembledthe promise she implored
But suddenly there came to his mind therecollection of his newmade pledge to Annixter
He had given his wordthat before arriving at decision he would have last interview withhim
To Magnus his given word was sacred
Though now he wanted to hecould not as yet draw back could not promise his wife that he woulddecide to do right
The matter must be delayed few days longer
Lamely he explained this to her
Annie Derrick made but little responsewhen he had done
She kissed his forehead and went out of the roomuneasy depressed her mind thronging with vague fears leaving Magnusbefore his office desk his head in his hands thoughtful gloomyassaulted by forebodings
Meanwhile Annixter Phelps and Presley continued on their way towardBonneville
In short time they had turned into the County Road bythe great wateringtank and proceeded onward in the shade of theinterminable line of poplar trees the windbreak that stretched alongthe roadside bordering the Broderson ranch
But as they drew near toCarahers saloon and grocery about half mile outside of Bonnevillethey recognised Harrans horse tied to the railing in front of it
Annixter left the others and went in to see Harran
Harran he said when the two had sat down on either side of one ofthe small tables youve got to make up your mind one way or anotherpretty soon
What are you going to do
Are you going to stand by and seethe rest of the Committee spending money by the bucketful in this thingand keep your hands in your pockets
If we win youll benefit just asmuch as the rest of us
suppose youve got some money of your ownyouhave havent you
You are your fathers manager arent youDisconcerted at Annixters directness Harran stammered an affirmativeaddingIts hard to know just what to do
Its mean position for me Buck
Iwant to help you others but do want to play fair
dont know how toplay any other way
should like to have line from the Governor asto how to act but theres no getting word out of him these days
Heseems to want to let me decide for myselfWell look here put in Annixter
Suppose you keep out of the thingtill its all over and then share and share alike with the Committee oncampaign expensesHarran fell thoughtful his hands in his pockets frowning moodily atthe toe of his boot
There was silence
ThenI dont like to go it blind he hazarded
Im sort of sharing theresponsibility of what you do then
Im silent partner
And thenIdont want to have any difficulties with the Governor
Weve always gotalong well together
He wouldnt like it you know if did anythinglike that Say exclaimed Annixter abruptly if the Governor sayshe will keep his hands off and that you can do as you please will youcome in
For Gods sake let us ranchers act together for once
Letsstand in with each other in ONE fightWithout knowing it Annixter had touched the right spring
dont know but what youre right Harran murmured vaguely
Hissense of discouragement that feeling of whatstheuse was never moreoppressive
All fair means had been tried
The wheat grower was at lastwith his back to the wall
If he chose his own means of fighting theresponsibility must rest upon his enemies not on himself
Its the only way to accomplish anything he continued standing inwith each other well go ahead and see what you can do
If theGovernor is willing Ill come in for my share of the campaign fundThats some sense exclaimed Annixter shaking him by the hand
Halfthe fight is over already
Weve got Disbrow you know and the nextthing is to get hold of some of those rotten San Francisco bosses
Osterman will But Harran interrupted him making quick gesturewith his hand
Dont tell me about it he said
dont want to know what you andOsterman are going to do
If did shouldnt come inYet for all this before they said goodbye Annixter had obtainedHarrans promise that he would attend the next meeting of the Committeewhen Osterman should return from Los Angeles and make his report
Harranwent on toward Los Muertos
Annixter mounted and rode into Bonneville
Bonneville was very lively at all times
It was little city of sometwenty or thirty thousand inhabitants where as yet the city hall thehigh school building and the opera house were objects of civicpride
It was well governed beautifully clean full of the energy andstrenuous young life of new city
An air of the briskest activitypervaded its streets and sidewalks
The business portion of the towncentring about Main Street was always crowded
Annixter arriving atthe Post Office found himself involved in scene of swiftlyshifting sights and sounds
Saddle horses farm wagonsthe inevitableStudebakersbuggies grey with the dust of country roads buckboardswith squashes and grocery packages stowed under the seat twowheeledsulkies and training carts were hitched to the gnawed railings andzincsheathed telegraph poles along the curb
Here and there on theedge of the sidewalk were bicycles wedged into bicycle racks paintedwith cigar advertisements
Upon the asphalt sidewalk itself soft andsticky with the mornings heat was continuous movement
Men withlarge stomachs wearing linen coats but no vests laboured ponderouslyup and down
Girls in lawn skirts shirt waists and garden hats wentto and fro invariably in couples coming in and out of the drug storethe grocery store and haberdashers or lingering in front of the PostOffice which was on corner under the IOOF
Young men inshirt sleeves with brown wicker cuffprotectors over their forearmsand pencils behind their ears bustled in front of the grocery storeanxious and preoccupied
very old man Mexican in ragged whitetrousers and bare feet sat on horseblock in front of the barbershop holding horse by rope around its neck
Chinaman went byteetering under the weight of his market baskets slung on pole acrosshis shoulders
In the neighbourhood of the hotel the Yosemite Housetravelling salesmen drummers for jewelry firms of San Franciscocommercial agents insurance men welldressed metropolitan debonairstood about cracking jokes or hurried in and out of the flapping whitedoors of the Yosemite barroom
The Yosemite bus and City bus passedup the street on the way from the morning train each with its two orthree passengers
very narrow wagon belonging to the Cole ColemoreHarvester Works went by loaded with long strips of iron that made ahorrible din as they jarred over the unevenness of the pavement
Theelectric car line the citys boast did brisk business its carswhirring from end to end of the street with jangling of bells anda moaning plaint of gearing
On the stone bulkheads of the grass plataround the new City Hall the usual loafers sat chewing tobaccoswapping stories
In the park were the inevitable array of nursemaidsskylarking couples and ragged little boys
single policeman in greycoat and helmet friend and acquaintance of every man and woman in thetown stood by the park entrance leaning an elbow on the fence posttwirling his club
But in the centre of the best business block of the street was athreestory building of rough brown stone set off with plate glasswindows and goldlettered signs
One of these latter read Pacific andSouthwestern Railroad Freight and Passenger Office while another muchsmaller beneath the windows of the second story bore the inscriptionP
and Land OfficeAnnixter hitched his horse to the iron post in front of this buildingand tramped up to the second floor letting himself into an officewhere couple of clerks and bookkeepers sat at work behind high wirescreen
One of these latter recognised him and came forward
Hello said Annixter abruptly scowling the while
Is your boss in
Is Ruggles inThe bookkeeper led Annixter to the private office in an adjoining roomushering him through door on the frosted glass of which was paintedthe name Cyrus Blakelee Ruggles Inside man in frock coatshoestring necktie and Stetson hat sat writing at rollertop desk
Over this desk was vast map of the railroad holdings in the countryabout Bonneville and Guadalajara the alternate sections belonging tothe Corporation accurately plotted
Ruggles was cordial in his welcomeof Annixter
He had way of fiddling with his pencil continually whilehe talked scribbling vague lines and fragments of words and names onstray bits of paper and no sooner had Annixter sat down than he hadbegun to write in fullbellied script ANN ANN all over his blottingpad
want to see about those lands of mineI mean of yoursof therailroads Annixter commenced at once
want to know when can buy
Im sick of fooling along like thisWell Mr Annixter observed Ruggles writing great before theANN and finishing it off with flourishing The landshe crossedout one of the Ns and noted the effect with hasty glancethe landsare practically yours
You have an option on them indefinitely and asit is you dont have to pay the taxesRot your option
want to own them Annixter declared
What have youpeople got to gain by putting off selling them to us
Here this thinghas dragged along for over eight years
When came in on Quien Sabethe understanding was that the landsyour alternate sectionswere tobe conveyed to me within few monthsThe land had not been patented to us then answered Ruggles
Well it has been now guess retorted Annixter
Im sure couldnt tell you Mr AnnixterAnnixter crossed his legs weariedly
Oh whats the good of lying Ruggles
You know better than to talkthat way to meRuggless face flushed on the instant but he checked his answer andlaughed instead
Oh if you know so much about it he observed
Well when are you going to sell to meIm only acting for the General Office Mr Annixter returnedRuggles
Whenever the Directors are ready to take that matter up Illbe only too glad to put it through for youAs if you didnt know
Look here youre not talking to old Broderson
Wake up Ruggles
Whats all this talk in Genslingers rag about thegrading of the value of our lands this winter and an advance in thepriceRuggles spread out his hands with deprecatory gesture
dont own the Mercury he said
Well your company doesIf it does dont know anything about itOh rot
As if you and Genslinger and Behrman didnt run the wholeshow down here
Come on lets have it Ruggles
What does Behrmanpay Genslinger for inserting that threeinch ad
of the and inhis paper
Ten thousand year heyOh why not hundred thousand and be done with it returned theother willing to take it as joke
Instead of replying Annixter drew his checkbook from his insidepocket
Let me take that fountain pen of yours he said
Holding the book onhis knee he wrote out check tore it carefully from the stub and laidit on the desk in front of Ruggles
Whats this asked Ruggles
Threefourths payment for the sections of railroad land included in myranch based on valuation of two dollars and half per acre
You canhave the balance in sixtyday notesRuggles shook his head drawing hastily back from the check as though itcarried contamination
cant touch it he declared
Ive no authority to sell to you yetI dont understand you people exclaimed Annixter
offered to buyof you the same way four years ago and you sang the same song
Why itisnt business
You lose the interest on your money
Seven per cent
ofthat capital for four yearsyou can figure it out
Its big moneyWell then dont see why youre so keen on parting with it
You canget seven per cent
the same as usI want to own my own land returned Annixter
want to feel thatevery lump of dirt inside my fence is my personal property
Why thevery house live in nowthe ranch housestands on railroad groundBut youve an optionI tell you dont want your cursed option
want ownership and itsthe same with Magnus Derrick and old Broderson and Osterman and all theranchers of the county
We want to own our land want to feel we can doas we blame please with it
Suppose should want to sell Quien Sabe
Icant sell it as whole till Ive bought of you
cant give anybody aclear title
The land has doubled in value ten times over again since Icame in on it and improved it
Its worth easily twenty an acre now
ButI cant take advantage of that rise in value so long as you wont sellso long as dont own it
Youre blocking meBut according to you the railroad cant take advantage of the rise inany case
According to you you can sell for twenty dollars but we canonly get two and halfWho made it worth twenty cried Annixter
Ive improved it up tothat figure
Genslinger seems to have that idea in his nut too
Do youpeople think you can hold that land untaxed for speculative purposesuntil it goes up to thirty dollars and then sell out to some oneelsesell it over our heads
You and Genslinger werent in office whenthose contracts were drawn
You ask your boss you ask Behrman heknows
The General Office is pledged to sell to us in preference to anyone else for two and halfWell observed Ruggles decidedly tapping the end of his pencil on hisdesk and leaning forward to emphasise his words were not selling NOW
Thats said and signed Mr AnnixterWhy not
Come spit it out
Whats the bunco game this timeBecause were not ready
Heres your checkYou wont take itNoIll make it cash payment money downthe whole of itpayable toCyrus Blakelee Ruggles for the and WNoThird and last timeNoOh go to the devilI dont like your tone Mr Annixter returned Ruggles flushingangrily
dont give curse whether you like it or not retortedAnnixter rising and thrusting the check into his pocket but never youmind Mr Ruggles you and Behrman and Genslinger and Shelgrim andthe whole gang of thieves of youyoull wake this State of Californiaup some of these days by going just one little bit too far and therellbe an election of Railroad Commissioners of by and for the peoplethatll get twist of you my buncosteering friendyou and yourbackers and cappers and swindlers and thimbleriggers and smash youlock stock and barrel
Thats my tip to you and be damned to you MrCyrus Blackleg RugglesAnnixter stormed out of the room slamming the door behind him andRuggles trembling with anger turned to his desk and to the blottingpad written all over with the words LANDS TWENTY DOLLARS TWO AND AHALF OPTION and over and over again with great swelling curves andflourishes RAILROAD RAILROAD RAILROAD
But as Annixter passed into the outside office on the other side ofthe wire partition he noted the figure of man at the counter inconversation with one of the clerks
There was something familiar toAnnixters eye about the mans heavy built frame his great shouldersand massive back and as he spoke to the clerk in tremendous rumblingvoice Annixter promptly recognised Dyke
There was meeting
Annixter liked Dyke as did every one else inand about Bonneville
He paused now to shake hands with the dischargedengineer and to ask about his little daughter Sidney to whom he knewDyke was devotedly attached
Smartest little tad in Tulare County asserted Dyke
Shes gettingprettier every day Mr Annixter
THERES little tad that was justborn to be lady
Can recite the whole of Snow Bound without everstopping
You dont believe that maybe hey
Well its true
Shell bejust old enough to enter the Seminary up at Marysville next winter andif my hop business pays two per cent
on the investment theres whereshes going to goHows it coming on inquired Annixter
The hop ranch
Ive about got the land in shape and Iveengaged foreman who knows all about hops
Ive been in luck
Everybodywill go into the business next year when they see hops go to dollarand theyll overstock the market and bust the price
But Im going toget the cream of it now
say two per cent
Why Lord love you itwill pay good deal more than that
Its got to
Its cost more thanI figured to start the thing so perhaps may have to borrowsomewheres but then on such sure game as thisand do want to makesomething out of that little tad of mineThrough here inquired Annixter making ready to move off
In just minute answered Dyke
Wait for me and Ill walk down thestreet with youAnnixter grumbled that he was in hurry but waited neverthelesswhile Dyke again approached the clerk
shall want some empty cars of you people this fall he explained
Im hopraiser now and just want to make sure what your rates onhops are
Ive been told but want to make sure
Savvy There was along delay while the clerk consulted the tariff schedules and Annixterfretted impatiently
Dyke growing uneasy leaned heavily on his elbowswatching the clerk anxiously
If the tariff was exorbitant he saw hisplans brought to naught his money jeopardised the little tad Sidneydeprived of her education
He began to blame himself that he had notlong before determined definitely what the railroad would charge formoving his hops
He told himself he was not much of business man thathe managed carelessly
Two cents suddenly announced the clerk with certain surlyindifference
Two cents poundYes two cents poundthats in carload lots of course
wontgive you that rate on smaller consignmentsYes carload lots of course two cents
Well all rightHe turned away with great sigh of relief
He sure did have me scared for minute he said to Annixter as thetwo went down to the street fiddling and fussing so long
Two centsis all right though
Seems fair to me
That fiddling of his was allput on
know em these railroad heelers
He knew was dischargedemployee first off and he played the game just to make me seem smallbecause had to ask favours of him
dont suppose the General Officetips its slavees off to act like swine but theres the feeling throughthe whole herd of them
Ye got to come to us
We let ye live only solong as we choose and what are ye going to do about it
If ye dontlike it git out
Annixter and the engineer descended to the street and had drink at theYosemite bar and Annixter went into the General Store while Dykebought little pair of red slippers for Sidney
Before the salesman hadwrapped them up Dyke slipped dime into the toe of each with wink atAnnixter
Let the little tad find em there he said behind his hand in hoarsewhisper
Thatll be one on SidWhere to now demanded Annixter as they regained the street
Imgoing down to the Post Office and then pull out for the ranch
Going mywayDyke hesitated in some confusion tugging at the ends of his fine blondebeard
No no
guess Ill leave you here
Ive gotgot other things to doup the street
So longThe two separated and Annixter hurried through the crowd to the PostOffice but the mail that had come in on that mornings train wasunusually heavy
It was nearly half an hour before it was distributed
Naturally enough Annixter placed all the blame of the delay upon therailroad and delivered himself of some pointed remarks in the midst ofthe waiting crowd
He was irritated to the last degree when he finallyemerged upon the sidewalk again cramming his mail into his pockets
Onecause of his bad temper was the fact that in the bundle of Quien Sabeletters was one to Hilma Tree in mans handwriting
Huh Annixter had growled to himself that pip Delaney
Seems nowthat Im to act as gobetween for em
Well maybe that feemale girlgets this letter and then again maybe she dontBut suddenly his attention was diverted
Directly opposite the PostOffice upon the corner of the street stood quite the best businessbuilding of which Bonneville could boast
It was built of Colusagranite very solid ornate imposing
Upon the heavy plate of thewindow of its main floor in gold and red letters one read the wordsLoan and Savings Bank of Tulare County It was of this bank that SBehrman was president
At the street entrance of the building was acurved sign of polished brass fixed upon the angle of the masonry thissign bore the name
Behrman and under it in smaller letters werethe words Real Estate MortgagesAs Annixters glance fell upon this building he was surprised to seeDyke standing upon the curb in front of it apparently reading from anewspaper that he held in his hand
But Annixter promptly discoveredthat he was not reading at all
From time to time the former engineershot swift glance out of the corner of his eye up and down the street
Annixter jumped at conclusion
An idea suddenly occurred to him
Dykewas watching to see if he was observedwas waiting an opportunity whenno one who knew him should be in sight
Annixter stepped back littlegetting telegraph pole somewhat between him and the other
Veryinterested he watched what was going on
Pretty soon Dyke thrustthe paper into his pocket and sauntered slowly to the windows of astationery store next the street entrance of Behrmans offices
Fora few seconds he stood there his back turned seemingly absorbed inthe display but eyeing the street narrowly nevertheless then he turnedaround gave last look about and stepped swiftly into the doorwayby the great brass sign
He disappeared
Annixter came from behind thetelegraph pole with flush of actual shame upon his face
There hadbeen something so slinking so mean in the movements and manner of thisgreat burly honest fellow of an engineer that he could not help butfeel ashamed for him
Circumstances were such that simple businesstransaction was to Dyke almost culpable degradation thing to beconcealed
Borrowing money of Behrman commented Annixter mortgaging yourlittle homestead to the railroad putting your neck in the halter
The pity of it
Good Lord your hops must pay you big now oldmanAnnixter lunched at the Yosemite Hotel and then later on toward themiddle of the afternoon rode out of the town at canter by the wayof the Upper Road that paralleled the railroad tracks and that randiametrically straight between Bonneville and Guadalajara
Abouthalfway between the two places he overtook Father Sarria trudging backto San Juan his long cassock powdered with dust
He had wicker cratein one hand and in the other in small square valise the materialsfor the Holy Sacrament
Since early morning the priest had coverednearly fifteen miles on foot in order to administer Extreme Unction toa moribund goodfornothing greaser half Indian half Portuguesewho lived in remote corner of Ostermans stock range at the head ofa canon there
But he had returned by way of Bonneville to get cratethat had come for him from San Diego
He had been notified of itsarrival the day before
Annixter pulled up and passed the time of day with the priest
dont often get up your way he said slowing down his horse toaccommodate Sarrias deliberate plodding
Sarria wiped the perspirationfrom his smooth shiny face
Well with you it is different he answered
But there are agreat many Catholics in the countysome on your ranch
And so few cometo the Mission
At High Mass on Sundays there are fewMexicans andSpaniards from Guadalajara mostly but weekdays for matins vespersand the like often say the offices to an empty churchthe voiceof one crying in the wilderness
You Americans are not good churchmen
Sundays you sleepyou read the newspapersWell theres Vanamee observed Annixter
suppose hes there earlyand lateSarria made sharp movement of interest
Ah Vanameea strange lad wonderful character for all that
Ifthere were only more like him
am troubled about him
You know am avery owl at night
come and go about the Mission at all hours
Withinthe week three times have seen Vanamee in the little garden by theMission and at the dead of night
He had come without asking for me
Hedid not see me
It was strange
Once when had got up at dawn to ringfor early matins saw him stealing away out of the garden
He musthave been there all the night
He is acting queerly
He is pale hischeeks are more sunken than ever
There is something wrong with him
Icant make it out
It is mystery
Suppose you ask himNot Ive enough to bother myself about
Vanamee is crazy in thehead
Some morning he will turn up missing again and drop out of sightfor another three years
Best let him alone Sarria
Hes crank
Howis that greaser of yours up on Ostermans stock rangeAh the poor fellowthe poor fellow returned the other the tearscoming to his eyes
He died this morningas you might say in my armspainfully but in the faith in the faith
good fellowA lazy cattlestealing knifeinhisboot DagoYou misjudge him
really good fellow on better acquaintanceAnnixter grunted scornfully
Sarrias kindness and goodwill toward themost outrageous reprobates of the ranches was proverbial
He practicallysupported some halfdozen families that lived in forgotten cabins lostand all but inaccessible in the far corners of stock range andcanyon
This particular greaser was the laziest the dirtiest the mostworthless of the lot
But in Sarrias mind the lout was an object ofaffection sincere unquestioning
Thrice week the priest with abasket of provisionscold ham bottle of wine olives loaves ofbread even chicken or twotoiled over the interminable stretch ofcountry between the Mission and his cabin
Of late during the rascalssickness these visits had been almost daily
Hardly once did the priestleave the bedside that he did not slip halfdollar into the palm ofhis wife or oldest daughter
And this was but one case out of many
His kindliness toward animals was the same
horde of mangecorrodedcurs lived off his bounty wolfish ungrateful often marking him withtheir teeth yet never knowing the meaning of harsh word
burrooverfed lazy incorrigible browsed on the hill back of the Missionobstinately refusing to be harnessed to Sarrias little cart squealingand biting whenever the attempt was made and the priest suffered himsubmitting to his humour inventing excuses for him alleging that theburro was foundered or was in need of shoes or was feeble from extremeage
The two peacocks magnificent proud coldhearted resenting allfamiliarity he served with the timorous apologetic affection of aqueens ladyinwaiting resigned to their disdain happy if only theycondescended to enjoy the grain he spread for them
At the Long Trestle Annixter and the priest left the road and took thetrail that crossed Broderson Creek by the clumps of greygreen willowsand led across Quien Sabe to the ranch house and to the Mission fartheron
They were obliged to proceed in single file here and Annixterwho had allowed the priest to go in front promptly took notice of thewicker basket he carried
Upon his inquiry Sarria became confused
Itwas basket that he had had sent down to him from the cityWell knowbut whats in itWhyIm sureah poultrya chicken or twoFancy breedYes yes thats it fancy breed At the ranch house where theyarrived toward five oclock Annixter insisted that the priest shouldstop long enough for glass of sherry
Sarria left the basket and hissmall black valise at the foot of the porch steps and sat down in arocker on the porch itself fanning himself with his broadbrimmed hatand shaking the dust from his cassock
Annixter brought out the decanterof sherry and glasses and the two drank to each others health
But as the priest set down his glass wiping his lips with murmur ofsatisfaction the decrepit Irish setter that had attached himselfto Annixters house came out from underneath the porch and nosedvigorously about the wicker basket
He upset it
The little peg holdingdown the cover slipped the basket fell sideways opening as it felland cock his head enclosed in little chamois bag such as are usedfor gold watches struggled blindly out into the open air
secondsimilarly hooded followed
The pair stupefied in their headgear stoodrigid and bewildered in their tracks clucking uneasily
Their tailswere closely sheared
Their legs thickly muscled and extraordinarilylong were furnished with enormous cruellooking spurs
The breedwas unmistakable
Annixter looked once at the pair then shouted withlaughter
Poultrya chicken or twofancy breedho
yes should thinkso
Game cocks
Fighting cocks
Oh you old rat
Youll be dry nurseto burro and keep hospital for infirm puppies but you will fightgame cocks
Oh Lord
Why Sarria this is as good grind as everheard
Theres the Spanish cropping out after allSpeechless with chagrin the priest bundled the cocks into the basketand catching up the valise took himself abruptly away almost runningtill he had put himself out of hearing of Annixters raillery
And eventen minutes later when Annixter still chuckling stood upon the porchsteps he saw the priest far in the distance climbing the slope ofthe high ground in the direction of the Mission still hurrying on ata great pace his cassock flapping behind him his head bent toAnnixters notion the very picture of discomfiture and confusion
As Annixter turned about to reenter the house he found himself almostface to face with Hilma Tree
She was just going in at the doorway anda great flame of the sunset shooting in under the eaves of the porchenveloped her from her head with its thick moist hair that hung lowover her neck to her slim feet setting golden flash in the littlesteel buckles of her low shoes
She had come to set the table forAnnixters supper
Taken all aback by the suddenness of the encounterAnnixter ejaculated an abrupt and senseless Excuse me But Hilmawithout raising her eyes passed on unmoved into the diningroomleaving Annixter trying to find his breath and fumbling with the brimof his hat that he was surprised to find he had taken from his head
Resolutely and taking quick advantage of his opportunity he followedher into the diningroom
see that dog has turned up he announced with brisk cheerfulness
That Irish setter was asking aboutHilma swift pink flush deepening the delicate rose of her cheeksdid not reply except by nodding her head
She flung the tablecloth outfrom under her arms across the table spreading it smooth with quicklittle caresses of her hands
There was moments silence
ThenAnnixter saidHeres letter for you He laid it down on the table near her andHilma picked it up
And see here Miss Hilma Annixter continuedabout thatthis morningI suppose you think am firstclassmucker
If it will do any good to apologise why will
want to befriends with you
made bad mistake and started in the wrong way
dont know much about women people
want you to forget aboutthatthis morning and not think am galoot and mucker
Will youdo it
Will you be friends with meHilma set the plate and coffee cup by Annixters place before answeringand Annixter repeated his question
Then she drew deep quick breaththe flush in her cheeks returning
think it wasit was so wrong of you she murmured
you dontknow how it hurt me
criedoh for an hourWell thats just it returned Annixter vaguely moving his headuneasily
didnt know what kind of girl you wereI mean madea mistake
thought it didnt make much difference
thought allfeemales were about alikeI hope you know now murmured Hilma ruefully
Ive paid enough tohave you find out
criedyou dont know
Why it hurt me worse thananything can remember
hope you know now Well do know now heexclaimed
It wasnt so much that you tried to dowhat you did answered Hilmathe single deep swell from her waist to her throat rising and falling inher emotion
It was that you thought that you couldthat anybody couldthat wanted tothat held myself so cheap
Oh she cried with asudden sobbing catch in her throat never can forget it and youdont know what it means to girlWell thats just what do want he repeated
want you to forgetit and have us be good friendsIn his embarrassment Annixter could think of no other words
He keptreiterating again and again during the pauses of the conversationI want you to forget it
Will you
Will you forget itthatthismorning and have us be good friendsHe could see that her trouble was keen
He was astonished that thematter should be so grave in her estimation
After all what was it thata girl should be kissed
But he wanted to regain his lost ground
Will you forget it Miss Hilma
want you to like meShe took clean napkin from the sideboard drawer and laid it down bythe plate
II do want you to like me persisted Annixter
want you to forgetall about this business and like meHilma was silent
Annixter saw the tears in her eyes
How about that
Will you forget it
Will youwillwill you LIKE meShe shook her head
No she said
No what
You wont like me
Is that itHilma blinking at the napkin through her tears nodded to say Yesthat was it
Annixter hesitated moment frowning harassed andperplexed
You dont like me at all heyAt length Hilma found her speech
In her low voice lower and morevelvety than ever she saidNoI dont like you at allThen as the tears suddenly overpowered her she dashed hand acrossher eyes and ran from the room and out of doors
Annixter stood for moment thoughtful his protruding lower lip thrustout his hands in his pocket
suppose shell quit now he muttered
Suppose shell leave theranchif she hates me like that
Well she can gothats allshe cango
Fool feemale girl he muttered between his teeth petticoat mess He was about to sit down to his supper when his eye fell upon theIrish setter on his haunches in the doorway
There was an expectantingratiating look on the dogs face
No doubt he suspected it was timefor eating
Get outYOU roared Annixter in tempest of wrath
The dog slunk back his tail shut down close his ears drooping butinstead of running away he lay down and rolled supinely upon his backthe very image of submission tame abject disgusting
It was the onething to drive Annixter to fury
He kicked the dog off the porch ina rolling explosion of oaths and flung himself down to his seat beforethe table fuming and panting
Damn the dog and the girl and the whole rotten businessand now heexclaimed as sudden fancied qualm arose in his stomach now itsall made me sick
Might have known it
Oh it only lacked that to windup the whole day
Let her go dont care and the sooner the betterHe countermanded the supper and went to bed before it was dark lightinghis lamp on the chair near the head of the bed and opening hisCopperfield at the place marked by the strip of paper torn from thebag of prunes
For upward of an hour he read the novel methodicallyswallowing one prune every time he reached the bottom of page
Aboutnine oclock he blew out the lamp and punching up his pillow settledhimself for the night
Then as his mind relaxed in that strange hypnotic condition thatcomes just before sleep series of pictures of the days doings passedbefore his imagination like the roll of kinetoscope
First it was Hilma Tree as he had seen her in thedairyhousecharming delicious radiant of youth her thick whiteneck with its pale amber shadows under the chin her wide open eyesrimmed with fine black lashes the deep swell of her breast and hipsthe delicate lustrous floss on her cheek impalpable as the pollen ofa flower
He saw her standing there in the scintillating light of themorning her smooth arms wet with milk redolent and fragrant of milkher whole desirable figure moving in the golden glory of the sunsteeped in lambent flame saturated with it glowing with it joyousas the dawn itself
Then it was Los Muertos and Hooven the sordid little Dutchman grimedwith the soil he worked in yet vividly remembering period of militaryglory exciting himself with recollections of Gravelotte and theKaiser but contented now in the country of his adoption defining theFatherland as the place where wife and children lived
Then came theranch house of Los Muertos under the grove of cypress and eucalyptuswith its smooth gravelled driveway and wellgroomed lawns Mrs Derrickwith her wideopened eyes that so easily took on look of uneasinessof innocence of anxious inquiry her face still pretty her brown hairthat still retained so much of its brightness spread over her chairback drying in the sun Magnus erect as an officer of cavalrysmoothshaven grey thinlipped imposing with his hawklike nose andforwardcurling grey hair Presley with his dark face delicate mouthand sensitive loose lips in corduroys and laced boots smokingcigarettesan interesting figure suggestive of mixed origin morbidexcitable melancholy brooding upon things that had no names
Thenit was Bonneville with the gayety and confusion of Main Streetthe whirring electric cars the zincsheathed telegraph poles thebuckboards with squashes stowed under the seats Ruggles in frock coatStetson hat and shoestring necktie writing abstractedly upon hisblotting pad Dyke the engineer bigboned
Powerful deepvoicedgoodnatured with his fine blonde beard and massive arms rehearsingthe praises of his little daughter Sidney guided only by the oneambition that she should be educated at seminary slipping dime intothe toe of her diminutive slipper then later overwhelmed with shameslinking into Behrmans office to mortgage his homestead to theheeler of the corporation that had discharged him
By suggestionAnnixter saw Behrman too fat with vast stomach the check andneck meeting to form great tremulous jowl the roll of fat over hiscollar sprinkled with sparse stiff hairs saw his brown roundtoppedhat of varnished straw the linen vest stamped with innumerableinterlocked horseshoes the heavy watch chain clinking against thepearl vest buttons invariably placid unruffled never losing histemper serene unassailable enthroned
Then at the end of all it was the ranch again seen in last briefglance before he had gone to bed the fecundated earth calm at lastnursing the emplanted germ of life ruddy with the sunset the horizonspurple the small clamour of the day lapsing into quiet the greatstill twilight building itself domelike toward the zenith
The barnfowls were roosting in the trees near the stable the horses crunchingtheir fodder in the stalls the days work ceasing by slow degrees andthe priest the Spanish churchman Father Sarria relic of departedregime kindly benign believing in all goodness lover of hisfellows and of dumb animals yet for all that hurrying away inconfusion and discomfiture carrying in one hand the vessels of the HolyCommunion and in the other basket of game cocks
CHAPTER VIIt was high noon and the rays of the sun that hung poised directlyoverhead in an intolerable white glory fell straight as plummets uponthe roofs and streets of Guadalajara
The adobe walls and sparse bricksidewalks of the drowsing town radiated the heat in an oily quiveringshimmer
The leaves of the eucalyptus trees around the Plaza droopedmotionless limp and relaxed under the scorching searching blaze
The shadows of these trees had shrunk to their smallest circumferencecontracting close about the trunks
The shade had dwindled to thebreadth of mere line
The sun was everywhere
The heat exhalingfrom brick and plaster and metal met the heat that steadily descendedblanketwise and smothering from the pale scorched sky
Only thelizardsthey lived in chinks of the crumbling adobe and in intersticesof the sidewalkremained without motionless as if stuffed their eyesclosed to mere slits basking stupefied with heat
At long intervalsthe prolonged drone of an insect developed out of the silence vibrateda moment in soothing somnolent long note then trailed slowly intothe quiet again
Somewhere in the interior of one of the dobe houses aguitar snored and hummed sleepily
On the roof of the hotel group ofpigeons cooed incessantly with subdued liquid murmurs very plaintivea cat perfectly white with pink nose and thin pink lips dozedcomplacently on fence rail full in the sun
In corner of the Plazathree hens wallowed in the baking hot dust their wings flutteringclucking comfortably
And this was all
Sunday repose prevailed the whole moribund townpeaceful profound
certain pleasing numbness sense of gratefulenervation exhaled from the scorching plaster
There was no movement nosound of human business
The faint hum of the insect the intermittentmurmur of the guitar the mellow complainings of the pigeons theprolonged purr of the white cat the contented clucking of thehensall these noises mingled together to form faint drowsy bourdonprolonged stupefying suggestive of an infinite quiet of calmcomplacent life centuries old lapsing gradually to its end under thegorgeous loneliness of cloudless pale blue sky and the steady fire ofan interminable sun
In Solotaris SpanishMexican restaurant Vanamee and Presley satopposite each other at one of the tables near the door bottle ofwhite wine tortillas and an earthen pot of frijoles between them
Theywere the sole occupants of the place
It was the day that Annixter hadchosen for his barndance and in consequence Quien Sabe was in feteand work suspended
Presley and Vanamee had arranged to spend the day ineach others company lunching at Solotaris and taking long tramp inthe afternoon
For the moment they sat back in their chairs their mealall but finished
Solotari brought black coffee and small carafe ofmescal and retiring to corner of the room went to sleep
All through the meal Presley had been wondering over certain change heobserved in his friend
He looked at him again
Vanamees lean spare face was of an olive pallor
His long black hairsuch as one sees in the saints and evangelists of the preRaphaeliteartists hung over his ears
Presley again remarked his pointed beardblack and fine growing from the hollow cheeks
He looked at his facea face like that of young seer like halfinspired shepherd ofthe Hebraic legends dweller in the wilderness gifted with strangepowers
He was dressed as when Presley had first met him herding hissheep in brown canvas overalls thrust into top boots grey flannelshirt open at the throat showing the breast ruddy with tan the waistencircled with cartridge belt empty of cartridges
But now as Presley took more careful note of him he was surprised toobserve certain new look in Vanamees deepset eyes
He remembered nowthat all through the morning Vanamee had been singularly reserved
He was continually drifting into reveries abstracted distrait
Indubitably something of moment had happened
At length Vanamee spoke
Leaning back in his chair his thumbs in hisbelt his bearded chin upon his breast his voice was the even monotoneof one speaking in his sleep
He told Presley in few words what had happened during the firstnight he had spent in the garden of the old Mission of the Answerhalffancied halfreal that had come to him
To no other person but you would speak of this he said but youI think will understandwill be sympathetic at least and feel theneed of unburdening myself of it to some one
At first would not trustmy own senses
was sure had deceived myself but on secondnight it happened again
Then was afraidor no not afraid butdisturbedoh shaken to my very hearts core
resolved to go nofurther in the matter never again to put it to test
For long time Istayed away from the Mission occupying myself with my work keepingit out of my mind
But the temptation was too strong
One night foundmyself there again under the black shadow of the pear trees calling forAngele summoning her from out the dark from out the night
This timethe Answer was prompt unmistakable
cannot explain to you what itwas nor how it came to me for there was no sound
saw absolutelynothing but the empty night
There was no moon
But somewhere off thereover the little valley far off the darkness was troubled that MEthat went out upon my thoughtout from the Mission garden out over thevalley calling for her searching for her found dont know whatbut found resting placea companion
Three times since then havegone to the Mission garden at night
Last night was the third timeHe paused his eyes shining with excitement
Presley leaned forwardtoward him motionless with intense absorption
Welland last night he prompted
Vanamee stirred in his seat his glance fell he drummed an instant uponthe table
Last night he answered there wasthere was change
The Answerwas he drew deep breathnearerYou are sureThe other smiled with absolute certainty
It was not that found the Answer sooner easier
could not bemistaken
No that which has troubled the darkness that which hasentered into the empty nightis coming nearer to mephysically neareractually nearerHis voice sank again
His face like the face of younger prophets theseers took on halfinspired expression
He looked vaguely before himwith unseeing eyes
Suppose he murmured suppose stand there under the pear treesat night and call her again and again and each time the Answer comesnearer and nearer and wait until at last one night the supreme nightof all shesheSuddenly the tension broke
With sharp cry and violent uncertaingesture of the hand Vanamee came to himself
Oh he exclaimed what is it
Do dare
What does it mean
There aretimes when it appals me and there are times when it thrills me witha sweetness and happiness that have not known since she died
Thevagueness of it
How can explain it to you this that happens when Icall to her across the nightthat faint faroff unseen tremble in thedarkness that intangible scarcely perceptible stir
Something neitherheard nor seen appealing to sixth sense only
Listen it is somethinglike this On Quien Sabe all last week we have been seeding the earth
The grain is there now under the earth buried in the dark in the blackstillness under the clods
Can you imagine the firstthe very firstlittle quiver of life that the grain of wheat must feel after it issown when it answers to the call of the sun down there in the dark ofthe earth blind deaf the very first stir from the inert long longbefore any physical change has occurredlong before the microscopecould discover the slightest changewhen the shell first tightens withthe first faint premonition of life
Well it is something as illusiveas that He paused again dreaming lost in reverie then just abovea whisper murmuredThat which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and sheAngele diedYou could not have been mistaken said Presley
You were sure thatthere was something
Imagination can do so much and the influence of thesurroundings was strong
How impossible it would be that anything SHOULDhappen
And you say you heard nothing saw nothingI believe answered Vanamee in sixth sense or rather wholesystem of other unnamed senses beyond the reach of our understanding
People who live much alone and close to nature experience the sensationof it
Perhaps it is something fundamental that we share with plants andanimals
The same thing that sends the birds south long before the firstcolds the same thing that makes the grain of wheat struggle up to meetthe sun
And this sense never deceives
You may see wrong hear wrongbut once touch this sixth sense and it acts with absolute fidelity youare certain
No hear nothing in the Mission garden
see nothingnothing touches me but am CERTAIN for all thatPresley hesitated for moment then he askedShall you go back to the garden again
Make the test again dontknowStrange enough commented Presley wondering
Vanamee sank back in his chair his eyes growing vacant againStrange enough he murmured
There was long silence
Neither spoke nor moved
There in thatmoribund ancient town wrapped in its siesta flagellated with heatdeserted ignored baking in noonday silence these two strange menthe one poet by nature the other by training both out of tune withtheir world dreamers introspective morbid lost and unfamiliar atthat endofthecentury time searching for sign groping and baffledamidst the perplexing obscurity of the Delusion sat over empty wineglasses silent with the pervading silence that surrounded them hearingonly the cooing of doves and the drone of bees the quiet so profoundthat at length they could plainly distinguish at intervals the puffingand coughing of locomotive switching cars in the station yard ofBonneville
It was no doubt this jarring sound that at length roused Presley fromhis lethargy
The two friends rose Solotari very sleepily came forwardthey paid for the luncheon and stepping out into the heat and glare ofthe streets of the town passed on through it and took the road that lednorthward across corner of Dykes hop fields
They were bound for thehills in the northeastern corner of Quien Sabe
It was the same walkwhich Presley had taken on the previous occasion when he had first metVanamee herding the sheep
This encompassing detour around the wholecountryside was favorite pastime of his and he was anxious thatVanamee should share his pleasure in it
But soon after leaving Guadalajara they found themselves upon the landthat Dyke had bought and upon which he was to raise his famous crop ofhops
Dykes house was close at hand very pleasant little cottagepainted white with green blinds and deep porches while near it and yetin process of construction were two great storehouses and drying andcuring house where the hops were to be stored and treated
All aboutwere evidences that the former engineer had already been hard atwork
The ground had been put in readiness to receive the crop and abewildering innumerable multitude of poles connected with maze ofwire and twine had been set out
Farther on at turn of the road theycame upon Dyke himself driving farm wagon loaded with more poles
He was in his shirt sleeves his massive hairy arms bare to the elbowglistening with sweat red with heat
In his belllike rumbling voicehe was calling to his foreman and boy at work in stringing the polestogether
At sight of Presley and Vanamee he hailed them joviallyaddressing them as boys and insisting that they should get into thewagon with him and drive to the house for glass of beer
His motherhad only the day before returned from Marysville where she had beenlooking up seminary for the little tad
She would be delighted to seethe two boys besides Vanamee must see how the little tad had grownsince he last set eyes on her wouldnt know her for the same littlegirl and the beer had been on ice since morning
Presley and Vanameecould not well refuse
They climbed into the wagon and jolted over the uneven ground throughthe bare forest of hoppoles to the house
Inside they found MrsDyke an old lady with very gentle face who wore cap and veryoldfashioned gown with hoop skirts dusting the whatnot in corner ofthe parlor
The two men were presented and the beer was had from off theice
Mother said Dyke as he wiped the froth from his great blond beardaint Sid anywheres about
want Mr Vanamee to see how she has grown
Smartest little tad in Tulare County boys
Can recite the whole ofSnow Bound end to end without skipping or looking at the book
Maybeyou dont believe that
Mother aint rightwithout skipping lineheyMrs Dyke nodded to say that it was so but explained that Sidney wasin Guadalajara
In putting on her new slippers for the first time themorning before she had found dime in the toe of one of them and hadhad the whole house by the ears ever since till she could spend it
Was it for licorice to make her licorice water inquired Dyke gravely
Yes said Mrs Dyke
made her tell me what she was going to getbefore she went and it was licoriceDyke though his mother protested that he was foolish and that Presleyand Vanamee had no great interest in young ones insisted upon showingthe visitors Sidneys copybooks
They were monuments of laboriouselaborate neatness the trite moralities and readymade aphorisms of thephilanthropists and publicists repeated from page to page with wearyinginsistence
too am an American Citizen
As the Twig isBent the Tree is Inclined Truth Crushed to Earth Will Rise Again As for Me Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death and last of all astrange intrusion amongst the mild wellworn phrases two legends
MymottoPublic Control of Public Franchises and The and isan Enemy of the StateI see commented Presley you mean the little tad to understand thesituation earlyI told him he was foolish to give that to Sid to copy said MrsDyke with indulgent remonstrance
What can she understand of publicfranchisesNever mind observed Dyke shell remember it when she grows up andwhen the seminary people have rubbed her up bit and then shellbegin to ask questions and understand
And dont you make any mistakemother he went on about the little tad not knowing who her dadsenemies are
What do you think boys
Listen here
Precious little Iveever told her of the railroad or how was turned off but the otherday was working down by the fence next the railroad tracks and Sid wasthere
Shed brought her doll rags down and she was playing house behinda pile of hop poles
Well along comes through freightmixed trainfrom Missouri points and string of empties from New Orleansand whenit had passed what do you suppose the tad did
SHE didnt know waswatching her
She goes to the fence and spits little spit after thecaboose and puts out her little head and if youll believe me HISSESat the train and mother says she does that same every time she sees atrain go by and never crosses the tracks that she dont spit her littlespit on em
What do you THINK of THATBut correct her every time protested Mrs Dyke seriously
Whereshe picked up the trick of hissing dont know
No its not funny
Itseems dreadful to see little girl whos as sweet and gentle as canbe in every other way so venomous
She says the other little girls atschool and the boys too are all the same way
Oh dear she sighedwhy will the General Office be so unkind and unjust
Why couldntbe happy with all the money in the world if thought that even onelittle child hated mehated me so that it would spit and hiss at me
And its not one child its all of them so Sidney says and think ofall the grown people who hate the road women and men the whole countythe whole State thousands and thousands of people
Dont the managersand the directors of the road ever think of that
Dont they ever thinkof all the hate that surrounds them everywhere everywhere and thegood people that just grit their teeth when the name of the road ismentioned
Why do they want to make the people hate them
No shemurmured the tears starting to her eyes No tell you Mr Presleythe men who own the railroad are wicked badhearted men who dont carehow much the poor people suffer so long as the road makes its eighteenmillion year
They dont care whether the people hate them or lovethem just so long as they are afraid of them
Its not right and Godwill punish them sooner or laterA little after this the two young men took themselves away Dykeobligingly carrying them in the wagon as far as the gate that openedinto the Quien Sabe ranch
On the way Presley referred to what MrsDyke had said and led Dyke himself to speak of the and WWell Dyke said its like this Mr Presley
personally haventgot the right to kick
With you wheatgrowing people guess itsdifferent but hops you see dont count for much in the State
Itssuch little business that the road dont want to bother themselves totax it
Its the wheat growers that the road cinches
The rates on hopsARE FAIR
Ive got to admit that was in to Bonneville while ago tofind out
Its two cents pound and Lord love you thats reasonableenough to suit any man
No he concluded Im on the way to make moneynow
The road sacking me as they did was maybe good thing for meafter all
It came just at the right time
had bit of money put byand here was the chance to go into hops with the certainty that hopswould quadruple and quintuple in price inside the year
No it was mychance and though they didnt mean it by long chalk the railroadpeople did me good turn when they gave me my timeand the tadllenter the seminary next fallAbout quarter of an hour after they had said goodbye to the onetimeengineer Presley and Vanamee tramping briskly along the road that lednorthward through Quien Sabe arrived at Annixters ranch house
At oncethey were aware of vast and unwonted bustle that revolved about theplace
They stopped few moments looking on amused and interested inwhat was going forward
The colossal barn was finished
Its freshly whitewashed sides glaredintolerably in the sun but its interior was as yet innocent of paintand through the yawning vent of the sliding doors came deliciousodour of new fresh wood and shavings
crowd of menAnnixters farmhandswere swarming all about it
Some were balanced on the topmostrounds of ladders hanging festoons of Japanese lanterns from treeto tree and all across the front of the barn itself
Mrs Tree herdaughter Hilma and another woman were inside the barn cutting into longstrips bolt after bolt of red white and blue cambric and directinghow these strips should be draped from the ceiling and on the wallseverywhere resounded the tapping of tack hammers
farm wagon droveup loaded to overflowing with evergreens and with great bundles ofpalm leaves and these were immediately seized upon and affixed assupplementary decorations to the tricoloured cambric upon the insidewalls of the barn
Two of the larger evergreen trees were placed oneither side the barn door and their tops bent over to form an arch
Inthe middle of this arch it was proposed to hang mammoth pasteboardescutcheon with gold letters spelling the word WELCOME
Piles ofchairs rented from IOOF
hall in Bonneville heaped themselves inan apparently hopeless entanglement on the ground while at the farextremity of the barn couple of carpenters clattered about theimpromptu staging which was to accommodate the band
There was strenuous gayety in the air everybody was in the best ofspirits
Notes of laughter continually interrupted the conversationon every hand
At every moment group of men involved themselves inuproarious horseplay
They passed oblique jokes behind their handsto each othergrossly veiled doublemeanings meant for the womenandbellowed with laughter thereat stamping on the ground
The relationsbetween the sexes grew more intimate the women and girls pushing theyoung fellows away from their sides with vigorous thrusts of theirelbows
It was passed from group to group that Adela Vacca divisionsuperintendents wife had lost her garter the daughter of the foremanof the Home ranch was kissed behind the door of the dairyhouse
Annixter in execrable temper appeared from time to time hatless hisstiff yellow hair in wild disorder
He hurried between the barn and theranch house carrying now wickered demijohn now case of wine nowa basket of lemons and pineapples
Besides general supervision he hadelected to assume the responsibility of composing the punchsomethingstiff by jingo punch that would raise you right out of your boots aregular hairlifter
The harness room of the barn he had set apart for himself andintimates
He had brought long table down from the house and uponit had set out boxes of cigars bottles of whiskey and of beer andthe great china bowls for the punch
It would be no fault of his hedeclared if half the number of his men friends were not uproariousbefore they left
His barn dance would be the talk of all Tulare Countyfor years to come
For this one day he had resolved to put all thoughtsof business out of his head
For the matter of that things were goingwell enough
Osterman was back from Los Angeles with favourablereport as to his affair with Disbrow and Darrell
There had been anothermeeting of the committee
Harran Derrick had attended
Though he hadtaken no part in the discussion Annixter was satisfied
The Governorhad consented to allow Harran to come in if he so desired andHarran had pledged himself to share onesixth of the campaign expensesproviding these did not exceed certain figure
As Annixter came to the door of the barn to shout abuse at thedistraught Chinese cook who was cutting up lemons in the kitchen hecaught sight of Presley and Vanamee and hailed them
Hello Pres he called
Come over here and see how she looks heindicated the barn with movement of his head
Well were gettingready for you tonight he went on as the two friends came up
Buthow we are going to get straightened out by eight oclock dont know
Would you believe that pip Caraher is short of lemonsat this lastminute and told him Id want three cases of em as much as monthago and here just when want good lively saddle horse to get aroundon somebody hikes the buckskin out the corral
STOLE her by jingo
Ill have the law on that thief if it breaks meand sixtydollarsaddle headstall gone with her and only about half the number ofJap lanterns that ordered have shown up and not candles enough forthose
Its enough to make dog sick
Theres nothing done that youdont do yourself unless you stand over these loafers with club
Imsick of the whole businessand Ive lost my hat wish to God Id neverdreamed of givin this rotten fool dance
Clutter the whole place upwith lot of feemales
sure did lose my presence of mind when gotTHAT ideaThen ignoring the fact that it was he himself who had called theyoung men to him he addedWell this is my busy day
Sorry cant stop and talk to you longerHe shouted last imprecation at the Chinaman and turned back into thebarn
Presley and Vanamee went on but Annixter as he crossed the floorof the barn all but collided with Hilma Tree who came out from one ofthe stalls box of candles in her arms
Gasping out an apology Annixter reentered the harness room closing thedoor behind him and forgetting all the responsibility of the momentlit cigar and sat down in one of the hired chairs his hands in hispockets his feet on the table frowning thoughtfully through the bluesmoke
Annixter was at last driven to confess to himself that he could not getthe thought of Hilma Tree out of his mind
Finally she had got holdon him The thing that of all others he most dreaded had happened
Afeemale girl had got hold on him and now there was no longer for himany such thing as peace of mind
The idea of the young woman was withhim continually
He went to bed with it he got up with it
At everymoment of the day he was pestered with it
It interfered with his workgot mixed up in his business
What miserable confession for man tomake fine way to waste his time
Was it possible that only the otherday he had stood in front of the music store in Bonneville and seriouslyconsidered making Hilma present of musicbox
Even now the verythought of it made him flush with shame and this after she had toldhim plainly that she did not like him
He was running after herheAnnixter
He ripped out furious oath striking the table with his bootheel
Again and again he had resolved to put the whole affair from outhis mind
Once he had been able to do so but of late it was becomingharder and harder with every successive day
He had only to close hiseyes to see her as plain as if she stood before him he saw her in aglory of sunlight that set fine tinted lustre of pale carnation andgold on the silken sheen of her white skin her hair sparkled with ither thick strong neck sloping to her shoulders with beautiful fullcurves seemed to radiate the light her eyes brown wide innocentin expression disclosing the full disc of the pupil upon the slightestprovocation flashed in this sunlight like diamonds
Annixter was all bewildered
With the exception of the timid littlecreature in the glovecleaning establishment in Sacramento he had hadno acquaintance with any woman
His world was harsh crude world ofmen onlymen who were to be combatted opposedhis hand was againstnearly every one of them
Women he distrusted with the instinctivedistrust of the overgrown schoolboy
Now at length young woman hadcome into his life
Promptly he was struck with discomfiture annoyedalmost beyond endurance harassed bedevilled excited made angry andexasperated
He was suspicious of the woman yet desired her totallyignorant of how to approach her hating the sex yet drawn to theindividual confusing the two emotions sometimes even hating Hilma asa result of this confusion but at all times disturbed vexed irritatedbeyond power of expression
At length Annixter cast his cigar from him and plunged again into thework of the day
The afternoon wore to evening to the accompanimentof wearying and clamorous endeavour
In some unexplained fashionthe labour of putting the great barn in readiness for the dance wasaccomplished the last bolt of cambric was hung in place from therafters
The last evergreen tree was nailed to the joists of thewalls the last lantern hung the last nail driven into the musiciansplatform
The sun set
There was great scurry to have supper anddress
Annixter last of all the other workers left the barn in thedusk of twilight
He was alone he had saw under one arm bag oftools was in his hand
He was in his shirt sleeves and carried his coatover his shoulder hammer was thrust into one of his hip pockets
Hewas in execrable temper
The days work had fagged him out
He had notbeen able to find his hat
And the buckskin with sixty dollars worth of saddle gone too hegroaned
Oh aint it sweetAt his house Mrs Tree had set out cold supper for him theinevitable dish of prunes serving as dessert
After supper Annixterbathed and dressed
He decided at the last moment to wear his usualtowngoing suit sack suit of black made by Bonneville tailor
Buthis hat was gone
There were other hats he might have worn but becausethis particular one was lost he fretted about it all through hisdressing and then decided to have one more look around the barn for it
For over quarter of an hour he pottered about the barn going fromstall to stall rummaging the harness room and feed room all to nopurpose
At last he came out again upon the main floor definitelygiving up the search looking about him to see if everything was inorder
The festoons of Japanese lanterns in and around the barn were not yetlighted but some halfdozen lamps with great tin reflectors thathung against the walls were burning low
dull half light pervaded thevast interior hollow echoing leaving the corners and roof thick withimpenetrable black shadows
The barn faced the west and through the opensliding doors was streaming single bright bar from the afterglowincongruous and out of all harmony with the dull flare of the kerosenelamps
As Annixter glanced about him he saw figure step briskly out of theshadows of one corner of the building pause for the fraction of oneinstant in the bar of light then at sight of him dart back again
There was sound of hurried footsteps
Annixter with recollections of the stolen buckskin in his mind criedout sharplyWhos thereThere was no answer
In second his pistol was in his hand
Whos there
Quick speak up or Ill shootNo no no dont shoot cried an answering voice
Oh be careful
Its IHilma TreeAnnixter slid the pistol into his pocket with great qualm ofapprehension
He came forward and met Hilma in the doorway
Good Lord he murmured that sure did give me start
If HADshotHilma stood abashed and confused before him
She was dressed in whiteorgandie frock of the most rigorous simplicity and wore neither flowernor ornament
The severity of her dress made her look even larger thanusual and even as it was her eyes were on level with Annixters
There was certain fascination in the contradiction of stature andcharacter of Hilmaa great girl halfchild as yet but tall as manfor all that
There was moments awkward silence then Hilma explainedII came back to look for my hat
thought left it here thisafternoonAnd was looking for my hat cried Annixter
Funny enough heyThey laughed at this as heartily as children might have done
Theconstraint of the situation was little relaxed and Annixter withsudden directness glanced sharply at the young woman and demandedWell Miss Hilma hate me as much as everOh no sir she answered never said hated youWelldislike me then know you said thatII disliked what you didTRIED to do
It made me angry and it hurtme
shouldnt have said what did that time but it was your faultYou mean you shouldnt have said you didnt like me asked Annixter
WhyWell wellI dontI dont DISlike anybody admitted Hilma
Then can take it that you dont dislike ME
Is that itI dont dislike anybody persisted Hilma
Well asked you more than that didnt queried Annixter uneasily
asked you to like me remember the other day
Im asking you thatagain now
want you to like meHilma lifted her eyes inquiringly to his
In her words was anunmistakable ring of absolute sincerity
Innocently she inquiredWhyAnnixter was struck speechless
In the face of such candour suchperfect ingenuousness he was at loss for any words
Wellwell he stammered wellI dont know he suddenly burst out
That is he went on groping for his wits cant quite say why The idea of colossal lie occurred to him thing actually royal
like to have the people who are around me like me he declared
II like to be popular understand
Yes thats it he continuedmore reassured
dont like the idea of any one disliking me
Thatsthe way am
Its my natureOh then returned Hilma you neednt bother
No dont dislikeyouWell thats good declared Annixter judicially
Thats good
Buthold on he interrupted Im forgetting
Its not enough to notdislike me
want you to like me
How about THATHilma paused for moment glancing vaguely out of the doorway towardthe lighted window of the dairyhouse her head tilted
dont know that ever thought about that she said
Well think about it now insisted Annixter
But never thought about liking anybody particularly she observed
Its because like everybody dont you seeWell youve got to like some people more than other people hazardedAnnixter and want to be one of those some people savvy
GoodLord dont know how to say these fool things
talk like galootwhen get talking to feemale girls and cant lay my tongue toanything that sounds right
It isnt my nature
And look here liedwhen said liked to have people like meto be popular
dontcare curse about peoples opinions of me
But theres fewpeople that are more to me than most othersthat chap Presley forinstanceand those people DO want to have like me
What they thinkcounts

How about this ranch
Dont know cant hear the men growlingoaths under their breath after Ive gone by
And in business ways too he went on speaking half to himself in Bonneville and all over thecounty theres not man of them wouldnt howl for joy if they got achance to down Buck Annixter

Let emgrind their teeth
They cant down me
When shut my fist theresnot one of them can open it

Well when mans hated as much as that it stands to reasondont it Miss Hilma that the few friends he has got he wants to keep
Im not such an entire swine to the people that know me bestthatjackass Presley for instance

Sometimes get kind of lonesome wonder if you wouldunderstand
Its my fault but theres not horse about the place thatdont lay his ears back when get on him theres not dog dont puthis tail between his legs as soon as come near him
The cayuse isntfoaled yet here on Quien Sabe that can throw me nor the dog whelpedthat would dare show his teeth at me

So it all comes tothis Id like to have youwell sort of feel that was good friendof yours and like me because of itThe flame in the lamp on the wall in front of Hilma stretched upwardtall and thin and began to smoke
She went over to where the lamp hungand standing on tiptoe lowered the wick
As she reached her handup Annixter noted how the sombre lurid red of the lamp made warmreflection on her smooth round arm
Do you understand he queried
Yes why yes she answered turning around
Its very good of you towant to be friend of mine
didnt think so though when you triedto kiss me
But maybe its all right since youve explained things
Yousee Im different from you

It makes one so much happier
You wouldnt believe itbut you ought to try it sir just to see

And everybody has always beenso good to me
Mamma and papa of course and Billy the stableman andMontalegre the Portugee foreman and the Chinese cook even and MrDelaneyonly he went awayand Mrs Vacca and her littleDelaney hey demanded Annixter abruptly
You and he were pretty goodfriends were youOh yes she answered
He was just as GOOD to me
Every day in thesummer time he used to ride over to the Seed ranch back of the Missionand bring me great armful of flowers the prettiest things and usedto pretend to pay him for them with dollars made of cheese that cutout of the cheese with biscuit cutter
It was such fun
We were thebest of friendsTheres another lamp smoking growled Annixter
Turn it down willyouand see that somebody sweeps this floor here
Its all littered upwith pine needles
Ive got lot to do
GoodbyeGoodbye sirAnnixter returned to the ranch house his teeth clenched enraged hisface flushed
Ah he muttered Delaney hey
Throwing it up to me that firedhim His teeth gripped together more fiercely than ever
The bestof friends hey
By God Ill have that girl yet
Ill show thatcowpuncher
Aint her employer her boss
Ill show herand Delaneytoo
It would be easy enoughand then Delaney can have herif he wantsherafter meAn evil light flashing from under his scowl spread over his face
Themale instincts of possession unreasoned treacherous oblique cametwisting to the surface
All the lower nature of the man ignorant ofwomen racked at one and the same time with enmity and desire rouseditself like hideous and abominable beast
And at the same momentHilma returned to her house humming to herself as she walked her whitedress glowing with shimmer of faint saffron light in the last ray ofthe afterglow
little after halfpast seven the first carryall bearing thedruggist of Bonneville and his womenfolk arrived in front of the newbarn
Immediately afterward an express wagon loaded down with aswarming family of SpanishMexicans gorgeous in red and yellow coloursfollowed
Billy the stableman and his assistant took charge of theteams unchecking the horses and hitching them to fence back of thebarn
Then Caraher the saloonkeeper in derby hat Prince Albert coat pointed yellow shoes and inevitable red necktie drove into theyard on his buckboard the delayed box of lemons under the seat
Itlooked as if the whole array of invited guests was to arrive in oneunbroken procession but for long halfhour nobody else appeared
Annixter and Caraher withdrew to the harness room and promptly involvedthemselves in wrangle as to the makeup of the famous punch
From timeto time their voices could be heard uplifted in clamorous argument
Two quarts and half and cupful of chartreuseRot rot know better
Champagne straight and dash of brandyThe druggists wife and sister retired to the feed room where bureauwith swinging mirror had been placed for the convenience of the women
The druggist stood awkwardly outside the door of the feed room his coatcollar turned up against the draughts that drifted through the barn hisface troubled debating anxiously as to the propriety of putting on hisgloves
The SpanishMexican family father mother and five childrenand sisterinlaw sat rigid on the edges of the hired chairs silentconstrained their eyes lowered their elbows in at their sidesglancing furtively from under their eyebrows at the decorations orwatching with intense absorption young Vacca son of one of the divisionsuperintendents who wore checked coat and white thread gloves andwho paced up and down the length of the barn frowning very importantwhittling wax candle over the floor to make it slippery for dancing
The musicians arrived the City Band of BonnevilleAnnixter havingmanaged to offend the leader of the Dirigo Club orchestra at the verylast moment to such point that he had refused his services
Thesemembers of the City Band repaired at once to their platform in thecorner
At every instant they laughed uproariously among themselvesjoshing one of their number Frenchman whom they called Skeezicks Their hilarity reverberated in hollow metallic roll among the raftersoverhead
The druggist observed to young Vacca as he passed by that hethought them pretty fresh just the same
Im busy Im very busy returned the young man continuing on hisway still frowning and paring the stump of candle
Two quarts half
Two quarts halfAh yes in way thats so and then again in way it ISNT
Iknow betterAll along one side of the barn were row of stalls fourteen of themclean as yet redolent of new cut wood the sawdust still in the cracksof the flooring
Deliberately the druggist went from one to the otherpausing contemplatively before each
He returned down the line and againtook up his position by the door of the feed room nodding his headjudicially as if satisfied
He decided to put on his gloves
By now it was quite dark
Outside between the barn and the ranch housesone could see group of men on stepladders lighting the festoons ofJapanese lanterns
In the darkness only their faces appeared here andthere high above the ground seen in haze of red strange grotesque
Gradually as the multitude of lanterns were lit the light spread
The grass underfoot looked like green excelsior
Another group of meninvaded the barn itself lighting the lamps and lanterns there
Soonthe whole place was gleaming with points of light
Young Vacca who haddisappeared returned with his pockets full of wax candles
He resumedhis whittling refusing to answer any questions vociferating that hewas busy
Outside there was sound of hoofs and voices
More guests had arrived
The druggist seized with confusion terrified lest he had put on hisgloves too soon thrust his hands into his pockets
It was CutterMagnus Derricks division superintendent who came bringing his wifeand her two girl cousins
They had come fifteen miles by the trail fromthe far distant division house on Four of Los Muertos and had riddenon horseback instead of driving
Mrs Cutter could be heard declaringthat she was nearly dead and felt more like going to bed than dancing
The two girl cousins in dresses of dotted Swiss over blue sateen weredoing their utmost to pacify her
She could be heard protesting frommoment to moment
One distinguished the phrases straight to my bed back nearly broken in two never wanted to come in the first place The druggist observing Cutter take pair of gloves from Mrs Cuttersreticule drew his hands from his pockets
But abruptly there was an interruption
In the musicians cornera scuffle broke out
chair was overturned
There was noise ofimprecations mingled with shouts of derision
Skeezicks the Frenchmanhad turned upon the joshers
Ah no he was heard to exclaim at the end of the end it is toomuch
Kind of bad canarywe will go to see about that
Aha let himclose up his face before demolish it with good stroke of the fistThe men who were lighting the lanterns were obliged to intervene beforehe could be placated
Hooven and his wife and daughters arrived
Minna was carrying littleHilda already asleep in her arms
Minna looked very pretty strikingeven with her black hair pale face very red lips and greenishblueeyes
She was dressed in what had been Mrs Hoovens wedding gown acheap affair of farmers satin Mrs Hooven had pendent earringsof imitation jet in her ears
Hooven was wearing an old frock coat ofMagnus Derricks the sleeves too long the shoulders absurdly too wide
He and Cutter at once entered into an excited conversation as to theownership of certain steer
Why the brandAch Gott der brendt Hooven clasped his head ach der brendt dotmaks me laugh some laughs
Dots gootder brendtdoand see umshoorder boole mit der bleck star bei der vorehead in der middle oaf
Anysomeones you esk tell you dot is mein boole

To hell mit der brendt
You aindt got some memorie aboudt doesting guess nodtPlease step aside gentlemen said young Vacca who was still makingthe rounds of the floor
Hooven whirled about
What den he exclaimed still excitedwilling to be angry at any one for the moment
Doand you push soh you
tink berhapz you doand OWN dose barn heyIm busy Im very busy The young man pushed by with gravepreoccupation
Two quarts half
Two quarts halfI know better
Thats all rotBut the barn was filling up rapidly
At every moment there was rattleof newly arrived vehicle from outside
Guest after guest appearedin the doorway singly or in couples or in families or in garrulousparties of five and six
Now it was Phelps and his mother from LosMuertos now foreman from Brodersons with his family now gaylyapparelled clerk from Bonneville store solitary and bewilderedlooking for place to put his hat now couple of SpanishMexicangirls from Guadalajara with coquettish effects of black and yellow abouttheir dress now group of Ostermans tenants Portuguese swarthywith plastered hair and curled mustaches redolent of cheap perfumes
Sarria arrived his smooth shiny face glistening with perspiration
Hewore new cassock and carried his broadbrimmed hat under his arm
Hisappearance made quite stir
He passed from group to group urbaneaffable shaking hands right and left he assumed set smile ofamiability which never left his face the whole evening
But abruptly there was veritable sensation
From out the little crowdthat persistently huddled about the doorway came Osterman
He worea dresssuit with white waistcoat and patent leather pumpswhata wonder
little qualm of excitement spread around the barn
Oneexchanged nudges of the elbow with ones neighbour whispering earnestlybehind the hand
What astonishing clothes
Catch on to the coattails
It was masquerade costume maybe that goat Osterman was such ajosher one never could tell what he would do next
The musicians began to tune up
From their corner came medley ofmellow sounds the subdued chirps of the violins the dull bourdon ofthe bass viol the liquid gurgling of the flageolet and the deeptonedsnarl of the big horn with now and then rasping stridulating of thesnare drum
sense of gayety began to spread throughout the assembly
At every moment the crowd increased
The aroma of newsawn timberand sawdust began to be mingled with the feminine odour of sachet andflowers
There was babel of talk in the airmale baritone and sopranochattervaried by an occasional note of laughter and the swish ofstiffly starched petticoats
On the row of chairs that went around threesides of the wall groups began to settle themselves
For long timethe guests huddled close to the doorway the lower end of the floorwas crowded
the upper end deserted but by degrees the lines of whitemuslin and pink and blue sateen extended dotted with the darker figuresof men in black suits
The conversation grew louder as the timidity ofthe early moments wore off
Groups at distance called back and forthconversations were carried on at top voice
Once even whole partyhurried across the floor from one side of the barn to the other
Annixter emerged from the harness room his face red with wrangling
Hetook position to the right of the door shaking hands with newcomersinviting them over and over again to cut loose and whoop it along
Intothe ears of his more intimate male acquaintances he dropped word asto punch and cigars in the harness room later on winking with vastintelligence
Ranchers from remoter parts of the country appearedGarnett from the Ruby rancho Keast from the ranch of the same nameGethings of the San Pablo Chattern of the Bonanza and others andstill others score of themelderly men for the most part beardedslow of speech deliberate dressed in broadcloth
Old Broderson whoentered with his wife on his arm fell in with this type and with themcame certain Dabney of whom nothing but his name was known silentold man who made no friends whom nobody knew or spoke to who was seenonly upon such occasions as this coming from no one knew where goingno one cared to inquire whither
Between eight and halfpast Magnus Derrick and his family were seen
Magnuss entry caused no little impression
Some said Theres theGovernor and called their companions attention to the thinerect figure commanding imposing dominating all in his immediateneighbourhood
Harran came with him wearing cutaway suit of black
He was undeniably handsome young and fresh looking his cheeks highlycoloured quite the finest looking of all the younger men blondstrong with that certain courtliness of manner that had always made himliked
He took his mother upon his arm and conducted her to seat bythe side of Mrs Broderson
Annie Derrick was very pretty that evening
She was dressed in greysilk gown with collar of pink velvet
Her light brown hair that yetretained so much of its brightness was transfixed by high shell combvery Spanish
But the look of uneasiness in her large eyesthe eyes ofa young girlwas deepening every day
The expression of innocenceand inquiry which they so easily assumed was disturbed by faintsuggestion of aversion almost of terror
She settled herself in herplace in the corner of the hall in the rear rank of chairs littlefrightened by the glare of lights the hum of talk and the shiftingcrowd glad to be out of the way to attract no attention willing toobliterate herself
All at once Annixter who had just shaken hands with Dyke his motherand the little tad moved abruptly in his place drawing in his breathsharply
The crowd around the great wideopen main door of the barn hadsomewhat thinned out and in the few groups that still remained there hehad suddenly recognised Mr and Mrs Tree and Hilma making their waytowards some empty seats near the entrance of the feed room
In the dusky light of the barn earlier in the evening Annixter had notbeen able to see Hilma plainly
Now however as she passed before hiseyes in the glittering radiance of the lamps and lanterns he caughthis breath in astonishment
Never had she appeared more beautiful in hiseyes
It did not seem possible that this was the same girl whom he sawevery day in and around the ranch house and dairy the girl of simplecalico frocks and plain shirt waists who brought him his dinner whomade up his bed
Now he could not take his eyes from her
Hilma forthe first time was wearing her hair done high upon her head
The thicksweetsmelling masses bitumen brown in the shadows corruscated likegolden filaments in the light
Her organdie frock was long longer thanany she had yet worn
It left little of her neck and breast bare andall of her arm
Annixter muttered an exclamation
Such arms
How did she manage tokeep them hid on ordinary occasions
Big at the shoulder tapering withdelicious modulations to the elbow and wrist overlaid with delicategleaming lustre
As often as she turned her head the movement senta slow undulation over her neck and shoulders the pale ambertintedshadows under her chin coming and going over the creamy whiteness ofthe skin like the changing moire of silk
The pretty rose colour ofher cheek had deepened to pale carnation
Annixter his hands claspedbehind him stood watching
In few moments Hilma was surrounded by group of young menclamouring for dances
They came from all corners of the barn leavingthe other girls precipitately almost rudely
There could be littledoubt as to who was to be the belle of the occasion
Hilmas littletriumph was immediate complete
Annixter could hear her voice from timeto time its usual velvety huskiness vibrating to note of exuberantgayety
All at once the orchestra swung off into marchthe Grand March
Therewas great rush to secure partners Young Vacca still going therounds was pushed to one side
The gayly apparelled clerk from theBonneville store lost his head in the confusion
He could not findhis partner He roamed wildly about the barn bewildered his eyesrolling
He resolved to prepare an elaborate programme card on theback of an old envelope
Rapidly the line was formed Hilma and HarranDerrick in the lead Annixter having obstinately refused to engagein either march set or dance the whole evening
Soon the confusedshuffling of feet settled to measured cadence the orchestra blaredand wailed the snare drum rolling at exact intervals the cornetmarking the time
It was halfpast eight oclock
Annixter drew long breathGood he muttered the thing is under way at lastSingularly enough Osterman also refused to dance
The week beforehe had returned from Los Angeles bursting with the importance of hismission
He had been successful
He had Disbrow in his pocket Hewas impatient to pose before the others of the committee as skilfulpolitical agent manipulator
He forgot his attitude of the early partof the evening when he had drawn attention to himself with his wonderfulclothes
Now his comic actors face with its brownishred cheeksprotuberant ears and horizontal slit of mouth was overcastwith gravity
His bald forehead was seamed with the wrinkles ofresponsibility
He drew Annixter into one of the empty stalls and beganan elaborate explanation glib voluble interminable going over againin detail what he had reported to the committee in outline
managedI schemedI kept darkI lay lowBut Annixter refused to listen
Oh rot your schemes
Theres punch in the harness room that willmake the hair grow on the top of your head in the place where the hairought to grow
Come on well round up some of the boys and walk intoitThey edged their way around the hall outside The Grand March towardthe harness room picking up on their way Caraher Dyke Hooven and oldBroderson
Once in the harness room Annixter shot the bolt
That affair outside he observed will take care of itself butheres little orphan child that gets lonesome without companyAnnixter began ladling the punch filling the glasses
Osterman proposed toast to Quien Sabe and the Biggest Barn
Theirelbows crooked in silence
Old Broderson set down his glass wiping hislong beard and remarkingThatthat certainly is veryvery agreeable
remember punch Idrank on Christmas day in or no it was anyhow that punchitwas in UkiahTWAS He wandered on aimlessly unable to stophis flow of speech losing himself in details involving his talk in ahopeless maze of trivialities to which nobody paid any attention
dont drink myself observed Dyke but just taste of that witha lot of water wouldnt be bad for the little tad
Shed think it waslemonade He was about to mix glass for Sidney but thought better ofit at the last moment
Its the chartreuse thats lacking commented Caraher lowering atAnnixter
The other flared up on the instant
Rot rot
know better
In some punches it goes and then again inothers it dontBut it was left to Hooven to launch the successful phraseGesundheit he exclaimed holding out his second glass
Afterdrinking he replaced it on the table with long breath
Ach Gott he cried dat poonsch say tink dot poonsch mek some demn gootvertilizer heyFertiliser
The others roared with laughter
Good eye Bismarck commented Annixter
The name had great success
Thereafter throughout the evening the punch was invariably spoken of asthe Fertiliser Osterman having spilt the bottom of glassful onthe floor pretended that he saw shoots of grain coming up on the spot
Suddenly he turned upon old Broderson
Im bald aint
Want to knowhow lost my hair
Promise you wont ask single other question andIll tell you
Promise your word of honourEh
WhatwhII dont understand
Your hair
Yes Ill promise
Howdid you lose itIt was bit offThe other gazed at him stupefied his jaw dropped
The company shoutedand old Broderson believing he had somehow accomplished witticismchuckled in his beard wagging his head
But suddenly he fell gravestruck with an idea
He demandedYesI knowbutbut what bit it offAh vociferated Osterman thats JUST what you promised not to askThe company doubled up with hilarity
Caraher leaned against the doorholding his sides but Hooven all abroad unable to follow gazed fromface to face with vacant grin thinking it was still question of hisfamous phrase
Vertilizer hey
Dots some fine joke hey
You bedtWhat with the noise of their talk and laughter it was some time beforeDyke first of all heard persistent knocking on the bolted door
Hecalled Annixters attention to the sound
Cursing the intruder Annixterunbolted and opened the door
But at once his manner changed
Its Presley
Come in come in PresThere was shout of welcome from the others
spirit of effusivecordiality had begun to dominate the gathering
Annixter caught sight ofVanamee back of Presley and waiving for the moment the distinction ofemployer and employee insisted that both the friends should come in
Any friend of Pres is my friend he declared
But when the two had entered and had exchanged greetings Presley drewAnnixter aside
Vanamee and have just come from Bonneville he explained
We sawDelaney there
Hes got the buckskin and hes full of bad whiskey anddagored
You should see him hes wearing all his cowpunching outfithair trousers sombrero spurs and all the rest of it and he hasstrapped himself to big revolver
He says he wasnt invited to yourbarn dance but that hes coming over to shoot up the place
He says youpromised to show him off Quien Sabe at the toe of your boot and thathes going to give you the chance tonight Ah commented Annixternodding his head he is is hePresley was disappointed
Knowing Annixters irascibility he hadexpected to produce more dramatic effect
He began to explain thedanger of the business
Delaney had once knifed greaser in thePanamint country
He was known as bad man
But Annixter refused tobe drawn
All right he said thats all right
Dont tell anybody else
Youmight scare the girls off
Get in and drinkOutside the dancing was by this time in full swing
The orchestrawas playing polka
Young Vacca now at his fiftieth wax candle hadbrought the floor to the slippery surface of glass
The druggist wasdancing with one of the SpanishMexican girls with the solemnity of anautomaton turning about and about always in the same direction hiseyes glassy his teeth set
Hilma Tree was dancing for the second timewith Harran Derrick
She danced with infinite grace
Her cheeks werebright red her eyes halfclosed and through her parted lips she drewfrom time to time long tremulous breath of pure delight
The musicthe weaving colours the heat of the air by now little oppressivethe monotony of repeated sensation even the pain of physical fatiguehad exalted all her senses
She was in dreamy lethargy of happiness
It was her first ball She could have danced without stopping untilmorning
Minna Hooven and Cutter were promenading Mrs Hooven withlittle Hilda already asleep on her knees never took her eyes fromher daughters gown
As often as Minna passed near her she vented anenergetic pst
pst The metal tip of white draw string was showingfrom underneath the waist of Minnas dress
Mrs Hooven was on the pointof tears
The solitary gayly apparelled clerk from Bonneville was in fever ofagitation
He had lost his elaborate programme card
Bewildered besidehimself with trepidation he hurried about the room jostled by thedancing couples tripping over the feet of those who were seatedhe peered distressfully under the chairs and about the floor askinganxious questions
Magnus Derrick the centre of listening circle of ranchersGarnettfrom the Ruby rancho Keast from the ranch of the same name Gethingsand Chattern of the San Pablo and Bonanzastood near the great opendoorway of the barn discussing the possibility of shortage in theworlds wheat crop for the next year
Abruptly the orchestra ceased playing with roll of the snare drum aflourish of the cornet and prolonged growl of the bass viol
Thedance broke up the couples hurrying to their seats leaving the gaylyapparelled clerk suddenly isolated in the middle of the floor rollinghis eyes
The druggist released the SpanishMexican girl with mechanicalprecision out amidst the crowd of dancers
He bowed dropping his chinupon his cravat throughout the dance neither had hazarded word
The girl found her way alone to chair but the druggist sick fromcontinually revolving in the same direction walked unsteadily towardthe wall
All at once the barn reeled around him he fell down
Therewas great laugh but he scrambled to his feet and disappeared abruptlyout into the night through the doorway of the barn deathly pale hishand upon his stomach
Dabney the old man whom nobody knew approached the group of ranchersaround Magnus Derrick and stood little removed listening gravelyto what the governor was saying his chin sunk in his collar silentoffering no opinions
But the leader of the orchestra with great gesture of his violin bowcried outAll take partners for the lancers and promenade around the hallHowever there was delay
little crowd formed around the musiciansplatform voices were raised there was commotion
Skeezicks whoplayed the big horn accused the cornet and the snaredrum of stealinghis cold lunch
At intervals he could be heard expostulatingAh no
at the end of the end
Render me the sausages you or less Ibreak your throat
know you
You are going to play me there abad farce
My sausages and the pork sandwich else go away from thisplaceHe made an exaggerated show of replacing his big horn in its case butthe bystanders raised great protest
The sandwiches and one sausagewere produced the other had disappeared
In the end Skeezichs allowedhimself to be appeased
The dance was resumed
Half an hour later the gathering in the harness room was considerablyreinforced
It was the corner of the barn toward which the male guestsnaturally gravitated
Harran Derrick who only cared to dance with HilmaTree was admitted
Garnett from the Ruby rancho and Gethings fromthe San Pablo came in little afterwards
fourth bowl of punch wasmixed Annixter and Caraher clamouring into each others face as to itsingredients
Cigars were lighted
Soon the air of the room became bluewith an acrid haze of smoke
It was very warm
Ranged in their chairsaround the side of the room the guests emptied glass after glass
Vanamee alone refused to drink
He sat little to one sidedisassociating himself from what was going forward watching the otherscalmly little contemptuously cigarette in his fingers
Hooven after drinking his third glass however was afflicted with agreat sadness his breast heaved with immense sighs
He asserted that hewas obbressed Cutter had taken his steer
He retired to corner andseated himself in heap on his chair his heels on the rungs wipingthe tears from his eyes refusing to be comforted
Old Brodersonstartled Annixter who sat next to him out of all measure by suddenlywinking at him with infinite craftiness
When was lad in Ukiah he whispered hoarsely was devil of afellow with the girls but Lordy he nudged him slyly wouldnt haveit knownOf those who were drinking Annixter alone retained all his wits
Thoughkeeping pace with the others glass for glass the punch left him solidupon his feet clearheaded
The tough crossgrained fibre of himseemed proof against alcohol
Never in his life had he been drunk
Heprided himself upon his power of resistance
It was his nature
Say exclaimed old Broderson gravely addressing the company pullingat his beard uneasilysay
Im devil of fellow withthe girls He wagged his head doggedly shutting his eyes in knowingfashion
Yes sir am
There was young lady in Ukiahthat waswhen was lad of seventeen
We used to meet in the cemetery in theafternoons
was to go away to school at Sacramento and the afternoonI left we met in the cemetery and we stayed so long almost missed thetrain
Her name was CelestineThere was pause
The others waited for the rest of the story
And afterwards prompted Annixter
Nothing afterwards
never saw her again
Her name wasCelestineThe company raised chorus of derision and Osterman cried ironicallySay
THATS pretty good one
Tell us anotherThe old man laughed with the rest believing he had made another hit
Hecalled Osterman to him whispering in his earSh
Look here
Some night you and will go up to San Franciscohey
Well go skylarking
Well be gay
Oh Im aaa rare old BUCK am
aint too old
Youll seeAnnixter gave over the making of the fifth bowl of punch to Ostermanwho affirmed that he had recipe for fertiliser from Solotarithat would take the plating off the ladle
He left him wrangling withCaraher who still persisted in adding chartreuse and stepped out intothe dance to see how things were getting on
It was the interval between two dances
In and around stall at thefarther end of the floor where lemonade was being served was greatthrong of young men
Others hurried across the floor singly or by twosand threes gingerly carrying overflowing glasses to their partners sitting in long rows of white and blue and pink against the oppositewall their mothers and older sisters in second darkclothed rankbehind them
babel of talk was in the air mingled with gusts oflaughter
Everybody seemed having good time
In the increasing heatthe decorations of evergreen trees and festoons threw off pungentaroma that suggested Sundayschool Christmas festival
In the otherstalls lower down the barn the young men had brought chairs and inthese deep recesses the most desperate lovemaking was in progress theyoung man his hair neatly parted leaning with great solicitation overthe girl his partner for the moment fanning her conscientiously hisarm carefully laid along the back of her chair
By the doorway Annixter met Sarria who had stepped out to smoke fatblack cigar
The set smile of amiability was still fixed on the priestssmooth shiny face the cigar ashes had left grey streaks on the frontof his cassock
He avoided Annixter fearing no doubt an allusionto his game cocks and took up his position back of the second rank ofchairs by the musicians stand beaming encouragingly upon every one whocaught his eye
Annixter was saluted right and left as he slowly went the round of thefloor
At every moment he had to pause to shake hands and to listen tocongratulations upon the size of his barn and the success of his dance
But he was distrait his thoughts elsewhere he did not attempt tohide his impatience when some of the young men tried to engage him inconversation asking him to be introduced to their sisters or theirfriends sisters
He sent them about their business harshly abominablyrude leaving wake of angry disturbance behind him sowing the seedsof future quarrels and renewed unpopularity
He was looking for HilmaTree
When at last he came unexpectedly upon her standing near where MrsTree was seated some halfdozen young men hovering uneasily in herneighbourhood all his audacity was suddenly stricken from him hisgruffness his overbearing insolence vanished with an abruptness thatleft him cold
His oldtime confusion and embarrassment returned to him
Instead of speaking to her as he intended he affected not to see herbut passed by his head in the air pretending sudden interest in aJapanese lantern that was about to catch fire
But he had had single distinct glimpse of her definite preciseand this glimpse was enough
Hilma had changed
The change wassubtle evanescent hard to define but not the less unmistakable
Theexcitement the enchanting delight the delicious disturbance of thefirst ball had produced its result
Perhaps there had only been thislacking
It was hard to say but for that brief instant of time Annixterwas looking at Hilma the woman
She was no longer the young girl uponwhom he might look down to whom he might condescend whose littleinfantile graces were to be considered with amused toleration
When Annixter returned to the harness room he let himself into aclamour of masculine hilarity
Osterman had indeed made marvellousfertiliser whiskey for the most part diluted with champagne andlemon juice
The first round of this drink had been welcomed witha salvo of cheers
Hooven recovering his spirits under its violentstimulation spoke of heving ut oudt mit Cudder bei Gott whileOsterman standing on chair at the end of the room shouted for afew moments quiet gentlemen so that he might tell certain storyhe knew
But abruptly Annixter discovered that the liquorsthechampagne whiskey brandy and the likewere running low
This wouldnever do
He felt that he would stand disgraced if it could besaid afterward that he had not provided sufficient drink at hisentertainment
He slipped out unobserved and finding two of his ranchhands near the doorway sent them down to the ranch house to bring upall the cases of stuff they found there
However when this matter had been attended to Annixter did notimmediately return to the harness room
On the floor of the barn asquare dance was under way the leader of the City Band calling thefigures
Young Vacca indefatigably continued the rounds of the barnparing candle after candle possessed with this single idea of dutypushing the dancers out of his way refusing to admit that the floor wasyet sufficiently slippery
The druggist had returned indoors and leaneddejected and melancholy against the wall near the doorway unable todance his evenings enjoyment spoiled
The gayly apparelled clerk fromBonneville had just involved himself in deplorable incident
In asearch for his handkerchief which he had lost while trying to find hisprogramme card he had inadvertently wandered into the feed room setapart as the ladies dressing room at the moment when Mrs Hoovenhaving removed the waist of Minnas dress was relacing her corsets
There was tremendous scene
The clerk was ejected forcibly MrsHooven filling all the neighbourhood with shrill expostulation
youngman Minnas partner who stood near the feed room door waiting forher to come out had invited the clerk with elaborate sarcasm to stepoutside for moment and the clerk breathless stupefied hustled fromhand to hand remained petrified with staring eyes turning about andabout looking wildly from face to face speechless witless wonderingwhat had happened
But the square dance was over
The City Band was just beginning to playa waltz
Annixter assuring himself that everything was going all rightwas picking his way across the floor when he came upon Hilma Tree quitealone and looking anxiously among the crowd of dancers
Having good time Miss Hilma he demanded pausing for moment
Oh am JUST she exclaimed
The best timebut dont know whathas become of my partner
Im left all alonethe only time thiswhole evening she added proudly
Have you seen himmy partner sir
forget his name
only met him this evening and Ive met SO manyI cant begin to remember half of them
He was young man fromBonnevillea clerk think because remember seeing him in storethere and he wore the prettiest clothesI guess he got lost in the shuffle observed Annixter
Suddenly anidea occurred to him
He took his resolution in both hands
He clenchedhis teeth
look here Miss Hilma
Whats the matter with you and stealingthis one for ourselves
dont mean to dance
dont propose to makea jumpingjack of myself for some galoot to give me the laugh but wellwalk around
Will you
What do you sayHilma consented
Im not so VERY sorry missed my dance with thatthatlittle clerk she said guiltily
suppose thats very bad of me isnt itAnnixter fulminated vigorous protest
AM so warm murmured Hilma fanning herself with her handkerchiefand oh
SUCH good time as have had
was so afraid that wouldbe wallflower and sit up by mamma and papa the whole evening andas it is have had every single dance and even some dances had tosplit
Ohh she breathed glancing lovingly around the barn notingagain the festoons of tricoloured cambric the Japanese lanternsflaring lamps and decorations of evergreen ohh
its all solovely just like fairy story and to think that it cant last but forone little evening and that tomorrow morning one must wake up to theeveryday things againWell observed Annixter doggedly unwilling that she should forgetwhom she ought to thank did my best and my best is as good asanother mans guessHilma overwhelmed him with burst of gratitude which he grufflypretended to deprecate
Oh that was all right
It hadnt cost him much
He liked to see people having good time himself and the crowd didseem to be enjoying themselves
What did SHE think
Did things looklively enough
And how about herselfwas she enjoying it
Stupidly Annixter drove the question home again at his wits end as tohow to make conversation
Hilma protested volubly she would never forgetthis night addingDance
Oh you dont know how love it
didnt know myself
coulddance all night and never stop onceAnnixter was smitten with uneasiness
No doubt this promenading wasnot at all to her taste
Wondering what kind of spectacle he was aboutto make of himself he exclaimedWant to dance nowOh yes she returned
They paused in their walk and Hilma facing him gave herself intohis arms
Annixter shut his teeth the perspiration starting from hisforehead
For five years he had abandoned dancing
Never in his bestdays had it been one of his accomplishments
They hesitated moment waiting to catch the time from the musicians
Another couple bore down upon them at precisely the wrong momentjostling them out of step
Annixter swore under his breath
His armstill about the young woman he pulled her over to one corner
Now he muttered well try againA second time listening to the onetwothree onetwothree cadence ofthe musicians they endeavoured to get under way
Annixter waited thefraction of second too long and stepped on Hilmas foot
On the thirdattempt having worked out of the corner pair of dancers bumped intothem once more and as they were recovering themselves another couplecaromed violently against Annixter so that he all but lost his footing
He was in rage
Hilma very embarrassed was trying not to laugh andthus they found themselves out in the middle of the floor continuallyjostled from their position holding clumsily to each other stammeringexcuses into one anothers faces when Delaney arrived
He came with the suddenness of an explosion
There was commotion bythe doorway rolling burst of oaths furious stamping of hoofs awild scramble of the dancers to either side of the room and there hewas
He had ridden the buckskin at gallop straight through the doorwayand out into the middle of the floor of the barn
Once well inside Delaney hauled up on the cruel spadebit at the sametime driving home the spurs and the buckskin without halting in hergait rose into the air upon her hind feet and coming down again with athunder of iron hoofs upon the hollow floor lashed out with both heelssimultaneously her back arched her head between her knees
It was therunning buck and had not Delaney been the hardest buster in the countywould have flung him headlong like sack of sand
But he eased off thebit gripping the mares flanks with his knees and the buckskin havinglong since known her master came to hand quivering the bloody spumedripping from the bit upon the slippery floor
Delaney had arrayed himself with painful elaboration determined tolook the part bent upon creating the impression resolved that hisappearance at least should justify his reputation of being bad Nothing was lackingneither the campaign hat with upturned brim northe dotted blue handkerchief knotted behind the neck nor the heavygauntlets stitched with red northis above allthe bearskinchaparejos the hair trousers of the mountain cowboy the pistolholster low on the thigh
But for the moment this holster was emptyand in his right hand the hammer at full cock the chamber loadedthe puncher flourished his teaser an army Colts the lamplight dullyreflected in the dark blue steel
In second of time the dance was bedlam
The musicians stopped with adiscord and the middle of the crowded floor bared itself instantly
Itwas like sand blown from off rock the throng of guests carried by animpulse that was not to be resisted bore back against the sides ofthe barn overturning chairs tripping upon each other falling downscrambling to their feet again stepping over one another gettingbehind each other diving under chairs flattening themselves againstthe walla wild clamouring pellmell blind deaf panicstrickena confused tangle of waving arms torn muslin crushed flowers palefaces tangled legs that swept in all directions back from the centreof the floor leaving Annixter and Hilma alone deserted their armsabout each other face to face with Delaney mad with alcohol burstingwith remembered insult bent on evil reckless of results
After the first scramble for safety the crowd fell quiet for thefraction of an instant glued to the walls afraid to stir struck dumband motionless with surprise and terror and in the instants silencethat followed Annixter his eyes on Delaney muttered rapidly to HilmaGet back get away to one side
The fool MIGHT shootThere was seconds respite afforded while Delaney occupied himselfin quieting the buckskin and in that second of time at this moment ofcrisis the wonderful thing occurred
Hilma turning from Delaney herhands clasped on Annixters arm her eyes meeting his exclaimedYou tooAnd that was all but to Annixter it was revelation
Never more aliveto his surroundings never more observant he suddenly understood
Forthe briefest lapse of time he and Hilma looked deep into each otherseyes and from that moment on Annixter knew that Hilma cared
The whole matter was brief as the snapping of finger
Two words anda glance and all was done
But as though nothing had occurred Annixterpushed Hilma from him repeating harshlyGet back tell you
Dont you see hes got gun
Havent enough onmy hands without youHe loosed her clasp and his eyes once more on Delaney moved diagonallybackwards toward the side of the barn pushing Hilma from him
Inthe end he thrust her away so sharply that she gave back with longstagger somebody caught her arm and drew her in leaving Annixter aloneonce more in the middle of the floor his hands in his coat pocketswatchful alert facing his enemy
But the cowpuncher was not ready to come to grapples yet
Fearlesshis wits gambolling under the lash of the alcohol he wished to make themost of the occasion maintaining the suspense playing for the gallery
By touches of the hand and knee he kept the buckskin in continualnervous movement her hoofs clattering snorting tossing her headwhile he himself addressing himself to Annixter poured out torrentof invective
Well strike me blind if it aint old Buck Annixter
He was going toshow me off Quien Sabe at the toe of his boot was he
Well heresyour chancewith the ladies to see you do it
Gives dance doeshe highfalutin hoedown in his barn and forgets to invite his oldbronchobustin friend
But his friend dont forget him no he dont
He remembers little things does his bronchobustin friend
Likes tosee dance hisself on occasion his friend does
Comes anyhow trustinhis welcome will be hearty just to see old Buck Annixter dance just toshow Buck Annixters friends how Buck can dancedance all by hisself alittle henonahotplate dance when his bronchobustin friend askshim so polite
little dance for the ladies Buck
This feature ofthe entertainment is alone worth the price of admission
Tune up Buck
Attention now
Ill give you the keyHe fanned his revolver spinning it about his index finger by thetriggerguard with incredible swiftness the twirling weapon mere blurof blue steel in his hand
Suddenly and without any apparent cessationof the movement he fired and little splinter of wood flipped intothe air at Annixters feet
Time he shouted while the buckskin reared to the report
Holdonwait minute
This place is too light to suit
That big lightyonder is in my eyes
Look out Im going to throw leadA second shot put out the lamp over the musicians stand
The assembledguests shrieked frantic shrinking quiver ran through the crowd likethe huddling of frightened rabbits in their pen
Annixter hardly moved
He stood some thirty paces from the busterhis hands still in his coat pockets his eyes glistening watchful
Excitable and turbulent in trifling matters when actual bodily dangerthreatened he was of an abnormal quiet
Im watching you cried the other
Dont make any mistake about that
Keep your hands in your COAT pockets if youd like to live littlelonger understand
And dont let me see you make move toward your hipor your friends will be asked to identify you at the morgue tomorrowmorning
When Im bad Im called the Undertakers Friend so am andIm that bad tonight that Im scared of myself
Theyll have to revisethe census returns before Im done with this place
Come on now Imgetting tired waiting
come to see danceHand over that horse Delaney said Annixter without raising hisvoice and clear outThe other affected to be overwhelmed with infinite astonishment hiseyes staring
He peered down from the saddle
Whaat he exclaimed whaat did you say
Why guess you mustbe looking for trouble thats what guessTheres where youre wrong mson muttered Annixter partly toDelaney partly to himself
If was looking for trouble there wouldntbe any guesswork about itWith the words he began firing
Delaney had hardly entered the barnbefore Annixters plan had been formed
Long since his revolver wasin the pocket of his coat and he fired now through the coat itselfwithout withdrawing his hands
Until that moment Annixter had not been sure of himself
There wasno doubt that for the first few moments of the affair he wouldhave welcomed with joy any reasonable excuse for getting out of thesituation
But the sound of his own revolver gave him confidence
Hewhipped it from his pocket and fired again
Abruptly the duel began report following report spurts of pale bluesmoke jetting like the darts of short spears between the two menexpanding to haze and drifting overhead in wavering strata
It wasquite probable that no thought of killing each other suggested itself toeither Annixter or Delaney
Both fired without aiming very deliberately
To empty their revolvers and avoid being hit was the desire common toboth
They no longer vituperated each other
The revolvers spoke forthem
Long after Annixter could recall this moment
For years he couldwith but little effort reconstruct the scenethe densely packed crowdflattened against the sides of the barn the festoons of lanterns themingled smell of evergreens new wood sachets and powder smokethe vague clamour of distress and terror that rose from the throng ofguests the squealing of the buckskin the uneven explosions of therevolvers the reverberation of trampling hoofs brief glimpse ofHarran Derricks excited face at the door of the harness room andin the open space in the centre of the floor himself and Delaneymanoeuvring swiftly in cloud of smoke
Annixters revolver contained but six cartridges
Already it seemed tohim as if he had fired twenty times
Without doubt the next shot washis last
Then what
He peered through the blue haze that with everydischarge thickened between him and the buster
For his own safetyhe must place at least one shot
Delaneys chest and shoulders rosesuddenly above the smoke close upon him as the distraught buckskinreared again
Annixter for the first time during the fight tookdefinite aim but before he could draw the trigger there was greatshout and he was aware of the buckskin the bridle trailing the saddleempty plunging headlong across the floor crashing into the line ofchairs
Delaney was scrambling off the floor
There was blood on thebusters wrist and he no longer carried his revolver
Suddenly he turnedand ran
The crowd parted right and left before him as he made towardthe doorway
He disappeared
Twenty men promptly sprang to the buckskins head but she broke awayand wild with terror bewildered blind insensate charged into thecorner of the barn by the musicians stand
She brought up against thewall with cruel force and with impact of sack of stones her head wascut
She turned and charged again bulllike the blood streaming fromher forehead
The crowd shrieking melted before her rush
An oldman was thrown down and trampled
The buckskin trod upon the draggingbridle somersaulted into confusion of chairs in one corner and camedown with terrific clatter in wild disorder of kicking hoofs andsplintered wood
But crowd of men fell upon her tugging at the bitsitting on her head shouting gesticulating
For five minutes shestruggled and fought then by degrees she recovered herself drawinggreat sobbing breaths at long intervals that all but burst the girthsrolling her eyes in bewildered supplicating fashion trembling in everymuscle and starting and shrinking now and then like young girl inhysterics
At last she lay quiet
The men allowed her to struggle to herfeet
The saddle was removed and she was led to one of the empty stallswhere she remained the rest of the evening her head low her pasternsquivering turning her head apprehensively from time to time showingthe white of one eye and at long intervals heaving single prolongedsigh
And an hour later the dance was progressing as evenly as though nothingin the least extraordinary had occurred
The incident was closedthatabrupt swoop of terror and impending death dropping down there from outthe darkness cutting abruptly athwart the gayety of the moment comeand gone with the swiftness of thunderclap
Many of the women had gonehome taking their men with them but the great bulk of the crowd stillremained seeing no reason why the episode should interfere with theevenings enjoyment resolved to hold the ground for mere bravado iffor nothing else
Delaney would not come back of that everybody waspersuaded and in case he should there was not found wanting fully halfa hundred young men who would give him dressing down by jingo
Theyhad been too surprised to act when Delaney had first appeared andbefore they knew where they were at the buster had cleared out
Inanother minute just another second they would have shown himyessir by jingoah you bet
On all sides the reminiscences began to circulate
At least one man inevery three had been involved in gun fight at some time of his life
Ah you ought to have seen in Yuba County one time Why in ButteCounty in the early days Pshaw
this tonight wasnt anything
Whyonce in saloon in Arizona when was there and so on over and overagain
Osterman solemnly asserted that he had seen greaser sawn in twoin Nevada sawmill
Old Broderson had witnessed Vigilante lynching in on California Street in San Francisco
Dyke recalled how once in hisengineering days he had run over drunk at street crossing
Gethingsof the San Pablo had taken shot at highwayman
Hooven had bayonetteda French Chasseur at Sedan
An old SpanishMexican centenarian fromGuadalajara remembered Fremonts stand on mountain top in San BenitoCounty
The druggist had fired at burglar trying to break intohis store one New Years eve
Young Vacca had seen dog shot inGuadalajara
Father Sarria had more than once administered thesacraments to Portuguese desperadoes dying of gunshot wounds
Even thewomen recalled terrible scenes
Mrs Cutter recounted to an interestedgroup how she had seen claim jumped in Placer County in whenthree men were shot falling in fusillade of rifle shots and expiringlater upon the floor of her kitchen while she looked on
Mrs Dykehad been in stage holdup when the shotgun messenger was murdered
Stories by the hundreds went the round of the company
The air wassurcharged with blood dying groans the reek of powder smoke the crackof rifles
All the legends of the violent wild life of the earlydays were recalled to view defiling before them there in an endlessprocession under the glare of paper lanterns and kerosene lamps
But the affair had aroused combative spirit amongst the men of theassembly
Instantly spirit of aggression of truculence swelled upunderneath waistcoats and starched shirt bosoms
More than one offenderwas promptly asked to step outside It was like young bucks excitedby an encounter of stags lowering their horns upon the slightestprovocation showing off before the does and fawns
Old quarrels wereremembered
One sought laboriously for slights and insults veiled inordinary conversation
The sense of personal honour became refined toa delicate fine point
Upon the slightest pretext there was haughtydrawing up of the figure twisting of the lips into smile of scorn
Caraher spoke of shooting Behrman on sight before the end of theweek
Twice it became necessary to separate Hooven and Cutter renewingtheir quarrel as to the ownership of the steer
All at once MinnaHoovens partner fell upon the gayly apparelled clerk fromBonneville pummelling him with his fists hustling him out of the hallvociferating that Miss Hooven had been grossly insulted
It took threemen to extricate the clerk from his clutches dazed gasping his collarunfastened and sticking up into his face his eyes staring wildly intothe faces of the crowd
But Annixter bursting with pride his chest thrown out his chin inthe air reigned enthroned in circle of adulation
He was the Hero
Toshake him by the hand was an honour to be struggled for
One clappedhim on the back with solemn nods of approval
Theres the BOY for you There was nerve for you Whats the matter with Annixter How aboutTHAT for sand and how was THAT for SHOT Why Apache Kid couldnthave bettered that Cool enough Took steady eye and sure handto make shot like that There was shot that would be told about inTulare County fifty years to comeAnnixter had refrained from replying all ears to this conversationwondering just what had happened
He knew only that Delaney had runleaving his revolver and spatter of blood behind him
By degreeshowever he ascertained that his last shot but one had struck Delaneyspistol hand shattering it and knocking the revolver from his grip
Hewas overwhelmed with astonishment
Why after the shooting began hehad not so much as seen Delaney with any degree of plainness
The wholeaffair was whirl
Well where did YOU learn to shoot THAT way some one in the crowddemanded
Annixter moved his shoulders with gesture of vast unconcern
Oh he observed carelessly its not my SHOOTING that ever worriedME msonThe crowd gaped with delight
There was great wagging of heads
Well guess notNo sir not muchAh no you bet notWhen the women pressed around him shaking his hands declaring thathe had saved their daughters lives Annixter assumed pose of superbdeprecation the modest selfobliteration of the chevalier
He deliveredhimself of remembered phrase very elegant refined
It was Lancelotafter the tournament Bayard receiving felicitations after the battle
Oh dont say anything about it he murmured
only did what any manwould have done in my placeTo restore completely the equanimity of the company he announcedsupper
This he had calculated as tremendous surprise
It was to havebeen served at midnight but the irruption of Delaney had dislocatedthe order of events and the tables were brought in an hour ahead oftime
They were arranged around three sides of the barn and were loadeddown with cold roasts of beef cold chickens and cold ducks mountainsof sandwiches pitchers of milk and lemonade entire cheeses bowlsof olives plates of oranges and nuts
The advent of this supper wasreceived with volley of applause
The musicians played quick step
The company threw themselves upon the food with great scraping ofchairs and vast rustle of muslins tarletans and organdies soonthe clatter of dishes was veritable uproar
The tables were taken byassault
One ate whatever was nearest at hand some even beginning withoranges and nuts and ending with beef and chicken
At the end the papercaps were brought on together with the ice cream
All up and down thetables the pulled crackers snapped continually like the discharge ofinnumerable tiny rifles
The caps of tissue paper were put onPhrygian Bonnets MagiciansCaps Liberty Caps the young girls looked across the table at theirvisavis with bursts of laughter and vigorous clapping of the hands
The harness room crowd had table to themselves at the head of whichsat Annixter and at the foot Harran
The gun fight had soberedPresley thoroughly
He sat by the side of Vanamee who ate but littlepreferring rather to watch the scene with calm observation littlecontemptuous when the uproar around the table was too boisteroussavouring of intoxication
Osterman rolled bullets of bread and shotthem with astonishing force up and down the table but the othersDykeold Broderson Caraher Harran Derrick Hooven Cutter Garnett of theRuby rancho Keast from the ranch of the same name Gethings of the SanPablo and Chattern of the Bonanzaoccupied themselves with eating asmuch as they could before the supper gave out
At corner of the tablespeechless unobserved ignored sat Dabney of whom nothing was knownbut his name the silent old man who made no friends
He ate and drankquietly dipping his sandwich in his lemonade
Osterman ate all the olives he could lay his hands on score of themfifty of them hundred of them
He touched no crumb of anything else
Old Broderson stared at him his jaw fallen
Osterman declared he hadonce eaten thousand on bet
The men called each others attention tohim
Delighted to create sensation Osterman persevered
The contentsof an entire bowl disappeared in his huge reptilian slit of mouth
His cheeks of brownish red were extended his bald forehead glistened
Colics seized upon him
His stomach revolted
It was all one with him
He was satisfied contented
He was astonishing the people
Once swallowed tree toad he told old Broderson by mistake
was eating grapes and the beggar lived in me three weeks
In rainyweather he would sing
You dont believe that he vociferated
HaventI got the toad at home now in bottle of alcoholAnd the old man never doubting his eyes starting wagged his head inamazement
Oh yes cried Caraher the length of the table thats pretty goodone
Tell us anotherThat reminds me of story hazarded old Broderson uncertainly oncewhen was lad in Ukiah fifty yearsOh yes cried half dozen voices THATS pretty good one
Tell usanotherEhwhwhat murmured Broderson looking about him
II dont know
It was Ukiah
Youyouyou mix me all upAs soon as supper was over the floor was cleared again
The guestsclamoured for Virginia reel
The last quarter of the evening the timeof the most riotous fun was beginning
The young men caught thegirls who sat next to them
The orchestra dashed off into rollickingmovement
The two lines were formed
In second of time the dancewas under way again the guests still wearing the Phrygian bonnets andliberty caps of pink and blue tissue paper
But the group of men once more adjourned to the harness room
Freshboxes of cigars were opened the seventh bowl of fertiliser was mixed
Osterman poured the dregs of glass of it upon his bald head declaringthat he could feel the hair beginning to grow
But suddenly old Broderson rose to his feet
Aha he cackled IM going to have dance am
Think Im tooold
Ill show you young fellows
Im regular old ROOSTER when getstartedHe marched out into the barn the others following holding their sides
He found an aged Mexican woman by the door and hustled her all confusedand giggling into the Virginia reel then at its height
Every onecrowded around to see
Old Broderson stepped off with the alacrity of acolt snapping his fingers slapping his thigh his mouth widening inan excited grin
The entire company of the guests shouted
The City Bandredoubled their efforts and the old man losing his head breathlessgasping dislocated his stiff joints in his efforts
He becamepossessed bowing scraping advancing retreating wagging his beardcutting pigeons wings distraught with the music the clamour theapplause the effects of the fertiliser
Annixter shoutedNice eye Santa ClausBut Annixters attention wandered
He searched for Hilma Tree havingstill in mind the look in her eyes at that swift moment of danger
Hehad not seen her since then
At last he caught sight of her
She was notdancing but instead was sitting with her partner at the end of thebarn near her father and mother her eyes wide serious expression onher face her thoughts no doubt elsewhere
Annixter was about to go toher when he was interrupted by cry
Old Broderson in the midst of double shuffle had clapped his handto his side with gasp which he followed by whoop of anguish
Hehad got stitch or had started twinge somewhere
With gestureof resignation he drew himself laboriously out of the dance limpingabominably one leg dragging
He was heard asking for his wife
Old MrsBroderson took him in charge
She jawed him for making an exhibition ofhimself scolding as though he were tenyearold
Well want to know she exclaimed as he hobbled off dejected andmelancholy leaning upon her arm thought he had to dance indeed
gay old grandpa this
Hed better be thinking of his coffinIt was almost midnight
The dance drew towards its close in stormof jubilation
The perspiring musicians toiled like galley slaves theguests singing as they danced
The group of men reassembled in the harness room
Even Magnus Derrickcondescended to enter and drink toast
Presley and Vanamee stillholding themselves aloof looked on Vanamee more and more disgusted
Dabney standing to one side overlooked and forgotten continued tosip steadily at his glass solemn reserved
Garnett of the Ruby ranchoKeast from the ranch of the same name Gethings of the San Pablo andChattern of the Bonanza leaned back in their chairs their waistcoatsunbuttoned their legs spread wide laughingthey could not tell why
Other ranchers men whom Annixter had never seen appeared in the roomwheat growers from places as far distant as Goshen and Pixley young menand old proprietors of veritable principalities hundreds of thousandsof acres of wheat lands dozen of them score of them men who werestrangers to each other but who made it point to shake hands withMagnus Derrick the prominent man of the valley
Old Broderson whomevery one had believed had gone home returned though much sobered andtook his place refusing however to drink another spoonful
Soon the entire number of Annixters guests found themselves in twocompanies the dancers on the floor of the barn frolicking through thelast figures of the Virginia reel and the boisterous gathering of men inthe harness room downing the last quarts of fertiliser
Both assemblieshad been increased
Even the older people had joined in the dance whilenearly every one of the men who did not dance had found their way intothe harness room
The two groups rivalled each other in their noise
Outon the floor of the barn was very whirlwind of gayety tempest oflaughter handclapping and cries of amusement
In the harness roomthe confused shouting and singing the stamping of heavy feet set aquivering reverberation in the oil of the kerosene lamps the flame ofthe candles in the Japanese lanterns flaring and swaying in the gustsof hilarity
At intervals between the two one heard the music thewailing of the violins the vigorous snarling of the cornet and theharsh incessant rasping of the snare drum
And at times all these various sounds mingled in single vaguenote huge clamorous that rose up into the night from the colossalreverberating compass of the barn and sent its echoes far off across theunbroken levels of the surrounding ranches stretching out to infinityunder the clouded sky calm mysterious still
Annixter the punch bowl clasped in his arms was pouring out the lastspoonful of liquor into Carahers glass when he was aware that some onewas pulling at the sleeve of his coat
He set down the punch bowl
Well where did YOU come from he demanded
It was messenger from Bonneville the uniformed boy that the telephonecompany employed to carry messages
He had just arrived from town on hisbicycle out of breath and panting
Message for you sir
Will you signHe held the book to Annixter who signed the receipt wondering
The boy departed leaving thick envelope of yellow paper in Annixtershands the address typewritten the word Urgent written in blue pencilin one corner
Annixter tore it open
The envelope contained other sealed envelopessome eight or ten of them addressed to Magnus Derrick OstermanBroderson Garnett Keast Gethings Chattern Dabney and to Annixterhimself
Still puzzled Annixter distributed the envelopes muttering to himselfWhats up nowThe incident had attracted attention
comparative quiet followed theguests following the letters with their eyes as they were passed aroundthe table
They fancied that Annixter had arranged surprise
Magnus Derrick who sat next to Annixter was the first to receive hisletter
With word of excuse he opened it
Read it read it Governor shouted halfdozen voices
No secretsyou know
Everything above board here tonightMagnus cast glance at the contents of the letter then rose to hisfeet and read Magnus Derrick Bonneville Tulare Co Cal
Dear Sir By regrade of October st the value of the railroad land you occupy included in your ranch of Los Muertos has been fixed at per acre
The land is now for sale at that price to any one
Yours etc CYRUS BLAKELEE RUGGLES Land Agent and BEHRMAN Local Agent and RIn the midst of the profound silence that followed Osterman was heardto exclaim grimlyTHATS pretty good one
Tell us anotherBut for long moment this was the only remark
The silence widened broken only by the sound of torn paper as AnnixterOsterman old Broderson Garnett Keast Gethings Chattern and Dabneyopened and read their letters
They were all to the same effect almostword for word like the Governors
Only the figures and the proper namesvaried
In some cases the price per acre was twentytwo dollars
InAnnixters case it was thirty
Andand the company promised to sell to me toto all of us gaspedold Broderson at TWO DOLLARS AND HALF an acreIt was not alone the ranchers immediately around Bonneville who wouldbe plundered by this move on the part of the Railroad
The alternatesection system applied throughout all the San Joaquin
By striking atthe Bonneville ranchers terrible precedent was established
Ofthe crowd of guests in the harness room alone nearly every man wasaffected every man menaced with ruin
All of million acres wassuddenly involved
Then suddenly the tempest burst
dozen men were on their feet in aninstant their teeth set their fists clenched their faces purple withrage
Oaths curses maledictions exploded like the firing of successivemines
Voices quivered with wrath hands flung upward the fingershooked prehensile trembled with anger
The sense of wrongs theinjustices the oppression extortion and pillage of twenty yearssuddenly culminated and found voice in raucous howl of execration
For second there was nothing articulate in that cry of savageexasperation nothing even intelligent
It was the human animal houndedto its corner exploited harried to its last stand at bay ferociousterrible turning at last with bared teeth and upraised claws to meetthe death grapple
It was the hideous squealing of the tormented bruteits back to the wall defending its lair its mate and its whelps readyto bite to rend to trample to batter out the life of The Enemy in aprimeval bestial welter of blood and fury
The roar subsided to intermittent clamour in the pauses of which thesounds of music and dancing made themselves audible once more
Behrman again vociferated Harran Derrick
Chose his moment well muttered Annixter
Hits his hardest when wereall rounded up having good timeGentlemen this is ruinWhats to be done nowFIGHT
My God
do you think we are going to stand this
Do you think weCANThe uproar swelled again
The clearer the assembly of ranchersunderstood the significance of this move on the part of the Railroadthe more terrible it appeared the more flagrant the more intolerable
Was it possible was it within the bounds of imagination that thistyranny should be contemplated
But they knewpast years had drivenhome the lessonthe implacable iron monster with whom they had todeal and again and again the sense of outrage and oppression lashedthem to their feet their mouths wide with curses their fists clenchedtight their throats hoarse with shouting
How fight
What ARE you going to doIf theres law in this landIf there is it is in Shelgrims pocket
Who owns the courts inCalifornia
Aint it ShelgrimGod damn himWell how long are you going to stand it
How long before youll settleup accounts with six inches of plugged gaspipeAnd our contracts the solemn pledges of the corporation to sell to usfirst of allAnd now the land is for sale to anybodyWhy it is question of my home

ByGod gentlemen law or no law railroad or no railroad IWILLNOTNor INor INor IThis is the last
Legal means first if those failthe shotgunThey can kill me
They can shoot me down but Ill diedie fightingfor my homebefore Ill give in to thisAt length Annixter made himself heardAll out of the room but the ranch owners he shouted
HoovenCaraher Dyke youll have to clear out
This is family affair
Presley you and your friend can remainReluctantly the others filed through the door
There remained in theharness roombesides Vanamee and PresleyMagnus Derrick Annixter oldBroderson Harran Garnett from the Ruby rancho Keast from the ranch ofthe same name Gethings of the San Pablo Chattern of the Bonanza abouta score of others ranchers from various parts of the county and lastof all Dabney ignored silent to whom nobody spoke and who as yethad not uttered word
But the men who had been asked to leave theharness room spread the news throughout the barn
It was repeated fromlip to lip
One by one the guests dropped out of the dance
Groups wereformed
By swift degrees the gayety lapsed away
The Virginia reelbroke up
The musicians ceased playing and in the place of the noisyeffervescent revelry of the previous half hour subdued murmur filledall the barn mingling of whispers lowered voices the coming andgoing of light footsteps the uneasy shifting of positions while frombehind the closed doors of the harness room came prolonged sullenhum of anger and strenuous debate
The dance came to an abrupt end
The guests unwilling to go as yet stunned distressed stood clumsilyabout their eyes vague their hands swinging at their sides lookingstupidly into each others faces
sense of impending calamityoppressive foreboding gloomy passed through the air overhead in thenight long shiver of anguish and of terror mysterious despairing
In the harness room however the excitement continued unchecked
Onerancher after another delivered himself of torrent of furious words
There was no order merely the frenzied outcry of blind fury
One spiritalone was common to allresistance at whatever cost and to whateverlengths
Suddenly Osterman leaped to his feet his bald head gleaming in thelamplight his red ears distended flood of words filling his greathorizontal slit of mouth his comic actors face flaming
Like thehero of melodrama he took stage with great sweeping gesture
ORGANISATION he shouted that must be our watchword
The curseof the ranchers is that they fritter away their strength
Now we muststand together now NOW
Heres the crisis heres the moment
Shall wemeet it
CALL FOR THE LEAGUE
Not next week not tomorrow not in themorning but now now now this very moment before we go out of thatdoor
Every one of us here to join it to form the beginnings of vastorganisation banded together to death if needs be for the protectionof our rights and homes
Are you ready
Is it now or never
call forthe LeagueInstantly there was shout
With an actors instinct Osterman hadspoken at the precise psychological moment
He carried the others offtheir feet glib dexterous voluble
Just what was meant by the Leaguethe others did not know but it was something vague engine machinewith which to fight
Osterman had not done speaking before the room rangwith outcries the crowd of men shouting for what they did not know
The League
The LeagueNow tonight this moment sign our names before we leaveHes right
The LeagueWe have committee at work already Osterman vociferated

What our aims are we will explain to you later
Let this committeebe the nucleus of the Leaguetemporarily at least
Trust us
We areworking for you and with you
Let this committee be merged into thelarger committee of the League and for President of the Leaguehepaused the fraction of secondfor President there can be but onename mentioned one man to whom we all must look as leaderMagnusDerrickThe Governors name was received with storm of cheers
The harnessroom reechoed with shouts ofDerrick
DerrickMagnus for PresidentDerrick our natural leaderDerrick Derrick Derrick for PresidentMagnus rose to his feet
He made no gesture
Erect as cavalry officertall thin commanding he dominated the crowd in an instant
There wasa moments hush
Gentlemen he said if organisation is good wordmoderation is better one
The matter is too grave for haste
wouldsuggest that we each and severally return to our respective homes forthe night sleep over what has happened and convene again tomorrowwhen we are calmer and can approach this affair in more judiciousmood
As for the honour with which you would inform me must affirmthat that too is matter for grave deliberation
This League is buta name as yet
To accept control of an organisation whose principles arenot yet fixed is heavy responsibility
shrink from itBut he was allowed to proceed no farther
storm of protest developed
There were shouts ofNo no
The League tonight and Derrick for PresidentWe have been moderate too longThe League first principles afterwardWe cant wait declared Osterman
Many of us cannot attend meetingtomorrow
Our business affairs would prevent it
Now we are alltogether
propose temporary chairman and secretary be named anda ballot be taken
But first the League
Let us draw up set ofresolutions to stand together for the defence of our homes to deathif needs be and each man present affix his signature theretoHe subsided amidst vigorous applause
The next quarter of an hour wasa vague confusion every one talking at once conversations going onin low tones in various corners of the room
Ink pens and sheaf offoolscap were brought from the ranch house
set of resolutions wasdraughted having the force of pledge organising the League ofDefence
Annixter was the first to sign
Others followed only fewholding back refusing to join till they had thought the matter over
The roll grew the paper circulated about the table each signature waswelcomed by salvo of cheers
At length it reached Harran Derrick whosigned amid tremendous uproar
He released the pen only to shake scoreof hands
Now Magnus DerrickGentlemen began the Governor once more rising beg of you toallow me further consideration
GentlemenHe was interrupted by renewed shouting
No no now or never
Sign join the LeagueDont leave us
We look to you to helpBut presently the excited throng that turned their faces towards theGovernor were aware of new face at his elbow
The door of the harnessroom had been left unbolted and Mrs Derrick unable to endure theheartbreaking suspense of waiting outside had gathered up all hercourage and had come into the room
Trembling she clung to Magnussarm her pretty lightbrown hair in disarray her large young girlseyes wide with terror and distrust
What was about to happen she did notunderstand but these men were clamouring for Magnus to pledge himselfto something to some terrible course of action some ruthlessunscrupulous battle to the death with the ironhearted monster ofsteel and steam
Nerved with cowards intrepidity she who so easilyobliterated herself had found her way into the midst of this franticcrowd into this hot close room reeking of alcohol and tobacco smokeinto this atmosphere surcharged with hatred and curses
She seized herhusbands arm imploring distraught with terror
No no she murmured no dont signShe was the feather caught in the whirlwind
En masse the crowd surgedtoward the erect figure of the Governor the pen in one hand his wifesfingers in the other the roll of signatures before him
The clamourwas deafening the excitement culminated brusquely
Half hundredhands stretched toward him thirty voices at top pitch imploredexpostulated urged almost commanded
The reverberation of the shoutingwas as the plunge of cataract
It was the uprising of The People the thunder of the outbreak ofrevolt the mob demanding to be led aroused at last imperiousresistless overwhelming
It was the blind fury of insurrection thebrute manytongued redeyed bellowing for guidance baring its teethunsheathing its claws imposing its will with the abrupt resistlesspressure of the relaxed piston inexorable knowing no pity
No no implored Annie Derrick
No Magnus dont signHe must declared Harran shouting in her ear to make himself heardhe must
Dont you understandAgain the crowd surged forward roaring
Mrs Derrick was swept backpushed to one side
Her husband no longer belonged to her
She paid thepenalty for being the wife of great man
The world like colossaliron wedge crushed itself between
She was thrust to the wall
Thethrong of men stamping surrounded Magnus she could no longer see himbut terrorstruck she listened
There was moments lull then vastthunder of savage jubilation
Magnus had signed
Harran found his mother leaning against the wall her hands shut overher ears her eyes dilated with fear brimming with tears
He led herfrom the harness room to the outer room where Mrs Tree and Hilma tookcharge of her and then impatient refusing to answer the hundreds ofanxious questions that assailed him hurried back to the harness room
Already the balloting was in progress Osterman acting as temporarychairman on the very first ballot he was made secretary of the Leaguepro tem and Magnus unanimously chosen for its President
An executivecommittee was formed which was to meet the next day at the Los Muertosranch house
It was halfpast one oclock
In the barn outside the greater number ofthe guests had departed
Long since the musicians had disappeared
Thereonly remained the families of the ranch owners involved in the meetingin the harness room
These huddled in isolated groups in corners of thegarish echoing barn the women in their wraps the young men withtheir coat collars turned up against the draughts that once more madethemselves felt
For long half hour the loud hum of eager conversation continued toissue from behind the door of the harness room
Then at length therewas prolonged scraping of chairs
The session was over
The men cameout in groups searching for their families
At once the homeward movement began
Every one was worn out
Some of theranchers daughters had gone to sleep against their mothers shoulders
Billy the stableman and his assistant were awakened and the teamswere hitched up
The stable yard was full of maze of swinging lanternsand buggy lamps
The horses fretted champing the bits the carryallscreaked with the straining of leather and springs as they received theirloads
At every instant one heard the rattle of wheels as vehicle aftervehicle disappeared in the night
fine drizzling rain was falling and the lamps began to show dim in avague haze of orange light
Magnus Derrick was the last to go
At the doorway of the barn he foundAnnixter the roll of nameswhich it had been decided he was to keepin his safe for the momentunder his arm
Silently the two shook hands
Magnus departed
The grind of the wheels of his carryall grated sharplyon the gravel of the driveway in front of the ranch house then witha hollow roll across little plank bridge gained the roadway
For amoment the beat of the horses hoofs made itself heard on the roadway
It ceased
Suddenly there was great silence
Annixter in the doorway of the great barn stood looking about himfor moment alone thoughtful
The barn was empty
That astonishingevening had come to an end
The whirl of things and people the crowdof dancers Delaney the gun fight Hilma Tree her eyes fixed on himin mute confession the rabble in the harness room the news of theregrade the fierce outburst of wrath the hasty organising of theLeague all went spinning confusedly through his recollection
But hewas exhausted
Time enough in the morning to think it all over
By nowit was raining sharply
He put the roll of names into his inside pocketthrew sack over his head and shoulders and went down to the ranchhouse
But in the harness room lighted by the glittering lanterns and flaringlamps in the midst of overturned chairs spilled liquor cigar stumpsand broken glasses Vanamee and Presley still remained talking talking
At length they rose and came out upon the floor of the barn and stoodfor moment looking about them
Billy the stableman was going the rounds of the walls putting outlight after light
By degrees the vast interior was growing dim
Uponthe roof overhead the rain drummed incessantly the eaves dripping
The floor was littered with pine needles bits of orange peel ends andfragments of torn organdies and muslins and bits of tissue paper fromthe Phrygian Bonnets and Liberty Caps The buckskin mare in thestall dozing on three legs changed position with long sigh
Thesweat stiffening the hair upon her back and loins as it dried gave offa penetrating ammoniacal odour that mingled with the stale perfume ofsachet and wilted flowers
Presley and Vanamee stood looking at the deserted barn
There was longsilence
Then Presley saidWell what do you think of it allI think answered Vanamee slowly think that there was dance inBrussels the night before WaterlooBOOK IICHAPTER IIn his office at San Francisco seated before massive desk of polishedredwood very ornate Lyman Derrick sat dictating letters to histypewriter on certain morning early in the spring of the year
The subdued monotone of his voice proceeded evenly from sentence tosentence regular precise businesslike
have the honour to acknowledge herewith your favour of the thinstant and in reply would statePlease find enclosed draft upon New Orleans to be applied as per ourunderstandingIn answer to your favour No
referring to the case of the Cityand County of San Francisco against Excelsior Warehouse Storage Co Iwould sayHis voice continued expressionless measured distinct
While he spokehe swung slowly back and forth in his leather swivel chair his elbowsresting on the arms his pop eyes fixed vaguely upon the calendar onthe opposite wall winking at intervals when he paused searching for aword
Thats all for the present he said at length
Without reply the typewriter rose and withdrew thrusting her pencilinto the coil of her hair closing the door behind her softlydiscreetly
When she had gone Lyman rose stretching himself putting up threefingers to hide his yawn
To further loosen his muscles he took acouple of turns the length of he room noting with satisfaction its fineappointments the padded red carpet the dull olive green tint of thewalls the few choice engravingsportraits of Marshall Taney Fieldand coloured lithographexcellently doneof the Grand Canyon of theColoradothe deepseated leather chairs the large and crowded bookcasetopped with bust of James Lick and huge greenish globe the wastebasket of woven coloured grass made by Navajo Indians the massivesilver inkstand on the desk the elaborate filing cabinet complete inevery particular and the shelves of tin boxes padlocked impressivegrave bearing the names of clients cases and estates
He was between thirtyone and thirtyfive years of age
Unlike Harranhe resembled his mother but he was much darker than Annie Derrickand his eyes were much fuller the eyeball protruding giving him apopeyed foreign expression quite unusual and unexpected
His hair wasblack and he wore small tight pointed mustache which he was in thehabit of pushing delicately upward from the corners of his lips with theball of his thumb the little finger extended
As often as he made thisgesture he prefaced it with little twisting gesture of the forearm inorder to bring his cuff into view and in fact this movement by itselfwas habitual
He was dressed carefully his trousers creased pink rose in hislapel
His shoes were of patent leather his cutaway coat was of veryrough black cheviot his doublebreasted waistcoat of tan covered clothwith buttons of smoked pearl
An Ascot scarfa great puff of heavyblack silkwas at his neck the knot transfixed by tiny golden pinset off with an opal and four small diamonds
At one end of the room were two great windows of plate glass andpausing at length before one of these Lyman selected cigarette fromhis curved box of oxydized silver lit it and stood looking down andout willing to be idle for moment amused and interested in the view
His office was on the tenth floor of the EXCHANGE BUILDING beautifultowerlike affair of white stone that stood on the corner of MarketStreet near its intersection with Kearney the most imposing officebuilding of the city
Below him the city swarmed tumultuous through its grooves thecablecars starting and stopping with gay jangling of bells and astrident whirring of jostled glass windows
Drays and carts clatteredover the cobbles and an incessant shuffling of thousands of feet rosefrom the pavement
Around Lottas fountain the baskets of the flowersellers crammed with chrysanthemums violets pinks roses lilieshyacinths set brisk note of colour in the grey of the street
But to Lymans notion the general impression of this centre of thecitys life was not one of strenuous business activity
It was acontinuous interest in small things people ever willing to be amusedat trifles refusing to consider serious mattersgoodnaturedallowing themselves to be imposed upon taking life easilygenerouscompanionable enthusiastic living as it were from day to day in aplace where the luxuries of life were had without effort in city thatoffered to consideration the restlessness of New York without itsearnestness the serenity of Naples without its languor the romanceof Seville without its picturesqueness
As Lyman turned from the window about to resume his work the officeboy appeared at the door
The man from the lithograph company sir announced the boy
Well what does he want demanded Lyman adding however upon theinstant Show him inA young man entered carrying great bundle which he deposited on achair with gasp of relief exclaiming all out of breathFrom the Standard Lithograph CompanyWhat isDont know replied the other
Maps guessI dont want any maps
Who sent them
guess youre mistaken Lymantore the cover from the top of the package drawing out one of greatmany huge sheets of white paper folded eight times
Suddenly heuttered an exclamationAh see
They ARE maps
But these should not have come here
They areto go to the regular office for distribution He wrote new directionon the label of the package Take them to that address he went on
Ill keep this one here
The others go to that address
If you see MrDarrell tell him that Mr Derrickyou get the nameMr Derrick maynot be able to get around this afternoon but to go ahead with anybusiness just the sameThe young man departed with the package and Lyman spreading out the mapupon the table remained for some time studying it thoughtfully
It was commissioners official railway map of the State of Californiacompleted to March th of that year
Upon it the different railwaysof the State were accurately plotted in various colours blue greenyellow
However the blue the yellow and the green were but brieftraceries very short isolated unimportant
At little distancethese could hardly be seen
The whole map was gridironed by vastcomplicated network of red lines marked and Thesecentralised at San Francisco and thence ramified and spread north eastand south to every quarter of the State
From Coles in the topmostcorner of the map to Yuma in the lowest from Reno on one side to SanFrancisco on the other ran the plexus of red veritable system ofblood circulation complicated dividing and reuniting branchingsplitting extending throwing out feelers offshoots tap rootsfeedersdiminutive little blood suckers that shot out from the mainjugular and went twisting up into some remote county laying holdupon some forgotten village or town involving it in one of myriadbranching coils one of hundred tentacles drawing it as it weretoward that centre from which all this system sprang
The map was white and it seemed as if all the colour which should havegone to vivify the various counties towns and cities marked uponit had been absorbed by that huge sprawling organism with its ruddyarteries converging to central point
It was as though the State hadbeen sucked white and colourless and against this pallid background thered arteries of the monster stood out swollen with lifeblood reachingout to infinity gorged to bursting an excrescence gigantic parasitefattening upon the lifeblood of an entire commonwealth
However in an upper corner of the map appeared the names of the threenew commissioners Jones McNish for the first district Lyman Derrickfor the second and James Darrell for the third
Nominated in the Democratic State convention in the fall of thepreceding year Lyman backed by the coteries of San Francisco bossesin the pay of his fathers political committee of ranchers had beenelected together with Darrell the candidate of the Pueblo and Mojaveroad and McNish the avowed candidate of the Pacific and Southwestern
Darrell was rabidly against the and McNish rabidly for it
Lyman was supposed to be the conservative member of the board theranchers candidate it was true and faithful to their interests buta calm man deliberative swayed by no such violent emotions as hiscolleagues
Ostermans dexterity had at last succeeded in entangling Magnusinextricably in the new politics
The famous League organised inthe heat of passion the night of Annixters barn dance had beenconsolidated all through the winter months
Its executive committee ofwhich Magnus was chairman had been through Ostermans manipulationmerged into the old committee composed of Broderson Annixter andhimself
Promptly thereat he had resigned the chairmanship of thiscommittee thus leaving Magnus at its head
Precisely as Osterman hadplanned Magnus was now one of them
The new committee accordingly hadtwo objects in view to resist the attempted grabbing of their lands bythe Railroad and to push forward their own secret scheme of electing aboard of railroad commissioners who should regulate wheat rates so asto favour the ranchers of the San Joaquin
The land cases were promptlytaken to the courts and the new gradingfixing the price of the landsat twenty and thirty dollars an acre instead of twobitterly andstubbornly fought
But delays occurred the process of the law wasinterminable and in the intervals the committee addressed itself to thework of seating the Ranchers Commission as the projected Board ofCommissioners came to be called
It was Harran who first suggested that his brother Lyman be putforward as the candidate for this district
At once the proposition hada great success
Lyman seemed made for the place
While allied by everytie of blood to the ranching interests he had never been identifiedwith them
He was citybred
The Railroad would not be oversuspiciousof him
He was good lawyer good business man keen clearheadedfarsighted had already some practical knowledge of politics havingserved term as assistant district attorney and even at the presentmoment occupying the position of sheriffs attorney
More than all hewas the son of Magnus Derrick he could be relied upon could be trustedimplicitly to remain loyal to the ranchers cause
The campaign for Railroad Commissioner had been very interesting
Atthe very outset Magnuss committee found itself involved in corruptpolitics
The primaries had to be captured at all costs and by anymeans and when the convention assembled it was found necessary to buyoutright the votes of certain delegates
The campaign fund raised bycontributions from Magnus Annixter Broderson and Osterman was drawnupon to the extent of five thousand dollars
Only the committee knew of this corruption
The League ignoringways and means supposed as matter of course that the campaign washonorably conducted
For whole week after the consummation of this part of the deal Magnushad kept to his house refusing to be seen alleging that he wasill which was not far from the truth
The shame of the business theloathing of what he had done were to him things unspeakable
He couldno longer look Harran in the face
He began course of deceptionwith his wife
More than once he had resolved to break with the wholeaffair resigning his position allowing the others to proceed withouthim
But now it was too late
He was pledged
He had joined the League
He was its chief and his defection might mean its disintegration at thevery time when it needed all its strength to fight the land cases
Morethan mere deal in bad politics was involved
There was the land grab
His withdrawal from an unholy cause would mean the weakening perhapsthe collapse of another cause that he believed to be righteous as truthitself
He was hopelessly caught in the mesh
Wrong seemed indissolublyknitted into the texture of Right
He was blinded dizzied overwhelmedcaught in the current of events and hurried along he knew not where
Heresigned himself
In the end and after much ostentatious opposition on the part of therailroad heelers Lyman was nominated and subsequently elected
When this consummation was reached Magnus Osterman Broderson andAnnixter stared at each other
Their wildest hopes had not dared to fixthemselves upon so easy victory as this
It was not believable thatthe corporation would allow itself to be fooled so easily would rushopeneyed into the trap
How had it happened
Osterman however threw his hat into the air with wild whoops ofdelight
Old Broderson permitted himself feeble cheer
Even Magnusbeamed satisfaction
The other members of the League present at thetime shook hands all around and spoke of opening few bottles on thestrength of the occasion
Annixter alone was recalcitrant
Its too easy he declared
No Im not satisfied
Wheres Shelgrimin all this
Why dont he show his hand damn his soul
The thing isyellow tell you
Theres big fish in these waters somewheres
Idont know his name and dont know his game but hes moving roundoff and on just out of sight
If you think youve netted him DONTthats all Ive got to sayBut he was jeered down as croaker
There was the Commission
Hecouldnt get around that could he
There was Darrell and Lyman Derrickboth pledged to the ranches
Good Lord he was never satisfied
Hed beobstinate till the very last gun was fired
Why if he got drowned in ariver hed float upstream just to be contrary
In the course of time the new board was seated
For the first fewmonths of its term it was occupied in clearing up the business leftover by the old board and in the completion of the railway map
Butnow the decks were cleared
It was about to address itself to theconsideration of revision of the tariff for the carriage of grainbetween the San Joaquin Valley and tidewater
Both Lyman and Darrell were pledged to an average ten per cent
cut ofthe grain rates throughout the entire State
The typewriter returned with the letters for Lyman to sign and he putaway the map and took up his mornings routine of business wonderingthe while what would become of his practice during the time he wasinvolved in the business of the Ranchers Railroad Commission
But towards noon at the moment when Lyman was drawing off glass ofmineral water from the siphon that stood at his elbow there was aninterruption
Some one rapped vigorously upon the door which wasimmediately after opened and Magnus and Harran came in followed byPresley
Hello hello cried Lyman jumping up extending his hands whyheres surprise
didnt expect you all till tonight
Come in comein and sit down
Have glass of sizzwater GovernorThe others explained that they had come up from Bonneville the nightbefore as the Executive Committee of the League had received despatchfrom the lawyers it had retained to fight the Railroad that the judgeof the court in San Francisco where the test cases were being triedmight be expected to hand down his decision the next day
Very soon after the announcement of the new grading of the rancherslands the corporation had offered through Behrman to lease thedisputed lands to the ranchers at nominal figure
The offer had beenangrily rejected and the Railroad had put up the lands for sale atRuggless office in Bonneville
At the exorbitant price named buyerspromptly appeareddummy buyers beyond shadow of doubt acting eitherfor the Railroad or for Behrmanmen hitherto unknown in the countymen without property without money adventurers heelers
Prominentamong them and bidding for the railroads holdings included onAnnixters ranch was Delaney
The farce of deeding the corporations sections to these fictitiouspurchasers was solemnly gone through with at Ruggless office theRailroad guaranteeing them possession
The League refused to allow thesupposed buyers to come upon the land and the Railroad faithful toits pledge in the matter of guaranteeing its dummies possession at oncebegan suits in ejectment in the district court in Visalia the countyseat
It was the preliminary skirmish the reconnaisance in force thecombatants feeling each others strength willing to proceed withcaution postponing the actual deathgrip for while till each hadstrengthened its position and organised its forces
During the time the cases were on trial at Visalia Behrman was muchin evidence in and about the courts
The trial itself after tediouspreliminaries was brief
The ranchers lost
The test cases wereimmediately carried up to the United States Circuit Court in SanFrancisco
At the moment the decision of this court was pending
Why this is news exclaimed Lyman in response to the Governorsannouncement did not expect them to be so prompt
was in courtonly last week and there seemed to be no end of business ahead
Isuppose you are very anxiousMagnus nodded
He had seated himself in one of Lymans deep chairs hisgrey tophat with its wide brim on the floor beside him
His coat ofblack broadcloth that had been tightly packed in his valise was yetwrinkled and creased his trousers were strapped under his high boots
As he spoke he stroked the bridge of his hawklike nose with his bentforefinger
Leaningback in his chair he watched his two sons with secret delight
To his eye both were perfect specimens of their class intelligentwelllooking resourceful
He was intensely proud of them
He was neverhappier never more nearly jovial never more erect more military morealert and buoyant than when in the company of his two sons
He honestlybelieved that no finer examples of young manhood existed throughout theentire nation
think we should win in this court Harran observed watching thebubbles break in his glass
The investigation has been much morecomplete than in the Visalia trial
Our case this time is too good
Ithas made too much talk
The court would not dare render decision forthe Railroad
Why theres the agreement in black and whiteand thecirculars the Railroad issued
How CAN one get around thoseWell well we shall know in few hours now remarked Magnus
Oh exclaimed Lyman surprised it is for this morning then
Whyarent you at the courtIt seemed undignified boy answered the Governor
We shall know soonenoughGood God exclaimed Harran abruptly when think of what isinvolved
Why Lyman its our home the ranch house itself nearly allLos Muertos practically our whole fortune and just now when there ispromise of an enormous crop of wheat
And it is not only us
There areover half million acres of the San Joaquin involved
In some cases ofthe smaller ranches it is the confiscation of the whole of theranchers land
If this thing goes through it will absolutely beggarnearly hundred men
Broderson wouldnt have thousand acres to hisname
Why its monstrousBut the corporations offered to lease these lands remarked Lyman
Are any of the ranchers taking up that offeror are any of them buyingoutrightBuying
At the new figure exclaimed Harran at twenty and thirty anacre
Why theres not one in ten that CAN
They are landpoor
And asfor leasingleasing land they virtually ownno theres precious feware doing that thank God
That would be acknowledging the railroadsownership right awayforfeiting their rights for good
None of theLEAGUERS are doing it know
That would be the rankest treacheryHe paused for moment drinking the rest of the mineral water theninterrupting Lyman who was about to speak to Presley drawing him intothe conversation through politeness said Matters are just rompingright along to crisis these days
Its make or break for the wheatgrowers of the State now no mistake
Here are the land cases and thenew grain tariff drawing to head at about the same time
If we win ourland cases theres your new freight rates to be applied and then allis beer and skittles
Wont the San Joaquin go wild if we pull it offand believe we willHow we wheat growers are exploited and trapped and deceived atevery turn observed Magnus sadly
The courts the capitalists therailroads each of them in turn hoodwinks us into some new and wonderfulscheme only to betray us in the end
Well he added turning to Lymanone thing at least we can depend on
We will cut their grain rates forthem eh LymanLyman crossed his legs and settled himself in his office chair
have wanted to have talk with you about that sir he said
Yeswe will cut the ratesan average per cent
cut throughout theState as we are pledged
But am going to warn you Governor and youHarran dont expect too much at first
The man who even after twentyyears training in the operation of railroads can draw an equitablesmoothly working schedule of freight rates between shipping point andcommon point is capable of governing the United States
What with mainlines and leased lines and points of transfer and the laws governingcommon carriers and the rulings of the InterState Commerce Commissionthe whole matter has become so confused that Vanderbilt himself couldntstraighten it out
And how can it be expected that railroad commissionswho are chosenwell lets be frankas ours was for instance fromout number of men who dont know the difference between switchingcharge and differential rate are going to regulate the whole businessin six months time
Cut rates yes any fool can do that any fool canwrite one dollar instead of two but if you cut too low by fraction ofone per cent
and if the railroad can get out an injunction tie youup and show that your new rate prevents the road being operated at aprofit how are you any better offYour conscientiousness does you credit Lyman said the Governor
Irespect you for it my son
know you will be fair to the railroad
That is all we want
Fairness to the corporation is fairness to thefarmer and we wont expect you to readjust the whole matter out ofhand
Take your time
We can afford to waitAnd suppose the next commission is railroad board and reverses allour figuresThe onetime mining king the most redoubtable poker player of CalaverasCounty permitted himself momentary twinkle of his eyes
By then it will be too late
We will all of us have made our fortunesby thenThe remark left Presley astonished out of all measure He never couldaccustom himself to these strange lapses in the Governors character
Magnus was by nature public man judicious deliberate standing firmfor principle yet upon rare occasion by some such remark as this hewould betray the presence of subnature of recklessness inconsistentall at variance with his creeds and tenets
At the very bottom when all was said and done Magnus remained theFortyniner
Deep down in his heart the spirit of the Adventurer yetpersisted
We will all of us have made fortunes by then That was itprecisely
After us the deluge For all his public spirit for all hischampionship of justice and truth his respect for law Magnus remainedthe gambler willing to play for colossal stakes to hazard fortune onthe chance of winning million
It was the true California spiritthat found expression through him the spirit of the West unwilling tooccupy itself with details refusing to wait to be patient to achieveby legitimate plodding the miners instinct of wealth acquired in asingle night prevailed in spite of all
It was in this frame of mindthat Magnus and the multitude of other ranchers of whom he was typefarmed their ranches
They had no love for their land
They were notattached to the soil
They worked their ranches as quarter of acentury before they had worked their mines
To husband the resources oftheir marvellous San Joaquin they considered niggardly petty Hebraic
To get all there was out of the land to squeeze it dry to exhaust itseemed their policy
When at last the land worn out would refuse toyield they would invest their money in something else by then theywould all have made fortunes
They did not care
After us the delugeLyman however was obviously uneasy willing to change the subject
Herose to his feet pulling down his cuffs
By the way he observed want you three to lunch with me todayat my club
It is close by
You can wait there for news of the courtsdecision as well as anywhere else and should like to show you theplace
have just joinedAt the club when the four men were seated at small table in the roundwindow of the main room Lymans popularity with all classes was veryapparent
Hardly man entered that did not call out salutation tohim some even coming over to shake his hand
He seemed to be everymans friend and to all he seemed equally genial
His affability evento those whom he disliked was unfailing
See that fellow yonder he said to Magnus indicating certainmiddleaged man flamboyantly dressed who wore his hair long whowas afflicted with sore eyes and the collar of whose velvet coat wassprinkled with dandruff thats Hartrath the artist man absolutelydevoid of even the commonest decency
How he got in here is mystery tomeYet when this Hartrath came across to say How do you do to LymanLyman was as eager in his cordiality as his warmest friend could haveexpected
Why the devil are you so chummy with him then observed Harran whenHartrath had gone away
Lymans explanation was vague
The truth of the matter was thatMagnuss oldest son was consumed by inordinate ambition
Politicalpreferment was his dream and to the realisation of this dreampopularity was an essential
Every man who could vote blackguard orgentleman was to be conciliated if possible
He made it his study tobecome known throughout the entire communityto put influential menunder obligations to himself
He never forgot name or face
Witheverybody he was the hailfellowwellmet
His ambition was not trivial
In his disregard for small things he resembled his father
Municipaloffice had no attraction for him
His goal was higher
He had plannedhis life twenty years ahead
Already Sheriffs Attorney AssistantDistrict Attorney and Railroad Commissioner he could if he desiredattain the office of District Attorney itself
Just now it was aquestion with him whether or not it would be politic to fill thisoffice
Would it advance or sidetrack him in the career he had outlinedfor himself
Lyman wanted to be something better than District Attorneybetter than Mayor than State Senator or even than member of the UnitedStates Congress
He wanted to be in fact what his father was only innameto succeed where Magnus had failed
He wanted to be governorof the State
He had put his teeth together and deaf to all otherconsiderations blind to all other issues he worked with the infiniteslowness the unshakable tenacity of the coral insect to this one end
After luncheon was over Lyman ordered cigars and liqueurs and withthe three others returned to the main room of the club
However theirformer place in the round window was occupied
middleaged manwith iron grey hair and moustache who wore frock coat and whitewaistcoat and in some indefinable manner suggested retired navalofficer was sitting at their table smoking long thin cigar
At sightof him Presley became animated
He uttered mild exclamationWhy isnt that Mr CedarquistCedarquist repeated Lyman Derrick
know him well
Yes of courseit is he continued
Governor you must know him
He is one of ourrepresentative men
You would enjoy talking to him
He was the head ofthe big Atlas Iron Works
They have shut down recently you know
Not failed exactly but just ceased to be paying investment andCedarquist closed them out
He has other interests though
Hes richmana capitalistLyman brought the group up to the gentleman in question and introducedthem
Magnus Derrick of course observed Cedarquist as he tookthe Governors hand
Ive known you by repute for some time sir
Thisis great pleasure assure you Then turning to Presley he addedHello Pres my boy
How is the great the very great Poem getting onIts not getting on at all sir answered Presley in someembarrassment as they all sat down
In fact Ive about given up theidea
Theres so much interest in what you might call living issuesdown at Los Muertos now that Im getting further and further from itevery dayI should say as much remarked the manufacturer turning towardsMagnus
Im watching your fight with Shelgrim Mr Derrick with everydegree of interest He raised his drink of whiskey and soda
Heressuccess to youAs he replaced his glass the artist Hartrath joined the groupuninvited
As pretext he engaged Lyman in conversation
Lyman hebelieved was man with pull at the City Hall
In connection with aprojected MillionDollar Fair and Flower Festival which at that momentwas the talk of the city certain statues were to be erected andHartrath bespoke Lymans influence to further the pretensions of asculptor friend of his who wished to be Art Director of the affair
Inthe matter of this Fair and Flower Festival Hartrath was not lacking inenthusiasm
He addressed the others with extravagant gestures blinkinghis inflamed eyelids
million dollars he exclaimed
think of that
Why do you knowthat we have five hundred thousand practically pledged already
Talkabout public spirit gentlemen this is the most publicspirited cityon the continent
And the money is not thrown away
We will have Easternvisitors here by the thousandscapitalistsmen with money to invest
The million we spend on our fair will be money in our pockets
Ah youshould see how the women of this city are taking hold of the matter
They are giving all kinds of little entertainments teas Olde TymeSinging Skules amateur theatricals gingerbread fetes all for thebenefit of the fund and the business men toopouring out their moneylike water
It is splendid splendid to see community so patrioticThe manufacturer Cedarquist fixed the artist with glance ofmelancholy interest
And how much he remarked will they contributeyour gingerbreadwomen and publicspirited capitalists towards the blowing up of theruins of the Atlas Iron WorksBlowing up
dont understand murmured the artist surprised
Whenyou get your Eastern capitalists out here with your MillionDollarFair continued Cedarquist you dont propose do you to let them seea MillionDollar Iron Foundry standing idle because of the indifferenceof San Francisco business men
They might ask pertinent questionsyour capitalists and we should have to answer that our business menpreferred to invest their money in corner lots and government bondsrather than to back up legitimate industrial enterprise
We dontwant fairs
We want active furnaces
We dont want public statues andfountains and park extensions and gingerbread fetes
We want businessenterprise
Isnt it like us
Isnt it like us he exclaimed sadly
What melancholy comment
San Francisco
It is not cityit is aMidway Plaisance
California likes to be fooled
Do you suppose Shelgrimcould convert the whole San Joaquin Valley into his back yard otherwise
Indifference to public affairsabsolute indifference it stamps us all
Our State is the very paradise of fakirs
You and your MillionDollarFair He turned to Hartrath with quiet smile
It is just such menas you Mr Hartrath that are the ruin of us
You organise sham oftinsel and pasteboard put on fools cap and bells beat gong at astreet corner and the crowd cheers you and drops nickels into your hat
Your gingerbread fete yes saw it in full blast the other night onthe grounds of one of your womens places on Sutter Street
was on myway home from the last board meeting of the Atlas Company
gingerbreadfete my God
and the Atlas plant shutting down for want of financialbacking
million dollars spent to attract the Eastern investor inorder to show him an abandoned rolling mill wherein the only activityis the sale of remnant material and scrap steelLyman however interfered
The situation was becoming strained
Hetried to conciliate the three menthe artist the manufacturer and thefarmer the warring elements
But Hartrath unwilling to face the enmitythat he felt accumulating against him took himself away
picture ofhisA Study of the Contra Costa Foothillswas to be raffled in theclub rooms for the benefit of the Fair
He himself was in charge ofthe matter
He disappeared
Cedarquist looked after him with contemplative interest
Then turningto Magnus excused himself for the acridity of his words
Hes no worse than many others and the people of this State and cityare after all only little more addleheaded than other Americans It was his favourite topic
Sure of the interest of his hearers heunburdened himself
If were to name the one crying evil of American life Mr Derrick he continued it would be the indifference of the better people topublic affairs
It is so in all our great centres
There are other greattrusts God knows in the United States besides our own dear and SW Railroad
Every State has its own grievance
If it is not railroadtrust it is sugar trust or an oil trust or an industrial trustthat exploits the People BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ALLOW IT
The indifferenceof the People is the opportunity of the despot
It is as true as thatthe whole is greater than the part and the maxim is so old that it istriteit is laughable
It is neglected and disused for the sake ofsome new ingenious and complicated theory some wonderful scheme ofreorganisation but the fact remains nevertheless simple fundamentaleverlasting
The People have but to say No and not the strongesttyranny political religious or financial that was ever organisedcould survive one weekThe others absorbed attentive approved nodding their heads insilence as the manufacturer finished
Thats one reason Mr Derrick the other resumed after moment whyI have been so glad to meet you
You and your League are trying to sayNo to the trust
hope you will succeed
If your example will rallythe People to your cause you will
Otherwise he shook his head
One stage of the fight is to be passed this very day observed Magnus
My sons and myself are expecting hourly news from the City Hall adecision in our case is pendingWe are both of us fighters it seems Mr Derrick said Cedarquist
Each with his particular enemy
We are well met indeed the farmer andthe manufacturer both in the same grist between the two millstonesof the lethargy of the Public and the aggression of the Trust the twogreat evils of modern America
Pres my boy there is your epic poemready to handBut Cedarquist was full of another idea
Rarely did so favourable anopportunity present itself for explaining his theories his ambitions
Addressing himself to Magnus he continuedFortunately for myself the Atlas Company was not my only investment
have other interests
The building of shipssteel sailing shipshasbeen an ambition of minefor this purpose Mr Derrick to carryAmerican wheat
For years have studied this question of Americanwheat and at last have arrived at theory
Let me explain
Atpresent all our California wheat goes to Liverpool and from that portis distributed over the world
But change is coming
am sure of it
You young men he turned to Presley Lyman and Harran will live tosee it
Our century is about done
The great word of this nineteenthcentury has been Production
The great word of the twentieth centurywill belisten to me you youngstersMarkets
As market for ourProductionor let me take concrete exampleas market for ourWHEAT Europe is played out
Population in Europe is not increasing fastenough to keep up with the rapidity of our production
In some casesas in France the population is stationary
WE however have gone onproducing wheat at tremendous rate
The result is overproduction
We supply more than Europe can eat anddown go the prices
The remedy is NOT in the curtailing of our wheatareas but in this we MUST HAVE NEW MARKETS GREATER MARKETS
For yearswe have been sending our wheat from East to West from California toEurope
But the time will come when we must send it from West to East
We must march with the course of empire not against it
mean wemust look to China
Rice in China is losing its nutritive quality
TheAsiatics though must be fed if not on rice then on wheat
Why MrDerrick if only onehalf the population of China ate half ounce offlour per man per day all the wheat areas in California could not feedthem
Ah if could only hammer that into the brains of every rancherof the San Joaquin yes and of every owner of every bonanza farm inDakota and Minnesota
Send your wheat to China handle it yourselvesdo away with the middleman break up the Chicago wheat pits and elevatorrings and mixing houses
When in feeding China you have decreased theEuropean shipments the effect is instantaneous
Prices go up in Europewithout having the least effect upon the prices in China
We hold thekey we have the wheatinfinitely more than we ourselves can eat
Asia and Europe must look to America to be fed
What fatuous neglect ofopportunity to continue to deluge Europe with our surplus food when theEast trembles upon the verge of starvationThe two men Cedarquist and Magnus continued the conversation littlefurther
The manufacturers idea was new to the Governor
He was greatlyinterested
He withdrew from the conversation
Thoughtful he leanedback in his place stroking the bridge of his beaklike nose with acrooked forefinger
Cedarquist turned to Harran and began asking details as to theconditions of the wheat growers of the San Joaquin
Lyman stillmaintained an attitude of polite aloofness yawning occasionally behindthree fingers and Presley was left to the company of his own thoughts
There had been day when the affairs and grievances of the farmers ofhis acquaintanceMagnus Annixter Osterman and old Brodersonhadfilled him only with disgust
His mind full of great vague epic poemof the West he had kept himself apart disdainful of what he chose toconsider their petty squabbles
But the scene in Annixters harness roomhad thrilled and uplifted him
He was palpitating with excitement allthrough the succeeding months
He abandoned the idea of an epic poem
Insix months he had not written single verse
Day after day he trembledwith excitement as the relations between the Trust and League becamemore and more strained
He saw the matter in its true light
It wastypical
It was the worldold war between Freedom and Tyranny and attimes his hatred of the railroad shook him like crisp and witheredreed while the languid indifference of the people of the State to thequarrel filled him with blind exasperation
But as he had once explained to Vanamee he must find expression
Hefelt that he would suffocate otherwise
He had begun to keep journal
As the inclination spurred him he wrote down his thoughts and ideas inthis sometimes every day sometimes only three or four times month
Also he flung aside his books of poemsMilton Tennyson Browning evenHomerand addressed himself to Mill Malthus Young Poushkin HenryGeorge Schopenhauer
He attacked the subject of Social Inequality withunbounded enthusiasm
He devoured rather than read and emerged fromthe affair his mind confused jumble of conflicting notions sick withovereffort raging against injustice and oppression and with not onesane suggestion as to remedy or redress
The butt of his cigarette scorched his fingers and roused him from hisbrooding
In the act of lighting another he glanced across the roomand was surprised to see two very prettily dressed young women in thecompany of an older gentleman in long frock coat standing beforeHartraths painting examining it their heads upon one side
Presley uttered murmur of surprise
He himself was member of theclub and the presence of women within its doors except on specialoccasions was not tolerated
He turned to Lyman Derrick for anexplanation but this other had also seen the women and abruptlyexclaimedI declare had forgotten about it
Why this is Ladies Day ofcourseWhy yes interposed Cedarquist glancing at the women over hisshoulder
Didnt you know
They let em in twice year you rememberand this is double occasion
They are going to raffle Hartrathspicturefor the benefit of the Gingerbread Fair
Why you are notup to date Lyman
This is sacred and religious ritean importantpublic eventOf course of course murmured Lyman
He found means to survey Harranand Magnus
Certainly neither his father nor his brother were dressedfor the function that impended
He had been stupid
Magnus invariablyattracted attention and now with his trousers strapped under his bootshis wrinkled frock coatLyman twisted his cuffs into sight with animpatient nervous movement of his wrists glancing second time athis brothers pink face forward curling yellow hair and clothes ofa country cut
But there was no help for it
He wondered what were theclub regulations in the matter of bringing in visitors on Ladies Day
Sure enough Ladies Day he remarked am very glad you struck itGovernor
We can sit right where we are
guess this is as good placeas any to see the crowd
Its good chance to see all the big guns ofthe city
Do you expect your people here Mr CedarquistMy wife may come and my daughters said the manufacturer
Ah murmured Presley so much the better
was going to give myselfthe pleasure of calling upon your daughters Mr Cedarquist thisafternoonYou can save your carfare Pres said Cedarquist you will see themhereNo doubt the invitations for the occasion had appointed one oclock asthe time for between that hour and two the guests arrived in an almostunbroken stream
From their point of vantage in the round window of themain room Magnus his two sons and Presley looked on very interested
Cedarquist had excused himself affirming that he must look out for hiswomen folk
Of every ten of the arrivals seven at least were ladies
Theyentered the roomthis unfamiliar masculine haunt where their husbandsbrothers and sons spent so much of their timewith certain show ofhesitancy and little nervous oblique glances moving their heads fromside to side like file of hens venturing into strange barn
Theycame in groups ushered by single member of the club doing thehonours with effusive bows and polite gestures indicating the variousobjects of interest pictures busts and the like that decorated theroom
Fresh from his recollections of Bonneville Guadalajara and the dancein Annixters barn Presley was astonished at the beauty of these womenand the elegance of their toilettes
The crowd thickened rapidly
Amurmur of conversation arose subdued gracious mingled with the softrustle of silk grenadines velvet
The scent of delicate perfumesspread in the air Violet de Parme Peau dEspagne
Colours of the mostharmonious blends appeared and disappeared at intervals in the slowlymoving press touches of lavendertinted velvets pale violet crepes andcreamcoloured appliqued laces
There seemed to be no need of introductions
Everybody appeared tobe acquainted
There was no awkwardness no constraint
The assemblydisengaged an impression of refined pleasure
On every hand innumerabledialogues seemed to go forward easily and naturally without break orinterruption witty engaging the couple never at loss for repartee
third party was gracefully included then fourth
Little groups wereformedgroups that divided themselves or melted into other groupsor disintegrated again into isolated pairs or lost themselves inthe background of the massall without friction withoutembarrassmentthe whole affair going forward of itself decoroustactful wellbred
At distance and not too loud stringed orchestra sent up pleasinghum
Waiters with brass buttons on their full dress coats went fromgroup to group silent unobtrusive serving salads and ices
But the focus of the assembly was the little space before Hartrathspainting
It was called Study of the Contra Costa Foothills andwas set in frame of natural redwood the bark still adhering
It wasconspicuously displayed on an easel at the right of the entrance to themain room of the club and was very large
In the foreground and tothe left under the shade of liveoak stood couple of reddish cowskneedeep in patch of yellow poppies while in the righthand cornerto balance the composition was placed girl in pink dress and whitesunbonnet in which the shadows were indicated by broad dashes of paleblue paint
The ladies and young girls examined the production withlittle murmurs of admiration hazarding remembered phrasessearching for the exact balance between generous praise and criticaldiscrimination expressing their opinions in the mild technicalities ofthe Art Books and painting classes
They spoke of atmospheric effectsof middle distance of chiarooscuro of foreshortening of thedecomposition of light of the subordination of individuality tofidelity of interpretation
One tall girl with hair almost white in its blondness having observedthat the handling of the masses reminded her strongly of Corot hercompanion who carried gold lorgnette by chain around her neckansweredAh
Millet perhaps but not CorotThis verdict had an immediate success
It was passed from group togroup
It seemed to imply delicate distinction that carried convictionat once
It was decided formally that the reddish brown cows in thepicture were reminiscent of Daubigny and that the handling of themasses was altogether Millet but that the general effect was not quiteCorot
Presley curious to see the painting that was the subject of so muchdiscussion had left the group in the round window and stood close byHartrath craning his head over the shoulders of the crowd trying tocatch glimpse of the reddish cows the milkmaid and the blue paintedfoothills
He was suddenly aware of Cedarquists voice in his ear andturning about found himself face to face with the manufacturer hiswife and his two daughters
There was meeting
Salutations were exchanged Presley shaking handsall around expressing his delight at seeing his old friends once morefor he had known the family from his boyhood Mrs Cedarquist being hisaunt
Mrs Cedarquist and her two daughters declared that the air of LosMuertos must certainly have done him world of good
He was stouterthere could be no doubt of it
little pale perhaps
He was fatiguinghimself with his writing no doubt
Ah he must take care
Health waseverything after all
Had he been writing any more verse
Every monththey scanned the magazines looking for his name
Mrs Cedarquist was fashionable woman the president or chairman ofa score of clubs
She was forever running after fads appearingcontinually in the society wherein she moved with new and astoundingprotegesfakirs whom she unearthed no one knew where discovering themlong in advance of her companions
Now it was Russian Countess withdirty finger nails who travelled throughout America and borrowed moneynow an Aesthete who possessed wonderful collection of topaz gems whosubmitted decorative schemes for the interior arrangement of houses andwho received in Mrs Cedarquists drawingrooms dressed in whitevelvet cassock now widow of some Mohammedan of Bengal or Rajputanawho had blue spot in the middle of her forehead and who solicitedcontributions for her sisters in affliction now certain bearded poetrecently back from the Klondike now decayed musician who had beenejected from young ladies musical conservatory of Europe becauseof certain surprising pamphlets on free love and who had come to SanFrancisco to introduce the community to the music of Brahms now aJapanese youth who wore spectacles and grey flannel shirt and whoat intervals delivered himself of the most astonishing poems vagueunrhymed unmetrical lucubrations incoherent bizarre now ChristianScientist lean grey woman whose creed was neither Christian norscientific now university professor with the bristling beard ofan anarchist chiefofsection and roaring guttural voice whoseintenseness left him gasping and apoplectic now civilised Cherokeewith mission now female elocutionist whose forte was Byrons Songsof Greece now high caste Chinaman now miniature painter now atenor pianiste mandolin player missionary drawing mastera virtuoso collector an Armenian botanist with new flower acritic with new theory doctor with new treatment
And all these people had veritable mania for declamation and fancydress
The Russian Countess gave talks on the prisons of Siberiawearing the headdress and pinchbeck ornaments of Slav bride theAesthete in his white cassock gave readings on obscure questionsof art and ethics
The widow of India in the costume of her castedescribed the social life of her people at home
The bearded poetperspiring in furs and boots of reindeer skin declaimed verses of hisown composition about the wild life of the Alaskan mining camps
TheJapanese youth in the silk robes of the Samurai twosworded noblesread from his own worksThe flatbordered earth nailed down at nightrusting under the darkness The brave upright rains that came downlike errands from ironbodied yoretime The Christian Scientist infunereal impressive black discussed the contrawill and panpsychichylozoism
The university professor put on full dress suit and lislethread gloves at three in the afternoon and before literary clubs andcircles bellowed extracts from Goethe and Schiler in the German shakinghis fists purple with vehemence
The Cherokee arrayed in fringedbuckskin and blue beads rented from costumer intoned folk songs ofhis people in the vernacular
The elocutionist in cheesecloth toga andtin bracelets rendered The Isles of Greece where burning Sappholoved and sung The Chinaman in the robes of mandarin lecturedon Confucius
The Armenian in fez and baggy trousers spoke of theUnspeakable Turk
The mandolin player dressed like bull fighter heldmusical conversaziones interpreting the peasant songs of Andalusia
It was the Fake the eternal irrepressible Sham glib nimbleubiquitous tricked out in all the paraphernalia of imposture anendless defile of charlatans that passed interminably before the gaze ofthe city marshalled by lady presidents exploited by clubs of womenby literary societies reading circles and culture organisations
Theattention the Fake received the time devoted to it the money which itabsorbed were incredible
It was all one that impostor after impostorwas exposed it was all one that the clubs the circles the societieswere proved beyond doubt to have been swindled
The more the Philistinepress of the city railed and guyed the more the women rallied tothe defence of their protege of the hour
That their favourite waspersecuted was to them veritable rapture
Promptly they invested theapostle of culture with the glamour of martyr
The fakirs worked the community as shellgame tricksters work countyfair departing with bursting pocketbooks passing on the word to thenext in line assured that the place was not worked out knowing wellthat there was enough for all
More frequently the public of the city unable to think of more than onething at one time prostrated itself at the feet of single apostlebut at other moments such as the present when Flower Festival or aMillionDollar Fair aroused enthusiasm in all quarters the occasionwas one of gala for the entire Fake
The decayed professors virtuosilitterateurs and artists thronged to the place en masse
Their clamourfilled all the air
On every hand one heard the scraping of violinsthe tinkling of mandolins the suave accents of art talks theincoherencies of poets the declamation of elocutionists theinarticulate wanderings of the Japanese the confused mutterings of theCherokee the guttural bellowing of the German university professor allin the name of the MillionDollar Fair
Money to the extent of hundredsof thousands was set in motion
Mrs Cedarquist was busy from morning until night
One after anothershe was introduced to newly arrived fakirs
To each poet to eachlitterateur to each professor she addressed the same questionHow long have you known you had this powerShe spent her days in one quiver of excitement and jubilation
Shewas in the movement The people of the city were awakening to aRealisation of the Beautiful to sense of the higher needs of life
This was Art this was Literature this was Culture and Refinement
TheRenaissance had appeared in the West
She was short rather stout redfaced very much overdressed littlewoman of some fifty years
She was rich in her own name even beforeher marriage being relative of Shelgrim himself and on familiar termswith the great financier and his family
Her husband while deploringthe policy of the railroad saw no good reason for quarrelling withShelgrim and on more than one occasion had dined at his house
On thisoccasion delighted that she had come upon minor poet she insistedupon presenting him to Hartrath
You two should have so much in common she explained
Presley shook the flaccid hand of the artist murmuringconventionalities while Mrs Cedarquist hastened to sayI am sure you know Mr Presleys verse Mr Hartrath
You shouldbelieve me
You two have much in common
can see so much that is alikein your modes of interpreting nature
In Mr Presleys sonnet TheBetter Part there is the same note as in your picture the samesincerity of tone the same subtlety of touch the same nuancesahOh my dear Madame murmured the artist interrupting Presleysimpatient retort am mere bungler
You dont mean quite that amsure
am too sensitive
It is my cross
Beauty he closed his soreeyes with little expression of pain beauty unmans meBut Mrs Cedarquist was not listening
Her eyes were fixed on theartists luxuriant hair thick and glossy mane that all but coveredhis coat collar
Leonine she murmured leonine
Like Samson of oldHowever abruptly bestirring herself she exclaimed second laterBut must run away
am selling tickets for you this afternoon MrHartrath
am having such success
Twentyfive already
Mr Presleyyou will take two chances am sure and oh by the way have suchgood news
You know am one of the lady members of the subscriptioncommittee for our Fair and you know we approached Mr Shelgrim for adonation to help along
Oh such liberal patron real Lorenzo diMedici
In the name of the Pacific and Southwestern he has subscribedthink of it five thousand dollars and yet they will talk of themeanness of the railroadPossibly it is to his interest murmured Presley
The fairs andfestivals bring people to the city over his railroadBut the others turned on him expostulating
Ah you Philistine declared Mrs Cedarquist
And this from YOUPresley to attribute such base motivesIf the poets become materialised Mr Presley declared Hartrathwhat can we say to the peopleAnd Shelgrim encourages your milliondollar fairs and fetes said avoice at Presleys elbow because it is throwing dust in the peopleseyesThe group turned about and saw Cedarquist who had come up unobservedin time to catch the drift of the talk
But he spoke without bitternessthere was even goodhumoured twinkle in his eyes
Yes he continued smiling our dear Shelgrim promotes your fairsnot only as Pres says because it is money in his pocket but becauseit amuses the people distracts their attention from the doings of hisrailroad
When Beatrice was baby and had little colics used tojingle my keys in front of her nose and it took her attention from thepain in her tummy so ShelgrimThe others laughed goodhumouredly protesting nevertheless and MrsCedarquist shook her finger in warning at the artist and exclaimedThe Philistines be upon thee SamsonBy the way observed Hartrath willing to change the subject hearyou are on the Famine Relief Committee
Does your work progressOh most famously assure you she said
Such movement as wehave started
Those poor creatures
The photographs of them are simplydreadful
had the committee to luncheon the other day and we passedthem around
We are getting subscriptions from all over the State andMr Cedarquist is to arrange for the shipThe Relief Committee in question was one of great number that had beenformed in Californiaand all over the Union for the matter of thattoprovide relief for the victims of great famine in Central India
Thewhole world had been struck with horror at the reports of sufferingand mortality in the affected districts and had hastened to send aid
Certain women of San Francisco with Mrs Cedarquist at their head hadorganised number of committees but the manufacturers wife turned themeetings of these committees into social affairsluncheons teas whereone discussed the ways and means of assisting the starving Asiatics overteacups and plates of salad
Shortly afterward mild commotion spread throughout the assemblage ofthe clubs guests
The drawing of the numbers in the raffle was about tobe made
Hartrath in flurry of agitation excused himself
Cedarquisttook Presley by the arm
Pres lets get out of this he said
Come into the wine room and Iwill shake you for glass of sherryThey had some difficulty in extricating themselves
The main room wherethe drawing was to take place suddenly became densely thronged
All theguests pressed eagerly about the table near the picture upon which oneof the hall boys had just placed ballot box containing the numbers
The ladies holding their tickets in their hands pushed forward
Astaccato chatter of excited murmurs arose
What became of Harran andLyman and the Governor inquired Presley
Lyman had disappeared alleging business engagement but Magnus andhis younger son had retired to the library of the club on the floorabove
It was almost deserted
They were deep in earnest conversation
Harran said the Governor with decision there is deal there inwhat Cedarquist says
Our wheat to China hey boyIt is certainly worth thinking of sirIt appeals to me boy it appeals to me
Its big and theres fortunein it
Big chances mean big returns and knowyour old father isnt aback number yet HarranI may not have so wide an outlook as our friendCedarquist but am quick to see my chance
Boy the whole East isopening disintegrating before the AngloSaxon
It is time that breadstuffs as well should make markets for themselves in the Orient
Justat this moment too when Lyman will scale down freight rates so we canhaul to tidewater at little costMagnus paused again his frown beetling and in the silence theexcited murmur from the main room of the club the soprano chatter of amultitude of women found its way to the deserted library
believe its worth looking into Governor asserted Harran
Magnus rose and his hands behind him paced the floor of the librarya couple of times his imagination all stimulated and vivid
Thegreat gambler perceived his Chance the kaleidoscopic shifting ofcircumstances that made Situation
It had come silently unexpectedly
He had not seen its approach
Abruptly he woke one morning to see thecombination realised
But also he saw vision
sudden and abruptrevolution in the Wheat
new world of markets discovered the matteras important as the discovery of America
The torrent of wheat was to bediverted flowing back upon itself in sudden colossal eddy strandingthe middleman the ENTREPRENEUR the elevatorand mixinghouse mendry and despairing their occupation gone
He saw the farmer suddenlyemancipated the worlds food no longer at the mercy of the speculatorthousands upon thousands of men set free of the grip of Trust and ringand monopoly acting for themselves selling their own wheat organisinginto one gigantic trust themselves sending their agents to all theentry ports of China
Himself Annixter Broderson and Osterman wouldpool their issues
He would convince them of the magnificence of the newmovement
They would be its pioneers
Harran would be sent to Hong Kongto represent the four
They would charterprobably buya ship perhapsone of Cedarquists American built the nations flag at the peak andthe sailing of that ship gorged with the crops from Brodersons andOstermans ranches from Quien Sabe and Los Muertos would be like thesailing of the caravels from Palos
It would mark new era it wouldmake an epoch
With this vision still expanding before the eye of his mind Magnuswith Harran at his elbow prepared to depart
They descended to the lower floor and involved themselves for momentin the throng of fashionables that blocked the hallway and the entranceto the main room where the numbers of the raffle were being drawn
Nearthe head of the stairs they encountered Presley and Cedarquist who hadjust come out of the wine room
Magnus still on fire with the new idea pressed few questions uponthe manufacturer before bidding him goodbye
He wished to talk furtherupon the great subject interested as to details but Cedarquist wasvague in his replies
He was no farmer he hardly knew wheat when he sawit only he knew the trend of the worlds affairs he felt them to besetting inevitably eastward
However his very vagueness was further inspiration to the Governor
He swept details aside
He saw only the grand coup the huge resultsthe East conquered the march of empire rolling westward finallyarriving at its starting point the vague mysterious Orient
He saw his wheat like the crest of an advancing billow crossing thePacific bursting upon Asia flooding the Orient in golden torrent
Itwas the new era
He had lived to see the death of the old and the birthof the new first the mine now the ranch first gold now wheat
Onceagain he became the pioneer hardy brilliant taking colossal chancesblazing the way grasping fortunea million in single day
All thebigness of his nature leaped up again within him
At the magnitude ofthe inspiration he felt young again indomitable the leader at lastking of his fellows wresting from fortune at this eleventh hour beforehis old age the place of high command which so long had been deniedhim
At last he could achieve
Abruptly Magnus was aware that some one had spoken his name
He lookedabout and saw behind him at little distance two gentlemen strangersto him
They had withdrawn from the crowd into little recess
Evidently having no women to look after they had lost interest in theafternoons affair
Magnus realised that they had not seen him
One ofthem was reading aloud to his companion from an evening edition of thatdays newspaper
It was in the course of this reading that Magnus caughtthe sound of his name
He paused listening and Presley Harran andCedarquist followed his example
Soon they all understood
They werelistening to the report of the judges decision for which Magnus waswaitingthe decision in the case of the League vs the Railroad
Forthe moment the polite clamour of the raffle hushed itselfthe winningnumber was being drawn
The guests held their breath and in the ensuingsilence Magnus and the others heard these words distinctly
It follows that the title to the lands in question is in theplaintiffthe Pacific and Southwestern Railroad and the defendantshave no title and their possession is wrongful
There must be findingsand judgment for the plaintiff and it is so orderedIn spite of himself Magnus paled
Harran shut his teeth with an oath
Their exaltation of the previous moment collapsed like pyramid ofcards
The vision of the new movement of the wheat the conquest of theEast the invasion of the Orient seemed only the flimsiest mockery
With brusque wrench they were snatched back to reality
Betweenthem and the vision between the fecund San Joaquin reeking withfruitfulness and the millions of Asia crowding toward the verge ofstarvation lay the ironhearted monster of steel and steam implacableinsatiable hugeits entrails gorged with the life blood that itsucked from an entire commonwealth its ever hungry maw glutted with theharvests that should have fed the famished bellies of the whole world ofthe Orient
But abruptly while the four men stood there gazing into each othersfaces vigorous handclapping broke out
The raffle of Hartrathspicture was over and as Presley turned about he saw Mrs Cedarquistand her two daughters signalling eagerly to the manufacturer unable toreach him because of the intervening crowd
Then Mrs Cedarquist raisedher voice and criedIve won
Ive wonUnnoticed and with but brief word to Cedarquist Magnus and Harranwent down the marble steps leading to the street door silent Harransarm tight around his fathers shoulder
At once the orchestra struck into lively air
renewed murmur ofconversation broke out and Cedarquist as he said goodbye to Presleylooked first at the retreating figures of the ranchers then at thegayly dressed throng of beautiful women and debonair young men andindicating the whole scene with single gesture said smiling sadly ashe spokeNot city Presley not city but Midway PlaisanceCHAPTER IIUnderneath the Long Trestle where Broderson Creek cut the line of therailroad and the Upper Road the ground was low and covered with asecond growth of grey green willows
Along the borders of the creek wereoccasional marshy spots and now and then Hilma Tree came here to gatherwatercresses which she made into salads
The place was picturesque secluded an oasis of green shade in all thelimitless flat monotony of the surrounding wheat lands
The creek haderoded deep into the little gully and no matter how hot it was on thebaking shimmering levels of the ranches above down here one alwaysfound ones self enveloped in an odorous moist coolness
From time totime the incessant murmur of the creek pouring over and around thelarger stones was interrupted by the thunder of trains roaring outupon the trestle overhead passing on with the furious gallop of theirhundreds of iron wheels leaving in the air taint of hot oil acridsmoke and reek of escaping steam
On certain afternoon in the spring of the year Hilma was returningto Quien Sabe from Hoovens by the trail that led from Los Muertos toAnnixters ranch houses under the trestle
She had spent the afternoonwith Minna Hooven who for the time being was kept indoors because ofa wrenched ankle
As Hilma descended into the gravel flats and thicketsof willows underneath the trestle she decided that she would gathersome cresses for her supper that night
She found spot around the baseof one of the supports of the trestle where the cresses grew thickestand plucked couple of handfuls washing them in the creek and pinningthem up in her handkerchief
It made little round cold bundle andHilma warm from her walk found delicious enjoyment in pressing thedamp ball of it to her cheeks and neck
For all the change that Annixter had noted in her upon the occasion ofthe barn dance Hilma remained in many things young child
She wasnever at loss for enjoyment and could always amuse herself when leftalone
Just now she chose to drink from the creek lying prone on theground her face halfburied in the water and this not because she wasthirsty but because it was new way to drink
She imagined herself abelated traveller poor girl an outcast quenching her thirst at thewayside brook her little packet of cresses doing duty for bundle ofclothes
Night was coming on
Perhaps it would storm
She had nowhere togo
She would apply at hut for shelter
Abruptly the temptation to dabble her feet in the creek presenteditself to her
Always she had liked to play in the water
What delightnow to take off her shoes and stockings and wade out into the shallowsnear the bank
She had worn low shoes that afternoon and the dust ofthe trail had filtered in above the edges
At times she felt the gritand grey sand on the soles of her feet and the sensation had sether teeth on edge
What delicious alternative the cold clean watersuggested and how easy it would be to do as she pleased just then ifonly she were little girl
In the end it was stupid to be grown up
Sitting upon the bank one finger tucked into the heel of her shoeHilma hesitated
Suppose train should come
She fancied she could seethe engineer leaning from the cab with great grin on his face or thebrakeman shouting gibes at her from the platform
Abruptly she blushedscarlet
The blood throbbed in her temples
Her heart beat
Since thefamous evening of the barn dance Annixter had spoken to her but twice
Hilma no longer looked after the ranch house these days
The thought ofsetting foot within Annixters diningroom and bedroom terrified herand in the end her mother had taken over that part of her work
Of thetwo meetings with the master of Quien Sabe one had been mere exchangeof good mornings as the two happened to meet over by the artesian wellthe other more complicated had occurred in the dairyhouse againAnnixter pretending to look over the new cheese press asking aboutdetails of her work
When this had happened on that previous occasionending with Annixters attempt to kiss her Hilma had been talkativeenough chattering on from one subject to another never at loss for atheme
But this last time was veritable ordeal
No sooner hadAnnixter appeared than her heart leaped and quivered like that of thehoundharried doe
Her speech failed her
Throughout the whole briefinterview she had been miserably tonguetied stammering monosyllablesconfused horribly awkward and when Annixter had gone away she hadfled to her little room and bolting the door had flung herself facedownward on the bed and wept as though her heart were breaking she didnot know why
That Annixter had been overwhelmed with business all through the winterwas an inexpressible relief to Hilma
His affairs took him away from theranch continually
He was absent sometimes for weeks making tripsto San Francisco or to Sacramento or to Bonneville
Perhaps he wasforgetting her overlooking her and while at first she told herselfthat she asked nothing better the idea of it began to occupy her mind
She began to wonder if it was really so
She knew his trouble
Everybody did
The news of the sudden forwardmovement of the Railroads forces inaugurating the campaign had flaredwhitehot and blazing all over the country side
To Hilmas notionAnnixters attitude was heroic beyond all expression
His courage infacing the Railroad as he had faced Delaney in the barn seemed to herthe pitch of sublimity
She refused to see any auxiliaries aiding him inhis fight
To her imagination the great League which all the rancherswere joining was mere form
Singlehanded Annixter fronted themonster
But for him the corporation would gobble Quien Sabe as awhale would minnow
He was hero who stood between them all anddestruction
He was protector of her family
He was her champion
She began to mention him in her prayers every night adding furtherpetition to the effect that he would become good man and that heshould not swear so much and that he should never meet Delaney again
However as Hilma still debated the idea of bathing her feet in thecreek train did actually thunder past overheadthe regular eveningOverlandthe through express that never stopped between Bakersfieldand Fresno
It stormed by with deafening clamour and swirl ofsmoke in long succession of waycoaches and chocolate colouredPullmans grimy with the dust of the great deserts of the Southwest
The quivering of the trestles supports set tremble in the groundunderfoot
The thunder of wheels drowned all sound of the flowing of thecreek and also the noise of the buckskin mares hoofs descending fromthe trail upon the gravel about the creek so that Hilma turning aboutafter the passage of the train saw Annixter close at hand with theabruptness of vision
He was looking at her smiling as he rarely did the firm line of hisoutthrust lower lip relaxed goodhumouredly
He had taken off hiscampaign hat to her and though his stiff yellow hair was twistedinto bristling mop the little persistent tuft on the crown usuallydefiantly erect as an Apaches scalplock was nowhere in sight
Hello its you is it Miss Hilma he exclaimed getting down fromthe buckskin and allowing her to drink
Hilma nodded scrambling to her feet dusting her skirt with nervouspats of both hands
Annixter sat down on great rock close by and the loop of the bridleover his arm lit cigar and began to talk
He complained of the heatof the day the bad condition of the Lower Road over which he had comeon his way from committee meeting of the League at Los Muertos ofthe slowness of the work on the irrigating ditch and as matter ofcourse of the general hard times
Miss Hilma he said abruptly never you marry ranchman
Hes neverout of troubleHilma gasped her eyes widening till the full round of the pupil wasdisclosed
Instantly certain inexplicable guiltiness overpowered herwith incredible confusion
Her hands trembled as she pressed the bundleof cresses into hard ball between her palms
Annixter continued to talk
He was disturbed and excited himself atthis unexpected meeting
Never through all the past winter months ofstrenuous activity the fever of political campaigns the harrowingdelays and ultimate defeat in one law court after another had heforgotten the look in Hilmas face as he stood with one arm aroundher on the floor of his barn in peril of his life from the bustersrevolver
That dumb confession of Hilmas wideopen eyes had been enoughfor him
Yet somehow he never had had chance to act upon it
Duringthe short period when he could be on his ranch Hilma had always managedto avoid him
Once even she had spent month about Christmas timewith her mothers father who kept hotel in San Francisco
Now today however he had her all to himself
He would put an endto the situation that troubled him and vexed him day after daymonth after month
Beyond question the moment had come for somethingdefinite he could not say precisely what
Readjusting his cigar betweenhis teeth he resumed his speech
It suited his humour to take the girlinto his confidence following an instinct which warned him that thiswould bring about certain closeness of their relations certainintimacy
What do you think of this row anyways Miss Hilmathis railroadfuss in general
Think Shelgrim and his rushers are going to jump QuienSabeare going to run us off the ranchOh no sir protested Hilma still breathless
Oh no indeed notWell what thenHilma made little uncertain movement of ignorance
dont know whatWell the League agreed today that if the test cases were lost inthe Supreme Courtyou know weve appealed to the Supreme Court atWashingtonwed fightFightYes fightFight likelike you and Mr Delaney that time withoh dearwithgunsI dont know grumbled Annixter vaguely
What do YOU thinkHilmas lowpitched almost husky voice trembled little as shereplied Fightingwith gunsthats so terrible
Oh those revolversin the barn
can hear them yet
Every shot seemed like the explosionof tons of powderShall we clear out then
Shall we let Delaney have possession and SBehrman and all that lot
Shall we give in to themNever never she exclaimed her great eyes flashing
YOU wouldnt like to be turned out of your home would you Miss Hilmabecause Quien Sabe is your home isnt it
Youve lived here ever sinceyou were as big as minute
You wouldnt like to have Behrman andthe rest of em turn you outNno she murmured
No shouldnt like that
Theres mamma andWell do you think for one second Im going to let em criedAnnixter his teeth tightening on his cigar
You stay right whereyou are
Ill take care of you right enough
Look here he demandedabruptly youve no use for that roaring lush Delaney have you think he is wicked man she declared
know the Railroad haspretended to sell him part of the ranch and he lets Mr Behrman andMr Ruggles just use himRight
thought you wouldnt be keen on himThere was long pause
The buckskin began blowing among the pebblesnosing for grass and Annixter shifted his cigar to the other corner ofhis mouth
Pretty place he muttered looking around him
Then he added MissHilma see here want to have kind of talk with you if you dontmind
dont know just how to say these sort of things and if getall balled up as go along you just set it down to the fact that Ivenever had any experience in dealing with feemale girls understand
Yousee ever since the barn danceyes and long before thenIve beenthinking lot about you
Straight have and guess you know it
Youre about the only girl that ever knew well and guess hedeclared deliberately youre about the only one want to know
Its my nature
You didnt say anything that time when we stood theretogether and Delaney was playing the fool but somehow got the ideathat you didnt want Delaney to do for me one little bit that if hedgot me then you would have been sorrier than if hed got any one else
Well felt just that way about you
would rather have had him shootany other girl in the room than you yes or in the whole State
Why ifanything should happen to you Miss Hilmawell wouldnt care to goon with anything
Behrman could jump Quien Sabe and welcome
AndDelaney could shoot me full of holes whenever he got good and ready
Id quit
Id lay right down
wouldnt care whoop about anything anymore
You are the only girl for me in the whole world
didnt think soat first
didnt want to
But seeing you around every day and seeinghow pretty you were and how clever and hearing your voice and allwhy it just got all inside of me somehow and now cant think ofanything else
hate to go to San Francisco or Sacramento or Visaliaor even Bonneville for only day just because you arent there inany of those places and just rush what Ive got to do so as canget back here
While you were away that Christmas time why was aslonesome asoh you dont know anything about it
just scratched offthe days on the calendar every night one by one till you got back
And it just comes to this want you with me all the time
want youshould have home thats my home too
want to take care of you andhave you all for myself you understand
What do you sayHilma standing up before him retied knot in her handkerchief bundlewith elaborate precaution blinking at it through her tears
What do you say Miss Hilma Annixter repeated
How about that
Whatdo you sayJust above whisper Hilma murmuredII dont knowDont know what
Dont you think we could hit it off togetherI dont knowI know we could Hilma
dont mean to scare you
What are you cryingfor dont knowAnnixter got up cast away his cigar and dropping the buckskinsbridle came and stood beside her putting hand on her shoulder
Hilmadid not move and he felt her trembling
She still plucked at the knotof the handkerchief
cant do without you little girl Annixtercontinued and want you
want you bad
dont get much fun out oflife ever
It sure isnt my nature guess
Im hard man
Everybodyis trying to down me and now Im up against the Railroad
Im fightingem all Hilma night and day lock stock and barrel and Im fightingnow for my home my land everything have in the world
If win outI want somebody to be glad with me
If dontI want somebody to besorry for me sorry with meand that somebody is you
am dogtiredof going it alone
want some one to back me up
want to feel youalongside of me to give me touch of the shoulder now and then
Imtired of fighting for THINGSland property money
want to fight forsome PERSONsomebody beside myself
want to feel that itisnt all selfishnessthat there are other interests than mine in thegamethat theres some one dependent on me and thats thinking of meas Im thinking of themsome one can come home to at night and put myarm aroundlike this and have her put her two arms around melike He paused second and once again as it had been in that momentof imminent peril when he stood with his arm around her their eyesmetput her two arms around me prompted Annixter half smilinglikelike what HilmaI dont knowLike what Hilma he insisted
Likelike this she questioned
With movement of infinitetenderness and affection she slid her arms around his neck still cryinga little
The sensation of her warm body in his embrace the feeling of hersmooth round arm through the thinness of her sleeve pressing againsthis cheek thrilled Annixter with delight such as he had never known
He bent his head and kissed her upon the nape of her neck where thedelicate amber tint melted into the thick sweet smelling mass of herdark brown hair
She shivered little holding him closer ashamedas yet to look up
Without speech they stood there for long minuteholding each other close
Then Hilma pulled away from him mopping hertearstained cheeks with the little moist ball of her handkerchief
What do you say
Is it go demanded Annixter jovially
thought hated you all the time she said and the velvetyhuskiness of her voice never sounded so sweet to him
And thought it was that crockery smashing goat of lout of acowpuncherDelaney
The idea
Oh dear
think it must always have been youSince when Hilma he asked putting his arm around her
Ah but itis good to have you my girl he exclaimed delighted beyond words thatshe permitted this freedom
Since when
Tell us all about itOh since always
It was ever so long before came to think ofyouto well to think aboutI mean to rememberoh you know what Imean
But when did oh THENThen whatI dont knowI havent thoughtthat way long enough to knowBut you said you thought it must have been me alwaysI know but that was differentoh Im all mixed up
Im so nervousand trembly now
Oh she cried suddenly her face overcast with lookof earnestness and great seriousness both her hands catching at hiswrist Oh you WILL be good to me now wont you
Im only littlelittle child in so many ways and Ive given myself to you all in aminute and cant go back of it now and its for always
dont knowhow it happened or why
Sometimes think didnt wish it but now itsdone and am glad and happy
But NOW if you werent good to meohthink of how it would be with me
You are strong and big and rich andI am only servant of yours little nobody but Ive given all hadto youmyselfand you must be so good to me now
Always rememberthat
Be good to me and be gentle and kind to me in LITTLE thingsineverything or you will break my heartAnnixter took her in his arms
He was speechless
No words that he hadat his command seemed adequate
All he could say wasThats all right little girl
Dont you be frightened
Ill take careof you
Thats all right thats all rightFor long time they sat there under the shade of the great trestletheir arms about each other speaking only at intervals
An hour passed
The buckskin finding no feed to her taste took the trail stablewardsthe bridle dragging
Annixter let her go
Rather than to take his armfrom around Hilmas waist he would have lost his whole stable
At lasthowever he bestirred himself and began to talk
He thought it time toformulate some plan of action
Well now Hilma what are we going to doDo she repeated
Why must we do anything
Oh isnt this enoughTheres better ahead he went on
want to fix you up somewherewhere you can have bit of home all to yourself
Lets seeBonneville wouldnt do
Theres always lot of yaps about therethat know us and they would begin to cackle first off
How about SanFrancisco
We might go up next week and have look around
would findrooms you could take somewheres and we would fix em up as lovely ashowdoyoudoOh but why go away from Quien Sabe she protested
And then sosoon too
Why must we have wedding trip now that you are so busy
Wouldnt it be betteroh tell you we could go to Monterey afterwe were married for little week where mammas people live and thencome back here to the ranch house and settle right down where we are andlet me keep house for you
wouldnt even want single servantAnnixter heard and his face grew troubled
Hum he said seeHe gathered up handful of pebbles and began snapping them carefullyinto the creek
He fell thoughtful
Here was phase of the affair hehad not planned in the least
He had supposed all the time that Hilmatook his meaning
His old suspicion that she was trying to get hold onhim stirred again for moment
There was no good of such talk asthat
Always these feemale girls seemed crazy to get married bent oncomplicating the situation
Isnt that best said Hilma glancing at him
dont know he muttered gloomily
Well then lets not
Lets come right back to Quien Sabe withoutgoing to Monterey
Anything that you want wantI hadnt thought of it in just that way he observed
In what way thenCant wecant we wait about this marrying businessThats just it she said gayly
said it was too soon
There wouldbe so much to do between whiles
Why not say at the end of the summerSay whatOur marriage meanWhy get married then
Whats the good of all that fuss about it
Idont go anything upon minister puddling round in my affairs
Whatsthe difference anyhow
We understand each other
Isnt that enough
Pshaw Hilma IM no marrying manShe looked at him moment bewildered then slowly she took hismeaning
She rose to her feet her eyes wide her face paling withterror
He did not look at her but he could hear the catch in herthroat
Oh she exclaimed with long deep breath and again Oh the backof her hand against her lips
It was quick gasp of veritable physical anguish
Her eyes brimmedover
Annixter rose looking at her
Well he said awkwardly WellHilma leaped back from him with an instinctive recoil of her wholebeing throwing out her hands in gesture of defence fearing she knewnot what
There was as yet no sense of insult in her mind no outragedmodesty
She was only terrified
It was as though searching for wildflowers she had come suddenly upon snake
She stood for an instant spellbound her eyes wide her bosom swellingthen all at once turned and fled darting across the plank thatserved for foot bridge over the creek gaining the opposite bank anddisappearing with brisk rustle of underbrush such as might have beenmade by the flight of frightened fawn
Abruptly Annixter found himself alone
For moment he did not movethen he picked up his campaign hat carefully creased its limp crown andput it on his head and stood for moment looking vaguely at the groundon both sides of him
He went away without uttering word withoutchange of countenance his hands in his pockets his feet taking greatstrides along the trail in the direction of the ranch house
He had no sight of Hilma again that evening and the next morning hewas up early and did not breakfast at the ranch house
Business of theLeague called him to Bonneville to confer with Magnus and the firm oflawyers retained by the League to fight the landgrabbing cases
Anappeal was to be taken to the Supreme Court at Washington and it was tobe settled that day which of the cases involved should be considered astest cases
Instead of driving or riding into Bonneville as he usually didAnnixter took an early morning train the BakersfieldFresno local atGuadalajara and went to Bonneville by rail arriving there at twentyminutes after seven and breakfasting by appointment with Magnus Derrickand Osterman at the Yosemite House on Main Street
The conference of the committee with the lawyers took place in frontroom of the Yosemite one of the latter bringing with him his clerk whomade stenographic report of the proceedings and took carbon copiesof all letters written
The conference was long and complicated thebusiness transacted of the utmost moment and it was not until twooclock that Annixter found himself at liberty
However as he and Magnus descended into the lobby of the hotel theywere aware of an excited and interested group collected about the swingdoors that opened from the lobby of the Yosemite into the bar of thesame name
Dyke was thereeven at distance they could hear thereverberation of his deeptoned voice uplifted in wrath and furiousexpostulation
Magnus and Annixter joined the group wondering and allat once fell full upon the first scene of drama
That same morning Dykes mother had awakened him according to hisinstructions at daybreak
consignment of his hop poles from the northhad arrived at the freight office of the and in Bonneville andhe was to drive in on his farm wagon and bring them out
He would have abusy day
Hello hello he said as his mother pulled his ear to arouse himmorning mammaIts time she said after five already
Your breakfast is on thestoveHe took her hand and kissed it with great affection
He loved his motherdevotedly quite as much as he did the little tad
In their littlecottage in the forest of green hops that surrounded them on every handthe three led joyous and secluded life contented industrious happyasking nothing better
Dyke himself was bighearted jovial man whospread an atmosphere of goodhumour wherever he went
In the evenings heplayed with Sidney like big boy an older brother lying on the bedor the sofa taking her in his arms
Between them they had invented agreat game
The exengineer his boots removed his huge legs in theair hoisted the little tad on the soles of his stockinged feet like acircus acrobat dandling her there pretending he was about to lether fall
Sidney choking with delight held on nervously with littlescreams and chirps of excitement while he shifted her gingerly from onefoot to another and thence the final act the great gallery play tothe palm of one great hand
At this point Mrs Dyke was called in bothfather and daughter children both crying out that she was to come inand look look
She arrived out of breath from the kitchen the potatomasher in her hand
Such children she murmured shaking her head atthem amused for all that tucking the potato masher under her arm andclapping her hands
In the end it was part of the game that Sidneyshould tumble down upon Dyke whereat he invariably vented greatbellow as if in pain declaring that his ribs were broken
Gasping hiseyes shut he pretended to be in the extreme of dissolutionperhapshe was dying
Sidney always little uncertain amused but distressedshook him nervously tugging at his beard pushing open his eyelid withone finger imploring him not to frighten her to wake up and be good
On this occasion while yet he was halfdressed Dyke tiptoed into hismothers room to look at Sidney fast asleep in her little iron cot herarm under her head her lips parted
With infinite precaution he kissedher twice and then finding one little stocking hung with its mate veryneatly over the back of chair dropped into it dime rolled up in awad of paper
He winked all to himself and went out again closing thedoor with exaggerated carefulness
He breakfasted alone Mrs Dyke pouring his coffee and handing him hisplate of ham and eggs and half an hour later took himself off in hisspringless skeleton wagon humming tune behind his beard and crackingthe whip over the backs of his staid and solid farm horses
The morning was fine the sun just coming up
He left Guadalajarasleeping and lifeless on his left and going across lots over anangle of Quien Sabe came out upon the Upper Road mile below theLong Trestle
He was in great spirits looking about him over the brownfields ruddy with the dawn
Almost directly in front of him but faroff the gilded dome of the courthouse at Bonneville was glintingradiant in the first rays of the sun while few miles distanttoward the north the venerable campanile of the Mission San Juan stoodsilhouetted in purplish black against the flaming east
As he proceededthe great farm horses jogging forward placid deliberate the countryside waked to another day
Crossing the irrigating ditch further on hemet gang of Portuguese with picks and shovels over their shouldersjust going to work
Hooven already abroad shouted him Goot mornun from behind the fence of Los Muertos
Far off toward the southwestin the bare expanse of the open fields where clump of eucalyptusand cypress trees set dark green note thin stream of smoke rosestraight into the air from the kitchen of Derricks ranch houses
But mile or so beyond the Long Trestle he was surprised to see MagnusDerricks protege the onetime shepherd Vanamee coming across QuienSabe by trail from one of Annixters division houses
Without knowingexactly why Dyke received the impression that the young man had notbeen in bed all of that night
As the two approached each other Dyke eyed the young fellow
He wasdistrustful of Vanamee having the countrybred suspicion of any personhe could not understand
Vanamee was beyond doubt no part of the lifeof ranch and country town
He was an alien vagabond strange fellowwho came and went in mysterious fashion making no friends keepingto himself
Why did he never wear hat why indulge in fineblack pointed beard when either round beard or mustache was theinvariable custom
Why did he not cut his hair
Above all why did heprowl about so much at night
As the two passed each other Dyke forall his goodnature was little blunt in his greeting and looked backat the exshepherd over his shoulder
Dyke was right in his suspicion
Vanamees bed had not been disturbedfor three nights
On the Monday of that week he had passed the entirenight in the garden of the Mission overlooking the Seed ranch in thelittle valley
Tuesday evening had found him miles away from thatspot in deep arroyo in the Sierra foothills to the eastward whileWednesday he had slept in an abandoned dobe on Ostermans stock rangetwenty miles from his resting place of the night before
The fact of the matter was that the old restlessness had once moreseized upon Vanamee
Something began tugging at him the spur of someunseen rider touched his flank
The instinct of the wanderer woke andmoved
For some time now he had been part of the Los Muertos staff
OnQuien Sabe as on the other ranches the slack season was at hand
Whilewaiting for the wheat to come up no one was doing much of anything
Vanamee had come over to Los Muertos and spent most of his days onhorseback riding the range rounding up and watching the cattle in thefourth division of the ranch
But if the vagabond instinct now rouseditself in the strange fellows nature counter influence had also setin
More and more Vanamee frequented the Mission garden after nightfallsometimes remaining there till the dawn began to whiten lying prone onthe ground his chin on his folded arms his eyes searching the darknessover the little valley of the Seed ranch watching watching
As thedays went by he became more reticent than ever
Presley often came tofind him on the stock range lonely figure in the great wildernessof bare green hillsides but Vanamee no longer took him into hisconfidence
Father Sarria alone heard his strange stories
Dyke drove on toward Bonneville thinking over the whole matter
Heknew as every one did in that part of the country the legend ofVanamee and Angele the romance of the Mission garden the mysteryof the Other Vanamees flight to the deserts of the southwest hisperiodic returns his strange reticent solitary character but likemany another of the country people he accounted for Vanamee by shortand easy method
No doubt the fellows wits were turned
That was thelong and short of it
The exengineer reached the Post Office in Bonneville towards elevenoclock but he did not at once present his notice of the arrival ofhis consignment at Ruggless office
It entertained him to indulge in anhours lounging about the streets
It was seldom he got into town andwhen he did he permitted himself the luxury of enjoying his evidentpopularity
He met friends everywhere in the Post Office in the drugstore in the barber shop and around the courthouse
With each one heheld moments conversation almost invariably this ended in the samewayCome on have drinkWell dont care if doAnd the friends proceeded to the Yosemite bar pledging each other withpunctilious ceremony
Dyke however was strictly temperate man
His life on the engine had trained him well
Alcohol he never toucheddrinking instead ginger ale sarsaparillaandironsoft drinks
At the drug store which also kept stock of miscellaneous stationeryhis eye was caught by transparent slate childs toy where upona little pane of frosted glass one could trace with considerableelaboration outline figures of cows ploughs bunches of fruit and evenrural water mills that were printed on slips of paper underneath
Now theres an idea Jim he observed to the boy behind thesodawater fountain know little tad that would just about jump outof her skin for that
Think Ill have to take it with meHows Sidney getting along the other asked while wrapping up thepackage
Dykes enthusiasm had made of his little girl celebrity throughoutBonneville
The exengineer promptly became voluble assertive doggedly emphatic
Smartest little tad in all Tulare County and more fun
regular wholeshow in herselfAnd the hops inquired the other
Bully declared Dyke with the goodnatured mans readiness to talk ofhis private affairs to any one who would listen

That foreman of mine was daisy

Im going tomake MONEY JimHe emerged once more into the street and went up the block leisurelyplanting his feet squarely
He fancied that he could feel he wasconsidered of more importance nowadays
He was no longer subordinatean employee
He was his own man proprietor an owner of landfurthering successful enterprise
No one had helped him he hadfollowed no ones lead
He had struck out unaided for himself and hissuccess was due solely to his own intelligence industry and foresight
He squared his great shoulders till the blue gingham of his jumper allbut cracked
Of late his great blond beard had grown and the work inthe sun had made his face very red
Under the visor of his caprelic ofhis engineering dayshis blue eyes twinkled with vast goodnature
Hefelt that he made fine figure as he went by group of young girls inlawns and muslins and garden hats on their way to the Post Office
Hewondered if they looked after him wondered if they had heard that hewas in fair way to become rich man
But the chronometer in the window of the jewelry store warned him thattime was passing
He turned about and crossing the street took hisway to Ruggless office which was the freight as well as the landoffice of the and Railroad
As he stood for moment at the counter in front of the wire partitionwaiting for the clerk to make out the order for the freight agent at thedepot Dyke was surprised to see familiar figure in conference withRuggles himself by desk inside the railing
The figure was that of middleaged man fat with great stomachwhich he stroked from time to time
As he turned about addressing aremark to the clerk Dyke recognised Behrman
The banker railroadagent and political manipulator seemed to the exengineers eyes to bemore gross than ever
His smoothshaven jowl stood out big and tremulouson either side of his face the roll of fat on the nape of his necksprinkled with sparse stiff hairs bulged out with greater prominence
His great stomach covered with light brown linen vest stamped withinnumerable interlocked horseshoes protruded far in advance enormousaggressive
He wore his inevitable roundtopped hat of stiff brownstraw varnished so bright that it reflected the light of the officewindows like helmet and even from where he stood Dyke could hear hisloud breathing and the clink of the hollow links of his watch chain uponthe vest buttons of imitation pearl as his stomach rose and fell
Dyke looked at him with attention
There was the enemy therepresentative of the Trust with which Derricks League was lockinghorns
The great struggle had begun to invest the combatants withinterest
Daily almost hourly Dyke was in touch with the ranchersthe wheatgrowers
He heard their denunciations their growls ofexasperation and defiance
Here was the other sidethis placid fatman with stiff straw hat and linen vest who never lost histemper who smiled affably upon his enemies giving them good advicecommiserating with them in one defeat after another never rufflednever excited sure of his power conscious that back of him was theMachine the colossal force the inexhaustible coffers of mightyorganisation vomiting millions to the Leagues thousands
The League was clamorous ubiquitous its objects known to every urchinon the streets but the Trust was silent its ways inscrutable thepublic saw only results
It worked on in the dark calm disciplinedirresistible
Abruptly Dyke received the impression of the multitudinousramifications of the colossus
Under his feet the ground seemed mineddown there below him in the dark the huge tentacles went silentlytwisting and advancing spreading out in every direction sapping thestrength of all opposition quiet gradual biding the time to reach upand out and grip with sudden unleashing of gigantic strength
Ill be wanting some cars of you people before the summer is out observed Dyke to the clerk as he folded up and put away the order thatthe other had handed him
He remembered perfectly well that he hadarranged the matter of transporting his crop some months before buthis role of proprietor amused him and he liked to busy himself again andagain with the details of his undertaking
suppose he added youll be able to give em to me
Therell bea big wheat crop to move this year and dont want to be caught in anycar famineOh youll get your cars murmured the other
Ill be the means of bringing business your way Dyke went on Ivedone so well with my hops that there are lot of others going intothe business next season
Suppose he continued struck with anidea suppose we went into some sort of pool sort of shippersorganisation could you give us special rates cheaper ratessay centand halfThe other looked up
cent and half
Say FOUR cents and half and maybe Ill talkbusiness with youFour cents and half returned Dyke dont see it
Why theregular rate is only two centsNo it isnt answered the clerk looking him gravely in the eyeits five centsWell theres where you are wrong mson Dyke retorted genially
You look it up
Youll find the freight on hops from Bonnevilleto Frisco is two cents pound for car load lots
You told me thatyourself last fallThat was last fall observed the clerk
There was silence
Dyke shota glance of suspicion at the other
Then reassured he remarkedYou look it up
Youll see Im rightS Behrman came forward and shook hands politely with the exengineer
Anything can do for you Mr DykeDyke explained
When he had done speaking the clerk turned to SBehrman and observed respectfullyOur regular rate on hops is five centsYes answered Behrman pausing to reflect yes Mr Dyke thatsrightfive centsThe clerk brought forward folder of yellow paper and handed itto Dyke
It was inscribed at the top Tariff Schedule No
andunderneath these words in brackets was smaller inscriptionSUPERSEDES NO
OF AUG See for yourself said Behrman
He indicated an item under the headof MiscellanyThe following rates for carriage of hops in car load lots read Dyketake effect June and will remain in force until superseded by alater tariff
Those quoted beyond Stockton are subject to changes intraffic arrangements with carriers by water from that pointIn the list that was printed below Dyke saw that the rate for hopsbetween Bonneville or Guadalajara and San Francisco was five cents
For moment Dyke was confused
Then swiftly the matter became clear inhis mind
The Railroad had raised the freight on hops from two cents tofive
All his calculations as to profit on his little investment he hadbased on freight rate of two cents pound
He was under contract todeliver his crop
He could not draw back
The new rate ate up every centof his gains
He stood there ruined
Why what do you mean he burst out
You promised me rate of twocents and went ahead with my business with that understanding
What doyou meanS Behrman and the clerk watched him from the other side of the counter
The rate is five cents declared the clerk doggedly
Well that ruins me shouted Dyke
Do you understand
wont makefifty cents
Why will OWEIll bebeThat ruins me do youunderstandThe other raised shoulder
We dont force you to ship
You can do as you like
The rate is fivecentsWellbutdamn you Im under contract to deliver
What am going todo
Why you told meyou promised me twocent rateI dont remember it said the clerk
dont know anything aboutthat
But know this know that hops have gone up
know the Germancrop was failure and that the crop in New York wasnt worth thehauling
Hops have gone up to nearly dollar
You dont suppose wedont know that do you Mr DykeWhats the price of hops got to do with youIts got THIS to do with us returned the other with suddenaggressiveness that the freight rate has gone up to meet the price
Were not doing business for our health
My orders are to raise yourrate to five cents and think you are getting off easyDyke stared in blank astonishment
For the moment the audacity ofthe affair was what most appealed to him
He forgot its personalapplication
Good Lord he murmured good Lord
What will you people do next
Whats your basis of applying freight rates anyhow he suddenlyvociferated with furious sarcasm
Whats your rule
What are you guidedbyBut at the words Behrman who had kept silent during the heat of thediscussion leaned abruptly forward
For the only time in his knowledgeDyke saw his face inflamed with anger and with the enmity and contemptof all this farming element with whom he was contending
Yes whats your rule
Whats your basis demanded Dyke turningswiftly to him
Behrman emphasised each word of his reply with tap of oneforefinger on the counter before himAllthetrafficwillbearThe exengineer stepped back pace his fingers on the ledge of thecounter to steady himself
He felt himself grow pale his heart becamea mere leaden weight in his chest inert refusing to beat
In second the whole affair in all its bearings went speeding beforethe eye of his imagination like the rapid unrolling of panorama
Everycent of his earnings was sunk in this hop business of his
More thanthat he had borrowed money to carry it on certain of successborrowedof Behrman offering his crop and his little home as security
Oncehe failed to meet his obligations Behrman would foreclose
Not onlywould the Railroad devour every morsel of his profits but also it wouldtake from him his home at blow he would be left penniless and withouta home
What would then become of his motherand what would becomeof the little tad
She whom he had been planning to educate like averitable lady
For all that year he had talked of his ambition for hislittle daughter to every one he met
All Bonneville knew of it
Whata mark for gibes he had made of himself
The workingman turned farmer
What target for jeershe who had fancied he could elude the Railroad
He remembered he had once said the great Trust had overlooked his littleenterprise disdaining to plunder such small fry
He should have knownbetter than that
How had he ever imagined the Road would permit him tomake any money
Anger was not in him yet no rousing of the blind whitehot wrath thatleaps to the attack with prehensile fingers moved him
The blow merelycrushed staggered confused
He stepped aside to give place to coatless man in pink shirt whoentered carrying in his hands an automatic doorclosing apparatus
Where does this go inquired the man
Dyke sat down for moment on seat that had been removed from awornout railway car to do duty in Ruggless office
On the back of ayellow envelope he made some vague figures with stump of blue pencilmultiplying subtracting perplexing himself with many errors
Behrman the clerk and the man with the doorclosing apparatusinvolved themselves in long argument gazing intently at the top panelof the door
The man who had come to fix the apparatus was unwilling toguarantee it unless sign was put on the outside of the door warningincomers that the door was selfclosing
This sign would cost fifteencents extra
But you didnt say anything about this when the thing was ordered declared Behrman
No wont pay it my friend
Its anoverchargeYou neednt think observed the clerk that just because you aredealing with the Railroad you are going to work usGenslinger came in accompanied by Delaney
Behrman and theclerk abruptly dismissing the man with the doorclosing machine putthemselves behind the counter and engaged in conversation with thesetwo
Genslinger introduced Delaney
The buster had string of horses hewas shipping southward
No doubt he had come to make arrangements withthe Railroad in the matter of stock cars
The conference of the four menwas amicable in the extreme
Dyke studying the figures on the back of the envelope came forwardagain
Absorbed only in his own distress he ignored the editor and thecowpuncher
Say he hazarded how about this
make outWeve told you what our rates are Mr Dyke exclaimed the clerkangrily
Thats all the arrangement we will make
Take it or leave it He turned again to Genslinger giving the exengineer his back
Dyke moved away and stood for moment in the centre of the roomstaring at the figures on the envelope
dont see he muttered just what Im going to do
No dont seewhat Im going to do at allRuggles came in bringing with him two other men in whom Dyke recogniseddummy buyers of the Los Muertos and Osterman ranchos
They brushed byhim jostling his elbow and as he went out of the door he heard themexchange jovial greetings with Delaney Genslinger and Behrman
Dyke went down the stairs to the street and proceeded onward aimlesslyin the direction of the Yosemite House fingering the yellow envelopeand looking vacantly at the sidewalk
There was stoop to his massive shoulders
His great arms dangledloosely at his sides the palms of his hands open
As he went along certain feeling of shame touched him
Surely hispredicament must be apparent to every passerby
No doubt every onerecognised the unsuccessful man in the very way he slouched along
Theyoung girls in lawns muslins and garden hats returning from the PostOffice their hands full of letters must surely see in him the type ofthe failure the bankrupt
Then brusquely his tardy rage flamed up
By God NO it was not hisfault he had made no mistake
His energy industry and foresight hadbeen sound
He had been merely the object of colossal trick sordidinjustice victim of the insatiate greed of the monster caught andchoked by one of those millions of tentacles suddenly reaching up frombelow from out the dark beneath his feet coiling around his throatthrottling him strangling him sucking his blood
For moment hethought of the courts but instantly laughed at the idea
What court wasimmune from the power of the monster
Ah the rage of helplessness thefury of impotence
No help no hoperuined in brief instanthe averitable giant built of great sinews powerful in the full tide ofhis manhood having all his health all his wits
How could he nowface his home
How could he tell his mother of this catastrophe
And Sidneythe little tad how could he explain to her thiswretchednesshow soften her disappointment
How keep the tears fromout her eyeshow keep alive her confidence in himher faith in hisresources
Bitter fierce ominous his wrath loomed up in his heart
His fistsgripped tight together his teeth clenched
Oh for moment to havehis hand upon the throat of Behrman wringing the breath from himwrenching out the red life of himstaining the street with the bloodsucked from the veins of the People
To the first friend that he met Dyke told the tale of the tragedyand to the next and to the next
The affair went from mouth to mouthspreading with electrical swiftness overpassing and running ahead ofDyke himself so that by the time he reached the lobby of the YosemiteHouse he found his story awaiting him
group formed about him
Inhis immediate vicinity business for the instant was suspended
The groupswelled
One after another of his friends added themselves to it
MagnusDerrick joined it and Annixter
Again and again Dyke recounted thematter beginning with the time when he was discharged from the samecorporations service for refusing to accept an unfair wage
His voicequivered with exasperation his heavy frame shook with rage his eyeswere injected bloodshot his face flamed vermilion while his deepbass rumbled throughout the running comments of his auditors like thethunderous reverberation of diapason
From all points of view the story was discussed by those who listenedto him now in the heat of excitement now calmly judicially
Oneverdict however prevailed
It was voiced by Annixter Youre stuck
You can roar till youre black in the face but you cant buck againstthe Railroad
Theres nothing to be done You can shoot the ruffianyou can shoot Behrman clamoured one of the group
Yes sir by theLord you can shoot himPoor fool commented Annixter turning away
Nothing to be done
No there was nothing to be donenot one thing
Dyke at last alone and driving his team out of the town turnedthe business confusedly over in his mind from end to end
Advicesuggestion even offers of financial aid had been showered upon him fromall directions
Friends were not wanting who heatedly presented to hisconsideration all manner of ingenious plans wonderful devices
Theywere worthless
The tentacle held fast
He was stuck
By degrees as his wagon carried him farther out into the country andopen empty fields his anger lapsed and the numbness of bewildermentreturned
He could not look one hour ahead into the future couldformulate no plans even for the next day
He did not know what to do
Hewas stuck
With the limpness and inertia of sack of sand the reins slippingloosely in his dangling fingers his eyes fixed staring between thehorses heads he allowed himself to be carried aimlessly along
Heresigned himself
What did he care
What was the use of going on
He wasstuck
The team he was driving had once belonged to the Los Muertos stables andunguided as the horses were they took the county road towards Derricksranch house
Dyke all abroad was unaware of the fact till drawnby the smell of water the horses halted by the trough in front ofCarahers saloon
The exengineer dismounted looking about him realising where he was
So much the worse it did not matter
Now that he had come so far it wasas short to go home by this route as to return on his tracks
Slowly heunchecked the horses and stood at their heads watching them drink
dont see he muttered just what am going to doCaraher appeared at the door of his place his red face red beard andflaming cravat standing sharply out from the shadow of the doorway
Hecalled welcome to Dyke
Hello CaptainDyke looked up nodding his head listlessly
Hello Caraher he answered
Well continued the saloonkeeper coming forward step whats thenews in townDyke told him
Carahers red face suddenly took on darker colour
Thered glint in his eyes shot from under his eyebrows
Furious he vented arolling explosion of oaths
And now its your turn he vociferated
They aint after only the bigwheatgrowers the rich men
By God theyll even pick the poor manspocket
Oh theyll get their bellies full some day
It cant lastforever
Theyll wake up the wrong kind of man some morning the manthats got guts in him that will hit back when hes kicked and thatwill talk to em with torch in one hand and stick of dynamite in theother He raised his clenched fists in the air
So help me God he cried when think it all over go crazy see red
Oh if thepeople only knew their strength
Oh if could wake em up
Theres notonly Shelgrim but theres others
All the magnates all the butchersall the bloodsuckers by the thousands
Their day will come by God itwillBy now the exengineer and the barkeeper had retired to the saloonback of the grocery to talk over the details of this new outrage
Dykestill little dazed sat down by one of the tables preoccupied sayingbut little and Caraher as matter of course set the whiskey bottle athis elbow
It happened that at this same moment Presley returning to Los Muertosfrom Bonneville his pockets full of mail stopped in at the grocery tobuy some black lead for his bicycle
In the saloon on the other sideof the narrow partition he overheard the conversation between Dyke andCaraher
The door was open
He caught every word distinctly
Tell us all about it Dyke urged Caraher
For the fiftieth time Dyke told the story
Already it had crystallisedinto certain form
He used the same phrases with each repetition thesame sentences the same words
In his mind it became set
Thus he wouldtell it to any one who would listen from now on week after week yearafter year all the rest of his lifeAnd based my calculations on atwocent rate
So soon as they saw was to make money they doubledthe tariffall the traffic would bearand mortgaged to SBehrmanruined me with turn of the handstuck cinched and not onething to be doneAs he talked he drank glass after glass of whiskey and the honestrage the open aboveboard fury of his mind coagulated thickened andsunk to dull evil hatred wicked oblique malevolence
Carahersure now of winning disciple replenished his glass
Do you blame us now he cried us others the Reds
Ah yes itsall very well for your middle class to preach moderation
could do ittoo
You could do it too if your belly was fed if your propertywas safe if your wife had not been murdered if your children were notstarving
Easy enough then to preach lawabiding methods legal redressand all such rot
But how about US he vociferated
Ah yes Im aloudmouthed rumseller aint
Im wildeyed striker aint
Im bloodthirsty anarchist aint
Wait till youve seen yourwife brought home to you with the face you used to kiss smashed in by ahorses hoofkilled by the Trust as it happened to me
Then talk aboutmoderation
And you Dyke blacklisted engineer discharged employeeruined agriculturist wait till you see your little tad and your motherturned out of doors when Behrman forecloses
Wait till you see emgetting thin and white and till you hear your little girl ask you whyyou all dont eat little more and that she wants her dinner and youcant give it to her
Wait till you seeat the same time thatyour family is dying for lack of breada hundred thousand acres ofwheatmillions of bushels of foodgrabbed and gobbled by the RailroadTrust and then talk of moderation
That talk is just what the Trustwants to hear
It aint frightened of that
Theres one thing only itdoes listen to one thing it is frightened ofthe people with dynamitein their handssix inches of plugged gaspipe
THAT talksDyke did not reply
He filled another pony of whiskey and drank it intwo gulps
His frown had lowered to scowl his face was dark redhis head had sunk bulllike between his massive shoulders withoutwinking he gazed long and with troubled eyes at his knotted muscularhands lying open on the table before him idle their occupation gone
Presley forgot his black lead
He listened to Caraher
Through the opendoor he caught glimpse of Dykes back broad muscled bowed down thegreat shoulders stooping
The whole drama of the doubled freight rate leaped salient and distinctin the eye of his mind
And this was but one instance an isolated case
Because he was near at hand he happened to see it
How many others werethere the length and breadth of the State
Constantly this sort ofthing must occurlittle industries choked out in their very beginningsthe air full of the death rattles of little enterprises expiringunobserved in faroff counties up in canyons and arroyos of thefoothills forgotten by every one but the monster who was daunted by themagnitude of no business however great who overlooked no opportunityof plunder however petty who with one tentacle grabbed hundredthousand acres of wheat and with another pilfered pocketful ofgrowing hops
He went away without word his head bent his hands clutched tightlyon the cork grips of the handle bars of his bicycle
His lips werewhite
In his heart blind demon of revolt raged tumultuous shriekingblasphemies
At Los Muertos Presley overtook Annixter
As he guided his wheel up thedriveway to Derricks ranch house he saw the master of Quien Sabe andHarran in conversation on the steps of the porch
Magnus stood in thedoorway talking to his wife
Occupied with the press of business and involved in the final conferencewith the Leagues lawyers on the eve of the latters departure forWashington Annixter had missed the train that was to take him back toGuadalajara and Quien Sabe
Accordingly he had accepted the Governorsinvitation to return with him on his buckboard to Los Muertos andbefore leaving Bonneville had telephoned to his ranch to have youngVacca bring the buckskin by way of the Lower Road to meet him atLos Muertos
He found her waiting there for him but before going ondelayed few moments to tell Harran of Dykes affair
wonder what he will do now observed Harran when his first outburstof indignation had subsided
Nothing declared Annixter
Hes stuckThat eats up every cent of Dykes earnings Harran went on
He hasbeen ten years saving them
Oh told him to make sure of the Railroadwhen he first spoke to me about growing hopsIve just seen him said Presley as he joined the others
He was atCarahers
only saw his back
He was drinking at table and his backwas towards me
But the man looked brokenabsolutely crushed
It isterrible terribleHe was at Carahers was he demanded Annixter
YesDrinking heyI think so
Yes saw bottleDrinking at Carahers exclaimed Annixter rancorously can see HISfinishThere was silence
It seemed as if nothing more was to be said
Theypaused looking thoughtfully on the ground
In silence grim bitter infinitely sad the three men as if at thatmoment actually standing in the barroom of Carahers roadside salooncontemplated the slow sinking the inevitable collapse and submergingof one of their companions the wreck of career the ruin of anindividual an honest man strong fearless upright struck down by acolossal power perverted by an evil influence go reeling to his ruin
see his finish repeated Annixter
Exit Dyke and score anothertally for Behrman Shelgrim and CoHe moved away impatiently loosening the tierope with which thebuckskin was fastened
He swung himself up
God for us all he declared as he rode away and the devil take thehindmost
Goodbye Im going home
still have one little longerHe galloped away along the Lower Road in the direction of Quien Sabeemerging from the grove of cypress and eucalyptus about the ranch houseand coming out upon the bare brown plain of the wheat land stretchingaway from him in apparent barrenness on either hand
It was late in the day already his shadow was long upon the padded dustof the road in front of him
On ahead long ways off and little tothe north the venerable campanile of the Mission San Juan was glintingradiant in the last rays of the sun while behind him towards thenorth and west the gilded dome of the courthouse at Bonneville stoodsilhouetted in purplish black against the flaming west
Annixter spurredthe buckskin forward
He feared he might be late to his supper
Hewondered if it would be brought to him by Hilma
The name struck across in his brain with pleasant glowingtremour
All through that day of activity of strenuous business theminute and cautious planning of the final campaign in the great war ofthe League and the Trust the idea of her and the recollection of herhad been the undercurrent of his thoughts
At last he was alone
Hecould put all other things behind him and occupy himself solely withher
In that glory of the days end in that chaos of sunshine he saw heragain
Unimaginative crude direct his fancy nevertheless placedher before him steeped in sunshine saturated with glorious lightbrilliant radiant alluring
He saw the sweet simplicity of hercarriage the statuesque evenness of the contours of her figure thesingle deep swell of her bosom the solid masses of her hair
Heremembered the small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintiness hehad so often remarked about her her slim narrow feet the little steelbuckles of her low shoes the knot of black ribbon she had begun to wearof late on the back of her head and he heard her voice lowpitchedvelvety sweet murmuring huskiness that seemed to come more from herchest than from her throat
The buckskins hoofs clattered upon the gravelly flats of BrodersonsCreek underneath the Long Trestle
Annixters mind went back to thescene of the previous evening when he had come upon her at this place
He set his teeth with anger and disappointment
Why had she not beenable to understand
What was the matter with these women always setupon this marrying notion
Was it not enough that he wanted her morethan any other girl he knew and that she wanted him
She had said asmuch
Did she think she was going to be mistress of Quien Sabe
Ah thatwas it
She was after his property was for marrying him because of hismoney
His unconquerable suspicion of the woman his innate distrustof the feminine element would not be done away with
What fathomlessduplicity was hers that she could appear so innocent
It was almostunbelievable in fact was it believable
For the first time doubt assailed him
Suppose Hilma was indeed allthat she appeared to be
Suppose it was not with her question of hisproperty after all it was poor time to think of marrying him for hisproperty when all Quien Sabe hung in the issue of the next few months
Suppose she had been sincere
But he caught himself up
Was he to befooled by feemale girl at this late date
He Buck Annixter craftyhardheaded man of affairs
Not much
Whatever transpired he wouldremain the master
He reached Quien Sabe in this frame of mind
But at this hour Annixterfor all his resolutions could no longer control his thoughts
As hestripped the saddle from the buckskin and led her to the watering troughby the stable corral his heart was beating thick at the very notionof being near Hilma again
It was growing dark but covertly he glancedhere and there out of the corners of his eyes to see if she was anywhereabout
Annixterhow he could not tellhad become possessed of theidea that Hilma would not inform her parents of what had passed betweenthem the previous evening under the Long Trestle
He had no idea thatmatters were at an end between himself and the young woman
He mustapologise he saw that clearly enough must eat crow as he toldhimself
Well he would eat crow
He was not afraid of her any longernow that she had made her confession to him
He would see her as soon aspossible and get this business straightened out and begin again from anew starting point
What he wanted with Hilma Annixter did not defineclearly in his mind
At one time he had known perfectly well what hewanted
Now the goal of his desires had become vague
He could not sayexactly what it was
He preferred that things should go forward withoutmuch idea of consequences if consequences came they would do sonaturally enough and of themselves all that he positively knew wasthat Hilma occupied his thoughts morning noon and night that he washappy when he was with her and miserable when away from her
The Chinese cook served his supper in silence
Annixter ate and drankand lighted cigar and after his meal sat on the porch of his housesmoking and enjoying the twilight
The evening was beautiful warm thesky one powder of stars
From the direction of the stables he heard oneof the Portuguese hands picking guitar
But he wanted to see Hilma
The idea of going to bed without at least aglimpse of her became distasteful to him
Annixter got up and descendingfrom the porch began to walk aimlessly about between the ranchbuildings with eye and ear alert
Possibly he might meet hersomewheres
The Trees little house toward which inevitably Annixter directedhis steps was dark
Had they all gone to bed so soon
He made awide circuit about it listening but heard no sound
The door of thedairyhouse stood ajar
He pushed it open and stepped into the odorousdarkness of its interior
The pans and deep cans of polished metalglowed faintly from the corners and from the walls
The smell of newcheese was pungent in his nostrils
Everything was quiet
There wasnobody there
He went out again closing the door and stood for amoment in the space between the dairyhouse and the new barn uncertainas to what he should do next
As he waited there his foreman came out of the mens bunk house on theother side of the kitchens and crossed over toward the barn
HelloBilly muttered Annixter as he passed
Oh good evening Mr Annixter said the other pausing in front ofhim
didnt know you were back
By the way he added speaking asthough the matter was already known to Annixter see old man Tree andhis family have left us
Are they going to be gone long
Have they leftfor goodWhats that Annixter exclaimed
When did they go
Did all of themgo all threeWhy thought you knew
Sure they all left on the afternoon train forSan Francisco
Cleared out in hurrytook all their trunks
Yes allthree wentthe young lady too
They gave me notice early this morning
They aint ought to have done that
dont know who Im to get to runthe dairy on such short notice
Do you know any one Mr AnnixterWell why in hell did you let them go vociferated Annixter
Whydidnt you keep them here till got back
Why didnt you find out ifthey were going for good
cant be everywhere
What do feed you forif it aint to look after things cant attend toHe turned on his heel and strode away straight before him not caringwhere he was going
He tramped out from the group of ranch buildingsholding on over the open reach of his ranch his teeth set his heelsdigging furiously into the ground
The minutes passed
He walked onswiftly muttering to himself from time to time
Gone by the Lord
Gone by the Lord
By the Lord Harry shes clearedoutAs yet his head was empty of all thought
He could not steady his witsto consider this new turn of affairs
He did not even try
Gone by the Lord he exclaimed
By the Lord shes cleared outHe found the irrigating ditch and the beaten path made by the ditchtenders that bordered it and followed it some five minutes then struckoff at right angles over the rugged surface of the ranch land to wherea great white stone jutted from the ground
There he sat down andleaning forward rested his elbows on his knees and looked out vaguelyinto the night his thoughts swiftly readjusting themselves
He was alone
The silence of the night the infinite repose of theflat bare earthtwo immensitieswidened around and above him likeillimitable seas
grey halflight mysterious grave flooded downwardfrom the stars
Annixter was in torment
Now there could be no longer any doubtnow itwas Hilma or nothing
Once out of his reach once lost to him and therecollection of her assailed him with unconquerable vehemence
Much asshe had occupied his mind he had never realised till now how vast hadbeen the place she had filled in his life
He had told her as much buteven then he did not believe it
Suddenly bitter rage against himself overwhelmed him as he thought ofthe hurt he had given her the previous evening
He should have manageddifferently
How he did not know but the sense of the outrage he hadput upon her abruptly recoiled against him with cruel force
Now he wassorry for it infinitely sorry passionately sorry
He had hurt her
He had brought the tears to her eyes
He had so flagrantly insulted herthat she could no longer bear to breathe the same air with him
She hadtold her parents all
She had left Quien Sabehad left him for goodat the very moment when he believed he had won her
Brute beast that hewas he had driven her away
An hour went by then two then four then six
Annixter still sat inhis place groping and battling in confusion of spirit the like ofwhich he had never felt before
He did not know what was the matter withhim
He could not find his way out of the dark and out of the turmoilthat wheeled around him
He had had no experience with women
There wasno precedent to guide him
How was he to get out of this
What was theclew that would set everything straight again
That he would give Hilma up never once entered his head
Have her hewould
She had given herself to him
Everything should have been easyafter that and instead here he was alone in the night wrestling withhimself in deeper trouble than ever and Hilma farther than ever awayfrom him
It was true he might have Hilma even now if he was willing to marryher
But marriage to his mind had been always vague most remotepossibility almost as vague and as remote as his deatha thing thathappened to some men but that would surely never occur to him or ifit did it would be after long years had passed when he was older moresettled more maturean event that belonged to the period of his middlelife distant as yet
He had never faced the question of his marriage
He had kept it at animmense distance from him
It had never been part of his order ofthings
He was not marrying man
But Hilma was an everpresent reality as near to him as his right hand
Marriage was formless far distant abstraction
Hilma tangibleimminent fact
Before he could think of the two as one before he couldconsider the idea of marriage side by side with the idea of Hilmameasureless distances had to be traversed things as disassociated inhis mind as fire and water had to be fused together and between thetwo he was torn as if upon rack
Slowly by imperceptible degrees the imagination unused unwillingmachine began to work
The brains activity lapsed proportionately
He began to think less and feel more
In that rugged compositionconfused dark harsh furrow had been driven deep little seedplanted little seed at first weak forgotten lost in the lower darkplaces of his character
But as the intellect moved slower its functions growing numb theidea of self dwindled
Annixter no longer considered himself no longerconsidered the notion of marriage from the point of view of his owncomfort his own wishes his own advantage
He realised that in hisnewfound desire to make her happy he was sincere
There was somethingin that idea after all
To make some one happyhow about that now
Itwas worth thinking of
Far away low down in the east dim belt grey light began to whitenover the horizon
The tower of the Mission stood black against it
Thedawn was coming
The baffling obscurity of the night was passing
Hiddenthings were coming into view
Annixter his eyes halfclosed his chin upon his fist allowed hisimagination full play
How would it be if he should take Hilma intohis life this beautiful young girl pure as he now knew her to beinnocent noble with the inborn nobility of dawning womanhood
Anoverwhelming sense of his own unworthiness suddenly bore down upon himwith crushing force as he thought of this
He had gone about thewhole affair wrongly
He had been mistaken from the very first
She wasinfinitely above him
He did not wanthe should not desire to be themaster
It was she his servant poor simple lowly even who shouldcondescend to him
Abruptly there was presented to his minds eye picture of the years tocome if he now should follow his best his highest his most unselfishimpulse
He saw Hilma his own for better or for worse for richer orfor poorer all barriers down between them he giving himself to her asfreely as nobly as she had given herself to him
By supreme effortnot of the will but of the emotion he fought his way across thatvast gulf that for time had gaped between Hilma and the idea of hismarriage
Instantly like the swift blending of beautiful colours likethe harmony of beautiful chords of music the two ideas melted into oneand in that moment into his harsh unlovely world new idea was born
Annixter stood suddenly upright mighty tenderness gentlenessof spirit such as he had never conceived of in his heart strainedswelled and in moment seemed to burst
Out of the dark furrows ofhis soul up from the deep rugged recesses of his being something roseexpanding
He opened his arms wide
An immense happiness overpoweredhim
Actual tears came to his eyes
Without knowing why he was notashamed of it
This poor crude fellow harsh hard narrow with hisunlovely nature his fierce truculency his selfishness his obstinacyabruptly knew that all the sweetness of life all the great vivifyingeternal force of humanity had burst into life within him
The little seed long since planted gathering strength quietly had atlast germinated
Then as the realisation of this hardened into certainty in the growinglight of the new day that had just dawned for him Annixter uttered acry
Now at length he knew the meaning of it all
WhyII LOVE her he cried
Never until then had it occurred tohim
Never until then in all his thoughts of Hilma had that great wordpassed his lips
It was Memnonian cry the greeting of the hard harsh image of manroughhewn flinty granitic uttering note of joy acclaiming the newrisen sun
By now it was almost day
The east glowed opalescent
All about himAnnixter saw the land inundated with light
But there was change
Overnight something had occurred
In his perturbation the change seemedto him at first elusive almost fanciful unreal
But now as the lightspread he looked again at the gigantic scroll of ranch lands unrolledbefore him from edge to edge of the horizon
The change was notfanciful
The change was real
The earth was no longer bare
The landwas no longer barrenno longer empty no longer dull brown
All atonce Annixter shouted aloud
There it was the Wheat the Wheat
The little seed long plantedgerminating in the deep dark furrows of the soil straining swellingsuddenly in one night had burst upward to the light
The wheat hadcome up
It was there before him around him everywhere illimitableimmeasurable
The winter brownness of the ground was overlaid with alittle shimmer of green
The promise of the sowing was being fulfilled
The earth the loyal mother who never failed who never disappointedwas keeping her faith again
Once more the strength of nations wasrenewed
Once more the force of the world was revivified
Once morethe Titan benignant calm stirred and woke and the morning abruptlyblazed into glory upon the spectacle of man whose heart leapedexuberant with the love of woman and an exulting earth gleamingtranscendent with the radiant magnificence of an inviolable pledge
CHAPTER IIIPresleys room in the ranch house of Los Muertos was in the second storyof the building
It was corner room one of its windows facing thesouth the other the east
Its appointments were of the simplest
Inone angle was the small white painted iron bed covered with whitecounterpane
The walls were hung with white paper figured with knotsof pale green leaves very gay and bright
There was straw mattingon the floor
White muslin halfcurtains hung in the windows uponthe sills of which certain plants bearing pink waxen flowers of whichPresley did not know the name grew in oblong green boxes
The wallswere unadorned save by two pictures one reproduction of the Readingfrom Homer the other charcoal drawing of the Mission of San Juan deGuadalajara which Presley had made himself
By the east window stoodthe plainest of deal tables innocent of any cloth or covering such asmight have been used in kitchen
It was Presleys work table and wasinvariably littered with papers halffinished manuscripts drafts ofpoems notebooks pens halfsmoked cigarettes and the like
Near athand upon shelf were his books
There were but two chairs in theroomthe straight backed wooden chair that stood in front of thetable angular upright and in which it was impossible to take onesease and the long comfortable wicker steamer chair stretching itslength in front of the south window
Presley was immensely fond ofthis room
It amused and interested him to maintain its air of rigoroussimplicity and freshness
He abhorred cluttered bricabrac andmeaningless objets dart
Once in so often he submitted his room to avigorous inspection setting it to rights removing everything but theessentials the few ornaments which in way were part of his life
His writing had by this time undergone complete change
The notes forhis great Song of the West the epic poem he once had hoped to writehe had flung aside together with all the abortive attempts at itsbeginning
Also he had torn up great quantity of fugitive versespreserving only certain halffinished poem that he called TheToilers This poem was comment upon the social fabric and had beeninspired by the sight of painting he had seen in Cedarquists artgallery
He had written all but the last verse
On the day that he had overheard the conversation between Dyke andCaraher in the latters saloon which had acquainted him with themonstrous injustice of the increased tariff Presley had returned to LosMuertos white and trembling roused to pitch of exaltation the likeof which he had never known in all his life
His wrath was little shortof even Carahers
He too saw red mighty spirit of revolt heavedtumultuous within him
It did not seem possible that this outrage couldgo on much longer
The oppression was incredible the plain story ofit set down in truthful statement of fact would not be believed by theoutside world
He went up to his little room and paced the floor with clenched fistsand burning face till at last the repression of his contendingthoughts all but suffocated him and he flung himself before his tableand began to write
For time his pen seemed to travel of itselfwords came to him without searching shaping themselves intophrasesthe phrases building themselves up to great forciblesentences full of eloquence of fire of passion
As his prose grewmore exalted it passed easily into the domain of poetry
Soon thecadence of his paragraphs settled to an ordered beat and rhythm and inthe end Presley had thrust aside his journal and was once more writingverse
He picked up his incomplete poem of The Toilers read it hastily acouple of times to catch its swing then the Idea of the last versetheIdea for which he so long had sought in vainabruptly springing to hisbrain wrote it off without so much as replenishing his pen with ink
He added still another verse bringing the poem to definite closeresuming its entire conception and ending with single majesticthought simple noble dignified absolutely convincing
Presley laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair with thecertainty that for one moment he had touched untrod heights
His handswere cold his head on fire his heart leaping tumultuous in his breast
Now at last he had achieved
He saw why he had never grasped theinspiration for his vast vague IMPERSONAL Song of the West
At thetime when he sought for it his convictions had not been aroused hehad not then cared for the People
His sympathies had not been touched
Small wonder that he had missed it
Now he was of the People he hadbeen stirred to his lowest depths
His earnestness was almost frenzy
He BELIEVED and so to him all things were possible at once
Then the artist in him reasserted itself
He became more interested inhis poem as such than in the cause that had inspired it
He went overit again retouching it carefully changing word here and there andimproving its rhythm
For the moment he forgot the People forgot hisrage his agitation of the previous hour he remembered only that he hadwritten great poem
Then doubt intruded
After all was it so great
Did not its sublimityoverpass little the bounds of the ridiculous
Had he seen true
Had hefailed again
He reread the poem carefully and it seemed all at onceto lose force
By now Presley could not tell whether what he had written was truepoetry or doggerel
He distrusted profoundly his own judgment
He musthave the opinion of some one else some one competent to judge
He couldnot wait tomorrow would not do
He must know to certainty before hecould rest that night
He made careful copy of what he had written and putting on his hatand laced boots went down stairs and out upon the lawn crossing overto the stables
He found Phelps there washing down the buckboard
Do you know where Vanamee is today he asked the latter
Phelps puthis chin in the air
Ask me something easy he responded
He might be at Guadalajara orhe might be up at Ostermans or he might be hundred miles away fromeither place
know where he ought to be Mr Presley but that aintsaying where the crazy gesabe is
He OUGHT to be rangeriding over eastof Four at the head waters of Mission CreekIll try for him there at all events answered Presley
If you seeHarran when he comes in tell him may not be back in time for supperPresley found the pony in the corral cinched the saddle upon him andwent off over the Lower Road going eastward at brisk canter
At Hoovens he called How do you do to Minna whom he saw lying in aslat hammock under the mammoth live oak her foot in bandages andthen galloped on over the bridge across the irrigating ditch wonderingvaguely what would become of such pretty girl as Minna and if inthe end she would marry the Portuguese foreman in charge of theditchinggang
He told himself that he hoped she would and thatspeedily
There was no lack of comment as to Minna Hooven about theranches
Certainly she was good girl but she was seen at all hourshere and there about Bonneville and Guadalajara skylarking with thePortuguese farm hands of Quien Sabe and Los Muertos
She was verypretty the men made fools of themselves over her
Presley hoped theywould not end by making fool of her
Just beyond the irrigating ditch Presley left the Lower Road andfollowing trail that branched off southeasterly from this point heldon across the Fourth Division of the ranch keeping the Mission Creekon his left
few miles farther on he went through gate in barbedwire fence and at once engaged himself in system of little arroyosand low rolling hills that steadily lifted and increased in size ashe proceeded
This higher ground was the advance guard of the Sierrafoothills and served as the stock range for Los Muertos
The hills werehuge rolling hummocks of bare ground covered only by wild oats
Atlong intervals were isolated live oaks
In the canyons and arroyos thechaparral and manzanita grew in dark olivegreen thickets
The groundwas honeycombed with gopherholes and the gophers themselves wereeverywhere
Occasionally jack rabbit bounded across the open from onegrowth of chaparral to another taking long leaps his ears erect
Highoverhead hawk or two swung at anchor and once with startling rushof wings covey of quail flushed from the brush at the side of thetrail
On the hillsides in thinly scattered groups were the cattle grazingdeliberately working slowly toward the waterholes for their eveningdrink the horses keeping to themselves the colts nuzzling at theirmothers bellies whisking their tails stamping their unshod feet
Butonce in remoter field solitary magnificent enormous the short haircurling tight upon his forehead his small red eyes twinkling his vastneck heavy with muscles Presley came upon the monarch the kingthe great Durham bull maintaining his lonely state unapproachableaustere
Presley found the onetime shepherd by waterhole in far distantcorner of the range
He had made his simple camp for the night
Hisbluegrey army blanket lay spread under live oak his horse grazednear at hand
He himself sat on his heels before little fire ofdead manzanita roots cooking his coffee and bacon
Never had Presleyconceived so keen an impression of loneliness as his crouching figurepresented
The bald bare landscape widened about him to infinity
Vanamee was spot in it all tiny dot single atom of humanorganisation floating endlessly on the ocean of an illimitable nature
The two friends ate together and Vanamee having snared brace ofquails dressed and then roasted them on sharpened stick
Aftereating they drank great refreshing draughts from the waterhole
Thenat length Presley having lit his cigarette and Vanamee his pipe theformer saidVanamee have been writing againVanamee turned his lean ascetic face toward him his black eyes fixedattentively
know he said your journalNo this is poem
You remember told you about it once
TheToilers called itOh verse
Well am glad you have gone back to it
It is your naturalvehicleYou remember the poem asked Presley
It was unfinishedYes remember it
There was better promise in it than anything youever wrote
Now suppose you have finished itWithout reply Presley brought it from out the breast pocket of hisshooting coat
The moment seemed propitious
The stillness of the vastbare hills was profound
The sun was setting in cloudless brazier ofred light golden dust pervaded all the landscape
Presley read hispoem aloud
When he had finished his friend looked at him
What have you been doing lately he demanded
Presley wondering toldof his various comings and goings
dont mean that returned the other
Something has happened to yousomething has aroused you
am right am not
Yes thought so
Inthis poem of yours you have not been trying to make sounding piece ofliterature
You wrote it under tremendous stress
Its very imperfectionsshow that
It is better than mere rhyme
It is an UtteranceaMessage
It is Truth
You have come back to the primal heart of thingsand you have seen clearly
Yes it is great poemThank you exclaimed Presley fervidly
had begun to mistrustmyselfNow observed Vanamee presume you will rush it into print
To haveformulated great thought simply to have accomplished is not enoughI think am sincere objected Presley
If it is good it will do goodto others
You said yourself it was Message
If it has any value donot think it would be right to keep it back from even very small andmost indifferent publicDont publish it in the magazines at all events Vanamee answered
Your inspiration has come FROM the People
Then let it go straight TOthe Peoplenot the literary readers of the monthly periodicals therich who would only be indirectly interested
If you must publish itlet it be in the daily press
Dont interrupt
know what you will say
It will be that the daily press is common is vulgar is undignifiedand tell you that such poem as this of yours called as it is TheToilers must be read BY the Toilers
It MUST BE common it must bevulgarised
You must not stand upon your dignity with the People if youare to reach themThat is true suppose Presley admitted but cant get rid of theidea that it would be throwing my poem away
The great magazine gives mesuchabackground gives me such weightGives YOU such weight gives you such background
Is it YOURSELF youthink of
You helper of the helpless
Is that your sincerity
You mustsink yourself must forget yourself and your own desire of fame ofadmitted success
It is your POEM your MESSAGE that mustprevailnot YOU who wrote it
You preach doctrine of abnegation ofselfobliteration and you sign your name to your words as high on thetablets as you can reach so that all the world may see not the poembut the poet
Presley there are many like you
The social reformerwrites book on the iniquity of the possession of land and out of theproceeds buys corner lot
The economist who laments the hardships ofthe poor allows himself to grow rich upon the sale of his bookBut Presley would hear no further
No he cried know am sincere and to prove it to you willpublish my poem as you say in the daily press and will accept nomoney for itThey talked on for about an hour while the evening wore away
Presleyvery soon noticed that Vanamee was again preoccupied
More than everof late his silence his brooding had increased
By and by he roseabruptly turning his head to the north in the direction of the Missionchurch of San Juan
think he said to Presley that must begoingGoing
Where to at this time of nightOff there Vanamee made an uncertain gesture toward the north
Goodbye and without another word he disappeared in the grey of thetwilight
Presley was left alone wondering
He found his horse andtightening the girths mounted and rode home under the sheen of thestars thoughtful his head bowed
Before he went to bed that nighthe sent The Toilers to the Sunday Editor of daily newspaper in SanFrancisco
Upon leaving Presley Vanamee his thumbs hooked into his emptycartridge belt strode swiftly down from the hills of the Los Muertosstockrange and on through the silent town of Guadalajara
His leanswarthy face with its hollow cheeks fine black pointed beardand sad eyes was set to the northward
As was his custom he wasbareheaded and the rapidity of his stride made breeze in his longblack hair
He knew where he was going
He knew what he must livethrough that night
Again the deathless grief that never slept leaped out of the shadowsand fastened upon his shoulders
It was scourging him back to that sceneof vanished happiness dead romance perished idylthe Missiongarden in the shade of the venerable pear trees
But besides this other influences tugged at his heart
There was amystery in the garden
In that spot the night was not always empty thedarkness not always silent
Something far off stirred and listened tohis cry at times drawing nearer to him
At first this presence hadbeen matter for terror but of late as he felt it gradually drawingnearer the terror had at long intervals given place to feeling of analmost ineffable sweetness
But distrusting his own senses unwillingto submit himself to such torturing uncertain happiness averse to theterrible confusion of spirit that followed upon night spent in thegarden Vanamee had tried to keep away from the place
However when thesorrow of his life reassailed him and the thoughts and recollections ofAngele brought the ache into his heart and the tears to his eyes thetemptation to return to the garden invariably gripped him close
Therewere times when he could not resist
Of themselves his footsteps turnedin that direction
It was almost as if he himself had been called
Guadalajara was silent dark
Not even in Solotaris was there light
The town was asleep
Only the inevitable guitar hummed from an unseendobe
Vanamee pushed on
The smell of the fields and open country anda distant scent of flowers that he knew well came to his nostrilsas he emerged from the town by way of the road that led on towards theMission through Quien Sabe
On either side of him lay the brown earthsilently nurturing the implanted seed
Two days before it had rainedcopiously and the soil still moist disengaged pungent aroma offecundity
Vanamee following the road passed through the collection of buildingsof Annixters home ranch
Everything slept
At intervals the aermotoron the artesian well creaked audibly as it turned in languid breezefrom the northeast
cat hunting fieldmice crept from the shadowof the gigantic barn and paused uncertainly in the open the tip ofher tail twitching
From within the barn itself came the sound of thefriction of heavy body and stir of hoofs as one of the dozing cowslay down with long breath
Vanamee left the ranch house behind him and proceeded on his way
Beyondhim to the right of the road he could make out the higher ground inthe Mission enclosure and the watching tower of the Mission itself
Theminutes passed
He went steadily forward
Then abruptly he paused hishead in the air eye and ear alert
To that strange sixth sense of hisresponsive as the leaves of the sensitive plant had suddenly come theimpression of human being near at hand
He had neither seen norheard but for all that he stopped an instant in his tracks then thesensation confirmed went on again with slow steps advancing warily
At last his swiftly roving eyes lighted upon an object just darkerthan the greybrown of the nightridden land
It was at some distancefrom the roadside
Vanamee approached it cautiously leaving the roadtreading carefully upon the moist clods of earth underfoot
Twenty pacesdistant he halted
Annixter was there seated upon round white rock his back towardshim
He was leaning forward his elbows on his knees his chin in hishands
He did not move
Silent motionless he gazed out upon the flatsombre land
It was the night wherein the master of Quien Sabe wrought out hissalvation struggling with Self from dusk to dawn
At the moment whenVanamee came upon him the turmoil within him had only begun
Theheart of the man had not yet wakened
The night was young the dawn fardistant and all around him the fields of upturned clods lay bare andbrown empty of all life unbroken by single green shoot
For moment the lifecircles of these two men of so widely differingcharacters touched each other there in the silence of the night underthe stars
Then silently Vanamee withdrew going on his way wonderingat the trouble that like himself drove this hardheaded man of affairsuntroubled by dreams out into the night to brood over an empty land
Then speedily he forgot all else
The material world drew off from him
Reality dwindled to point and vanished like the vanishing of starat moonrise
Earthly things dissolved and disappeared as strangeunnamed essence flowed in upon him
new atmosphere for him pervadedhis surroundings
He entered the world of the Vision of the Legend ofthe Miracle where all things were possible
He stood at the gate of theMission garden
Above him rose the ancient tower of the Mission church
Through thearches at its summit where swung the Spanish queens bells he saw theslowburning stars
The silent bats with flickering wings threw theirdancing shadows on the pallid surface of the venerable facade
Not the faintest chirring of cricket broke the silence
The bees wereasleep
In the grasses in the trees deep in the calix of punka flowerand magnolia bloom the gnats the caterpillars the beetles all themicroscopic multitudinous life of the daytime drowsed and dozed
Noteven the minute scuffling of lizard over the warm worn pavement ofthe colonnade disturbed the infinite repose the profound stillness
Only within the garden the intermittent trickling of the fountain madeitself heard flowing steadily marking off the lapse of secondsthe progress of hours the cycle of years the inevitable march ofcenturies
At one time the doorway before which Vanamee now stood hadbeen hermetically closed
But he himself had long since changed that
He stood before it for moment steeping himself in the mystery andromance of the place then raising he latch pushed open the gateentered and closed it softly behind him
He was in the cloister garden
The stars were out strewn thick and close in the deep blue of the skythe milky way glowing like silver veil
Ursa Major wheeled giganticin the north
The great nebula in Orion was whorl of shimmering stardust
Venus flamed lambent disk of pale saffron low over the horizon
From edge to edge of the world marched the constellations like theprogress of emperors and from the innumerable glory of their courses amysterious sheen of diaphanous light disengaged itself expanding overall the earth serene infinite majestic
The little garden revealed itself but dimly beneath the brooding lightonly half emerging from the shadow
The polished surfaces of the leavesof the pear trees winked faintly back the reflected light as the treesjust stirred in the uncertain breeze
blurred shield of silver markedthe ripples of the fountain
Under the flood of dull blue lustre thegravelled walks lay vague amid the grasses like webs of white satinon the bed of lake
Against the eastern wall the headstones of thegraves an indistinct procession of grey cowls ranged themselves
Vanamee crossed the garden pausing to kiss the turf upon Angelesgrave
Then he approached the line of pear trees and laid himself downin their shadow his chin propped upon his hands his eyes wanderingover the expanse of the little valley that stretched away from the footof the hill upon which the Mission was built
Once again he summoned the Vision
Once again he conjured up theIllusion
Once again tortured with doubt racked with deathlessgrief he craved an Answer of the night
Once again mystic that hewas he sent his mind out from him across the enchanted sea of theSupernatural
Hope of what he did not know roused up within him
Surely on such night as this the hallucination must define itself
Surely the Manifestation must be vouchsafed
His eyes closed his will girding itself to supreme effort his sensesexalted to state of pleasing numbness he called upon Angele to cometo him his voiceless cry penetrating far out into that sea of faintephemeral light that floated tideless over the little valley beneathhim
Then motionless prone upon the ground he waited
Months had passed since that first night when at length an Answer hadcome to Vanamee
At first startled out of all composure troubled andstirred to his lowest depths because of the very thing for which hesought he resolved never again to put his strange powers to the test
But for all that he had come second night to the garden and thirdand fourth
At last his visits were habitual
Night after nighthe was there surrendering himself to the influences of the placegradually convinced that something did actually answer when he called
His faith increased as the winter grew into spring
As the springadvanced and the nights became shorter it crystallised into certainty
Would he have her again his love long dead
Would she come to him oncemore out of the grave out of the night
He could not tell he couldonly hope
All that he knew was that his cry found an answer that hisoutstretched hands groping in the darkness met the touch of otherfingers
Patiently he waited
The nights became warmer as the springdrew on
The stars shone clearer
The nights seemed brighter
For nearlya month after the occasion of his first answer nothing new occurred
Some nights it failed him entirely upon others it was faint illusive
Then at last the most subtle the barest of perceptible changes began
His groping mind faroff there wandering like lost bird over thevalley touched upon some thing again touched and held it and thistime drew it single step closer to him
His heart beating the bloodsurging in his temples he watched with the eyes of his imaginationthis gradual approach
What was coming to him
Who was coming to him
Shrouded in the obscurity of the night whose was the face now turnedtowards his
Whose the footsteps that with such infinite slowness drewnearer to where he waited
He did not dare to say
His mind went back many years to that time before the tragedy ofAngeles death before the mystery of the Other
He waited then as hewaited now
But then he had not waited in vain
Then as now he hadseemed to feel her approach seemed to feel her drawing nearer andnearer to their rendezvous
Now what would happen
He did not know
He waited hoping all things
He waited believing all things
He waited enduring all things
He trusted in the Vision
Meanwhile as spring advanced the flowers in the Seed ranch beganto come to life
Over the five hundred acres whereon the flowers wereplanted the widening growth of vines and bushes spread like the wavesof green sea
Then timidly colours of the faintest tints began toappear
Under the moonlight Vanamee saw them expanding delicatepink faint blue tenderest variations of lavender and yellow whiteshimmering with reflections of gold all subdued and pallid in themoonlight
By degrees the night became impregnated with the perfume of theflowers
Illusive at first evanescent as filaments of gossamer thenas the buds opened emphasising itself breathing deeper stronger
Anexquisite mingling of many odours passed continually over the Missionfrom the garden of the Seed ranch meeting and blending with the aromaof its magnolia buds and punka blossoms
As the colours of the flowers of the Seed ranch deepened and as theirodours penetrated deeper and more distinctly as the starlight of eachsucceeding night grew brighter and the air became warmer the illusiondefined itself
By imperceptible degrees as Vanamee waited under theshadows of the pear trees the Answer grew nearer and nearer
He sawnothing but the distant glimmer of the flowers
He heard nothing butthe drip of the fountain
Nothing moved about him but the invisibleslowpassing breaths of perfume yet he felt the approach of the Vision
It came first to about the middle of the Seed ranch itself some halfa mile away where the violets grew shrinking timid flowers hidingclose to the ground
Then it passed forward beyond the violets and drewnearer and stood amid the mignonette hardier blooms that daredlook heavenward from out the leaves
few nights later it left themignonette behind and advanced into the beds of white iris that pushedmore boldly forth from the earth their waxen petals claiming theattention
It advanced then long step into the proud challengingbeauty of the carnations and roses and at last after many nightsVanamee felt that it paused as if trembling at its hardihood fullin the superb glory of the royal lilies themselves that grew on theextreme border of the Seed ranch nearest to him
After this there wasa certain long wait
Then upon dark midnight it advanced again
Vanamee could scarcely repress cry
Now the illusion emerged from theflowers
It stood not distant but unseen almost at the base of thehill upon whose crest he waited in depression of the ground where theshadows lay thickest
It was nearly within earshot
The nights passed
The spring grew warmer
In the daytime intermittentrains freshened all the earth
The flowers of the Seed ranch grewrapidly
Bud after bud burst forth while those already opened expandedto full maturity
The colour of the Seed ranch deepened
One night after hours of waiting Vanamee felt upon his cheek the touchof prolonged puff of warm wind breathing across the little valleyfrom out the east
It reached the Mission garden and stirred thebranches of the pear trees
It seemed veritably to be compounded ofthe very essence of the flowers
Never had the aroma been so sweet sopervasive
It passed and faded leaving in its wake an absolute silence
Then at length the silence of the night that silence to which Vanameehad so long appealed was broken by tiny sound
Alert halfrisen fromthe ground he listened for now at length he heard something
Thesound repeated itself
It came from near at hand from the thick shadowat the foot of the hill
What it was he could not tell but it did notbelong to single one of the infinite similar noises of the place withwhich he was so familiar
It was neither the rustle of leaf the snapof parted twig the drone of an insect the dropping of magnoliablossom
It was vibration merely faint elusive impossible ofdefinition minute notch in the fine keen edge of stillness
Again the nights passed
The summer stars became brighter
The warmthincreased
The flowers of the Seed ranch grew still more
The fivehundred acres of the ranch were carpeted with them
At length upon certain midnight new light began to spread inthe sky
The thin scimitar of the moon rose veiled and dim behind theearthmists
The light increased
Distant objects until now hiddencame into view and as the radiance brightened Vanamee looking downupon the little valley saw spectacle of incomparable beauty
All thebuds of the Seed ranch had opened
The faint tints of the flowers haddeepened had asserted themselves
They challenged the eye
Pink becamea royal red
Blue rose into purple
Yellow flamed into orange
Orangeglowed golden and brilliant
The earth disappeared under great bands andfields of resplendent colour
Then at length the moon abruptly soaredzenithward from out the veiling mist passing from one filmy haze toanother
For moment there was gleam of golden light and Vanameehis eyes searching the shade at the foot of the hill felt his heartsuddenly leap and then hang poised refusing to beat
In that instantof passing light something had caught his eye
Something that moveddown there half in and half out of the shadow at the hills foot
It had come and gone in an instant
The haze once more screened themoonlight
The shade again engulfed the vision
What was it he had seen
He did not know
So brief had been that movement the drowsy brain hadnot been quick enough to interpret the cipher message of the eye
Nowit was gone
But something had been there
He had seen it
Was it thelifting of strand of hair the wave of white hand the flutter of agarments edge
He could not tell but it did not belong to any of thosesights which he had seen so often in that place
It was neither theglancing of moths wing the nodding of windtouched blossom northe noiseless flitting of bat
It was gleam merely faint elusiveimpossible of definition an intangible agitation in the vast dim blurof the darkness
And that was all
Until now no single real thing had occurred nothingthat Vanamee could reduce to terms of actuality nothing he could putinto words
The manifestation when not recognisable to that strangesixth sense of his appealed only to the most refined the most delicateperception of eye and ear
It was all ephemeral filmy dreamy themystic forming of the Visionthe invisible developing concretenucleus the starlight coagulating the radiance of the flowersthickening to something actual perfume the most delicious fragrancebecoming tangible presence
But into that garden the serpent intruded
Though cradled in the slowrhythm of the dream lulled by this beauty of summers night heavywith the scent of flowers the silence broken only by ripplingfountain the darkness illuminated by world of radiant blossomsVanamee could not forget the tragedy of the Other that terror of manyyears agothat prowler of the night that strange fearful figure withthe unseen face swooping in there from out the darkness gone inan instant yet leaving behind the trail and trace of death and ofpollution
Never had Vanamee seen this more clearly than when leaving Presley onthe stock range of Los Muertos he had come across to the Mission gardenby way of the Quien Sabe ranch
It was the same night in which Annixter outwatched the stars comingat last to himself
As the hours passed the two men far apart ignoring each other waitedfor the ManifestationAnnixter on the ranch Vanamee in the garden
Prone upon his face under the pear trees his forehead buried in thehollow of his arm Vanamee lay motionless
For the last time raisinghis head he sent his voiceless cry out into the night across themulticoloured levels of the little valley calling upon the miraclesummoning the darkness to give Angele back to him resigning himself tothe hallucination
He bowed his head upon his arm again and waited
Theminutes passed
The fountain dripped steadily
Over the hills haze ofsaffron light foretold the rising of the full moon
Nothing stirred
Thesilence was profound
Then abruptly Vanamees right hand shut tight upon his wrist
Therethere it was
It began again his invocation was answered
Faroff there the ripple formed again upon the still black pool ofthe night
No sound no sight vibration merely appreciable by somesublimated faculty of the mind as yet unnamed
Rigid his nerves tautmotionless prone on the ground he waited
It advanced with infinite slowness
Now it passed through the beds ofviolets now through the mignonette
moment later and he knew itstood among the white iris
Then it left those behind
It was in thesplendour of the red roses and carnations
It passed like moving starinto the superb abundance the imperial opulence of the royal lilies
It was advancing slowly but there was no pause
He held his breath notdaring to raise his head
It passed beyond the limits of the Seed ranchand entered the shade at the foot of the hill below him
Would it comefarther than this
Here it had always stopped hitherto stopped for amoment and then in spite of his efforts had slipped from his graspand faded back into the night
But now he wondered if he had beenwilling to put forth his utmost strength after all
Had there notalways been an element of dread in the thought of beholding the mysteryface to face
Had he not even allowed the Vision to dissolve the Answerto recede into the obscurity whence it came
But never night had been so beautiful as this
It was the full periodof the spring
The air was veritable caress
The infinite reposeof the little garden sleeping under the night was delicious beyondexpression
It was tiny corner of the world shut off discreetdistilling romance garden of dreams of enchantments
Below in the little valley the resplendent colourations of the millionflowers roses lilies hyacinths carnations violets glowed likeincandescence in the golden light of the rising moon
The air was thickwith the perfume heavy with it clogged with it
The sweetnessfilled the very mouth
The throat choked with it
Overhead wheeled theillimitable procession of the constellations
Underfoot the earth wasasleep
The very flowers were dreaming
cathedral hush overlay allthe land and sense of benediction brooded lowa divine kindlinessmanifesting itself in beauty in peace in absolute repose
It was time for visions
It was the hour when dreams come true andlying deep in the grasses beneath the pear trees Vanamee dizzied withmysticism reaching up and out toward the supernatural felt as itwere his mind begin to rise upward from out his body
He passed into astate of being the like of which he had not known before
He felt thathis imagination was reshaping itself preparing to receive an impressionnever experienced until now
His body felt light to him then itdwindled vanished
He saw with new eyes heard with new ears felt witha new heart
Come to me he murmured
Then slowly he felt the advance of the Vision
It was approaching
Everyinstant it drew gradually nearer
At last he was to see
It had leftthe shadow at the base of the hill it was on the hill itself
Slowlysteadily it ascended the slope just below him there he heard faintstirring
The grasses rustled under the touch of foot
The leavesof the bushes murmured as hand brushed against them slender twigcreaked
The sounds of approach were more distinct
They came nearer
They reached the top of the hill
They were within whispering distance
Vanamee trembling kept his head buried in his arm
The sounds atlength paused definitely
The Vision could come no nearer
He raisedhis head and looked
The moon had risen
Its great shield of goldstood over the eastern horizon
Within six feet of Vanamee clear anddistinct against the disk of the moon stood the figure of younggirl
She was dressed in gown of scarlet silk with flowing sleevessuch as Japanese wear embroidered with flowers and figures ofbirds worked in gold threads
On either side of her face makingthreecornered her round white forehead hung the soft masses of herhair of gold
Her hands hung limply at her sides
But from between herparted lipslips of almost an Egyptian fulnessher breath came slowand regular and her eyes heavy lidded slanting upwards toward thetemples perplexing oriental were closed
She was asleep
From out this life of flowers this world of colour this atmosphereoppressive with perfume this darkness clogged and cloyed and thickenedwith sweet odours she came to him
She came to him from out of theflowers the smell of the roses in her hair of gold the aroma and theimperial red of the carnations in her lips the whiteness of the liliesthe perfume of the lilies and the lilies slender balancing grace inher neck
Her hands disengaged the scent of the heliotrope
The folds ofher scarlet gown gave off the enervating smell of poppies
Her feet wereredolent of hyacinth
She stood before him Vision realiseda dreamcome true
She emerged from out the invisible
He beheld her figureof gold and pale vermilion redolent of perfume poised motionless inthe faint saffron sheen of the newrisen moon
She creation of sleepwas herself asleep
She dream was herself dreaming
Called forth from out the darkness from the grip of the earth theembrace of the grave from out the memory of corruption she rose intolight and life divinely pure
Across that white forehead was no smudgeno trace of an earthly pollutionno mark of terrestrial dishonour
He saw in her the same beauty of untainted innocence he had known in hisyouth
Years had made no difference with her
She was still young
It was the old purity that returned the deathless beauty theeverrenascent life the eternal consecrated and immortal youth
For afew seconds she stood there before him and he upon the ground at herfeet looked up at her spellbound
Then slowly she withdrew
Stillasleep her eyelids closed she turned from him descending the slope
She was gone
Vanamee started up coming as it were to himself looking wildly abouthim
Sarria was there
saw her said the priest
It was Angele the little girl yourAngeles daughter
She is like her motherBut Vanamee scarcely heard
He walked as if in trance pushing bySarria going forth from the garden
Angele or Angeles daughter it wasall one with him
It was She
Death was overcome
The grave vanquished
Life everrenewed alone existed
Time was naught change was naughtall things were immortal but evil all things eternal but grief
Suddenly the dawn came the east burned roseate toward the zenith
Vanamee walked on he knew not where
The dawn grew brighter
At lengthhe paused upon the crest of hill overlooking the ranchos and cast hiseye below him to the southward
Then suddenly flinging up his arms heuttered great cry
There it was
The Wheat
The Wheat
In the night it had come up
It wasthere everywhere from margin to margin of the horizon
The earth longempty teemed with green life
Once more the pendulum of the seasonsswung in its mighty arc from death back to life
Life out of deatheternity rising from out dissolution
There was the lesson
Angele wasnot the symbol but the PROOF of immortality
The seed dying rottingand corrupting in the earth rising again in life unconquerable andin immaculate purityAngele dying as she gave birth to her littledaughter life springing from her deaththe pure unconquerablecoming forth from the defiled
Why had he not had the knowledge of God
Thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die
So theseed had died
So died Angele
And that which thou sowest thou sowestnot that body that shall be but bare grain
It may chance of wheat orof some other grain
The wheat called forth from out the darknessfrom out the grip of the earth of the grave from out corruptionrose triumphant into light and life
So Angele so life so also theresurrection of the dead
It is sown in corruption
It is raised inincorruption
It is sown in dishonour
It is raised in glory
It is sownin weakness
It is raised in power
Death was swallowed up in Victory
The sun rose
The night was over
The glory of the terrestrial was oneand the glory of the celestial was another
Then as the glory of sunbanished the lesser glory of moon and stars Vanamee from his mountaintop beholding the eternal green life of the growing Wheat bursting itsbonds and in his heart exulting in his triumph over the grave flungout his arms with mighty shoutOh Death where is thy sting
Oh Grave where is thy victoryCHAPTER IVPresleys Socialistic poem The Toilers had an enormous success
Theeditor of the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco paper to whichit was sent printed it in Gothic type with scarehead title sodecorative as to be almost illegible and furthermore caused the poem tobe illustrated by one of the papers staff artists in most impressivefashion
The whole affair occupied an entire page
Thus advertised thepoem attracted attention
It was promptly copied in New York Bostonand Chicago papers
It was discussed attacked defended eulogisedridiculed
It was praised with the most fulsome adulation assailed withthe most violent condemnation
Editorials were written upon it
Specialarticles in literary pamphlets dissected its rhetoric and prosody
The phrases were quotedwere used as texts for revolutionary sermonsreactionary speeches
It was parodied it was distorted so as to read asan advertisement for patented cereals and infants foods
Finallythe editor of an enterprising monthly magazine reprinted the poemsupplementing it by photograph and biography of Presley himself
Presley was stunned bewildered
He began to wonder at himself
Washe actually the greatest American poet since Bryant
He had had nothought of fame while composing The Toilers He had only been movedto his hearts foundationsthoroughly in earnest seeing clearlyandhad addressed himself to the poems composition in happy moment whenwords came easily to him and the elaboration of fine sentences was notdifficult
Was it thus fame was achieved
For while he was temptedto cross the continent and go to New York and there come unto his ownenjoying the triumph that awaited him
But soon he denied himself thischeap reward
Now he was too much in earnest
He wanted to help hisPeople the community in which he livedthe little world of the SanJoaquin at grapples with the Railroad
The struggle had found its poet
He told himself that his place was here
Only the words of the managerof lecture bureau troubled him for moment
To range the entirenation telling all his countrymen of the drama that was working itselfout on this fringe of the continent this ignored and distant PacificCoast rousing their interest and stirring them up to actionappealedto him
It might do great good
To devote himself to the Cause accepting no penny of remuneration to give his life to loosing the gripof the ironhearted monster of steel and steam would be beyond questionheroic
Other States than California had their grievances
All over thecountry the family of cyclops was growing
He would declare himself thechampion of the People in their opposition to the Trust
He would be anapostle prophet martyr of Freedom
But Presley was essentially dreamer not man of affairs
Hehesitated to act at this precise psychological moment striking whilethe iron was yet hot and while he hesitated other affairs near at handbegan to absorb his attention
One night about an hour after he had gone to bed he was awakened bythe sound of voices on the porch of the ranch house and descendingfound Mrs Dyke there with Sidney
The exengineers mother was talkingto Magnus and Harran and crying as she talked
It seemed that Dyke wasmissing
He had gone into town early that afternoon with the wagon andteam and was to have been home for supper
By now it was ten oclockand there was no news of him
Mrs Dyke told how she first had goneto Quien Sabe intending to telephone from there to Bonneville butAnnixter was in San Francisco and in his absence the house waslocked up and the overseer who had duplicate key was himselfin Bonneville
She had telegraphed three times from Guadalajara toBonneville for news of her son but without result
Then at lasttortured with anxiety she had gone to Hoovens taking Sidney with herand had prevailed upon Bismarck to hitch up and drive her across LosMuertos to the Governors to beg him to telephone into Bonneville toknow what had become of Dyke
While Harran rang up Central in town Mrs Dyke told Presley and Magnusof the lamentable change in Dyke
They have broken my sons spirit Mr Derrick she said
If you wereonly there to see
Hour after hour he sits on the porch with his handslying open in his lap looking at them without word
He wont lookme in the face any more and he dont sleep
Night after night he haswalked the floor until morning
And he will go on that way for daystogether very silent without word and sitting still in his chairand then all of sudden he will break outoh Mr Derrick it isterribleinto an awful rage cursing swearing grinding his teethhis hands clenched over his head stamping so that the house shakes andsaying that if Behrman dont give him back his money he will killhim with his two hands
But that isnt the worst Mr Derrick
He goesto Mr Carahers saloon now and stays there for hours and listensto Mr Caraher
There is something on my sons mind know thereissomething that he and Mr Caraher have talked over together andI cant find out what it is
Mr Caraher is bad man and my son hasfallen under his influence The tears filled her eyes
Bravely sheturned to hide them turning away to take Sidney in her arms puttingher head upon the little girls shoulder
II havent broken down before Mr Derrick she said but after wehave been so happy in our little house just us threeand the futureseemed so brightoh God will punish the gentlemen who own the railroadfor being so hard and cruelHarran came out on the porch from the telephone and she interruptedherself fixing her eyes eagerly upon him
think it is all right Mrs Dyke he said reassuringly
We knowwhere he is believe
You and the little tad stay here and Hooven andI will go after himAbout two hours later Harran brought Dyke back to Los Muertos inHoovens wagon
He had found him at Carahers saloon very drunk
There was nothing maudlin about Dykes drunkenness
In him the alcoholmerely roused the spirit of evil vengeful reckless
As the wagon passed out from under the eucalyptus trees about the ranchhouse taking Mrs Dyke Sidney and the onetime engineer back to thehop ranch Presley leaning from his window heard the latter remarkCaraher is right
There is only one thing they listen to and thatsdynamiteThe following day Presley drove Magnus over to Guadalajara to take thetrain for San Francisco
But after he had said goodbye to the Governorhe was moved to go on to the hop ranch to see the condition of affairsin that quarter
He returned to Los Muertos overwhelmed with sadness andtrembling with anger
The hop ranch that he had last seen in the fulltide of prosperity was almost ruin
Work had evidently been abandonedlong since
Weeds were already choking the vines
Everywhere the polessagged and drooped
Many had even fallen dragging the vines with themspreading them over the ground in an inextricable tangle of deadleaves decaying tendrils and snarled string
The fence was brokenthe unfinished storehouse which never was to see completion was alamentable spectacle of gaping doors and windowsa melancholy skeleton
Last of all Presley had caught glimpse of Dyke himself seated inhis rocking chair on the porch his beard and hair unkempt motionlesslooking with vague eyes upon his hands that lay palm upwards and idle inhis lap
Magnus on his way to San Francisco was joined at Bonneville by Osterman
Upon seating himself in front of the master of Los Muertos in thesmokingcar of the train this latter pushing back his hat andsmoothing his bald head observedGovernor you look all frazeled out
Anything wrong these daysThe other answered in the negative but for all that Osterman wasright
The Governor had aged suddenly
His former erectness wasgone the broad shoulders stooped little the strong lines of histhinlipped mouth were relaxed and his hand as it clasped over theyellowed ivory knob of his cane had an unwonted tremulousness nothitherto noticeable
But the change in Magnus was more than physical
At last in the full tide of power President of the League known andtalked of in every county of the State leader in great struggleconsulted deferred to as the Prominent Man at length attaining thatposition so long and vainly sought for he yet found no pleasure inhis triumph and little but bitterness in life
His success had come bydevious methods had been reached by obscure means
He was briber
He could never forget that
To further his endsdisinterested publicspirited even philanthropic as those were hehad connived with knavery he the politician of the old school of suchrigorous integrity who had abandoned career rather than compromisewith honesty
At this eleventh hour involved and entrapped in thefinespun web of new order of things bewildered by Ostermansdexterity by his volubility and glibness goaded and harassed beyondthe point of reason by the aggression of the Trust he fought he had atlast failed
He had fallen he had given bribe
He had thought thatafter all this would make but little difference with him
The affairwas known only to Osterman Broderson and Annixter they would notjudge him being themselves involved
He could still preserve boldfront could still hold his head high
As time went on the affair wouldlose its point
But this was not so
Some subtle element of his character had forsakenhim
He felt it
He knew it
Some certain stiffness that had given himall his rigidity that had lent force to his authority weight to hisdominance temper to his fine inflexible hardness was diminishingday by day
In the decisions which he as President of the League wascalled upon to make so often he now hesitated
He could no longerbe arrogant masterful acting upon his own judgment independent ofopinion
He began to consult his lieutenants asking their advicedistrusting his own opinions
He made mistakes blunders and when thosewere brought to his notice took refuge in bluster
He knew it to beblusterknew that sooner or later his subordinates would recognise itas such
How long could he maintain his position
So only he could keephis grip upon the lever of control till the battle was over all wouldbe well
If not he would fall and once fallen he knew that nowbriber that he was he would never rise again
He was on his way at this moment to the city to consult with Lyman asto certain issue of the contest between the Railroad and the rancherswhich of late had been brought to his notice
When appeal had been taken to the Supreme Court by the LeaguesExecutive Committee certain test cases had been chosen which shouldrepresent all the lands in question
Neither Magnus nor Annixter hadso appealed believing of course that their cases were covered by thetest cases on trial at Washington
Magnus had here blundered again andthe Leagues agents in San Francisco had written to warn him that theRailroad might be able to take advantage of technicality and bypretending that neither Quien Sabe nor Los Muertos were included in theappeal attempt to put its dummy buyers in possession of the two ranchesbefore the Supreme Court handed down its decision
The ninety daysallowed for taking this appeal were nearly at an end and after then theRailroad could act
Osterman and Magnus at once decided to go up to thecity there joining Annixter who had been absent from Quien Sabe forthe last ten days and talk the matter over with Lyman
Lyman becauseof his position as Commissioner might be cognisant of the Railroadsplans and at the same time could give sound legal advice as to whatwas to be done should the new rumour prove true
Say remarked Osterman as the train pulled out of the Bonnevillestation and the two men settled themselves for the long journey sayGovernor whats all up with Buck Annixter these days
Hes got beanabout something sureI had not noticed answered Magnus
Annixter has been awaysome time lately
cannot imagine what should keep him so long in SanFranciscoThats it said Osterman winking
Have three guesses
Guess rightand you get cigar
guess girl spells Hilma Tree
And littlewhile ago she quit Quien Sabe and hiked out to Frisco
So did Buck
Do draw the cigar
Its up to you have noticed her observedMagnus
fine figure of woman
She would make some man good wifeHoh
Buck Annixter marry
Not much
Hes gone agirling at lastold Buck
Its as funny as twins
Have to josh him about it when seehim sureBut when Osterman and Magnus at last fell in with Annixter in thevestibule of the Lick House on Montgomery Street nothing could be gotout of him
He was in an execrable humour
When Magnus had broached thesubject of business he had declared that all business could go to potand when Osterman his tongue in his cheek had permitted himself amost distant allusion to feemale girl Annixter had cursed him for abusyface so vociferously and tersely that even Osterman was cowed
Well insinuated Osterman what are you dallying round Frisco somuch forCat fur to make kittenbreeches retorted Annixter with oracularvagueness
Two weeks before this time Annixter had come up to the city andhad gone at once to certain hotel on Bush Street behind the FirstNational Bank that he knew was kept by family connection of theTrees
In his conjecture that Hilma and her parents would stop here hewas right
Their names were on the register
Ignoring custom Annixtermarched straight up to their rooms and before he was well aware of itwas eating crow before old man Tree
Hilma and her mother were out at the time
Later on Mrs Tree returnedalone leaving Hilma to spend the day with one of her cousins who livedfar out on Stanyan Street in little house facing the park
Between Annixter and Hilmas parents reconciliation had beeneffected Annixter convincing them both of his sincerity in wishing tomake Hilma his wife
Hilma however refused to see him
As soon asshe knew he had followed her to San Francisco she had been unwillingto return to the hotel and had arranged with her cousin to spend anindefinite time at her house
She was wretchedly unhappy during all this time would not set foot outof doors and cried herself to sleep night after night
She detested thecity
Already she was miserably homesick for the ranch
She rememberedthe days she had spent in the little dairyhouse happy in her workmaking butter and cheese skimming the great pans of milk scouring thecopper vessels and vats plunging her arms elbow deep into the whitecurds coming and going in that atmosphere of freshness cleanlinessand sunlight gay singing supremely happy just because the sun shone
She remembered her long walks toward the Mission late in the afternoonsher excursions for cresses underneath the Long Trestle the crowing ofthe cocks the distant whistle of the passing trains the faint soundingof the Angelus
She recalled with infinite longing the solitary expanseof the ranches the level reaches between the horizons full of lightand silence the heat at noon the cloudless iridescence of the sunriseand sunset
She had been so happy in that life
Now all those days werepassed
This crude raw city with its crowding houses all of woodand tin its blotting fogs its uproarious trade winds disturbed andsaddened her
There was no outlook for the future
At length one day about week after Annixters arrival in the cityshe was prevailed upon to go for walk in the park
She went aloneputting on for the first time the little hat of black straw with itspuff of white silk her mother had bought for her pink shirtwaist herbelt of imitation alligator skin her new skirt of brown cloth and herlow shoes set off with their little steel buckles
She found tiny summer house built in Japanese fashion around adiminutive pond and sat there for while her hands folded in her lapamused with watching the goldfish wishingshe knew not what
Without any warning Annixter sat down beside her
She was toofrightened to move
She looked at him with wide eyes that began to fillwith tears
Oh she said at last ohI didnt knowWell exclaimed Annixter here you are at last
Ive been watchingthat blamed house till was afraid the policeman would move me on
Bythe Lord he suddenly cried youre pale
Youyou Hilma do you feelwellYesI am well she faltered
No youre not he declared
know better
You are coming back toQuien Sabe with me
This place dont agree with you
Hilma whatsall the matter
Why havent you let me see you all this time
Do youknowhow things are with me
Your mother told you didnt she
Do youknow how sorry am
Do you know that see now that made the mistakeof my life there that time under the Long Trestle
found it out thenight after you went away
sat all night on stone out on the ranchsomewhere and dont know exactly what happened but Ive been adifferent man since then
see things all different now
Why Ive onlybegun to live since then
know what love means now and instead ofbeing ashamed of it Im proud of it
If never was to see you again Iwould be glad Id lived through that night just the same
just wokeup that night
Id been absolutely and completely selfish up to themoment realised really loved you and now whether youll let memarry you or not mean to liveI dont know in different way
IveGOT to live different
Iwelloh cant make you understand butjust loving you has changed my life all around
Its made it easierto do the straight clean thing
want to do it its fun doing it
Remember once said was proud of being hard man driver ofbeing glad that people hated me and were afraid of me
Well since Iveloved you Im ashamed of it all
dont want to be hard any more andnobody is going to hate me if can help it
Im happy and want otherpeople so
love you he suddenly exclaimed love you and if youwill forgive me and if you will come down to such beast as amI want to be to you the best man can be to woman Hilma
Do youunderstand little girl
want to be your husbandHilma looked at the goldfishes through her tears
Have you got anything to say to me Hilma he asked after while
dont know what you want me to say she murmured
Yes you do he insisted
Ive followed you way up here to hear it
Ive waited around in these beastly draughty picnic grounds for over aweek to hear it
You know what want to hear HilmaWellI forgive you she hazarded
That will do for starter he answered
But thats not ITThen dont know whatShall say it for youShe hesitated long minute thenYou mightnt say it right she replied
Trust me for that
Shall say it for you HilmaI dont know what youll sayIll say what you are thinking of
Shall say itThere was very long pause
goldfish rose to the surface of thelittle pond with sharp rippling sound
The fog drifted overhead
There was nobody about
No said Hilma at length
III can say it for myself
Allat once she turned to him and put her arms around his neck
Oh DO youlove me she cried
Is it really true
Do you mean every word of it
And you are sorry and you WILL be good to me if will be your wife
Youwill be my dear dear husbandThe tears sprang to Annixters eyes
He took her in his arms and heldher there for moment
Never in his life had he felt so unworthy soundeserving of this clean pure girl who forgave him and trusted hisspoken word and believed him to be the good man he could only wish tobe
She was so far above him so exalted so noble that he should havebowed his forehead to her feet and instead she took him in her armsbelieving him to be good to be her equal
He could think of no wordsto say
The tears overflowed his eyes and ran down upon his cheeks
Shedrew away from him and held him second at arms length looking athim and he saw that she too had been crying
think he said we are couple of softiesNo no she insisted
want to cry and want you to cry too
Ohdear havent handkerchiefHere take mineThey wiped each others eyes like two children and for long time satin the deserted little Japanese pleasure house their arms about eachother talking talking talking
On the following Saturday they were married in an uptown Presbyterianchurch and spent the week of their honeymoon at small family hotelon Sutter Street
As matter of course they saw the sights of the citytogether
They made the inevitable bridal trip to the Cliff House andspent an afternoon in the grewsome and madetoorder beauties ofSutros Gardens they went through Chinatown the Palace Hotel thepark museumwhere Hilma resolutely refused to believe in the Egyptianmummyand they drove out in hired hack to the Presidio and the GoldenGate
On the sixth day of their excursions Hilma abruptly declared they hadhad enough of playing out and must be serious and get to work
This work was nothing less than the buying of the furniture andappointments for the rejuvenated ranch house at Quien Sabe where theywere to live
Annixter had telegraphed to his overseer to have thebuilding repainted replastered and reshingled and to empty the roomsof everything but the telephone and safe
He also sent instructions tohave the dimensions of each room noted down and the result forwardedto him
It was the arrival of these memoranda that had roused Hilma toaction
Then ensued most delicious week
Armed with formidable lists writtenby Annixter on hotel envelopes they two descended upon the departmentstores of the city the carpet stores the furniture stores
Right andleft they bought and bargained sending each consignment as soon aspurchased to Quien Sabe
Nearly an entire car load of carpets curtainskitchen furniture pictures fixtures lamps straw matting chairs andthe like were sent down to the ranch Annixter making point that theirnew home should be entirely equipped by San Francisco dealers
The furnishings of the bedroom and sittingroom were left to the verylast
For the former Hilma bought set of pure white enamel threechairs washstand and bureau marvellous bargain of thirty dollarsdiscovered by wonderful accident at Friday Sale The bed was apiece by itself bought elsewhere but none the less wonder
It was ofbrass very brave and gay and actually boasted canopy
They boughtit complete just as it stood in the window of the department store andHilma was in an ecstasy over its crisp clean muslin curtains spreadand shams
Never was there such bed the luxury of princess such abed as she had dreamed about her whole life
Next the appointments of the sittingroom occupied hersince Annixterhimself bewildered by this astonishing display unable to offer asingle suggestion himself merely approved of all she bought
In thesittingroom was to be beautiful blue and white paper cool strawmatting set off with white wool rugs stand of flowers in the windowa globe of goldfish rocking chairs sewing machine and greatround centre table of yellow oak whereon should stand lamp coveredwith deep shade of crinkly red tissue paper
On the walls were to hangseveral pictureslovely affairs photographs from life all properlytintedof choir boys in robes with beautiful eyes pensive young girlsin pink gowns with flowing yellow hair drooping over golden harps acoloured reproduction of Rouget de Lisle Singing the Marseillaise and two pieces of wood carving representing quail and wild duckhung by one leg in the midst of game bags and powder hornsquitemasterpieces both
At last everything had been bought all arrangements made Hilmastrunks packed with her new dresses and the tickets to Bonnevillebought
Well go by the Overland by Jingo declared Annixter across thetable to his wife at their last meal in the hotel where they had beenstopping no way trains or locals for us heyBut we reach Bonneville at SUCH an hour protested Hilma
Five in themorningNever mind he declared well go home in PULLMANS Hilma
Im notgoing to have any of those slobs in Bonneville say didnt know how todo the thing in style and well have Vacca meet us with the team
Nosir it is Pullmans or nothing
When it comes to buying furniture Idont shine perhaps but know whats due my wifeHe was obdurate and late one afternoon the couple boarded theTranscontinental the crack Overland Flyer of the Pacific andSouthwestern at the Oakland mole
Only Hilmas parents were there tosay goodbye
Annixter knew that Magnus and Osterman were in the citybut he had laid his plans to elude them
Magnus he could trust to bedignified but that goat Osterman one could never tell what he would donext
He did not propose to start his journey home in shower of rice
Annixter marched down the line of cars his hands encumbered with wickertelescope baskets satchels and valises his tickets in his mouth hishat on wrong side foremost Hilma and her parents hurrying on behindhim trying to keep up
Annixter was in turmoil of nerves lestsomething should go wrong catching train was always for him littlecrisis
He rushed ahead so furiously that when he had found his Pullmanhe had lost his party
He set down his valises to mark the place andcharged back along the platform waving his arms
Come on he cried when at length he espied the others
Weve nomore timeHe shouldered and urged them forward to where he had set his valisesonly to find one of them gone
Instantly he raised an outcry
Aha afine way to treat passengers
There was and management foryou
He would by the Lord he wouldbut the porter appeared in thevestibule of the car to placate him
He had already taken his valisesinside
Annixter would not permit Hilmas parents to board the car declaringthat the train might pull out any moment
So he and his wife followingthe porter down the narrow passage by the stateroom took their placesand raising the window leaned out to say goodbye to Mr and MrsTree
These latter would not return to Quien Sabe
Old man Tree hadfound business chance awaiting him in the matter of supplying hisrelatives hotel with dairy products
But Bonneville was not too farfrom San Francisco the separation was by no means final
The porters began taking up the steps that stood by the vestibule ofeach sleepingcar
Well have good time daughter observed her father and come up tosee us whenever you canFrom beyond the enclosure of the depots reverberating roof came themeasured clang of bell
guess were off cried Annixter
Goodbye Mrs TreeRemember your promise Hilma her mother hastened to exclaim towrite every Sunday afternoonThere came prolonged creaking and groan of straining wood and ironwork all along the length of the train
They all began to cry theirgoodbyes at once
The train stirred moved forward and gathering slowheadway rolled slowly out into the sunlight
Hilma leaned out of thewindow and as long as she could keep her mother in sight waved herhandkerchief
Then at length she sat back in her seat and looked at herhusband
Well she said
Well echoed Annixter happy for the tears rose in her eyes
She nodded energetically smiling at him bravely
You look little pale he declared frowning uneasily feel wellPretty wellPromptly he was seized with uneasiness
But not ALL well hey
Is thatitIt was true that Hilma had felt faint tremour of seasickness on theferryboat coming from the city to the Oakland mole
No doubt littlenausea yet remained with her
But Annixter refused to accept thisexplanation
He was distressed beyond expression
Now youre going to be sick he cried anxiously
No no she protested not bitBut you said you didnt feel very well
Where is it you feel sickI dont know
Im not sick
Oh dear me why will you botherHeadacheNot the leastYou feel tired then
Thats it
No wonder the way rushed you roundtodayDear Im NOT tired and Im NOT sick and Im all RIGHTNo no can tell
think wed best have the berth made up and youlie downThat would be perfectly ridiculousWell where is it you feel sick
Show me put your hand on the place
Want to eat somethingWith elaborate minuteness he crossquestioned her refusing to let thesubject drop protesting that she had dark circles under her eyes thatshe had grown thinner
Wonder if theres doctor on board he murmured looking uncertainlyabout the car
Let me see your tongue
knowa little whiskey is whatyou want that and some pruNo no NO she exclaimed
Im as well as ever was in all my life
Look at me
Now tell me do look likee sick ladyHe scrutinised her face distressfully
Now dont look the picture of health she challenged
In way you do he began and then againHilma beat tattoo with her heels upon the floor shutting herfists the thumbs tucked inside
She closed her eyes shaking her headenergetically
wont listen wont listen wont listen she cried
But just the sameGibblegibblegibble she mocked
wont Listen wont listen She put hand over his mouth
Look heres the diningcar waiter andthe first call for supper and your wife is hungryThey went forward and had supper in the diner while the long train nowout upon the main line settled itself to its pace the prolonged evengallop that it would hold for the better part of the week spinning outthe miles as cotton spinner spins thread
It was already dark when Antioch was left behind
Abruptly the sunsetappeared to wheel in the sky and readjusted itself to the right of thetrack behind Mount Diablo here visible almost to its base
The trainhad turned southward
Neroly was passed then Brentwood then Byron
In the gathering dusk mountains began to build themselves up on eitherhand far off blocking the horizon
The train shot forward roaring
Between the mountains the land lay level cut up into farms ranches
These continually grew larger growing wheat began to appear billowingin the wind of the trains passage
The mountains grew higher theland richer and by the time the moon rose the train was well into thenorthernmost limits of the valley of the San Joaquin
Annixter had engaged an entire section and after he and his wife wentto bed had the porter close the upper berth
Hilma sat up in bed tosay her prayers both hands over her face and then kissing Annixtergoodnight went to sleep with the directness of little child holdinghis hand in both her own
Annixter who never could sleep on the train dozed and tossed andfretted for hours consulting his watch and timetable whenever therewas stop twice he rose to get drink of ice water and betweenwhiles was forever sitting up in the narrow berth stretching himselfand yawning murmuring with uncertain relevanceOh Lord
Ohhh LORDThere were some dozen other passengers in the cara lady with threechildren group of schoolteachers couple of drummers stoutgentleman with whiskers and welldressed young man in plaidtravelling cap whom Annixter had observed before supper time readingDaudets Tartarin in the French
But by nine oclock all these people were in their berths
Occasionally above the rhythmic rumble of the wheels Annixter couldhear one of the ladys children fidgeting and complaining
The stoutgentleman snored monotonously in two notes one rasping bass theother prolonged treble
At intervals brakeman or the passengerconductor pushed down the aisle between the curtains his red andwhite lamp over his arm
Looking out into the car Annixter saw in an endsection where the berths had not been made up the porter in his whiteduck coat dozing his mouth wide open his head on his shoulder
The hours passed
Midnight came and went
Annixter checking off thestations noted their passage of Modesto Merced and Madeira
Thenafter another broken nap he lost count
He wondered where they were
Had they reached Fresno yet
Raising the window curtain he made shadewith both hands on either side of his face and looked out
The night wasthick dark clouded over
fine rain was falling leaving horizontalstreaks on the glass of the outside window
Only the faintest grey blurindicated the sky
Everything else was impenetrable blackness
think sure we must have passed Fresno he muttered
He looked at hiswatch
It was about halfpast three
If we have passed Fresno he saidto himself Id better wake the little girl pretty soon
Shell needabout an hour to dress
Better find out for sureHe drew on his trousers and shoes got into his coat and stepped outinto the aisle
In the seat that had been occupied by the porterthe Pullman conductor his cash box and carschedules before him waschecking up his berths blue pencil behind his ear
Whats the next stop Captain inquired Annixter coming up
Have wereached Fresno yetJust passed it the other responded looking at Annixter over hisspectacles
Whats the next stopGoshen
We will be there in about fortyfive minutesFair black night isnt itBlack as pocket
Lets see youre the party in upper and lower Annixter caught at the back of the nearest seat just in time to preventa fall and the conductors cash box was shunted off the surface of theplush seat and came clanking to the floor
The Pintsch lights overheadvibrated with blinding rapidity in the long sliding jar that ranthrough the train from end to end and the momentum of its speedsuddenly decreasing all but pitched the conductor from his seat
Ahideous earsplitting rasp made itself heard from the clampeddownWestinghouse gear underneath and Annixter knew that the wheels hadceased to revolve and that the train was sliding forward upon themotionless flanges
Hello hello he exclaimed whats all up nowEmergency brakes declared the conductor catching up his cash box andthrusting his papers and tickets into it
Nothing much probably cowon the trackHe disappeared carrying his lantern with him
But the other passengers all but the stout gentleman were awake headswere thrust from out the curtains and Annixter hurrying back to Hilmawas assailed by all manner of questions
What was thatAnything wrongWhats up anywaysHilma was just waking as Annixter pushed the curtain aside
Oh was so frightened
Whats the matter dear she exclaimed
dont know he answered
Only the emergency brakes
Just cow onthe track guess
Dont get scared
It isnt anythingBut with final shriek of the Westinghouse appliance the train came toa definite halt
At once the silence was absolute
The ears still numb with thelongcontinued roar of wheels and clashing iron at first refused toregister correctly the smaller noises of the surroundings
Voices camefrom the other end of the car strange and unfamiliar as though heardat great distance across the water
The stillness of the night outsidewas so profound that the rain dripping from the car roof upon theroadbed underneath was as distinct as the ticking of clock
Well weve sure stopped observed one of the drummers
What is it asked Hilma again
Are you sure theres nothing wrongSure said Annixter
Outside underneath their window they heard thesound of hurried footsteps crushing into the clinkers by the side of theties
They passed on and Annixter heard some one in the distance shoutYes on the other sideThen the door at the end of their car opened and brakeman with redbeard ran down the aisle and out upon the platform in front
The forwarddoor closed
Everything was quiet again
In the stillness the fatgentlemans snores made themselves heard once more
The minutes passed nothing stirred
There was no sound but the drippingrain
The line of cars lay immobilised and inert under the night
One ofthe drummers having stepped outside on the platform for look aroundreturned sayingThere sure isnt any station anywheres about and no siding
Bet youthey have had an accident of some kindAsk the porterI did
He dont knowMaybe they stopped to take on wood or water or somethingWell they wouldnt use the emergency brakes for that would they
Whythis train stopped almost in her own length
Pretty near slung me outthe berth
Those were the emergency brakes
heard some one say soFrom far out towards the front of the train near the locomotivecame the sharp incisive report of revolver then two more almostsimultaneously then after long interval fourth
Say thats SHOOTING
By God boys theyre shooting
Say this is aholdupInstantly whitehot excitement flared from end to end of thecar
Incredibly sinister heard thus in the night and in the rainmysterious fearful those four pistol shots started confusion from outthe sense of security like frightened rabbit hunted from her burrow
Wideeyed the passengers of the car looked into each others faces
Ithad come to them at last this they had so often read about
Now theywere to see the real thing now they were to face actuality face thisdanger of the night leaping in from out the blackness of the roadsidemasked armed ready to kill
They were facing it now
They were heldup
Hilma said nothing only catching Annixters hand looking squarely intohis eyes
Steady little girl he said
They cant hurt you
wont leave you
By the Lord he suddenly exclaimed his excitement getting the betterof him for moment
By the Lord its holdupThe schoolteachers were in the aisle of the car in night gownwrapper and dressing sack huddled together like sheep holding on toeach other looking to the men silently appealing for protection
Twoof them were weeping white to the lips
Oh oh oh its terrible
Oh if they only wont hurt meBut the lady with the children looked out from her berth smiledreassuringly and saidIm not bit frightened
They wont do anything to us if we keepquiet
Ive my watch and jewelry all ready for them in my little blackbag seeShe exhibited it to the passengers
Her children were all awake
Theywere quiet looking about them with eager faces interested and amusedat this surprise
In his berth the fat gentleman with whiskers snoredprofoundly
Say Im going out there suddenly declared one of the drummersflourishing pocket revolver
His friend caught his arm
Dont make fool of yourself Max he said
They wont come near us observed the welldressed young man theyare after the WellsFargo box and the registered mail
You wont do anygood out thereBut the other loudly protested
No he was going out
He didnt proposeto be buncoed without fight
He wasnt any coward
Well you dont go thats all said his friend angrily
Thereswomen and children in this car
You aint going to draw the fire hereWell thats to be thought of said the other allowing himself to bepacified but still holding his pistol
Dont let him open that window cried Annixter sharply from his placeby Hilmas side for the drummer had made as if to open the sash in oneof the sections that had not been made up
Sure thats right said the others
Dont open any windows
Keepyour head in
Youll get us all shot if you arent carefulHowever the drummer had got the window up and had leaned out before theothers could interfere and draw him away
Say by jove he shouted as he turned back to the car our enginesgone
Were standing on curve and you can see the end of the train
Shes gone tell you
Well look for yourselfIn spite of their precautions one after another his friends lookedout
Sure enough the train was without locomotive
Theyve done it so we cant get away vociferated the drummer withthe pistol
Now by jiminyChristmas theyll come through the cars andstand us up
Theyll be in here in minute
WHAT WAS THATFrom far away up the track apparently some halfmile ahead of thetrain came the sound of heavy explosion
The windows of the carvibrated with it
Shooting againThat isnt shooting exclaimed Annixter
Theyve pulled the expressand mail car on ahead with the engine and now they are dynamiting heropenThat must be it
Yes sure thats just what they are doingThe forward door of the car opened and closed and the schoolteachersshrieked and cowered
The drummer with the revolver faced about hiseyes bulging
However it was only the train conductor hatless hislantern in his hand
He was soaked with rain
He appeared in the aisle
Is there doctor in this car he asked
Promptly the passengers surrounded him voluble with questions
But hewas in bad temper
dont know anything more than you he shouted angrily
It was aholdup
guess you know that dont you
Well what more do you wantto know
aint got time to fool around
They cut off our express carand have cracked it open and they shot one of our train crew thatsall and want doctorDid they shoot himkill him do you meanIs he hurt badDid the men get awayOh shut up will you all exclaimed the conductor
What do know
Is there DOCTOR in this car thats what want toknowThe welldressed young man stepped forward
Im doctor he said
Well come along then returned theconductor in surly voice and the passengers in this car he addedturning back at the door and nodding his head menacingly will go backto bed and STAY there
Its all over and theres nothing to seeHe went out followed by the young doctor
Then ensued an interminable period of silence
The entire train seemeddeserted
Helpless bereft of its engine huge decapitated monster itlay halfway around curve rained upon abandoned
There was more fear in this last condition of affairs more terrorin the idea of this prolonged line of sleepers with their nickelledfittings their plate glass their upholstery vestibules and the likeloaded down with people lost and forgotten in the night and the rainthan there had been when the actual danger threatened
What was to become of them now
Who was there to help them
Their enginewas gone they were helpless
What next was to happen
Nobody came near the car
Even the porter had disappeared
The waitseemed endless and the persistent snoring of the whiskered gentlemanrasped the nerves like the scrape of file
Well how long are we going to stick here now began one of thedrummers
Wonder if they hurt the engine with their dynamiteOh know they will come through the car and rob us wailed theschoolteachers
The lady with the little children went back to bed and Annixterassured that the trouble was over did likewise
But nobody slept
Fromberth to berth came the sound of suppressed voices talking it all overformulating conjectures
Certain points seemed to be settled upon noone knew how as indisputable
The highwaymen had been four in numberand had stopped the train by pulling the bell cord
brakeman hadattempted to interfere and had been shot
The robbers had been on thetrain all the way from San Francisco
The drummer named Max rememberedto have seen four suspiciouslooking characters in the smokingcarat Lathrop and had intended to speak to the conductor about them
Thisdrummer had been in holdup before and told the story of it over andover again
At last after what seemed to have been an hours delay and when thedawn had already begun to show in the east the locomotive backed on tothe train again with reverberating jar that ran from car to car
Atthe jolting the schoolteachers screamed in chorus and the whiskeredgentleman stopped snoring and thrust his head from his curtainsblinking at the Pintsch lights
It appeared that he was an Englishman
say he asked of the drummer named Max say my friend whatplace is thisThe others roared with derision
We were HELD UP sir thats what we were
We were held up and youslept through it all
You missed the show of your lifeThe gentleman fixed the group with prolonged gaze
He said never aword but little by little he was convinced that the drummers told thetruth
All at once he grew wrathful his face purpling
He withdrew hishead angrily buttoning his curtains together in fury
The cause ofhis rage was inexplicable but they could hear him resettling himselfupon his pillows with exasperated movements of his head and shoulders
In few moments the deep bass and shrill treble of his snoring oncemore sounded through the car
At last the train got under way again with useless warning blasts ofthe engines whistle
In few moments it was tearing away throughthe dawn at wonderful speed rocking around curves roaring acrossculverts making up time
And all the rest of that strange night the passengers sitting up intheir unmade beds in the swaying car lighted by strange mingling ofpallid dawn and trembling Pintsch lights rushing at breakneck speedthrough the misty rain were oppressed by vision of figures of terrorfar behind them in the night they had left masked armed gallopingtoward the mountains pistol in hand the booty bound to the saddlebow galloping galloping on sending thrill of fear through all thecountry side
The young doctor returned
He sat down in the smokingroom lighting acigarette and Annixter and the drummers pressed around him to know thestory of the whole affair
The man is dead he declared the brakeman
He was shot through thelungs twice
They think the fellow got away with about five thousand ingold coinThe fellow
Wasnt there four of themNo only one
And say let me tell you he had his nerve with him
Itseems he was on the roof of the express car all the time and going asfast as we were he jumped from the roof of the car down on to the coalon the engines tender and crawled over that and held up the men in thecab with his gun took their guns from em and made em stop the train
Even ordered em to use the emergency gear seems he knew all about it
Then he went back and uncoupled the express car himself
While he was doing this brakemanyou remember that brakeman thatcame through here once or twicehad red mustacheTHAT chap Sure
Well as soon as the train stopped this brakemanguessed something was wrong and ran up saw the fellow cutting off theexpress car and took couple of shots at him and the fireman saysthe fellow didnt even take his hand off the couplingpin just turnedaround as cool as howdoyoudo and NAILED the brakeman right there
They werent five feet apart when they began shooting
The brakeman hadcome on him unexpected had no idea he was so closeAnd the express messenger all this timeWell he did his best
Jumped out with his repeating shotgun but thefellow had him covered before he could turn round
Held him up and tookhis gun away from him
Say you know call that nerve just the same
One man standing up whole trainload like that
Then as soon as hedcut the express car off he made the engineer run her up the track abouthalf mile to road crossing WHERE HE HAD HORSE TIED
What do youthink of that
Didnt he have it all figured out close
And when he gotthere he dynamited the safe and got the WellsFargo box
He took fivethousand in gold coin the messenger says it was railroad money that thecompany were sending down to Bakersfield to pay off with
It was in abag
He never touched the registered mail nor whole wad of greenbacksthat were in the safe but just took the coin got on his horse and litout
The engineer says he went to the eastardHe got away did heYes but they think theyll get him
He wore kind of mask but thebrakeman recognised him positively
We got his antemortem statement
The brakeman said the fellow had grudge against the road
He was adischarged employee and lives near BonnevilleDyke by the Lord exclaimed Annixter
Thats the name said the young doctor
When the train arrived at Bonneville forty minutes behind time itlanded Annixter and Hilma in the midst of the very thing they mostwished to avoidan enormous crowd
The news that the Overland had beenheld up thirty miles south of Fresno brakeman killed and the safelooted and that Dyke alone was responsible for the nights workhad been wired on ahead from Fowler the train conductor throwing thedespatch to the station agent from the flying train
Before the train had come to standstill under the arched roof of theBonneville depot it was all but taken by assault
Annixter with Hilmaon his arm had almost to fight his way out of the car
The depot wasblack with people
Behrman was there Delaney Cyrus Ruggles thetown marshal the mayor
Genslinger his hat on the back of hishead ranged the train from cab to rearlights notebook in handinterviewing questioning collecting facts for his extra
As Annixterdescended finally to the platform the editor alert as blackandtanterrier his thin osseous hands quivering with eagerness his browndry face working with excitement caught his elbow
Can have your version of the affair Mr AnnixterAnnixter turned on him abruptly
Yes he exclaimed fiercely
You and your gang drove Dyke from his jobbecause he wouldnt work for starvation wages
Then you raised freightrates on him and robbed him of all he had
You ruined him and drove himto fill himself up with Carahers whiskey
Hes only taken back what youplundered him of and now youre going to hound him over the Statehunt him down like wild animal and bring him to the gallows at SanQuentin
Thats my version of the affair Mister Genslinger but itsworth your subsidy from the and to print itThere was murmur of approval from the crowd that stood around andGenslinger with an angry shrug of one shoulder took himself away
At length Annixter brought Hilma through the crowd to where young Vaccawas waiting with the team
However they could not at once start forthe ranch Annixter wishing to ask some questions at the freight officeabout final consignment of chairs
It was nearly eleven oclock beforethey could start home
But to gain the Upper Road to Quien Sabe it wasnecessary to traverse all of Main Street running through the heart ofBonneville
The entire town seemed to be upon the sidewalks
By now the rain wasover and the sun shining
The story of the holdupthe work of manwhom every one knew and likedwas in every mouth
How had Dyke come todo it
Who would have believed it of him
Think of his poor motherand the little tad
Well after all he was not so much to blame therailroad people had brought it on themselves
But he had shot manto death
Ah that was serious business
Goodnatured bigbroadshouldered jovial Dyke the man they knew with whom they hadshaken hands only yesterday yes and drank with him
He had shot mankilled him had stood there in the dark and in the rain while theywere asleep in their beds and had killed man
Now where was he
Instinctively eyes were turned eastward over the tops of the housesor down vistas of side streets to where the foothills of the mountainsrose dim and vast over the edge of the valley
He was in amongst themsomewhere in all that pile of blue crests and purple canyons he washidden away
Now for weeks of searching false alarms clews trailingswatchings all the thrill and heartbursting excitement of manhunt
Would he get away
Hardly man on the sidewalks of the town that daywho did not hope for it
As Annixters team trotted through the central portion of the townyoung Vacca pointed to denser and larger crowd around the rearentrance of the City Hall
Fully twenty saddle horses were tied tothe iron rail underneath the scant halfgrown trees near by and asAnnixter and Hilma drove by the crowd parted and dozen men withrevolvers on their hips pushed their way to the curbstone and mountingtheir horses rode away at gallop
Its the posse said young Vacca
Outside the town limits the ground was level
There was nothing toobstruct the view and to the north in the direction of Ostermansranch Vacca made out another party of horsemen galloping eastward andbeyond these still another
Therere the other posses he announced
That further one is ArchieMoores
Hes the sheriff
He came down from Visalia on special enginethis morningWhen the team turned into the driveway to the ranch house Hilma uttereda little cry clasping her hands joyfully
The house was one glitterof new white paint the driveway had been freshly gravelled theflowerbeds replenished
Mrs Vacca and her daughter who had been busyputting on the finishing touches came to the door to welcome them
Whats this case here asked Annixter when after helping his wifefrom the carryall his eye fell upon wooden box of some three by fivefeet that stood on the porch and bore the red WellsFargo label
It came here last night addressed to you sir exclaimed Mrs Vacca
We were sure it wasnt any of your furniture so we didnt open itOh maybe its wedding present exclaimed Hilma her eyes sparkling
Well maybe it is returned her husband
Here son help me inwith thisAnnixter and young Vacca bore the case into the sittingroom of thehouse and Annixter hammer in hand attacked it vigorously
Vaccadiscreetly withdrew on signal from his mother closing the door afterhim
Annixter and his wife were left alone
Oh hurry hurry cried Hilma dancing around him
want to see what it is
Who do you suppose could have sent it to us
And so heavy too
What do you think it can beAnnixter put the claw of the hammer underneath the edge of the board topand wrenched with all his might
The boards had been clamped together bya transverse bar and the whole top of the box came away in one piece
layer of excelsior was disclosed and on it letter addressed bytypewriter to Annixter
It bore the trademark of business firm of LosAngeles
Annixter glanced at this and promptly caught it up before Hilmacould see with an exclamation of intelligence
Oh know what this is he observed carelessly trying to restrainher busy hands
It isnt anything
Just some machinery
Let it go But already she had pulled away the excelsior
Underneath in temporaryracks were two dozen Winchester repeating rifles
Whywhatwhat murmured Hilma blankly
Well told you not to mind said Annixter
It isnt anything
Letslook through the roomsBut you said you knew what it was she protested bewildered
Youwanted to make believe it was machinery
Are you keeping anything fromme
Tell me what it all means
Oh why are you gettingtheseShe caught his arm looking with intense eagerness into his face
Shehalf understood already
Annixter saw that
Well he said lamely YOU knowit may not come to anything at allbut you knowwell this League of ourssuppose the Railroad tries tojump Quien Sabe or Los Muertos or any of the other rancheswe made upour mindsthe Leaguers havethat we wouldnt let it
Thats allAnd thought cried Hilma drawing back fearfully from the case ofrifles and thought it was wedding presentAnd that was their homecoming the end of their bridal trip
Throughthe terror of the night echoing with pistol shots through that sceneof robbery and murder into this atmosphere of alarms manhuntorganising armed horsemen silhouetted against the horizons cases ofrifles where wedding presents should have been Annixter brought hisyoung wife to be mistress of home he might at any moment be calledupon to defend with his life
The days passed
Soon week had gone by
Magnus Derrick and Ostermanreturned from the city without any definite idea as to the Corporationsplans
Lyman had been reticent
He knew nothing as to the progress ofthe land cases in Washington
There was no news
The Executive Committeeof the League held perfunctory meeting at Los Muertos at which nothingbut routine business was transacted
scheme put forward by Ostermanfor conference with the railroad managers fell through because of therefusal of the company to treat with the ranchers upon any other basisthan that of the new grading
It was impossible to learn whether or notthe company considered Los Muertos Quien Sabe and the ranches aroundBonneville covered by the test cases then on appeal
Meanwhile there was no decrease in the excitement that Dykes holduphad set loose over all the county
Day after day it was the one topic ofconversation at street corners at crossroads over dinner tables inoffice bank and store
Behrman placarded the town with noticeof reward for the exengineers capture dead or alive and theexpress company supplemented this by another offer of an equal amount
The country was thick with parties of horsemen armed with riflesand revolvers recruited from Visalia Goshen and the few railroadsympathisers around Bonneville and Guadlajara
One after another ofthese returned emptyhanded covered with dust and mud their horsesexhausted to be met and passed by fresh posses starting out to continuethe pursuit
The sheriff of Santa Clara County sent down his bloodhoundsfrom San Josesmall harmlesslooking dogs with terrific baytohelp in the chase
Reporters from the San Francisco papers appearedinterviewing every one sometimes even accompanying the searching bands
Horse hoofs clattered over the roads at night bells were rung theMercury issued extra after extra the bloodhounds bayed gun buttsclashed on the asphalt pavements of Bonneville accidental discharges ofrevolvers brought the whole town into the street farm hands calledto each other across the fences of ranchdivisionsin word thecountryside was in an uproar
And all to no effect
The hoofmarks of Dykes horse had been traced inthe mud of the road to within quarter of mile of the foothills andthere irretrievably lost
Three days after the holdup sheepherderwas found who had seen the highwayman on ridge in the highermountains to the northeast of Taurusa
And that was absolutely all
Rumours were thick promising clews were discovered new trails takenup but nothing transpired to bring the pursuers and pursued any closertogether
Then after ten days of strain public interest began to flag
It was believed that Dyke had succeeded in getting away
If this wastrue he had gone to the southward after gaining the mountains andit would be his intention to work out of the range somewhere near thesouthern part of the San Joaquin near Bakersfield
Thus the sheriffsmarshals and deputies decided
They had hunted too many criminals inthese mountains before not to know the usual courses taken
In timeDyke MUST come out of the mountains to get water and provisions
Butthis time passed and from not one of the watched points came any wordof his appearance
At last the posses began to disband
Little by littlethe pursuit was given up
Only Behrman persisted
He had made up his mind to bring Dyke in
Hesucceeded in arousing the same degree of determination in Delaneybynow trusted aide of the Railroadand of his own cousin realestate broker named Christian who knew the mountains and had once beenmarshal of Visalia in the old stockraising days
These two went intothe Sierras accompanied by two hired deputies and carrying with them amonths provisions and two of the bloodhounds loaned by the Santa Clarasheriff
On certain Sunday few days after the departure of Christian andDelaney Annixter who had been reading David Copperfield in hishammock on the porch of the ranch house put down the book and went tofind Hilma who was helping Louisa Vacca set the table for dinner
Hefound her in the diningroom her hands full of the goldbordered chinaplates only used on special occasions and which Louisa was forbidden totouch
His wife was more than ordinarily pretty that day
She wore dress offlowered organdie over pink sateen with pink ribbons about her waist andneck and on her slim feet the low shoes she always affected with theirsmart bright buckles
Her thick brown sweetsmelling hair washeaped high upon her head and set off with bow of black velvet andunderneath the shadow of its coils her wideopen eyes rimmed withthe thin black line of her lashes shone continually reflectingthe sunlight
Marriage had only accentuated the beautiful maturity ofHilmas figurenow no longer precociousdefining the single deepswell from her throat to her waist the strong fine amplitude of herhips the sweet feminine undulation of her neck and shoulders
Hercheeks were pink with health and her large round arms carried thepiledup dishes with never tremour
Annixter observant enough wherehis wife was concerned noted how the reflection of the white china set aglow of pale light underneath her chin
Hilma he said Ive been wondering lately about things
Were soblamed happy ourselves it wont do for us to forget about other peoplewho are down will it
Might change our luck
And Im just likely toforget that way too
Its my natureHis wife looked up at him joyfully
Here was the new Annixtercertainly
In all this hullabaloo about Dyke he went on theres some one nobodyaint thought about at all
Thats MRS Dykeand the little tad
Iwouldnt be surprised if they were in hole over there
What do yousay we drive over to the hop ranch after dinner and see if she wantsanythingHilma put down the plates and came around the table and kissed himwithout word
As soon as their dinner was over Annixter had the carryall hitchedup and dispensing with young Vacca drove over to the hop ranch withHilma
Hilma could not keep back the tears as they passed through thelamentable desolation of the withered brown vines symbols of perishedhopes and abandoned effort and Annixter swore between his teeth
Though the wheels of the carryall grated loudly on the roadway in frontof the house nobody came to the door nor looked from the windows
Theplace seemed tenantless infinitely lonely infinitely sad
Annixtertied the team and with Hilma approached the wideopen door scufflingand tramping on the porch to attract attention
Nobody stirred
Sundaystillness pervaded the place
Outside the withered hopleaves rustledlike dry paper in the breeze
The quiet was ominous
They peered intothe front room from the doorway Hilma holding her husbands hand
MrsDyke was there
She sat at the table in the middle of the room herhead with its white hair down upon her arm
clutter of unwasheddishes were strewed over the red and white tablecloth
The unkempt roomonce marvel of neatness had not been cleaned for days
NewspapersGenslingers extras and copies of San Francisco and Los Angeles dailieswere scattered all over the room
On the table itself were crumpledyellow telegrams dozen of them score of them blowing about in thedraught from the door
And in the midst of all this disarray surroundedby the published accounts of her sons crime the telegraphed answersto her pitiful appeals for tidings fluttering about her head thehighwaymans mother worn out abandoned and forgotten slept throughthe stillness of the Sunday afternoon
Neither Hilma nor Annixter ever forgot their interview with Mrs Dykethat day
Suddenly waking she had caught sight of Annixter and at onceexclaimed eagerlyIs there any newsFor long time afterwards nothing could be got from her
She was numbto all other issues than the one question of Dykes capture
She did notanswer their questions nor reply to their offers of assistance
Hilmaand Annixter conferred together without lowering their voices at hervery elbow while she looked vacantly at the floor drawing one handover the other in persistent maniacal gesture
From time to time shewould start suddenly from her chair her eyes wide and as if all atonce realising Annixters presence would cry outIs there any newsWhere is Sidney Mrs Dyke asked Hilma for the fourth time
Is shewell
Is she taken care ofHeres the last telegram said Mrs Dyke in loud monotonous voice
See it says there is no news
He didnt do it she moaned rockingherself back and forth drawing one hand over the other he didnt doit he didnt do it he didnt do it
dont know where he isWhen at last she came to herself it was with flood of tears
Hilmaput her arms around the poor old woman as she bowed herself again uponthe table sobbing and weeping
Oh my son my son she cried my own boy my only son
If couldhave died for you to have prevented this
remember him when he waslittle
Such splendid little fellow so brave so loving with neveran unkind thought never mean action
So it was all his life
We werenever apart
It was always dear little son and dear mammy betweenusnever once was he unkind and he loved me and was the gentlestson to me
And he was GOOD man
He is now he is now
They dontunderstand him
They are not even sure that he did this
He nevermeant it
They dont know my son
Why he wouldnt have hurt kitten
Everybody loved him
He was driven to it
They hounded him down theywouldnt let him alone
He was not right in his mind
They hounded himto it she cried fiercely they hounded him to it
They drove him andgoaded him till he couldnt stand it any longer and now they mean tokill him for turning on them
They are hunting him with dogs nightafter night have stood on the porch and heard the dogs baying far off
They are tracking my boy with dogs like wild animal
May God neverforgive them She rose to her feet terrible her white hair unbound
May God punish them as they deserve may they never prosperon myknees shall pray for it every nightmay their money be curse tothem may their sons their firstborn only sons be taken from them intheir youthBut Hilma interrupted begging her to be silent to be quiet
The tearscame again then and the choking sobs
Hilma took her in her arms
Oh my little boy my little boy she cried
My only son all that Ihad to have come to this
He was not right in his mind or he would haveknown it would break my heart
Oh my son my son if could have diedfor youSidney came in clinging to her dress weeping imploring her not tocry protesting that they never could catch her papa that he would comeback soon
Hilma took them both the little child and the brokendownold woman in the great embrace of her strong arms and they all threesobbed together
Annixter stood on the porch outside his back turned looking straightbefore him into the wilderness of dead vines his teeth shut hard hislower lip thrust out
hope Behrman is satisfied with all this he muttered
hope heis satisfied now damn his soulAll at once an idea occurred to him
He turned about and reentered theroom
Mrs Dyke he began want you and Sidney to come over and live atQuien Sabe
knowyou cant make me believe that the reporters andofficers and officious busyfaces that pretend to offer help just so asthey can satisfy their curiosity arent nagging you to death
want youto let me take care of you and the little tad till all this trouble ofyours is over with
Theres plenty of place for you
You can have thehouse my wifes people used to live in
Youve got to look these thingsin the face
What are you going to do to get along
You must be veryshort of money
Behrman will foreclose on you and take the wholeplace in little while now
want you to let me help you let Hilmaand me be good friends to you
It would be privilegeMrs Dyke tried bravely to assume her pride insisting that she couldmanage but her spirit was broken
The whole affair ended unexpectedlywith Annixter and Hilma bringing Dykes mother and little girl back toQuien Sabe in the carryall
Mrs Dyke would not take with her stick of furniture nor singleornament
It would only serve to remind her of vanished happiness
Shepacked few clothes of her own and Sidneys in little trunk Hilmahelping her and Annixter stowed the trunk under the carryalls backseat
Mrs Dyke turned the key in the door of the house and Annixterhelped her to her seat beside his wife
They drove through the searbrown hop vines
At the angle of the road Mrs Dyke turned around andlooked back at the ruin of the hop ranch the roof of the house justshowing above the trees
She never saw it again
As soon as Annixter and Hilma were alone after their return to QuienSabeMrs Dyke and Sidney having been installed in the Trees oldhouseHilma threw her arms around her husbands neck
Fine she exclaimed oh it was fine of you dear to think of themand to be so good to them
My husband is such GOOD man
So unselfish
You wouldnt have thought of being kind to Mrs Dyke and Sidney littlewhile ago
You wouldnt have thought of them at all
But you did nowand its just because you love me true isnt it
Isnt it
And becauseits made you better man
Im so proud and glad to think its so
Itis so isnt it
Just because you love me trueYou bet it is Hilma he told her
As Hilma and Annixter were sitting down to the supper which they foundwaiting for them Louisa Vacca came to the door of the diningroomto say that Harran Derrick had telephoned over from Los Muertos forAnnixter and had left word for him to ring up Los Muertos as soon as hecame in
He said it was important added Louisa Vacca
Maybe they have news from Washington suggested Hilma
Annixter would not wait to have supper but telephoned to Los Muertosat once
Magnus answered the call
There was special meeting of theExecutive Committee of the League summoned for the next day he toldAnnixter
It was for the purpose of considering the new grain tariffprepared by the Railroad Commissioners
Lyman had written that theschedule of this tariff had just been issued that he had not been ableto construct it precisely according to the wheatgrowers wishesand that he himself would come down to Los Muertos and explain itsapparent discrepancies
Magnus said Lyman would be present at thesession
Annixter curious for details forbore nevertheless to question
Theconnection from Los Muertos to Quien Sabe was made through Bonnevilleand in those troublesome times no one could be trusted
It could notbe known who would overhear conversations carried on over the lines
He assured Magnus that he would be on hand
The time for the Committeemeeting had been set for seven oclock in the evening in order toaccommodate Lyman who wrote that he would be down on the evening trainbut would be compelled by pressure of business to return to the cityearly the next morning
At the time appointed the men composing the Committee gathered aboutthe table in the diningroom of the Los Muertos ranch house
It wasalmost reproduction of the scene of the famous evening when Ostermanhad proposed the plan of the Ranchers Railroad Commission
MagnusDerrick sat at the head of the table in his buttoned frock coat
Whiskey bottles and siphons of sodawater were within easy reach
Presley who by now was considered the confidential friend of everymember of the Committee lounged as before on the sofa smokingcigarettes the cat Nathalie on his knee
Besides Magnus and AnnixterOsterman was present and old Broderson and Harran Garnet from theRuby Rancho and Gethings of the San Pablo who were also members of theExecutive Committee were on hand preoccupied bearded men smokingblack cigars and last of all Dabney the silent old man of whomlittle was known but his name and who had been made member of theCommittee nobody could tell why
My son Lyman should be here gentlemen within at least ten minutes
have sent my team to meet him at Bonneville explained Magnus as hecalled the meeting to order
The Secretary will call the rollOsterman called the roll and to fill in the time read over theminutes of the previous meeting
The treasurer was making his report asto the funds at the disposal of the League when Lyman arrived
Magnus and Harran went forward to meet him and the Committee ratherawkwardly rose and remained standing while the three exchangedgreetings the members some of whom had never seen their commissionereyeing him out of the corners of their eyes
Lyman was dressed with his usual correctness
His cravat was of thelatest fashion his clothes of careful design and unimpeachable fit
Hisshoes of patent leather reflected the lamplight and he carried adrab overcoat over his arm
Before being introduced to the Committee heexcused himself moment and ran to see his mother who waited for himin the adjoining sittingroom
But in few moments he returned askingpardon for the delay
He was all affability his protruding eyes that gave such an unusualforeign appearance to his very dark face radiated geniality
He wasevidently anxious to please to produce good impression upon thegrave clumsy farmers before whom he stood
But at the same timePresley watching him from his place on the sofa could imagine that hewas rather nervous
He was too nimble in his cordiality and the littlegestures he made in bringing his cuffs into view and in touching theends of his tight black mustache with the ball of his thumb wererepeated with unnecessary frequency
Broderson my son Lyman my eldest son
Mr Annixter my sonLymanThe Governor introduced him to the ranchers proud of Lymans goodlooks his correct dress his ease of manner
Lyman shook hands allaround keeping up flow of small talk finding new phrase for eachmember complimenting Osterman whom he already knew upon his talentfor organisation recalling mutual acquaintance to the mind of oldBroderson
At length however he sat down at the end of the tableopposite his brother
There was silence
Magnus rose to recapitulate the reasons for the extra session of theCommittee stating again that the Board of Railway Commissioners whichtheythe ranchershad succeeded in seating had at length issued thenew schedule of reduced rates and that Mr Derrick had been obligingenough to offer to come down to Los Muertos in person to acquaint thewheatgrowers of the San Joaquin with the new rates for the carriage oftheir grain
But Lyman very politely protested addressing his father punctiliouslyas Mr
Chairman and the other ranchers as Gentlemen of the ExecutiveCommittee of the League He had no wish he said to disarrange theregular proceedings of the Committee
Would it not be preferable todefer the reading of his report till new business was called for
In the meanwhile let the Committee proceed with its usual work
Heunderstood the necessarily delicate nature of this work and would bepleased to withdraw till the proper time arrived for him to speak
Good deal of backing and filling about the reading of column offigures muttered Annixter to the man at his elbow
Lyman awaited the Committees decision He sat down touching the endsof his mustache
Oh play ball growled Annixter
Gethings rose to say that as the meeting had been called solely for thepurpose of hearing and considering the new grain tariff he was of theopinion that routine business could be dispensed with and the scheduleread at once
It was so ordered
Lyman rose and made long speech
Voluble as Osterman himself henevertheless had at his command vast number of readymade phrasesthe staples of political speaker the stock in trade of the commerciallawyer which rolled off his tongue with the most persuasive fluency
By degrees in the course of his speech he began to insinuate the ideathat the wheatgrowers had never expected to settle their difficultieswith the Railroad by the work of single commission that theyhad counted upon long continued campaign of many years railwaycommission succeeding railway commission before the desired low ratesshould be secured that the present Board of Commissioners was only thebeginning and that too great results were not expected from them
Allthis he contrived to mention casually in the talk as if it were aforegone conclusion matter understood by all
As the speech continued the eyes of the ranchers around the table werefixed with growing attention upon this welldressed citybred youngman who spoke so fluently and who told them of their own intentions
Afeeling of perplexity began to spread and the first taint of distrustinvaded their minds
But the good work has been most auspiciously inaugurated continuedLyman
Reforms so sweeping as the one contemplated cannot beaccomplished in single night
Great things grow slowly benefits tobe permanent must accrue gradually
Yet in spite of all this yourcommissioners have done much
Already the phalanx of the enemyis pierced already his armour is dinted
Pledged as were yourcommissioners to an average ten per cent
reduction in rates for thecarriage of grain by the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad we haverigidly adhered to the demands of our constituency we have obeyed thePeople
The main problem has not yet been completely solved that isfor later when we shall have gathered sufficient strength to attack theenemy in his very stronghold BUT AN AVERAGE TEN PER CENT
CUT HAS BEENMADE ALL OVER THE STATE
We have made great advance have taken agreat step forward and if the work is carried ahead upon the lineslaid down by the present commissioners and their constituents thereis every reason to believe that within very few years equitable andstable rates for the shipment of grain from the San Joaquin Valley toStockton Port Costa and tidewater will be permanently imposedWell hold on exclaimed Annixter out of order and ignoring theGovernors reproof hasnt your commission reduced grain rates in theSan JoaquinWe have reduced grain rates by ten per cent
all over the State rejoined Lyman
Here are copies of the new scheduleHe drew them from his valise and passed them around the table
You see he observed the rate between Mayfield and Oakland forinstance has been reduced by twentyfive cents tonYesbutbut said old Broderson it is rather unusual isnt itfor wheat in that district to be sent to Oakland Why look here exclaimed Annixter looking up from the schedule where is there anyreduction in rates in the San Joaquinfrom Bonneville and Guadalajarafor instance
dont see as youve made any reduction at all
Is thisright
Did you give me the right scheduleOf course ALL the points in the State could not be covered at once returned Lyman
We never expected you know that we could cut rates inthe San Joaquin the very first move that is for later
But you will seewe made very material reductions on shipments from the upper SacramentoValley also the rate from Ione to Marysville has been reduced eightycents tonWhy rot cried Annixter no one ever ships wheat that wayThe Salinas rate continued Lyman has been lowered seventyfivecents the St Helena rate fifty cents and please notice the verydrastic cut from Red Bluff north along the Oregon route to the OregonState LineWhere not carload of wheat is shipped in year commented Gethingsof the San Pablo
Oh you will find yourself mistaken there Mr Gethings returnedLyman courteously
And for the matter of that low rate wouldstimulate wheatproduction in that districtThe order of the meeting was broken up neglected Magnus did not evenpretend to preside
In the growing excitement over the inexplicableschedule routine was not thought of
Every one spoke at will
Why Lyman demanded Magnus looking across the table to his son isthis schedule correct
You have not cut rates in the San Joaquin at all
Wethese gentlemen here and myself we are no better off than we werebefore we secured your election as commissionerWe were pledged to make an average ten per cent
cut sir It ISan average ten per cent
cut cried Osterman
Oh yes thats plain
Its an average ten per cent
cut all right but youve made it bycutting grain rates between points where practically no grain isshipped
We the wheatgrowers in the San Joaquin where all the wheatis grown are right where we were before
The Railroad wont lose anickel
By Jingo boys he glanced around the table Id like to knowwhat this meansThe Railroad if you come to that returned Lyman has already lodgeda protest against the new rateAnnixter uttered derisive shout
Thats good that is
When the and objects to ratesit dont protest son
The first you hear from Mr Shelgrim isan injunction from the courts preventing the order for new rates fromtaking effect
By the Lord he cried angrily leaping to his feet Iwould like to know what all this means too
Why didnt you reduce ourgrain rates
What did we elect you forYes what did we elect you for demanded Osterman and Gethings alsogetting to their feet
Order order gentlemen cried Magnus remembering the duties of hisoffice and rapping his knuckles on the table
This meeting has beenallowed to degenerate too far alreadyYou elected us declared Lyman doggedly to make an average tenper cent
cut on grain rates
We have done it
Only because you dontbenefit at once you object
It makes difference whose ox is gored itseemsLymanIt was Magnus who spoke
He had drawn himself to his full six feet
Hiseyes were flashing direct into his sons
His voice rang with severity
Lyman what does this meanThe other spread out his hands
As you see sir
We have done our best
warned you not to expect toomuch
told you that this question of transportation was difficult
You would not wish to put rates so low that the action would amount toconfiscation of propertyWhy did you not lower rates in the valley of the San JoaquinThat was not PROMINENT issue in the affair responded Lymancarefully emphasising his words
understand of course it was tobe approached IN TIME
The main point was AN AVERAGE TEN PER CENT
Rates WILL be lowered in the San Joaquin
The ranchers aroundBonneville will be able to ship to Port Costa at equitable rates but soradical measure as that cannot be put through in turn of the hand
We must studyYou KNEW the San Joaquin rate was an issue shouted Annixter shakinghis finger across the table
What do we men who backed you care aboutrates up in Del Norte and Siskiyou Counties
Not whoop in hell
It wasthe San Joaquin rate we were fighting for and we elected you to reducethat
You didnt do it and you dont intend to and by the Lord HarryI want to know whyYoull know sir began Lyman
Well Ill tell you why vociferated Osterman
Ill tell you why
Its because we have been sold out
Its because the and havehad their spoon in this boiling
Its because our commissioners havebetrayed us
Its because were set of damn fool farmers and have beencinched againLyman paled under his dark skin at the direct attack
He evidently hadnot expected this so soon
For the fraction of one instant he lost hispoise
He strove to speak but caught his breath stammering
What have you to say then cried Harran who until now had notspoken
have this to say answered Lyman making head as best he mightthat this is no proper spirit in which to discuss business
TheCommission has fulfilled its obligations
It has adjusted rates tothe best of its ability
We have been at work for two months on thepreparation of this scheduleThats lie shouted Annixter his face scarlet thats lie
Thatschedule was drawn in the offices of the Pacific and Southwestern andyou know it
Its scheme of rates made for the Railroad and by theRailroad and you were bought over to put your name to itThere was concerted outburst at the words
All the men in the roomwere on their feet gesticulating and vociferating
Gentlemen gentlemen cried Magnus are we schoolboys are weruffians of the streetWere set of fool farmers and weve been betrayed cried Osterman
Well what have you to say
What have you to say persisted Harranleaning across the table toward his brother
For Gods sake Lymanyouve got SOME explanationYouve misunderstood protested Lyman white and trembling
Youve expected too much
Next yearnext yearsoonnow the Commission will take up thethe Commission will consider theSan Joaquin rate
Weve done our best that is allHave you sir demanded Magnus
The Governors head was in whirl sensation almost of faintnesshad seized upon him
Was it possible
Was it possible
Have you done your best For second he compelled Lymans eye
The glances of father and son met and in spite of his best effortsLymans eyes wavered
He began to protest once more explaining thematter over again from the beginning
But Magnus did not listen
Inthat brief lapse of time he was convinced that the terrible thing hadhappened that the unbelievable had come to pass
It was in the air
Between father and son in some subtle fashion the truth that was alie stood suddenly revealed
But even then Magnus would not receive it
Lyman do this
His son his eldest son descend to this
Once more andfor the last time he turned to him and in his voice there was that ringthat compelled silence
Lyman he said adjure youII demand of you as you are my sonand an honourable man explain yourself
What is there behind all this
It is no longer as Chairman of the Committee speak to you you amember of the Railroad Commission
It is your father who speaks and Iaddress you as my son
Do you understand the gravity of this crisisdo you realise the responsibility of your position do you not see theimportance of this moment
Explain yourselfThere is nothing to explainYou have not reduced rates in the San Joaquin
You have not reducedrates between Bonneville and tidewaterI repeat sir what said before
An average ten per cent
cutLyman answer me yes or no
Have you reduced the Bonneville rateIt could not be done so soon
Give us time
WeYes or no
By God sir do you dare equivocate with me
Yes or no haveyou reduced the Bonneville rateNoAnd answer ME shouted Harran leaning far across the table answerME
Were you paid by the Railroad to leave the San Joaquin rateuntouchedLyman whiter than ever turned furious upon his brother
Dont you dare put that question to me againNo wont cried Harran because Ill TELL you to your villainsface that you WERE paid to do itOn the instant the clamour burst forth afresh
Still on their feet theranchers had little by little worked around the table Magnus alonekeeping his place
The others were in group before Lyman crowdinghim as it were to the wall shouting into his face with menacinggestures
The truth that was lie the certainty of trust betrayed apledge ruthlessly broken was plain to every one of them
By the Lord
men have been shot for less than this cried Osterman
Youve sold us out you and if you ever bring that dago face of yourson level with mine again Ill slap itKeep your hands off exclaimed Lyman quickly the aggressiveness ofthe cornered rat flaming up within him
No violence
Dont you go toofarHow much were you paid
How much were you paid vociferated Harran
Yes yes what was your price cried the others
They were besidethemselves with anger their words came harsh from between their setteeth their gestures were made with their fists clenched
You know the Commission acted in good faith retorted Lyman
You knowthat all was fair and above boardLiar shouted Annixter liar bribeeater
You were bought and paidfor and with the words his arm seemed almost of itself to leap outfrom his shoulder
Lyman received the blow squarely in the face and theforce of it sent him staggering backwards toward the wall
He trippedover his valise and fell half way his back supported against the closeddoor of the room
Magnus sprang forward
His son had been struck andthe instincts of father rose up in instant protest rose for momentthen forever died away in his heart
He checked the words that flashedto his mind
He lowered his upraised arm
No he had but one son
The poor staggering creature with the fine clothes white face andbloodstreaked lips was no longer his
blow could not dishonour himmore than he had dishonoured himself
But Gethings the older man intervened pulling Annixter back cryingStop this wont do
Not before his fatherI am no father to this man gentlemen exclaimed Magnus
From now onI have but one son
You sir he turned to Lyman you sir leave myhouseLyman his handkerchief to his lips his smart cravat in disarraycaught up his hat and coat
He was shaking with fury his protrudingeyes were bloodshot
He swung open the door
Ruffians he shouted from the threshold ruffians bullies
Do yourown dirty business yourselves after this
Im done with you
How is itall of sudden you talk about honour
How is it that all at once youreso clean and straight
You werent so particular at Sacramento justbefore the nominations
How was the Board elected
Im bribeeateram
Is it any worse than GIVING bribe
Ask Magnus Derrick what hethinks about that
Ask him how much he paid the Democratic bosses atSacramento to swing the conventionHe went out slamming the door
Presley followed
The whole affair made him sick at heart filled himwith infinite disgust infinite weariness
He wished to get away from itall
He left the diningroom and the excited clamouring men behind himand stepped out on the porch of the ranch house closing the door behindhim
Lyman was nowhere in sight
Presley was alone
It was late andafter the lampheated air of the diningroom the coolness of the nightwas delicious and its vast silence after the noise and fury of thecommittee meeting descended from the stars like benediction
Presleystepped to the edge of the porch looking off to southward
And there before him mile after mile illimitable covering the earthfrom horizon to horizon lay the Wheat
The growth now many days oldwas already high from the ground
There it lay vast silent oceanshimmering pallid green under the moon and under the stars mightyforce the strength of nations the life of the world
There in thenight under the dome of the sky it was growing steadily
To Presleysmind the scene in the room he had just left dwindled to paltryinsignificance before this sight
Ah yes the Wheatit was over thisthat the Railroad the ranchers the traitor false to his trust allthe members of an obscure conspiracy were wrangling
As if humanagency could affect this colossal power
What were these heated tinysquabbles this feverish small bustle of mankind this minute swarmingof the human insect to the great majestic silent ocean of the Wheatitself
Indifferent gigantic resistless it moved in its appointedgrooves
Men Liliputians gnats in the sunshine buzzed impudently intheir tiny battles were born lived through their little day died andwere forgotten while the Wheat wrapped in Nirvanic calm grew steadilyunder the night alone with the stars and with God
CHAPTER VJackrabbits were pest that year and Presley occasionally foundamusement in hunting them with Harrans halfdozen greyhounds followingthe chase on horseback
One day between two and three months afterLyman visit to Los Muertos as he was returning toward the ranch housefrom distant and lonely quarter of Los Muertos he came unexpectedlyupon strange sight
Some twenty men Annixters and Ostermans tenants and small ranchersfrom east of Guadalajaraall members of the Leaguewere going throughthe manual of arms under Harran Derricks supervision
They were allequipped with new Winchester rifles
Harran carried one of these himselfand with it he illustrated the various commands he gave
As soon as oneof the men under his supervision became more than usually proficient hewas told off to instruct file of the more backward
After the manualof arms Harran gave the command to take distance as skirmishers andwhen the line had opened out so that some halfdozen feet intervenedbetween each man an advance was made across the field the men stoopinglow and snapping the hammers of their rifles at an imaginary enemy
The League had its agents in San Francisco who watched the movementsof the Railroad as closely as was possible and some time before thisAnnixter had received word that the Marshal and his deputies were comingdown to Bonneville to put the dummy buyers of his ranch in possession
The report proved to be but the first of many false alarms but ithad stimulated the League to unusual activity and some three or fourhundred men were furnished with arms and from time to time were drilledin secret
Among themselves the ranchers said that if the Railroad managers didnot believe they were terribly in earnest in the stand they had takenthey were making fatal mistake
Harran reasserted this statement to Presley on the way home to theranch house that same day
Harran had caught up with him by the time hereached the Lower Road and the two jogged homeward through the miles ofstanding wheat
They may jump the ranch Pres he said if they try hard enough butthey will never do it while am alive
By the way he added you knowwe served notices yesterday upon Behrman and Cy
Ruggles to quit thecountry
Of course they wont do it but they wont be able to say theydidnt have warningAbout an hour later the two reached the ranch house but as Harran rodeup the driveway he uttered an exclamation
Hello he said something is up
Thats Genslingers buckboardIn fact the editors team was tied underneath the shade of gianteucalyptus tree near by
Harran uneasy under this unexpected visit ofthe enemys friend dismounted without stabling his horse and went atonce to the diningroom where visitors were invariably received
Butthe diningroom was empty and his mother told him that Magnus andthe editor were in the office Magnus had said they were not to bedisturbed
Earlier in the afternoon the editor had driven up to the porch and hadasked Mrs Derrick whom he found reading book of poems on the porchif he could see Magnus
At the time the Governor had gone with Phelpsto inspect the condition of the young wheat on Hoovens holding butwithin half an hour he returned and Genslinger had asked him for fewmoments talk in privateThe two went into the office Magnus locking the door behind him
Very complete you are here Governor observed the editor in hisalert jerky manner his black beadlike eyes twinkling around the roomfrom behind his glasses
Telephone safe ticker accountbookswellthats progress isnt it
Only way to manage big ranch these days
But the day of the big ranch is over
As the land appreciates in valuethe temptation to sell off small holdings will be too strong
And thenthe small holding can be cultivated to better advantage
shall have aneditorial on that some dayThe cost of maintaining number of small holdings said Magnusindifferently is of course greater than if they were all under onemanagementThat may be that may be rejoined the other
There was long pause
Genslinger leaned back in his chair and rubbeda knee
Magnus standing erect in front of the safe waited for him tospeak
This is an unfortunate business Governor began the editor thismisunderstanding between the ranchers and the Railroad
wish it couldbe adjusted
HERE are two industries that MUST be in harmony with oneanother or we all go to potI should prefer not to be interviewed on the subject Mr Genslinger said Magnus
Oh no oh no
Lord love you Governor dont want to interview you
We all know how you standAgain there was long silence
Magnus wondered what this little manusually so garrulous could want of him
At length Genslinger beganagain
He did not look at Magnus except at long intervals
About the present Railroad Commission he remarked
That was aninteresting campaign you conducted in Sacramento and San FranciscoMagnus held his peace his hands shut tight
Did Genslinger know ofLymans disgrace
Was it for this he had come
Would the story of it bethe leading article in tomorrows Mercury
An interesting campaign repeated Genslinger slowly veryinteresting campaign
watched it with every degree of interest
sawits every phase Mr DerrickThe campaign was not without its interest admitted Magnus
Yes said Genslinger still more deliberately and some phases of itweremore interesting than others as for instance let us say theway in which youpersonallysecured the votes of certain chairmen ofdelegationsNEED particularise further
Yes those menthe wayyou got their votes
Now THAT should say Mr Derrick was the mostinteresting move in the whole gameto you
Hm curious he murmuredmusingly
Lets see
You deposited two onethousand dollar bills andfour fivehundred dollar bills in boxthree hundred and eight wasthe numberin box in the Safety Deposit Vaults in San Francisco andthenlets see you gave key to this box to each of the gentlemenin question and after the election the box was empty
Now call thatinterestingcurious because its new safe and highly ingeniousmethod of bribery
How did you happen to think of it GovernorDo you know what you are doing sir Magnus burst forth
Do you knowwhat you are insinuating here in my own houseWhy Governor returned the editor blandly Im not INSINUATINGanything
Im talking about what KNOWIts lieGenslinger rubbed his chin reflectively
Well he answered you can have chance to prove it before the GrandJury if you want toMy character is known all over the State blustered Magnus
Mypolitics are pure politics
MyNo one needs better reputation for pure politics than the man whosets out to be briber interrupted Genslinger and might as welltell you Governor that you cant shout me down
can put my handon the two chairmen you bought before its dark today
Ive had theirdepositions in my safe for the last six weeks
We could make the arreststomorrow if we wanted
Governor you sure did risky thing when youwent into that Sacramento fight an awful risky thing
Some men canafford to have bribery charges preferred against them and it dont hurtone little bit but YOULord it would BUST you Governor bust youdead
know all about the whole shananigan business from to andif you dont believe ithere he drew long strip of paper from hispocket heres galley proof of the storyMagnus took it in his hands
There under his eyes scareheadeddoubleleaded the more important clauses printed in bold type was thedetailed account of the deal Magnus had made with the two delegates
It was pitiless remorseless bald
Every statement was substantiatedevery statistic verified with Genslingers meticulous love forexactness
Besides all that it had the ring of truth
It was exposureruin absolute annihilation
Thats about correct isnt it commented Genslinger as Derrickfinished reading
Magnus did not reply
think it is correct enough the editor continued
But thought it would only be fair to you to letyou see it before it was publishedThe one thought uppermost in Derricks mind his one impulse of themoment was at whatever cost to preserve his dignity not to allowthis man to exult in the sight of one quiver of weakness one trace ofdefeat one suggestion of humiliation
By an effort that put all hisiron rigidity to the test he forced himself to look straight intoGenslingers eyes
congratulate you he observed handing back the proof upon yourjournalistic enterprise
Your paper will sell tomorrow Oh Idont know as want to publish this story remarked the editorindifferently putting away the galley
Im just like that
The funfor me is running good story to earth but once Ive got it loseinterest
And then wouldnt like to see youholding the positionyou do President of the League and leading man of the countyIwouldnt like to see story like this smash you over
Its worthmore to you to keep it out of print than for me to put it in
Ive gotnothing much to gain but few extra editions but youLord you wouldlose everything
Your committee was in the deal right enough
But yourLeague all the San Joaquin Valley everybody in the State believes thecommissioners were fairly electedYour story suddenly exclaimed Magnus struck with an idea willbe thoroughly discredited just so soon as the new grain tariff ispublished
have means of knowing that the San Joaquin ratethe issueupon which the board was electedis not to be touched
Is it likely theranchers would secure the election of board that plays them falseOh we know all about that answered Genslinger smiling
You thoughtyou were electing Lyman easily
You thought you had got the Railroad towalk right into your trap
You didnt understand how you could pull offyour deal so easily
Why Governor LYMAN WAS PLEDGED TO THE RAILROADTWO YEARS AGO
He was THE ONE PARTICULAR man the corporation wanted forcommissioner
And your people elected himsaved the Railroad all thetrouble of campaigning for him
And you cant make any counter chargeof bribery there
No sir the corporation dont use such amateurishmethods as that
Confidentially and between us two all that theRailroad has done for Lyman in order to attach him to their interestsis to promise to back him politically in the next campaign for Governor
Its too bad he continued dropping his voice and changing hisposition
It really is too bad to see good men trying to bunt stonewall over with their bare heads
You couldnt have won at any stage ofthe game
wish could have talked to you and your friends before youwent into that Sacramento fight
could have told you then how littlechance you had
When will you people realise that you cant buck againstthe Railroad
Why Magnus its like me going out in paper boat andshooting peas at battleshipIs that all you wished to see me about Mr Genslinger remarkedMagnus bestirring himself
am rather occupied today Well returned the other you know what the publication of this article wouldmean for you He paused again took off his glasses breathed on thempolished the lenses with his handkerchief and readjusted them on hisnose
Ive been thinking Governor he began again with renewedalertness and quite irrelevantly of enlarging the scope of theMercury
You see Im midway between the two big centres of the StateSan Francisco and Los Angeles and want to extend the Mercuryssphere of influence as far up and down the valley as can
want toillustrate the paper
You see if had photoengraving plant ofmy own could do good deal of outside jobbing as well and theinvestment would pay ten per cent
But it takes money to make money
wouldnt want to put in any dinky onehorse affair
want goodplant
Ive been figuring out the business
Besides the plant therewould be the expense of high grade paper
Cant print halftones onanything but coated paper and that COSTS
Well what with this and withthat and running expenses till the thing began to pay it would costme about ten thousand dollars and was wondering if perhaps youcouldnt see your way clear to accommodating meTen thousandYes
Say five thousand down and the balance within sixty daysMagnus for the moment blind to what Genslinger had in mind turned onhim in astonishment
Why man what security could you give me for such an amountWell to tell the truth answered the editor hadnt thought muchabout securities
In fact believed you would see how greatly it wasto your advantage to talk business with me
You see Im not going toprint this article about you Governor and Im not going to let it getout so as any one else can print it and it seems to me that one goodturn deserves another
You understandMagnus understood
An overwhelming desire suddenly took possession ofhim to grip this blackmailer by the throat to strangle him where hestood or if not at least to turn upon him with that oldtime terribleanger before which whole conventions had once cowered
But in the samemoment the Governor realised this was not to be
Only its righteousnesshad made his wrath terrible only the justice of his anger had made himfeared
Now the foundation was gone from under his feet he had knockedit away himself
Three times feeble was he whose quarrel was unjust
Before this country editor this paid speaker of the Railroad he stoodconvicted
The man had him at his mercy
The detected briber could notresent an insult
Genslinger rose smoothing his hat
Well he said of course you want time to think it over and youcant raise money like that on short notice
Ill wait till Friday noonof this week
We begin to set Saturdays paper at about four Fridayafternoon and the forms are locked about two in the morning
hope he added turning back at the door of the room that you wont findanything disagreeable in your Saturday morning Mercury Mr DerrickHe went out closing the door behind him and in moment Magnus heardthe wheels of his buckboard grating on the driveway
The following morning brought letter to Magnus from Gethings of theSan Pueblo ranch which was situated very close to Visalia
The letterwas to the effect that all around Visalia upon the ranches affected bythe regrade of the Railroad men were arming and drilling and that thestrength of the League in that quarter was undoubted
But to refer continued the letter to most painful recollection
You will nodoubt remember that at the close of our last committee meetingspecific charges were made as to fraud in the nomination and electionof one of our commissioners emanating most unfortunately from thecommissioner himself
These charges my dear Mr Derrick were directedat yourself
How the secrets of the committee have been noised aboutI cannot understand
You may be of course assured of my ownunquestioning confidence and loyalty
However regret exceedinglyto state not only that the rumour of the charges referred to above isspreading in this district but that also they are made use of by theenemies of the League
It is to be deplored that some of the Leaguersthemselvesyou know we number in our ranks many small farmersignorant Portuguese and foreignershave listened to these storiesand have permitted feeling of uneasiness to develop among them
Eventhough it were admitted that fraudulent means had been employed in theelections which of course personally do not admit do not thinkit would make very much difference in the confidence which the vastmajority of the Leaguers repose in their chiefs
Yet we have so insistedupon the probity of our position as opposed to Railroad chicanerythat believe it advisable to quell this distant suspicion at once topublish denial of these rumoured charges would only be to give themtoo much importance
However can you not write me letter statingexactly how the campaign was conducted and the commission nominated andelected
could show this to some of the more disaffected and it wouldserve to allay all suspicion on the instant
think it would be wellto write as though the initiative came not from me but from yourselfignoring this present letter
offer this only as suggestion andwill confidently endorse any decision you may arrive atThe letter closed with renewed protestations of confidence
Magnus was alone when he read this
He put it carefully away in thefiling cabinet in his office and wiped the sweat from his forehead andface
He stood for one moment his hands rigid at his sides his fistsclinched
This is piling up he muttered looking blankly at the opposite wall
My God this is piling up
What am to doAh the bitterness of unavailing regret the anguish of compromise withconscience the remorse of bad deed done in moment of excitement
Ah the humiliation of detection the degradation of being caughtcaught like schoolboy pilfering his fellows desks and worsethan all worse than all the consciousness of lost selfrespect theknowledge of prestige vanishing dignity impaired knowledge thatthe grip which held multitude in check was trembling that controlwas wavering that command was being weakened
Then the little tricksto deceive the crowd the little subterfuges the little pretences thatkept up appearances the lies the bluster the pose the strut thegasconade where once was iron authority the turning of the head soas not to see that which could not be prevented the suspicion ofsuspicion the haunting fear of the Man on the Street the uneasinessof the direct glance the questioning as to motiveswhy had this beensaid what was meant by that word that gesture that glance
Wednesday passed and Thursday
Magnus kept to himself seeing novisitors avoiding even his family
How to break through the mesh of thenet how to regain the old position how to prevent discovery
If therewere only some way some vast superhuman effort by which he could risein his old strength once more crushing Lyman with one hand Genslingerwith the other and for one more moment the last to stand supremeagain indomitable the leader then go to his death triumphant at theend his memory untarnished his fame undimmed
But the plaguespotwas in himself knitted forever into the fabric of his being
ThoughGenslinger should be silenced though Lyman should be crushed thougheven the League should overcome the Railroad though he should be theacknowledged leader of resplendent victory yet the plaguespotwould remain
There was no success for him now
However conspicuousthe outward achievement he he himself Magnus Derrick had failedmiserably and irredeemably
Petty material complications intruded sordid considerations
Even ifGenslinger was to be paid where was the money to come from
His legalbattles with the Railroad extending now over period of many yearshad cost him dear his plan of sowing all of Los Muertos to wheatdischarging the tenants had proved expensive the campaign resultingin Lymans election had drawn heavily upon his account
All along hehad been relying upon bonanza crop to reimburse him
It was notbelievable that the Railroad would jump Los Muertos but if thisshould happen he would be left without resources
Ten thousand dollars
Could he raise the amount
But to pay it out to blackmailer
To be held up thus in roadagent fashion without single means ofredress
Would it not cripple him financially
Genslinger could dohis worst
He Magnus would brave it out
Was not his character abovesuspicion
Was it
This letter of Gethingss
Already the murmur of uneasinessmade itself heard
Was this not the thin edge of the wedge
How thepublication of Genslingers story would drive it home
How the spark ofsuspicion would flare into the blaze of open accusation
There would beinvestigations
There was terror in the word
He couldnot stand investigation
Magnus groaned aloud covering his head withhis clasped hands
Briber corrupter of government ballotbox stufferdescending to the level of backroom politicians of barroom heelershe Magnus Derrick statesman of the old school Roman in his ironintegrity abandoning career rather than enter the new politics had in one moment of weakness hazarding all even honour on singlestake taking great chances to achieve great results swept away thework of lifetime
Gambler that he was he had at last chanced his highest stake hispersonal honour in the greatest game of his life and had lost
It was Presleys morbidly keen observation that first noticed theevidence of new trouble in the Governors face and manner
Presley wassure that Lymans defection had not so upset him
The morning after thecommittee meeting Magnus had called Harran and Annie Derrick into theoffice and after telling his wife of Lymans betrayal had forbiddeneither of them to mention his name again
His attitude towards hisprodigal son was that of stern unrelenting resentment
But now Presleycould not fail to detect traces of more deepseated travail
Somethingwas in the wind the times were troublous
What next was about tohappen
What fresh calamity impended
One morning toward the very end of the week Presley woke early in hissmall whitepainted iron bed
He hastened to get up and dress
Therewas much to be done that day
Until late the night before he hadbeen at work on collection of some of his verses gathered from themagazines in which they had first appeared
Presley had received aliberal offer for the publication of these verses in book form
TheToilers was to be included in this book and indeed was to give itits nameThe Toilers and Other Poems Thus it was that until theprevious midnight he had been preparing the collection for publicationrevising annotating arranging
The book was to be sent off thatmorning
But also Presley had received typewritten note from Annixter invitinghim to Quien Sabe that same day
Annixter explained that it was Hilmasbirthday and that he had planned picnic on the high ground of hisranch at the headwaters of Broderson Creek
They were to go in thecarryall Hilma Presley Mrs Dyke Sidney and himself and were tomake day of it
They would leave Quien Sabe at ten in the morning
Presley had at once resolved to go
He was immensely fond ofAnnixtermore so than ever since his marriage with Hilma and theastonishing transformation of his character
Hilma as well wasdelightful as Mrs Annixter and Mrs Dyke and the little tad had alwaysbeen his friends
He would have good time
But nobody was to go into Bonneville that morning with the mail and ifhe wished to send his manuscript he would have to take it in himself
He had resolved to do this getting an early start and going onhorseback to Quien Sabe by way of Bonneville
It was barely six oclock when Presley sat down to his coffee and eggsin the diningroom of Los Muertos
The day promised to be hot andfor the first time Presley had put on new khaki riding suit veryEnglishlooking though in place of the regulation topboots he worehis laced kneeboots with great spur on the left heel
Harran joinedhim at breakfast in his working clothes of blue canvas
He was boundfor the irrigating ditch to see how the work was getting on there
How is the wheat looking asked Presley
Bully answered the other stirring his coffee
The Governor has hadhis usual luck
Practically every acre of the ranch was sown towheat and everywhere the stand is good
was over on Two day beforeyesterday and if nothing happens believe it will go thirty sacksto the acre there
Cutter reports that there are spots on Four where wewill get fortytwo or three
Hooven too brought up some wonderful fineears for me to look at
The grains were just beginning to show
Some ofthe ears carried twenty grains
That means nearly forty bushels of wheatto every acre
call it bonanza yearHave you got any mail said Presley rising
Im going into townHarran shook his head and took himself away and Presley went down tothe stablecorral to get his pony
As he rode out of the stableyard and passed by the ranch house onthe driveway he was surprised to see Magnus on the lowest step of theporch
Good morning Governor called Presley
Arent you up pretty earlyGood morning Pres my boy The Governor came forward and putting hishand on the ponys withers walked along by his side
Going to town Pres he asked
Yes sir
Can do anything for you GovernorMagnus drew sealed envelope from his pocket
wish you would drop in at the office of the Mercury for me he saidand see Mr Genslinger personally and give him this envelope
It is apackage of papers but they involve considerable sum of money andyou must be careful of them
few years ago when our enmity was not sostrong Mr Genslinger and had some business dealings with eachother
thought it as well just now considering that we are so openlyopposed to terminate the whole affair and break off relations
We cameto settlement few days ago
These are the final papers
They must begiven to him in person Presley
You understandPresley cantered on turning into the county road and holding northwardby the mammoth watering tank and Brodersons popular windbreak
As hepassed Carahers he saw the saloonkeeper in the doorway of his placeand waved him salutation which the other returned
By degrees Presley had come to consider Caraher in more favourablelight
He found to his immense astonishment that Caraher knewsomething of Mill and Bakounin not however from their books butfrom extracts and quotations from their writings reprinted in theanarchistic journals to which he subscribed
More than once the two hadheld long conversations and from Carahers own lips Presley heardthe terrible story of the death of his wife who had been accidentallykilled by Pinkertons during demonstration of strikers
It investedthe saloonkeeper in Presleys imagination with all the dignity of thetragedy
He could not blame Caraher for being red He even wonderedhow it was the saloonkeeper had not put his theories into practice andadjusted his ancient wrong with his six inches of plugged gaspipe Presley began to conceive of the man as characterYou wait Mr Presley the saloonkeeper had once said when Presleyhad protested against his radical ideas
You dont know the Railroadyet
Watch it and its doings long enough and youll come over to my wayof thinking tooIt was about halfpast seven when Presley reached Bonneville
Thebusiness part of the town was as yet hardly astir he despatched hismanuscript and then hurried to the office of the Mercury Genslingeras he feared had not yet put in appearance but the janitor of thebuilding gave Presley the address of the editors residence and it wasthere he found him in the act of sitting down to breakfast
Presley washardly courteous to the little man and abruptly refused his offer of adrink
He delivered Magnuss envelope to him and departed
It had occurred to him that it would not do to present himself at QuienSabe on Hilmas birthday emptyhanded and on leaving Genslingershouse he turned his ponys head toward the business part of the townagain pulling up in front of the jewellers just as the clerk wastaking down the shutters
At the jewellers he purchased little brooch for Hilma and at thecigar stand in the lobby of the Yosemite House box of superfinecigars which when it was too late he realised that the masterof Quien Sabe would never smoke holding as he did with defiantinconsistency to miserable weeds black bitter and flagrantlydoctored which he bought three for nickel at Guadalajara
Presley arrived at Quien Sabe nearly half an hour behind the appointedtime but as he had expected the party were in no way ready to start
The carryall its horses covered with white flynets stood under atree near the house young Vacca dozing on the seat
Hilma and Sidneythe latter exuberant with gayety that all but brought the tears toPresleys eyes were making sandwiches on the back porch
Mrs Dyke wasnowhere to be seen and Annixter was shaving himself in his bedroom
This latter put halflathered face out of the window as Presleycantered through the gate and waved his razor with beckoning motion
Come on in Pres he cried
Nobodys ready yet
Youre hours ahead oftimePresley came into the bedroom his huge spur clinking on the strawmatting
Annixter was without coat vest or collar his blue silksuspenders hung in loops over either hip his hair was disordered thecrown lock stiffer than ever
Glad to see you old boy he announced as Presley came in
No dontshake hands Im all lather
Here find chair will you
wont belongI thought you said ten oclock observed Presley sitting down on theedge of the bed
Well did butBut then again in way you didnt hey his friend interrupted
Annixter grunted goodhumouredly and turned to strop his razor
Presleylooked with suspicious disfavour at his suspenders
Why is it he observed that as soon as man is about to getmarried he buys himself pale blue suspenders silk ones
Think of it
You Buck Annixter with skyblue silk suspenders
It ought to be astrap and nailOld fool observed Annixter whose repartee was the heaving of brickbats
Say he continued holding the razor from his face and jerkinghis head over his shoulder while he looked at Presleys reflectionin his mirror say look around
Isnt this nifty little room
Werefitted the whole house you know
Notice shes all paintedI have been looking around answered Presley sweeping the room with aseries of glances
He forebore criticism
Annixter was so boyishly proudof the effect that it would have been unkind to have undeceived him
Presley looked at the marvellous departmentstore bed of brass withits brave gay canopy the millmade washstand with its pitcher andbowl of blinding red and green china the strawframed lithographs ofsymbolic female figures against the multicoloured new wallpaper theinadequate spindle chairs of white and gold the sphere of tissue paperhanging from the gas fixture and the plumes of pampas grass tackedto the wall at artistic angles and overhanging two astonishing oilpaintings in dazzling golden frames
Say how about those paintings Pres inquired Annixter littleuneasily
dont know whether theyre good or not
They were paintedby threefingered Chinaman in Monterey and got the lot for thirtydollars frames thrown in
Why think the frames alone are worththirty dollarsWell so do declared Presley
He hastened to change the subject
Buck he said hear youve brought Mrs Dyke and Sidney to livewith you
You know think thats rather white of youOh rot Pres muttered Annixter turning abruptly to his shaving
And you cant fool me either old man Presley continued
Youregiving this picnic as much for Mrs Dyke and the little tad as you arefor your wife just to cheer them up bitOh pshaw you make me sickWell thats the right thing to do Buck and Im as glad for your sakeas am for theirs
There was time when you would have let them all goto grass and never so much as thought of them
dont want to seem tobe officious but youve changed for the better old man and guessI know why
She Presley caught his friends eye and added gravelyShes good woman BuckAnnixter turned around abruptly his face flushing under its lather
Pres he exclaimed shes made man of me
was machine beforeand if another man or woman or child got in my way rode em downand never DREAMED of anybody else but myself
But as soon as woke upto the fact that really loved her why it was glory hallelujah all ina minute and in way kind of loved everybody then and wanted tobe everybodys friend
And began to see that fellow cant liveFOR himself any more than he can live BY himself
Hes got to think ofothers
If hes got brains hes got to think for the poor ducks thathavent em and not give em boot in the backsides because theyhappen to be stupid and if hes got money hes got to help those thatare busted and if hes got house hes got to think of those thataint got anywhere to go
Ive got whole lot of ideas since beganto love Hilma and just as soon as can Im going to get in and HELPpeople and Im going to keep to that idea the rest of my natural life
That aint much of religion but its the best Ive got and HenryWard Beecher couldnt do any more than that
And its all come aboutbecause of Hilma and because we cared for each otherPresley jumped up and caught Annixter about the shoulders with onearm gripping his hand hard
This absurd figure with dangling silksuspenders lathered chin and tearful eyes seemed to be suddenlyinvested with true nobility
Beside this blundering struggle to doright to help his fellows Presleys own vague schemes glitteringsystems of reconstruction collapsed to ruin and he himself with allhis refinement with all his poetry culture and education stood abungler at the worlds workbench
Youre all RIGHT old man he exclaimed unable to think of anythingadequate
Youre all right
Thats the way to talk and here by theway brought you box of cigarsAnnixter stared as Presley laid the box on the edge of the washstand
Old fool he remarked what in hell did you do that forOh just for funI suppose theyre rotten stinkodoras or you wouldnt give em awayThis cringing gratitude Presley began
Shut up shouted Annixter and the incident was closed
Annixter resumed his shaving and Presley lit cigarette
Any news from Washington he queried
Nothing thats any good grunted Annixter
Hello he added raisinghis head theres somebody in hurry for sureThe noise of horse galloping so fast that the hoofbeats sounded inone uninterrupted rattle abruptly made itself heard
The noise wascoming from the direction of the road that led from the Mission to QuienSabe
With incredible swiftness the hoofbeats drew nearer
There wasthat in their sound which brought Presley to his feet
Annixter threwopen the window
Runaway exclaimed Presley
Annixter with thoughts of the Railroad and the Jumping of the ranchflung his hand to his hip pocket
What is it Vacca he cried
Young Vacca turning in his seat in the carryall was looking up theroad
All at once he jumped from his place and dashed towards thewindow
Dyke he shouted
Dyke its DykeWhile the words were yet in his mouth the sound of the hoofbeats roseto roar and great belltoned voice shoutedAnnixter Annixter AnnixterIt was Dykes voice and the next instant he shot into view in the opensquare in front of the house
Oh my God cried Presley
The exengineer threw the horse on its haunches springing from thesaddle and as he did so the beast collapsed shuddering to theground
Annixter sprang from the window and ran forward Presleyfollowing
There was Dyke hatless his pistol in his hand gaunt terrible figurethe beard immeasurably long the cheeks fallen in the eyes sunken
Hisclothes ripped and torn by weeks of flight and hiding in the chaparralwere ragged beyond words the boots were shreds of leather bloody tothe ankle with furious spurring
Annixter he shouted and again rolling his sunken eyes AnnixterAnnixterHere here cried Annixter
The other turned levelling his pistol
Give me horse give me horse quick do you hear
Give me horseor Ill shootSteady steady
That wont do
You know me Dyke
Were friends hereThe other lowered his weapon
know know he panted
Id forgotten
Im unstrung Mr Annixterand Im running for my life
Theyre not ten minutes behind meCome on come on shouted Annixter dashing stablewards hissuspenders flying
Heres horseMine exclaimed Presley
He wouldnt carry you mileAnnixter was already far ahead trumpeting orders
The buckskin he yelled
Get her out Billy
Wheres the stableman
Get out that buckskin
Get out that saddleThen followed minutes of furious haste Presley Annixter Billy thestableman and Dyke himself darting hither and thither about theyellow mare buckling strapping cinching their lips pale theirfingers trembling with excitement
Want anything to eat Annixters head was under the saddle flap as hetore at the cinch
Want anything to eat
Want any money
Want gunWater returned Dyke
Theyve watched every spring
Im killed withthirstTheres the hydrant
Quick nowI got as far as the Kern River but they turned me back he saidbetween breaths as he drank
Dont stop to talkMy mother and the little tadIm taking care of them
Theyre stopping with meHere
You wont see em by the Lord you wont

God damn it are you going to let him beshot before he can get away
Now Dyke up you go
Shell kill herselfrunning before they can catch youGod bless you Annixter
Wheres the little tad

Tell themYes yes yes
All clear Pres
Let her have her own gait Dyke
Youre on the best horse in the county now
Let go her head Billy
NowDykeshake hands
You bet will
Thats all right
Yes God blessyou
Let her go
Youre OFFAnswering the goad of the spur and already quivering with theexcitement of the men who surrounded her the buckskin cleared thestablecorral in two leaps then gathering her legs under her her headlow her neck stretched out swung into the road from out the drivewaydisappearing in blur of dust
With the agility of monkey young Vacca swung himself into theframework of the artesian well clambering aloft to its very top
Heswept the country with glance
Well demanded Annixter from the ground
The others cocked their headsto listen
see him see him shouted Vacca
Hes going like the devil
Hesheaded for GuadalajaraLook back up the road toward the Mission
Anything thereThe answer came down in shout of apprehension
Theres party of men
Three or fouron horseback
Theres dogs withem
Theyre coming this way
Oh can hear the dogs
And say ohsay theres another party coming down the Lower Road going towardsGuadalajara too
They got guns
can see the shine of the barrels
And oh Lord say theres three more men on horses coming down onthe jump from the hills on the Los Muertos stock range
Theyre makingtowards Guadalajara
And can hear the courthouse bell in Bonnevilleringing
Say the whole county is upAs young Vacca slid down to the ground two small blackandtan houndswith flapping ears and lolling tongues loped into view on the road infront of the house
They were grey with dust their noses were to theground
At the gate where Dyke had turned into the ranch housegrounds they halted in confusion moment
One started to follow thehighwaymans trail towards the stable corral but the other quarteringover the road with lightning swiftness suddenly picked up the newscent leading on towards Guadalajara
He tossed his head in the air andPresley abruptly shut his hands over his ears
Ah that terrible cry
deeptoned reverberating like the bourdon of agreat bell
It was the trackers exulting on the trail of the pursuedthe prolonged raucous howl eager ominous vibrating with the alarm ofthe tocsin sullen with the heavy muffling note of death
But close uponthe bay of the hounds came the gallop of horses
Five men their eyesupon the hounds their rifles across their pommels their horses reekingand black with sweat swept by in storm of dust glinting hoofs andstreaming manes
That was Delaneys gang exclaimed Annixter
saw himThe other was that chap Christian said Vacca
Behrmans cousin
He had two deputies with him and the chap in the white slouch hat wasthe sheriff from VisaliaBy the Lord they arent far behind declared Annixter
As the men turned towards the house again they saw Hilma and Mrs Dykein the doorway of the little house where the latter lived
They werelooking out bewildered ignorant of what had happened
But on theporch of the Ranch house itself alone forgotten in the excitementSidneythe little tadstood with pale face and serious wideopeneyes
She had seen everything and had understood
She said nothing
Herhead inclined towards the roadway she listened to the faint and distantbaying of the dogs
Dyke thundered across the railway tracks by the depot at Guadalajara notfive minutes ahead of his pursuers
Luck seemed to have deserted him
The station usually so quiet was now occupied by the crew of freighttrain that lay on the down track while on the up line near at hand andheaded in the same direction was detached locomotive whose engineerand fireman recognized him he was sure as the buckskin leaped acrossthe rails
He had had no time to formulate plan since that morning whentortured with thirst he had ventured near the spring at the headwatersof Broderson Creek on Quien Sabe and had all but fallen into the handsof the posse that had been watching for that very move
It was uselessnow to regret that he had tried to foil pursuit by turning back onhis tracks to regain the mountains east of Bonneville
Now Delaney wasalmost on him
To distance that posse was the only thing to be thoughtof now
It was no longer question of hiding till pursuit should flagthey had driven him out from the shelter of the mountains down intothis populous countryside where an enemy might be met with at everyturn of the road
Now it was life or death
He would either escape or bekilled
He knew very well that he would never allow himself to be takenalive
But he had no mind to be killedto turn and fighttill escapewas blocked
His one thought was to leave pursuit behind
Weeks of flight had sharpened Dykes every sense
As he turned into theUpper Road beyond Guadalajara he saw the three men galloping down fromDerricks stock range making for the road ahead of him
They would cuthim off there
He swung the buckskin about
He must take the LowerRoad across Los Muertos from Guadalajara and he must reach it beforeDelaneys dogs and posse
Back he galloped the buckskin measuring herlength with every leap
Once more the station came in sight
Rising inhis stirrups he looked across the fields in the direction of the LowerRoad
There was cloud of dust there
From wagon
No horses onthe run and their riders were armed
He could catch the flash of gunbarrels
They were all closing in on him converging on Guadalajara byevery available road
The Upper Road west of Guadalajara led straight toBonneville
That way was impossible
Was he in trap
Had the time forfighting come at last
But as Dyke neared the depot at Guadalajara his eye fell upon thedetached locomotive that lay quietly steaming on the up line and witha thrill of exultation he remembered that he was an engineer born andbred
Delaneys dogs were already to be heard and the roll of hoofs onthe Lower Road was dinning in his ears as he leaped from the buckskinbefore the depot
The train crew scattered like frightened sheep beforehim but Dyke ignored them
His pistol was in his hand as once more onfoot he sprang toward the lone engine
Out of the cab he shouted
Both of you
Quick or Ill kill youbothThe two men tumbled from the iron apron of the tender as Dyke swunghimself up dropping his pistol on the floor of the cab and reachingwith the old instinct for the familiar levers
The great compound hissedand trembled as the steam was released and the huge drivers stirredturning slowly on the tracks
But there was shout
Delaneys possedogs and men swung into view at the turn of the road their figuresleaning over as they took the curve at full speed
Dyke threw everythingwide open and caught up his revolver
From behind came the challenge ofa Winchester
The party on the Lower Road were even closer than Delaney
They had seen his manoeuvre and the first shot of the fight shiveredthe cab windows above the engineers head
But spinning futilely at first the drivers of the engine at last caughtthe rails
The engine moved advanced travelled past the depot andthe freight train and gathering speed rolled out on the track beyond
Smoke black and boiling shot skyward from the stack not joint thatdid not shudder with the mighty strain of the steam but the great ironbruteone of Baldwins newest and bestcame to call obedient anddocile as soon as ever the great pulsing heart of it felt master handupon its levers
It gathered its speed bracing its steel muscles itsthews of iron and roared out upon the open track filling the air withthe rasp of its tempestbreath blotting the sunshine with the belchof its hot thick smoke
Already it was lessening in the distance whenDelaney Christian and the sheriff of Visalia dashed up to the station
The posse had seen everything
Curse the luck vociferated the cowPuncher
But the sheriff was already out of the saddle and into the telegraphoffice
Theres derailing switch between here and Pixley isnt there hecried
YesWire ahead to open it
Well derail him there
Come on he turned toDelaney and the others
They sprang into the cab of the locomotive thatwas attached to the freight train
Name of the State of California shouted the sheriff to the bewilderedengineer
Cut off from your trainThe sheriff was man to be obeyed without hesitating
Time was notallowed the crew of the freight train for debating as to the right orthe wrong of requisitioning the engine and before anyone thought of thesafety or danger of the affair the freight engine was already flyingout upon the down line hot in pursuit of Dyke now far ahead upon theup track
remember perfectly well theres derailing switch between here andPixley shouted the sheriff above the roar of the locomotive
They useit in case they have to derail runaway engines
It runs right off intothe country
Well pile him up there
Ready with your guns boysIf we should meet another train coming up on this track protestedthe frightened engineer
Then wed jump or be smashed
There he is As the freightengine rounded curve Dykes engine came into view shooting on somequarter of mile ahead of them wreathed in whirling smoke
The switch aint much further on clamoured the engineer
You can seePixley nowDyke his hand on the grip of the valve that controlled the steam hishead out of the cab window thundered on
He was back in his old placeagain once more he was the engineer once more he felt the enginequiver under him the familiar noises were in his ears the familiarbuffeting of the wind surged roaring at his face the familiar odoursof hot steam and smoke reeked in his nostrils and on either side ofhim parallel panoramas the two halves of the landscape sliced as itwere in two by the clashing wheels of his engine streamed by in greenand brown blurs
He found himself settling to the old position on the cab seat leaningon his elbow from the window one hand on the controller
All at oncethe instinct of the pursuit that of late had become so strong withinhim prompted him to shoot glance behind
He saw the other engine onthe down line plunging after him rocking from side to side with thefury of its gallop
Not yet had he shaken the trackers from his heelsnot yet was he out of the reach of danger
He set his teeth andthrowing open the firedoor stoked vigorously for few moments
Theindicator of the steam gauge rose his speed increased glance atthe telegraph poles told him he was doing his fifty miles an hour
Thefreight engine behind him was never built for that pace
Barring theterrible risk of accident his chances were good
But suddenlythe engineer dominating the highwaymanhe shut off hissteam and threw back his brake to the extreme notch
Directly aheadof him rose semaphore placed at point where evidently derailingswitch branched from the line
The semaphores arm was dropped over thetrack setting the danger signal that showed the switch was open
In an instant Dyke saw the trick
They had meant to smash him herehad been clever enough quickwitted enough to open the switch but hadforgotten the automatic semaphore that worked simultaneously with themovement of the rails
To go forward was certain destruction
There was nothing for it but to go back
With wrench and aspasm of all its metal fibres the great compound braced itself slidingwith rigid wheels along the rails
Then as Dyke applied the reverseit drew back from the greater danger returning towards the less
Inevitably now the two engines one on the up the other on the downline must meet and pass each other
Dyke released the levers reaching for his revolver
The engineer oncemore became the highwayman in peril of his life
Now beyond all doubtthe time for fighting was at hand
The party in the heavy freight engine that lumbered after in pursuittheir eyes fixed on the smudge of smoke on ahead that marked the path ofthe fugitive suddenly raised shout
Hes stopped
Hes broke down
Watch now and see if he jumps offBroke NOTHING
HES COMING BACK
Ready now hes got to pass usThe engineer applied the brakes but the heavy freight locomotive farless mobile than Dykes flyer was slow to obey
The smudge on the railsahead grew swiftly larger
Hes coming
Hes cominglook out theres shot
Hes shootingalreadyA bright white sliver of wood leaped into the air from the sooty windowsill of the cab
Fire on him
Fire on himWhile the engines were yet two hundred yards apart the duel began shotanswering shot the sharp staccato reports punctuating the thunder ofwheels and the clamour of steam
Then the ground trembled and rocked roar as of heavy ordnancedeveloped with the abruptness of an explosion
The two engines passedeach other the men firing the while emptying their revolversshattering wood shivering glass the bullets clanging against the metalwork as they struck and struck and struck
The men leaned from thecabs towards each other frantic with excitement shouting curses theengines rocking the steam roaring confusion whirling in the scenelike the whirl of witchs dance the white clouds of steam the blackeddies from the smokestack the blue wreaths from the hot mouths ofrevolvers swirling together in blinding maze of vapour spinningaround them dazing them dizzying them while the head rang withhideous clamour and the body twitched and trembled with the leap and jarof the tumult of machinery
Roaring clamouring reeking with the smell of powder and hot oilspitting death resistless huge furious an abrupt vision of chaosfaces ragedistorted peering through smoke hands gripping outwardfrom sudden darkness prehensile malevolent terrible as thunder swiftas lightning the two engines met and passed
Hes hit cried Delaney
know hit him
He cant go far now
Afterhim again
He wont dare go through BonnevilleIt was true
Dyke had stood between cab and tender throughout all theduel exposed reckless thinking only of attack and not of defence anda bullet from one of the pistols had grazed his hip
How serious was thewound he did not know but he had no thought of giving up
He tore backthrough the depot at Guadalajara in storm of bullets and clinging tothe broken window ledge of his cab was carried towards Bonneville onover the Long Trestle and Broderson Creek and through the open countrybetween the two ranches of Los Muertos and Quien Sabe
But to go on to Bonneville meant certain death
Before as well asbehind him the roads were now blocked
Once more he thought of themountains
He resolved to abandon the engine and make another finalattempt to get into the shelter of the hills in the northernmost cornerof Quien Sabe
He set his teeth
He would not give in
There was onemore fight left in him yet
Now to try the final hope
He slowed the engine down and reloading his revolver jumped from theplatform to the road
He looked about him listening
All around himwidened an ocean of wheat
There was no one in sight
The released engine alone unattended drew slowly away from himjolting ponderously over the rail joints
As he watched it go certainindefinite sense of abandonment even in that moment came over Dyke
His last friend that also had been his first was leaving him
Heremembered that day long ago when he had opened the throttle of hisfirst machine
Today it was leaving him alone his last friend turningagainst him
Slowly it was going back towards Bonneville to the shopsof the Railroad the camp of the enemy that enemy that had ruinedhim and wrecked him
For the last time in his life he had been theengineer
Now once more he became the highwayman the outlaw againstwhom all hands were raised the fugitive skulking in the mountainslistening for the cry of dogs
But he would not give in
They had not broken him yet
Never while hecould fight would he allow Behrman the triumph of his capture
He found his wound was not bad
He plunged into the wheat on Quien Sabemaking northward for division house that rose with its surroundingtrees out of the wheat like an island
He reached it the bloodsquelching in his shoes
But the sight of two men Portuguesefarmhands staring at him from an angle of the barn abruptly rousedhim to action
He sprang forward with peremptory commands demanding ahorse
At Guadalajara Delaney and the sheriff descended from the freightengine
Horses now declared the sheriff
He wont go into Bonneville thatscertain
Hell leave the engine between here and there and strike offinto the country
Well follow after him now in the saddle
Soon as heleaves his engine HES on foot
Weve as good as got him nowTheir horses including even the buckskin mare that Dyke had riddenwere still at the station
The party swung themselves up Delaneyexclaiming Heres MY mount as he bestrode the buckskin
At Guadalajara the two bloodhounds were picked up again
Urging thejaded horses to gallop the party set off along the Upper Roadkeeping sharp lookout to right and left for traces of Dykesabandonment of the engine
Three miles beyond the Long Trestle they found Behrman holding hissaddle horse by the bridle and looking attentively at trail that hadbeen broken through the standing wheat on Quien Sabe
The party drewrein
The engine passed me on the tracks further up and empty said SBehrman
Boys think he left her hereBut before anyone could answer the bloodhounds gave tongue again asthey picked up the scent
Thats him cried Behrman
Get on boysThey dashed forward following the hounds
Behrman laboriouslyclimbed to his saddle panting perspiring mopping the roll of fat overhis coat collar and turned in after them trotting along far in therear his great stomach and tremulous jowl shaking with the horsesgait
What day he murmured
What dayDykes trail was fresh and was followed as easily as if made onnewfallen snow
In short time the posse swept into the openspace around the division house
The two Portuguese were still therewideeyed terribly excited
Yes yes Dyke had been there not half an hour since had held them uptaken horse and galloped to the northeast towards the foothills atthe headwaters of Broderson Creek
On again at full gallop through the young wheat trampling it underthe flying hoofs the hounds hot on the scent baying continually themen on fresh mounts secured at the division house bending forward intheir saddles spurring relentlessly
Behrman jolted along far in therear
And even then harried through an open country where there was no placeto hide it was matter of amazement how long chase the highwaymanled them
Fences were passed fences whose barbed wire had been slashedapart by the fugitives knife
The ground rose under foot the hillswere at hand still the pursuit held on
The sun long past themeridian began to turn earthward
Would night come on before they wereup with him
There he is
Quick there he goesHigh on the bare slope of the nearest hill all the posse looking inthe direction of Delaneys gesture saw the figure of horseman emergefrom an arroyo filled with chaparral and struggle at labouringgallop straight up the slope
Suddenly every member of the partyshouted aloud
The horse had fallen pitching the rider from the saddle
The man rose to his feet caught at the bridle missed it and the horsedashed on alone
The man pausing for second looked around saw thechase drawing nearer then turning back disappeared in the chaparral
Delaney raised great whoop
Weve got you now Into the slopes and valleys of the hills dashedthe band of horsemen the trail now so fresh that it could be easilydiscerned by all
On and on it led them furious wild scramblestraight up the slopes
The minutes went by
The dry bed of rivuletwas passed then another fence then tangle of manzanita meadow ofwild oats full of agitated cattle then an arroyo thick with chaparraland scrub oaks and then without warning the pistol shots ripped outand ran from rider to rider with the rapidity of gatling dischargeand one of the deputies bent forward in the saddle both hands to hisface the blood jetting from between his fingers
Dyke was there at bay at last his back against bank of rock theroots of fallen tree serving him as rampart his revolver smoking inhis hand
Youre under arrest Dyke cried the sheriff
Its not the least useto fight
The whole country is upDyke fired again the shot splintering the foreleg of the horse thesheriff rode
The posse four men all toldthe wounded deputy having crawled outof the fight after Dykes first shotfell back after the preliminaryfusillade dismounted and took shelter behind rocks and trees
On thatrugged ground fighting from the saddle was impracticable
Dyke in themeanwhile held his fire for he knew that once his pistol was emptyhe would never be allowed time to reload
Dyke called the sheriff again for the last time summon you tosurrenderDyke did not reply
The sheriff Delaney and the man named Christianconferred together in low voice
Then Delaney and Christian leftthe others making wide detour up the sides of the arroyo to gain aposition to the left and somewhat to the rear of Dyke
But it was at this moment that Behrman arrived
It could not be saidwhether it was courage or carelessness that brought the Railroads agentwithin reach of Dykes revolver
Possibly he was really brave manpossibly occupied with keeping an uncertain seat upon the back of hislabouring scrambling horse he had not noticed that he was so closeupon that scene of battle
He certainly did not observe the posse lyingupon the ground behind sheltering rocks and trees and before anyonecould call warning he had ridden out into the open within thirtypaces of Dykes intrenchment
Dyke saw
There was the archenemy the man of all men whom he mosthated the man who had ruined him who had exasperated him and drivenhim to crime and who had instigated tireless pursuit through all thosepast terrible weeks
Suddenly inviting death he leaped up and forwardhe had forgotten all else all other considerations at the sight ofthis man
He would die gladly so only that Behrman died before him
Ive got YOU anyway he shouted as he ran forward
The muzzle of the weapon was not ten feet from Behrmans huge stomachas Dyke drew the trigger
Had the cartridge exploded death certain andswift would have followed but at this of all moments the revolvermissed fire
Behrman with an unexpected agility leaped from the saddle andkeeping his horse between him and Dyke ran dodging and ducking fromtree to tree
His first shot failure Dyke fired again and again athis enemy emptying his revolver reckless of consequences
His everyshot went wild and before he could draw his knife the whole posse wasupon him
Without concerted plans obeying no signal but the promptings of theimpulse that snatched unerring at opportunitythe men Delaney andChristian from one side the sheriff and the deputy from the otherrushed in
They did not fire
It was Dyke alive they wanted
One of themhad riata snatched from saddlepommel and with this they tried tobind him
The fight was four to onefour men with law on their side to onewounded freebooter halfstarved exhausted by days and nights ofpursuit worn down with loss of sleep thirst privation and thegrinding nerveracking consciousness of an everpresent peril
They swarmed upon him from all sides gripping at his legs at hisarms his throat his head striking clutching kicking falling tothe ground rolling over and over now under now above now staggeringforward now toppling back
Still Dyke fought
Through that scramblingstruggling group through that maze of twisting bodies twining armsstraining legs Behrman saw him from moment to moment his faceflaming his eyes bloodshot his hair matted with sweat
Now he wasdown pinned under two men across his legs and now halfway up againstruggling to one knee
Then upright again with half his enemieshanging on his back
His colossal strength seemed doubled when hisarms were held he fought bulllike with his head
score of times itseemed as if they were about to secure him finally and irrevocably andthen he would free an arm leg shoulder and the group that forthe fraction of an instant had settled locked and rigid on its preywould break up again as he flung man from him reeling and bloody andhe himself twisting squirming dodging his great fists working likepistons backed away dragging and carrying the others with him
More than once he loosened almost every grip and for an instant stoodnearly free panting rolling his eyes his clothes torn from his bodybleeding dripping with sweat terrible figure nearly free
Thesheriff under his breath uttered an exclamationBy God hell get away yetS Behrman watched the fight complacently
That all may show obstinacy he commented but it dont show commonsenseYet however Dyke might throw off the clutches and fettering embracesthat encircled him however he might disintegrate and scatter the bandof foes that heaped themselves upon him however he might gain oneinstant of comparative liberty some one of his assailants always hungdoggedly blindly to an arm leg or foot and the others drawing aseconds breath closed in again implacable unconquerable ferociouslike hounds upon wolf
At length two of the men managed to bring Dykes wrists close enoughtogether to allow the sheriff to snap the handcuffs on
Even then Dykeclasping his hands and using the handcuffs themselves as weaponknocked down Delaney by the crushing impact of the steel bracelets uponthe cowpunchers forehead
But he could no longer protect himself fromattacks from behind and the riata was finally passed around his bodypinioning his arms to his sides
After this it was useless to resist
The wounded deputy sat with his back to rock holding his broken jawin both hands
The sheriffs horse with its splintered foreleg wouldhave to be shot
Delaneys head was cut from temple to cheekbone
Theright wrist of the sheriff was all but dislocated
The other deputy wasso exhausted he had to be helped to his horse
But Dyke was taken
He himself had suddenly lapsed into semiunconsciousness unable towalk
They sat him on the buckskin Behrman supporting him thesheriff on foot leading the horse by the bridle
The little processionformed and descended from the hills turning in the direction ofBonneville
special train one car and an engine would be made upthere and the highwayman would sleep in the Visalia jail that night
Delaney and Behrman found themselves in the rear of the cavalcade asit moved off
The cowpuncher turned to his chiefWell captain he said still panting as he bound up his foreheadwellwe GOT himCHAPTER VIOsterman cut his wheat that summer before any of the other ranchersand as soon as his harvest was over organized jackrabbit drive
Like Annixters barndance it was to be an event in which all thecountryside should take part
The drive was to begin on the mostwestern division of the Osterman ranch whence it would proceed towardsthe southeast crossing into the northern part of Quien Sabeon whichAnnixter had sown no wheatand ending in the hills at the headwaters ofBroderson Creek where barbecue was to be held
Early on the morning of the day of the drive as Harran and Presley weresaddling their horses before the stables on Los Muertos the foremanPhelps remarkedI was into town last night and hear that Christian has been afterRuggles early and late to have him put him in possession here on LosMuertos and Delaney is doing the same for Quien SabeIt was this man Christian the real estate broker and cousin of SBehrman one of the main actors in the drama of Dykes capture whohad come forward as purchaser of Los Muertos when the Railroad hadregraded its holdings on the ranches around Bonneville
He claims of course Phelps went on that when he bought Los Muertosof the Railroad he was guaranteed possession and he wants the place intime for the harvestThats almost as thin muttered Harran as he thrust the bit into hishorses mouth as Delaney buying Annixters Home ranch
That sliceof Quien Sabe according to the Railroads grading is worth about tenthousand dollars yes even fifteen and dont believe Delaney isworth the price of good horse
Why those people dont even try topreserve appearances
Where would Christian find the money to buy LosMuertos
Theres no one man in all Bonneville rich enough to do it
Damned rascals
as if we didnt see that Christian and Delaney areS Behrmans right and left hands
Well hell get em cut off hecried with sudden fierceness if he comes too near the machineHow is it Harran asked Presley as the two young men rode out of thestable yard how is it the Railroad gang can do anything before theSupreme Court hands down decisionWell you know how they talk growled Harran
They have claimed thatthe cases taken up to the Supreme Court were not test cases as WE claimthey ARE and that because neither Annixter nor the Governor appealedtheyve lost their cases by default
Its the rottenest kind of sharppractice but it wont do any good
The League is too strong
They wontdare move on us yet awhile
Why Pres the moment theyd try to jumpany of these ranches around here they would have six hundred riflescracking at them as quick as howdoyoudo
Why it would take aregiment of soldiers to put any one of us off our land
No sirthey know the League means business this timeAs Presley and Harran trotted on along the county road they continuallypassed or overtook other horsemen or buggies carryalls buckboardsor even farm wagons going in the same direction
These were full of thefarming people from all the country round about Bonneville on their wayto the rabbit drivethe same people seen at the barndancein theirSunday finest the girls in muslin frocks and garden hats the men withlinen dusters over their black clothes the older women in printsand dotted calicoes
Many of these latter had already taken off theirbonnetsthe day was very hotand pinning them in newspapers stowedthem under the seats
They tucked their handkerchiefs into the collarsof their dresses or knotted them about their fat necks to keep outthe dust
From the axle trees of the vehicles swung carefully coveredbuckets of galvanised iron in which the lunch was packed
Theyounger children the boys with great frilled collars the girls withillfitting shoes cramping their feet leaned from the sides of buggyand carryall eating bananas and macaroons staring about withoxlike stolidity
Tied to the axles the dogs followed the horseshoofs with lolling tongues coated with dust
The California summer lay blanketwise and smothering over all theland
The hills bonedry were browned and parched
The grasses andwildoats sear and yellow snapped like glass filaments under foot
Theroads the bordering fences even the lower leaves and branches of thetrees were thick and grey with dust
All colour had been burned fromthe landscape except in the irrigated patches that in the waste ofbrown and dull yellow glowed like oases
The wheat now close to its maturity had turned from pale yellow togolden yellow and from that to brown
Like gigantic carpet it spreaditself over all the land
There was nothing else to be seen but thelimitless sea of wheat as far as the eye could reach dry rustlingcrisp and harsh in the rare breaths of hot wind out of the southeast
As Harran and Presley went along the county road the number of vehiclesand riders increased
They overtook and passed Hooven and his familyin the formers farm wagon saddled horse tied to the back board
Thelittle Dutchman wearing the old frock coat of Magnus Derrick and anew broadbrimmed straw hat sat on the front seat with Mrs Hooven
Thelittle girl Hilda and the older daughter Minna were behind them on aboard laid across the sides of the wagon
Presley and Harran stopped toshake hands
Say cried Hooven exhibiting an old but extremely wellkept rifle say bei Gott me tek some schatz at dose rebbit youbedt
Ven he hef shtop to run und sit oop soh bei der hind laigs on Ioop mit der guhn undbing
cetch umThe marshals wont allow you to shoot Bismarck observed Presleylooking at Minna
Hooven doubled up with merriment
dots hell of some fine joak
Me IM ONE OAF DOSE MAIRSCHELLMINESELLUF he roared with delight beating his knee
To his notionthe joke was irresistible
All day long he could be heard repeating it
Und Mistr Praicelie he say Dose mairschell woand led you schootBismarck und ME ach Gott ME aindt mineselluf one oaf dosemairschellAs the two friends rode on Presley had in his mind the image of MinnaHooven very pretty in clean gown of pink gingham cheap strawsailor hat from Bonneville store on her blue black hair
He rememberedher very pale face very red lips and eyes of greenish bluea prettygirl certainly always trailing group of men behind her
Her loveaffairs were the talk of all Los Muertos
hope that Hooven girl wont go to the bad Presley said to Harran
Oh shes all right the other answered
Theres nothing viciousabout Minna and guess shell marry that foreman on the ditch gangright enoughWell as matter of course shes good girl Presley hastenedto reply only shes too pretty for poor girl and too sure of herprettiness besides
Thats the kind he continued who would find itpretty easy to go wrong if they lived in cityAround Carahers was veritable throng
Saddle horses and buggies bythe score were clustered underneath the shed or hitched to the railingsin front of the watering trough
Three of Brodersons Portuguese tenantsand couple of workmen from the railroad shops in Bonneville were onthe porch already very drunk
Continually young men singly or in groups came from the doorwaywiping their lips with sidelong gestures of the hand
The whole placeexhaled the febrile bustle of the saloon on holiday morning
The procession of teams streamed on through Bonneville reenforcedat every street corner
Along the Upper Road from Quien Sabe andGuadalajara came fresh auxiliaries SpanishMexicans from the townitselfswarthy young men on capering horses darkeyed girls andmatrons in red and black and yellow more Portuguese in brandnewoveralls smoking long thin cigars
Even Father Sarria appeared
Look said Presley there goes Annixter and Hilma
Hes got hisbuckskin back The master of Quien Sabe in top laced boots andcampaign hat cigar in his teeth followed along beside the carryall
Hilma and Mrs Derrick were on the back seat young Vacca driving
Harran and Presley bowed taking off their hats
Hello hello Pres cried Annixter over the heads of the interveningcrowd standing up in his stirrups and waving hand Great day
What amob hey
Say when this thing is over and everybody starts to walk intothe barbecue come and have lunch with us
Ill look for you you andHarran
Hello Harran wheres the GovernorHe didnt come today Harran shouted back as the crowd carried himfurther away from Annixter
Left him and old Broderson at Los MuertosThe throng emerged into the open country again spreading out upon theOsterman ranch
From all directions could be seen horses and buggiesdriving across the stubble converging upon the rendezvous
OstermansRanch house was left to the eastward the army of the guests hurryingforwardfor it began to be lateto where around flag pole flyinga red flag vast crowd of buggies and horses was already forming
Themarshals began to appear
Hooven descending from the farm wagon pinnedhis white badge to his hat brim and mounted his horse
Osterman inmarvellous riding clothes of English pattern galloped up and down uponhis best thoroughbred cracking jokes with everybody chaffing joshinghis great mouth distended in perpetual grin of amiability
Stop here stop here he vociferated dashing along in front ofPresley and Harran waving his crop
The procession came to haltthe horses heads pointing eastward
The line began to be formed
Themarshals perspiring shouting fretting galloping about urging thisone forward ordering this one back ranged the thousands of conveyancesand cavaliers in long line shaped like wide open crescent
Itswings under the command of lieutenants were slightly advanced
Far outbefore its centre Osterman took his place delighted beyond expressionat his conspicuousness posing for the gallery making his horse dance
Wail aindt dey gowun to gommence den bretty soohn exclaimed MrsHooven who had taken her husbands place on the forward seat of thewagon
never was so warm murmured Minna fanning herself with her hat
Allseemed in readiness
For miles over the flat expanse of stubble curvedthe interminable lines of horses and vehicles
At guess nearly fivethousand people were present
The drive was one of the largest everheld
But no start was made immobilized the vast crescent stuckmotionless under the blazing sun
Here and there could be heard voicesuplifted in jocular remonstrance
Oh say get move on somebodyALL aboardSay Ill take root here pretty soonSome took malicious pleasure in starting false alarms
Ah HERE we goOff at lastWere offInvariably these jokes fooled some one in the line
An old man or someold woman nervous hard of hearing always gathered up the reins andstarted off only to be hustled and ordered back into the line by thenearest marshal
This manoeuvre never failed to produce its effect ofhilarity upon those near at hand
Everybody laughed at the blundererthe joker jeering audibly
Hey come back hereOh hes easyDont be in hurry GrandpaSay you want to drive all the rabbits yourselfLater on certain group of these fellows started huge joshSay thats what were waiting for the dofunny
The dofunnySure you cant drive rabbits without the dofunny
Whats the dofunnyOh say she dont know what the dofunny is
We cant start withoutit sure
Pete went back to get itOh youre joking me theres no such thingWell arent we WAITING for itOh look look cried some women in covered rig
See they arestarting already way over thereIn fact it did appear as if the far extremity of the line was inmotion
Dust rose in the air above it
They ARE starting
Why dont we startNo theyve stopped
False alarmTheyve not either
Why dont we moveBut as one or two began to move off the nearest marshal shoutedwrathfullyGet back there get back thereWell theyve started over thereGet back tell youWheres the dofunny
Say were going to miss it all
Theyve all started over thereA lieutenant came galloping along in front of the line shoutingHere whats the matter here
Why dont you startThere was great shout
Everybody simultaneously uttered prolongedOhhWere offHere we go for sure this timeRemember to keep the alignment roared the lieutenant
Dont go toofastAnd the marshals rushing here and there on their sweating horses topoints where the line bulged forward shouted waving their arms Nottoo fast not too fastKeep back hereHere keep closer togetherhere
Do you want to let all the rabbits run back between youA great confused sound rose into the airthe creaking of axles thejolt of iron tires over the dry clods the click of brittle stubbleunder the horses hoofs the barking of dogs the shouts of conversationand laughter
The entire line horses buggies wagons gigs dogs men and boys onfoot and armed with clubs moved slowly across the fields sending upa cloud of white dust that hung above the scene like smoke
briskgaiety was in the air
Everyone was in the best of humor callingfrom team to team laughing skylarking joshing
Garnett of theRuby Rancho and Gethings of the San Pablo both on horseback foundthemselves side by side
Ignoring the drive and the spirit of theoccasion they kept up prolonged and serious conversation on anexpected rise in the price of wheat
Dabney also on horseback followedthem listening attentively to every word but hazarding no remark
Mrs Derrick and Hilma sat in the back seat of the carryall behindyoung Vacca
Mrs Derrick little disturbed by such great concourseof people frightened at the idea of the killing of so many rabbitsdrew back in her place her younggirl eyes troubled and filled witha vague distress
Hilma very much excited leaned from the carryallanxious to see everything watching for rabbits asking innumerablequestions of Annixter who rode at her side
The change that had been progressing in Hilma ever since the night ofthe famous barndance now seemed to be approaching its climax firstthe girl then the woman last of all the Mother
Conscious dignity anew element in her character developed
The shrinking the timidity ofthe girl just awakening to the consciousness of sex passed away fromher
The confusion the troublous complexity of the woman mysteryeven to herself disappeared
Motherhood dawned the old simplicityof her maiden days came back to her
It was no longer simplicity ofignorance but of supreme knowledge the simplicity of the perfect thesimplicity of greatness
She looked the world fearlessly in the eyes
At last the confusion of her ideas like frightened birds resettlingadjusted itself and she emerged from the trouble calm sereneentering into her divine right like queen into the rule of realm ofperpetual peace
And with this with the knowledge that the crown hung poised aboveher head there came upon Hilma gentleness infinitely beautifulinfinitely pathetic sweetness that touched all who came near herwith the softness of caress
She moved surrounded by an invisibleatmosphere of Love
Love was in her wideopened brown eyes Lovethedim reflection of that descending crown poised over her headradiatedin faint lustre from her dark thick hair
Around her beautiful necksloping to her shoulders with full graceful curves Love lay encircledlike necklaceLove that was beyond words sweet breathed fromher parted lips
From her white large arms downward to her pinkfingertipsLove an invisible electric fluid disengaged itselfsubtle alluring
In the velvety huskiness of her voice Love vibratedlike note of unknown music
Annixter her uncouth rugged husband living in this influence of awife who was also mother at all hours touched to the quick by thissense of nobility of gentleness and of love the instincts of fatheralready clutching and tugging at his heart was trembling on the vergeof mighty transformation
The hardness and inhumanity of the man wasfast breaking up
One night returning late to the Ranch house aftera compulsory visit to the city he had come upon Hilma asleep
He hadnever forgotten that night
realization of his boundless happiness inthis love he gave and received the thought that Hilma TRUSTED him aknowledge of his own unworthiness vast and humble thankfulness thathis God had chosen him of all men for this great joy had brought himto his knees for the first time in all his troubled restless lifeof combat and aggression
He prayed he knew not whatvague wordswordless thoughts resolving fiercely to do right to make some returnfor Gods gift thus placed within his hands
Where once Annixter had thought only of himself he now thought only ofHilma
The time when this thought of another should broaden and wideninto thought of OTHERS was yet to come but already it had expanded toinclude the unborn childalready as in the case of Mrs Dyke it hadbroadened to enfold another child and another mother bound to him by noties other than those of humanity and pity
In time starting from thispoint it would reach out more and more till it should take in all menand all women and the intolerant selfish man while retaining allof his native strength should become tolerant and generous kind andforgiving
For the moment however the two natures struggled within him
fightwas to be fought one more the last the fiercest the attack of theenemy who menaced his very home and hearth was to be resisted
Thenpeace attained arrested development would once more proceed
Hilma looked from the carryall scanning the open plain in front of theadvancing line of the drive
Where are the rabbits she asked of Annixter
dont see any atallThey are way ahead of us yet he said
Here take the glassesHe passed her his field glasses and she adjusted them
Oh yes she cried see
can see five or six but oh so faroffThe beggars run way ahead at firstI should say so
See them runlittle specks
Every now and then theysit up their ears straight up in the airHere look Hilma there goes one close byFrom out of the ground apparently some twenty yards distant agreat jack sprang into view bounding away with tremendous leaps hisblacktipped ears erect
He disappeared his grey body losing itselfagainst the grey of the ground
Oh big fellowHi yonders anotherYes yes oh look at him run From off the surface of the groundat first apparently empty of all life and seemingly unable to affordhiding place for so much as fieldmouse jackrabbits started up atevery moment as the line went forward
At first they appeared singlyand at long intervals then in twos and threes as the drive continuedto advance
They leaped across the plain and stopped in the distancesitting up with straight ears then ran on again were joined by otherssank down flush to the soiltheir ears flattened started up againran to the side turned back once more darted away with incredibleswiftness and were lost to view only to be replaced by score ofothers
Gradually the number of jacks to be seen over the expanse of stubble infront of the line of teams increased
Their antics were infinite
No twoacted precisely alike
Some lay stubbornly close in little depressionbetween two clods till the horses hoofs were all but upon themthen sprang out from their hidingplace at the last second
Others ranforward but few yards at time refusing to take flight scenting agreater danger before them than behind
Still others forced up at thelast moment doubled with lightning alacrity in their tracks turningback to scuttle between the teams taking desperate chances
As often asthis occurred it was the signal for great uproar
Dont let him get through don let him get throughLook out for him there he goesHorns were blown bells rung tin pans clamorously beaten
Either thejack escaped or confused by the noise darted back again fleeingaway as if his life depended on the issue of the instant
Once even abewildered rabbit jumped fair into Mrs Derricks lap as she sat in thecarryall and was out again like flash
Poor frightened thing she exclaimed and for long time afterwardshe retained upon her knees the sensation of the four little pawsquivering with excitement and the feel of the trembling furry bodywith its wildly beating heart pressed against her own
By noon the number of rabbits discernible by Annixters field glasseson ahead was far into the thousands
What seemed to be ground resolveditself when seen through the glasses into maze of small movingbodies leaping ducking doubling running back and fortha wildernessof agitated ears white tails and twinkling legs
The outside wings ofthe curved line of vehicles began to draw in little Ostermans ranchwas left behind the drive continued on over Quien Sabe
As the day advanced the rabbits singularly enough became less wild
When flushed they no longer ran so far nor so fast limping off insteada few feet at time and crouching down their ears close upon theirbacks
Thus it was that by degrees the teams began to close up on themain herd
At every instant the numbers increased
It was no longerthousands it was tens of thousands
The earth was alive with rabbits
Denser and denser grew the throng
In all directions nothing was to beseen but the loose mass of the moving jacks
The horns of the crescentof teams began to contract
Far off the corral came into sight
Thedisintegrated mass of rabbits commenced as it were to solidify tocoagulate
At first each jack was some three feet distant from hisnearest neighbor but this space diminished to two feet then to onethen to but few inches
The rabbits began leaping over one another
Then the strange scene defined itself
It was no longer herd coveringthe earth
It was sea whipped into confusion tossing incessantlyleaping falling agitated by unseen forces
At times the unexpectedtameness of the rabbits all at once vanished
Throughout certainportions of the herd eddies of terror abruptly burst forth
panicspread then there would ensue blind wild rushing together ofthousands of crowded bodies and furious scrambling over backstill the scuffing thud of innumerable feet over the earth rose to areverberating murmur as of distant thunder here and there pierced bythe strange wild cry of the rabbit in distress
The line of vehicles was halted
To go forward now meant to tramplethe rabbits under foot
The drive came to standstill while the herdentered the corral
This took time for the rabbits were by now toocrowded to run
However like an opened sluicegate the extendingflanks of the entrance of the corral slowly engulfed the herd
The masspacked tight as ever by degrees diminished precisely as pool ofwater when dam is opened
The last stragglers went in with rush andthe gate was dropped
Come just have lock in here called Annixter
Hilma descending from the carryall and joined by Presley and Harranapproached and looked over the high board fence
Oh did you ever see anything like that she exclaimed
The corral really large enclosure had proved all too small forthe number of rabbits collected by the drive
Inside it was livingmoving leaping breathing twisting mass
The rabbits were packed twothree and four feet deep
They were in constant movement those beneathstruggling to the top those on top sinking and disappearing belowtheir fellows
All wildness all fear of man seemed to have entirelydisappeared
Men and boys reaching over the sides of the corral pickedup jack in each hand holding them by the ears while two reportersfrom San Francisco papers took photographs of the scene
The noise madeby the tens of thousands of moving bodies was as the noise of wind in aforest while from the hot and sweating mass there rose strange odorpenetrating ammoniacal savouring of wild life
On signal the killing began
Dogs that had been brought there for thatpurpose when let into the corral refused as had been half expectedto do the work
They snuffed curiously at the pile then backed offdisturbed perplexed
But the men and boysPortuguese for the mostpartwere more eager
Annixter drew Hilma away and indeed most ofthe people set about the barbecue at once
In the corral however the killing went forward
Armed with club ineach hand the young fellows from Guadalajara and Bonneville and thefarm boys from the ranches leaped over the rails of the corral
Theywalked unsteadily upon the myriad of crowding bodies underfoot or asspace was cleared sank almost waist deep into the mass that leaped andsquirmed about them
Blindly furiously they struck and struck
TheAngloSaxon spectators round about drew back in disgust but the hotdegenerated blood of Portuguese Mexican and mixed Spaniard boiled upin excitement at this wholesale slaughter
But only few of the participants of the drive cared to look on
Allthe guests betook themselves some quarter of mile farther on into thehills
The picnic and barbecue were to be held around the spring whereBroderson Creek took its rise
Already two entire beeves were roastingthere teams were hitched saddles removed and men women andchildren great throng spread out under the shade of the live oaks
Avast confused clamour rose in the air babel of talk clatter oftin plates of knives and forks
Bottles were uncorked napkins andoilcloths spread over the ground
The men lit pipes and cigars thewomen seized the occasion to nurse their babies
Osterman ubiquitous as ever resplendent in his boots and Englishriding breeches moved about between the groups keeping up an endlessflow of talk cracking jokes winking nudging gesturing putting histongue in his cheek never at loss for reply playing the goat
That josher Osterman always at his monkeyshines but good fellowfor all that brainy too
Nothing stuck up about him either like MagnusDerrickEverything all right Buck inquired Osterman coming up to whereAnnixter Hilma and Mrs Derrick were sitting down to their lunch
Yes yes everything right
But weve no corkscrewNo screwcorkno scarecrow
Here you are and he drew from hispocket silverplated jackknife with corkscrew attachment
Harranand Presley came up bearing between them great smoking roastedportion of beef just off the fire
Hilma hastened to put forward hugechina platter
Osterman had joke to crack with the two boys joke that was ratherbroad but as he turned about the words almost on his lips his glancefell upon Hilma herself whom he had not seen for more than two months
She had handed Presley the platter and was now sitting with her backagainst the tree between two boles of the roots
The position was alittle elevated and the supporting roots on either side of her werelike the arms of great chaira chair of state
She sat thus as ona throne raised above the rest the radiance of the unseen crown ofmotherhood glowing from her forehead the beauty of the perfect womansurrounding her like glory
And the josh died away on Ostermans lips and unconsciously and swiftlyhe bared his head
Something was passing there in the air about him thathe did not understand something however that imposed reverence andprofound respect
For the first time in his life embarrassment seizedupon him upon this joker this wearer of clothes this teller of funnystories with his large red ears bald head and comic actors face
Hestammered confusedly and took himself away for the moment abstractedserious lost in thought
By now everyone was eating
It was the feeding of the People elementalgross great appeasing of appetite an enormous quenching of thirst
Quarters of beef roasts ribs shoulders haunches were consumedloaves of bread by the thousands disappeared whole barrels of wine wentdown the dry and dusty throats of the multitude
Conversation laggedwhile the People ate while hunger was appeased
Everybody had theirfill
One ate for the sake of eating resolved that there should benothing left considering it matter of pride to exhibit clean plate
After dinner preparations were made for games
On flat plateau at thetop of one of the hills the contestants were to strive
There was to bea footrace of young girls under seventeen fat mens race the youngerfellows were to put the shot to compete in the running broad jump andthe standing high jump in the hop skip and step and in wrestling
Presley was delighted with it all
It was Homeric this feasting thisvast consuming of meat and bread and wine followed now by games ofstrength
An epic simplicity and directness an honest AngloSaxon mirthand innocence commended it
Crude it was coarse it was but notaint of viciousness was here
These people were good people kindlybenignant even always readier to give than to receive always morewilling to help than to be helped
They were good stock
Of such was thebackbone of the nationsturdy Americans everyone of them
Where elsein the world round were such strong honest men such strong beautifulwomen
Annixter Harran and Presley climbed to the level plateau where thegames were to be held to lay out the courses and mark the distances
It was the very place where once Presley had loved to lounge entireafternoons reading his books of poems smoking and dozing
From thishigh point one dominated the entire valley to the south and west
Theview was superb
The three men paused for moment on the crest of thehill to consider it
Young Vacca came running and panting up the hill after them calling forAnnixter
Well well what is itMr
Ostermans looking for you sir you and Mr Harran
Vanameethat cowboy over at Derricks has just come from the Governor with amessage
guess its importantHello whats up now muttered Annixter as they turned back
They found Osterman saddling his horse in furious haste
Nearby him wasVanamee holding by the bridle an animal that was one lather of sweat
few of the picnickers were turning their heads curiously in thatdirection
Evidently something of moment was in the wind
Whats all up demanded Annixter as he and Harran followed byPresley drew near
Theres hell to pay exclaimed Osterman under his breath
Read that
Vanamee just brought itHe handed Annixter sheet of note paper and turned again to thecinching of his saddle
Weve got to be quick he cried
Theyve stolen march on usAnnixter read the note Harran and Presley looking over his shoulder
Ah its them is it exclaimed Annixter
Harran set his teeth
Now for it he exclaimed
Theyve been to yourplace already Mr Annixter said Vanamee
passed by it on my wayup
They have put Delaney in possession and have set all your furnitureout in the roadAnnixter turned about his lips white
Already Presley and Harran hadrun to their horses
Vacca cried Annixter wheres Vacca
Put the saddle on the buckskinQUICK
Osterman get as many of the League as are here together at THISspot understand
Ill be back in minute
must tell Hilma thisHooven ran up as Annixter disappeared
His little eyes were blazing hewas dragging his horse with him
Say dose fellers come hey
Me Im alretty see hev der guhnTheyve jumped the ranch little girl said Annixter putting one armaround Hilma
Theyre in our house now
Im off
Go to Derricks andwait for me thereShe put her arms around his neck
Youre going she demanded
Dont be frightened
It will be all right
Go to DerricksandgoodbyeShe said never word
She looked once long into his eyes then kissedhim on the mouth
Meanwhile the news had spread
The multitude rose to its feet
Womenand men with pale faces looked at each other speechless or brokeforth into inarticulate exclamations
strange unfamiliar murmur tookthe place of the tumultuous gaiety of the previous moments
sense ofdread of confusion of impending terror weighed heavily in the air
What was now to happen
When Annixter got back to Osterman he found number of the Leaguersalready assembled
They were all mounted
Hooven was there and Harranand besides these Garnett of the Ruby ranch and Gethings of the SanPablo Phelps the foreman of Los Muertos and last of all Dabneysilent as ever speaking to no one
Presley came riding up
Best keep out of this Pres cried Annixter
Are we ready exclaimed Gethings
Ready ready were all hereALL
Is this all of us cried Annixter
Where are the six hundred menwho were going to rise when this happenedThey had wavered these other Leaguers
Now when the actual crisisimpended they were smitten with confusion
Ah no they were not goingto stand up and be shot at just to save Derricks land
They werenot armed
What did Annixter and Osterman take them for
No sir theRailroad had stolen march on them
After all his big talk Derrick hadallowed them to be taken by surprise
The only thing to do was to calla meeting of the Executive Committee
That was the only thing
As forgoing down there with no weapons in their hands NO sir
That wasasking little TOO much
Come on then boys shouted Ostermanturning his back on the others
The Governor says to meet him atHoovens
Well make for the Long Trestle and strike the trail toHoovens thereThey set off
It was terrible ride
Twice during the scramblingdescent from the hills Presleys pony fell beneath him
Annixter onhis buckskin and Osterman on his thoroughbred good horsemen bothled the others setting terrific pace
The hills were left behind
Broderson Creek was crossed and on the levels of Quien Sabe straightthrough the standing wheat the nine horses flogged and spurredstretched out to their utmost
Their passage through the wheat soundedlike the rip and tear of gigantic web of cloth
The landscape oneither hand resolved itself into long blur
Tears came to the eyesflying pebbles clods of earth grains of wheat flung up in the flightstung the face like shot
Ostermans thoroughbred took the secondcrossing of Brodersons Creek in single leap
Down under the LongTrestle tore the cavalcade in shower of mud and gravel up again onthe further bank the horses blowing like steam engines on into thetrail to Hoovens single file now Presleys pony lagging Hoovenshorse bleeding at the eyes the buckskin game as fighting cockcatching her second wind far in the lead now distancing even theEnglish thoroughbred that Osterman rode
At last Hoovens unpainted house beneath the enormous live oak treecame in sight
Across the Lower Road breaking through fences and intothe yard around the house thundered the Leaguers
Magnus was waitingfor them
The riders dismounted hardly less exhausted than their horses
Why wheres all the men Annixter demanded of Magnus
Broderson is here and Cutter replied the Governor no one else
Ithought YOU would bring more men with youThere are only nine of usAnd the six hundred Leaguers who were going to rise when thishappened exclaimed Garnett bitterly
Rot the League cried Annixter
Its gone to potwent to pieces atthe first touchWe have been taken by surprise gentlemen after all said Magnus
Totally off our guard
But there are eleven of us
It is enoughWell whats the game
Has the marshal come
How many men are withhimThe United States marshal from San Francisco explained Magnus camedown early this morning and stopped at Guadalajara
We learned it allthrough our friends in Bonneville about an hour ago
They telephonedme and Mr Broderson
Behrman met him and provided about dozendeputies
Delaney Ruggles and Christian joined them at Guadalajara
They left Guadalajara going towards Mr Annixters ranch house on QuienSabe
They are serving the writs in ejectment and putting the dummybuyers in possession
They are armed
Behrman is with themWhere are they nowCutter is watching them from the Long Trestle
They returned toGuadalajara
They are there nowWell observed Gethings From Guadalajara they can only go to twoplaces
Either they will take the Upper Road and go on to Ostermansnext or they will take the Lower Road to Mr DerricksThat is as supposed said Magnus
That is why wanted you to comehere
From Hoovens here we can watch both roads simultaneouslyIs anybody on the lookout on the Upper RoadCutter
He is on the Long TrestleSay observed Hooven the instincts of the oldtime soldier stirringhim say dose feller pretty demn schmart tink
We got to put somepicket way oudt bei der Lower Roadt alzoh und he tek dose glassusMistr Ennixtr got bei um
Say look at dose irregation ditsch
Dot ditsch he run righd across BOTH dose road hey
Dats some fineentrenchment you bedt
We fighd um from dose ditschIn fact the dry irrigating ditch was natural trench admirably suitedto the purpose crossing both roads as Hooven pointed out and barringapproach from Guadalajara to all the ranches save Annixterswhich hadalready been seized
Gethings departed to join Cutter on the Long Trestle while Phelps andHarran taking Annixters field glasses with them and mounting theirhorses went out towards Guadalajara on the Lower Road to watch for themarshals approach from that direction
After the outposts had left them the party in Hoovens cottage lookedto their weapons
Long since every member of the League had been inthe habit of carrying his revolver with him
They were all armed and inaddition Hooven had his rifle
Presley alone carried no weapon
The main room of Hoovens house in which the Leaguers were nowassembled was barren povertystricken but tolerably clean
An oldclock ticked vociferously on shelf
In one corner was bed with apatched faded quilt
In the centre of the room straddling over thebare floor stood pine table
Around this the men gathered two orthree occupying chairs Annixter sitting sideways on the table the reststanding
believe gentlemen said Magnus that we can go through this daywithout bloodshed
believe not one shot need be fired
The Railroadwill not force the issue will not bring about actual fighting
Whenthe marshal realises that we are thoroughly in earnest thoroughlydetermined am convinced that he will withdrawThere were murmurs of assent
Look here said Annixter if this thing can by any means be settledpeaceably say lets do it so long as we dont give inThe others stared
Was this Annixter who spokethe Hotspur of theLeague the quarrelsome irascible fellow who loved and sought aquarrel
Was it Annixter who now had been the first and only oneof them all to suffer whose ranch had been seized whose householdpossessions had been flung out into the road
When you come right down to it he continued killing man nomatter what hes done to you is serious business
propose we makeone more attempt to stave this thing off
Lets see if we cant get totalk with the marshal himself at any rate warn him of the danger ofgoing any further
Boys lets not fire the first shot
What do yousayThe others agreed unanimously and promptly and old Broderson tugginguneasily at his long beard addedNonono violence no UNNECESSARY violence that is
should hateto have innocent blood on my handsthat is if it IS innocent
dontknow that Behrmanah he is aasurely he had innocent blood onHIS head
That Dyke affair terrible terrible but then Dyke WAS in thewrongdriven to it though the Railroad did drive him to it
want tobe fair and just to everybodyTheres team coming up the road from Los Muertos announced Presleyfrom the door
Fair and just to everybody murmured old Broderson wagging his headfrowning perplexedly
dont want tototo harm anybody unless theyharm meIs the team going towards Guadalajara enquired Garnett getting upand coming to the door
Yes its Portuguese one of the garden truck menWe must turn him back declared Osterman
He cant go through here
We dont want him to take any news on to the marshal and BehrmanIll turn him back said Presley
He rode out towards the market cart and the others watching fromthe road in front of Hoovens saw him halt it
An excited interviewfollowed
They could hear the Portuguese expostulating volubly but inthe end he turned back
Martial law on Los Muertos isnt it observed Osterman
Steady all he exclaimed as he turned about here comes HarranHarran rode up at gallop
The others surrounded him
saw them he cried
They are coming this way
Behrman andRuggles are in twohorse buggy
All the others are on horseback
Thereare eleven of them
Christian and Delaney are with them
Those two haverifles
left Hooven watching themBetter call in Gethings and Cutter right away said Annixter
Wellneed all our menIll call them in Presley volunteered at once
Can have thebuckskin
My pony is about done upHe departed at brisk gallop but on the way met Gethings and Cutterreturning
They too from their elevated position had observed themarshals party leaving Guadalajara by the Lower Road
Presley told themof the decision of the Leaguers not to fire until fired upon
All right said Gethings
But if it comes to gunfight that meansits all up with at least one of us
Delaney never misses his manWhen they reached Hoovens again they found that the Leaguers hadalready taken their position in the ditch
The plank bridge across ithad been torn up
Magnus two long revolvers lying on the embankmentin front of him was in the middle Harran at his side
On either sidesome five feet intervening between each man stood the other Leaguerstheir revolvers ready
Dabney the silent old man had taken off hiscoat
Take your places between Mr Osterman and Mr Broderson said Magnusas the three men rode up
Presley he added forbid you to take anypart in this affairYes keep him out of it cried Annixter from his position at theextreme end of the line
Go back to Hoovens house Pres and lookafter the horses he added
This is no business of yours
And keepthe road behind us clear
Dont let ANY ONE come near not ANY ONEunderstandPresley withdrew leading the buckskin and the horses that Gethings andCutter had ridden
He fastened them under the great live oak and thencame out and stood in the road in front of the house to watch what wasgoing on
In the ditch shoulder deep the Leaguers ready watchful waited insilence their eyes fixed on the white shimmer of the road leading toGuadalajara
Wheres Hooven enquired Cutter
dont know Osterman replied
He was out watching the Lower Roadwith Harran Derrick
Oh Harran he called isnt Hooven coming inI dont know what he is waiting for answered Harran
He was to havecome in just after me
He thought maybe the marshals party might make afeint in this direction then go around by the Upper Road after all
Hewanted to watch them little longer
But he ought to be here nowThink hell take shot at them on his own accountOh no he wouldnt do thatMaybe they took him prisonerWell thats to be thought of tooSuddenly there was cry
Around the bend of the road in front of themcame cloud of dust
From it emerged horses head
Hello hello theres somethingRemember we are not to fire firstPerhaps thats Hooven cant see
Is it
There only seems to be onehorseToo much dust for one horseAnnixter who had taken his field glasses from Harran adjusted them tohis eyes
Thats not them he announced presently nor Hooven either
Thatsa cart Then after another moment he added The butchers cart fromGuadalajaraThe tension was relaxed
The men drew long breaths settling back intheir places
Do we let him go on GovernorThe bridge is down
He cant go by and we must not let him go back
Weshall have to detain him and question him
wonder the marshal let himpassThe cart approached at lively trot
Anybody else in that cart Mr Annixter asked Magnus
It may be ruse
It is strange the marshal should have lethim passThe Leaguers roused themselves again
Osterman laid his hand on hisrevolver
No called Annixter in another instant no theres only one man initThe cart came up and Cutter and Phelps clambering from the ditchstopped it as it arrived in front of the party
Heywhatwhat exclaimed the young butcher pulling up
Is thatbridge brokeBut at the idea of being held the boy protested at top voice badlyfrightened bewildered not knowing what was to happen next
No no got my meat to deliver
Say you let me go
Say aint gotnothing to do with youHe tugged at the reins trying to turn the cart about
Cutter with hisjackknife parted the reins just back of the bit
Youll stay where you are son for while
Were not going to hurtyou
But you are not going back to town till we say so
Did you passanybody on the road out of townIn reply to the Leaguers questions the young butcher at last toldthem he had passed twohorse buggy and lot of men on horseback justbeyond the railroad tracks
They were headed for Los Muertos
Thats them all right muttered Annixter
Theyre coming by thisroad sureThe butchers horse and cart were led to one side of the road and thehorse tied to the fence with one of the severed lines
The butcherhimself was passed over to Presley who locked him in Hoovens barn
Well what the devil demanded Osterman has become of BismarckIn fact the butcher had seen nothing of Hooven
The minutes werepassing and still he failed to appear
Whats he up to anywaysBet you what you like they caught him
Just like that crazy Dutchmanto get excited and go too near
You can always depend on Hooven to losehis headFive minutes passed then ten
The road towards Guadalajara lay emptybaking and white under the sun
Well the marshal and Behrman dont seem to be in any hurryeitherShall go forward and reconnoitre Governor asked Harran
But Dabney who stood next to Annixter touched him on the shoulder andwithout speaking pointed down the road
Annixter looked then suddenlycried outHere comes HoovenThe German galloped into sight around the turn of the road his riflelaid across his saddle
He came on rapidly pulled up and dismounted atthe ditch
Deyre commen he cried trembling with excitement
watch um longdime bei der side oaf der roadt in der busches
Dey shtop bei der gateoder side der relroadt trecks and talk long dime mit one nudder
Dendey gome on
Deyre gowun sure do zum monkeydoodle pizeness
Me seeGritschun put der kertridges in his guhn
tink dey gowun to gome MYblace first
Dey gowun to try put me off tek my home bei GottAll right get down in here and keep quiet Hooven
Dont fireunlessHere they areA halfdozen voices uttered the cry at once
There could be no mistake this time
buggy drawn by two horses cameinto view around the curve of the road
Three riders accompanied itand behind these seen at intervals in cloud of dust weretwothreefivesix others
This then was Behrman with the United States marshal and his posse
The event that had been so long in preparation the event which it hadbeen said would never come to pass the last trial of strength the lastfight between the Trust and the People the direct brutal grapple ofarmed men the law defied the Government ignored behold here it wasclose at hand
Osterman cocked his revolver and in the profound silence that hadfallen upon the scene the click was plainly audible from end to end ofthe line
Remember our agreement gentlemen cried Magnus in warning voice
Osterman must ask you to let down the hammer of your weaponNo one answered
In absolute quiet standing motionless in their placesthe Leaguers watched the approach of the marshal
Five minutes passed
The riders came on steadily
They drew nearer
The grind of the buggy wheels in the grit and dust of the road and theprolonged clatter of the horses feet began to make itself heard
TheLeaguers could distinguish the faces of their enemies
In the buggy were Behrman and Cyrus Ruggles the latter driving
tall man in frock coat and slouched hatthe marshal beyondquestionrode at the left of the buggy Delaney carrying Winchesterat the right
Christian the real estate broker Behrmans cousinalso with rifle could be made out just behind the marshal
Back ofthese riding well up was group of horsemen indistinguishable in thedust raised by the buggys wheels
Steadily the distance between the Leaguers and the posse diminished
Dont let them get too close Governor whispered Harran
When Behrmans buggy was about one hundred yards distant from theirrigating ditch Magnus sprang out upon the road leaving his revolversbehind him
He beckoned Garnett and Gethings to follow and the threeranchers who with the exception of Broderson were the oldest menpresent advanced without arms to meet the marshal
Magnus cried aloudHalt where you areFrom their places in the ditch Annixter Osterman Dabney HarranHooven Broderson Cutter and Phelps their hands laid upon theirrevolvers watched silently alert keen ready for anything
At the Governors words they saw Ruggles pull sharply on the reins
Thebuggy came to standstill the riders doing likewise
Magnus approachedthe marshal still followed by Garnett and Gethings and began to speak
His voice was audible to the men in the ditch but his words could notbe made out
They heard the marshal reply quietly enough and the twoshook hands
Delaney came around from the side of the buggy his horsestanding before the team across the road
He leaned from the saddlelistening to what was being said but made no remark
From time to timeS Behrman and Ruggles from their seats in the buggy interposed asentence or two into the conversation but at first so far as theLeaguers could discern neither Magnus nor the marshal paid them anyattention
They saw however that the latter repeatedly shook his headand once they heard him exclaim in loud voiceI only know my duty Mr DerrickThen Gethings turned about and seeing Delaney close at hand addressedan unheard remark to him
The cowpuncher replied curtly and the wordsseemed to anger Gethings
He made gesture pointing back to theditch showing the intrenched Leaguers to the posse
Delaney appearedto communicate the news that the Leaguers were on hand and prepared toresist to the other members of the party
They all looked toward theditch and plainly saw the ranchers there standing to their arms
But meanwhile Ruggles had addressed himself more directly to Magnus andbetween the two an angry discussion was going forward
Once even Harranheard his father exclaimThe statement is lie and no one knows it better than yourselfHere growled Annixter to Dabney who stood next him in the ditchthose fellows are getting too close
Look at them edging up
DontMagnus see thatThe other members of the marshals force had come forward from theirplaces behind the buggy and were spread out across the road
Some ofthem were gathered about Magnus Garnett and Gethings and some weretalking together looking and pointing towards the ditch
Whether actingupon signal or not the Leaguers in the ditch could not tell but itwas certain that one or two of the posse had moved considerably forward
Besides this Delaney had now placed his horse between Magnus and theditch and two others riding up from the rear had followed his example
The posse surrounded the three ranchers and by now everybody wastalking at once
Look here Harran called to Annixter this wont do
dont like thelooks of this thing
They all seem to be edging up and before we knowit they may take the Governor and the other men prisonersThey ought to come back declared Annixter
Somebody ought to tell them that those fellows are creeping upBy now the angry argument between the Governor and Ruggles had becomemore heated than ever
Their voices were raised now and then they madefurious gestures
They ought to come back cried Osterman
We couldnt shoot now ifanything should happen for fear of hitting themWell it sounds as though something were going to happen pretty soonThey could hear Gethings and Delaney wrangling furiously another deputyjoined in
Im going to call the Governor back exclaimed Annixter suddenlyclambering out of the ditch
No no cried Osterman keep in theditch
They cant drive us out if we keep hereHooven and Harran who had instinctively followed Annixter hesitatedat Ostermans words and the three halted irresolutely on the road beforethe ditch their weapons in their hands
Governor shouted Harran come on back
You cant do anythingStill the wrangle continued and one of the deputies advancing littlefrom out the group cried outKeep back there
Keep back there youGo to hell will you shouted Harran on the instant
Youre on mylandOh come back here Harran called Osterman
That aint going to doany goodTherelisten suddenly exclaimed Harran
The Governor is calling us
Come on Im goingOsterman got out of the ditch and came forward catching Harran by thearm and pulling him back
He didnt call
Dont get excited
Youll ruin everything
Get backinto the ditch againBut Cutter Phelps and the old man Dabney misunderstanding whatwas happening and seeing Osterman leave the ditch had followed hisexample
All the Leaguers were now out of the ditch and little waydown the road Hooven Osterman Annixter and Harran in front DabneyPhelps and Cutter coming up from behind
Keep back you cried the deputy again
In the group around Behrmans buggy Gethings and Delaney were yetquarrelling and the angry debate between Magnus Garnett and themarshal still continued
Till this moment the real estate broker Christian had taken no partin the argument but had kept himself in the rear of the buggy
Nowhowever he pushed forward
There was but little room for him to passand as he rode by the buggy his horse scraped his flank against thehub of the wheel
The animal recoiled sharply and striking againstGarnett threw him to the ground
Delaneys horse stood between thebuggy and the Leaguers gathered on the road in front of the ditch theincident indistinctly seen by them was misinterpreted
Garnett had not yet risen when Hooven raised great shoutHOCH DER KAISER
HOCH DER VATERLANDWith the words he dropped to one knee and sighting his riflecarefully fired into the group of men around the buggy
Instantly the revolvers and rifles seemed to go off of themselves
Bothsides deputies and Leaguers opened fire simultaneously
At first itwas nothing but confused roar of explosions then the roar lapsed toan irregular quick succession of reports shot leaping after shotthen moments silence and last of all regular as clockticks threeshots at exact intervals
Then stillness
Delaney shot through the stomach slid down from his horse and onhis hands and knees crawled from the road into the standing wheat
Christian fell backward from the saddle toward the buggy and hungsuspended in that position his head and shoulders on the wheel onestiff leg still across his saddle
Hooven in attempting to rise fromhis kneeling position received rifle ball squarely in the throat androlled forward upon his face
Old Broderson crying out Oh theyveshot me boys staggered sideways his head bent his hands rigid athis sides and fell into the ditch
Osterman blood running from hismouth and nose turned about and walked back
Presley helped him acrossthe irrigating ditch and Osterman laid himself down his head on hisfolded arms
Harran Derrick dropped where he stood turning over on hisface and lay motionless groaning terribly pool of blood formingunder his stomach
The old man Dabney silent as ever received hisdeath speechless
He fell to his knees got up again fell once moreand died without word
Annixter instantly killed fell his lengthto the ground and lay without movement just as he had fallen one armacross his face
CHAPTER VIIOn their way to Derricks ranch house Hilma and Mrs Derrick heard thesounds of distant firing
Stop cried Hilma laying her hand upon young Vaccas arm
Stop thehorses
Listen what was thatThe carryall came to halt and from far away across the rustling wheatcame the faint rattle of rifles and revolvers
Say cried Vacca rolling his eyes oh say theyre fighting overthereMrs Derrick put her hands over her face
Fighting she cried oh oh its terrible
Magnus is thereandHarranWhere do you think it is demanded Hilma
Thats over towardHoovensIm going
Turn back
Drive to Hoovens quickBetter not Mrs Annixter protested the young man
Annixter saidwe were to go to Derricks
Better keep away from Hoovens if therestrouble there
We wouldnt get there till its all over anyhowYes yes lets go home cried Mrs Derrick Im afraid
Oh HilmaIm afraidCome with me to Hoovens thenThere where they are fighting
Oh couldnt
II cant
It would beall over before we got there as Vacca saysSure repeated young Vacca
Drive to Hoovens commanded Hilma
If you wont Ill walk there She threw off the laprobes preparing to descend
And you sheexclaimed turning to Mrs Derrick how CAN youwhen Harran and yourhusband may bemayare in dangerGrumbling Vacca turned the carryall about and drove across the openfields till he reached the road to Guadalajara just below the Mission
Hurry cried Hilma
The horses started forward under the touch of the whip
The ranch housesof Quien Sabe came in sight
Do you want to stop at the house inquired Vacca over his shoulder
No no oh go fastermake the horses runThey dashed through the houses of the Home ranch
Oh oh cried Hilma suddenly look look there
Look what they havedoneVacca pulled the horses up for the road in front of Annixters housewas blocked
vast confused heap of household effects was therechairs sofaspictures fixtures lamps
Hilmas little home had been guttedeverything had been taken from it and ruthlessly flung out upon theroad everything that she and her husband had bought during thatwonderful week after their marriage
Here was the white enamelled set of the bedroom furniture the three chairs washstand and bureauthebureau drawers falling out spilling their contents into the dust therewere the white wool rugs of the sittingroom the flower stand with itspots all broken its flowers wilting the cracked goldfish globe thefishes already dead the rocking chair the sewing machine the greatround table of yellow oak the lamp with its deep shade of crinklyred tissue paper the pretty tinted photographs that had hung on thewallthe choir boys with beautiful eyes the pensive young girls inpink gownsthe pieces of wood carving that represented quails andducks and last of all its curtains of crisp clean muslin cruellytorn and crushedthe bed the wonderful canopied bed so brave and gayof which Hilma had been so proud thrust out there into the common roadtorn from its place from the discreet intimacy of her bridal chamberviolated profaned flung out into the dust and garish sunshine for allmen to stare at mockery and shame
To Hilma it was as though something of herself of her person had beenthus exposed and degraded all that she held sacred pilloried gibbetedand exhibited to the worlds derision
Tears of anguish sprang to hereyes red flame of outraged modesty overspread her face
Oh she cried sob catching her throat oh how could they do it But other fears intruded other greater terrors impended
Go on she cried to Vacca go on quicklyBut Vacca would go no further
He had seen what had escaped Hilmasattention two men deputies no doubt on the porch of the ranch house
They held possession there and the evidence of the presence of theenemy in this raid upon Quien Sabe had daunted him
No SIR he declared getting out of the carryall aint going totake you anywhere where youre liable to get hurt
Besides the roadsblocked by all this stuff
You cant get the team byHilma sprang from the carryall
Come she said to Mrs Derrick
The older woman trembling hesitating faint with dread obeyed andHilma picking her way through and around the wreck of her home set offby the trail towards the Long Trestle and Hoovens
When she arrived she found the road in front of the Germans houseand indeed all the surrounding yard crowded with people
Anoverturned buggy lay on the side of the road in the distance its horsesin tangle of harness held by two or three men
She saw Carahersbuckboard under the live oak and near it second buggy which sherecognised as belonging to doctor in Guadalajara
Oh what has happened oh what has happened moaned Mrs Derrick
Come repeated Hilma
The young girl took her by the hand and togetherthey pushed their way through the crowd of men and women and entered theyard
The throng gave way before the two women parting to right and leftwithout word
Presley cried Mrs Derrick as she caught sight of him in the doorwayof the house oh Presley what has happened
Is Harran safe
Is Magnussafe
Where are theyDont go in Mrs Derrick said Presley coming forward dont goinWhere is my husband demanded Hilma
Presley turned away and steadied himself against the jamb of the door
Hilma leaving Mrs Derrick entered the house
The front room was fullof men
She was dimly conscious of Cyrus Ruggles and Behrman bothdeadly pale talking earnestly and in whispers to Cutter and Phelps
There was strange acrid odour of an unfamiliar drug in the air
On the table before her was satchel surgical instruments rolls ofbandages and blue oblong paper box full of cotton
But above thehushed noises of voices and footsteps one terrible sound made itselfheardthe prolonged rasping sound of breathing half choked labouredagonised
Where is my husband she cried
She pushed the men aside
She sawMagnus bareheaded three or four men lying on the floor one halfnaked his body swathed in white bandages the doctor in shirt sleeveson one knee beside figure of man stretched out beside him
Garnett turned white face to her
Where is my husbandThe other did not reply but stepped aside and Hilma saw the dead bodyof her husband lying upon the bed
She did not cry out
She said noword
She went to the bed and sitting upon it took Annixters headin her lap holding it gently between her hands
Thereafter she didnot move but sat holding her dead husbands head in her lap lookingvaguely about from face to face of those in the room while withouta sob without cry the great tears filled her wideopened eyes androlled slowly down upon her cheeks
On hearing that his wife was outside Magnus came quickly forward
Shethrew herself into his arms
Tell me tell me she cried is HarranisWe dont know yet he answered
Oh AnnieThen suddenly the Governor checked himself
He the indomitable couldnot break down now
The doctor is with him he said we are doing all we can
Try and bebrave Annie
There is always hope
This is terrible days work
Godforgive us allShe pressed forward but he held her back
No dont see him now
Go into the next room
Garnett take care ofherBut she would not be denied
She pushed by Magnus and breakingthrough the group that surrounded her son sank on her knees beside himmoaning in compassion and terror
Harran lay straight and rigid upon the floor his head propped by apillow his coat that had been taken off spread over his chest
One legof his trousers was soaked through and through with blood
His eyes werehalfclosed and with the regularity of machine the eyeballs twitchedand twitched
His face was so white that it made his yellow hair lookbrown while from his opened mouth there issued that loud and terriblesound of guttering rasping laboured breathing that gagged and chokedand gurgled with every inhalation
Oh Harrie Harrie called Mrs Derrick catching at one of his hands
The doctor shook his head
He is unconscious Mrs DerrickWhere was hewhere isthetheThrough the lungsWill he get well
Tell me the truthI dont know
Mrs DerrickShe had all but fainted and the old rancher Garnett halfcarryinghalfleading her took her to the one adjoining roomMinna Hoovensbedchamber
Dazed numb with fear she sat down on the edge of the bedrocking herself back and forth murmuringHarrie Harrie oh my son my little boyIn the outside room Presley came and went doing what he could to be ofservice sick with horror trembling from head to foot
The surviving members of both Leaguers and deputiesthe warringfactions of the Railroad and the Peoplemingled together now with nothought of hostility
Presley helped the doctor to cover Christiansbody
Behrman and Ruggles held bowls of water while Osterman wasattended to
The horror of that dreadful business had driven all otherconsiderations from the mind
The sworn foes of the last hour had nothought of anything but to care for those whom in their fury they hadshot down
The marshal abandoning for that day the attempt to serve thewrits departed for San Francisco
The bodies had been brought in from the road where they fell
Annixterscorpse had been laid upon the bed those of Dabney and Hoovenwhose wounds had all been in the face and head were covered with atablecloth
Upon the floor places were made for the others
Cutterand Ruggles rode into Guadalajara to bring out the doctor there and totelephone to Bonneville for others
Osterman had not at any time since the shooting lost consciousness
He lay upon the floor of Hoovens house bare to the waist bandagesof adhesive tape reeved about his abdomen and shoulder
His eyes werehalfclosed
Presley who looked after him pending the arrival of ahack from Bonneville that was to take him home knew that he was inagony
But this poser this silly fellow this cracker of jokes whom no onehad ever taken very seriously at the last redeemed himself
When atlength the doctor had arrived he had for the first time opened hiseyes
can wait he said
Take Harran first And when at length his turnhad come and while the sweat rolled from his forehead as the doctorbegan probing for the bullet he had reached out his free arm and takenPresleys hand in his gripping it harder and harder as the probeentered the wound
His breath came short through his nostrils his facethe face of comic actor with its high cheek bones bald foreheadand salient ears grew paler and paler his great slit of mouth shuttight but he uttered no groan
When the worst anguish was over and he could find breath to speak hisfirst words had beenWere any of the others badly hurtAs Presley stood by the door of the house after bringing in pail ofwater for the doctor he was aware of party of men who had struckoff from the road on the other side of the irrigating ditch and wereadvancing cautiously into the field of wheat
He wondered what it meantand Cutter coming up at that moment Presley asked him if he knew
Its Delaney said Cutter
It seems that when he was shot he crawledoff into the wheat
They are looking for him therePresley had forgotten all about the buster and had only vaguerecollection of seeing him slide from his horse at the beginning of thefight
Anxious to know what had become of him he hurried up and joinedthe party of searchers
We better look out said one of the young men how we go foolingaround in here
If hes alive yet hes just as liable as not to thinkwere after him and take shot at usI guess there aint much fight left in him another answered
Look atthe wheat hereLord
Hes bled like stuck pigHeres his hat abruptly exclaimed the leader of the party
He cantbe far off
Lets call himThey called repeatedly without getting any answer then proceededcautiously
All at once the men in advance stopped so suddenly thatthose following carromed against them
There was an outburst ofexclamation
Here he isGood Lord
Sure thats himPoor fellow poor fellowThe cowpuncher lay on his back deep in the wheat his knees drawn uphis eyes wide open his lips brown
Rigidly gripped in one hand was hisempty revolver
The men farm hands from the neighbouring ranches young fellows fromGuadalajara drew back in instinctive repulsion
One at length venturednear peering down into the face
Is he dead inquired those in the rear
dont knowWell put your hand on his heart No
II dont want toWhat you afraid ofWell just dont want to touch him thats all
Its bad luck
YOUfeel his heartYou cant always tell by thatHow can you tell then
Pshaw you fellows make me sick
Here let meget there
Ill do itThere was long pause as the other bent down and laid his hand on thecowpunchers breast
WellI cant tell
Sometimes think feel it beat and sometimes dont
Inever saw dead man beforeWell you cant tell by the heartWhats the good of talking so blame much
Dead or not lets carry himback to the houseTwo or three ran back to the road for planks from the broken bridge
When they returned with these litter was improvised and throwingtheir coats over the body the party carried it back to the road
Thedoctor was summoned and declared the cowpuncher to have been dead overhalf an hour
What did tell you exclaimed one of the group
Well never said he wasnt dead protested the other
only saidyou couldnt always tell by whether his heart beat or notBut all at once there was commotion
The wagon containing Mrs HoovenMinna and little Hilda drove up
Eh den my men cried Mrs Hooven wildly interrogating the faces ofthe crowd
Whadt has happun
Sey den dose vellers hev dey hurdt mymen eh whadtShe sprang from the wagon followed by Minna with Hilda in her arms
Thecrowd bore back as they advanced staring at them in silence
Eh whadt has happun whadt has happun wailed Mrs Hooven as shehurried on her two hands out before her the fingers spread wide
EhHooven eh my men are you alle righdtShe burst into the house
Hoovens body had been removed to an adjoiningroom the bedroom of the house and to this room Mrs HoovenMinnastill at her heelsproceeded guided by an instinct born of theoccasion
Those in the outside room saying no word made way for them
They entered closing the door behind them and through all the restof that terrible day no sound nor sight of them was had by those whocrowded into and about that house of death
Of all the main actors ofthe tragedy of the fight in the ditch they remained the least notedobtruded themselves the least upon the worlds observation
They werefor the moment forgotten
But by now Hoovens house was the centre of an enormous crowd
vastconcourse of people from Bonneville from Guadalajara from the ranchesswelled by the thousands who had that morning participated in the rabbitdrive surged about the place men and women young boys young girlsfarm hands villagers townspeople ranchers railroad employeesMexicans Spaniards Portuguese
Presley returning from the search forDelaneys body had to fight his way to the house again
And from all this multitude there rose an indefinable murmur
Asyet there was no menace in it no anger
It was confusion merelybewilderment the first longdrawn oh that greets the news of somegreat tragedy
The people had taken no thought as yet
Curiosity wastheir dominant impulse
Every one wanted to see what had been donefailing that to hear of it and failing that to be near the scene ofthe affair
The crowd of people packed the road in front of the housefor nearly quarter of mile in either direction
They balancedthemselves upon the lower strands of the barbed wire fence in theireffort to see over each others shoulders they stood on the seats oftheir carts buggies and farm wagons few even upon the saddles oftheir riding horses
They crowded pushed struggled surged forward andback without knowing why converging incessantly upon Hoovens house
When at length Presley got to the gate he found carryall drawn upbefore it
Between the gate and the door of the house lane had beenformed and as he paused there moment group of Leaguers amongwhom were Garnett and Gethings came slowly from the door carryingold Broderson in their arms
The doctor bareheaded and in his shirtsleeves squinting in the sunlight attended them repeating at everystepSlow slow take it easy gentlemenOld Broderson was unconscious
His face was not pale no bandages couldbe seen
With infinite precautions the men bore him to the carryalland deposited him on the back seat the rain flaps were let down on oneside to shut off the gaze of the multitude
But at this point moment of confusion ensued
Presley because of halfa dozen people who stood in his way could not see what was going on
There were exclamations hurried movements
The doctor uttered sharpcommand and man ran back to the house returning on the instant withthe doctors satchel
By this time Presley was close to the wheels ofthe carryall and could see the doctor inside the vehicle bending overold Broderson
Here it is here it is exclaimed the man who had been sent to thehouse
wont need it answered the doctor hes dying nowAt the words great hush widened throughout the throng near at hand
Some men took off their hats
Stand back protested the doctor quietly stand back good peoplepleaseThe crowd bore back little
In the silence woman began to sob
Theseconds passed then minute
The horses of the carryall shifted theirfeet and whisked their tails driving off the flies
At length thedoctor got down from the carryall letting down the rainflaps on thatside as well
Will somebody go home with the body he asked
Gethings steppedforward and took his place by the driver
The carryall drove away
Presley reentered the house
During his absence it had been cleared ofall but one or two of the Leaguers who had taken part in the fight
Hilma still sat on the bed with Annixters head in her lap
BehrmanRuggles and all the railroad party had gone
Osterman had been takenaway in hack and the tablecloth over Dabneys body replaced witha sheet
But still unabated agonised raucous came the sounds ofHarrans breathing
Everything possible had already been done
For themoment it was out of the question to attempt to move him
His mother andfather were at his side Magnus with face of stone his look fixed onthose persistently twitching eyes Annie Derrick crouching at her sonsside one of his hands in hers fanning his face continually with thecrumpled sheet of an old newspaper
Presley on tiptoes joined the group looking on attentively
One of thesurgeons who had been called from Bonneville stood close by watchingHarrans face his arms folded
How is he Presley whispered
He wont live the other responded
By degrees the choke and gurgle of the breathing became more irregularand the lids closed over the twitching eyes
All at once the breathceased
Magnus shot an inquiring glance at the surgeon
He is dead Mr Derrick the surgeon replied
Annie Derrick with cry that rang through all the house stretchedherself over the body of her son her head upon his breast and theGovernors great shoulders bowed never to rise again
God help me and forgive me he groaned
Presley rushed from the house beside himself with grief with horrorwith pity and with mad insensate rage
On the porch outside Carahermet him
Is heis he began the saloonkeeper
Yes hes dead cried Presley
Theyre all dead murdered shot downdead dead all of them
Whose turn is nextThats the way they killed my wife PresleyCaraher cried Presley give me your hand
Ive been wrong all thetime
The League is wrong
All the world is wrong
You are the only oneof us all who is right
Im with you from now on
BY GOD TOO IM AREDIn course of time farm wagon from Bonneville arrived at Hoovens
Thebodies of Annixter and Harran were placed in it and it drove down theLower Road towards the Los Muertos ranch houses
The bodies of Delaney and Christian had already been carried toGuadalajara and thence taken by train to Bonneville
Hilma followed the farm wagon in the Derricks carryall with Magnusand his wife
During all that ride none of them spoke word
It hadbeen arranged that since Quien Sabe was in the hands of the RailroadHilma should come to Los Muertos
To that place also Annixters body wascarried
Later on in the day when it was almost evening the undertakers blackwagon passed the Derricks Home ranch on its way from Hoovens andturned into the county road towards Bonneville
The initial excitementof the affair of the irrigating ditch had died down the crowd longsince had dispersed
By the time the wagon passed Carahers saloon thesun had set
Night was coming on
And the black wagon went on through the darkness unattended ignoredsolitary carrying the dead body of Dabney the silent old man of whomnothing was known but his name who made no friends whom nobody knew orspoke to who had come from no one knew whence and who went no one knewwhither
Towards midnight of that same day Mrs Dyke was awakened by the soundsof groaning in the room next to hers
Magnus Derrick was not sooccupied by Harrans death that he could not think of others who were indistress and when he had heard that Mrs Dyke and Sidney like Hilmahad been turned out of Quien Sabe he had thrown open Los Muertos tothem
Though he warned them it is precarious hospitality at the bestUntil late Mrs Dyke had sat up with Hilma comforting her as best shecould rocking her to and fro in her arms crying with her trying toquiet her for once having given way to her grief Hilma wept with aterrible anguish and violence that racked her from head to foot andat last worn out little child again had sobbed herself to sleep inthe older womans arms and as little child Mrs Dyke had put her tobed and had retired herself
Aroused few hours later by the sounds of distress that was physicalas well as mental Mrs Dyke hurried into Hilmas room carrying thelamp with her
Mrs Dyke needed no enlightenment
She woke Presley andbesought him to telephone to Bonneville at once summoning doctor
That night Hilma in great pain suffered miscarriage
Presley did not close his eyes once during the night he did not evenremove his clothes
Long after the doctor had departed and that houseof tragedy had quieted down he still remained in his place by the openwindow of his little room looking off across the leagues of growingwheat watching the slow kindling of the dawn
Horror weighedintolerably upon him
Monstrous things huge terrible whose names heknew only too well whirled at gallop through his imagination or rosespectral and grisly before the eyes of his mind
Harran dead Annixterdead Broderson dead Osterman perhaps even at that moment dying
Why these men had made up his world
Annixter had been his best friendHarran his almost daily companion Broderson and Osterman were familiarto him as brothers
They were all his associates his good friends thegroup was his environment belonging to his daily life
And he standingthere in the dust of the road by the irrigating ditch had seen themshot
He found himself suddenly at his table the candle burning athis elbow his journal before him writing swiftly the desire forexpression the craving for outlet to the thoughts that clamouredtumultuous at his brain never more insistent more imperious
Thus hewroteDabney dead Hooven dead Harran dead Annixter dead Broderson deadOsterman dying Behrman alive successful the Railroad in possessionof Quien Sabe
saw them shot
Not twelve hours since stood there atthe irrigating ditch
Ah that terrible moment of horror and confusion
powder smokeflashing pistol barrelsblood stainsrearing horsesmenstaggering to their deathChristian in horrible posture one rigidleg high in the air across his saddleBroderson falling sideways intothe ditchOsterman laying himself down his head on his arms as iftired tired out
These things have seen them
The picture of thisdays work is from henceforth part of my mind part of ME
They havedone it Behrman and the owners of the railroad have done it whileall the world looked on while the people of these United States lookedon
Oh come now and try your theories upon us us of the ranchos uswho have suffered us who KNOW
Oh talk to US now of the rightsof Capital talk to US of the Trust talk to US of the equilibriumbetween the classes
Try your ingenious ideas upon us
WE KNOW
Icannot tell whether or not your theories are excellent
do not know ifyour ideas are plausible
do not know how practical is your scheme ofsociety
do not know if the Railroad has right to our lands but IDO know that Harran is dead that Annixter is dead that Broderson isdead that Hooven is dead that Osterman is dying and that Behrmanis alive successful triumphant that he has ridden into possession ofa principality over the dead bodies of five men shot down by his hiredassociates
can see the outcome
The Railroad will prevail
The Trust willoverpower us
Here in this corner of great nation here on the edgeof the continent here in this valley of the West far from the greatcentres isolated remote lost the great iron hand crushes life fromus crushes liberty and the pursuit of happiness from us and our littlestruggles our moments convulsion of death agony causes not one jar inthe vast clashing machinery of the nations life fleck of grit inthe wheels perhaps grain of sand in the cogsthe momentary creakof the axle is the mothers wail of bereavement the wifes cry ofanguishand the great wheel turns spinning smooth again even againand the tiny impediment of second scarce noticed is forgotten
Makethe people believe that the faint tremour in their great engine is amenace to its function
What folly to think of it
Tell them of thedanger and they will laugh at you
Tell them five years from nowthe story of the fight between the League of the San Joaquin and theRailroad and it will not be believed
pitched battle betweenFarmer and Railroad battle that cost the lives of seven men
Impossible it could not have happened
Your story is fictionisexaggerated
Yet it is LexingtonGod help us God enlighten us God rouse us fromour lethargyit is Lexington farmers with guns in their hands fightingfor Liberty
Is our State of California the only one that has itsancient and hereditary foe
Are there no other Trusts between the oceansthan this of the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad
Ask yourselves youof the Middle West ask yourselves you of the North ask yourselvesyou of the East ask yourselves you of the Southask yourselves everycitizen of every State from Maine to Mexico from the Dakotas to theCarolinas have you not the monster in your boundaries
If it is not aTrust of transportation it is only another head of the same Hydra
Is not our death struggle typical
Is it not one of many is itnot symbolical of the great and terrible conflict that is going oneverywhere in these United States
Ah you people blind boundtricked betrayed can you not see it
Can you not see how the monstershave plundered your treasures and holding them in the grip of theiriron claws dole them out to you only at the price of your blood at theprice of the lives of your wives and your little children
You give yourbabies to Moloch for the loaf of bread you have kneaded yourselves
You offer your starved wives to Juggernaut for the iron nail you haveyourselves compoundedHe spent the night over his journal writing down such thoughts asthese or walking the floor from wall to wall or seized at times withunreasoning horror and blind rage flinging himself face downward uponhis bed vowing with inarticulate cries that neither Behrman norShelgrim should ever live to consummate their triumph
Morning came and with it the daily papers and news
Presley did not evenglance at the Mercury Bonneville published two other daily journalsthat professed to voice the will and reflect the temper of the peopleand these he read eagerly
Osterman was yet alive and there were chances of his recovery
TheLeaguesome three hundred of its members had gathered at Bonnevilleover night and were patrolling the streets and still resolved tokeep the peace were even guarding the railroad shops and buildings
Furthermore the Leaguers had issued manifestoes urging all citizensto preserve law and order yet summoning an indignation meeting to beconvened that afternoon at the City Opera House
It appeared from the newspapers that those who obstructed the marshalin the discharge of his duty could be proceeded against by the DistrictAttorney on information or by bringing the matter before the Grand Jury
But the Grand Jury was not at that time in session and it was knownthat there were no funds in the marshals office to pay expenses for thesummoning of jurors or the serving of processes
Behrman and Rugglesin interviews stated that the Railroad withdrew entirely from the fightthe matter now according to them was between the Leaguers and theUnited States Government they washed their hands of the whole business
The ranchers could settle with Washington
But it seemed that Congresshad recently forbade the use of troops for civil purposes the wholematter of the LeagueRailroad contest was evidently for the moment to beleft in status quo
But to Presleys mind the most important piece of news that morning wasthe report of the action of the Railroad upon hearing of the battle
Instantly Bonneville had been isolated
Not single local train wasrunning not one of the through trains made any halt at the station
Themails were not moved
Further than this by some arrangement difficultto understand the telegraph operators at Bonneville and Guadalajaraacting under orders refused to receive any telegrams except thoseemanating from railway officials
The story of the fight the storycreating the first impression was to be told to San Francisco and theoutside world by Behrman Ruggles and the local and agents
An hour before breakfast the undertakers arrived and took charge of thebodies of Harran and Annixter
Presley saw neither Hilma Magnus norMrs Derrick
The doctor came to look after Hilma
He breakfasted withMrs Dyke and Presley and from him Presley learned that Hilma wouldrecover both from the shock of her husbands death and from hermiscarriage of the previous night
She ought to have her mother with her said the physician
She doesnothing but call for her or beg to be allowed to go to her
have triedto get wire through to Mrs Tree but the company will not take itand even if could get word to her how could she get down here
Thereare no trainsBut Presley found that it was impossible for him to stay at Los Muertosthat day
Gloom and the shadow of tragedy brooded heavy over the place
great silence pervaded everything silence broken only by thesubdued coming and going of the undertaker and his assistants
WhenPresley having resolved to go into Bonneville came out through thedoorway of the house he found the undertaker tying long strip ofcrape to the bellhandle
Presley saddled his pony and rode into town
By this time after longhours of continued reflection upon one subject sombre broodingmalevolence deepseated desire of revenge had grown big within hismind
The first numbness had passed off familiarity with what had beendone had blunted the edge of horror and now the impulse of retaliationprevailed
At first the sullen anger of defeat the sense of outragehad only smouldered but the more he brooded the fiercer flamed hisrage
Sudden paroxysms of wrath gripped him by the throat abruptoutbursts of fury injected his eyes with blood
He ground his teeth hismouth filled with curses his hands clenched till they grew white andbloodless
Was the Railroad to triumph then in the end
After all thosemonths of preparation after all those grandiloquent resolutions afterall the arrogant presumption of the League
The League
what farcewhat had it amounted to when the crisis came
Was the Trust to crushthem all so easily
Was Behrman to swallow Los Muertos
Presley saw him plainly huge rotund white saw his jowl tremulous andobese the roll of fat over his collar sprinkled with sparse hairs thegreat stomach with its brown linen vest and heavy watch chain of hollowlinks clinking against the buttons of imitation pearl
And this man wasto crush Magnus Derrickhad already stamped the life from such men asHarran and Annixter
This man in the name of the Trust was to grab LosMuertos as he had grabbed Quien Sabe and after Los Muertos Brodersonsranch then Ostermans then others and still others the whole valleythe whole State
Presley beat his forehead with his clenched fist as he rode on
No he cried no kill him kill him kill him with my handsThe idea of it put him beside himself
Oh to sink his fingers deep intothe white fat throat of the man to clutch like iron into the greatpuffed jowl of him to wrench out the life to batter it out strangleit out to pay him back for the long years of extortion and oppressionto square accounts for bribed jurors bought judges corruptedlegislatures to have justice for the trick of the Ranchers RailroadCommission the charlatanism of the ten per cent
cut the ruin ofDyke the seizure of Quien Sabe the murder of Harran the assassinationof Annixter
It was in such mood that he reached Carahers
The saloonkeeper hadjust opened his place and was standing in his doorway smoking his pipe
Presley dismounted and went in and the two had long talk
When three hours later Presley came out of the saloon and rodeon towards Bonneville his face was very pale his lips shut tightresolute determined
His manner was that of man whose mind is madeup
The hour for the mass meeting at the Opera House had been set forone oclock but long before noon the street in front of the buildingand in fact all the streets in its vicinity were packed from side toside with shifting struggling surging and excited multitude
Therewere few women in the throng but hardly single male inhabitant ofeither Bonneville or Guadalajara was absent
Men had even come fromVisalia and Pixley
It was no longer the crowd of curiosity seekers thathad thronged around Hoovens place by the irrigating ditch the Peoplewere no longer confused bewildered
full realisation of just what hadbeen done the day before was clear now in the minds of all
Business wassuspended nearly all the stores were closed
Since early morning themembers of the League had put in an appearance and rode from point topoint their rifles across their saddle pommels
Then by ten oclockthe streets had begun to fill up the groups on the corners grewand merged into one another pedestrians unable to find room onthe sidewalks took to the streets
Hourly the crowd increased tillshoulders touched and elbows till free circulation became impeded thencongested then impossible
The crowd solid mass was wedged tightfrom store front to store front
And from all this throng this singleunit this living breathing organismthe Peoplethere rose droningterrible note
It was not yet the wild fierce clamour of riot andinsurrection shrill high pitched but it was beginning the growl ofthe awakened brute feeling the iron in its flank heaving up its headwith bared teeth the throat vibrating to the long indrawn snarl ofwrath
Thus the forenoon passed while the people their bulk growing hourlyvaster kept to the streets moving slowly backward and forwardoscillating in the grooves of the thoroughfares the steady lowpitchedgrowl rising continually into the hot still air
Then at length about twelve oclock the movement of the throngassumed definite direction
It set towards the Opera House
Presley whohad left his pony at the City livery stable found himself caught inthe current and carried slowly forward in its direction
His arms werepinioned to his sides by the press the crush against his body was allbut ribcracking he could hardly draw his breath
All around him roseand fell wave after wave of faces hundreds upon hundreds thousandsupon thousands red lowering sullen
All were set in one direction andslowly slowly they advanced crowding closer till they almost touchedone another
For reasons that were inexplicable great tumultuousheavings like groundswells of an incoming tide surged over andthrough the multitude
At times Presley lifted from his feet wasswept back back back with the crowd till the entrance of the OperaHouse was half block away then the returning billow beat back againand swung him along gasping staggering clutching till he was landedonce more in the vortex of frantic action in front of the foyer
Herethe waves were shorter quicker the crushing pressure on all sides ofhis body left him without strength to utter the cry that rose to hislips then suddenly the whole mass of struggling stampingfighting writhing men about him seemed as it were to rise to liftmultitudinous swelling gigantic
mighty rush dashed Presley forwardin its leap
There was moments whirl of confused sights congestedfaces opened mouths bloodshot eyes clutching hands momentsoutburst of furious sound shouts cheers oaths moments jam whereinPresley veritably believed his ribs must snap like pipestems and hewas carried dazed breathless helpless an atom on the crest ofa stormdriven wave up the steps of the Opera House on into thevestibule through the doors and at last into the auditorium of thehouse itself
There was mad rush for places men disdaining the aisle steppedfrom one orchestra chair to another striding over the backs of seatsleaving the print of dusty feet upon the red plush cushions
In atwinkling the house was filled from stage to topmost gallery
Theaisles were packed solid even on the edge of the stage itself men weresitting black fringe on either side of the footlights
The curtain was up disclosing halfset scenethe flats leaning atperilous anglesthat represented some sort of terrace the pavementalternate squares of black and white marble while red white andyellow flowers were represented as growing from urns and vases
longdouble row of chairs stretched across the scene from wing to wingflanking table covered with red cloth on which was set pitcher ofwater and speakers gavel
Promptly these chairs were filled up with members of the Leaguethe audience cheering as certain wellknown figures made theirappearanceGarnett of the Ruby ranch Gethings of the San Pablo Keastof the ranch of the same name Chattern of the Bonanza elderly menbearded slow of speech deliberate
Garnett opened the meeting his speech was plain straightforwardmatteroffact
He simply told what had happened
He announced thatcertain resolutions were to be drawn up
He introduced the next speaker
This one pleaded for moderation
He was conservative
All along he hadopposed the idea of armed resistance except as the very last resort
He deplored the terrible affair of yesterday
He begged the peopleto wait in patience to attempt no more violence
He informed them thatarmed guards of the League were at that moment patrolling Los MuertosBrodersons and Ostermans
It was well known that the United Statesmarshal confessed himself powerless to serve the writs
There would beno more bloodshed
We have had he continued bloodshed enough and want to say righthere that am not so sure but what yesterdays terrible affair mighthave been avoided
gentleman whom we all esteem who from the firsthas been our recognised leader is at this moment mourning the loss ofa young son killed before his eyes
God knows that sympathise as dowe all in the affliction of our President
am sorry for him
My heartgoes out to him in this hour of distress but at the same time theposition of the League must be defined
We owe it to ourselves we oweit to the people of this county
The League armed for the very purposeof preserving the peace not of breaking it
We believed that with sixhundred armed and drilled men at our disposal ready to muster at amoments call we could so overawe any attempt to expel us from ourlands that such an attempt would not be made until the cases pendingbefore the Supreme Court had been decided
If when the enemy appeared inour midst yesterday they had been met by six hundred rifles it is notconceivable that the issue would have been forced
No fight would haveensued and today we would not have to mourn the deaths of four of ourfellowcitizens
mistake has been made and we of the League must notbe held responsibleThe speaker sat down amidst loud applause from the Leaguers and lesspronounced demonstrations on the part of the audience
second Leaguer took his place tall clumsy man halfrancherhalfpolitician
want to second what my colleague has just said he began
Thismatter of resisting the marshal when he tried to put the Railroaddummies in possession on the ranches around here was all talked overin the committee meetings of the League long ago
It never was ourintention to fire single shot
No such absolute authority as wasassumed yesterday was delegated to anybody
Our esteemed President isall right but we all know that he is man who loves authority and wholikes to go his own gait without accounting to anybody
Wethe rest ofus Leaguersnever were informed as to what was going on
We supposedof course that watch was being kept on the Railroad so as we wouldntbe taken by surprise as we were yesterday
And it seems no watch waskept at all or if there was it was mighty ineffective
Our idea was toforestall any movement on the part of the Railroad and then when weknew the marshal was coming down to call meeting of our ExecutiveCommittee and decide as to what should be done
We ought to have hadtime to call out the whole League
Instead of that what happens
Whilewere all off chasing rabbits the Railroad is allowed to steal marchon us and when it is too late handful of Leaguers is got together anda fight is precipitated and our men killed
IM sorry for our Presidenttoo
No one is more so but want to put myself on record as believinghe did hasty and inconsiderate thing
If he had managed right hecould have had six hundred men to oppose the Railroad and there wouldnot have been any gun fight or any killing
He DIDNT manage right andthere WAS killing and dont see as how the League ought to beheld responsible
The idea of the League the whole reason why itwas organised was to protect ALL the ranches of this valley from theRailroad and it looks to me as if the lives of our fellowcitizenshad been sacrificed not in defending ALL of our ranches but just indefence of one of themLos Muertosthe one that Mr Derrick ownsThe speaker had no more than regained his seat when man was seenpushing his way from the back of the stage towards Garnett
He handedthe rancher note at the same time whispering in his ear
Garnett readthe note then came forward to the edge of the stage holding up hishand
When the audience had fallen silent he saidI have just received sad news
Our friend and fellowcitizen MrOsterman died this morning between eleven and twelve oclockInstantly there was roar
Every man in the building rose to his feetshouting gesticulating
The roar increased the Opera House trembledto it the gas jets in the lighted chandeliers vibrated to it
It was araucous howl of execration bellow of rage inarticulate deafening
tornado of confusion swept whirling from wall to wall and the madnessof the moment seized irresistibly upon Presley
He forgot himself he nolonger was master of his emotions or his impulses
All at once he foundhimself upon the stage facing the audience flaming with excitementhis imagination on fire his arms uplifted in fierce wild gestureswords leaping to his mind in torrent that could not be withheld
One more dead he cried one more
Harran dead Annixter deadBroderson dead Dabney dead Osterman dead Hooven dead shot downkilled killed in the defence of their homes killed in the defence oftheir rights killed for the sake of liberty
How long must it go on
How long must we suffer
Where is the end what is the end
How longmust the ironhearted monster feed on our lifes blood
How long mustthis terror of steam and steel ride upon our necks
Will you never besatisfied will you never relent you our masters you our lordsyou our kings you our taskmasters you our Pharoahs
Will you neverlisten to that command LET MY PEOPLE GO
Oh that cry ringing down theages
Hear it hear it
It is the voice of the Lord God speaking in hisprophets
Hear it hear itLet My people go
Rameses heard it in hispylons at Thebes Caesar heard it on the Palatine the Bourbon Louisheard it at Versailles Charles Stuart heard it at Whitehall the whiteCzar heard it in the KremlinLET MY PEOPLE GO
It is the cry of thenations the great voice of the centuries everywhere it is raised
Thevoice of God is the voice of the People
The people cry out Let us thePeople Gods people go
You our masters you our kings you ourtyrants dont you hear us
Dont you hear God speaking in us
Will younever let us go
How long at length will you abuse our patience
Howlong will you drive us
How long will you harass us
Will nothing dauntyou
Does nothing check you
Do you not know that to ignore our crytoo long is to wake the Red Terror
Rameses refused to listen to itand perished miserably
Caesar refused to listen and was stabbed inthe Senate House
The Bourbon Louis refused to listen and died on theguillotine Charles Stuart refused to listen and died on the block thewhite Czar refused to listen and was blown up in his own capital
Willyou let it come to that
Will you drive us to it
We who boast of ourland of freedom we who live in the country of liberty
Go on as youhave begun and it WILL come to that
Turn deaf ear to that cry of LetMy people go too long and another cry will be raised that you cannotchoose but hear cry that you cannot shut out
It will be the cry ofthe man on the street the la Bastille that wakes the Red Terror andunleashes Revolution
Harassed plundered exasperated desperate thepeople will turn at last as they have turned so many many times before
You our lords you our taskmasters you our kings you have caughtyour Samson you have made his strength your own
You have shornhis head you have put out his eyes you have set him to turn yourmillstones to grind the grist for your mills you have made him shameand mock
Take care oh as you love your lives take care lest someday calling upon the Lord his God he reach not out his arms for thepillars of your templesThe audience at first bewildered confused by this unexpectedinvective suddenly took fire at his last words
There was roar ofapplause then more significant than mere vociferation Presleyslisteners as he began to speak again grew suddenly silent
His nextsentences were uttered in the midst of profound stillness
They own us these taskmasters of ours they own our homes they ownour legislatures
We cannot escape from them
There is no redress
Weare told we can defeat them by the ballotbox
They own the ballotbox
We are told that we must look to the courts for redress they own thecourts
We know them for what they areruffians in politics ruffiansin finance ruffians in law ruffians in trade bribers swindlers andtricksters
No outrage too great to daunt them no petty larceny toosmall to shame them despoiling government treasury of milliondollars yet picking the pockets of farm hand of the price of loafof bread
They swindle nation of hundred million and call it Financieringthey levy blackmail and call it Commerce they corrupt legislatureand call it Politics they bribe judge and call it Law they hireblacklegs to carry out their plans and call it Organisation theyprostitute the honour of State and call it Competition
And this is America
We fought Lexington to free ourselves we foughtGettysburg to free others
Yet the yoke remains we have only shifted itto the other shoulder
We talk of libertyoh the farce of it ohthe folly of it
We tell ourselves and teach our children that we haveachieved liberty that we no longer need fight for it
Why the fight isjust beginning and so long as our conception of liberty remains as it istoday it will continue
For we conceive of Liberty in the statues we raise to her as abeautiful woman crowned victorious in bright armour and white robesa light in her uplifted handa serene calm conquering goddess
Ohthe farce of it oh the folly of it
Liberty is NOT crowned goddessbeautiful in spotless garments victorious supreme
Liberty is the ManIn the Street terrible figure rushing through powder smoke fouledwith the mud and ordure of the gutter bloody rampant brutal yellingcurses in one hand smoking rifle in the other blazing torch
Freedom is NOT given free to any who ask Liberty is not born of thegods
She is child of the People born in the very height and heat ofbattle born from death stained with blood grimed with powder
And shegrows to be not goddess but Fury fearful figure slaying friendand foe alike raging insatiable merciless the Red TerrorPresley ceased speaking
Weak shaking scarcely knowing what he wasabout he descended from the stage
prolonged explosion of applausefollowed the Opera House roaring to the roof men cheering stampingwaving their hats
But it was not intelligent applause
Instinctively ashe made his way out Presley knew that after all he had not once heldthe hearts of his audience
He had talked as he would have written forall his scorn of literature he had been literary
The men who listenedto him ranchers country people storekeepers attentive though theywere were not once sympathetic
Vaguely they had felt that here wassomething which other menmore educatedwould possibly considereloquent
They applauded vociferously but perfunctorily in order toappear to understand
Presley for all his love of the people saw clearly for one momentthat he was an outsider to their minds
He had not helped them nor theircause in the least he never would
Disappointed bewildered ashamed he made his way slowly from the OperaHouse and stood on the steps outside thoughtful his head bent
He had failed thus he told himself
In that moment of crisis that atthe time he believed had been an inspiration he had failed
The peoplewould not consider him would not believe that he could do them service
Then suddenly he seemed to remember
The resolute set of his lipsreturned once more
Pushing his way through the crowded streets he wenton towards the stable where he had left his pony
Meanwhile in the Opera House great commotion had occurred
MagnusDerrick had appeared
Only sense of enormous responsibility of gravest duty could haveprevailed upon Magnus to have left his house and the dead body of hisson that day
But he was the President of the League and never sinceits organisation had meeting of such importance as this one been held
He had been in command at the irrigating ditch the day before
It washe who had gathered the handful of Leaguers together
It was he who mustbear the responsibility of the fight
When he had entered the Opera House making his way down the centralaisle towards the stage loud disturbance had broken out partlyapplause partly meaningless uproar
Many had pressed forward to shakehis hand but others were not found wanting who formerly his staunchsupporters now scenting opposition in the air held back hesitatingafraid to compromise themselves by adhering to the fortunes of manwhose actions might be discredited by the very organisation of which hewas the head
Declining to take the chair of presiding officer which Garnett offeredhim the Governor withdrew to an angle of the stage where he was joinedby Keast
This one still unalterably devoted to Magnus acquainted him brieflywith the tenor of the speeches that had been made
am ashamed of them Governor he protested indignantly to losetheir nerve now
To fail you now
it makes my blood boil
If you hadsucceeded yesterday if all had gone well do you think we would haveheard of any talk of assumption of authority or acting withoutadvice and consent
As if there was any time to call meeting of theExecutive Committee
If you hadnt acted as you did the whole countywould have been grabbed by the Railroad
Get up Governor and bring emall up standing
Just tear em all to pieces show em that you are thehead the boss
Thats what they need
That killing yesterday has shakenthe nerve clean out of themFor the instant the Governor was taken all aback
What his lieutenantswere failing him
What he was to be questioned interpolated uponyesterdays irrepressible conflict
Had disaffection appeared inthe ranks of the Leagueat this of all moments
He put from him histerrible grief
The cause was in danger
At the instant he was thePresident of the League only the chief the master
royal angersurged within him wide towering scorn of opposition
He wouldcrush this disaffection in its incipiency would vindicate himself andstrengthen the cause at one and the same time
He stepped forward andstood in the speakers place turning partly toward the audience partlytoward the assembled Leaguers
Gentlemen of the League he began citizens of BonnevilleBut at once the silence in which the Governor had begun to speak wasbroken by shout
It was as though his words had furnished signal
Ina certain quarter of the gallery directly opposite man arose and ina voice partly of derision partly of defiance cried outHow about the bribery of those two delegates at Sacramento
Tell usabout that
Thats what we want to hear aboutA great confusion broke out
The first cry was repeated not only bythe original speaker but by whole group of which he was but part
Others in the audience however seeing in the disturbance only theclamour of few Railroad supporters attempted to howl them downhissing vigorously and exclaimingPut em out put em outOrder order called Garnett pounding with his gavel
The whole OperaHouse was in an uproar
But the interruption of the Governors speech was evidently notunpremeditated
It began to look like deliberate and planned attack
Persistently doggedly the group in the gallery vociferated Tell ushow you bribed the delegates at Sacramento
Before you throw mud at theRailroad lets see if you are clean yourselfPut em out put em outBriber briberMagnus Derrick unconvicted briber
Put him outKeast beside himself with anger pushed down the aisle underneath wherethe recalcitrant group had its place and shaking his fist called up atthemYou were paid to break up this meeting
If you have anything tosay you will be afforded the opportunity but if you do not let thegentleman proceed the police will be called upon to put you outBut at this the man who had raised the first shout leaned over thebalcony rail and his face flaming with wrath shoutedYAH
talk to me of your police
Look out we dont call on them firstto arrest your President for bribery
You and your howl about law andjustice and corruption
Herehe turned to the audienceread abouthim read the story of how the Sacramento convention was bought byMagnus Derrick President of the San Joaquin League
Heres the factsprinted and provedWith the words he stooped down and from under his seat dragged forth agreat package of extra editions of the Bonneville Mercury not an houroff the presses
Other equally large bundles of the paper appeared inthe hands of the surrounding group
The strings were cut and in handfulsand armfuls the papers were flung out over the heads of the audienceunderneath
The air was full of the flutter of the newly printed sheets
They swarmed over the rim of the gallery like clouds of monstrouswinged insects settled upon the heads and into the hands of theaudience were passed swiftly from man to man and within five minutesof the first outbreak every one in the Opera House had read Genslingersdetailed and substantiated account of Magnus Derricks deal with thepolitical bosses of the Sacramento convention
Genslinger after pocketing the Governors hush money had sold himoutKeast one quiver of indignation made his way back upon the stage
TheLeaguers were in wild confusion
Half the assembly of them were on theirfeet bewildered shouting vaguely
From proscenium wall to foyer theOpera House was tumult of noise
The gleam of the thousands of theMercury extras was like the flash of white caps on troubled sea
Keast faced the audience
Liars he shouted striving with all the power of his voice todominate the clamour liars and slanderers
Your paper is the paidorgan of the corporation
You have not one shadow of proof to back youup
Do you choose this of all times to heap your calumny upon the headof an honourable gentleman already prostrated by your murder of hisson
Proofswe demand your proofsWeve got the very assemblymen themselves came back the answeringshout
Let Derrick speak
Where is he hiding
If this is lie let himdeny it
Let HIM DISPROVE the charge Derrick Derrick thundered theOpera House
Keast wheeled about
Where was Magnus
He was not in sight upon thestage
He had disappeared
Crowding through the throng of LeaguersKeast got from off the stage into the wings
Here the crowd was no lessdense
Nearly every one had copy of the Mercury It was being readaloud to groups here and there and once Keast overheard the wordsSay wonder if this is true after allWell and even if it was cried Keast turning upon the speakerwe should be the last ones to kick
In any case it was done for ourbenefit
It elected the Ranchers CommissionA lot of benefit we got out of the Ranchers Commission retorted theother
And then protested third speaker that aint the way to doif heDID do itbribing legislatures
Why we were bucking against corruptpolitics
We couldnt afford to be corruptKeast turned away with gesture of impatience
He pushed his wayfarther on
At last opening small door in hallway back of thestage he came upon Magnus
The room was tiny
It was dressingroom
Only two nights before ithad been used by the leading actress of comic opera troupe whichhad played for three nights at Bonneville
tattered sofa and limpingtoilet table occupied third of the space
The air was heavy with thesmell of stale grease paint ointments and sachet
Faded photographsof young women in tights and gauzes ornamented the mirror and the walls
Underneath the sofa was an old pair of corsets
The spangled skirt of apink dress turned inside out hung against the wall
And in the midst of such environment surrounded by an excited groupof men who gesticulated and shouted in his very face pale alertagitated his thin lips pressed tightly together stood Magnus Derrick
Here cried Keast as he entered closing the door behind himwheres the Governor
Here Magnus Ive been looking for you
Thecrowd has gone wild out there
Youve got to talk em down
Come outthere and give those blacklegs the lie
They are saying you are hidingBut before Magnus could reply Garnett turned to Keast
Well thats what we want him to do and he wont do itYes yes cried the halfdozen men who crowded around Magnus yesthats what we want him to doKeast turned to Magnus
Why whats all this Governor he exclaimed
Youve got to answerthat
why dont you give em the lieII Magnus loosened the collar about his throat it is lie
willnot stoopI would notwould beit would be beneath mymyit wouldbe beneath meKeast stared in amazement
Was this the Great Man the Leaderindomitable of Roman integrity of Roman valour before whose voicewhole conventions had quailed
Was it possible he was AFRAID to facethose hired villifiers
Well how about this demanded Garnett suddenly
It is lie isntit
That Commission was elected honestly wasnt itHow dare you sir Magnus burst out
How dare you question mecallme to account
Please understand sir that tolerateOh quit it cried voice from the group
You cant scare usDerrick
That sort of talk was well enough once but it dont go anymore
We want yes or no answerIt was gonethat oldtime power of mastery that faculty of command
The ground crumbled beneath his feet
Long since it had been by his ownhand undermined
Authority was gone
Why keep up this miserable shamany longer
Could they not read the lie in his face in his voice
Whata folly to maintain the wretched pretence
He had failed
He was ruined
Harran was gone
His ranch would soon go his money was gone
Lymanwas worse than dead
His own honour had been prostituted
Gone goneeverything he held dear gone lost and swept away in that fiercestruggle
And suddenly and all in moment the last remaining shellsof the fabric of his being the sham that had stood already wonderfullylong cracked and collapsed
Was the Commission honestly elected insisted Garnett
Were thedelegatesdid you bribe the delegatesWe were obliged to shut our eyes to means faltered Magnus
Therewas no other way to Then suddenly and with the last dregs of hisresolution he concluded with Yes gave them two thousand dollarseachOh hell
Oh my God exclaimed Keast sitting swiftly down upon theragged sofa
There was long silence
sense of poignant embarrassment descendedupon those present
No one knew what to say or where to look
Garnettwith laboured attempt at nonchalance murmuredI see
Well thats what was trying to get at
Yes seeWell said Gethings at length bestirring himself guess ILL gohomeThere was movement
The group broke up the men making for the door
One by one they went out
The last to go was Keast
He came up to Magnusand shook the Governors limp hand
Goodbye Governor he said
Ill see you again pretty soon
Dontlet this discourage you
Theyll come around all right after while
SolongHe went out shutting the door
And seated in the one chair of the room Magnus Derrick remained longtime looking at his face in the cracked mirror that for so many yearshad reflected the painted faces of soubrettes in this atmosphere ofstale perfume and mouldy rice powder
It had comehis fall his ruin
After so many years of integrity andhonest battle his life had ended herein an actresss dressingroomdeserted by his friends his son murdered his dishonesty known an oldman broken discarded discredited and abandoned
Before nightfall ofthat day Bonneville was further excited by an astonishing bit of news
Behrman lived in detached house at some distance from the townsurrounded by grove of live oak and eucalyptus trees
At littleafter halfpast six as he was sitting down to his supper bomb wasthrown through the window of his diningroom exploding near the doorwayleading into the hall
The room was wrecked and nearly every windowof the house shattered
By miracle Behrman himself remaineduntouched
CHAPTER VIIIOn certain afternoon in the early part of July about month afterthe fight at the irrigating ditch and the mass meeting at BonnevilleCedarquist at the moment opening his mail in his office in SanFrancisco was genuinely surprised to receive visit from Presley
Well upon my word Pres exclaimed the manufacturer as the young mancame in through the door that the office boy held open for him uponmy word have you been sick
Sit down my boy
Have glass of sherry
Ialways keep bottle herePresley accepted the wine and sank into the depths of great leatherchair near by
Sick he answered
Yes have been sick
Im sick now
Im gone topieces sirHis manner was the extreme of listlessnessthe listlessness of greatfatigue
Well well observed the other
Im right sorry to hearthat
Whats the trouble PresOh nerves mostly suppose and my head and insomnia andweakness general collapse all along the line the doctor tellsme
Overcerebration he says overexcitement
fancy rathernarrowly missed brain feverWell can easily suppose it answered Cedarquist gravely after allyou have been throughPresley closed his eyesthey were sunken in circles of dark brownfleshand pressed thin hand to the back of his head
It is nightmare he murmured
frightful nightmare and its notover yet
You have heard of it all only through the newspaper reports
But down there at Bonneville at Los Muertosoh you can have no ideaof it of the misery caused by the defeat of the ranchers and by thisdecision of the Supreme Court that dispossesses them all
We had gone onhoping to the last that we would win there
We had thought that in theSupreme Court of the United States at least we could find justice
Andthe news of its decision was the worst last blow of all
For Magnus itwas the lastpositively the very lastPoor poor Derrick murmured Cedarquist
Tell me about him Pres
Howdoes he take it
What is he going to doIt beggars him sir
He sunk great deal more than any of us believedin his ranch when he resolved to turn off most of the tenants and farmthe ranch himself
Then the fight he made against the Railroad in theCourts and the political campaign he went into to get Lyman onthe Railroad Commission took more of it
The money that Genslingerblackmailed him of it seems was about all he had left
He had beengamblingyou know the Governoron another bonanza crop this year torecoup him
Well the bonanza came right enoughjust in time for SBehrman and the Railroad to grab it
Magnus is ruinedWhat tragedy
what tragedy murmured the other
Lyman turningrascal Harran killed and now this and all within so short timeallat the SAME time you might almost sayIf it had only killed him continued Presley but that is the worstof itHow the worstIm afraid honestly Im afraid it is going to turn his witssir
Its broken him oh you should see him you should see him
Ashambling stooping trembling old man in his dotage already
He sitsall day in the diningroom turning over papers sorting them tyingthem up opening them again forgetting themall fumbling and mumblingand confused
And at table sometimes he forgets to eat
And listenyou know from the house we can hear the trains whistling for the LongTrestle
As often as that happens the Governor seems to beoh dontknow frightened
He will sink his head between his shoulders as thoughhe were dodging something and he wont fetch long breath again tillthe train is out of hearing
He seems to have conceived an abjectunreasoned terror of the RailroadBut he will have to leave Los Muertos now of courseYes they will all have to leave
They have fortnight more
The fewtenants that were still on Los Muertos are leaving
That is one thingthat brings me to the city
The family of one of the men who waskilledHooven was his namehave come to the city to find work
Ithink they are liable to be in great distress unless they have beenwonderfully lucky and am trying to find them in order to look afterthemYou need looking after yourself PresOh once away from Bonneville and the sight of the ruin there Imbetter
But intend to go away
And that makes me think came to askyou if you could help me
If you would let me take passage on one ofyour wheat ships
The Doctor says an ocean voyage would set me upWhy certainly Pres declared Cedarquist
But Im sorry youll haveto go
We expected to have you down in the country with us this winterPresley shook his head
No he answered
must go
Even if had allmy health could not bring myself to stay in California just now
Ifyou can introduce me to one of your captainsWith pleasure
When do you want to go
You may have to wait fewweeks
Our first ship wont clear till the end of the monthThat would do very well
Thank you sirBut Cedarquist was still interested in the land troubles of theBonneville farmers and took the first occasion to askSo the Railroad are in possession on most of the ranches On allof them returned Presley
The League went all to pieces so soon asMagnus was forced to resign
The old storythey got quarrelling amongthemselves
Somebody started compromise party and upon that issuea new president was elected
Then there were defections
The Railroadoffered to lease the lands in question to the ranchersthe rancherswho owned them he exclaimed bitterly and because the terms werenominalalmost nothingplenty of the men took the chance of savingthemselves
And of course once signing the lease they acknowledgedthe Railroads title
But the road would not lease to Magnus
Behrmantakes over Los Muertos in few weeks nowNo doubt the road made over their title in the property to him observed Cedarquist as reward of his servicesNo doubt murmured Presley wearily
He rose to go
By the way said Cedarquist what have you on hand for let us sayFriday evening
Wont you dine with us then
The girls are going to thecountry Monday of next week and you probably wont see them again forsome time if you take that ocean voyage of yoursIm afraid shall be very poor company sir hazarded Presley
Theres no go no life in me at all these days
am like clockwith broken springNot broken Pres my boy urged the other only run down
Try and seeif we cant wind you up bit
Say that we can expect you
We dine atsevenThank you sir
Till Friday at seven thenRegaining the street Presley sent his valise to his club where he hadengaged room by messenger boy and boarded Castro Street car
Before leaving Bonneville he had ascertained by strenuous enquiryMrs Hoovens address in the city and thitherward he now directed hissteps
When Presley had told Cedarquist that he was ill that he was jadedworn out he had only told half the truth
Exhausted he was nervelessweak but this apathy was still invaded from time to time with fierceincursions of spirit of unrest and revolt reactions momentaryreturns of the blind undirected energy that at one time had promptedhim to vast desire to acquit himself of some terrible deed ofreadjustment just what he could not say some terrifying martyrdomsome aweinspiring immolation consummate incisive conclusive
Hefancied himself to be fired with the purblind mistaken heroism of theanarchist hurling his victim to destruction with full knowledge thatthe catastrophe shall sweep him also into the vortex it creates
But his constitutional irresoluteness obstructed his path continuallybrainsick weak of will emotional timid even he temporisedprocrastinated brooded came to decisions in the dark hours of thenight only to abandon them in the morning
Once only he had ACTED
And at this moment as he was carried throughthe windy squalid streets he trembled at the remembrance of it
Thehorror of what might have been incompatible with the vengeancewhose minister he fancied he was oppressed him
The scene perpetuallyreconstructed itself in his imagination
He saw himself under the shadeof the encompassing trees and shrubbery creeping on his belly towardthe house in the suburbs of Bonneville watching his chances seizingopportunities spying upon the lighted windows where the raised curtainsafforded view of the interior
Then had come the appearance in theglare of the gas of the figure of the man for whom he waited
He sawhimself rise and run forward
He remembered the feel and weight in hishand of Carahers bombthe six inches of plugged gas pipe
His upraisedarm shot forward
There was shiver of smashed windowpanes thenavoida red whirl of confusion the air rent the ground rockinghimself flung headlong flung off the spinning circumference of thingsout into place of terror and vacancy and darkness
And then after along time the return of reason the consciousness that his feet were setupon the road to Los Muertos and that he was fleeing terrorstrickengasping all but insane with hysteria
Then the nevertobeforgottennight that ensued when he descended into the pit horrified at whathe supposed he had done at one moment ridden with remorse at anotherraging against his own feebleness his lack of courage his wretchedvacillating spirit
But morning had come and with it the knowledge thathe had failed and the baser assurance that he was not even remotelysuspected
His own escape had been no less miraculous than that of hisenemy and he had fallen on his knees in inarticulate prayer weepingpouring out his thanks to God for the deliverance from the gulf to thevery brink of which his feet had been drawn
After this however there had come to Presley deeprooted suspicionthat he wasof all human beings the most wretcheda failure
Everything to which he had set his mind failedhis great epic hisefforts to help the people who surrounded him even his attempteddestruction of the enemy all these had come to nothing
Girding hisshattered strength together he resolved upon one last attempt to liveup to the best that was in him and to that end had set himself to liftout of the despair into which they had been thrust the bereaved familyof the German Hooven
After all was over and Hooven together with the seven others who hadfallen at the irrigating ditch was buried in the Bonneville cemeteryMrs Hooven asking no ones aid or advice and taking with her Minnaand little Hilda had gone to San Franciscohad gone to find workabandoning Los Muertos and her home forever
Presley only learned of thedeparture of the family after fifteen days had elapsed
At once however the suspicion forced itself upon him that MrsHoovenand Minna too for the matter of thatcountrybred ignorant ofcity ways might easily come to grief in the hard huge struggle of citylife
This suspicion had swiftly hardened to conviction acting atlast upon which Presley had followed them to San Francisco bent uponfinding and assisting them
The house to which Presley was led by the address in his memorandum bookwas cheap but fairly decent hotel near the power house of the CastroStreet cable
He inquired for Mrs Hooven
The landlady recollected the Hoovens perfectly
German woman with little girlbaby and an older daughter sure
The older daughter was main pretty
Sure remember them but they ainthere no more
They left week ago
had to ask them for their room
As it was they owed weeks roomrent
Mister cant affordWell do you know where they went
Did you hear what address they hadtheir trunk expressed toAh yes their trunk vociferated the woman clapping her hands to herhips her face purpling
Their trunk ah sure
got their trunk andwhat are you going to do about it
Im holding it till get my money
What have you got to say about it
Lets hear itPresley turned away with gesture of discouragement his heart sinking
On the street corner he stood for long time frowning in trouble andperplexity
His suspicions had been only too well founded
So long agoas week the Hoovens had exhausted all their little store of money
For seven days now they had been without resources unless indeed workhad been found and what he asked himself what work in Gods namecould they find to do here in the citySeven days
He quailed at the thought of it
Seven days without moneyknowing not soul in all that swarming city
Ignorant of city life asboth Minna and her mother were would they even realise that there wereinstitutions built and generously endowed for just such as they
Heknew them to have their share of pride the dogged sullen pride of thepeasant even if they knew of charitable organisations would theycould they bring themselves to apply there
poignant anxiety thrustitself sharply into Presleys heart
Where were they now
Where had theyslept last night
Where breakfasted this morning
Had there even beenany breakfast this morning
Had there even been any bed last night
Lost and forgotten in the plexus of the citys life what had befallenthem
Towards what fate was the ebb tide of the streets drifting them
Was this to be still another theme wrought out by iron hands upon theold the worldold worldwide keynote
How far were the consequencesof that dreadful days work at the irrigating ditch to reach
To whatlength was the tentacle of the monster to extend
Presley returned toward the central the business quarter of the cityalternately formulating and dismissing from his mind plan after planfor the finding and aiding of Mrs Hooven and her daughters
He reachedMontgomery Street and turned toward his club his imagination once morereviewing all the causes and circumstances of the great battle of whichfor the last eighteen months he had been witness
All at once he paused his eye caught by sign affixed to the wall justinside the street entrance of huge office building and smitten withan idea stood for an instant motionless upon the sidewalk his eyeswide his fists shut tight
The building contained the General Office of the Pacific andSouthwestern Railroad
Large though it was it nevertheless was notpretentious and during his visits to the city Presley must have passedit unheeding many times
But for all that it was the stronghold of the enemythe centre of allthat vast ramifying system of arteries that drained the lifebloodof the State the nucleus of the web in which so many lives so manyfortunes so many destinies had been enmeshed
From this placeso hetold himselfhad emanated that policy of extortion oppression andinjustice that little by little had shouldered the ranchers from theirrights till their backs to the wall exasperated and despairing theyhad turned and fought and died
From here had come the orders to SBehrman to Cyrus Ruggles and to Genslinger the orders that had broughtDyke to prison that had killed Annixter that had ruined Magnus thathad corrupted Lyman
Here was the keep of the castle and here behindone of those many windows in one of those many offices his hand uponthe levers of his mighty engine sat the master Shelgrim himself
Instantly upon the realisation of this fact an ungovernable desireseized upon Presley an inordinate curiosity
Why not see face to facethe man whose power was so vast whose will was so resistless whosepotency for evil so limitless the man who for so long and sohopelessly they had all been fighting
By reputation he knew him tobe approachable why should he not then approach him
Presley took hisresolution in both hands
If he failed to act upon this impulse he knewhe would never act at all
His heart beating his breath coming shorthe entered the building and in few moments found himself seated in ananteroom his eyes fixed with hypnotic intensity upon the frosted paneof an adjoining door whereon in gold letters was inscribed the wordPRESIDENTIn the end Presley had been surprised to find that Shelgrim was stillin
It was already very late after six oclock and the other officesin the building were in the act of closing
Many of them were alreadydeserted
At every instant through the open door of the anteroomhe caught glimpse of clerks office boys bookkeepers and otheremployees hurrying towards the stairs and elevators quitting businessfor the day
Shelgrim it seemed still remained at his desk knowing nofatigue requiring no leisure
What time does Mr Shelgrim usually go home inquired Presley of theyoung man who sat ruling forms at the table in the anteroom
Anywhere between halfpast six and seven the other answered addingVery often he comes back in the eveningAnd the man was seventy years old
Presley could not repress murmur ofastonishment
Not only mentally then was the President of the andS giant
Seventy years of age and still at his post holding therewith the energy with concentration of purpose that would have wreckedthe health and impaired the mind of many men in the prime of theirmanhood
But the next instant Presley set his teeth
It is an ogres vitality he said to himself
Just so is themaneating tiger strong
The man should have energy who has sucked thelifeblood from an entire PeopleA little electric bell on the wall near at hand trilled warning
Theyoung man who was ruling forms laid down his pen and opening thedoor of the Presidents office thrust in his head then after wordexchanged with the unseen occupant of the room he swung the door widesaying to PresleyMr
Shelgrim will see you sirPresley entered large well lighted but singularly barren office
Awellworn carpet was on the floor two steel engravings hung against thewall an extra chair or two stood near large plain littered table
That was absolutely all unless he excepted the corner washstandon which was set pitcher of ice water covered with clean stiffnapkin
man evidently some sort of managers assistant stood at theend of the table leaning on the back of one of the chairs
Shelgrimhimself sat at the table
He was large almost to massiveness
An irongrey beard and mustachethat completely hid the mouth covered the lower part of his face
Hiseyes were pale blue and little watery here and there upon his facewere moth spots
But the enormous breadth of the shoulders was what atfirst most vividly forced itself upon Presleys notice
Never hadhe seen broader man the neck however seemed in manner to havesettled into the shoulders and furthermore they were humped androunded as if to bear great responsibilities and great abuse
At the moment he was wearing silk skullcap pushed to one side anda little awry frock coat of broadcloth with long sleeves and awaistcoat from the lower buttons of which the cloth was worn and uponthe edges rubbed away showing the metal underneath
At the top thiswaistcoat was unbuttoned and in the shirt front disclosed were two pearlstuds
Presley uninvited unnoticed apparently sat down
The assistantmanager was in the act of making report
His voice was not loweredand Presley heard every word that was spoken
The report proved interesting
It concerned bookkeeper in theoffice of the auditor of disbursements
It seems he was at most timesthoroughly reliable hardworking industrious ambitious
But at longintervals the vice of drunkenness seized upon the man and for three daysrode him like hag
Not only during the period of this intemperancebut for the few days immediately following the man was useless hiswork untrustworthy
He was family man and earnestly strove to ridhimself of his habit he was when sober valuable
In consideration ofthese facts he had been pardoned again and again
You remember Mr Shelgrim observed the manager that you have morethan once interfered in his behalf when we were disposed to let him go
dont think we can do anything with him sir
He promises to reformcontinually but it is the same old story
This last time we saw nothingof him for four days
Honestly Mr Shelgrim think we ought to letTentell out
We cant afford to keep him
He is really losing us toomuch money
Heres the order ready now if you care to let it goThere was pause
Presley all attention listened breathlessly
Theassistant manager laid before his President the typewritten order inquestion
The silence lengthened in the hall outside the wroughtirondoor of the elevator cage slid to with clash
Shelgrim did not look atthe order
He turned his swivel chair about and faced the windows behindhim looking out with unseeing eyes
At last he spokeTentell has family wife and three children
How much do we pay himOne hundred and thirtyLets double that or say two hundred and fifty
Lets see how thatwill doWhyof courseif you say so but really Mr ShelgrimWell well try that anyhowPresley had not time to readjust his perspective to this new point ofview of the President of the and before the assistant managerhad withdrawn
Shelgrim wrote few memoranda on his calendar pad andsigned couple of letters before turning his attention to Presley
Atlast he looked up and fixed the young man with direct grave glance
He did not smile
It was some time before he spoke
At last he saidWell sirPresley advanced and took chair nearer at hand
Shelgrim turned andfrom his desk picked up and consulted Presleys card
Presley observedthat he read without the use of glasses
You he said again facing about you are the young man who wrote thepoem called The Toilers
Yes sirIt seems to have made great deal of talk
Ive read it and Ive seenthe picture in Cedarquists house the picture you took the idea fromPresley his senses never more alive observed that curiously enoughShelgrim did not move his body
His arms moved and his head butthe great bulk of the man remained immobile in its place and as theinterview proceeded and this peculiarity emphasised itself Presleybegan to conceive the odd idea that Shelgrim had as it were placed hisbody in the chair to rest while his head and brain and hands wenton working independently
saucer of shelled filberts stood near hiselbow and from time to time he picked up one of these in great thumband forefinger and put it between his teeth
Ive seen the picture called The Toilers continued Shelgrim andof the two like the picture better than the poemThe picture is by master Presley hastened to interpose
And for that reason said Shelgrim it leaves nothing more to besaid
You might just as well have kept quiet
Theres only one best wayto say anything
And what has made the picture of The Toilers great isthat the artist said in it the BEST that could be said on the subjectI had never looked at it in just that light observed Presley
Hewas confused all at sea embarrassed
What he had expected to find inShelgrim he could not have exactly said
But he had been preparedto come upon an ogre brute terrible man of blood and iron andinstead had discovered sentimentalist and an art critic
No standardsof measurement in his mental equipment would apply to the actual manand it began to dawn upon him that possibly it was not because thesestandards were different in kind but that they were lamentablydeficient in size
He began to see that here was the man not only greatbut large manysided of vast sympathies who understood with equalintelligence the human nature in an habitual drunkard the ethics ofa masterpiece of painting and the financiering and operation of tenthousand miles of railroad
had never looked at it in just that light repeated Presley
Thereis great deal in what you sayIf am to listen continued Shelgrim to that kind of talk preferto listen to it first hand
would rather listen to what the greatFrench painter has to say than to what YOU have to say about what hehas already saidHis speech loud and emphatic at first when the idea of what he had tosay was fresh in his mind lapsed and lowered itself at the end of hissentences as though he had already abandoned and lost interest in thatthought so that the concluding words were indistinct beneath the greybeard and mustache
Also at times there was the faintest suggestion of alisp
wrote that poem hazarded Presley at time when was terriblyupset
live he concluded or did live on the Los Muertos ranch inTulare CountyMagnus Derricks ranchThe Railroads ranch LEASED to Mr Derrick observed Shelgrim
Presley spread out his hands with helpless resigned gesture
And continued the President of the and with grave intensitylooking at Presley keenly suppose you believe am grand oldrascalI believe answered Presley am persuaded He hesitatedsearching for his words
Believe this young man exclaimed Shelgrim laying thick powerfulforefinger on the table to emphasise his words try to believe thistobegin withTHAT RAILROADS BUILD THEMSELVES
Where there is demandsooner or later there will be supply
Mr Derrick does he grow hiswheat
The Wheat grows itself
What does he count for
Does he supplythe force
What do count for
Do build the Railroad
You are dealingwith forces young man when you speak of Wheat and the Railroads notwith men
There is the Wheat the supply
It must be carried to feedthe People
There is the demand
The Wheat is one force the Railroadanother and there is the law that governs themsupply and demand
Menhave only little to do in the whole business
Complications may ariseconditions that bear hard on the individualcrush him maybeBUT THEWHEAT WILL BE CARRIED TO FEED THE PEOPLE as inevitably as it will grow
If you want to fasten the blame of the affair at Los Muertos on any oneperson you will make mistake
Blame conditions not menButbut faltered Presley you are the head you control the roadYou are very young man
Control the road
Can stop it
cango into bankruptcy if you like
But otherwise if run my road as abusiness proposition can do nothing
can not control it
It isa force born out of certain conditions and Ino mancan stop it orcontrol it
Can your Mr Derrick stop the Wheat growing
He can burn hiscrop or he can give it away or sell it for cent busheljust as Icould go into bankruptcybut otherwise his Wheat must grow
Can any onestop the Wheat
Well then no more can stop the RoadPresley regained the street stupefied his brain in whirl
This newidea this new conception dumfounded him
Somehow he could not denyit
It rang with the clear reverberation of truth
Was no one then toblame for the horror at the irrigating ditch
Forces conditionslaws of supply and demandwere these then the enemies after all
Notenemies there was no malevolence in Nature
Colossal indifferenceonly vast trend toward appointed goals
Nature was then giganticengine vast cyclopean power huge terrible leviathan with heartof steel knowing no compunction no forgiveness no tolerance crushingout the human atom standing in its way with nirvanic calm the agony ofdestruction sending never jar never the faintest tremour through allthat prodigious mechanism of wheels and cogs
He went to his club andate his supper alone in gloomy agitation
He was sombre brooding lostin dark maze of gloomy reflections
However just as he was risingfrom the table an incident occurred that for the moment roused him andsharply diverted his mind
His table had been placed near window and as he was sipping hisafterdinner coffee he happened to glance across the street
His eyewas at once caught by the sight of familiar figure
Was it MinnaHooven
The figure turned the street corner and was lost to sight butit had been strangely like
On the moment Presley had risen from thetable and clapping on his hat had hurried into the streets where thelamps were already beginning to shine
But search though he would Presley could not again come upon the youngwoman in whom he fancied he had seen the daughter of the unfortunateGerman
At last he gave up the hunt and returning to his clubat thishour almost desertedsmoked few cigarettes vainly attempted toread from volume of essays in the library and at last nervousdistraught exhausted retired to his bed
But none the less Presley had not been mistaken
The girl whom he hadtried to follow had been indeed Minna Hooven
When Minna week before this time had returned to the lodging houseon Castro Street after days unsuccessful effort to find employmentand was told that her mother and Hilda had gone she was struckspeechless with surprise and dismay
She had never before been in anytown larger than Bonneville and now knew not which way to turn nor howto account for the disappearance of her mother and little Hilda
Thatthe landlady was on the point of turning them out she understood butit had been agreed that the family should be allowed to stay yet onemore day in the hope that Minna would find work
Of this she remindedthe landlady
But this latter at once launched upon her such torrentof vituperation that the girl was frightened to speechless submission
Oh oh she faltered know
am sorry
know we owe you moneybut where did my mother go
only want to find herOh aint going to be bothered shrilled the other
How do knowThe truth of the matter was that Mrs Hooven afraid to stay in thevicinity of the house after her eviction and threatened with arrest bythe landlady if she persisted in hanging around had left with thewoman note scrawled on an old blotter to be given to Minna whenshe returned
This the landlady had lost
To cover her confusion sheaffected vast indignation and turbulent irascible demeanour
aint going to be bothered with such cattle as you she vociferatedin Minnas face
dont know where your folks is
Me only havedealings with honest people
aint got word to say so long as therent is paid
But when Im soldiered out of weeks lodging then Imdone
You get right along now
dont know you
aint going to havemy place get bad name by having any South of Market Street chippieshanging around
You get along or Ill call an officerMinna sought the street her head in whirl
It was about five oclock
In her pocket was thirtyfive cents all she had in the world
What now
All at once the Terror of the City that blind unreasoned fear thatonly the outcast knows swooped upon her and clutched her vulturewiseby the throat
Her first few days experience in the matter of finding employment hadtaught her just what she might expect from this new world upon which shehad been thrown
What was to become of her
What was she to do wherewas she to go
Unanswerable grim questions and now she no longer hadherself to fear for
Her mother and the baby little Hilda both of themequally unable to look after themselves what was to become of themwhere were they gone
Lost lost all of them herself as well
But sherallied herself as she walked along
The idea of her starving of hermother and Hilda starving was out of all reason
Of course it wouldnot come to that of course not
It was not thus that starvation came
Something would happen of course it wouldin time
But meanwhilemeanwhile how to get through this approaching night and the next fewdays
That was the thing to think of just now
The suddenness of it all was what most unnerved her
During all thenineteen years of her life she had never known what it meant to shiftfor herself
Her father had always sufficed for the family he had takencare of her then all of sudden her father had been killed hermother snatched from her
Then all of sudden there was no helpanywhere
Then all of sudden terrible voice demanded of her Nowjust what can you do to keep yourself alive Life faced her she lookedthe huge stone image squarely in the lustreless eyes
It was nearly twilight
Minna for the sake of avoiding observationforit seemed to her that now thousand prying glances followedherassumed matteroffact demeanour and began to walk brisklytoward the business quarter of the town
She was dressed neatly enough in blue cloth skirt with blue plushbelt fairly decent shoes once her mothers pink shirt waist andjacket and straw sailor
She was in an unusual fashion pretty
Evenher troubles had not dimmed the bright light of her pale greenishblueeyes nor faded the astonishing redness of her lips nor hollowed herstrangely white face
Her blueblack hair was trim
She carried herwellshaped wellrounded figure erectly
Even in her distress sheobserved that men looked keenly at her and sometimes after her as shewent along
But this she noted with dim subconscious faculty
Thereal Minna harassed terrified lashed with thousand anxieties keptmurmuring under her breathWhat shall do what shall do oh what shall do nowAfter an interminable walk she gained Kearney Street and held it tillthe welllighted wellkept neighbourhood of the shopping districtgave place to the vicecrowded saloons and concert halls of the BarbaryCoast
She turned aside in avoidance of this only to plunge into thepurlieus of Chinatown whence only she emerged panicstricken and outof breath after half hour of nevertobeforgotten terrors and at atime when it had grown quite dark
On the corner of California and Dupont streets she stood long momentpondering
MUST do something she said to herself
must do SOMETHING Shewas tired out by now and the idea occurred to her to enter the Catholicchurch in whose shadow she stood and sit down and rest
This she did
The evening service was just being concluded
But long after the priestsand altar boys had departed from the chancel Minna still sat in thedim echoing interior confronting her desperate situation as best shemight
Two or three hours later the sexton woke her
The church was beingclosed she must leave
Once more chilled with the sharp night airnumb with long sitting in the same attitude still oppressed withdrowsiness confused frightened Minna found herself on the pavement
She began to be hungry and at length yielding to the demand thatevery moment grew more imperious bought and eagerly devoured afivecent bag of fruit
Then once more she took up the round ofwalking
At length in an obscure street that branched from Kearney Street nearthe corner of the Plaza she came upon an illuminated sign bearing theinscription Beds for the Night and centsFifteen cents
Could she afford it
It would leave her with only thatmuch more that much between herself and state of privation of whichshe dared not think and besides the forbidding look of the buildingfrightened her
It was dark gloomy dirty place suggestive ofobscure crimes and hidden terrors
For twenty minutes or half an hourshe hesitated walking twice and three times around the block
At lastshe made up her mind
Exhaustion such as she had never known weighedlike lead upon her shoulders and dragged at her heels
She must sleep
She could not walk the streets all night
She entered the doorway underthe sign and found her way up filthy flight of stairs
At the top aman in blue checked jumper was filling lamp behind high desk
Tohim Minna applied
should like she faltered to have rooma bed for the night
Oneof those for fifteen cents will be good enough thinkWell this place is only for men said the man looking up from thelamp
Oh said Minna ohII didnt knowShe looked at him stupidly and he with equal stupidity returned thegaze
Thus for long moment they held each others eyes
II didnt know repeated Minna
Yes its for men repeated the other
She slowly descended thestairs and once more came out upon the streets
And upon those streets that as the hours advanced grew more and moredeserted more and more silent more and more oppressive with thesense of the bitter hardness of life towards those who have no means ofliving Minna Hooven spent the first night of her struggle to keepher head above the ebbtide of the citys sea into which she had beenplunged
Morning came and with it renewed hunger
At this time she had foundher way uptown again and towards ten oclock was sitting upon benchin little park full of nursemaids and children
group of the maidsdrew their babybuggies to Minnas bench and sat down continuing aconversation they had already begun
Minna listened
friend of one ofthe maids had suddenly thrown up her position leaving her madame inwhat would appear to have been deserved embarrassment
Oh said Minna breaking in and lying with sudden unwonted fluencyI am nursegirl
am out of place
Do you think could get thatoneThe group turned and fixed herso evidently country girlwith asupercilious indifference
Well you might try said one of them
Got good referencesReferences repeated Minna blankly
She did not know what this meant
Oh Mrs Field aint the kind to stick about references spoke up theother shes that soft
Why anybody could work herIll go there said Minna
Have you the address It was told to her
Lorin she murmured
Is that out of townWell its across the BayAcross the BayUm
Youre from the country aint youYes
Howhow do get there
Is it farWell you take the ferry at the foot of Market Street and then thetrain on the other side
No it aint very far
Just ask any one downthere
Theyll tell youIt was chance but Minna after walking down to the ferry slips foundthat the round trip would cost her twenty cents
If the journeyproved fruitless only dime would stand between her and the endof everything
But it was chance the only one that had as yetpresented itself
She made the trip
And upon the streetrailway cars upon the ferryboats on thelocomotives and waycoaches of the local trains she was reminded ofher fathers death and of the giant power that had reduced her to herpresent straits by the letters and To her mind theyoccurred everywhere
She seemed to see them in every direction
Shefancied herself surrounded upon every hand by the long arms of themonster
Minute after minute her hunger gnawed at her
She could not keepher mind from it
As she sat on the boat she found herself curiouslyscanning the faces of the passengers wondering how long since sucha one had breakfasted how long before this other should sit down tolunch
When Minna descended from the train at Lorin on the other side of theBay she found that the place was one of those suburban towns not yetbecome fashionable such as may be seen beyond the outskirts of anylarge American city
All along the line of the railroad thereaboutshouses small villascontractors ventureswere scattered theadvantages of suburban lots and sites for homes being proclaimed insevenfoot letters upon mammoth billboards close to the right ofway
Without much trouble Minna found the house to which she had beendirected pretty little cottage set back from the street and shadedby palms live oaks and the inevitable eucalyptus
Her heart warmed atthe sight of it
Oh to find little niche for herself here homea refuge from those horrible city streets from the rat of famine withits relentless tooth
How she would work how strenuously she wouldendeavour to please how patient of rebuke she would be how faithfulhow conscientious
Nor were her pretensions altogether false upon herwhile at home had devolved almost continually the care of the babyHilda her little sister
She knew the wants and needs of children
Her heart beating her breath failing she rang the bell set squarely inthe middle of the front door
The lady of the house herself an elderly lady with pleasant kindlyface opened the door
Minna stated her errand
But have already engaged girl she said
Oh murmured Minna striving with all her might to maintainappearances
OhI thought perhaps She turned away
Im sorry said the lady
Then she added Would you care to lookafter so many as three little children and help around in lighthousework between whilesYes maam Because my sistershe lives in North Berkeley abovehereshes looking far girl
Have you had lots of experience
Gotgood referencesYes maamWell Ill give you the address
She lives up in North BerkeleyShe turned back into the house moment and returned handing Minna acard
Thats where she livescareful not to BLOT it child the inks wetyetyou had better see herIs it far
Could walk thereMy no you better take the electric cars about six blocks abovehereWhen Minna arrived in North Berkeley she had no money left
By cruelmistake she had taken car going in the wrong direction and thoughher error was rectified easily enough it had cost her her lastfivecent piece
She was now to try her last hope
Promptly it crumbledaway
Like the former this place had been already filled and Minnaleft the door of the house with the certainty that her chance hadcome to naught and that now she entered into the last struggle withlifethe death struggleshorn of her last pitiful defence her lastsafeguard her last penny
As she once more resumed her interminable walk she realised shewas weak faint and she knew that it was the weakness of completeexhaustion and the faintness of approaching starvation
Was this theend coming on
Terror of death aroused her
MUST MUST do something oh anything
must have something toeatAt this late hour the idea of pawning her little jacket occurred toher but now she was far away from the city and its pawnshops and therewas no getting back
She walked on
An hour passed
She lost her sense of direction becameconfused knew not where she was going turned corners and went upbystreets without knowing why anything to keep moving for she fanciedthat so soon as she stood still the rat in the pit of her stomachgnawed more eagerly
At last she entered what seemed to be if not park at leastsome sort of public enclosure
There were many trees the place wasbeautiful wellkept roads and walks led sinuously and invitinglyunderneath the shade
Through the trees upon the other side of wideexpanse of turf brown and sear under the summer sun she caught aglimpse of tall buildings and flagstaff
The whole place had vaguelypublic educational appearance and Minna guessed from certain noticesaffixed to the trees warning the public against the picking of flowersthat she had found her way into the grounds of the State University
Shewent on little further
The path she was following led her at lengthinto grove of gigantic live oaks whose lower branches all but sweptthe ground
Here the grass was green the few flowers in bloom theshade very thick
more lovely spot she had seldom seen
Near at handwas bench built around the trunk of the largest live oak and hereat length weak from hunger exhausted to the limits of her endurancedespairing abandoned Minna Hooven sat down to enquire of herself whatnext she could do
But once seated the demands of the animalso she could believebecamemore clamorous more insistent
To eat to rest to be safely housedagainst another night above all else these were the things she cravedand the craving within her grew so mighty that she crisped her poorstarved hands into little fists in an agony of desire while the tearsran from her eyes and the sobs rose thick from her breast and struggledand strangled in her aching throat
But in few moments Minna was aware that woman apparently of somethirty years of age had twice passed along the walk in front of thebench where she sat and now as she took more notice of her sheremembered that she had seen her on the ferryboat coming over from thecity
The woman was gowned in silk tightly corseted and wore hat of ratherostentatious smartness
Minna became convinced that the person waswatching her but before she had chance to act upon this convictionshe was surprised out of all countenance by the stranger coming up towhere she sat and speaking to her
Here is coincidence exclaimed the newcomer as she sat downsurely you are the young girl who sat opposite me on the boat
StrangeI should come across you again
Ive had you in mind ever sinceOn this nearer view Minna observed that the womans face borerather more than trace of enamel and that the atmosphere about wasimpregnated with sachet
She was not otherwise conspicuous but therewas certain hardness about her mouth and certain droop of fatiguein her eyelids which combined with an indefinite selfconfidence ofmanner held Minnas attention
Do you know continued the woman believe you are in trouble
Ithought so when saw you on the boat and think so now
Are you
Areyou in trouble
Youre from the country aint youMinna glad to find sympathiser even in this chance acquaintanceadmitted that she was in distress that she had become separated fromher mother and that she was indeed from the country
Ive been trying to find situation she hazarded in conclusionbut dont seem to succeed
Ive never been in city before exceptBonnevilleWell it IS coincidence said the other
know wasnt drawn toyou for nothing
am looking for just such young girl as you
Yousee live alone good deal and Ive been wanting to find nicebright sociable girl who will be sort of COMPANION to me
And theres something about you that like
took to you the moment Isaw you on the boat
Now shall we talk this overTowards the end of the week one afternoon as Presley was returningfrom his club he came suddenly face to face with Minna upon streetcorner
Ah he cried coming toward her joyfully
Upon my word had almostgiven you up
Ive been looking everywhere for you
was afraid youmight not be getting along and wanted to see if there was anythingI could do
How are your mother and Hilda
Where are you stopping
Haveyou got good placeI dont know where mamma is answered Minna
We got separated and Inever have been able to find her againMeanwhile Presley had been taking in with quick eye the details ofMinnas silk dress with its garniture of lace its edging of velvetits silver beltbuckle
Her hair was arranged in new way and on herhead was wide hat with flare to one side set off with gilt buckleand puff of bright blue plush
He glanced at her sharply
Well butbut how are you getting on he demanded
Minna laughed scornfully
she cried
Oh IVE gone to hell
It was either that orstarvationPresley regained his room at the club white and trembling
Worse thanthe worst he had feared had happened
He had not been soon enough tohelp
He had failed again
superstitious fear assailed him that hewas in manner marked that he was foredoomed to fail
Minna hadcomehad been driven to this and he acting too late upon his tardyresolve had not been able to prevent it
Were the horrors then neverto end
Was the grisly spectre of consequence to forever dance in hisvision
Were the results the farreaching results of that battle atthe irrigating ditch to cross his path forever
When would the affairbe terminated the incident closed
Where was that spot to which thetentacle of the monster could not reach
By now he was sick with the dread of it all
He wanted to get away tobe free from that endless misery so that he might not see what hecould no longer help
Cowardly he now knew himself to be
He thought ofhimself only with loathing
Bitterly selfcontemptuous that he could bring himself to aparticipation in such trivialities he began to dress to keep hisengagement to dine with the Cedarquists
He arrived at the house nearly half an hour late but before he couldtake off his overcoat Mrs Cedarquist appeared in the doorway of thedrawingroom at the end of the hall
She was dressed as if to go out
My DEAR Presley she exclaimed her stout overdressed body bustlingtoward him with great rustle of silk
never was so glad
You poordear poet you are thin as ghost
You need better dinner than cangive you and that is just what you are to haveHave blundered Presley hastened to exclaim
Did not Mr Cedarquistmention Friday eveningNo no no she cried it was he who blundered
YOU blundering ina social amenity
No Mr Cedarquist forgot that we weredining out ourselves tonight and when he told me he had asked youhere for the same evening fell upon the man my dear did actuallytooth and nail
But wouldnt hear of his wiring you
just droppeda note to our hostess asking if could not bring you and when toldher who you WERE she received the idea with oh empressement
Sothere it is all settled
Cedarquist and the girls are gone on aheadand you are to take the old lady like dear dear poet
believe Ihear the carriage
En voitureOnce settled in the cool gloom of the coupe odorous of leather andupholstery Mrs Cedarquist exclaimedAnd Ive never told you who you were to dine with oh personagereally
Fancy you will be in the camp of your dearest foes
You areto dine with the Gerard people one of the VicePresidents of your betenoir the and RailroadPresley started his fists clenching so abruptly as to all but split hiswhite gloves
He was not conscious of what he said in reply and MrsCedarquist was so taken up with her own endless stream of talk that shedid not observe his confusion
Their daughter Honora is going to Europe next week her mother is totake her and Mrs Gerard is to have just few people to dinnerveryinformal you knowourselves you and oh dont know two or threeothers
Have you ever seen Honora
The prettiest little thing andwill she be rich
Millions would not dare say how many
NousvoiciThe coupe drew up to the curb and Presley followed Mrs Cedarquist upthe steps to the massive doors of the great house
In confused dazehe allowed one of the footmen to relieve him of his hat and coat in adaze he rejoined Mrs Cedarquist in room with glass roof hung withpictures the art gallery no doubt and in daze heard their namesannounced at the entrance of another room the doors of which were hungwith thick blue curtains
He entered collecting his wits for the introductions and presentationsthat he foresaw impended
The room was very large and of excessive loftiness
Flat rectagonalpillars of rosetinted variegated marble rose from the floor almostflush with the walls finishing off at the top with gilded capitals ofa Corinthian design which supported the ceiling
The ceiling itselfinstead of joining the walls at right angles curved to meet them adevice that produced sort of domelike effect
This ceiling was mazeof golden involutions in very high relief that adjusted themselves toform massive framing for great picture nymphs and goddesses whitedoves golden chariots and the like all wreathed about with clouds andgarlands of roses
Between the pillars around the sides of the roomwere hangings of silk the designof Louis Quinze typeof beautifulsimplicity and faultless taste
The fireplace was marvel
It reachedfrom floor to ceiling the lower parts black marble carved intocrouching Atlases with great muscles that upbore the superstructure
The design of this latter of kind of purple marble shot throughwith white veinings was in the same style as the design of thesilk hangings
In its midst was bronze escutcheon bearing anundecipherable monogram and Latin motto
Andirons of brass nearly sixfeet high flanked the hearthstone
The windows of the room were heavily draped in sombre brocade and ecrulace in which the initials of the family were very beautifully worked
But directly opposite the fireplace an extra window lighted fromthe adjoining conservatory threw wonderful rich light into theapartment
It was Gothic window of stained glass very large thecentre figures being armed warriors Parsifal and Lohengrin the onewith banner the other with swan
The effect was exquisite thewindow veritable masterpiece glowing flaming and burning with ahundred tints and coloursopalescent purple winered clouded pinksroyal blues saffrons violets so dark as to be almost black
Under foot the carpet had all the softness of texture of grass skinsone of them of an enormous polar bear and rugs of silk velvet werespread upon the floor
Renaissance cabinet of ebony many feet tallerthan Presleys head and inlaid with ivory and silver occupied onecorner of the room while in its centre stood vast table of Flemishoak black heavy as iron massive
faint odour of sandalwoodpervaded the air
From the conservatory nearby came the splashing ofa fountain
row of electric bulbs let into the frieze of the wallsbetween the golden capitals and burning dimly behind hemispheres ofclouded glass threw subdued light over the whole scene
Mrs Gerard came forward
This is Mr Presley of course our new poet of whom we are all soproud
was so afraid you would be unable to come
You have given me areal pleasure in allowing me to welcome you hereThe footman appeared at her elbow
Dinner is served madame he announced
When Mrs Hooven had left the boardinghouse on Castro Street shehad taken up position on neighbouring corner to wait for Minnasreappearance
Little Hilda at this time hardly more than six years ofage was with her holding to her hand
Mrs Hooven was by no means an old woman but hard work had aged her
She no longer had any claim to good looks
She no longer took muchinterest in her personal appearance
At the time of her evictionfrom the Castro Street boardinghouse she wore faded black bonnetgarnished with faded artificial flowers of dirty pink
plaid shawlwas about her shoulders
But this day of misfortune had set Mrs Hoovenadrift in even worse condition than her daughter
Her purse containinga miserable handful of dimes and nickels was in her trunk and hertrunk was in the hands of the landlady
Minna had been allowed suchreprieve as her thirtyfive cents would purchase
The destitution ofMrs Hooven and her little girl had begun from the very moment of hereviction
While she waited for Minna watching every street car and everyapproaching pedestrian policeman appeared asked what she did andreceiving no satisfactory reply promptly moved her on
Minna had had little assurance in facing the life struggle of the city
Mrs Hooven had absolutely none
In her grief distress the pinch ofpoverty and above all the nameless fear of the turbulent fierce lifeof the streets had produced numbness an embruted sodden silentspeechless condition of dazed mind and clogged unintelligent speech
She was dumb bewildered stupid animated but by single impulse
Sheclung to life and to the life of her little daughter Hilda with theblind tenacity of purpose of drowning cat
Thus when ordered to move on by the officer she had silently obeyednot even attempting to explain her situation
She walked away to thenext streetcrossing
Then in few moments returned taking up herplace on the corner near the boardinghouse spying upon the approachingcable cars peeping anxiously down the length of the sidewalks
Once more the officer ordered her away and once more unprotestingshe complied
But when for the third time the policeman found her onthe forbidden spot he had lost his temper
This time when Mrs Hoovendeparted he had followed her and when bewildered persistent she hadattempted to turn back he caught her by the shoulder
Do you want to get arrested hey he demanded
Do you want me to lockyou up
Say do you speak upThe ominous words at length reached Mrs Hoovens comprehension
She was to be arrested
The countrywomans fear of the Jailnipped and bit eagerly at her unwilling heels
She hurried off thinkingto return to her post after the policeman should have gone away
Butwhen at length turning back she tried to find the boardinghouse shesuddenly discovered that she was on an unfamiliar street
Unwittinglyno doubt she had turned corner
She could not retrace her steps
Sheand Hilda were lost
Mammy Im tired Hilda complained
Her mother picked her up
Mammy wherere we gowun mammyWhere indeed
Stupefied Mrs Hooven looked about her at the endlessblocks of buildings the endless procession of vehicles in the streetsthe endless march of pedestrians on the sidewalks
Where was Minnawhere was she and her baby to sleep that night
How was Hilda to be fed
She could not stand still
There was no place to sit down but one thingwas left walk
Ah that via dolorosa of the destitute that chemin de la croix of thehomeless
Ah the mile after mile of granite pavement that MUST be MUSTbe traversed
Walk they must
Move they must onward forward whitherthey cannot tell why they do not know
Walk walk walk with bleedingfeet and smarting joints walk with aching back and trembling kneeswalk though the senses grow giddy with fatigue though the eyes droopwith sleep though every nerve demanding rest sets in motion its tinyalarm of pain
Death is at the end of that devious winding maze ofpaths crossed and recrossed and crossed again
There is but one goalto the via dolorosa there is no escape from the central chamber of thatlabyrinth
Fate guides the feet of them that are set therein
Double ontheir steps though they may weave in and out of the myriad corners ofthe citys streets return go forward back from side to side herethere anywhere dodge twist wind the central chamber where Deathsits is reached inexorably at the end
Sometimes leading and sometimes carrying Hilda Mrs Hooven set offupon her objectless journey
Block after block she walked street afterstreet
She was afraid to stop because of the policemen
As often asshe so much as slackened her pace she was sure to see one of theseterrible figures in the distance watching her so it seemed to herwaiting for her to halt for the fraction of second in order that hemight have an excuse to arrest her
Hilda fretted incessantly
Mammy wherere we gowun
Mammy Im tired Then at last for thefirst time that plaint that stabbed the mothers heartMammy Im hungryBe quiut den said Mrs Hooven
Bretty soon well hev der subberPassersby on the sidewalk men and women in the great six oclockhomeward march jostled them as they went along
With dumb dullcuriousness she looked into one after another of the limitless streamof faces and she fancied she saw in them every emotion but pity
Thefaces were gay were anxious were sorrowful were mirthful were linedwith thought or were merely flat and expressionless but not one wasturned toward her in compassion
The expressions of the faces might bevarious but an underlying callousness was discoverable beneath everymask
The people seemed removed from her immeasurably they wereinfinitely above her
What was she to them she and her baby thecrippled outcasts of the human herd the unfit not able to survivethrust out on the heath to perish
To beg from these people did not yet occur to her
There was no pridehowever in the matter
She would have as readily asked alms of so manysphinxes
She went on
Without willing it her feet carried her in wide circle
Soon she began to recognise the houses she had been in that streetbefore
Somehow this was distasteful to her so striking off at rightangles she walked straight before her for over dozen blocks
By nowit was growing darker
The sun had set
The hands of clock on thepowerhouse of cable line pointed to seven
No doubt Minna had comelong before this time had found her mother gone and hadjust what hadshe done just what COULD she do
Where was her daughter now
Walkingthe streets herself no doubt
What was to become of Minna prettygirl that she was lost houseless and friendless in the maze of thesestreets
Mrs Hooven roused from her lethargy could not repress anexclamation of anguish
Here was misfortune indeed here was calamity
She bestirred herself and remembered the address of the boardinghouse
She might inquire her way back thither
No doubt by now the policemanwould be gone home for the night
She looked about
She was in thedistrict of modest residences and young man was coming toward hercarrying new garden hose looped around his shoulder
Say Meestr say bleaseThe young man gave her quick look and passed on hitching the coilof hose over his shoulder
But few paces distant he slackened in hiswalk and fumbled in his vest pocket with his fingers
Then he came backto Mrs Hooven and put quarter into her hand
Mrs Hooven stared at the coin stupefied
The young man disappeared
He thought then that she was begging
It had come to that sheindependent all her life whose husband had held five hundred acres ofwheat land had been taken for beggar
flush of shame shot to herface
She was about to throw the money after its giver
But at themoment Hilda again exclaimedMammy Im hungryWith movement of infinite lassitude and resigned acceptance of thesituation Mrs Hooven put the coin in her pocket
She had no right tobe proud any longer
Hilda must have food
That evening she and her child had supper at cheap restaurant ina poor quarter of the town and passed the night on the benches of alittle uptown park
Unused to the ways of the town ignorant as to the customs andpossibilities of eatinghouses she spent the whole of her quarter uponsupper for herself and Hilda and had nothing left wherewith to buy alodging
The night was dreadful Hilda sobbed herself to sleep on her mothersshoulder waking thereafter from hour to hour to protest thoughwrapped in her mothers shawl that she was cold and to enquire whythey did not go to bed
Drunken men snored and sprawled near at hand
Towards morning loafer reeking of alcohol sat down beside herand indulged in an incoherent soliloquy punctuated with oaths andobscenities
It was not till far along towards daylight that she fellasleep
She awoke to find it broad day
Her motherslimbs were stiff and lame with cold and damp her head throbbed
Shemoved to another bench which stood in the rays of the sun and for along two hours sat there in the thin warmth till the moisture of thenight that clung to her clothes was evaporated
policeman came into view
She woke Hilda and carrying her in herarms took herself away
Mammy began Hilda as soon as she was well awake Mammy Im hungry
want mein breakfestSure sure soon now leedle tochterShe herself was hungry but she had but little thought of that
How wasHilda to be fed
She remembered her experience of the previous day whenthe young man with the hose had given her money
Was it so easy thento beg
Could charity be had for the asking
So it seemed but all thatwas left of her sturdy independence revolted at the thought
SHE beg
SHE hold out the hand to strangers
Mammy Im hungryThere was no other way
It must come to that in the end
Why temporisewhy put off the inevitable
She sought out frequented street where menand women were on their way to work
One after another she let themgo by searching their faces deterred at the very last moment by sometrifling variation of expression firm set mouth serious leveleyebrow an advancing chin
Then twice when she had made choice andbrought her resolution to the point of speech she quailed shrinkingher ears tingling her whole being protesting against the degradation
Every one must be looking at her
Her shame was no doubt the object ofan hundred eyes
Mammy Im hungry protested Hilda again
She made up her mind
What though was she to say
In what words didbeggars ask for assistance
She tried to remember how tramps who had appeared at her back dooron Los Muertos had addressed her how and with what formula certainmendicants of Bonneville had appealed to her
Then having settled upona phrase she approached whiskered gentleman with large stomachwalking briskly in the direction of the town
Say den blease hellup boor womunThe gentleman passed on
Perhaps he doand hear me she murmured
Two welldressed women advanced chattering gayly
Say say den blease hellup boor womunOne of the women paused murmuring to her companion and from her purseextracted yellow ticket which she gave to Mrs Hooven with volubleexplanations
But Mrs Hooven was confused she did not understand
Whatcould the ticket mean
The women went on their way
The next person to whom she applied was young girl of about eighteenvery prettily dressed
Say say den blease hellup boor womunIn evident embarrassment the young girl paused and searched in herlittle pocketbook
think haveI thinkI have just ten cents heresomewhere she murmured again and again
In the end she found dime and dropped it into Mrs Hoovens palm
That was the beginning
The first step once taken the others becameeasy
All day long Mrs Hooven and Hilda followed the streets beggingbegging
Here it was nickel there dime here nickel again
Butshe was not expert in the art nor did she know where to buy food thecheapest and the entire days work resulted only in barely enough fortwo meals of bread milk and wretchedly cooked stew
Tuesday nightfound the pair once more shelterless
Once more Mrs Hooven and her baby passed the night on the parkbenches
But early on Wednesday morning Mrs Hooven found herselfassailed by sharp pains and cramps in her stomach
What was thecause she could not say but as the day went on the pains increasedalternating with hot flushes over all her body and certain weaknessand faintness
As the day went on the pain and the weakness increased
When she tried to walk she found she could do so only with the greatestdifficulty
Here was fresh misfortune
To beg she must walk
Draggingherself forward halfblock at time she regained the street oncemore
She succeeded in begging couple of nickels bought bag ofapples from vender and returning to the park sank exhausted upon abench
Here she remained all day until evening Hilda alternately whimperingfor her bread and milk or playing languidly in the gravel walk at herfeet
In the evening she started out again
This time it was bitterhard
Nobody seemed inclined to give
Twice she was moved on bypolicemen
Two hours begging elicited but single dime
With this shebought Hildas bread and milk and refusing herself to eat returned tothe benchthe only home she knewand spent the night shivering withcold burning with fever
From Wednesday morning till Friday evening with the exception of thefew apples she had bought and quarter of loaf of hard bread thatshe found in greasy newspaperscraps of workmans dinnerMrsHooven had nothing to eat
In her weakened condition begging becamehourly more difficult and such little money as was given her sheresolutely spent on Hildas bread and milk in the morning and evening
By Friday afternoon she was very weak indeed
Her eyes troubled her
She could no longer see distinctly and at times there appeared toher curious figures huge crystal goblets of the most graceful shapesfloating and swaying in the air in front of her almost within armsreach
Vases of elegant forms made of shimmering glass bowed andcourtesied toward her
Glass bulbs took graceful and varying shapesbefore her vision now rounding into globes now evolving intohourglasses now twisting into pretzelshaped convolutions
Mammy Im hungry insisted Hilda passing her hands over her face
Mrs Hooven started and woke
It was Friday evening
Already the streetlamps were being lit
Gome den leedle girl she said rising and taking Hildas hand
Gome den we go vind subber heyShe issued from the park and took cross street directly away from thelocality where she had begged the previous days
She had had no successthere of late
She would try some other quarter of the town
After aweary walk she came out upon Van Ness Avenue near its junction withMarket Street
She turned into the avenue and went on toward the Baypainfully traversing block after block begging of all whom she met forshe no longer made any distinction among the passersby
Say say den blease hellup boor womunMammy mammy Im hungryIt was Friday night between seven and eight
The great deserted avenuewas already dark
sea fog was scudding overhead and by degreesdescending lower
The warmth was of the meagerest and the street lampsbirds of fire in cages of glass fluttered and danced in the prolongedgusts of the trade wind that threshed and weltered in the city streetsfrom off the ocean
Presley entered the diningroom of the Gerard mansion with little MissGerard on his arm
The other guests had preceded themCedarquist withMrs Gerard palefaced languid young man introduced to Presleyas Julian Lambert with Presleys cousin Beatrice one of the twindaughters of Mr and Mrs Cedarquist his brother Stephen whosehair was straight as an Indians but of pallid straw color withBeatrices sister Gerard himself taciturn bearded rotund loud ofbreath escorted Mrs Cedarquist
Besides these there were one or twoother couples whose names Presley did not remember
The diningroom was superb in its appointments
On three sides of theroom to the height of some ten feet ran continuous picture an oilpainting divided into long sections by narrow panels of black oak
Thepainting represented the personages in the Romaunt de la Rose andwas conceived in an atmosphere of the most delicate most ephemeralallegory
One saw young chevaliers blueeyed of elemental beautyand purity women with crowns gold girdles and cloudy wimples younggirls entrancing in their loveliness wearing snowwhite kerchiefstheir golden hair unbound and flowing dressed in white samite bearingarmfuls of flowers the whole procession defiling against backgroundof forest glades venerable oaks halfhidden fountains and fields ofasphodel and roses
Otherwise the room was simple
Against the side of the wall unoccupiedby the picture stood sideboard of gigantic size that once had adornedthe banquet hall of an Italian palace of the late Renaissance
It wasblack with age and against its sombre surfaces glittered an array ofheavy silver dishes and heavier cutglass bowls and goblets
The company sat down to the first course of raw Blue Point oystersserved upon little pyramids of shaved ice and the two butlers at oncebegan filling the glasses of the guests with cool Haut Sauterne
Mrs Gerard who was very proud of her dinners and never able to resistthe temptation of commenting upon them to her guests leaned across toPresley and Mrs Cedarquist murmuring Mr
Presley do you find thatSauterne too cold
always believe it is so bourgeois to keep sucha delicate wine as Sauterne on the ice and to ice Bordeaux orBurgundyoh it is nothing short of crimeThis is from your own vineyard is it not asked Julian Lambert
Ithink recognise the bouquetHe strove to maintain an attitude of fin gourmet unable to refrain fromcomment upon the courses as they succeeded one another
Little Honora Gerard turned to PresleyYou know she explained Papa has his own vineyards in southernFrance
He is so particular about his wines turns up his nose atCalifornia wines
And am to go there next summer
Ferrieres is thename of the place where our vineyards are the dearest village She wasa beautiful little girl of dainty porcelain type her colouring lowin tone
She wore no jewels but her little undeveloped neck andshoulders of an exquisite immaturity rose from the tulle bodice of herfirst decollete gown
Yes she continued Im to go to Europe for the first time
Wont itbe gay
And am to have my own bonne and Mamma and are to travelsomany places Baden Homburg Spa the Tyrol
Wont it be gayPresley assented in meaningless words
He sipped his wine mechanicallylooking about that marvellous room with its subdued saffron lightsits glitter of glass and silver its beautiful women in their elaboratetoilets its deft correct servants its array of tablewarecut glasschased silver and Dresden crockery
It was Wealth in all its outwardand visible forms the signs of an opulence so great that it need neverbe husbanded
It was the home of railway Magnate Railroad King
For this then the farmers paid
It was for this that Behrman turnedthe screw tightened the vise
It was for this that Dyke had been drivento outlawry and jail
It was for this that Lyman Derrick had beenbought the Governor ruined and broken Annixter shot down Hoovenkilled
The soup puree la Derby was served and at the same time as horsdoeuvres ortolan patties together with tiny sandwich made ofbrowned toast and thin slices of ham sprinkled over with Parmesancheese
The wine so Mrs Gerard caused it to be understood was Xeresof the vintage
Mrs Hooven crossed the avenue
It was growing late
Without knowingit she had come to part of the city that experienced beggars shunned
There was nobody about
Block after block of residences stretchedaway on either hand lighted full of people
But the sidewalks weredeserted
Mammy whimpered Hilda
Im tired carry meUsing all her strength Mrs Hooven picked her up and moved onaimlessly
Then again that terrible cry the cry of the hungry child appealing tothe helpless motherMammy Im hungryAch Gott leedle girl exclaimed Mrs Hooven holding her close toher shoulder the tears starting from her eyes
Ach leedle tochter
Doand doand doand
You praik my hairt
cent vind any subber
We gotnoddings to eat noddings noddingsWhen do we have those breadn milk again MammyTomorrowsoonpyandpy Hilda
doand know what pecome oaf us nowwhat pecome oaf my leedle babbyShe went on holding Hilda against her shoulder with one arm as best shemight one hand steadying herself against the fence railings along thesidewalk
At last solitary pedestrian came into view young manin top hat and overcoat walking rapidly
Mrs Hooven held out aquivering hand as he passed her
Say say den Meestr blease hellup boor womunThe other hurried on
The fish course was grenadins of bass and small salmon the latterstuffed and cooked in white wine and mushroom liquor
have read your poem of course Mr Presley observed Mrs Gerard
The Toilers mean
What sermon you read us you dreadful youngman
felt that ought at once to sell all that have and give tothe poor
Positively it did stir me up
You may congratulate yourselfupon making at least one convert
Just because of that poem MrsCedarquist and have started movement to send whole shipload ofwheat to the starving people in India
Now you horrid reactionnaireare you satisfiedI am very glad murmured Presley
But am afraid observed Mrs Cedarquist that we may be too late
They are dying so fast those poor people
By the time our ship reachesIndia the famine may be all overOne need never be afraid of being too late in the matter of helpingthe destitute answered Presley
Unfortunately they are always afixed quantity
The poor ye have always with you
How very clever that is said Mrs Gerard
Mrs Cedarquist tapped the table with her fan in mild applause
Brilliant brilliant she murmured epigrammaticalHonora said Mrs Gerard turning to her daughter at that moment inconversation with the languid Lambert Honora entendstu ma cherielesprit de notre jeune LamartineMrs Hooven went on stumbling from street to street holding Hilda toher breast
Famine gnawed incessantly at her stomach walk though shemight turn upon her tracks up and down the streets back to the avenueagain incessantly and relentlessly the torture dug into her vitals
She was hungry hungry and if the want of food harassed and rendedher fullgrown woman that she was what must it be in the poor starvedstomach of her little girl
Oh for some helping hand now oh for onelittle mouthful one little nibble
Food food all her wrecked bodyclamoured for nourishment anything to numb those gnawing teethanabandoned loaf hard mouldered halfeaten fruit yes even therefuse of the gutter even the garbage of the ash heap
On she wentpeering into dark corners into the areaways anywhere everywherewatching the silent prowling of cats the intent rovings of straydogs
But she was growing weaker the pains and cramps in her stomachreturned
Hildas weight bore her to the pavement
More than once agreat giddiness certain wheeling faintness all but overcame her
Hilda however was asleep
To wake her would only mean to revive her tothe consciousness of hunger yet how to carry her further
Mrs Hoovenbegan to fear that she would fall with her child in her arms
The terrorof collapse upon those cold pavements glistening with fogdamp rousedher she must make an effort to get through the night
She rallied allher strength and pausing moment to shift the weight of her baby tothe other arm once more set off through the night
little while latershe found on the edge of the sidewalk the peeling of banana
It hadbeen trodden upon and it was muddy but joyfully she caught it up
Hilda she cried wake oop leedle girl
See loog den deressomedings to eat
Look den hey
Dats goot aint it
Zum bunanerBut it could not be eaten
Decayed dirty all but rotting the stomachturned from the refuse nauseated
No no cried Hilda thats not good
cant eat it
Oh Mammyplease gif me those breadn milkBy now the guests of Mrs Gerard had come to the entreesLondonderrypheasants escallops of duck and rissolettes la pompadour
The winewas Chateau Latour
All around the table conversations were going forward gayly
The goodwines had broken up the slight restraint of the early part of theevening and spirit of good humour and good fellowship prevailed
YoungLambert and Mr Gerard were deep in reminiscences of certain mutualduckshooting expeditions
Mrs Gerard and Mrs Cedarquist discusseda novela strange mingling of psychology degeneracy and analysisof erotic conditionswhich had just been translated from the Italian
Stephen Lambert and Beatrice disputed over the merits of Scotch colliejust given to the young lady
The scene was gay the electric bulbssparkled the wine flashing back the light
The entire table was vagueglow of white napery delicate china and glass as brilliant as crystal
Behind the guests the servingmen came and went filling the glassescontinually changing the covers serving the entrees managing thedinner without interruption confusion or the slightest unnecessarynoise
But Presley could find no enjoyment in the occasion
From that pictureof feasting that scene of luxury that atmosphere of decorouswellbred refinement his thoughts went back to Los Muertos and QuienSabe and the irrigating ditch at Hoovens
He saw them fall one by oneHarran Annixter Osterman Broderson Hooven
The clink of the wineglasses was drowned in the explosion of revolvers
The Railroad mightindeed be force only which no man could control and for which no manwas responsible but his friends had been killed but years of extortionand oppression had wrung money from all the San Joaquin money that hadmade possible this very scene in which he found himself
Because Magnushad been beggared Gerard had become Railroad King because the farmersof the valley were poor these men were rich
The fancy grew big in his mind distorted caricatured terrible
Because the farmers had been killed at the irrigation ditch theseothers Gerard and his family fed full
They fattened on the blood ofthe People on the blood of the men who had been killed at the ditch
It was halfludicrous halfhorrible dog eat dog an unspeakablecannibalism
Harran Annixter and Hooven were being devoured thereunder his eyes
These dainty women his cousin Beatrice and little MissGerard frail delicate all these fine ladies with their small fingersand slender necks suddenly were transfigured in his tortured mind intoharpies tearing human flesh
His head swam with the horror of it theterror of it
Yes the People WOULD turn some day and turning rendthose who now preyed upon them
It would be dog eat dog again withpositions reversed and he saw for one instant of time that splendidhouse sacked to its foundations the tables overturned the picturestorn the hangings blazing and Liberty the redhanded Man in theStreet grimed with powder smoke foul with the gutter rush yellingtorch in hand through every door
At ten oclock Mrs Hooven fell
Luckily she was leading Hilda by the hand at the time and the littlegirl was not hurt
In vain had Mrs Hooven hour after hour walked thestreets
After while she no longer made any attempt to beg nobody wasstirring nor did she even try to hunt for food with the stray dogs andcats
She had made up her mind to return to the park in order tosit upon the benches there but she had mistaken the direction andfollowing up Sacramento Street had come out at length not upon thepark but upon great vacant lot at the very top of the Clay Streethill
The ground was unfenced and rose above her to form the cap of thehill all overgrown with bushes and few stunted live oaks
It was intrying to cross this piece of ground that she fell
She got upon herfeet again
Ach Mammy did you hurt yourself asked Hilda
No noIs that house where we get those breadn milkHilda pointed to single rambling building just visible in the nightthat stood isolated upon the summit of the hill in grove of trees
No no dere aindt no braid end miluk leedle tochterHilda once more began to sob
Ach Mammy please PLEASE want it
Im hungryThe jangled nerves snapped at last under the tension and Mrs Hoovensuddenly shaking Hilda roughly cried out Stop stop
Doand say utegen you
My Gott you kill me yetBut quick upon this came the reaction
The mother caught her littlegirl to her sinking down upon her knees putting her arms around herholding her close
No no gry all so mudge es you want
Say dot you are hongry
Say utegen say ut all de dime ofer end ofer egen
Say ut poor starfingleedle babby
Oh mein poor leedle tochter
My Gott oh go crazybretty soon guess

Put der armsroundt me soh tighd leedle babby
We gowun to die we gowun to vindPopper
We aindt gowun to be hongry eny moreVair we go now demanded Hilda
No places
Mommers soh tiredt
We stop heir leedle while end restUnderneath large bush that afforded little shelter from the windMrs Hooven lay down taking Hilda in her arms and wrapping her shawlabout her
The infinite vast night expanded gigantic all around them
At this elevation they were far above the city
It was still
Closeoverhead whirled the chariots of the fog galloping landward smotheringlights blurring outlines
Soon all sight of the town was shut out eventhe solitary house on the hilltop vanished
There was nothing left butgrey wheeling fog and the mother and child alone shivering in alittle strip of damp ground an island drifting aimlessly in emptyspace
Hildas fingers touched leaf from the bush and instinctively closedupon it and carried it to her mouth
Mammy she said Im eating those leaf
Is those goodHer mother did not reply
You going to sleep Mammy inquired Hilda touching her face
Mrs Hooven roused herself little
Vat you say
Yais guess wass asleepHer voice trailed unintelligibly to silence again
She was not howeverasleep
Her eyes were open
grateful numbness had begun to creep overher pleasing semiinsensibility
She no longer felt the pain andcramps of her stomach even the hunger was ceasing to bite
These stuffed artichokes are delicious Mrs Gerard murmured youngLambert wiping his lips with corner of his napkin
Pardon me formentioning it but your dinner must be my excuseAnd this asparagussince Mr Lambert has set the bad example observed Mrs Cedarquist so delicate such an exquisite flavour
Howdo you manageWe get all our asparagus from the southern part of the State from oneparticular ranch explained Mrs Gerard
We order it by wire and getit only twenty hours after cutting
My husband sees to it that it isput on special train
It stops at this ranch just to take on ourasparagus
Extravagant isnt it but simply cannot eat asparagus thathas been cut more than dayNor exclaimed Julian Lambert who posed as an epicure
can tellto an hour just how long asparagus has been pickedFancy eating ordinary market asparagus said Mrs Gerard that hasbeen fingered by Heaven knows how many handsMammy mammy wake up cried Hilda trying to push open Mrs Hoovenseyelids at last closed
Mammy dont
Youre just trying to frightenmeFeebly Hilda shook her by the shoulder
At last Mrs Hoovens lipsstirred
Putting her head down Hilda distinguished the whispered wordsIm sick
Go to schleepSickNoddings to eatThe dessert was wonderful preparation of alternate layers of biscuitglaces ice cream and candied chestnuts
Delicious is it not observed Julian Lambert partly to himselfpartly to Miss Cedarquist
This Moscovite fouetteupon my word havenever tasted its equalAnd you should know shouldnt you returned the young lady
Mammy mammy wake up cried Hilda
Dont sleep so
Im frightenedtRepeatedly she shook her repeatedly she tried to raise the inerteyelids with the point of her finger
But her mother no longer stirred
The gaunt lean body with its bony face and sunken eyesockets layback prone upon the ground the feet upturned and showing the raggedworn soles of the shoes the forehead and grey hair beaded with fog thepoor faded bonnet awry the poor faded dress soiled and torn
Hildadrew close to her mother kissing her face twining her arms aroundher neck
For long time she lay that way alternately sobbing andsleeping
Then after long time there was stir
She woke from adoze to find police officer and two or three other men bending overher
Some one carried lantern
Terrified smitten dumb she was unableto answer the questions put to her
Then woman evidently mistressof the house on the top of the hill arrived and took Hilda in her armsand cried over her
Ill take the little girl she said to the police officer
But the mother can you save her
Is she too far goneIve sent for doctor replied the other
Just before the ladies left the table young Lambert raised his glass ofMadeira
Turning towards the wife of the Railroad King he saidMy best compliments for delightful dinnerThe doctor who had been bending over Mrs Hooven rose
Its no use he said she has been dead some timeexhaustion fromstarvationCHAPTER IXOn Division Number Three of the Los Muertos ranch the wheat had alreadybeen cut and Behrman on certain morning in the first week ofAugust drove across the open expanse of stubble toward the southwesthis eyes searching the horizon for the feather of smoke that wouldmark the location of the steam harvester
However he saw nothing
Thestubble extended onward apparently to the very margin of the world
At length Behrman halted his buggy and brought out his field glassesfrom beneath the seat
He stood up in his place and adjusting thelenses swept the prospect to the south and west
It was the same asthough the sea of land were in reality the ocean and he lost in anopen boat were scanning the waste through his glasses looking for thesmoke of steamer hull down below the horizon
Wonder he mutteredif theyre working on Four this morningAt length he murmured an Ah of satisfaction
Far to the south intothe white sheen of sky immediately over the horizon he made out afaint smudgethe harvester beyond doubt
Thither Behrman turned his horses head
It was all of an hoursdrive over the uneven ground and through the crackling stubble but atlength he reached the harvester
He found however that it had beenhalted
The sack sewers together with the headerman were stretchedon the ground in the shade of the machine while the engineer andseparatorman were pottering about portion of the works
Whats the matter Billy demanded Behrman reining up
The engineer turned about
The grain is heavy in here
We thought wed better increase the speedof the cupcarrier and pulled up to put in smaller sprocketS Behrman nodded to say that was all right and added question
How is she goingAnywheres from twentyfive to thirty sacks to the acre right alonghere nothing the matter with THAT guessNothing in the world BillOne of the sack sewers interposedFor the last half hour weve been throwing off three bags to theminuteThats good thats goodIt was more than good it was bonanza and all that division of thegreat ranch was thick with just such wonderful wheat
Never had LosMuertos been more generous never season more successful
Behrmandrew long breath of satisfaction
He knew just how great was his sharein the lands which had just been absorbed by the corporation he servedjust how many thousands of bushels of this marvellous crop were hisproperty
Through all these years of confusion bickerings openhostility and at last actual warfare he had waited nursing hispatience calm with the firm assurance of ultimate success
The end atlength had come he had entered into his reward and saw himself at lastinstalled in the place he had so long so silently coveted saw himselfchief of principality the Master of the Wheat
The sprocket adjusted the engineer called up the gang and the men tooktheir places
The fireman stoked vigorously the two sack sewers resumedtheir posts on the sacking platform putting on the goggles that keptthe chaff from their eyes
The separatorman and headerman grippedtheir levers
The harvester shooting column of thick smoke straight upwardvibrating to the top of the stack hissed clanked and lurched forward
Instantly motion sprang to life in all its component parts the headerknives cutting thirtysix foot swath gnashed like teeth beltingsslid and moved like smooth flowing streams the separator whirredthe agitator jarred and crashed cylinders augers fans seeders andelevators drapers and chaffcarriers clattered rumbled buzzed andclanged
The steam hissed and rasped the ground reverberated hollownote and the thousands upon thousands of wheat stalks sliced andslashed in the clashing shears of the header rattled like dry rushes ina hurricane as they fell inward and were caught up by an endless beltto disappear into the bowels of the vast brute that devoured them
It was that and no less
It was the feeding of some prodigious monsterinsatiable with iron teeth gnashing and threshing into the fieldsof standing wheat devouring always never glutted never satiatedswallowing an entire harvest snarling and slobbering in welter ofwarm vapour acrid smoke and blinding pungent clouds of chaff
Itmoved bellydeep in the standing grain hippopotamus halfmired inriver ooze gorging rushes snorting sweating dinosaur wallowingthrough thick hot grasses floundering there crouching grovellingthere as its vast jaws crushed and tore and its enormous gulletswallowed incessant ravenous and inordinate
Behrman very much amused changed places with one of the sacksewers allowing him to hold his horse while he mounted the sackingplatform and took his place
The trepidation and jostling of the machineshook him till his teeth chattered in his head
His ears were shockedand assaulted by myriadtongued clamour clashing steel strainingbelts jarring woodwork while the impalpable chaff powder from theseparators settled like dust in his hair his ears eyes and mouth
Directly in front of where he sat on the platform was the chute fromthe cleaner and from this into the mouth of halffull sack spouted anunending gush of grain winnowed cleaned threshed ready for the mill
The pour from the chute of the cleaner had for Behrman an immensesatisfaction
Without an instants pause thick rivulet of wheatrolled and dashed tumultuous into the sack
In half minutesometimesin twenty secondsthe sack was full was passed over to the secondsewer the mouth reeved up and the sack dumped out upon the ground tobe picked up by the wagons and hauled to the railroad
Behrman hypnotised sat watching that river of grain
All thatshrieking bellowing machinery all that gigantic organism all themonths of labour the ploughing the planting the prayers for rain theyears of preparation the heartaches the anxiety the foresight allthe whole business of the ranch the work of horses of steam of menand boys looked to this spotthe grain chute from the harvester intothe sacks
Its volume was the index of failure or success of riches orpoverty
And at this point the labour of the rancher ended
Here atthe lip of the chute he parted company with his grain and from herethe wheat streamed forth to feed the world
The yawning mouths of thesacks might well stand for the unnumbered mouths of the People allagape for food and here into these sacks at first so lean soflaccid attenuated like starved stomachs rushed the living streamof food insistent interminable filling the empty fattening theshrivelled making it sleek and heavy and solid
Half an hour later the harvester stopped again
The men on the sackingplatform had used up all the sacks
But Behrmans foreman newman on Los Muertos put in an appearance with the report that the wagonbringing fresh supply was approaching
How is the grain elevator at Port Costa getting on sirFinished replied Behrman
The new master of Los Muertos had decided upon accumulating his grain inbulk in great elevator at the tidewater port where the grain shipsfor Liverpool and the East took on their cargoes
To this end he hadbought and greatly enlarged building at Port Costa that was alreadyin use for that purpose and to this elevator all the crop of LosMuertos was to be carried
The and made Behrman specialrate
By the way said Behrman to his superintendent were in luck
Fallons buyer was in Bonneville yesterday
Hes buying for Fallon andfor Holt too
happened to run into him and Ive sold ship loadA ship loadOf Los Muertos wheat
Hes acting for some Indian Famine ReliefCommitteelot of women people up in the cityand wanted whole cargo
made deal with him
Theres about fifty thousand tons of disengagedshipping in San Francisco Bay right now and ships are fighting forcharters
wired McKissick and got long distance telephone from himthis morning
He got me barque the Swanhilda
Shell dock day aftertomorrow and begin loadingHadnt better take run up observed the superintendent and keepan eye on thingsNo answered Behrman want you to stop down here and see thatthose carpenters hustle the work in the ranch house
Derrick will beout by then
You see this deal is peculiar
Im not selling to anymiddlemannot to Fallons buyer
He only put me on to the thing
Imacting direct with these women people and Ive got to have some hand inshipping this stuff myself
But made my selling figure cover the priceof charter
Its queer mixedup deal and dont fancy it muchbut theres boodle in it
Ill go to Port Costa myselfA little later on in the day when Behrman had satisfied himself thathis harvesting was going forward favourably he reentered his buggyand driving to the County Road turned southward towards the Los Muertosranch house
He had not gone far however before he became aware ofa familiar figure on horseback jogging slowly along ahead of him
Herecognised Presley he shook the reins over his horses back and verysoon ranging up by the side of the young man passed the time of day withhim
Well what brings you down here again Mr Presley he observed
Ithought we had seen the last of youI came down to say goodbye to my friends answered Presley shortly
Going awayYesto IndiaWell upon my word
For your health heyYesYou LOOK knocked up asserted the other
By the way he added Isuppose youve heard the newsPresley shrank little
Of late the reports of disasters had followedso swiftly upon one another that he had begun to tremble and to quail atevery unexpected bit of information
What news do you mean he asked
About Dyke
He has been convicted
The judge sentenced him for lifeFor life
Riding on by the side of this man through the ranches bythe County Road Presley repeated these words to himself till the fulleffect of them burst at last upon him
Jailed for life
No outlook
No hope for the future
Day after day yearafter year to tread the rounds of the same gloomy monotony
He saw thegrey stone walls the iron doors the flagging of the yard bare ofgrass or treesthe cell narrow bald cheerless the prison garb theprison fare and round all the grim granite of insuperable barriersshutting out the world shutting in the man with outcasts with thepariah dogs of society thieves murderers men below the beasts lostto all decency drugged with opium utter reprobates
To this Dykehad been brought Dyke than whom no man had been more honest morecourageous more jovial
This was the end of him prison this was hisfinal estate criminal
Presley found an excuse for riding on leaving Behrman behind him
He did not stop at Carahers saloon for the heat of his rage had longsince begun to cool and dispassionately he saw things in their truelight
For all the tragedy of his wifes death Caraher was none theless an evil influence among the ranchers an influence that worked onlyto the inciting of crime
Unwilling to venture himself to risk his ownlife the anarchist saloonkeeper had goaded Dyke and Presley both tomurder bad man plague spot in the world of the ranchers poisoningthe farmers bodies with alcohol and their minds with discontent
At last Presley arrived at the ranch house of Los Muertos
The placewas silent the grass on the lawn was half dead and over foot highthe beginnings of weeds showed here and there in the driveway
He tiedhis horse to ring in the trunk of one of the larger eucalyptus treesand entered the house
Mrs Derrick met him in the diningroom
The old look of uneasinessalmost of terror had gone from her wideopen brown eyes
There was inthem instead the expression of one to whom contingency longdreaded has arrived and passed
The stolidity of settled grief of anirreparable calamity of despair from which there was no escape was inher look her manner her voice
She was listless apathetic calm withthe calmness of woman who knows she can suffer no further
We are going away she told Presley as the two sat down at oppositeends of the dining table
Just Magnus and myselfall there is leftof us
There is very little money left Magnus can hardly take care ofhimself to say nothing of me
must look after him now
We are goingto MarysvilleWhy thereYou see she explained it happens that my old place is vacant inthe Seminary there
am going back to teachliterature She smiledwearily
It is beginning all over again isnt it
Only there isnothing to look forward to now
Magnus is an old man already and musttake care of himHe will go with you then Presley said that will be some comfort toyou at leastI dont know she said slowly you have not seen Magnus latelyIs hehow do you mean
Isnt he any betterWould you like to see him
He is in the office
You can go right inPresley rose
He hesitated moment thenMrs
Annixter he asked Hilmais she still with you
should liketo see her before go Go in and see Magnus said Mrs Derrick
Iwill tell her you are herePresley stepped across the stonepaved hallway with the glass roofand after knocking three times at the office door pushed it open andentered
Magnus sat in the chair before the desk and did not look up as Presleyentered
He had the appearance of man nearer eighty than sixty
Allthe oldtime erectness was broken and bent
It was as though the musclesthat once had held the back rigid the chin high had softened andstretched
certain fatness the obesity of inertia hung heavy aroundthe hips and abdomen the eye was watery and vague the cheeks and chinunshaven and unkempt the grey hair had lost its forward curl towardsthe temples and hung thin and ragged around the ears
The hawklikenose seemed hooked to meet the chin the lips were slack the mouthhalfopened
Where once the Governor had been model of neatness in his dress thefrock coat buttoned the linen clean he now sat in his shirt sleevesthe waistcoat open and showing the soiled shirt
His hands were stainedwith ink and these the only members of his body that yet appeared toretain their activity were busy with great pile of papersoblonglegal documents that littered the table before him
Without momentscessation these hands of the Governors came and went among the papersdeft nimble dexterous
Magnus was sorting papers
From the heap upon his left hand he selecteda document opened it glanced over it then tied it carefully and laidit away upon second pile on his right hand
When all the papers werein one pile he reversed the process taking from his right hand toplace upon his left then back from left to right again then once morefrom right to left
He spoke no word he sat absolutely still evenhis eyes did not move only his hands swift nervous agitated seemedalive
Why how are you Governor said Presley coming forward
Magnusturned slowly about and looked at him and at the hand in which he shookhis own
Ah he said at length PresleyyesThen his glance fell and he looked aimlessly about upon the floor
Ive come to say goodbye Governor continued Presley Im goingawayGoing awayyes why its Presley
Goodday PresleyGoodday Governor
Im going away
Ive come to say goodbyeGoodbye Magnus bent his brows what are you saying goodbye forIm going away sirThe Governor did not answer
Staring at the ledge of the desk he seemedlost in thought
There was long silence
Then at length PresleysaidHow are you getting on GovernorMagnus looked up slowly
Why its Presley he said
How do you do PresleyAre you getting on all right sirYes said Magnus after while yes all right
am going away
Ivecome to say goodbye
No He interrupted himself with deprecatorysmile YOU said THAT didnt youWell you are going away too your wife tells meYes Im going away
cant stay on he hesitated long timegroping for the right word cant stay ononwhats the name ofthis placeLos Muertos put in Presley
No it isnt
Yes it is too thats right Los Muertos
dont knowwhere my memory has gone to of lateWell hope you will be better soon GovernorAs Presley spoke the words Behrman entered the room and theGovernor sprang up with unexpected agility and stood against the walldrawing one long breath after another watching the railroad agent withintent eyes
Behrman saluted both men affably and sat down near the desk drawingthe links of his heavy watch chain through his fat fingers
There wasnt anybody outside when knocked but heard your voice inhere Governor so came right in
wanted to ask you Governor ifmy carpenters can begin work in here day after tomorrow
want to takedown that partition there and throw this room and the next into one
Iguess that will be wont it
Youll be out of here by then wontyouThere was no vagueness about Magnuss speech or manner now
There wasthat same alertness in his demeanour that one sees in tamed lion inthe presence of its trainer
Yes yes he said quickly you can send your men here
will be goneby tomorrowI dont want to seem to hurry you Governor No you will not hurryme
am ready to go nowAnything can do for you GovernorNothingYes there is Governor insisted Behrman
think now that all isover we ought to be good friends
think can do something for you
Westill want an assistant in the local freight managers office
Now whatdo you say to having try at it
Theres salary of fifty month goeswith it
guess you must be in need of money now and theres alwaysthe wife to support what do you say
Will you try the placePresley could only stare at the man in speechless wonder
What was hedriving at
What reason was there back of this new move and why shouldit be made thus openly and in his hearing
An explanation occurred tohim
Was this merely pleasantry on the part of Behrman way ofenjoying to the full his triumph was he testing the completeness ofhis victory trying to see just how far he could go how far beneath hisfeet he could push his oldtime enemy
What do you say he repeated
Will you try the placeYouyou INSIST inquired the Governor
Oh Im not insisting on anything cried Behrman
Im offering youa place thats all
Will you take itYes yes Ill take itYoull come over to our sideYes Ill come overYoull have to turn railroad understandIll turn railroadGuess there may be times when youll have to take orders from meIll take orders from youYoull have to be loyal to railroad you know
No funny businessIll be loyal to the railroadYou would like the place thenYesS Behrman turned from Magnus who at once resumed his seat and beganagain to sort his papers
Well Presley said the railroad agent guess wont see youagainI hope not answered the other
Tut tut Presley you know you cant make me angryHe put on his hat of varnished straw and wiped his fat forehead withhis handkerchief
Of late he had grown fatter than ever and the linenvest stamped with multitude of interlocked horseshoes strained tightits imitation pearl buttons across the great protuberant stomach
Presley looked at the man moment before replying
But few weeks ago he could not thus have faced the great enemy of thefarmers without gust of blind rage blowing tempestuous through all hisbones
Now however he found to his surprise that his fury hadlapsed to profound contempt in which there was bitterness but notruculence
He was tired tired to death of the whole business
Yes he answered deliberately am going away
You have ruined thisplace for me
couldnt live here where should have to see you orthe results of what you have done whenever stirred out of doorsNonsense Presley answered the other refusing to become angry
Thats foolishness that kind of talk though of course understandhow you feel
guess it was you wasnt it who threw that bomb into myhouseIt wasWell that dont show any common sense Presley returned Behrmanwith perfect aplomb
What could you have gained by killing meNot so much probably as you have gained by killing Harran and Annixter
But thats all passed now
Youre safe from me The strangeness of thistalk the oddity of the situation burst upon him and he laughed aloud
It dont seem as though you could be brought to book Behrman byanybody or by any means does it
They cant get at you through thecourtsthe law cant get you Dykes pistol missed fire for just yourbenefit and you even escaped Carahers six inches of plugged gas pipe
Just what are we going to do with youBest give it up Pres my boy returned the other
guess thereaint anything can touch me
Well Magnus he said turning once moreto the Governor
Well Ill think over what you say and let you knowif can get the place for you in day or two
You see he addedyoure getting pretty old Magnus DerrickPresley flung himself from the room unable any longer to witness thedepths into which Magnus had fallen
What other scenes of degradationwere enacted in that room how much further Behrman carried thehumiliation he did not know
He suddenly felt that the air of theoffice was choking him
He hurried up to what once had been his own room
On his way he couldnot but note that much of the house was in disarray great packingupwas in progress trunks halffull stood in the hallways crates andcases in litter of straw encumbered the rooms
The servants came andwent with armfuls of books ornaments articles of clothing
Presley took from his room only few manuscripts and notebooks and asmall valise full of his personal effects at the doorway he paused andholding the knob of the door in his hand looked back into the room avery long time
He descended to the lower floor and entered the diningroom
MrsDerrick had disappeared
Presley stood for long moment in front of thefireplace looking about the room remembering the scenes that he hadwitnessed therethe conference when Osterman had first suggested thefight for Railroad Commissioner and then later the attack on LymanDerrick and the sudden revelation of that inconceivable treachery
Butas he stood considering these things door to his right opened andHilma entered the room
Presley came forward holding out his hand all unable to believe hiseyes
It was woman grave dignified composed who advanced to meethim
Hilma was dressed in black the cut and fashion of the gown severealmost monastic
All the little feminine and contradictory daintinesseswere nowhere to be seen
Her statuesque calm evenness of contouryet remained but it was the calmness of great sorrow of infiniteresignation
Beautiful she still remained but she was older
Theseriousness of one who has gained the knowledge of the worldknowledgeof its evilseemed to envelope her
The calm gravity of greatsuffering past but not forgotten sat upon her
Not yet twentyone sheexhibited the demeanour of woman of forty
The onetime amplitude of her figure the fulness of hip and shoulderthe great deep swell from waist to throat were gone
She had grownthinner and in consequence seemed unusually almost unnaturally tall
Her neck was slender the outline of her full lips and round chin was alittle sharp her arms those wonderful beautiful arms of hers werea little shrunken
But her eyes were as wide open as always rimmedas ever by the thin intensely black line of the lashes and her brownfragrant hair was still thick still at times glittered and coruscatedin the sun
When she spoke it was with the oldtime velvety huskinessof voice that Annixter had learned to love so well
Oh it is you she said giving him her hand
You were good to wantto see me before you left
hear that you are going awayShe sat down upon the sofa
Yes Presley answered drawing chair near to her yes felt Icould not staydown here any longer
am going to take long oceanvoyage
My ship sails in few days
But you Mrs Annixter what areyou going to do
Is there any way can serve youNo she answered nothing
Papa is doing well
We are living herenowYou are wellShe made little helpless gesture with both her hands smiling verysadly
As you see she answered
As he talked Presley was looking at her intently
Her dignity was newelement in her character and the certain slender effect of her figureemphasised now by the long folds of the black gown she wore carried italmost superbly
She conveyed something of the impression of queen inexile
But she had lost none of her womanliness rather the contrary
Adversity had softened her as well as deepened her
Presley saw thatvery clearly
Hilma had arrived now at her perfect maturity she hadknown great love and she had known great grief and the woman that hadawakened in her with her affection for Annixter had been strengthenedand infinitely ennobled by his death
What if things had been different
Thus as he conversed with her Presley found himself wondering
Hersweetness her beautiful gentleness and tenderness were almost likepalpable presences
It was almost as if caress had been laid softlyupon his cheek as if gentle hand closed upon his
Here he knew wassympathy here he knew was an infinite capacity for love
Then suddenly all the tired heart of him went out towards her
longingto give the best that was in him to the memory of her to be strong andnoble because of her to reshape his purposeless halfwasted life withher nobility and purity and gentleness for his inspiration leaped all atonce within him leaped and stood firm hardening to resolve strongerthan any he had ever known
For an instant he told himself that the suddenness of this new emotionmust be evidence of its insincerity
He was perfectly well aware thathis impulses were abrupt and of short duration
But he knew that thiswas not sudden
Without realising it he had been from the first drawnto Hilma and all through these last terrible days since the time hehad seen her at Los Muertos just after the battle at the ditch she hadobtruded continually upon his thoughts
The sight of her today morebeautiful than ever quiet strong reserved had only brought mattersto culmination
Are you he asked her are you so unhappy Hilma that you can lookforward to no more brightness in your lifeUnless could forgetforget my husband she answered how can Ibe happy
would rather be unhappy in remembering him than happy inforgetting him
He was my whole world literally and truly
Nothingseemed to count before knew him and nothing can count for me nowafter have lost himYou think now he answered that in being happy again you would bedisloyal to him
But you will find after whileyears from nowthatit need not be so
The part of you that belonged to your husband canalways keep him sacred that part of you belongs to him and he to it
But you are young you have all your life to live yet
Your sorrow neednot be burden to you
If you consider it as you shouldas you WILLsome day believe meit will only be great help to you
It will makeyou more noble truer woman more generousI think see she answered and never thought about it in thatlight beforeI want to help you he answered as you have helped me
want to beyour friend and above all things do not want to see your life wasted
am going away and it is quite possible shall never see you againbut you will always be help to meI do not understand she answered but know you mean to be veryvery kind to me
Yes hope when you come backif you ever doyouwill still be that
do not know why you should want to be so kindunlessyes of courseyou were my husbands dearest friendThey talked little longer and at length Presley rose
cannot bring myself to see Mrs Derrick again he said
It wouldonly serve to make her very unhappy
Will you explain that to her
Ithink she will understandYes answered Hilma
Yes willThere was pause
There seemed to be nothing more for either of them tosay
Presley held out his hand
Goodbye she said as she gave him hers
He carried it to his lips
Goodbye he answered
Goodbye and may God bless youHe turned away abruptly and left the room
But as he was quietly makinghis way out of the house hoping to get to his horse unobserved he camesuddenly upon Mrs Dyke and Sidney on the porch of the house
He hadforgotten that since the affair at the ditch Los Muertos had been ahome to the engineers mother and daughter
And you Mrs Dyke he asked as he took her hand in this breakup ofeverything where do you goTo the city she answered to San Francisco
have sister therewho will look after the little tadBut you how about yourself Mrs DykeShe answered him in quiet voice monotonous expressionlessI am going to die very soon Mr Presley
There is no reason why Ishould live any longer
My son is in prison for life everything is overfor me and am tired worn outYou mustnt talk like that Mrs Dyke protested Presley nonsenseyou will live long enough to see the little tad married He tried tobe cheerful
But he knew his words lacked the ring of conviction
Deathalready overshadowed the face of the engineers mother
He felt thatshe spoke the truth and as he stood there speaking to her for the lasttime his arm about little Sidneys shoulder he knew that he was seeingthe beginnings of the wreck of another family and that like HildaHooven another baby girl was to be started in life through no fault ofhers fearfully handicapped weighed down at the threshold of existencewith load of disgrace
Hilda Hooven and Sidney Dyke what was to betheir histories
the one sister of an outcast the other daughter ofa convict
And he thought of that other young girl the little HonoraGerard the heiress of millions petted loved receiving adulation fromall who came near to her whose only care was to choose from amongthe multitude of pleasures that the world hastened to present to herconsideration
Goodbye he said holding out his hand
GoodbyeGoodbye SidneyHe kissed the little girl clasped Mrs Dykes hand moment with histhen slinging his satchel about his shoulders by the long strap withwhich it was provided left the house and mounting his horse rode awayfrom Los Muertos never to return
Presley came out upon the County Road
At little distance to his lefthe could see the group of buildings where once Broderson had lived
These were being remodelled at length to suit the larger demands ofthe New Agriculture
strange man came out by the road gate no doubtthe new proprietor
Presley turned away hurrying northwards along theCounty Road by the mammoth wateringtank and the long windbreak ofpoplars
He came to Carahers place
There was no change here
The saloon hadweathered the storm indispensable to the new as well as to the oldregime
The same dusty buggies and buckboards were tied under the shedand as Presley hurried by he could distinguish Carahers voice loud asever still proclaiming his creed of annihilation
Bonneville Presley avoided
He had no associations with the town
Heturned aside from the road and crossing the northwest corner of LosMuertos and the line of the railroad turned back along the Upper Roadtill he came to the Long Trestle and AnnixtersSilence desolationabandonment
vast stillness profound unbroken brooded low over all the place
Noliving thing stirred
The rusted windmill on the skeletonlike tower ofthe artesian well was motionless the great barn empty the windows ofthe ranch house cook house and dairy boarded up
Nailed upon treenear the broken gateway was board white painted with stencilledletters bearing the inscriptionWarning
ALL PERSONS FOUND TRESPASSING ON THESE PREMISES WILL BEPROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW
By order and RRAs he had planned Presley reached the hills by the head waters ofBrodersons Creek late in the afternoon
Toilfully he climbed themreached the highest crest and turning about looked long and for thelast time at all the reach of the valley unrolled beneath him
The landof the ranches opened out forever and forever under the stimulus of thatmeasureless range of vision
The whole gigantic sweep of the San Joaquinexpanded Titanic before the eye of the mind flagellated with heatquivering and shimmering under the suns red eye
It was the seasonafter the harvest and the great earth the mother after its period ofreproduction its pains of labour delivered of the fruit of its loinsslept the sleep of exhaustion in the infinite repose of the colossusbenignant eternal strong the nourisher of nations the feeder of anentire world
And as Presley looked there came to him strong and true the sense andthe significance of all the enigma of growth
He seemed for oneinstant to touch the explanation of existence
Men were nothings mereanimalculae mere ephemerides that fluttered and fell and were forgottenbetween dawn and dusk
Vanamee had said there was no death
But for onesecond Presley could go one step further
Men were naught death wasnaught life was naught FORCE only existedFORCE that brought meninto the world FORCE that crowded them out of it to make way forthe succeeding generation FORCE that made the wheat grow FORCE thatgarnered it from the soil to give place to the succeeding crop
It was the mystery of creation the stupendous miracle of recreationthe vast rhythm of the seasons measured alternative the sun and thestars keeping time as the eternal symphony of reproduction swung inits tremendous cadences like the colossal pendulum of an almightymachineprimordial energy flung out from the hand of the Lord Godhimself immortal calm infinitely strong
But as he stood thus looking down upon the great valley he was aware ofthe figure of man far in the distance moving steadily towards theMission of San Juan
The man was hardly more than dot but there wassomething unmistakably familiar in his gait and besides this Presleycould fancy that he was hatless
He touched his pony with his spur
Theman was Vanamee beyond all doubt and little later Presley descendingthe maze of cowpaths and cattletrails that led down towards theBroderson Creek overtook his friend
Instantly Presley was aware of an immense change
Vanamees face wasstill that of an ascetic still glowed with the rarefied intelligence ofa young seer halfinspired shepherdprophet of Hebraic legends butthe shadow of that great sadness which for so long had brooded overhim was gone the grief that once he had fancied deathless was indeeddead or rather swallowed up in victorious joy that radiated likesunlight at dawn from the deepset eyes and the hollow swarthy cheeks
They talked together till nearly sundown but to Presleys questionsas to the reasons for Vanamees happiness the other would say nothing
Once only he allowed himself to touch upon the subject
Death and grief are little things he said
They are transient
Life must be before death and joy before grief
Else there are no suchthings as death or grief
These are only negatives
Life is positive
Death is only the absence of life just as night is only the absence ofday and if this is so there is no such thing as death
There is onlylife and the suppression of life that we foolishly say is death
Suppression say not extinction
do not say that life returns
Life never departs
Life simply IS
For certain seasons it is hidden inthe dark but is that death extinction annihilation
take it thankGod that it is not
Does the grain of wheat hidden for certain seasonsin the dark die
The grain we think is dead RESUMES AGAIN but how
Notas one grain but as twenty
So all life
Death is only real for all thedetritus of the world for all the sorrow for all the injusticefor all the grief
Presley the good never dies evil dies crueltyoppression selfishness greedthese die but nobility but love butsacrifice but generosity but truth thank God for it small as theyare difficult as it is to discover themthese live forever these areeternal
You are all broken all cast down by what you have seen in thisvalley this hopeless struggle this apparently hopeless despair
Wellthe end is not yet
What is it that remains after all is over after thedead are buried and the hearts are broken
Look at it all from the vastheight of humanitythe greatest good to the greatest numbers
Men perish men are corrupted hearts are rent asunder butwhat remains untouched unassailable undefiled
Try to find that notonly in this but in every crisis of the worlds life and you willfind if your view be large enough that it is not evil but good thatin the end remainsThere was long pause
Presley his mind full of new thoughts held hispeace and Vanamee added at lengthI believed Angele dead
wept over her grave mourned for her as deadin corruption
She has come back to me more beautiful than ever
Do notask me any further
To put this story this idyl into words would forme be profanation
This must suffice you
Angele has returned to meand am happy
AdiosHe rose suddenly
The friends clasped each others hands
We shall probably never meet again said Vanamee but if these arethe last words ever speak to you listen to them and remember thembecause know speak the truth
Evil is shortlived
Never judge ofthe whole round of life by the mere segment you can see
The whole isin the end perfectAbruptly he took himself away
He was gone
Presley alone thoughtfulhis hands clasped behind him passed on through the rancheshereteeming with ripened wheathis face set from them forever
Not so Vanamee
For hours he roamed the countryside now through thedeserted cluster of buildings that had once been Annixters homenow through the rustling and as yet uncut wheat of Quien Sabe
nowtreading the slopes of the hills far to the north and again followingthe winding courses of the streams
Thus he spent the night
At length the day broke resplendent cloudless
The night was passed
There was all the sparkle and effervescence of joy in the crystalsunlight as the dawn expanded roseate and at length flamed dazzling tothe zenith when the sun moved over the edge of the world and looked downupon all the earth like the eye of God the Father
At the moment Vanamee stood breastdeep in the wheat in solitarycorner of the Quien Sabe rancho
He turned eastward facing thecelestial glory of the day and sent his voiceless call far from himacross the golden grain out towards the little valley of flowers
Swiftly the answer came
It advanced to meet him
The flowers of theSeed ranch were gone dried and parched by the summers sun sheddingtheir seed by handfuls to be sown again and blossom yet another time
The Seed ranch was no longer royal with colour
The roses the liliesthe carnations the hyacinths the poppies the violets the mignonetteall these had vanished the little valley was without colour where onceit had exhaled the most delicious perfume it was now odourless
Underthe blinding light of the day it stretched to its hillsides barebrown unlovely
The romance of the place had vanished but with it hadvanished the Vision
It was no longer figment of his imagination creature of dreams thatadvanced to meet Vanamee
It was Realityit was Angele in the fleshvital sane material who at last issued forth from the entrance of thelittle valley
Romance had vanished but better than romance was here
Not manifestation not dream but her very self
The night wasgone but the sun had risen the flowers had disappeared but strongvigorous noble the wheat had come
In the wheat he waited for her
He saw her coming
She was simplydressed
No fanciful wreath of tuberoses was about her head now nostrange garment of red and gold enveloped her now
It was no longeran ephemeral illusion of the night evanescent mystic but simplecountry girl coming to meet her lover
The vision of the night had beenbeautiful but what was it compared to this
Reality was better thanRomance
The simple honesty of loving trusting heart was better thana legend of flowers an hallucination of the moonlight
She came nearer
Bathed in sunlight he saw her face to face saw her hair hanging in twostraight plaits on either side of her face saw the enchanting fulnessof her lips the strange balancing movement of her head upon herslender neck
But now she was no longer asleep
The wonderful eyesviolet blue heavylidded with their perplexing oriental slant towardsthe temples were wide open and fixed upon his
From out the world of romance out of the moonlight and the star sheenout of the faint radiance of the lilies and the still air heavy withperfume she had at last come to him
The moonlight the flowers andthe dream were all vanished away
Angele was realised in the Wheat
Shestood forth in the sunlight fact and no longer fancy
He ran forward to meet her and she held out her arms to him
He caughther to him and she turning her face to his kissed him on the mouth
love you love you she murmured
Upon descending from his train at Port Costa Behrman asked to bedirected at once to where the bark Swanhilda was taking on grain
Though he had bought and greatly enlarged his new elevator at this porthe had never seen it
The work had been carried on through agents SBehrman having far too many and more pressing occupations to demandhis presence and attention
Now however he was to see the concreteevidence of his success for the first time
He picked his way across the railroad tracks to the line of warehousesthat bordered the docks numbered with enormous Roman numerals and fullof grain in bags
The sight of these bags of grain put him in mind ofthe fact that among all the other shippers he was practically alonein his way of handling his wheat
They handled the grain in bagshe however preferred it in the bulk
Bags were sometimes four centsapiece and he had decided to build his elevator and bulk his graintherein rather than to incur this expense
Only small part of hiswheatthat on Number Three divisionhad been sacked
All the restpractically twothirds of the entire harvest of Los Muertos now founditself warehoused in his enormous elevator at Port Costa
To certain degree it had been the desire of observing the working ofhis system of handling the wheat in bulk that had drawn Behrman toPort Costa
But the more powerful motive had been curiosity not to saydownright sentiment
So long had he planned for this day of triumphso eagerly had he looked forward to it that now when it had come hewished to enjoy it to its fullest extent wished to miss no feature ofthe disposal of the crop
He had watched it harvested he had watched ithauled to the railway and now would watch it as it poured into the holdof the ship would even watch the ship as she cleared and got under way
He passed through the warehouses and came out upon the dock that ranparallel with the shore of the bay
great quantity of shipping was inview barques for the most part Cape Horners great deep sea trampswhose ironshod forefeet had parted every ocean the world round fromRangoon to Rio Janeiro and from Melbourne to Christiania
Some werestill in the stream loaded with wheat to the Plimsoll mark readyto depart with the next tide
But many others laid their great flanksalongside the docks and at that moment were being filled by derrickand crane with thousands upon thousands of bags of wheat
The scene wasbrisk the cranes creaked and swung incessantly with rattle ofchains stevedores and wharfingers toiled and perspired boatswainsand dockmasters shouted orders drays rumbled the water lapped atthe piles group of sailors painting the flanks of one of the greatships raised an occasional chanty the trade wind sang aeolian in thecordages filling the air with the nimble taint of salt
All around werethe noises of ships and the feel and flavor of the sea
Behrman soon discovered his elevator
It was the largest structurediscernible and upon its red roof in enormous white letters was hisown name
Thither between piles of grain bags halted drays cratesand boxes of merchandise with an occasional pyramid of salmon cases SBehrman took his way
Cabled to the dock close under his elevator laya great ship with lofty masts and great spars
Her stern was toward himas he approached and upon it in raised golden letters he could readthe words SwanhildaLiverpoolHe went aboard by very steep gangway and found the mate on the quarterdeck
Behrman introduced himself
Well he added how are you getting onVery fairly sir returned the mate who was an Englishman
Wellhave her all snugged down tight by this time day after tomorrow
Itsa great saving of time shunting the stuff in her like that and threemen can do the work of sevenIll have look round believe returned Behrman
Rightoh answered the mate with nod
Behrman went forward to the hatch that opened down into the vast holdof the ship
great iron chute connected this hatch with the elevatorand through it was rushing veritable cataract of wheat
It came from some gigantic bin within the elevator itself rushing downthe confines of the chute to plunge into the roomy gloomy interiorof the hold with an incessant metallic roar persistent steadyinevitable
No men were in sight
The place was deserted
No humanagency seemed to be back of the movement of the wheat
Rather thegrain seemed impelled with force of its own resistless huge forceeager vivid impatient for the sea
Behrman stood watching his ears deafened with the roar of the hardgrains against the metallic lining of the chute
He put his hand onceinto the rushing tide and the contact rasped the flesh of his fingersand like an undertow drew his hand after it in its impetuous dash
Cautiously he peered down into the hold
musty odour rose to hisnostrils the vigorous pungent aroma of the raw cereal
It was dark
Hecould see nothing but all about and over the opening of the hatch theair was full of fine impalpable dust that blinded the eyes and chokedthe throat and nostrils
As his eyes became used to the shadows of the cavern below him hebegan to distinguish the grey mass of the wheat great expanse almostliquid in its texture which as the cataract from above plunged intoit moved and shifted in long slow eddies
As he stood there thiscataract on sudden increased in volume
He turned about casting hiseyes upward toward the elevator to discover the cause
His foot caughtin coil of rope and he fell headforemost into the hold
The fall was long one and he struck the surface of the wheat withthe sodden impact of bundle of damp clothes
For the moment he wasstunned
All the breath was driven from his body
He could neithermove nor cry out
But by degrees his wits steadied themselves and hisbreath returned to him
He looked about and above him
The daylight inthe hold was dimmed and clouded by the thick chaffdust thrown off bythe pour of grain and even this dimness dwindled to twilight at shortdistance from the opening of the hatch while the remotest quarters werelost in impenetrable blackness
He got upon his feet only to find thathe sunk ankle deep in the loose packed mass underfoot
Hell he muttered heres fixDirectly underneath the chute the wheat as it poured in raised itselfin conical mound but from the sides of this mound it shuntedaway incessantly in thick layers flowing in all directions with thenimbleness of water
Even as Behrman spoke wave of grain pouredaround his legs and rose rapidly to the level of his knees
He steppedquickly back
To stay near the chute would soon bury him to the waist
No doubt there was some other exit from the hold some companion ladderthat led up to the deck
He scuffled and waded across the wheat gropingin the dark with outstretched hands
With every inhalation he chokedfilling his mouth and nostrils more with dust than with air
At times hecould not breathe at all but gagged and gasped his lips distended
Butsearch as he would he could find no outlet to the hold no stairwayno companion ladder
Again and again staggering along in the blackdarkness he bruised his knuckles and forehead against the iron sidesof the ship
He gave up the attempt to find any interior means of escapeand returned laboriously to the space under the open hatchway
Alreadyhe could see that the level of the wheat was raised
God he said this isnt going to do at all He uttered greatshout
Hello on deck there somebody
For Gods sakeThe steady metallic roar of the pouring wheat drowned out his voice
Hecould scarcely hear it himself above the rush of the cataract
Besidesthis he found it impossible to stay under the hatch
The flying grainsof wheat spattering as they fell stung his face like winddrivenparticles of ice
It was veritable torture his hands smarted with it
Once he was all but blinded
Furthermore the succeeding waves of wheatrolling from the mound under the chute beat him back swirling anddashing against his legs and knees mounting swiftly higher carryinghim off his feet
Once more he retreated drawing back from beneath the hatch
He stoodstill for moment and shouted again
It was in vain
His voice returnedupon him unable to penetrate the thunder of the chute and horrifiedhe discovered that so soon as he stood motionless upon the wheat hesank into it
Before he knew it he was kneedeep again and longswirl of grain sweeping outward from the everbreaking everreformingpyramid below the chute poured around his thighs immobolising him
frenzy of terror suddenly leaped to life within him
The horror ofdeath the Fear of The Trap shook him like dry reed
Shouting hetore himself free of the wheat and once more scrambled and struggledtowards the hatchway
He stumbled as he reached it and fell directlybeneath the pour
Like storm of small shot mercilessly pitilesslythe unnumbered multitude of hurtling grains flagellated and beat andtore his flesh
Blood streamed from his forehead and thickening withthe powderlike chaffdust blinded his eyes
He struggled to his feetonce more
An avalanche from the cone of wheat buried him to his thighs
He was forced back and back and back beating the air falling risinghowling for aid
He could no longer see his eyes crammed with dustsmarted as if transfixed with needles whenever he opened them
His mouthwas full of the dust his lips were dry with it thirst tortured himwhile his outcries choked and gagged in his rasped throat
And all the while without stop incessantly inexorably the wheat asif moving with force all its own shot downward in prolonged roarpersistent steady inevitable
He retreated to far corner of the hold and sat down with his backagainst the iron hull of the ship and tried to collect his thoughts tocalm himself
Surely there must be some way of escape surely he was notto die like this die in this dreadful substance that was neither solidnor fluid
What was he to do
How make himself heard
But even as he thought about this the cone under the chute broke againand sent great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward him
Itreached him where he sat and buried his hand and one foot
He sprang up trembling and made for another corner
By God he cried by God must think of something pretty quickOnce more the level of the wheat rose and the grains began piling deeperabout him
Once more he retreated
Once more he crawled staggering tothe foot of the cataract screaming till his ears sang and his eyeballsstrained in their sockets and once more the relentless tide drove himback
Then began that terrible dance of death the man dodging doublingsquirming hunted from one corner to another the wheat slowlyinexorably flowing rising spreading to every angle to every nookand cranny
It reached his middle
Furious and with bleeding hands andbroken nails he dug his way out to fall backward all but exhaustedgasping for breath in the dustthickened air
Roused again by the slowadvance of the tide he leaped up and stumbled away blinded with theagony in his eyes only to crash against the metal hull of the vessel
He turned about the blood streaming from his face and paused tocollect his senses and with rush another wave swirled about hisankles and knees
Exhaustion grew upon him
To stand still meant tosink to lie or sit meant to be buried the quicker and all this in thedark all this in an air that could scarcely be breathed all this whilehe fought an enemy that could not be gripped toiling in sea thatcould not be stayed
Guided by the sound of the falling wheat Behrman crawled on handsand knees toward the hatchway
Once more he raised his voice in shoutfor help
His bleeding throat and raw parched lips refused to utterbut wheezing moan
Once more he tried to look toward the one patch offaint light above him
His eyelids clogged with chaff could no longeropen
The Wheat poured about his waist as he raised himself upon hisknees
Reason fled
Deafened with the roar of the grain blinded and made dumbwith its chaff he threw himself forward with clutching fingers rollingupon his back and lay there moving feebly the head rolling from sideto side
The Wheat leaping continuously from the chute poured aroundhim
It filled the pockets of the coat it crept up the sleeves andtrouser legs it covered the great protuberant stomach it ran at lastin rivulets into the distended gasping mouth
It covered the face
Uponthe surface of the Wheat under the chute nothing moved but the Wheatitself
There was no sign of life
Then for an instant the surfacestirred
hand fat with short fingers and swollen veins reached upclutching then fell limp and prone
In another instant it was covered
In the hold of the Swanhilda there was no movement but the wideningripples that spread flowing from the everbreaking everreformingcone no sound but the rushing of the Wheat that continued to plungeincessantly from the iron chute in prolonged roar persistent steadyinevitable
CONCLUSIONThe Swanhilda cast off from the docks at Port Costa two days afterPresley had left Bonneville and the ranches and made her way up to SanFrancisco anchoring in the stream off the City front
few hours afterher arrival Presley waiting at his club received despatch fromCedarquist to the effect that she would clear early the next morning andthat he must be aboard of her before midnight
He sent his trunks aboard and at once hurried to Cedarquists office tosay goodbye
He found the manufacturer in excellent spirits
What do you think of Lyman Derrick now Presley he said when Presleyhad sat down
Hes in the new politics with vengeance isnt he
Andour own dear Railroad openly acknowledges him as their candidate
Youveheard of his canvassYes yes answered Presley
Well he knows his business bestBut Cedarquist was full of another idea his new venturethe organizingof line of clipper wheat ships for Pacific and Oriental tradewasprospering
The Swanhilda is the mother of the fleet Pres
had to buy HER butthe keel of her sister ship will be laid by the time she discharges atCalcutta
Well carry our wheat into Asia yet
The AngloSaxon startedfrom there at the beginning of everything and its manifest destiny thathe must circle the globe and fetch up where he began his march
You areup with procession Pres going to India this way in wheat ship thatflies American colours
By the way do you know where the money is tocome from to build the sister ship of the Swanhilda
From the saleof the plant and scrap iron of the Atlas Works
Yes Ive given it updefinitely that business
The people here would not back me up
But Imworking off on this new line now
It may break me but well try it on
You know the Million Dollar Fair was formally opened yesterday
Thereis he added with wink Midway Pleasance in connection with thething

Goodbye to youGoodbye sirGet fat yourself while youre about it Presley he observed as thetwo stood up and shook hands
There shouldnt be any lack of food on wheat ship
Bread enoughsurelyLittle monotonous though
Man cannot live by bread alone
Wellyoure really off
GoodbyeGoodbye sirAnd as Presley issued from the building and stepped out into the streethe was abruptly aware of great wagon shrouded in white cloth insideof which bass drum was being furiously beaten
On the cloth in greatletters were the wordsVote for Lyman Derrick Regular Republican Nominee for Governor ofCaliforniaThe Swanhilda lifted and rolled slowly majestically on the groundswell of the Pacific the water hissing and boiling under her forefoother cordage vibrating and droning in the steady rush of the trade winds
It was drawing towards evening and her lights had just been set
The master passed Presley who was leaning over the rail smoking acigarette and paused long enough to remarkThe land yonder if you can make it out is Point Gordo and if youwere to draw line from our position now through that point and carryit on about hundred miles further it would just about cross TulareCounty not very far from where you used to liveI see answered Presley see
am glad to know thatThe master passed on and Presley going up to the quarter deck lookedlong and earnestly at the faint line of mountains that showed vague andbluish above the waste of tumbling water
Those were the mountains of the Coast range and beyond them was whatonce had been his home
Bonneville was there and Guadalajara andLos Muertos and Quien Sabe the Mission of San Juan the Seed ranchAnnixters desolated home and Dykes ruined hopfields
Well it was all over now that terrible drama through which he hadlived
Already it was far distant from him but once again it rose inhis memory portentous sombre ineffaceable
He passed it all in reviewfrom the day of his first meeting with Vanamee to the day of his partingwith Hilma
He saw it allthe great sweep of country opening to viewfrom the summit of the hills at the head waters of Brodersons Creekthe barn dance at Annixters the harness room with its jam of furiousmen the quiet garden of the Mission Dykes house his flight upon theengine his brave fight in the chaparral Lyman Derrick at bay in thediningroom of the ranch house the rabbit drive the fight at theirrigating ditch the shouting mob in the Bonneville Opera House
Thedrama was over
The fight of Ranch and Railroad had been wrought outto its dreadful close
It was true as Shelgrim had said that forcesrather than men had locked horns in that struggle but for all that themen of the Ranch and not the men of the Railroad had suffered
Into theprosperous valley into the quiet community of farmers that gallopingmonster that terror of steel and steam had burst shooting athwart thehorizons flinging the echo of its thunder over all the ranches of thevalley leaving blood and destruction in its path
Yes the Railroad had prevailed
The ranches had been seized in thetentacles of the octopus the iniquitous burden of extortionate freightrates had been imposed like yoke of iron
The monster had killedHarran had killed Osterman had killed Broderson had killed Hooven
Ithad beggared Magnus and had driven him to state of semiinsanity afterhe had wrecked his honour in the vain attempt to do evil that good mightcome
It had enticed Lyman into its toils to pluck from him his manhoodand his honesty corrupting him and poisoning him beyond redemption ithad hounded Dyke from his legitimate employment and had made of hima highwayman and criminal
It had cast forth Mrs Hooven to starve todeath upon the City streets
It had driven Minna to prostitution
It hadslain Annixter at the very moment when painfully and manfully he had atlast achieved his own salvation and stood forth resolved to do right toact unselfishly and to live for others
It had widowed Hilma in the verydawn of her happiness
It had killed the very babe within the motherswomb strangling life ere yet it had been born stamping out the sparkordained by God to burn through all eternity
What then was left
Was there no hope no outlook for the future norift in the black curtain no glimmer through the night
Was good to bethus overthrown
Was evil thus to be strong and to prevail
Was nothingleft
Then suddenly Vanamees words came back to his mind
What was the largerview what contributed the greatest good to the greatest numbers
Whatwas the full round of the circle whose segment only he beheld
In theend the ultimate final end of all what was left
Yes good issuedfrom this crisis untouched unassailable undefiled
Menmotes in the sunshineperished were shot down in the very noonof life hearts were broken little children started in life lamentablyhandicapped young girls were brought to life of shame old women diedin the heart of life for lack of food
In that little isolated group ofhuman insects misery death and anguish spun like wheel of fire
BUT THE WHEAT REMAINED
Untouched unassailable undefiled that mightyworldforce that nourisher of nations wrapped in Nirvanic calmindifferent to the human swarm gigantic resistless moved onward inits appointed grooves
Through the welter of blood at the irrigationditch through the sham charity and shallow philanthropy of faminerelief committees the great harvest of Los Muertos rolled like aflood from the Sierras to the Himalayas to feed thousands of starvingscarecrows on the barren plains of India
Falseness dies injustice and oppression in the end of everythingfade and vanish away
Greed cruelty selfishness and inhumanity areshortlived the individual suffers but the race goes on
Annixterdies but in far distant corner of the world thousand lives aresaved
The larger view always and through all shams all wickednessesdiscovers the Truth that will in the end prevail and all thingssurely inevitably resistlessly work together for good
