By accountancy vve do not mean bookkeep ing For accountancy begins where bookkeeping leaves oiT
The skilled accountant takes the figures handed him by the bookkeeper and analyzes and interprets them
He knows how much the costs in the various departments should amount to how they may be lowered
He knows what profits should be expected from given enterprise how they may be increased
He knows in given business what per cent of ones working capital can safely be tied up in mer chandise on hand what per cent is safe and ade quate for sales promotion
And these by the way are but two of scores of percentagefigures where with he points the way to successful operation
He knows the intricacies of govern ment taxation
He knows how to survey the trans actions of business over given Mriod how to show in cold hard figures the progress it has made and where it is going
He knows how to use these findings as basis for con structive policies
In short the trained accountant is the controlling engineer of business one man business cannot do without
Small wonder that he commands salary two to ten times as great as that of the book keeper
Indeed as an independent operator head of his own ac counting firm he may earn as much as the president of the big and influential bank in his community or the operating man ager of great rail road

Modern Foremanship Personnel Manage ment Expert Bookkeeping Coaching Business English Stenotypy Effective Speaking Railway Accounting The Story Behind the Story OURTHDIMENSIONAL tales time traveling stories interplanetary yarns biological fantasies astronomical catastrophes what is the why for all these varieties of science fiction
We read an interplanetary novelette are fascinated by some of the stimulating ideas contained therein then sit back and admire the writers ingenuity
That vast percentage of the readers of THRILLING WONDER STORIES are vitally concerned regarding the origins backgrounds and themes of the stories they read has already been demonstrated con clusively by their numerous letters of ap probation since the inception of this de partment
Its an absorbing game going behind the scenes looking right over the authors shoulder at the halfstarted page in his typewriter
But heres word of warning
Dont anesthetize the effect of the stories by consulting the following letters prior to reading the works they tel
In several letters the authors tip their hands and what is intended to be surprise in the story is frankly discussed
So turn back here only after youve read the entire issue
UNIVERSAL DOOM UDGMENT SUN by EANDO BIND ER is mighty interesting story from its dramatic start to the surprising climax
Heres how Mr Binder explains the gen esis of his novelette The idea behind JUDGMENT SUN was one of those that strike suddenly
had been vacuously casting about for good plot but wanted to get away from the usual themes
How about something really appalling in the way of Earthly dooms but at the same time something close to the ground
It may have been my subconscious grilling that suddenly gave life to the idea of the sun falling down on Earth There was menace or terror that was personal one that each reader would feel menaced him
From there it was natural step to split the story into separate episodes to indicate how universal how far reaching the doom was
It was human interest theme and as such had to be developed from the angle of human emo tion rather than action
The jungle scene sug gested Itself immediately for what can shake mans guilt out of his secret soul quicker than the knowledge of doom and judgment
And so with the other scenes
Each was the choice out of dozens or hundreds of similar episodes that might he occurring anywhere on Earth during those tumultuous hours
The science of the story is frankly subordi nate to the human interest
It called for no more stretch of imagination than the usual doom story but had to be plausible for the sake of realism
For that reason the etherstrain explanation had to be complete but sketchy in order to take up as little space as possible
have always been of the opinion right or wrong that science fiction needs much more of human interest
With the influence that the late Weinbaum exercised on sciencefiction am glad to note definite trend toward the humanizing of its once so cold and lifeless characters
We need scientists that are not wooden puppets villains that are humanly yet viciously motivated heroes that go more by the heart than by the mind and menaces that hit us between the eyes
do not mean that we should stop exploring the immeasurable reaches of space or halt the progress of superscience or limit the boundless delving of imagination in our stories but do believe we at the other side of the editorial desk should not hesitate to have our characters act in accordance with human nature
Too often our hero follows psychology path laid out by framework of science and fails to be fundamentally human
At any rate the story of THE JUDGMENT SUN attempts to show the probable reaction of humanity to the panic of worlds end as charac terized by few chosen examples of ifs collec tive hordes
If it creates in the reader the slightest thrill of personal danger it has hit its mark
Otherwise it has missed it completely and ingloriously
FUTURE VARFARE UTHUR ZAGATS novelette THE FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE is plausible account of what might hap pen in future war between forces de pending mainly on scientific weapons for supremacy
Heres what Mr Zagat has to say regarding the development of his story The pattern of life does not change though the environment perhaps even the form of Man undergoes constant mutation
Through the ages the fundamentals of this thing we call living remain the same loyaltv and treachery selflessness and greed patriotism and treason selfseeking and selfsacrifice friendship and enmity love and hate adventure and desuetude
It was the conflict and inlerplay of these that furnished with the warp of his tales the earliest CroMagnon storyweaver crouching shaggy and brutefaced in the communal cave and dis pelling with the magic of his grunted mono syllabic speech the tribes shuddering dread of the sabretooth tiger whose roar beat out of the fearful dark against the portal boulder
They composed the lay of the silkribboned troubadour strumming his lyre In the castles highraftered hall while armored sentries paced the battlements
They furbish the pages of printed books and vibrate through the ether on the wings of modern miracle
Tomorrow who knows by what unthoughtof medium they will reach the brains and hearts and dreams of men
But always they were and are
and wiD be unaltered
Once upon time Attilas hordes swept ravening to the conquest of world
Once Alexander and Genghis Khan fought for uni versal empire
Once Napoleon closed fist knuckled with cannon upon all Europe
Today listen to the pound of the forge the roar of the furnace fires the hissing of chemists acids fashioning new weapons tor an old at tack
And tomorrow
Tomorrow it will be the same as yesterday
In the near future the wouldbe conqueror may come from some race newly reborn to lust for dominance

But come he will
And he will be fought with courage
With devotion and skill and ingenuity set against the might he deems overwhelming but always and ever with courage
When the fight is over won or lost some yarnspinner whose primal germ lies unguessed in your loins or mine or that of the elevator boy who just closed the gate in your anteroom will sing the saga of those newer heroes
To anticipate some narrator who lies curled in the womb of Things to Be to peer little behind the veil that screens That Which Is to Happen wrote FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE
That adventure will not occur to be sure
But some other adventure whose human fundamentals will be just the same is as cer tain to occur as that in this next instant will complete this sentence
MYSTERy MAN OF SPACE ANDERER OF THE VOID by Dr ARCH CARR the cover story for this issue carries surprise ending that were certain few readers will anticipate
Heres how Dr Carr planned his inter planetary short wanted to write story about space piracy and lone wolf crusader wdio for reasons knowm only to himself waged fierce and singlehanded warfare against these buccaneers of the skies
This crusader would be man of mystery of course his identity unknown on any planet
It would be necessary therefore to mask him for he must often come in contact with space patrolmen and others
The idea of making him metal man gov erned by an organic brain seemed good
But where was to get the human intelligence which must inhabit this brain
Then made use of an idea that had had in mind for some time that of liberating the human in telligence by subjecting the body to an electri cal wave whose frequency was the same as that of the body upon which it was directed
This too seemed good could take the in telligence from someone who had been victim ized by pirates and thus provide my crusader with his motive
The story was started and action precipitated by having the child become affected by har monic of the wave directed upon her father
And so it was in this manner that WANDERER OF THE VOID came to be written
DYING PLANET eil JONES fascinating novelette of Earths last stand and of Mans first space migration was written after some considerable attention had been de voted to the theme by the author
Jones did careful job on this as youll realize from reading this THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS explains itself
It is the conception of dying world with hu manity still persisting in spite of adversity
It is proved that planets have age that they be come old and uninhabitable
Their best ages of existence fade away
Wells The Time Machine afforded me much food for thought on the subject
It is extremely doubtful that mankind will carry on for five million years or million more years for that matter
Aa group he is Ilka the Jug that is carried to the well too often
There are too many things which may happen to him
Yet there still remains possibility that he may struggle onward for five million years
Regarding this possibility have pre sented but one viewpoint of what might hap pen what he might be like yet there is nothing too definite on which to base this assumption
Too many things can happen to change history environment and man himself
Mans evolution is guided largely by environment and his own initiative
It is scarcely to be taken for granted that the course of the worlds civilization shall be forward
There will be inevitable retrogression
Mankind will to all probabilities rie and fall change form and shape revert to degenerate savagery return again to civilized slate
Mankind is menaced with all forms of destruc tion including himself for Man is often Mans worst enemy
have drawn very conserva tive conception of the change wrought in Man after five million years for it is to Vie expected that he may assume an even more radical ap pearance than that suggested in the tale
Man long ago lost his tail and most of the hair which entirely covered his body
His appendix too is due to become passe
In time with the help of science he may come to sub sist entirely upon radiated energy this after having supplemented his digestive diet with more and more of the radiated energy until finally the digestive organs have become ex tinct
When Earth grows old
Man if he be sufficiently intelligent must find new world peculiarly adapted to him
It is most likely that during the rise and fall of humanity throughout the ages space flying will be re discovered and lost many times
There may even be visitors from beyond our own Solar Sstem
Mans occasional retrogressions to savagery and animalism will probably be swifter than his forward returns evolution following the line of least resistance
That he will become the food less and sleepless creature depicted in my story is but one of myriad possibilities for many things can happen to him in so long time
No one can with any certainty anticipate the farflung destiny of Man in the light of reason able consideration they may only conjecture
ATOMIC ADVENTURE ay CUMMINGS will always be fa mous for his stories of atomic explor ation Heres how the author of ELIXIR OF DOOM first conceived this theme Once was very earnest young bunessman
took subway ride
sat idly staring at the advertisements over the seats across from me
My attention focussed on an ad of the Quaker Oats Company
It showed the portly figure of Quaker gentleman in threecornered hat
He held in his hand box of oats on which was picture of the same gentleman holding similar package
And on that package could distinguish still smaller Quaker still holding another tiny package
stared spellbound
began to wonder if by going closer to the ad would see fourth smaller Quaker
And fifth
If had micro scope and the printing were mathematically perfect how many could see
An infinite numberl Quaker Oats down Into the infinity of smallness
went home seized pencil and paper
Thus my first atomic story The Girl in the Golden Atom was born
And it has served as in spiration for all my other science fiction
But was blissfully ignorant
In writing my first story violated every rule of plot con struction and handling
For instance called my hero the Very Young Man
When the story was in proof an irritated proofreader phoned me asking for name for the damned hero
him that didnt know except that he was the Very Young Man and would he please leave me alone because didnt want to be bothered

in Space
The Hot
mone Menace etc CHAPTER Worlds End HE earth was falling into the sun
There was no doubt about it
It was to be seen with ones own eyes
In the Western Hemisphere the people on the Atlantic coast saw swollen sun arise from the sea
Bloodred and distorted by uneven refraction it reared above the hori zon like giant eye of doom
It seemed to fishermen staring awe struck over the waters that this in credible sun that was four times larg er than usual hung for moment as though too heavy to rise
Or as though it were gathering strength for titanic effort to pursue its ageless course despite increased mass
There it hung for an instant
Then like cosmic bloated leech swelled by some nameless feast of celestial vampirism it shoved its ponderous unbelievable bulk above sea level
Bloodhued puffed like strained balloon insanely overgrown like malignant toadstool this monster sun loomed into the sky defiling its pure dainty blue
The fishermen had seen many and In the back of his mind each many sun swollen by refraction dur ing the dawn but never had they seen such huge orb spew from the eastern waves
And when the passage of an hour failed to reduce this awful phe Earth Faces Destruction and Only One person knew that the world was coming to an end nomenon and made it certain that it was to remain the fishermen franti cally hoisted sail
Their only thought was to flee from this ominous thing
Faces white beneath the saltspray tan they turned away and refused to look again at the hideous enlarged globe of fire
The leviathan sun flamed its way up into the heavens
It seemed to Man Dares to Match Wits with the Cosmos
THRILLING WONDER STORIES fuse the sky together so that it ran molten in streaks of ultramarine and glowing yellow
Beneath it the ocean seemed to lose its deep bluegreen and become crystal clear because of the piercing flood of rays from above
Then this stupendous sun as though Phaetondriven lifted itself ponderously for all the people of that part of the world to see and rising volume of fearful gasping cries seemed to swell upward from millions of throats
The sun
The sun was twice as wide as it should be
Its face was four times larger than nor mal
What in the name of all the gods was happening
The answer came to all to some in sidiously to others hammeringly to yet others explosively the sun is falling down on Earth
Or to the more scientificminded who were cor rect in little details Earth is falling into the sun
Einstein might have thought for an instant if any man could be so de tached in nature ah
chance to demonstrate the basic principle of relativity at one stroke to all the world
For whichever way you put it sun onto Earth or Earth into sun the end result was the same
Great catastrophes and holocausts of the past paled into utter insignifi cance beside this one
The great Chi cago fire the fouryear carnage of the World War even the legendary sink ing of Atlantis what were they com pared to this world doom
Stagger ing millions had been wiped out by the Black Plague of medieval times perhaps onethird of the existing population but here all all must die
There would be no younger genera tion to clean up and begin anew
This was that inconceivable thing death for all
The human mind no more than it can think upon its own personal death without an alarming unrest could not really grasp the thought of universal doom without going blank
Minds that did fully absorb the horrific thought those minds went mad
But in the majority of people temporary barrier of de lusionary amnesia kept them from realizing what it meant when their cracked lips spoke out the doom
One can imagine people walking around like shellshock victims muttering Everyone is going to die every one on Earth and then grinning foolishly at the absurdity
Yet in the back of his mind each person knew knew in such horribly positive way that all were going to die the whole world at once and as one
It ran like moan through the seared atmosphere Everyone is go ing to die Everyone is going to die
Everyone is going to die
Williams Bay Wisconsin group of scientists both profes sional and academic got together at eight oclock in the morning of that day of doom
Some had driven up from Chicago others had come by train and bus one had even flown up there to Yerkes Observatory instinc tively seeking out astronomical au thority
The answer must be here
Yet for all their hopes these men could not fail to notice that the air was tropically warm and the humidity almost insufferable
Even if Earth did stop its mad plunge sunward the in creased temperature would drive civ ilization toward the poles
At last murmur rose from the troubled crowd gathered at the towns small central park
huge car rolled up and several figures stepped out al most before it had come to stop
group of four made its way to the rostrum where on summer evenings the municipal band gave its concerts
The crowd quieted down as white haired portly Professor Hargreave second official of the Yerkes Observa tory nervously wiped his sweated face and confronted them
Gentlemen this is an honor Ridiculous words yet the crowd did not laugh or smile politely to it self
Momus himself god of laughter and merriment would have been pow erless to wring single chuckle from this grim dazed crowd
Professor Hargreave drew long breath and continued Well you all want to know what THE JUDGMENT SUN the official report on this this phe nomenon is murmur anxious assent came from the audience
Well it seems that is dammit all gentlemen we have no report
And dont know what you got me down here for in the first place
Did you expect that if we said the earth was not falling into the sun that the thing would promptly change back to nor mal
What do your own eyes tell you The crowd gasped and seemed to huddle together
About the only report could give you is something you all know any way
That the suns apparent diame ter is almost twice normal which means that it has approached within fifty million miles
It is too early yet to figure the rate at which Earth is moving he drev out the next word with an effort sunward but it must be at least at speed of one thousand miles per second
Unbelievable as it seems our planet is already as close to the sun as Mercury at its furthest aphelion
The lag in rising temperature which should result can be explained by our dense atmosphere which is acting as protective blanket
But when the atmosphere becomes saturated with heat He broke off as though the rest were too horrible and finished lame ly Vell thats all can say He turned away with gesture of dismissal
The crowd stirred but did not break up
It seemed reluctant to go away without some word of hope
But what word of hope could there be
ARGREAVE was about to step off the platform half angry at having been cajoled here to tell them that two plus two was four
Hardly anyone noticed the calmfaced tall young man who threaded his way to ward the rostrum and finally stepped on it
Just minute hundred pairs of eyes swung about in surprise stared at him curi ously
The young man raised his yoice as he went on Professor Hargreave and gentle men can tell you something about this phenomenon
can tell you for instance why Earth is falling into the sun You can tell us why Hargreave echoed and all the crovd echoed his words mentally
Yes The young man looked at them blandly
He seemed perfectly at ease
He paled little though as he sensed sudden murderous mood arising in the group
How did he dare to stand there calm and unafraid at time like this
His face became serious suddenly
can give you reason for this event he said earnestly
CHAPTER II Mans Fate SIMULTANEOUSLY thousands of miles away drama concern ing not millions of men but only two was being played in lonely isolation
The steaming furnace of the jungle had been around them for three days three sleepless grueling days
At last Cabel turned like an infuriated animal
His gross bearded face sweaty and haggardly lined vorked savagely
Damn you Robinson youre kill ing me he panted sucking in the hot miasmal air with straining lungs
No sleep for two nights just march march march
Im carrying both our packs and when want water you torture me with few drops
And these two bags of dust weigh ton
you cant wont go on The grin that came to young Burt Robinsons face was diabolic
tell you youre killing me screamed Cabel making desperate lunge
Burt sidestepped with short harsh laugh and pulled out pistol
It was Cabels own gun
Cabel growl ing slid to one knee
He made fu tile attempt to hunch the double pack off his aching tormented shoulders but Burts knots held as they had for three days
The younger man wiped his sweaty THRILLING WONDER STORIES hands on his shirt then took from his pocket folded piece of paper opened it up
In his clear script were the words confess to the murder of William Johnson with knife owned by Mayla our native guide and porter whom also murdered
Signed Ready to oblige rasped Burt waving the paper
Cabel looked up eyes like fevered coals between the matted hair hang ing down over his forehead
Never damn you
Im going to last this out Robinson see if dont
Ive had twenty years of jungle and its never beaten me yet
They dont come any tougher than me
Come on Cabel forced himself to rocking legs and staggered along the fern clogged trail
Burt put avay the pa per and followed
Immediately with their exertion the frightful heat clothed them in almost unendurable suffocation
Stabbing rays of the sun like mol ten bars of steel played constant tattoo on their clothing whichalready seemed on fire
Burt could not guess the temperature but he swore to him self it was the hottest day in history
But this torture of heat did not bother him as much as the fact that Cabel was bearing up miraculously load short water rations and all
Burt frowned
Before nightfall they would reach the river
If Cabel did not crack before then he might very well last it out
The row up the river would not be as much of grind as this jungle trek
Was Cabel to win out in this grim game
At camp three days before while Burt had been out hauling water from the spring Cabel had knifed Bill Johnson in the back and then had shot Mayla the Indian porter whose knife he had used
Burt Robinson had been saved by returning unex pectedly by way of the rock path sur prising Cabel and getting the drop on him
Burt had almost killed Cabel in rage seeing Johnsons agonized face
but he could not kill man even one like Cabel in cold blood
Thereupon he had decided to wring from him confession to insure his punishment by law up at Koniko
Cabel had sneered confidently
Then they had started on this journey into Inferno with Burt carrying the two guns and promising Cabel the worst fiveday hell he had ever imagined
Burt had no pity for the stumbling moaning man ahead of him
Pity for him
For three years he Cabel and Bill Johnson and faithful Mayla had worked their bonanza
Had sweated toiled laughed side by side
They had panned their dried well hidden creek bed for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in dust and small nuggets
Enough for all
hen Cabel greedridden had re vealed the cupidity he had held in check for those three years
He had planned the triple murder know ing story of attack by wild Indians backed by generous heap of dust would carry at Koniko
What incredible fortitude kept Cabel on his feet after this threeday eternity of hellfire
Even Burt un encumbered felt himself on the verge of sunstroke
And he was younger stronger than Cabel
The two men crossed an open patch of lushgrown ground and here the sun beat down with hammers of blind ing flame
Burt could not resist maddened urge to curse the fiery orb above
huge stinging drop of sweat touched one eyeball burning it so that he had to rub his eye clear but he looked again
And again raising his hand and peering through the fin gers
His lips made soundless ex clamation of amazement
Cabel was moving on doggedly head hanging
When they had crossed the clearing Burt called halt
Cabel threw himself pack and all on the sawgrass beside the trail panting like spent fox
His bloodshot eyes peered up mockingly from between the steaming tangle of his hair as Burt stood over him
Haul out our little paper sonny sneered Cabel so can spit at it THE JUDGMENT SUN He drew the flap of leather that was his tongue between his cracked lips Burt looked down at the murderer
Cabel he said sawing off the words you wont live to enjoy the fortune we made
Youre going to face your Maker with blood fresh on your hands Stow it croaked Cabel
You havent the spunk to kill me Cabel look at the sun The murderer peered upward to ward the sun
His first careless glance changed to wideeyed stare
An exclamation ripped from his heat lacerated lips
Good God
Whats the matter with the sun he gasped The heats got us it looks too big The heats going to get us you mean hissed Burt steamily
Cabel do you know what that means that we see
It means the Earth is falling into the sun
It must have been go ing on for hours maybe days but we didnt notice
Except that think youll agree this has been the hottest three days weve ever had even in this Devils sinkhole Cabels haggard face showed his abysmal fear
It cant be he mum bled swallowing with throat that had nothing to swallow
Maybe its mirage Whatever it is retorted Burt grimly thats going on between heaven and Earth Im not going to let up on you
Get going Burt driving the murderer along pitilessly saw at last chance to break him
Let his tortured mind la bor under the two burdens of secret murder and burning doom while the aching sweating physical grind tore his nerves to shreds
When the afternoon sun huge bloated orb reached its peak of hell ish intensity Cabel broke
Scream ing like madman he flung himself tremblingly under tree as if to hide from the pitiless sun
Its growing he babbled
saw it with my own eyes never heat like this before coming down on us Why did kill Johnson
Bbod he confession was signed
They went on with Burt carrying his own pack
Burt had given Cabel his fill of water
It was not till an hour later that Burt realized the murderer had cracked completely
He listened horrified as the broken man in front hissed Damn you sun you wont get me
Theyre going to hang me And Burt Robinson rowing grin ning vacanteyed Cabel up the river felt for the first time in full force the stunning realization of Earths doom
He had avenged the murder of his friend but to what avail
if you can believe me gentle men earnestly finished the young man in knickers
The crowd had not stirred since he first had begun to speak
Just who are you demanded Professor Hargreave
Well nobody confessed the young man with wry grin
That is my name isnt known except to my friends and relatives and the minister who baptized me
The name is Terry Blackwell
Im an amateur astrono mer use an eightinch refractor homemade mounting Thats neither here nor there Hargreaves puffy florid face was grim sweatbeaded
The thing is what proof have you for your ah quite harebrained explanation of this unprecedented phenomenon Proof Terry Blackwell frowned bit have proof of sorts
That is have series of photographs of the etherstrain in the past three months of its approach toward the sun Professor Hargreave looked at him sternly
And you didnt reveal this knowledge or theory at least of yours till this last fatal moment look of angry pain came into the young mans eyes
This morning at tried to get an audience at Yerkes he said slowly
was refused admittance
month ago wrote letter to Yerkes offering to show my photographs but the reply vas cold refusal signed by your self
It is not easy can assure you
THRILLING WONDER STORIES for an amateur to gain hearing The Yerkes astronomer flushed deeply
Hargreave remembered the letter vaguely and recalled too that he had chuckled over it
Strange how little things could turn up with the devastating force of hurricane in the sweep of tumultuous events
Well wel
see your photographs said Hargreave at last gruffly
Where are they At my home Geneva hours drive responded Terry
Perhaps wed better hurry Hurry yes agreed the astrono mer jerking himself up
Come my car CHAPTER III Stars in Their Courses YEAR before Robert McClaugh PhD had said believe my ten years of research are coming to head
Atomic power lies just ahead Six months before he had stated The power of the atom can be re leased by suitable concentration of cosmic rays One month before he had cried ex citedly Look Vogel my artificial cosmic rays already have the power to split the nitrogen atom week before he had spoken nerv ously Vogel dare not try it
Who knows but vhat the release of total energy in even thimbleful of gas might be the fuse to set the whole world aflame But what are you going to do Vogel had asked
Forget it for the time being Mc Claugh had muttered
Controlled atomic energy would be the worlds greatest blessing
But escaping it would be worlddestruction
Since dont know whether it is controllable with my ionized screen Ill have to work out sure method
There can be no halfcocked guesswork with this demonforce And McClaugh with Vogels assist ance had begun what might well be the task of years to find quencher that would as easily snuff atomic power as water puts out flame
Then something had occurred to put new face on the whole thing
Vogel had announced it with dazed expressionlessness
McClaugh had listened with detached curiosity
Come come man McClaugh scoffed at last
What are you trying to say that the earth is falling into the sun dont know how else Vogel said doggedly you can explain the sun being four times or more its usual size Why youre serious stated Mc Claugh
Then he dashed outside his laboratory home to see for himself
Everything was lit by an unnatural brightness this hot morning
People hurried here and there with fear on their faces
McClaugh put up his hand and squinted at the sun between his fingers
It was unmistakably larger sun than had ever shone on Earth in the history of man
What do you think sir Vogel asked when they went back inside
His lips trembled
He wiped perspi ration from his forehead
think its splendid retorted McClaugh vithout sarcasm
Vogel stared
But professor it means the doom of all Earth
Every one is going to die Exactly everyone is going to die The old scientist looked speculatively at his young assistant
Vogel do you think it would make much differ ence if everyone died few hours be forehand
Would you for instance care much if you died now or three days later if in both cases the deatn was inevitable Sir dont understand Fool barked McClaugh in quick temper
Naturally the quicker death is the more desirable
Death itself is not so terrifying the suspense of waiting for it is far worse
Isnt that so Yes sir
But we dont know for sure the earth will plunge all the way to the sun
It may stop somewhere and take up new orbit That we must find out Vogel
want you to call up all the newspaper offices and radio stations and ask for THE JUDGMENT SUN official reports if any His eyes held peculiar light
In the meantime He whirled on the motionless dazed Vogel
Well he roared
The young assistant ran like frightened rabbit
half hour later he sought the scientist and found him down in the basement workroom
Ive tried everywhere Vogel an nounced There have been no offi cial reports from anywhere
The newspaper offices have pleaded with Yerkes for statement but they re fuse as yet cCLAUGHS eyes still had peculiar glint in them
Do you know what that means Vogel
Their refusal to report means they fear the vorst
The earth is going to fall into the sun called my mother too mur mured Vogel biting his lip to hold back scream that pressed in his throat
She wants me to come home frightened guess
May go sir Yes of course of course The old scientists tone was preoccupied
He was busily engaged in examining the large electrical apparatus in the center of the room
Professor what did you mean while ago when you asked if would prefer er death now or later Nothing
Nothing at all hummed the aged scientist
He looked up fiercely as the assistant stood there
Well Vogel left with the echoes of that peremptory roar
As soon as the assistant left Mc Claugh ran to the door locked it
Then he gazed at the apparatus with eagerness
Here was the machine that could rend asunder mere puff of gas and extract from it untold power
But the proof of it lay in the trying and so far he had not dared try
He had not dared to increase the in tensity of his artificial cosmic ray beam to the point where it would not merely knock electrons loose from gas atoms but disrupt the nucfei themselves
In the nuclei lay the in conceivable hammer of atomic power
His cosmic rays were the hand that would wield that hammer
McClaughs heart began to pound madly an hour later when the appa ratus had been made quite ready
One twist of that red dial and Titan would leap from the machine
But would his screen of ionized mercury hold the vortex of potential force
Or would it burst free and McClaugh hesitated at the last min ute
His mind revolved again the train of thought that had brought him this far
Earth was doomed by an inexplicable fail toward the sun
If the vortex escaped and accom plished its progressive disintegration of the earth it would simply be quicker doom
But what if Earth was not doomed by the sun
McClaugh felt his mind whirling
The driving allconsuming urge of ten years of striving toward this goal gathered itself and rolled forward like juggernaut in his mind mowing down all other considera tions
Atomic power
Controlled atomic power or holocaust
The low powerful hum of the in ternal transformers seemed to beat time to his throbbing thoughts
Whitefaced dials seemed to stare at him like watching eyes
Watching this man who had fate in his hands
Power or destruction
Which would it be
McClaugh grasped the red dial with nervous hand
The die was cast
With savage finality he twist ed the rheostat control
He staggered back as tremendous shock rocked the floor
The whine of great power sang through the apparatus
Mc Claugh closed his eyes waiting for the microcosmic explosion that would destroy world
But the machine hummed steadily on
He ran to the dials face alight
They told their story the story of ten billion watts accumulated within the mercury chamber
And it had held
He had succeeded in produc ing controlled atomic power
The earth had legacy of endless costless power
THRILLING WONDER STORIES McClaugh grounded the mercury chamber dazed in his triumph and watched the dials show the slow out pouring of ten billion watts into the capacious bosom of Earth
IKHEN suddenly his face contorted JB horribly
His eyes swam in film of bloodtears
For in this moment of victory temporarily forgotten thought swept over him with crushing fury
Irony of ironies
He had given this great gift to world that would have no chance to use it
For the earth was plunging into the sun
Terry Blackwell shuffled through the pack of prints and finally picked out one
He handed it to Pro fessor Hargreave
Thats about the best took Terry said
It shows quite clearly the distortions of the star field es pecially around its edges Hargreave wiped rivulet of sweat from his cheek took the print eagerly
It showed small portion of the night sky with an appreciable dust ing of stars
Just below center was noticeable small patch in which the stars ran in curved streaks to form circle
Within that circle the star images were superimposed on one an other to form mottled design
The rest of these prints con tinued Terry show the three months progress of the etherstrain among the background of constellations as it slowly but surely approached the sun
did not know how close it was till one night it occulted Jupiter that is it threw Jupiters image about three minutes of arc out of place
Then knew it was comparatively close to Earth Hargreave and the officials with him looked over the prints carefully
One of the officials said finally Couldnt this be fault in the lens of your camera or in your telescope Strangely it was Hargreave who took Terrys part then
No because the distortion takes different posi tions in the print which could not be explained that way
Besides besides
seem to recall that several prints were ruined recently up at the Ob servatory by distortions exactly like these
We thought it was in the pho tographic paper and threw them away Thats right said one of the offi cials
remember that one print was ruined by fault in Scorpio about month ago June sixth to be exact confirmed Terry holding up the print for that date
If the group had had any seri ous doubts left they vanished utterl when this photograph showed the tail of Scorpio twisted out of place
Hargreave looked at Terry with something of deep respect
Young man he said excitedly think there isnt any doubt about it any more
In credible as it seems your etherstrain theory must be right
It plunged into the solar system or rather the solar system met up with it and as re sult They all knev the result great menacing sun that had apparently burst its linear bonds and become threat of doom over world of crea tures who were in the last analysis less bound by the laws of man than the laws of nature
Before blanket of censorship had muffed the blarings of radio commen tators an hour before there had been stark reports of rioting hundreds suicidal thousands hysterical millions in Europe which had already viewed the Brobdingnagian sun for twelve hours
What was happening in America the Lord only knew
THE JUDGMENT SUN Hargreave glanced at his watch
It was ten oclock
Wiping off the sweat sprinkled over his boiledlooking skin with limp and already saturated handkerchief he gasped Telephone
Quickly CHAPTER IV Sunrise UTWARDLY Jose Estaban was calm and proud with his back against the high stone wall of the prison courtyard
If there were any mental worms gnawing at his brain it did not show on his saturnine face with its mocking smile
He had been that way the night before during the hasty military trial
The solemn dark faces of the enemy had filled with hate as they turned to him
There had been the forma
recital of his many acts of espionage
Then the faces had turned to triumphant glee as the headofficer pronounced the sentence in cold harsh tones Jose Estaban known as El Disblo Espia your crimes against the nation of Bolivia merit death
Fucilado la solida del sol you will be shot at sunrise Jose Estaban looked up and saw the rosy fingers of approaching dawn tremble through the gloom
The ten men of the guard at an order from their captain made right turn on their heels and marched toward the farther wall against which lay ten rifles
Jose stared stolidly ahead
El capi tan stalked up
Blindfold senor He tendered black cloth
Jose smiled the saturnine smile that had won him the name of the Devil Spy
Save it mi Capitan he murmured softly for mourning when el Chaco Boreal the land for which we fight passes into the hands of Paraguay Brave words for dead man leered the captain
He whirled and valked to position beside the ten riflemen
As he glanced impatiently out the east gate for the soontorise sun his lieutenant spoke in his ear Would it not be best mi Capitan to have the men fire right now even though the sun has not yet risen lest he escape in some way The puerco will not escape Five times before was he captured and five times he escaped reminded the underofficer
He rolled his eyes superstitiously
They say the devil himself watches over this man
Look how he grins as he stands there as though he expects not to die but to have the laugh over us
The men are nervous too and Silence perro hissed the Boliv ian Captain
There is no miracle can save him
We will wait for punc tual sun to give the signal of his death But as the slow minutes passed in ominous silence with the flush of nearsunrise growing in strength even the toughsouled captain became nervous
The men fidgeted shuffled their feet
The lieutenant stood with mouth half open as if prepared at any mo ment to see the devil himself arrive and whisk his protege away
For el Diablo Espia had been almost myth for two years one whose activities had been devilishly cunning
In the gloom the spys eyes seemed to gleam like small fires
His lips were curled in mockery
Suddenly his eyes flicked to the eastgate and widened slightly
For there he saw girl white arms straining to tear down the solid bars of steel
At the same time the tip of the sun peeped over the horizon and shaft of brightness speared into the shadowy courtyard
El capitan awaiting this signal raised an arm
The riflemen brought up their guns took aim
scream in tercepted the word fucil The Bolivian captain glanced to ward the gate saw the girl and mo tioned for the men to lower their rifles
El capitan was of the old school with chivalry deeply imbedded in his nature
He strode toward the girl at the eastgate
Senorita beg of you to depart for the time
It is no pretty sight THRILLING WONDER STORIES this
Particularly for so charming girl ARK eyes aflame the girl spoke tremulously Mi Capitan please do not kill this man
Make him prisoner instead till the war is over Catamba
Are you mad
He is our nations worst enemy Then let me go to him die with him pleaded the girl wildly
love him sheltered him for many days before he was captured so am traitor to Bolivia
Do you hear
You must kill me with him because am traitor Diablo
That is impossible sen orita
will not believe it
More it is foolishness
You cannot die with him Then let me be with him for tiny moment
will do anything any thing if you will grant me that The stern look on the Bolivians face dissolved to reflection
You love this man si
You will do anything to be with him for moment si
You will perhaps let me do all in my power to comfort you afterward
Comprendo lovely one Soft black eyes tragic the girl nodded
Let me in to him and you will not regret it Grinning in satisfaction the cap tain called for one of his men to open the steel gate
But one minute will give you he admonished the girl
Like bird seeking its nest the girl ran to Jose enfolded him in trembling arms
The doomed man lifted up her face kissed her tenderly
In some after life we will be reunited Nina
Our love cannot die They clung to one another fiercely for moment then Jose pushed her away firmly
But go now
Death awaits me mi dies
Then with you die The girl flung herself about faced the firing squad with her body in front of his
At the other side of the courtyard the men watching this scene ex changed glances
The Devil Spys doom was being delayed as if death itself were reluctant to take him
flood of rays from the east gate now lit up the tableau with supernal brightness
The girls white clothes seemed to expand into blazing cloak that hid the man behind
El capitan cursed and started forward
When he had gone half way dark streak plunged toward the east gate
It was el Diablo Espia making run for the steel portal that had been care lessly left unlocked after the entrance of the girl
Shoot him kill him screamed the Bolivian captain frantically jerk ing out his own pistol
The distance vas hundred feet
Of the ten men tnat brought up their rifles one must surely have aimed true
But only one bullet was fired that of el capitan and it failed to stop the flying man even though it made trail of spattered blood over the grey cobblestones
The rest of the men stood staring toward the eastgate watched el Dia blo Espia escape from it
It was not him they watched however
It was the incredible thing beyond
heir widening dazed eyes be held the enormous bulk of an en chanted sun now hanging just over the horizon
It was the color of the droplets of blood that marked the es caped spys trail
Misshapen by re fraction it floated there like the Gar gantuan heart of some celestial Cy clops
Cloud wisps scurrying by made it seem to pulsate with nameless life
It was wizards trick and the Bo livian riflemen as they reeled back in fright had no doubt that it was the doing of the devil himself to insure the escape of his ward the Devil Spy
Professor Hargreave slammed down the receiver in disgust
Cant get Washington for love or money he said explosively
suppose every crank and fool in the country is on the wire
Talk about voice crying in the wilderness He jumped to his feet
But some thing has to be done
You Bradley take my car and get to Milwaukee as fast as you can
Get general mes THE JUDGMENT SUN sage over the radio if you have to buy out station
We cant let any thing stop us
Kincaid you take plane for Washington and get to somebody high up if you have to mur der to do it
In the meantime Ill try to get call on the phone through so one of the three of us ought to get our message across
Get going men The tvro men dashed out faces set in determination
Hargreave turned immediately to the telephone barking into it viciously
When long distance had completed his connection he rapped Dr
Morris Birge Director of Biology hurry Over his shoulder he said half mumblingly to Terry Hes government man
Agricul tural Bureau
Connections in what For moment he listened then hung up slowly
His eyes were pained as he turned to Terry
Suicide he muttered dazedly
An hour ago swallowed dose of curare
My friend
One night he con fided in me that his wild passionate youth weighed heavily on his mind
But for him to The astronomers eyes changed sud denly
He grabbed up the phone again hopefully
few minutes later he jumped to his feet with curse
Velter dead too he groaned
Shot this morning during jailbreak at Joliet prison
He was Gman hot on the trail of somebody down there
Now hes gone too
dont know who to try next for contact at the White House
But must have it Maybe can help cried Terry
He continued at Hargreaves gruff Well Wisconsins Senator Jordan has summer home here in Geneva
Just down the street
If hes home Come on shouted Hargreave pushing his twohundredpound bulk toward the door at an actual run
They went out into the hot afternoon
Since dawn the overgrown sun had increased its girth by another diam eter
It was now nine times as large in face area as normally
The heat teemed insufferable
Thats the house there pointed Terry and moment later they were panting up the steps of broad shaded verandah
Pray God hes here exclaimed Hargreave fervently
CHAPTER Cosmic Laughter HE God of Irony looked down on Earth that day and laughed
He saw world of creatures disturbed from their normal pursuit of life and it was funny to watch their painful antics
In New York drunk who had made his usual nightly rounds saw the dawn of an impossible sun and laughed himself to sleep on some bodys doorstep in the thought that pink elephants and snakes were passe
Near Chicago two gangsters re turning from ride with blood fresh on their hands stared amazedly su perstitiously at the bloodred Titan sun and ran headon into milk truck dying instantly
The God of Irony laughed louder
young man up all night in his shabby rentdue room bitterly con vinced that life was not worth living if one could not work and eat with drew the fatal blade from near his throat at the sound of outside shout ing that came with the dawn and when learning of the sundoom cursed the fate that was inevitably going to end his life while he was so young
After three days and nights of un selfish sleepless labor their rescue tunnel reached the cavein and they brought up the buried miner in the dawn of that fateful day and his tears of joy and relief changed into raging curse when he learned that he had escaped one doom only to be in time for another
An early bird evangelist harangu ing gullible audience gleefully launched into his pet theme of hellfire and brimstone from which there was no escape except through becoming the soul of purity and repentance tha he was but one could never describe THRILLING WONDER STORIES the strange green color of his apo plectic face when the sundoom be came manifest
patient earnest astronomer gave shout of joy to the amazement of his colleague who had just announced the news of Earth falling intothesun and exulted Now Ill get superlative photographs of the sunspots perhaps solve their mystery Brushing back his long hair the starving poet again invaded the offices of the News
This time the weary editor accepted some of his work thinking Any junk will do for filler to day And at the same time that the poet inwardly exulted Perhaps at long last they see what am trying to say
Maybe this is beginning for me The God of Irony was now doubled up with uncontrollable mirth
prima donna threw back her head and sang to the small musicthirsty audience sang as never before sang in the face of certain doom glorious ly triumphantly with magnificent defiance strangely free of the haunt ing fear that her voice was failing
For the first time in months years she was giving performance of real brilliance performance that was to go down into oblivion
Destined to produce masterpiece an author scribbled away madly all day in his locked room unaware of the doom that threatened to make his production worthless
the janitor awoke with great joy in his heart for the day before he had cashed in his sweepstakes ticket and today he would begin spending it in glori ous abandonment but an hour later little lights of madness came into his eyes as the overbrilliant sunlight shone on fistful of green papers with numbers on them

He rubbed his eyes looked again then turned dazedly to his visitors
The earth is falling into the sun The earth is falling into the sun of course said Hargreave impa tiently perhaps little sneeringy at the senators helplessness he who could harangue election crowds for hours over nothing at all

What Im here for is telephone connection with the White House
In fact with the President himself or Secretary of War or somebody in high authority

But there were those many who sadistically set about displaying their twisted mental complexes

Its actual effect was more mental than anything for neither the in creased heat or light could account for what went on

SnterMolecular Life Threatens to Subjugate Earth IN MENACE FROM THE MICROCOSM Complete Novelette of Worlds within Worlds By JOHN RUSSELL FEARN In the NeV Issue oF THRILLING WONDER STORIES spread the word that Earth could not be nearer the sun but to no avail
By mad coincidence that fateful day had been one of the hottest of the year
The imagination of mans mind had swelled the temperature to unreasoning heights
Seeing is be lieving never before had that plati tude been demonstrated with more ir resistible force
Observatories in Asia vhich conti nent had first seen the phenonienon detail they had all failed in their mes sage to Earths unreasoning multi tudes
Not one of them had thought to give reason for the illusion
Terry Blackwells explanation owed its sudden universal acceptance to the fact that it accounted for the illusion as well as named it such
Terry Blackwell found himself world figure by midnight
Saved from further terror relieved of black heartchilling despair the population THRILLING WONDER STORIES demanded hero of worship for the soothing message of peace
He tried to escape it but at midnight found himself standing before microphone on worldwide hookup
What shall say
gulped Terry nervously
Professor Hargreave smiled indul gently
It doesnt matter much what you say
You could say boopboopa doop and they would take it for pearly wisdom
But you may as well give the world resume of your whole theory just about as you gave it up at Yerkes this morning But the theory is wild guesswork pleaded Terry
It happens to ac count for the illusion by luck per haps
Im not real scientist at all
If youre not real scientist Id like to meet one said Hargreave
He signaled to the commentator
The latter who had been frantically wav ing for them to approach the micro phone and had been filling the time with the usual playup sighed in re lief
People of Earth he concluded realizing the tremendousness of the occasion in that phrase People of Earth give you now Mr Terry Blackwell the young man who this day proved the great illusion ffW ADIES and gentlemen it was about three months ago Terry began that photographed Saturn with my eightinch refractor telescope
The print showed small faint distortion in one corner
The next night tried again and found an identical fault in the photograph
From then on with more luck than skill succeeded in trailing the almost unnoticeable distortion photo graphically as it moved across the stars
It was quite invisible by visual observation
followed it with pho tography for those three months and unmistakably it grew larger and more pronounced
One evening it cama abreast of Jupiter magnified it and threw it out of line as well as the immediate field of stars
That indicated that this giysterious enigma was close to us already between Earth and Jupiter
Not having the necessary mathe matical skill to plot its course had no idea it would eventually come be tween Earth and sun
But it did and in doing so caused the enlargement of the sun we have observed
About week ago started seri ously thinking of an explanation for it
What strange thing at least the size of the sun transparent but high ly refractive could be drifting through space
Since it was com pletely uncatalogued in modern sci ence had clear field in which to speculate
As result Ive worked out theory for it which later scien tific research may modify but it is this Somewhere and sometime in the cosmos dense and dark star like the companion of Sirius collided with an other large star and vas knocked out of its normal orbit in the universe or fused with it to become nova
This dead star must have been incredibly dense perhaps half composed of neu tronium which weighs sixty million tons to the cubic inch
And its gravi tational field must have been immeas ureably stronger than any we know
So strong in fact Terry drew long breath and con tinued for he knew that hundreds of astronomers and other scientists would be listening So strong in fact that the warp it produced in space became perma nent
Thus when the dead star itself was knocked away the etherstrain it had made went on in the old orbit
Like the shell of nut continuing to exist long after the kernel which grevy it has been eaten awav by worms
The collision itself may have hap pened untold trillions of years ago and perhaps in some other galaxy
But the etherstrain pursued its lone course unaffected by the laws that govern the rest of the universe and came finally to our galaxy and our Solar System
By deduction from its low ve locity it must have entered the Solar System within the orbit of Pluto about five years ago
But it would THE JUDGMENT SUN have been impossible to detect it then for even so bright an object as the sun looks merely like star from Plutos distance
And this etherstrain is ab solutely invisible
It was not detectable till it had approached quite near within one half billfbn miles and then only as faint smudge on sensitive photo graphic plate
So it may be said that the etherstrain sneaked up on us like an invisible snake
count it only as great good luck that happened to catch it on my plate since it only took up about one millionth of the total sky area
After entering the Solar System and because its velocity relative to the sun was just little more than Earths orbital velocity it contrived to hang in between Earth and sun for these many hours
Its huge area is very gradually drawing ahead of the Earth and will in few hours un doubtedly clear away
There is only one thing left to mention and explain the way it mag nified the suns image
The effect of such magnification will be under stood if it is compared to telescope lens with high refractive index but very long focus
Like giant hand glass this sphere of warped space hung between the direct rays of the sun and Earth and bent the light rays to focus for Earthly eyes
The etherstrain has the ability to bend light in accordance with Ein steins laws but in greater degree than ever observed before because its warp of space is greater than we have ever known
Paradoxically this warp does not have any gravitational influ ence as it should have for Einstein says the force of gravity is simply curvature of space
This can be ex plained by assuming that when space has been abnormally warped its gravi tational effects link into closed circle no longer able to exert exter nal influence
And so concluded Terry this extremely startling phenomenon in our skies today has been merely an optical illusion Hargreave had moment before he received paper from the announcer
He stepped before the microphone as Terry backed away

The MIDGE Thrice in the Annals of Man the Human Race is Faced with Extinction
INVINCIBLE By PAUL ERNST Microscopic Giants Dives Deep etc
Death Author or Links in the chain of humanity he sentinels of the tree people crouched in the highest branches of their communal dwelling place and stared fearfully toward the west
Beneath them the activities of the tree village were stilled
Men women and children crouched on quivering haunches each near tree bole up which quick ascent could be made if necessary
The strings of tough vines crudely fastened from tree to tree making sort of rough platform thirty feet above the teeming ground were empty
The hairy mighty thewed folk crouched and stared as the sentinels in the treetops above did toward the west
There where the whitehot sun was dying was the danger source
From there death came death on two colos sal hind legs towering as high as tree itself
When the hairy tree people built their aerial village thirty feet above the deathinfested ground they had hoped to know new safety
For while they had
The sabertoothed tiger the monstrous serpent the great THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE bear were baffled by that height
They could be beaten off by stone ax and club before they reached it
But this new menace which threat ened the very race made mockery of their sanctuary
In the highest branch of the conifer tree in the center of the aerial vil lage crouched Taljuck the Quick
Near him was the gorillalike form of Ank strongest man of the tribe Anks thick lips moved and gut tural chattering sounds were articu lated through his heavy protruding jaws
It was not language it was series of symbolic sounds painting simple pictures of the mind
You think the Great One will come on this sundeath Taljuck grunted
His jaws were not quite so bestial as those of the other hairy folk
His forehead was little higher
his eyes little clearer
His enormous hairy hands tightened on the odd contrivance he had made during the last four days
Who can say
Sometimes the Great One comes sometimes it does not
But when it does come it is al ways at this hour Anks muddy brutish eyes went to the queer invention in Taljucks hands
You are going to try that on the Great One Yes
If it comes ALUCK looked at the new weapon born of his brain
Fierce pride was in his eyes
It was tough curved length of wood nearly four inches through
From end to end of this was tiger tendon scraped as thick as his little finger
long straight stick with sharp stone was tied to one end
Taljuck placed the blunt end of the stick on the tendon stretched the heavier stick in great arc then re laxed it
The bow and arrow had been born of Taljucks brain though its birth was not to be credited for thousands of centuries and through it Taljucks tribe was to reign su preme for the lives of ten thousand succeeding generations
This cannot kill so great beast at once
But it can pass through the throat and later the thing will die You can send that stick through the Great Ones throat echoed Ank
Taljuck fingered the pointed stone at the end of the crude arrow
Eons later men were to find that and think it peculiarly shaped axhead not realizing the enormous muscles of the men that could use it as an arrow head
It will pierce the fhroat
know what it can do scream arose from below
It came from the downy lips of young girl Sor the FarSeeing
It comes
It comes
see the Great Ones head The tree people rushed here and there chattering like great apes
One child fell the hairy mother swung monkeylike to the ground caught up her offspring clambered to the heights again
To the heights that did not protect against so huge thing as the Great One
The sentinels biggest and strongest men of the tree folk grunted ex citedly to one another
All but Tal juck
Taljuck was silent bracing himself in the treefork with hairy legs while his great hands flexed and loosed the bow and arrow first of Mans great inventions
In the semicircle made by the white sun sinking over the horizon head appeared
It was reptilian head colossal its gaping jaws studded with huge teeth
short vast throat appeared then the rest of the body
The body was mountain of lizard flesh and bone carried on two incon ceivably enormous legs with great tail to help its blundering balance
It hitched over the ground crushing young trees making the steamy earth tremble
And as it neared the tree village it reared higher so that its incredible head was above the level of the hairy peoples sanctuary
The Great One they called it
Long long later it was to be named from its remains
Tyrannosaurus rex the most ferocious animal ever known
This was an anachronism perhaps the last of its kind on Earth freak sur THRILLING WONDER STORIES vivor species supposed to have died out miliions of years before the appearance of the hairy folk
But the tree people did not know that
All they knew was that sud denly moons ago this enormous thing had appeared over the skyline at sunset stalked to their village and taken five of their number as tall man might pluck five green gourds in high tree and gulp them down
Since then the Great One had come at irregular intervals and always four to seven of their number went down that tremendous maw
Bowing to the Great One and wor shiping it giving it sacrifices volun tarily had not placated it
The tribe was in danger of extinction unless Taljucks two sticks could somehow save it
To the highest branches scuttled the tree folk there to cling like furred fruit
But the highest branches were not high enough
The trees mighty of girth were not lofty
roaring whoosh of air was expelled from the Great Ones throat and its basilisk eyes fastened on Sor the FarSeeing
CREAM after scream ripped from her lips
Her face just becom ing downy with the fine hairs of adolescence was the color of lizards belly
The other tree folk chattered and moaned
Taljuck bent the great bow
The Great Ones jaws gaped as it lumbered toward the tree in which Sor clung paralyzed
Vine catwalks were swept away like thread by the monsters bulk
There was last shriek dry clashing of teeth Taljuck
Strike Ank grunted in anguish
In the hands of Taljuck the Quick the big bow quivered at its full arc
But the Great One was yards from his perch
He did not yet send the long stick with the sharp stone on it sing ing forth as he had learned to do in the days before
The tyrannosaurus as though drawn ay Taljucks appalled but steady eyes turned toward his tree
It lumbered there
Ank chattered and shriesed in ihe tree beside him
Strike But still with steady eyes Taljuck held the arrow taut on the tiger ten don
The Great One crashed within ten yards
Shrilling despairing cries Ank loosed his hold and fell plummetlike to earth risking death by the fall rather than face the monster longer
He moaned and grunted on the ground with both legs broken so tne bone pro truded through the hairy flesh which meant lingering instead of quick death
And Taljuck with grunt released his stonetipped stick
With thin shriek the arrow cleaved the air
The sharp stone hit the leatherarmored throat of the Great One and went on in
The arrow driven by force such as is unknown to any muscular framework of man today buried itself almost to its blunt end in the lizards flesh
The monster stopped its rush
Its short front legs went up and its claws raked at the thing that stuck out like splinter from its streaming neck
Then with an earsplitting scream of air from its cavernous body it came on toward Taljuck
Taljuck clung to his treefork as paralyzed as Sor had been
The Great One was not at all harmed by the arrow it seemed
Dimly its low ordered nervous system informed its tiny brain that it had been hurt but its vast strength was unimpaired
It got to Taljucks tree lunged against it reached for the hairy human midge with gaping jaws
Tai juck the Quick stared at the gaping maw which was streaming gouts of red from the transfixing arrow
The great bow dropped from his nerveless hands
From other high points the tree folk screamed and chattered and moaned
The branch on which Taljuck had been was empty
It quivered still with the force of clutching hands that had been torn from it and that was all
Taljuck the Quick first inventor was pulp in the toothstudded mouth
But what was this
The Great One though only two odi es had gone into its cavern THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE mouth was not crashing after more
It stood motionless beside the tree in which Taljuck had clung
Its ex pressionless eyes looked toward the west not toward extra victims
thundering bubbling airrush came from its transfixed throat
Blood and hairy fragments that it could not swallow geysered from its maw
It lurched slowly away from the aerial village
For long moment the hairy people watched it go unable to understand
Then the first timid shout of deliver ance keened out to grow to chatter ing grunting chorus
The Great One was being driven away
Taljucks stonetipped stick had beaten it
Three days later the tribe feasted on the mound of flesh that lay off to ward the west
Ordinarily no death of man was remembered for three days individually in the dim minds of these folk
But they remembered Taljucks because he had saved the tribe
They feasted in Taljucks name and the men of the village fashioned long sticks to bend like his and send stonetipped lances into the flesh of other animals
Taljuck the Quick was dead but the tribe lived on saved by the living fruit of his brain
rom their mountain observa tories all over the world the astronomers peered up the magnify ing channels of their threehundred and threehundredandfiftyinch tele scopes
In the teeming cities around them activities were stilled
Men women and children stood hushed in the streets and they stared as the astronomers did up into the sky
For every mans fearful eye and every mans appalled thoughts in the year were on the same object
The moon
From that heavenly ball hanging balloonlike now in the cloudless sky it seemed that the death of the human race was coming
For the moon was dying and in its extinction it promised to upheave Earth so that no tiny human mite perhaps no life at all would be left on its surface
The human race had thought itself in position to live tranquil and un troubled existence on Earth forever
It had outlawed the horrible wars that had nearly decimated civilization sev eral centuries ago
It had solved the food problem producing sustenance for Earth billions with only few hours of work day for each indi vidual
It had prolonged the span of life to an average of hundred and ten years
Man was firmly enthroned he had thought
And for time this had been true
But now this cataclysmic menace from the heavens threatened the en tire human race
In the Mount Everest observatory
Professor Talmadge turned from the eyepiece of the telescope which was so powerful that it would have re vealed man walking on the moons surface had there been one there to walk
He stared at his assistant Tohiki
Its the end he said
The moon is falling toward Earth at rapidly accelerating rate Tohiki nodded dark slanting eyes shining with sad intelligence Even if it fell no further he said it would be the eventual end Both were silent thinking of the catastrophes that had begun at once with the moons inexplicable subsi dence back toward the planet from which it had been torn million mil lion years ago
All over the world earthquakes of unbelievable violence had destroyed cities drained great lakes created new ones changing Earths map at the incidental cost of millions of lives
All over the world volcanic erup tions had burst forth on terrifying scale
Active volcanoes had belched more molten rock in year than in all their recorded history before
Old volcanoes became alive again
New ones formed in the most unlikely places one ten miles across its jagged new crater spouted through ancient rock in the Alleghanies THRILLING WONDER STORIES obliterating all human life as far north as New York and as far south as Washington
But the worst of the disasters were the floods ever increasing in height and severity
At each high tide the water of the seven seas rolled to new heights pulled by the increasing drag of the moon
Daily tidal waves mounted with their roaring crests loftier than they had been the day before
coastal cities of any nation were in existence any longer few twisted metal stubs showed where tall buildings had been
few weed wracked lines of broken stone indi cated streets when they could be seen at all under lowtide depths
All human beings save those millions who had been engulfed by the encroaching sea had long since fled to the inland mountains
And still the moon comes closer murmured the Japanese
Still it comes closer nodded Tal madge
And it will continue to ap proach
It will reach the point where the ocean tides rage over the whole face of the Earth daily
They will submerge all land even this great crest
Nothing but marine life will endure
In fact even that may perish for at this point the moon will prob ably burst and surround Earth with belt of million tiny moons that will blanket us from the sun so that our planet freezes Tohikis intelligent eyes went to small drawing hung on the observa tory wall
That may save us he said
Talmadge shrugged
There is perhaps one chance in ten that choice few of Earths people may survive the coming disasters in the Talmadge Retreat
If anything can save us that can The astronomer who was that rare scholar man of general accomplish ments in varied fields of science walked to the drawing and studied it with proud yet faultfinding eyes
Read in scale the drawing showed cavern ten miles across with rounded roof quarter of mile high which was supported by rows of en ormous metal pillars
The cavern was in the base of mountain indicated by dotted lines The outline of the dotted lines was that of Everest it self showing that the depicted cavern must be under the feet of the two men
Shall we call the elected few to night said Tohiki
Talmadge bit his lips
His eyes far seeing and keen narrowed
Then he nodded
We know what is to happen so shortly
There is no reason for delay
And Tohiki only two thousand people the best of every walk of life understand said Tohiki
Death was in his eyes as it was in the eyes of Talmadge
But the coming cata clysm was too great for anything but utter desperate calmness
Particular ly you want engineers that can handle the atomdisrupter Yes
That by all means replied Talmadge
Tohiki left the observation chamber
Talmadge went over in his mind for the thousandth time the one thing that made oarely possible the preser vation of human life on Earth
The Talmadge Retreat
No it vas not that
Anyone can excavate great cave at mountains base
It is another matter to feed and clothe two thou sand people in it and give them air to breathe over centuries of time
This Talmadge hoped to do with his atom disrupter
It was the last great invention of mankind one which by its very sim plicity had baffled science for cen turies
All matter is similar in that it is made from the same building blocks
One substance is made different from another only in that its atoms have varying numbers of protons and elec trons
It had been known for long time that if atoms could be disin tegrated to their component parts and the parts rearranged any desired element could be produced from the elemental debris
Furthermore any substance could be contrived synthet ically by controlled molecular ar rangement
THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE Starkly ferociously simple this fact
And with stark ferocious sim plicity Talmadge had solved the equation
He disrupted atoms with heat
But such heat
Three million de grees Centigrade produced for few millionths of second by electrical discharge through high tension vacuum tubes
It could not be kept up longer for fear of burning out the apparatus but those few millionths of second were enough to strip atoms
HE readdition of electrons to produce any given element
Ah that had been more difficult
But Tal madge had solved it in experiments no less sublime for being empirical he had discovered that different de grees of heat produced different ele ments and had the differences tabu lated
Thus by variation of few hundred thousand degrees he could take stripped atoms and give you what you liked from hydrogen to uranium
From then on it was mere matter of synthesis to produce anything from the air you breathed to the food you ate out of rock metallic ores or any thing else at hand
There were slight variations between the synthetic and the real products Talmadges oxygen for example had an atomic weight of instead of but these differences had no practical results
Thus with the socalled atom disrupter Talmadge proposed to keep two thousand human beings existing for indefinite centuries in cave under the base of Everest until such time as the planet returned to some thing like normality after the moons disruption once more allowing life on its surface
Talmadge sighed
He thought his mighty invention was perfected
If it was the human race had slight chance of survival
If it was not Soberly he looked around the ob servatory for the last time absently patted the magnesium rim of the tremendous telescope reflector plate
Then he went out into the sparkling cold air of Everests crest and stepped onto the slowspeed strip of the end less escalator which in its highspeed outer edge took him toward the mountains base at forty miles an hour
Within ten hours all were assem bled in the great cavern in the bowels of the mountain
There were men and women of the highest standing in all branches of science
There were men and women picked because of eugenic physical factors to keep up the body stamina of the race
There were few old men chosen for their exten sive learning but in the main it was young crowd
Talmadge knew well how necessary for blind race survival was sound physique
The cave in which these people were to live and their descendants after them for unimaginable cen turies was ready
In the center domed building rose that was the heart of the place
Dovn from that went shaft halfway to the core of the Earth
Up this shaft came Earths internal and eternal beat to be transmuted into plentiful power
Around the shafthead were the bank rows of atomdisrupters where all necessities of life were to be manufactured
Tinned food enough for thirty years was in stock before the two thousand would have to begin existing on synthetic food pellets
The entrance into the cavern was milelong tunnel from outer air at the base of Everest
This had been blocked up against the future mighty tides by solid seal of liquescent rock which hardened into substance like gneiss
Through the center of the milelong seal however had been left oneinch hole
Dovn this were lenses in sequence terminating in fisheye lens that spread vision
simple peephole arranged because the atmospheric disturbances caused by the moons approach made tele vision impossible
Talmadge addressed the shivering throng in the cavern
Comrades Earth as you know is about to pass into an epoch more violent than any it has suffered since THRILLING WONDER STORIES it cooled enough for life to begin
During this violence we and our descendants hope to exist in here through flood and fire through the moons bursting and blanketing of Earth through the ensuing glacial period
Mankinds nucleus may struggle up to reborn world from this cave thousand years from now million perhaps never
But mean while we shall keep the spark of the race alive hope That was all and even that was superfluous
All knew why they were here and what faced them
The calm of catastrophe beyond mortal imagina tion to visualize held them
Talmadge turned to the peephole
It was all very bewildering and in credible
There was no explanation for the suddenness with which it hap pened
All scientists had agreed that the mounting tides would rise gradu ally little higher each day until at last all Earth would be daily deluged
And all scientists were wrong
Talmadge inventor of the atom disrupter turned to that peephole to see for one thunderous instant thing which was impossible but which was nevertheless occurring
Instead of increasing in height gradually the moondragged tide had leaped within few hours to within half mile of what should be its eventual maximum
He had thought to see dry vista from the mountains base had thought it would be weeks before the high plateau would feel its first ripples from the distant ocean
Instead Tal madge looked through the rock seal to see something that at first he thought was great mountain chain newly formed about quarter of mile from the fisheye lens
Then he saw that the mountain chain was composed of water was the first really great tidal wave
sort of moan left his lips
Mile high in spite of the altitude to which it had already climbed to reach here the wall of water rushed toward Everest
Talmadges stunned eye saw great crests toppling from its highest ridge to be absorbed by the wall be fore they could cascade downward so great was that walls speed
He saw something like tiny slug for an in stant near the crest and realized it was whale
He saw white specks on the ground microscopic in comparison with the tidal wave swallowed in half second and realized that the lofty buildings of the new city of Ebberhow on Everests base had been destroyed as all things pertaining to humanity must have been destroyed along the tidal waves path
wave mile high
Coming with incalculable speed and force
Tal madge saw the solid wall rush seem ingly upon his own defenseless per son as it rushed for the far lens then saw nothing at all as the water struck the mountains base
Comrades he cried turning from the peephole
The cataclysm is upon us
The first great wave has struck His voice was lost in the trembling and rumbling of the mountain as all of mighty Everest quivered to the shock of that tremendous wall of water
But the people heard and Tohiki with despairing scream sprang to Talmadges side
He was not quick enough almadge ordinarily would have seen his danger as quickly as the agilewitted Tohiki
And God knows he knew enough of hydraulics to realize the incompressibility of water
But the magnitude of what he had seen stunned his brain and Tohiki was not quick enough
At one instant Talmadge stood with the back of his head next to the peep hole and at the next instant Tal madges head had disappeared
His body sank to the floor while over it from the peephole roared oneinch stream of steam and water as straight and solid as metal bar
The lenses pushed before the water column like glass bullets crashed to atoms against the opposite cavern wall ten miles away
The water column en dured for five hundred yards before it feathered to nothingness
It grew in diameter to an inch and half two inches three before the wave outside passed on and left glistening THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE drenched world to rear bared rocks to the air again
Then the two thousand in Tal madges Retreat with their horrible panic allayed went to the body of their leader
Talmadges head had been sheared off almost as though with knife as the lenses shrieked from the peephole
The flesh of his throat at the stub end was pulped almost to the con sistency of whipped cream by the high velocity of the projectiles
concerted moan came from the throng in the cave then shoulders were straightened with grim resolve and faces were turned resolutely toward one another
Outside was drowned and lifeless world one that would be so battered and drowned daily for thousands of years
Inside their leader Talmadge lay dead
But the protecting seal of his liques cent rock and the benificent products of his atomdisrupter lived on after him
The human race had chance at salvation because of the work of his clear mind
the late afternoon Talgor the Tall huddled into the protection of his vacuum suit and stared through the transparency of his oxygen hel met at the familiar landscape spread ing from the vacuumwalled tower beneath him
He looked absently at world as round and smooth as gigantic billiard ball world covered by thin topsoil on which grew patiently nothing but lichenous moss world lit dimly by darkred sun
Time was according to the ancient fables when the sun had been virile and warm and bright
Men did not have to walk abroad in vacuum suits to keep from freezing in the ever lasting cold
Many forms of vegeta tion and of animal life flourished
There had been mountains and val leys lakes and rivers and oceans
Then according to the dim legends great satellite whose name was lost in antiquity had fallen on Earth
It had raised tides that raged for un counted centuries
The tides had smoothed down mountains and filled up depressions
The satellite had broken up shielding Earth from the sun and water had frozen into solid and uniform shell over the worlds smooth face
The countless fragments whirling around Earth had gradually been pounded to dust by meteors am had vanished leaving the world again in the suns rays
But it was dying sun now with little of its original heat
But before the Great Change legend had it that handful of men and women had hidden from chaos in the bowels of Earth under lofty moun tain
They had literally eaten rock tearing down the atoms of whatever material was around them and re making them into lifes necessities
The handful had grown to hundreds of thousands and the small cave into which they had originally gone had become vast underground kingdom
Then they had emerged to the world as it now was to find that they were not the sole form of life still existing
Another form had evolved across tne world from their mountain form so alien and foreign so horrible Talgor looked guiltily around and then hastily pressed the little switch which shielded his thoughts from the Masters
Almost since the memory of present men there had been in the transparent oxygen helmets they were forced to wear in Earths thin atmos phere the familiar transmitter send ing thought vibrations to the head piece receivers of the Masters
It was only year ago that Talgor had devised the sensitizor screen which shielded his thoughts from the transmitter
Now he could keep his thoughts secret when they dwelt on Them though he was aware that death would be his lot if They found it out
He went on with his bleak thoughts
During the chaos caused by the fall of Earths nowforgotten satellite man had survived in his cave
Across the world coldblooded life which man had called fish had also survived
Most submarine life had been killed by the battering tidal waves just as air THRILLING WONDER STORIES breathing creatures had been killed
But few had found refuge in an underground ocean
one could guess how many mil lion years ago that had been
No one could theorize about the evolu tionary course that gradually fol lowed
All that could be said was that when Man came forth from his under ground empire the descendants of these coldblooded marine beings similarly emerged
They were still coldblooded able to freeze and thaw out again without harm
They still breathed oxygen from water their transparent helrrits contained water instead of air
But they walked on four paddlelike legs clothed their glistening and hairless bodies in vacuum suits and in their neverblinking lidless eyes shone in telligence
Much intelligence
They were bigger than Man in brain as well as bulk
Men had stagnated underground
They had kept alive the atomic knovledge compiled by the nameless hero whose inventive genius had kept the race alive but had added no new knowledge
The coldblooded waterbreathing creatures had kept expanding in brain power
They became the Masters with human beings as their slaves
Talgor smiled bitterly
Little enough use men were to the Masters
They were far ahead of men in thinking capacity their hardy physical points made them better fitted to survive in Earths present bleakness
Talgor had often thought that the Masters al lowed mankind to exist only because of Mans hands
Marvelous things hands
With them men and women the slaves could build machines more easily than could the Masters with their an noying flippers
They could more easily manufacture the water the Masters needed for their breathing for long ago all water lying normally on Earths surface had evaporated
But regardless of the purpose the Masters kept the race of mankind in bondage none the less horrible for the fact that the great majority of human beings were not versed in the ancient legends and did not know the comparative servitude they were in
But Talgor knew
He knew that men had once ruled Earth
He knew that men should be superior to these cold and emotionless beings calling themselves Masters
And he plotted for the return of Mans day
He stirred in his vacuum suit and stared over the towers rim
Below he saw several dozen small figures mov ing
They were friends secretly ap pointed to meet him here
He went down the towers core to meet them
score of figures moved to join him as he emerged at the towers base
They were white colorless in way inconceivable to mankind of far earlier day
Their hair was white their skins were white their eyes were white save for pale smudges of pupils
Absolutely without color
Talgor the Tall towered among them
He was nearly four feet in height almost as big as the average Master
You have your thought screens switched on he said swiftly and without preamble
All nodded soberly
They were mov ing on the edge of death meeting here conspiring against the Masters and all knew it poignantly
You are ready to risk your lives to the end that the world be cleared of the Masters and that human beings are supreme again Their white heads inclined second time
You know to the full the bondage in which you are held know said one voice sounding broken and hoarse through the dia phragm in his helmet
My woman was taken last year for thinking against the Masters
They took her helmet and vacuum suit from her and watched while she strangled and froze know said another
short time ago the Masters took my first child
had allowed the third bank of atomrearrangers under my care to slow for needed repair and they sought to punish me
They threw her little girl into the re arrangers
saw her disappear before THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE my eyes
Then They turned the heat control to degrees and ragged blob of codium appeared where my first child had been he others somberly added their tales of horror and oppression
The last concluded on desperate note one which Talgor however had sensed before
The Masters are about to get rid of us believe this man said
Time and again one or more of us has gone mad and revolted
Some of the Mas ters have been killed
Some of their machinery has been smashed
They have had several councils in which men are called unstable and possible menace
They are holding one now
believe that is their last council Talgor the Tall nodded vith des perate calm
believe you speak the truth
believe the race of man is lost unless weapon have been working on for nearly year can save it That is inquired the oldest among the rest
You shall see Talgor led the way into the en trance through the thick vacuum wails of the tower
It was an ordinary supply tower one of the smaller and more remote of the hundred towers which were the scattered heart of all life in which were the latest and finest atomic machines
They were substantially the same as the one which had gone with the handful of human beings into the cavern far in the dim past when the Earths satel lite fell and broke
The unknown hero of that time had come close to the ultimate with his atomdisrupter it was possible to make few improvements
Power was still obtained by borings toward Earths core borings that pierced to the very center now
The nearest available substance was thrown into the disrupters to emerge after varied heat treatments as the various substances of life just as had been done in the cavern
Talgor the Tall led the vay to the boring in this particular tower
Beside the twofootthick nozzle of pure ar drium hardest of all known alloys was squat bell of transparent sub stance within which could be seen numberless tubes topped by circular grid of some metal none of the men had ever seen before
This is the weapon with which hope to save mankind said Talgor his eyes sternly proud as he stared at the bell
Within this bell heat from the boring is converted to electrical energy which is in turn transformed back to radiant heat and stepped up in wave length almost to infinity by the tubes
The radiant heat is capable of passing through atmosphere and other transparent substances to ex pend its energy on whatever opaque body stops it up to range of about ten miles
There its force is dis sipated diminished by the square of the distance traveled
But think the range will be sufficient The others stared at him awed frightened hopeful But the Masters vacuum suits objected one at last
They may be capable of insulating their bodies against even your radiant heat Talgor smiled bleakly Their bodies may be shielded to some extent but not their heads
For they wear the transparent helmets just as we do and my radiant heat will pass through transparencies as it does through atmosphere diminished only by the square of the distance You are sure began one of the rest timidly
am sure of nothing said Talgor
have had no time to experiment properly
The Masters moved too quickly for that
My weapon may kill them it may not
That is the chance we take
Now you must go quickly
The Masters will be here soon The Masters
Here Yes
For the past few minutes have had my thought screen switched off so that they could read my mind and learn of the plot against them here
concealed only the manner of the weapon itself
Within few mo ments the Masters will be here all of them save the very young and the infirm darting to crush me before can menace their race THRILLING WONDER STORIES he other men milled around the tower with frightened cries
For generations fear of the Masters had been inbred in them
The knowledge that in body they were coming here now maddened them with fear
Leave the tower at once Talgors calm voice cracked out
Prepare to kill all survivors of the Masters race as soon as have struck
Prepare to lead mankind back to freedom The men streamed all too willingly toward the entrance
But one said You Talgor
What happens to you Leave the tower instantly before it is too late Talgor interrupted with break in his voice
What would happen to him
He knev only too well what would be his fate what must be the fate of any man within these walls when his radiant heat transmitter began to function
The others ran from the tower
From the soles of their metal boots appeared their gravity plates shield ing mass from Earths gravitational pull
They shot heavenward soared on stub wings slithering from the arms of their vacuum suits shot skyward again when altitude was lost in dis tance repeated the process sky hopping rapidly off to the east
And from the west The face of Talgor the Tall paled under his helmet
The sky to the west seemed to be darkening with great cloud
Only there had been no such thing as cloud in the sky for million years
This blackening was caused by the massed bodies of the Masters every one capable of movement was rushing to Talgors tower because of the frag mentary thoughtthreat he had per mitted them to receive
menace to their race
This one mad human midge must be crushed then more leisurely the rest of the slave race that had lately grown annoying
Talgor watched from the entrance
The up and down advance of the Masters like waves of great black sea rushed upon him
They towered up in last ascent before swooping
He could see individual bodies now monstrous cylindrical bodies witft four stubby limbs heads with taring lidless eyes glaring out through waterfilled helmets
He leaped to the control of his heat transmitter
His thin white fingers clutched it
One touch of that ardrium lever and if his calculations were correct the human race was saved
It was as tremendously sublimely simple as that
But he himself The thin air outside the tower whistled and shrieked with the cleav ing of thousands of stubby wings
Talgor the Tall pulled at the con trol For weeks along the equatorial belt where life was concentrated human beings under the leadership of the score who had been last to talk with Talgor destroyed remaining vestiges of the monstrous race that had en slaved Man for thousands of years
The old and the very young those who had been too distant to get to Talgors tower with the main body all the Masters Talgor had not anni hilated
Then with mankind once more enthroned on Earth they erected great statue to Talgor where the tower had once been
Had once been
There was scant trace of the struc ture now
When Talgor had pulled at the con trol the vacuum walls had blazed and melted allowing the radiant heat to smite full against the wheeling towering horde of Masters
The heat had charred their heads then ex ploded their helmets as the water within was turned to steam
Only blackened fragments strewed the burned earth for miles around all that was left of the last grave threat against humanitys existence
Well there was no tower left no trace of its banked machines
There was nothing left where the tower had stood save distorted transparent bell within which was fused metal
Talgor had given his life horribly when he pulled that control
Talgor was dead
But the human race lived on

bATFLiNE GUARANTEES IC jU StHICE FLIGHT OF THE CHAPTER The Empty Stratocar GAINST sky glorious with flung streamers of scarlet and purple New Yorks leaping towers and arching aerial streetways traced prismatic arabesque epitomiz ing the wonder and the beauty of the Twentyfirst Century
But Don At kins his lithe compact body poised on bigthewed legs widespread and firmly planted was as oblivious to that faroff glory as to the bustle of the Federal Skyport all about him
He stood beneath the high loom of the landing trap squinting into the west out of slitted eyes from whose corners weather wrinkles rayed threadlike and he was conscious of only two things
Under the yellow silk of his air mans tunic small hard lump was cold against his breast
It was the Uii ra Mod ern Sc ience oF ays to Come SILVER EAGLE OB lever that connected to Thomas helmet Ey ARTHUi LEO ZAGAT Author of The Lansotl Screen The Land Where Time Stood Still etc
talisman the Silver Eagle the throbbing pulse in his temples re minded him symbol of the gallant fellowship into whose fold he had been inducted at last
The secret that for months had lain prickling be tween him and his one close friend Bart Thomas was secret no longer
Bart himself darting from the dis tant Pacific would be here in minutes now to receive from him the twisting handgrip of the order
In minutes in seconds now siren howled across the field
black speck notched the low suns up per rim
On time to the dot At kins exclaimed
white blur in the air was suddenly silver teardrop shape caught in the highreaching fin gers of the landing traps gaunt gird ers thousand feet above him
The gigantic beam surged down pivoting on its huge hinge perilously fast at first then more and more slowly as Is Unieasiied When Two Powers Clash THRILLING WONDER STORIES its hydraulic shockabsorbers sapped the stratocars incredible momentum
Atkins dashed for the spot where the duraluminumskinned mancarry ing projectile would ground to end Thomas halfhour flight from Frisco Skyport
knot of browngarbed mechanics clotted around the tiny car
Their wrenches clanged against the bolt heads that had clamped tight the hatch cover against the airlessness of upper space
Twirling metal rasped against metal
The shining oval door swung back
With eager impatience Atkins shoved past the mechanics thrust head and shoulders into the aperture
Happy landing old sock he shouted
Welcome to The greeting froze on his Ups
The tiny cubicle was unoccupied was starkly staringly vacant
In the heat less light of the ceiling tube the tele view screen mirrored the Skyport tar mac glimmered from the glossy leather of the cushion on which Thomas should have lain outstretched
But Thomas wasnt there Atkins skin was tight prickling sheath for his body
The thing was grotesquely weirdly impossible
Im possible for his chum to have got out of the stratocar unless someone had unbolted the hatch from outside
Im possible for it to have landed some where so that that might have been done
To have arrived on the dot of its schedule the stratocar must never have relented from the uttermost limit of its speed
Time lost in any halt could not have been made up
Impossible for there to have been any halt the device was propelled by the blast of an electrostatic catapult at its starting point and had no power of its own
Once stopped it could not have taken up its flight again
And it had come straight as an arrow to the landingtraps hooks at which Frisco had aimed it
fleck of white on the cushion caught Atkins eye
He reached in snatched it up
It was bit of paper and on it Mr
Atkins peremptory voice battered at his giddy brain Conceal that and bring it to me at once The airman thrust the scrap into his pocket whirled
The groundmen were crowding in around him their swart countenances curious but it was evident that none of them had spoken
Then he recalled the tiny receiver clamped against the bone be hind his ear and he knew whence the summons had come
This device hasnt been perfected yet the grey man in the hidden room had said but within tne limits of the field can speak to you through it se cretly and at will There had been viewscreen before him too whose cosmicray eye could scan anything within fifty miles
Close it up Don Atkins snapped and say nothing to anybody Then he was running across the long level tarmac was dashing up the broad steps of Flight Headquarters Build ing was hurrying through the inter minable maze of corridors within
The chaos within his skull took on pattern as the amazing revelations of his initiation came back to him
The nation dreamed itself at peace with all the world
The Asafrican Alliance Americans fatuously thought having driven out the white races from the continents they had so long dominated wanted nothing but to be left alone
hey reckoned without the driv ing ambition of HungChen the new Genghis Khan who had forged an irresistible war machine behind the inscrutable mask of the East and awaited the auspicious moment to launch it against the Occident and the Americas
If he could not be stopped war rapine slaughter must inevitably destroy the Golden Age to which civilization had at last attained
But here was the wallpanel in guarded corridor whose curious quality he had been taught less than an hour before
Atkins halted glanced cautiously left and right
He was un observed
He bent to get his lips close against certain whorl in the blue tracings with which the marble was figured whispered password
whirring sound seeming to come FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE from the very stone itself told him that the impact of his voice had set in motion the soundlock within
The apparently solid marble slid open and the airman went through
The wall thudded shut behind him
In the windowless room he entered short gravefaced man mouselike in grey silk looked up from his desk
Let me see what you found he said without preamble
Atkins fumbled in his pocket with shaking fingers pushed the paper across the desk to the chief of the Silver Eagle
The red lines on it leered at him again the ominous de sign that had pronged him with knowl edge of the catastrophe that had over taken Thomas
deftly drawn dragon was coiled around the orb of Earth one taloned claw sprawling trium phantly to obliterate the double tri angles of the Americas
The chiefs grey face was almost expressionless as he touched the thing with fingertip but under his pale inscrutable eyes little muscles twitched uncontrollably
The token of HungChen he said
Like him to let us know that hes defeated our last device against his spies What does it mean Atkins groaned mental agony making him forget rank for the moment
What does it mean The others tones were very calm only the vaguest flatting betrayed the despair that must be closing in on him like pall
It means that the key to the gaps in the West Coast electrobarrage is in his hands the only thing he needed to enable him to strike
Thomas was bringing the plan to Army Head quarters and hes got Thomas But but you said that the Silver Eagle memorizes all its messages
You said that HungChens spies had tapped every means of secret commu nication weve had and thats why the Sliver Eagle was organized Correct
We thought that band of glorified couriers shot across the continent at speed greater than any yet known would circumvent him
But weve failed
This lets us know that we have failed
They will get it out of Thomas No Atkins fist pounded down on the desk
Bart will never tell
Hell die before he tells He wont die until they know
Theyll strip his brain The chief broke off
But that may take time
If we can find him before He ripped long tape from machine on his desk
straignt purple line traced on it wavered at single point
Look here
This deflection in the flightgraph shows that an extra amount of power was being absorbed between three minutes twelve seconds out of Frisco and seven minutes fortysix seconds after the start
noticed it and thought that the pro jectile had svierved slightly from its course was taking additional energy to straighten it out
But it occurs to me What sir Atkins demanded ex citedly
What That something may have come into the field there betveen three hundred and twenty and seven hun dred and seventy miles from the Pa cific on the great circle course
We might look that region over Im going sir Grey eyes stabbed keenly at the trembling airman
Youre new Atkins
dont know Bart Thomas is my friend
More than brother Very well the grey man made his decision
You may go
And God help you if you are caught
Listen CHAPTER II The KappaRay GREEN light from Traffic Con Xm trol flashed the all clear signal and Atkins thrust his throttle home
His gyrocopter leaped straight up from the fields shot up through the night past the successive glows of the level markers
The red of the lumbering freighterlane the yellow of the localflight zone the cerulean blue of the fivethousandfoot level in THRILLING WONDER STORIES which the great transoceanic liners plied cometlike they surged past in his viewscreen dropped below
Sunburst came to him from over the bulge of the rounding terrain as his ceptor staggered logily
Its roar ing vanes could no longer find any support in the near vacuum of the stratosphere
Atkins twisted the con trols
The liftingvanes collapsed into their slotted grooves
The flyer was sleek silver fish from whose tail the crimson flame of rocket gases fanned out
It darted westward silent and swift as bat out of hell
Atkins throttled down reluctant but obedient to the chiefs instruc tions
He must not overtake the sun darkness would be his best aid
Two red spots burned bright on his cheeks and secret fires flickered in his glow ing eyes
Im coming old man he muttered between his teeth
Im coming Bart
Stick to it
Dont give in
Dont tell them Endlessly blurred Earth streaked Underneath him endlessly the red po sition dot drifted with nerveshred ding slowness across the map framed at the flyers elbow
He shut off the feed unfolded once more the gyro vanes
He drifted down through the darkness silent as cloud in foggy night as invisible
rugged moun tainside forestcloaked swam up into dim view
Atkins checked the descent hov ered
twist of his wrist and the beam of his kapparay projector was searching the serried carpet of the trees
To the unaided eye that beam was utterly imperceptible but on the specially treated screen at wnich the airman peered avidly flickering disc cut through imaged foliage through dark underbrush
To the kapparay all organic matter is transparent only earth stone or metal can reflect it and become visible
Minutes dragged
Bare ground only bare ground netted by branch ing streamlets
Then what was that
Atkins held the ray steady quiver ing with bowstring tenseness
An irregular cube of stone showed misti ly
human habitation in the wilderness
His heart bumped crazily against his ribs
But wait minute it might be Ranger station depot of the men who patrolled this primeval forest that was preserved as national park
Beyond the house metal something huge curiously formed bulked vaguely
Atkins pulse leaped
He had found that which he sought
Thomas cap tors thought themselves well hidden beneath the leafy screen
Evidently the kapparay was one secret that had been successfully kept from them
Lover still Don Atkins dropped until he was bare hundred feet above the treetops
Too bad his search beam could not reveal human forms
He dared not send the map coordinates of this place by radio
He would be overheard the gang would be warned and escape
But at full power it would take him seven minutes to reach Frisco Skyport
Then hun dred pursuit rockets would leap into the air
In minutes the mountain could be surrounded by wellarmed men
He reached for the throttle
The sea of foliage almost black in the long evening shadows glowed suddenly into green flame
Just above the strange building an orange pin point leaped into existence
An in verted cone of radiance soared light ningswift from that focal point
In stantly the copter was bathed in the flare
Intolerable heat struck at At kins
The steel walls about him flamed cherryred
He was frying in the tor rid blast
Already his senses were leaving him with despairing instinct he thrust at the release lever of the emergency hatch beneath his seat no time to snatch at the parachute cone
He was falling falling TKINS lifted slowly back to con sciousness
His body was seared with pain
An iron band constricted his chest and his blood was salty warm on his lips
black silence enveloped him broken by vague rustlings and the sound of trickling water
His dazed eyes adjusted themselves FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE to the dimness and he saw twisted tree branches moonlight sifting through leaves all about him
He was lying across sturdy gnarled bough
Above him he could make out broken branches funneled path torn through thick interlacing foliage
Slowly it dawned on him what oc curred
Plunging down he had struck the lofty crown of some forest giant
The smaller branches the massed ver dure at the top of the tree had ab sorbed the force of his fall
This larger branch had caught and held him had kept him from crashing through to the ground
He had failed miserably
The reali zation wrenched groan from him
Suddenly he tensed clinging tightly to his bough listening acutely
voice sounded
Heavy bodies threshed through the underbrush
yellow glow flickered among the trees below and was gone
It came again held steady as it grew brighter
Two bulk ing shadows appeared forcing through the thick growth
The dim backthrow of lantern beat against the dull green of Rangers uniform familiar to Atkins from hunting and fishing expeditions in these very woods
This was luck
Their post could not be far off with its radiophone
Hed chance coded message to the chief
His throat tightened to cau tious call The lanternbearer stumbled ripped out an oath
It was not in English
His light found his face
High cheek bones thick lips narrow slanted eyes
They were Orientals
They were searching for something
Of course it was he for whom they were looking his body
They want ed to make sure of his death make sure that his crumpled form lying perhaps near trail would not betray their hiding place
The lantern glow flashed dartingly along the ground into the treetops
Atkins tried to make himself part of the limb
Rough bark rasped deep wound in his palm
He flinched uncontrollably lost his grip
He was slipping was falling desperate tightening of his gripping knees flexing of his aching arm muscles stopped the disastrous fall
But the leaves still rustled with his move ments
sharp challenge ripped the forest silence
tube in the yellow hand of one of the searchers spurted blue flame
It shot through the leaves and its heat the acrid smoke of seared greenery stung Atkins nostrils
second bolt came still nearer
Even if they missed him the light of those raytube flashes must reveal him to the hunters
Cut it out Mingai the other Asi atics voice rasped in English
Its nothing but wildcat or some othei animal do not think so
do not like that we have not found the body of the flyer Forget it
He was burned up in the ray The orange ray does not slay
It merely accelerates the electronic vi bration of metallic atoms until the melting point is reached
But for get you would not understand
You are as stupid about scientific matters as the Americans among whom you have been raised
You even speak their barbarous tongue better than the language of your ancestors You give me pain
Come on lets get back
Well tell FuKong to do his own dirty work fMTERY brave you are when he cannot hear you Mingai sneered
But in his presence you cringe and are meek like the rest of us
No friend LiSan we do not re turn as yet All right if youre going to be that way
Lets look further Not till discover what there is In this tree Hope died in Atkins brain
Going to keep on raying till were spotted by some snooping Ranger No there is better way Min gai turned back to the tree
His cyl inder again jetted its blue flame
It was continuous now was boring across the trunk
Back and forth the steady yellow hand drew the disinte grating beam
The great bole quiv THRILLING WONDER STORIES ered started to sway
Atkins got his feet beneath him on the perch leaped down
His aim was true
His heavy boots struck square on Mingais shoulder
He felt bone crack beneath the im pact of his weight
Even as the man dropped the American jumped side ward catlike his lithe form twisting in midair so that he faced the other Oriental
He caught fleeting glimpse of startled countenance then the saffron face was obliterated by the crashing thud of his fist
He whirled away hurtled into the shadowed brush
Thorned tendrils caught and tore at Atkins
root tripped him and he crashed headlong into tree trunk
He thudded to the ground lay there his tortured lungs laboring his outstretched hands plucking at the earthy loam
From behind Atkins heard thin whistle shrill almost above the range of human hearing
From far to his right another responding
Evidently the men from whom he had escaped were signalling for aid
He struggled erect
He was unarmed alone bruised and battered terribly fatigued
But he knew now that he could escape by working down the hill to his left
In the other direction were desperate men weapons at their ruthless com mand that could whiff him into eter nity at will
He turned to the right
CHAPTER III TJie Pursuit Squadron ON ATKINS crouched in the shelter of bush
Before him the stone structure he had seen from the air loomed blackly
Over the clearing rope network carried camouflage of tree branches that his kapparay had pierced
He could hear murmur of voices but the sounds came from beyond or within the squat building
On the side toward him there was silence and nothing moved
The darkness of the wall he faced was re lieved by horizontal line thread of light almost imperceptible
The Americans eyes clung to it
Then he was crawling across the bare ground that lay between
Twenty feet of shelterless surface flecked with the revealing light of the moon
Could he make it unobserved
Inch by crawling inch every muscle every nerve taut with expectation of sudden hail of blue flash that would sear him into nothingness At kins slid toward the beckoning line of light
After an eternity he was in the solid shadow of the wall
He raised himself cautiously and found the place where the light shone through
It was the lower edge of steelshuttered window just at the level of his eyes
He could not see much of the room within the aperture was mere slit
But what he saw was enough
Just within range of his vision was table top black and glistening like glass
Fastened to its surface leather straps cutting deep into the flesh of his arms and legs was Thomas
His friends stocky body was stark naked
In cold lurid light that beat down At kins could see his knotted muscles writhe snakelike the sweat of agony gleaming on his skin
Thomas face was deathly white his clenched teeth were revealed by lips that curved away his eyes were closed and his cheek muscles were quivering
His forehead his hair were covered by metal helmet from which wires curled away out of sight
low mechanical hum rose steadi ly in pitch
Bart Thomas form arched slowly up from the table straining against its creaking bonds
Suddenly the hum stopped and the twisted body slumped flaccidly inertly down
yellow hand slim its long fingers ending in pointed nails came into view holding small sponge to Thomas nostrils
The prisoner quiv ered his eyes opened and Atkins fists clenched as he read the despair that stared from them
He heard voice suavely cruel
It is very painful this searching of your brain
If you chose to talk you would save yourself much anguish Atkins scalp was tight cap for his skull as the bound mans eyelids FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE dropped and lifted again
Even speech seemed too great an effort for him but his lips moved
hand was clamped over Atkins mouth power ful arm wound around him from be hind pinning his own arms to his sides
He was lifted from the ground
He drove desperate heel backward into hard shin
Something crashed against the back of his head and he hung dazed and barely conscious in huge arms that carried his hundred and fifty pounds as though he were child
The room whirled dizzily about Don Atkins
He saw men television screen black tube that rose through the ceiling from some unknown de vice
He was carried through another door and saffronhued face length ened by wisp of grey beard and drooping mustachios under hawk nose drifted hazily before him
Only the eyes were clear black eyes pierc ing behind their slanted lids
Atkins was set down in chair
Hands fumbled at him passed rope around him binding him to his seat
He scarcely noted it spellbound by those glittering eyes
His fogged brain cleared bit and he saw tall Oriental imperturbable
There were banked tubes glowing behind him and bright copper coils
To one side table its black top glistening like glass
Thomas strapped down was looking at him with eyes in which in credulity and horror flared
The tall Oriental spoke
Who is this NaGarri rom behind Don huge black came in view
Dressed like the others of the gang in the olivegreen of the Rangers he was still redolent of the jungle
His skin was deep dull black that swallowed light
His bullet head sat queerly on wide shoul ders from which arms thick as sap lings hung loosely almost to his knees
His voice was throaty rumble
dont know
Lord FuKong
But the electriceye alarm he flash and find this one peeking in
So bring him to you
Maybe he the one who we bring down from the plane the one who jump on Mingai and LiSan The other nodded
He seems very persis tent To Atkins You display great deal of interest in our proceed ings
hope you are satisfied with your present opportunity to observe them He reached out clawlike hand and ripped away the front of the airmans shirt
He snatched at the token hang ing there
The fine gold chain snapped and he had it in his hand
faint smile crossed the jaundiced mask of his face and he held the tiny bird out to the black
Not half inch long it was but exquisitely wrought
An eagle poised as if in flight it seemed almost alive
See NaGarri this is another of the brood
They wear talismen about their necks like your own tribesmen to bring them good luck
But fear the Dragon of HungChen is too strong for their puny godlet He turned back to the American
shall deal with you in moment when have finished vith your comrade
Watch closely American and wish you joy of what you see Now he was talking to Thomas and his voice was crawling threat
Have you decided to answer my questions No Thomas voice was tor tured whisper but his lips closed tight and firm
Fear and despair drew haggard lines across his face
FuKong shrugged stepped to the wall where tall slate panel glit tered with switchpoints gages gleaming ebony wheels
Still stubborn
You will not be lieve me then that this searcher will delve deeper and deeper into the core of your brain till it wrenches the ut termost secrets of your ego from you
Yet it was an American who first proved that thought is an electric process who first measured the tiny currents that flow along the nerves
Well if you must have it His fin gers closed on lever just above bind ing posts to which the wires trailing from the helmet on Thomas head trailed
Now FuKong
FuKong shrill cry from the outer rooiti stopped him
THRILLING WONDER STORIES Another plane has appeared above Atkins forced his head around
Min gai was in the doorway his shoulder bandaged his right arm in sling
Well why burst in on me like this FuKong was imperturbable
Send someone to dispose of the re mains The others face was sickly green
But it got away he gasped
It got away The phrase was like the purr of an enraged cat
My broken arm had to use my left missed with the orange ray and before could aim again he was out of range Mingais voice trailed away in an apologetic murmur
You the other began fury breaking through the stony mask of his face
But again there was an in terruption
sallow Hindu appeared
Master the plane that escaped is signalling to Frisco Skyport and their rocket squadron is taking off The chief had not failed them
He had sent following plane that by great good luck had escaped the Asi atics lethal ray
Atkins calculated hastily
In ten minutes now this nest would be surrounded the spies cap tured Thomas freed and his secret safe
UT FnKong was snapping per emptory orders
Mingai and the Hindu had disappeared NaGarri was unstrapping Thomas was carry ing him out
The Oriental leader him self raytube in hand was unfasten ing the rope that bound Atkins
Get up and precede me The spy gestured with his weapon
The American obeyed staggering on limbs that were needling with returning blood
He was through the outer room his captor close behind him was in the open
ahead loomed monstrous metal shape
Egg shaped it was save for one end that was sliced off sharply and there was an opening manhigh in its side
Na Garri was just vanishing within with his burden
Atkins followed
Fu Kong clanged shut the slide behind him
steel ladder mounted through dim green light curving over an in ner shell
Atkins head came through trapdoor above and he was in low long chamber
Then he was once more tightly bound
rough shove from the black sent him sliding across the floor to thud against Thomas trussed and naked form
LiSan was just closing the trap door
Mingai fear in his eyes was thrusting up on valvehandle that projected from large vertical pipe in the wall
At the far end before large viewscreen the Hindu was seated black discs of phone receivers clamped to his ears
Beside him Fu Kong bent over serried row of gages and levers atop metal console
large viewscreen before him showed the forestbordered clearing and the stone building that had been vacated in such haste
FuKong pushed at lever and the viewscreen was flare of flame
It cleared
Where the house had been was gaping hole in the ground
Orientals hand moved again
The screen was downrushing blur
It cleared once more
Velvetblack star strewn the night sky was about them and the farbelow forest was dark mysterious sea
Don old man the whispering voice in his ear was Thomas how on earth did you ever get into this mess came to find you Atkins said grimly
And did
How are you Pretty rocky
But Ill keep until FuKong gets chance to work on me again cant understand how he ever got hold of you
Your carrier came in right to the dot
What happened was zipping along watching the shoot past in the screen when suddenly something flashed over me and dropped down in front Shot over you
thought the rocketstratocars were the fastest things ever produced So did until saw this craft
Ill bet it can make three hundred miles minute
It passed me as if were standing still
At any rate there it was right ahead of me and slowing
The blunt end was toward me and thought sure was going FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE to crash into it
No way to swerve those carriers you know
But just as reached it hole opened and sailed right inside Good Lord
Then its sort of flying trap
Damned in genious eh
can figure out the rest of it now
You say the stratocar reached New York on time
That means they closed the stern and speeded up again till they were mak ing just the rate was
Afterward they went faster once more got clear of my boat and dropped away
They had just picked me out of it on the fly
LL knew at the time was that my hatch opened and the big black was pointing raygun at me
He told me to get out and got
VVe were in an airlock and there was rope ladder hanging down
climbed it and found myself in this room
Fu Kong was here and the Hindu
Then in little while we were down in the clearing where the others were wait ing
After that my troubles really began Look at the screen be said sharply
Atkins twisted himself back to his original position
In the distance score of scarlet lights made dancing crescent on the viewscreen
They rose and fell but came on steadily
He thrilled at the sight
These were the army flyers from Frisco Skyport
No mistaking that formation
Those farspreading wings would sweep around as the center checked and the Asafrican craft would be caught in an enfilading fire
FuKong and his gang were doomed
Peculiar how calmly they were taking it
East ern fatalism he supposed
Eastern fatalism hell
Memory fanged him
Thomas had just told of the incredible speed at FuKongs command
The spy master was not trapped far from it
He could get away at will
Why was he hanging here motionless watching those on coming flyers sardonic smile ting ing his yellow face
Nearer and nearer the lights came
The dim shapes of the army rocket planes showed phantomlike
The cen tral ship dipped minutely and the long line began to expand
The mot ley crew of the spy ship clustered be hind their leader in the bow
Near enough FuKongs voice rang like sentence of doom
long pencil of orange light shot out from his vessel wavered impinged on the nearest plane
The flyer flared red then dazzling white at the tip of the beam
Then there was nothing there
The death ray moved on to the next in line
All along that farflung line cor uscation of green swept as the in domitable fighters shot out their fu tile answer
Lethal enough those rays but their range was far short
Another plane was caught in the orange beam and vanished
But the squadron came on their mile long firetails lashing them through the night
If one only one could get near enough to spear the Asafrican craft with its beam
Taking that one des perate chance the birdmen rushed into the face of destruction never falter ing never wavering as ship by ship the orange scythe reaped its deadl harvest
Only ten ships were left of the score that had first appeared only nine and still the green rays were miles short of their mark
Minutes passed that were long as eternity
Eight of the intrepid at tackers remained then seven
But now the stabbing darts of emerald death were almost reaching their mark
little more only little more
Suddenly the floor vibrated and Atkins heard the muted thunder of the crafts rocket blasts
The spy ship was moving at last
FuKong would escape that vas unavoidable
The terrific speed of his strange vessel could never be matched by the combination planeandrocket craft of the Americans
But at least the pitiful handful remaining would escape the holocaust
Seeing the fu tility of their courageous attempt they would return to their base perhaps eifectuate plans for countrywide en circling movement that might in the long run bring the yellow ship dovn
No Atkins mouth twisted in THRILLING WONDER STORIES Boundless oath the Oriental had no intention of permitting that
The distance between the spycraft and the nearest attacker did not in crease
The Asiatic was keeping just beyond the range of the green rays was taking toll on the American avia tors with false hope while the merci less orange beam flared out mowing the velvet night with destruction
CHAPTER IV The Dragon of HungCben UT of the twenty flyers who had soared to the attack bare SiX still charged on
They were insane
They couldnt win But couldnt they
Atkins stifled gasp was taut with sudden hope
Five of the squadrons remnant had startlingly changed their tactics
They were zigzagging were darting left and right up and down in what seemed last panicky attempt to evade the Asiatics ray
Senseless it seemed but there was one ship that had left the group
Its green ray was doused only the pin point red of its tailflame betrayed its course to Atkins
He flung out his soul in wordless prayer that neither FuKong nor his aides would notice that stealthy climb
Steadily the squadron leader mount ed till the scarlet dot that marked him out was touching the upper margin of the viewscreen
Ten thousand feet below his comrades flitted about in their macabre dance cheating the orange death again and again by breathless inches
The attention of the enemy crew was concentrated on those darting shapes on their darting ineffective rays
Atkins eyes flicked back to the lone flyer
He saw the sudden crimson burst saw the dovmward curve of its flaring wake as terrific swoop began saw the green ray dart out ahead spearhead of the diving hawk
Down and down and down adding the pull of Earth to his own driving blasts the avenger plunged in one last magnifi cent effort to catch the destroyer un aware zipping faster and faster until even in that tenuous air the steel planebody glowed dull red with the friction of its unleashed speed
minutes grace sixty unobserved seconds of that lightning slant and it would snip the yellow menace from the skies
Look FuKong look It was Mingai who yelped the alarm
The orange ray swept up
Jammed By luck by the luck with which the gods award the greatly daring the downdarting American had found the one vulnerable angle of the spy ship
Green flame licked out hungri ly but FuKongs hand was light quick in its flash to the throttle lever
His ship lurched jerked aside in the last possible moment of safety
The American was under now right under the spycraft
But the dragon ship was driving ahead
In an eyeblink FuKong would be able to bring his death ray to bear on the daring flyer
Don Atkins flung heavi ly across the floor by the sudden jerk saw not quite three feet above him gleaming copper handle the valve at which Mingai had twisted just before the takeoff
Legs lashed arms bound sweat pouring from his lined brow eyes bulging from their sockets by sheer power of stomach and trunk muscles alone he swung his torso from the floor
His head came level with that handle
His teeth clamped around it
Corded sinews stood out on his neck as he drove the valve lever down
Sud denly he was snatched loose by lurch of the craft and his preposterously twisted body crashed down
But that very lurch told him of suc cess
It was the main fuelvalve
He had cut off the rockettubes supply
In an instant now the vessel would be caught in the raybeam of the pi lot below
Atkins tensed to meet the green flash that would mean oblivion for FuKong and his myrmidons and for Bart Thomas and himself
It never came
shrill high pitched oath footsteps running to ward him pulled open his eyes
Fu Kong was bending over him face livid with wrath raygun rising for the FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE eoup de grace
Behind him LiSan came up strange glow between his slant lids
Atkins eyes flicked past the couple
In this final moment life he must know what had happened why his intended sacrifice had failed
BLUE electric veil shimmering and sparking in cerulean net work of tiny lightnings curved ail across the viewscreen
Beyond it the misty shapes of the attacking aircraft spat their green beams
The emerald death rays spattered harmlessly on the ionic curtain and were quenched
From within the orange ray thrust futilely against the hollow defensive sphere of force
This Atkins saw in single flash ing glance
Then he was staring up at the enraged Oriental was waiting in timeless void for the blue spurt that would sear thought and con sciousness and life itself from his de spairing brain
Wait Master LiSan snatched at FuKongs hand swerved it aside from its aim
That way is too easy for the paleskinned dog
Let me and Mingai take care of him
Ve have debt to pay for vhat he did to us in the wood In the others slitted eyes glint of satisfaction showed
had my doubts of you LiSan
Twice you have shown deplorable softness in your tasks
This like much better
You may have your wish
But take him below have much to do and do not wish to be dis turbed Atkins skin crawled
Death he could face calmly but that which the fanatic gleam in LiSans saffron mask promised made him coward
FuKong he croaked barely able to force the words through his con stricted throat
Dont give me to him
Kill me yourself
That would be clean and honest But the Ori ental was walking away
They took him down through the trapdoor carried him down flung him heavily on the plates in the narrow space between the entrance hatch and the curving inner shell
Untie him Mingai There was an undercurrent of eager excitement in LiSans tones
Even in the face of what was to come Atkins wondered at the gratuitous cruelty of the Ori ental mind
Mingai stooped to him fumbled at his lashings
As they fell away the American leaped up to make fight of it
Hopeless of course Li San had his raygun poised for action
Better to go out that way than to suf fer the planned revenge of the sadis tic duo
Now Hands up Mingai
Quick The virulent threat in LiSans voice made the low command seem crashing shout
Mingai straightened
His arms flew above saffron face from which amazement and horror had stripped its habitual mask
LiSan was braced on spread feet his raygun thrust before him
His countenance was alight with strange flame and his eyes snapped menace
One whimper from you and flash There was an instant of stunned silence
Then LiSan spoke again
Here you American
Grab those ropes
Tie him up and gag him
Quick man Dazed by the sudden turn Atkins obeyed
VVhat lay behind this sudden act on the Asiatics part
Had he suf fered sudden change of heart He recalled in the wood LiSan trying to argue Mingai out of his determina tion to search the tree in which he was hiding
He recalled LiSans inter THRILLING WONDER STORIES vention with FuKong moment ago that had certainly saved his life His task was finished Mingai tightly bound and strip from his own tunic jammed none too gently into his mouth
Before Atkins could oice his questions there was sud den dull roar which shook the vessel
Hes getting under way again Li San barked
Weve no time to lose He plucked Mingais raygun from his belt thrust it into the Americans hand
Come on He was flitting silently up the ladder Atkins per force after him
hey were just beneath the rivet studded trap
LiSan lifted the lid slowly till narrow crack of brighter light showed along its edge
Atkins managed to crush in alongside of him on the narrow step and to gether they peered through the slit
The blue defensive sphere was gone and the attacking ships had vanished
But something else showed in the sky long slim torpedolike object that sped straight for the spy ship
From its nose white light flickered in rapid series of dots and dashes
Atkins felt an electric quiver of tense ness run through the yellow man against whose body his own was crushed
strange pattern formed itself in the Americans mind as he crouched there waiting for he know not what
That oncoming shape had the very form of the rocketstratocars used by the Silver Eagle
Yet this was no messenger waylaid as Thomas had been
He had signalled to FuKong
Why had the spycraft waited here chancing the fight with the American planes when it might have been away and gone with only the slightest ef fort
What was it that glowed from LiSans eyes that shook him with an ague of eagerness
Nearer came the speeding rocket and nearer still until it passed out of sight at the lower edge of the view screen
The larger craft lurched and lurched again
FuKong thrust at his levers there was hiss of rushing air
Then buzzer shrilled
Hes picking up the stratocar Li San whispered
Get ready All right NaGarri FuKong called
The air in the entrance lock is at normal pressure
Open up The black bent to ring in the cen ter of the floor and pulled on it
round manhole lid came away
head appeared and squat broad body followed it
Straight black hair tiny black eyes almost hidden by high cheekbones broad flat nose over thick red lips this was Tatar face throwback to the Mongol hordes that in the Thir teenth Century ruled half the then known world by force of arms
From that stocky figure emanated an aura of power of dominance
Unbounded ambition lust for power savage cruelty were stamped on the round flaccid countenance
LiSan clutched Atkins arm his fingers sinking into the flesh
Its HungChen
Come himself to receive FuKongs reports
To morrow the attack Atkins under stood why the spymaster had been un able to flee
He had had to wait here for his chief no way to change the course of the stratocar once it had started
The huge black bowed low
The Hindu joined him in humble obeis ance
The haughty FuKong came away from his controls abject ser vility in every line of his tall body
The Mongol spoke sharply and there was rapid exchange in shrill high piping tongue
Now The snapped word from Li San galvanized Atkins into action
He thrust upon the hatch leaped
The yellow men swung to the sound of the falling trapdoor saw tvo apparitions spring into view ray guns at the ready
Throw up your hands
Up viith them Atkins shout drove through the chamber
Up or we wipe you out LiSans eyes were blazing pits of wrath
NaGarris simian arms went ceilingward the Hindus
Hung Chens
FuKong ripped out viru lent Traitor at LiSan and snatched at the cylinder in his belt
Sssss Blue lightning hissed from Atkins weapon
blackened FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE corpse crumpled slowly to the floor Any more His voice was thick with fury
But the remaining three stood statuelike
We surrender came the voice of the captured over lord
Dont flash heir captives tightly bound the two Don Atkins the American and LiSan the Chinese turned to one another
Atkins hand went out to the other then hesitated drew back
LiSan straightened
No he answered the question in the Americans eyes am not trai tor to my own people
Here his hand tapped his own breast there are two loyalties one to the race among whom was born among whom have lived my life and have my friends the other to the race of my ancestors
War between them vas unthinkable to me He glanced down at Hung Chen bound and glowering looked up again wdstful smile hovering on his saffron face
Now there will be no war
Im sorry couldnt save the squadron of planes
had to wait until he arrived you see
And it was too dangerous before to attempt to capture the ship You joined their rotten gang risked death and worse to defeat their plans to save your own people and mine from the horrors of var Atkins exclaimed
By God LiSan you are man Yellow hand and white met and clasped
Hey you fellows came Bart Thomas weak voice from the floor
When you get time you might take three or four of these ropes off me and get me something to wear

HOW THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT WAS DETERMINED ight travels approximately miles second and heres how Professor Michelson first proved it
beam of light was reflected from one of the sides of revolving twelvesided block each side of which was mirror itself
This made successive flashes of light
These rays were sent long distance about mile and were reflected back again from mirror
The distance the twelvesided or faceted mirror moved in the time it took the flash to go to the other mir ror and return was the basis for figur ing the speed of light
BACTERIA WITHIN METEOR here is proof of the possibility of life upon other planets
Pro fessor Charles Lipman of the Uni versity of California claims to have recently discovered living micro scopic organisms in meteorites which have flashed across the ether to Earth from other planets
The interior of the meteorite the professor explained remained cool while the outside burst into flaming fragments
BLUE EYES ARE NOT BLUE
yes that are grey brown or black are so colored because the iris contains pigment of that tint
In the case of blue eyes however the outer layer of the iris is colorless and transparent
The inner layer is ex posed
This is white and reflects and scatters the light which strikes it
The blue rays of light being the shortest are scattered most readily
In consequence the iris which is real ly white appears blue
The blueness of eyes is similar to that of the sky the latter also being caused by the scattering of blue light by the upper atmosphere

MATHEMATICAL MISTAKE ALTERED THE SCIENCE OF ELECTRICITY LARGE group of eminent scien tists and engineers once made an error in mathematics which altered the whole science of electricity
In congress of engineers and phy sicists from all over the world con vened for the purpose of establishing definitely and permanently the sizes of the various electrical units ohm farad etc
for there was much con fusion in this matter
It was finally decided to make the abampere the absolute or physicists unit of current exactly equivalent to the ampere the practical or engi neers unit of current
On this ba sis the relative magnitudes of the other electrical units in each of the two systems absolute and practical were to be determined
Througn some undetected error in arithmetic the abampere was made equal to onetenth of an ampere and not equal to whole ampere asthe con gress had decided
As result of this error the relative values of all the electrical systems in the two systems are different from vhat the congress set out to make them
Whereas the scientists wished to make an abcou lomb equal coulomb the latter is in stead ten times the former
And so on and on
This error which was never corrected thus altered the en tire science of electricity

CURVED LIGHT cience can now bend light
Pre viously except for the great spacecurvatures vhich Relativists say surround stars and suns no con ceivable agency or material could actually cause light to travel in curve
This feat was accompished by Dr Harry Robert Dittmar of the Du Pont Research Laboratories with the aid of Pontalite new plastic known chemically as methyl methac rylate polymer
Du Pont scientists recently demonstrated that pretzel shaped length of Pontalite could con duct light carry it around bends as cable carries electricity
flashlight was held close to one end of the twist ed plastic tube
The other end of the tube shone brightly
The reason why Pontalite bends light is because of the crystalline structure of the material which re fracts the light in series of very straight lines joined at slight angles like bar links in watch chain so that the light stays inside the conductor until it reaches the end
DOWN on the FARM in the Hygienic Age of the Future Harold Faddley Aged Commits Crime Supreme
By SIMPSON STOKES he hard irregular shape of the selfadjusting Nibbler moved over the grassland like gigan tic mechanical cow only it had cater piller traction bands instead of legs
Its thirtytwo jaws working alter nately in echelons of eight opened
rhythmi cally
Professor Obinson had well remembered the importance of achiev ing conditions as identical as possi ble with those produced by the teeth and jaw action of herbivorous ani mals before the fodder went into the Metabolisers
Farmer Geary watched the Nibbler at work
He saw beyond it the vast threestoried acreages of his Multi pleCrop Flats incongruously tilt ed on the side of Durdleberry Slopes in the distance
The bizarre shadow of the combined WindSuncatcher like spray of tulips mounted fan wise on rotating mast slanted across the meadow
This is good said Geary rubbing his hands
This is fine He had been reading through his accountants estimate of balance and saw every prospect of being nearly ten per cent up on the previous half year
His Soya byproducts his fi brous residues and his Metaboliser It looked like gigantic mechanical cow
DOWN ON THE FAEM fodder all showed most healthy in crease
Indeed the only slight set back had been in the thirdtier Chlo rophyl crops from the Flats and this had been due solely to mechanics unaccountable error in setting the thermostats
Well he would settle this mechanic
Mason it was
He had already appealed to the Commission claiming for the loss to be made good
This would probably reduce Masons superannuation prospects to those of the Third Class unless he made good in the next year or two by earning Maxima Efficiency Bonuses
So Farmer Geary had every reason to feel pleased with himself as he re turned to the gleaming steelandglass farmhouse
He found the Portrals there and old Faddley and his wife and young Tim on vacation from the University of Agriculture
They had been talk ing about old times and new as people will in all ages
The greatest blessing of all Mrs Portral was saying as Farmer Geary stepped in from the lawn well its hard to say
remember when was girl my mother used to tell me about how she used to mix foods together and put them into pots and ovens instead of just heating the carton
She said that it was full days work doing all that unnecessary mixing and cooking and cleaning plates and dishes afterward
Fancy having to use plates and dishes over and over again Couldnt have been really hy gienic agreed Tim
But then the twentyfirst century was never much in advance of the tenth in the busi ness of feeding think that the greatest blessing has been the abolition of edible ani mals said Farmer Geary adjusting recliner and settling himself at the most comfortable angles
Imagine the horrible animal smells and the dirt the sweating skins and sali Dont be coarse Elbert Mrs vating mouths the flies Geary said
Well Ive been to outlandish coun tries where they still have such aw ful habits havent
It nearly made me sick to see the way they depended on vegetation being transmuted through the filthy stomachs of ani mals for meat and milk
Ill give my unhesitating vote to syn thetic Metabolising Plant every time Harold here remembers cows and sheep in this country said Mrs Fad dley
Dont you Harold and Geary shuddered
When was boy near hundred and thirty year ago worked on one of the last of the old farms agreed old Faddley
But was used to it you see and loved the smells of the farmyard and the lowing of the cows and the simple Nature in it all
Thats why Im in the egglayers side of the business today
To handle live birds an to take interest in em reminds me of old times you see They even used to eat chickens as meat in those days didnt they Mr Faddley This was from Tim
course they did Tim
But they wasnt the featherless birds we uses today you see
They had plump flesh and lots of feathers fair bunches of em like you can see at the zoo
And they used to run about the yard an scratch in the ground an peck an cluck an squat in the dust like any thing
Twas music to me ffMJEOPLE killed them Mrs Portral interrupted hastily
Then they plucked all the nasty in sanitary feathers off and then they actually burnt them in ovens lubri cating them with animal fat and pigs meat while they burnt
remember my mother telling me Talk about cannibalism said Portral
The chief business of life today said Geary
The whole business say consists of and should consist of nothing but the efficient production and distribution of foodstuffs and manufactures and the vigilant observ ance of hygiene and sanitation Control of course sir educa tion Tim suggested bashfully
We can leave that to those respon sible Tim quailed before Gearys truculent eye
said the chief busi THRILLING WONDER STORIES ness of life my boy Old Faddley in the arc of the wall near the humidor switch wished that some other topic of conversation had been chosen
The very mention of oldstyle farms brought with it strange nostalgia
While he had been speaking of the smells and sounds of his boyhood days on the land they came back to him with such vividness that he thereafter drifted into day dream
He fancied himself standing by gate watching the cows coming through from the churnedup pathway
There were no sounds of mechanism or whirr of wheels not even the dis tant chugchug of WindSuncatcher
The air was calm warm with peace fulness as the cows came sedately through whisking their tails one after the other pausing for an instant to swing their heads sideward and favor Faddley with meaningless stares
And the field in which they grazed
The surface was delightfully uneven there were tufts and tussocks of grass not the soulless smoothness of mod ern meadows ready for great lumber ing clattering Nibblers to work on
How well he remembered
In the far corner near vhere the cabbages start ed were the hay ricks and vhat pleasing aroma came from them es pecially when the sun came smiling after shower
Pigs and fowls and big farm horses and ducks
He never tired of watching the fam ily of ducks waddling comically after the mother to the dear dirty pond be hind the stables
Dear oh dear
Twas well over century ago
Theres no smell like the farmyard mixture he thought and theres no animal like cow
Nevertheless on emerging from his reverie he felt that he had been be trayed by his unguarded enthusiasm into social indiscretion
He noticed difference in Gearys manner at once
Mrs Portral also had looked at him with an expression of distaste
There was that sort of aloofness evi dent in the room which might have followed the utterance of blas phemy
From that moment Faddley ceased to visit the Gearys
He shrank into his shell
Beyond an occasional busi ness trip by air to Canada or to Ber muda he seldom stirred from his egg farm
He even refused his usual at tendance as delegate at the Egg Union weekend meeting in Rio de Janeiro
Sad about the old man was the general verdict
Getting into the sere and yellow at last
Never was truly with the times you know
Of course he has to be uptodate with production methods because of the Law but at heart hes reactionary People shook their heads and went about their business leaving old Fad dley to his egg hatcheries
Such progressive age with so many diver sions to occupy what used to be known as leisure could easily for get man who properly belonged to the past
But Faddley was destined to emerge from obscurity at last and to dart across the suy of the worlds news like meteor of sensational di mensions
There was scarcely civi lized home in the five continents in which the Faddley Case was not topic of conversation from the mo ment of its first flashing on their visi screens one of the biggest news scoops in the history of the Nord EurbpeAmerica Transmission
ARMER GEARY had authentic firsthand information of the event
He retailed his intelligence with gusto to the visitors who had dropped like locusts on his tarmac oi hearing that he had something to say Thus Geary shared in the sensation to his great satisfaction
In his fa vorite attitude on the recliner he thus held forth can tell you all about it the most amazing thing thats happened in America for many long year He had great opinion of himself as raconteur and meant to make the most of his opportunity now
This fellow Faddley is perhaps the oldest man in the egg business today
Hes old in point of years too
Well most of you know him believe
DOWN ON THE FARM jHere is an instance where the crook edness of age warps mans mind and sends him into groove of madness
suppose he had felt himself gradu ally being left behind by the younger generation you know snubbed would be the word and it preyed on him
Anyhow it turns out that for some months before the tragedy he had indulged in sort of ritualistic retirement meditation and so on in one of his big egg flats that he kept for emergencies
Imagine man of his age locking himself in that enor mous building surrounded by tier upon tier of empty incubators laying boxes and all the paraphernalia of his trade
solitary little figure in that great loneliness tired of the world or disgusted with it dont know which
Hed stay there all day so Mrs Faddley said and most of the night only going indoors to his home toward dawn
Nothing she could say would shake the old fool
If she want ed him to meet company he would growl out that he had no time for it
The man must have been daydream Jng for he had known the whole place inside out for years and that the Re serve Flat had always been empty and had never heard so much as single cluck from layer
Anyhow as the inner door swung open there came to the ears of the inspector dreadful sound like soul in torment echo ing in the back recesses of the Flat and then old Faddley came running out with face as white as death What time yesterday did the ar rest take place asked young air man
was up at the time and had no visiscreen on the dash Seven oclock on Tuesday eve ning replied Geary
About four hours after He was interrupted by the flashing of the visiscreen that occupied the greater part of the wall to his left
By Jove he said heres the end of the tale For the visiscreen flashed Faddley Case Trial Result
Harold James Faddley age of Upman Egg Farm Wilts sentenced to suspension from all public production work with loss of privileges for life
He admitted his guilt on all counts to smuggling from Yunen Province of China by Air Egg Liner to harboring in Federal domains and on scheduled premises to leading on scheduled grassland under con cealment of night contrary to hygienic acts and public laws prohibited animal to wit cow

Lanoth started walking toward the Wanderer his cohorts behind him WANDERER of the VOID By DR ARCH CARR Author of The Discus Men of Ekta Warriors of Eternity etc
PALL of intense sadness lay like blanket upon the grounds and the dullgleaming mansion of Walter Brundage owner of the small dark star Merthel
For Janice Garth Brundages beloved young granddaughter had for many hours lain ill with some strange malady
Miriam Garth mother of the strick en child stood before the screen in the visigraph room impatiently wait ing for the operator to adjust his ap paratus to the broadcast beam
Then at signal from the technician she swept up the portable speech trans mitter
Brundage City on Merthel calls WANDERER OF THE VOID ing the Wanderer
Calling the Wan derer
Emergency call
Brundage City calling the Wanderer
The young woman spoke into the microphone until her throat became dry her voice husky
But there was no answer to her call
The visigraph screen was blank
Had she been too late
If only Daniel her husband were here with her now how much easier it would be to bear
She longed for the comfort of his arms his soft words of encouragement his love
Daniel Garth who had been enmeshed in web of circumstantial evidence built up by lawless conspirators Daniel who had been convicted and sentenced for life in the Plutonian penal institution for crime which he had never committed
Suddenly the glittering surface of the visigraph screen reddened
Words in flat metallic voice crackled from the reproducer
The Wanderer stands by for visual connection with Brundage City Mer thel The visigraph cleared and there ap peared before Miriam Garth the image of the universal man of mystery the Wanderer
weird picture there on the screen the picture of man clad in grotesque black steel space suit of type not generally accepted by rocketmen
No person knowingly had ever gazed upon the features of the Wan derer
There were no transparent windows in his helmet and he had never removed his space shell in the presence of others
Neither had his natural voice ever been known to reg ister upon human ears
Two retinascopic photoelectric cells set in the face of his helmet surmounted the slitted orifice of speech reproducer
On either side of the iron head was sensitive cylin dric microphone
small oxygene rator of peculiar design was affixed to the armor of his shoulders
Thus the Wanderer vas able to breathe see hear and speak without his identity becoming known
Miriam Garth daughter of Valter Brundage calls the Wanderer Mir iam spoke nervously into the trans mitter
My daughter has been brought down by strange form of lethargic encephalitis which our Mer thelian physicians do not understand
Daniel Garth the childs father who is prisoner on Pluto is affected sim ilarly
But Dr Vacor the prison sur geon has been able to keep him alive for three years
feel that if Dr Va cor could see my child there might be chance to save her life Breathless Miriam paused then went on But we have no space ship in which to carry her to Pluto
Bors Lanoth the pirate attacked our city and destroyed the only ship on the planet
If you are near Merthel will wont you take her The Wanderers electromechanical countenance showed no sign of hu man emotion as he replied Prepare the child for the flight
shall land upon Merthel shortly The distant sun pale and anemic plunged beneath the jagged western horizon as the Wanderers trim little ship with braking rockets bellowing mighty challenge to the bleak Mer thelian landscape dropped gently upon the ground near the Brundage mansion
side port in the ship hissed spun open and the Wanderer stood there on the ground waiting his electric eyes casting twin shafts of dull smokyred light into the shadows
Miriam Garth and her father both clad in heavy electrically heated fur garments approached the ship
Wal ter Brundage bore the unconscious form of his granddaughter in his arms
The Wanderer motioned them toward the open port
He waved aside their thanks board ed the ship behind his passengers closed and sealed the port
He made them comfortable and placed the child on springsuspended litter fastened her securely to guard against the strain of acceleration
Then he went to the controls of his oneman ship
He turned to Miriam and her father said Ascension THRILLING WONDER STORIES Ready replied Brundage
The Wanderer glanced at the indi cators before him moved lever
The ship rose rapidly on an even keel her underjets roaring in crescendo
Acceleration Again Brundage spoke their readi ness
With blast of stern rockets the ship shot outward in long arc to ward the disc of Pluto The Wander er his body braced against the sup port rails gradually adjusted the gravitation plates as Merthels pull lessened
After the fierce thrust of accelera tion had subsided Miriam let her eyes linger upon the motionless figure of the pilot
Who was this strange man in black steel armor this weird avenger of crime who was ever ready to assist someone in acute distress
Laymen on every planet had ad vanced the theory that the Wanderer was senseless cosmic ray automa ton remotely controlled by some hu man intelligence
But scientists con tended otherwise
The Wanderer had displayed certain reflexes to un foreseen contingencies they claimed that denoted perfect coordination of mind and body
This could not have occurred the men of science stoutly declared in the case of mechanical robot
The Wanderer had first come into interplanetary prominence by swoop ing to the aid of group of embattled space patrolmen on the inner satellite of Mars and assisting them in the ex termination of band of pirates
Thereafter wandering ceaselessly through the black night of space the Wanderer had waged an almost singlehanded warfare against piracy until but one outlaw leader now re mained alive Bors Lanoth
The Wanderers deeds had made of him legendary figure of romance and mystery had earned him the title Wanderer of the Void
And the fact that he was masked unknown lent glamour to his exploits
He had agreed to reveal his iden tity only when Bors Lanoth last of the space pirates no longer roamed the skies
Thus Miriam sat in meditation fo
many long minutes her mind review ing the Wanderers colorful history her thoughts returning at last to her personal troubles
There was Daniel her husband convicted felon who for three years had lain in deathlike sleep in the Plutonian prison
And now Janice was affected in like manner
What was the nature of this unknown physi cal condition tnat had seized them
Tears started afresh to Miriams eyes
She turned toward the observa tion port beside her gazed out in an abstracted manner
Then she sat up right in her chair
Many miles out across the black ness of space she saw the unmistak able orangered flame from the stern jets of space ship the yellow dots that were portholes in the side of the vessel
She announced her discovery to the Wanderer
Yes he said know
That ship has been pacing us for more than an hour
It is Bors Lanoths flagship manned by his followers from the reptile planet
knov it by the set of its rockets
For long time have sought an encounter with Lanoth fight to the finish
He would never give me that opportunity
But now while am on mission of this sort he brings the fight to me ear tore at Miriams heart with icy fingers
The young womans nerves burning like redhot wires were at the breaking point under the severe mental burden that had been imposed upon her
She slumped listlessly back into her seat suddenly deciding to place her faith blindly in the ironclad creature at the pilot controls before her
Deceleration the Wanderer an nounced
Brundage hastily affixed elasti bar nesses about Miriam and himael The child required no attention
ne she was suspended on all sides
Vibration of the stern ceased
Then abruptly
ilranr fet her frail body surge fcrwiri arans the supporting straps as me braking rockets flamed nt ie
WANDERER OF THE VOID Miriam stared out at Lanoths ship which had now ranged much closer
The craft had cut propulsion rockets and was braking fiercely nosing downward for landing on Pluto
Wind shrieked about the hull of the Wanderers vessel as it hurtled into Plutos frigid atmosphere
The Wanderer regulated the gravitation reactor accordingly
They soon dropped to jarless landing upon an iceincrusted plain near the penal in stitute
The Wanderer brought out space helmets and oxygenerators from locker in the ships nose
As you know Plutos atmosphere at night is but slightly above abso lute zero he said
You will need these to protect your lungs against the extreme cold
There is small one to accommodate the child
All are fitted with shortdistance cosmic ray transmitting and receiving appa ratus The Wanderer placed helmet about the head of each of his passen gers started the oxygenerators saw that the communicating devices were functioning properly
The Wanderers voice boomed in Miriams ears
require no space gear for my self he said as if in answer to the question she had been about to voice
My helmet is sufficient The girl looked at him and won dered
There will be fighting perhaps and you will need weapon The Wanderer looked at Brundage and in dicated rack of guns on the far wall
Brundage selected side arm and long gun provided himself with am munition
The Wanderer inspected the brace of Wauxum highpressure pistols that hung in clip holsters at his own waist
Miriam and Brundage donned their fur garments and the young woman took the child in her arms
They then followed the iron man into the airlock and paused at the quartz win dow in the exit port
Lanoths ship was just settling down some hundred or more yards away the flame from ier under jets blasting out wide berth in the ice plain
It would be best for you to remain on the ship the Wanderer told Miriam
He opened the lock and he and Brundage stepped down upon the ice
Miriam closed the port behind them pressed her face close to the windov her heart thumping madly against her ribs
The dark Plutonian night was bit terly cold hazy with drifting flakes of congealed and frozen atmosphere
Overhead stars glittered with sort of frigid jewellike splendor adding touch of eeriness to the frozen world below
Miriam jerked nervously at the burst of white illumination that sud denly came from the pirate ship
She could now see plainly her father and the Wanderer striding purposefully across the ice crystals
port in the great ship opened and spaceclad man whom Miriam in stantly knew to be Lanoth leaped out
The young woman shuddered almost Overwhelmed with nausea at sight of the reptilian horde that poured out of the lock behind the pirate leader
ALF man half crocodile they ap peared to be walking upright upon their short stubby hindlegs their long horny tails sliding upon the ice
single large eye set in the center of their foreheads glowed with baleful luminosity
They leaped and cavorted about Lanoth brandishing weapons grasped in their webbed hands
They wore no space suits for they were inhabitants of planet far more frigid than Pluto
Lanoth waved them back and start ed walking toward the Wanderer
The two men halted facing each other at distance of thirty feet
Brun dage was to the left and slightly back of the Wanderer bis long gun held in readiness
The communicating device in Mir iams helmet brought their conversa tion to her
Ho Wanderer
We meet at last Yes Lanoth we meet
But not at time to my liking
have on board my ship child vho is at the very THRILLING WONDER STORIES threshold of death
Her life is meas ured in minutes unless Dr Vacor the prison surgeon takes her in charge immediately
Let me pass with she and her mother and give you my word shall return What care if the child dies Lanoth snarled
You are indeed dull of wit
Wanderer if you do not realize that this situation is little short of perfect for the fulfillment of my plans
shall cancel the old charge against Brundage as well as the one against you Miriam saw her father surge for ward heard him rasp Damn your black soul Lanoth
Ill gun flashed in the hand of rep tile man
Brundage spun slumped to the ice lay still
The Wanderer fell into crouch came up with mechanical precision flaming gun grasped in each of his metal hands
Lanoth gave ground before the terrible fusillade
He had not been able to match the Wander ers lightning double draw
But now his guns were out and up blasting forth the hatred of their owner
The Wanderer his own guns jerk ing viciously marched steadily for ward into the blazing death that hur tled at him from the hands of his ad versary
Behind Lanoth the reptile men held their fire fearful of strik ing their leader
Crouching beside the window in the little space ship Miriam Garth heard the clang of bullets against the hel mets and armor of the men on the snow plain before her felt the vibra tion as missiles struck the hull of the vessel
Brundage was moving now was getting on his feet
He had only been stunned by the bullet
The helmet had saved him
He brought up his rapidfire long gun brought it to bear upon Lanoths followers pressed the trigger
But the pirates closed in upon him slow ly inexorably despite the menace of his gun
Lanoth and the Wanderer were close together now still blazing away at each other
Miriam marveled that either of them had survived the with ering fire from the others guns
La noth began to weave about from side to side
And then the Wanderer dropped to one knee
Up Miriam shrieked into the little microphone in her helmet
Get up
Wanderer The Wanderer shook his head as if to clear his brain got slowly and wearily back to his feet
He took de liberate aim and his left gun spat once at the pirate leader
Lanoth stag gered the weight of his guns swung his limp arms to his sides and he crashed to the ice in crumpled heap
The reptile men came forward in rush
Miriam was about to turn from the window when suddenly from out of the darkness in the direction of the penal institute there charged more than hundred spaceclad giants some swinging huge swords above their heads others firing Wauxum guns rapidly as they ploughed through the frosty ice dashing straight toward the band of half men
Some of the pirate crew sought to escape by fleeing into their ship
But their line was quickly broken hacked to pieces by flickering doubleedged swords blasted out of existence by guns in capable hands
Soon it was all over
Out there on the ice lay the members of Lanoths inhuman crew
None lived save those who had sealed themselves in the pi rate ship
ope blossomed anew in Mir iams heart
Guards from the prison had come to the Wanderers aid had defeated the pirates and made it possible for Janice to be taken on to Dr Vacor
Perhaps it was not yet too late Suddenly Lanoths ship shot up ward at an angle stern first with half her underjets working
The big ves sel rolled and pitched her banks of keel rockets firing intermittently
The surviving reptile men were mak ing desperate effort to take off from Pluto
Evidently unskilled hands were at the pilot controls
The roar of cross talk in Miriams phone ceased abruptly
An author WANDERER OF THE VOID tative voice spoke crisply in the Plu tonian tongue
Then as the pirate craft nosed skyward under power of its propulsion rockets thin line of green flame lanced up from the roof of the prison
Two glononite shells exploded with fierce white glare against the for ward hull of the laboring space ship
third tore away her jets
She rolled over slowly folded nose upon stern and plunged downward seared and twisted mass of wrecked metal to final resting place in the bleak moun tain range that fanged the eastern sk
Space piracy in the Universe had ended Miriam knew with the de struction of that mighty ship
The Wanderers crusade was finished and the iron man could now unmask re veal his identity and retire to life of peace and quiet
Who was the Wanderer
And what was the grudge that Lanoth had harbored against Walter Brundage
Brundage the Wanderer and two of the guardsmen approached the lit tle ship
They were coming to take Janice on to the prison hospital to Dr Vacor
What would Janice find there life
Yes possibly
Life in the form of an encephalitic lethargy that would drift ultimately into death Miriams taut nerves gave way
The young woman fainted slid slowly to the floor still tightly clasping her unconscious child to her bosom
Later Miriam Garth opened her eyes in the prison hospital
She was on long examining table and Dr Yedell Vacor was bending over her
The huge physician offered small vial filled with thick yellow liquid
She swallowed the drug and immedi ately felt new life surge through her veins
Vacor smiled said Our roof look out observed your encounter with the pirates and we sent guardsmen to your assistance
They brought you here
Your daughter is safe in the room with her father She has she regained conscious ness Vacors face clouded
She has not Mistress Garth
It is case that baf fles me
Her condition is the same as her fathers and have been able to do nothing for him other than to keep him alive with intravenous injections of concentrated food and to take pre cautions against the collapse of his digestive system through disuse What is the nature of his illness Miriam asked
Three years ago Earth time said Vacor when your husband came to serve his sentence in this prison ha made most unusual request
He asked to be placed in chamber that had been specially insulated with certain combination of metals
Daniel Garth was scientist of prominence not man with criminal record so as superintendent of the institution consented
knew he had sufficient reasons
Shortly after his entrance here he fell into stupor and physical degen eration set in rapidly
The latter ceased immediately however when he was placed in the insulated room
have kept life in him but have failed to restore him to consciousness for one small instant
He is not dis eased he has fallen before the influ ence of some strange electrical ema nation the nature of which cannot understand
Neither can discover its source
Your daughter is in the room with her father
Perhaps some day they will recover completely
do not know iriam tugged at the physi cians sleeve
You have not told me everything Doctor she exclaimed her voice edged with hysteria
thing like this could not just happen
know that this wave of electrical energy has been intentionally directed against Daniel and Janice by some intelligent being some person who wishes to destroy them both
And if they are securely shielded from the wave why do they not regain con sciousness
You have formed some theory Doctor
You must tell me You are correct
Mistress Garth in your assumption that deliberate THRILLING WONDER STORIES attempt has been made upon the lives of your husband and daughter
have definitely established that fact
The prison cosmic ray engineers have registered the emanation on their de tectors but the wave is of such an in finitely high frequency that their in struments are not sufficiently sensi tive to indicate the direction from whence it comes But you have not explained why they do not regain consciousness Vacor spoke slovly
Indeed have not
And find it the most dif ficult of all explanations
am medical man not scientist well versed in electrodynamics or cosmic ray radiation so shall make the situ ation as clear to you as possibly can
The human body as well as any given amount of matter vibrates at certain frequency peculiar to its own size weight and chemical composi tion
To subject human body to wave whose frequency is the same as its own would bring about number of physical changes
The brain would be most disastrously affected since it is the seat of the senses
The fierce upheaval of the identical frequencies beating together would almost in stantly obliterate the mind drive out the ego the intelligence
Next there would follow general breaking down of the vital organs There was deathlike pallor upon Miriams face and her voice sounded hollow in the great room
Then the minds of Daniel and Janice have been utterly destroyed Not destroyed Vacor said but released from their bodies He mo tioned toward the darkness beyond the window
They are out there perhaps or in this very room with us
We do not know cannot know unless they return to their bodies
Let us hope they do so Miriam pondered the immensity of the thought
It was beyond credence
Human intelligences torn from their fleshy garments to be hurled naked out into eternity
Where else
Drifters in time and space
Would they ever return to their bodies or was there some unknown and immu table physical law that would pre vent At this point Walter Brundage came to the table
Lanoth has regained consciousness and wishes to make statement before he dies he said
The Wanderer wants you as witness Doctor They crossed the large room and entered small operating cell in the surgery department on the left
The Wanderer and prison physi cian stood at either end of metal table on which there lay broad shouldered young Earthman
The dying man turned his head slightly so that his failing eyes might bear upon the newcomers
Miriam Garth gasped
Why she faltered why its Jean
Jean Gossard
cant believe it Yes Miriam the whitefaced man on the table murmured Jean Gos sard your childhood playmate is Bors Lanoth the pirate
make this statement so that may find some measure of peace in death Lanoth or Gossard coughed blood bubbling on his lips
Dr Vacor administered stimulant
The pirate rested moment then went on As you know Miriam Daniel Garth and both loved you when we were youngsters on Earth
You cared only for Daniel
This caused me to hate him to hate you to hate even your father
Neither of you ever sus pected it for guarded my secret closely
My hatred flamed higher when Daniel finished his science course at the university with high honors while failed miserably
Something happened to my mind do not know what and swore to make each of you pay dearly for what then considered great wrong
TOOK space ship to Venus and there joined band of pi rates
Using the name Bors Lanoth eventually became their leader and built up powerful organization
It is not necessary to recount our deeds now
They are well known to you
When denexium was discovered on Merthel and your father went WANDERER OF THE VOID there Miriam to supervise personally the mining felt that my revenge was close at hand
And when you and Daniel joined him it was who took the cargo of denexium which Daniel Garth was accused of stealing
worked out the false evidence that convicted him
He is innocent pained expression twisted the features of Walter Brundage
He bowed his head
should have known it he mut tered
am sorry Miriam Miriam placed her cheek against her fathers shoulder took his big hand in her small ones
Lanoths words came again in whisper And it was who subjected Daniel to the ray that forced his intelligence from his body
But did not direct wave against his daughter
She after attaining certain age and size and being the child of Daniel Garth and consequently of similar chemical construction became affected by harmonic of the fundamental wave from my transmitter
She became at tuned in much the manner as we in order to escape etheric noises and dis tortion adjust our visigraph receiv ers to harmonic of the transmitting station Why did you not transmit this wave against Garth early in his year of bonded freedom Vacor asked
wished to greatly Lanoth re plied feebly because feared he would trace the stolen denexium to its buyer on Mars
But did not per fect my transmitter until the latter part of the year
Then mmch experi mentation was necessary in order to determine the natural wave length of his body Where is this transmitter Brun dage demanded
It was destroyed with my ship
There is no longer an emanation La noth turned his head slightly
Now Wanderer you have vanquished me
The the universe is waiting to learn your identity
Tell them as you promised
And And Jean Gossard alias Bors La noth the pirate was dead
But the Wanderer said nothing
He was leaning against the wall for sup port his arms hanging motionless at his sides the red glow in his electric eyes dimming rapidly
Miriam suddenly remembered that she had seen him shot down in his battle with the pirate
The Wan derer is wounded she cried
La noth shot him will attend him Vacor ex claimed
As Vacor started toward the Wan derer young physician dashed into the room
Vacor he said breathlessly
Daniel Garth and the child are re gaining consciousness
Come quick ly With glad cry Miriam ran past the young doctor and out of the room
Brundage and Vacor supporting the Wanderer between them followed
weak and slightly emaciated Daniel Garth sat on the side of his cot smiling
Miriam flung herself into her husbands arms tears of glad ness streaming dovn her cheeks
Daniel she choked
Garth spoke soft words of greet ing
Little Janice who sat on the cot beside her father said That was bad old dream had daddy Brundage and Vacor came in with the limp heavy body of the Wanderer sagging between them
Both spoke heartily to Garth
Daniel Garth laughed
Do not concern yourselves further with that heap of metal he said
Toss it into corner
have finished with it The two men stared
What do you mean Vacor asked quickly suspiciously
mean said Garth that you are burdening yourselves with an inani mate object Brundage turned to Vacor
Perhaps his brain is not yet clear he said
ARTH laughed again
My mind is perfectly clear assure you
will explain
built that robot in my laboratory on Merthel some years ago
synthesized brain which THRILLING WONDER STORIES placed in its skull
The auditory nerves are connected with the micro phones that serve as ears the optical nerves with the retinascopic photo electric cells and the nerves of speech with the reproducer
The motor nerves Doctor are con nected with the mechanism that acti vates the robots body delicate relays making and breaking the different cir cuits in the course of motivation
Power comes from small almost in exhaustible battery of my own design
The brain is nourished by certain fluid pump circulates through it ACOR and Brundage placed the robot in chair
It is marvelous Vacor murmured
do not fully understand how the synthetic brain am coming to that Garth went on
Years ago on Earth Jean Gos sard Bors Lanoth and experi mented with high frequency wave which we hoped would release the hu man intelligence from the body
We obtained little success and gave up
On Merthel experimented further wishing to liberate my own intelli gence so that might project it into the brain of the robot
Then was convicted of stealing cargo of denexium and was forced to give up my laboratory work
To ward the latter part of my year of bonded freedom traced the denex ium to certain buyer in Dotho Mars
secreted myself in this buyers ware house several times and gained much information
learned that it was Lanoth who had stolen the stuff and made it appear that was the thief
further learned that Lanoth was about to loose secret wave against me
The pirate was aware of my ef fort to trace the metal and he did not want me to prove my innocence
Peculiar physical symptoms which experienced later indicated that La noth had started transmitting his wave
The symptoms disappeared be fore had suffered to any great ex tent only to return at regular intef vals for several days
Then they ceased
The realiaation suddenly came to me that this was the sanie ray with which Gossard and had experiment ed on Earth
Lanoth then must be Jean Gossard
And he was seeking to find the natural wave length of my body
Soon he would be successful
With only few days of liberty remaining to me hastened to Mer thel changed the appearance of my space ship placed the robot on board and hid the ship in mountain range near Brundage City
Then came here to start serving my sentence and requested the insulated room
want ed Lanoths ray to release my intelli gence but wished my body shielded against physical deterioration
When the ray forced out my in telligence shall call my intelli gence entered the brain of the robot and started warfare against Lanoth and piracy in general
too perfected ray transmitter and incor porated it in the body of the robot in order that might project my ego out of the synthetic brain when nec essary
released my intelligence tonight just after Lanoth died and my in telligence went out to assist Janices drifting ego back into her little body
You have heard Lanoths statement now with mine you have clear pic ture of the whole affair Walter Brundage stepped forward
My boy he said huskily do not know what to say about the part took in prosecuting you
What can do Erase it from your memory Garth told him
The thunder of Vacors voice filled the room

At his back towered the observatory with its mammoth telescope
Below the balcony rough rocky clifs fell away to meet the restless sea which rolled and tossed fretfully
He swept the vast panorama before him with lidless eyes
From this prominence the country was visible for miles
Off to one side in the dis tance loomed jagged peaks
On one of these stood power plant an en ergy radiator one of the countless broadcasters which dotted Earth in the portions still inhabited by men
The man if such he could be called gazed into the darkening heavens
Behind the observatory the sun hung low in the sky
It had been that way for several hours its slow movement barely perceptible
Earths rotation was many times slower after five mil lion years
Mernoq himself represented an amazing spectacle
He was man whom his ancestors of five million years before would have disowned as an incredible monster
Given lati tude of fifty thousand centuries evo lution had worked strange pranks on mankind
The biped which had held reign over Earths dominions for the greater share of his long varied ex istence was much unlike his predeces sors of the remotely distant mechani cal age
Was it fate coincidence or domi nating undying spark which had seen Mankind Speeds Beyond the Stars to Flee
EXODUS By NEIL JONES Author of Little Her cules The Jameson Satellite etc
mankind triumphant over all obstacles which had beset his path
Since the mechanical age man had alternately scaled the heights of Utopia and had tasted the dregs of chaos and degene ration
Oblivions stark shadow had fallen often across the portals of civ ilization yet the human race had proved itself undying
Years of worldly strife had come and gone insect scourges had threat ened and nearly won pestilence had waved its grimy scepter throughout the Solar System and there had been interplanetary warfare
Worst of all there had come invasion by space wanderers creatures from the faroff stars nearly invincible and equally as threatening
Mankind on its plan ets and moons of the Solar System had suffered enslavement
Only by the The weird cavalcade Bled inside the illuminated chamber destruction of Venus entire atmos phere had mankind destroyed the in the Lifeless Solar System of the Fyfyre THRILLING WONDER STORIES vaders
This had happened long ago yet the Earthmen remembered
Mernoq was typical Earthman
He stood between four and five feet in height
Standing upright on two legs which were jointed to move in either of two directions he had four arms two on each side each member terminating in eight fingers
The legs were much longer than the body
During the last hundred thousand years or more the body had grown smaller due to the increasing diminu tion and final disappearance of the di gestive tract and organs of respira tion
To keep alive humanity no longer found it necessary to eat and breathe
Science had supplanted the compara tively short existence of the gastric organs with more practical means of austenance
Mans radioactive blood was kept charged with energy from the huge broadcasting units
Oxygen was superfluous
In this manner the life span had been materially in creased until life of ten thousand years had become common
The head of Mernoq had neither mouth nor nostrils
Like the appen dix of man the unused mouth had finally disappeared
Food no longer existed and articulate speech had long since yielded to mental telepa thy
On either side of the head were slightly elongated ears curved to catch the slightest of sounds
Two black lidless eyes peered intently from the face intelligence radiating from their depths
Humanity had done away vith sleep
Like food and oxygen it vas no longer necessary
The energy broadcasters recharged the body constantly
Hair that telltale mark of barbar ism had become unknown among Earthmen
Instead of hair there arose from the head fully two dozen anten nae
These served double purpose
They picked up the thought waves of their fellowmen and also received the broadcasted energy which supplied their bodies
Mernoq stood looking at the distant broadcaster which threw pink waves of light in every direction
From this station he and the members of the ob servatory staff received the energy their bodies required
Reception ex cept in the case of the more powerful broadcasters was limited to thou sand miles or less
number of broadcasters in jE
one vicinity varied in accordance with the amount of population
There were few spots on Earths surface vhere one stood in danger of starva tion
Turning Mernoq entered the ob servatory climbing few short steps to where several of his companions were grouped about table
Upon it stood intricate machines
Several of the Earthmen were gazing at large screen upon which the great telescope projected what it saw
large pair of fiery stars occupied the center of the field
Mernoq spoke mentally
The antennae of his comrades quiv ered slightly in attentiveness
The long night will soon be upon us with its terrible coldness
Then we must retreat into the sealed cham bers Sirius is nov nearing the zenith Eloow indicated the bright double star with wave of his arm
It is time that Uljoph returned said one of the others
He has been gone over thirtyfive years on his ex pedition to the twin suns of Sirius rumor has come to me said Mernoq
Do not yet fear that the expedition has become lost in space
Perhaps tonight our telescope may pick up the returning space ship rumor wnat have you heard Manipulating set of controls at his side Eloow looked up inquiringly into the face of Mernoq
The rest watched the screen eagerly
Sirius dimmed away into the distance as the telescopic field was brought closer to Earth
Vacuum yawned blackly at them
Black and empty Reod ex claimed
Mernoq remained silent in spite of this gloomy remark
He was think ing deeply
Earth was dying planet
space expedition had been sent to Alpha Centauri in an effort to find planet outside the dead Solar System THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS to which mankind might migrate
Al pha Centauri was found to possess sixteen planets none of them how ever suitable for habitation
The ex pedition to Sirius had immediately followed
We shall wait five years more said Mernoq and then another ex pedition will start out for still an other star But where It has not been definitely decided
Many of the nearer stars have been suggested
But we shall give this ex pedition time to prove itself
Both Uljoph and Aamon are among the best commanders of the Earthmen Why didnt you go yourself in stead of Aamon
He has always seemed bitter against you for your unparalleled success especially be cause the Earthmen have placed their faith and reliance in you to lead them know Mernoq replied
That is the very reason sent him
gave him the chance to distinguish himself along with Uljoph
Aamon is men tal genius and should be encouraged What of tonight Eloow wanted to know
You said you had had word We have observed nothing with our telescope replied Mernoq
The observatory at Yigni however has sent me strange reports
As you are probably aware they not only have the most powerful telescope in the world but the most erratic one
They have sacrificed clarity for greater magnification
received report from Bralel who is stationed there
He reports seeing flash of the expe ditions space ship returning from Sirius
The vision blotted and faded
He gave me his telescopic figures
If those at Yigni really saw the space ship coming home calculated that it would show up on our screen either today or else tonight his information acted as balm for the impatience of the Earth men
But fully two months were to elapse before the space ship actually arrived
Radio communication at that distance was impossible
Civili zation waited expectantly and anx iously
Failure had crowned previ ous effort
Optimism however ruled to such marked extent that partial preparations had been made for de parture from Earth
The laboratories and workshops were kept busy
One Question was uppermost in the minds of all
Had Uljoph and Aamon found perfect world in the system of Siri us or had failure fallen upon the Earthmen once more
And then one day the ship arrived plumbing Earths waning atmosphere at greatly reduced speed
Out of it poured the forces of Uljoph and Aamon
They were unusually jubi lant and seemed glad to be among their own kind once more after de parture of three and half decades
They immediately joined Mernoq
Why did you not radio he asked them
Our proximity with Sirius de stroyed many vital parts of our send ing apparatus but we heard your mes sages before entering the Solar Sys tem Uljoph replied
it will be necessary to construct our sending apparatus on different principles when we return once more within the influence of Sirius stated Aamon
Return echoed Mernoq
Then you have been successful We have was the enthusiastic reply
it was colorful story which Uljoph related
After fifteen years of space flight they had reached Sirius dis covering that it possessed twenty seven planets
The planets varying in size presented varying conditions
Many of them had moons
Commenc ing from the innermost planet the Earthmen had explored them all even to the outermost world distantly re moved from the dazzling orbs of Sirius
Two worlds had been found to be ideal
They were the sixth and eighth planets
The seventh world was habitable but was overrun with rank vegetation and loathsome forms of life
Zyse the sixth planet was much to be preferred
Bexn the eighth world teemed with animal life
THRILLING WONDER STORIES boasting strange race of intelligent creatures
Zyse was by far the most beautiful world of the entire system
We must desert this wornout world said Mernoq
The vanguard of our people will soon start for Zyse But there must be more prepara tions made Aamon argued
We cannot start at once Mernoq saw with disappointment that Aamons attitude was antagonis tic
He saw enmity in his glance the enmity which Mernoq hoped he would have lost on the trip to Sirius
The great leaders reply however was conciliatory
Yes preparations are indeed nec essary before the greater share of us leave for the new world he admit ted
Yet during your absence our optimism led us to construct many space ships
vast fleet of them is equipped and ready now on Mars No
do not intend leaving for the new system until the last con tingent goes
That will be long time yet
shall go with the last ships which are to carry the valuable kletin metal now stored on Venus Months later the waiting space ships on the planet Mars headed for Zyse
They were the forerunners of the exodus the first ships to leave the old System
From that time on ships continually left for the new home planet until several years later there were but few left
Strangely enough Aamon showed no desire to head contingents to Zyse
Mernoq was glad for Aamon was valuable and seemed to have got over his old envy
CHAPTER II Beneath the Monolith HEARTH had become nearly aban doned as Mernoq and two hun dred of his men stood on the desolate planet Venus
The suns huge globe hung just at the edge of the horizon
Venus had ceased rotating
One side forever faced the sun red hot hem isphere
The other side frozen cold by the temperature of space lay dark and as equally deserted
The atmosphere was gone ter rific war with the invaders from distant star had destroyed the en velope of air ripped open fissures in the planet released the inner ele ments and had blown the cruel invad ers into eternity
Venus was as dead and deserted as Earths moon or Mars
Stars shone crystal clear all about the sun gleam ing and twinkling
In space suits the forces of Mernoq walked over the cold surface of the planet
Mernoq had brought the space ship to rest upon the narrow thousand mile strip of shadowland between the cold and flaming hemispheres of the dead world
Mernoq now gave instruc tions to Aamon
Stay with the ship while we de scend into the underground chambers after the kletin metal
Be sure that the energy broadcaster continues to function properly
We shall be back shortly Enclosed in the bulky space suits with their multitude of exterior ap paratus the Earthmen headed for tall monolith rising from clump of rocks which strewed its base
Reod shone peculiar ray of green inten sity from his space suit upon the broad base of the tover
Almost im mediately doorway opened
In long line the weird cavalcade filed inside and down broad flight of steps into large chamber
The walls glowed radiating an ethereal light of their own
In the center of the chamber stood massive machine its various parts formed of intricate apparatus
This was the auxiliary energy broadcaster to be used in case the one on the space ship failed or in the event that the space ship was moved away from the vicinity
The sides of the vast cham ber were pierced with small doorways leading to the storerooms of the kle tin
When charged with peculiar force of light produced by the Earth men this metal furnished gravity for the floors of space ships
It was to be found in large quantities upon the planet Uranus and the Earthmen had mined considerable of it on this far THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS planet and moved it to Venus for storage
In groups the Earthmen entered the storerooms and started the remov al of the kletin
Mernoq saw one of the Earthmen walk toward him with load in his four arms
It was Ibaeg and his action seemed strange one
Others were also emerging from the storerooms with the metal but with the exception of Ibaeg they were all heading for the broad stairway lead ing to the surface
Ibaeg where are you taking that The man made no reply but hurried his pace
He ran straight for the en ergy broadcaster
Mernoq and his subordinates were standing at the op posite end of the machine
Ibaeg was approaching from the other side
Sensing trouble of some sort Uljoph hurried toward Ibaeg seeking to in tercept him
But he was not quick enough
Striding up to the dormant energy plant Ibaeg threw with all four arms his load of metal into the mechanism
There came crashing note of twisted parts
ernoq stared aghast at this strange action uncomprehend ing
The miscreant legged it for the flight of stairs those near him too surprised to think of pursuit
Be sides Aamon and more of the Earth men were in the space ship outside
Ibaeg could not escape
His action had been that of madman
It was seemingly pointless
At the foot of the stairs Uljoph stopped and stared upward
Are you mad he demanded
Ibaeg made no reply
He was near ly to the doorvay vhich led from the monoliths base when terrific roar shook the subterranean chamber
Then came mighty concussion as if gigantic body had thudded against the ground far above
With fright ful crash and billowing accompani ment of dust great white boulder svept Ibaeg off his feet and beneath it rolling dovm the stone steps grinding them to powder and smash ing into the rocky wall
Uljoph leaped out of the way just in time
The curtain of rock dust spread like veil as large pieces fell from the fractured wall blocking the up ward passage completely
The monolith has fallen ex claimed Reod
He stared at the ruins in dismay
There was an explosion All became quiet
The rock dust settled slowly
For moment the Earthmen surveyed the clogged pas sage in mental silence
Not square foot of opening was left
They were sealed as if in tomb
We must signal Aamon
He can dig us out with disintegrators call was sent out to Aamon
The reply which came back jarred the sen sibilities of the Earthman worse than had the strange action of Ibaeg or the succeeding explosion of the monolith
Mernoq your reign is at an end came his vindictive thought waves
Ibaeg did his work well
The broad caster is broken and you are en tombed
When leave for Earth you will all die
shall be free to build my own empire in the new sys tem of planets But my men have loyal men aboard ship exclaimed Mernoq more out of surprise and consterna tion than contradiction
Dead Mernoq all dead just as you shall soon be gloated Aamon
My supporters are many
now re turn to Earth where shall set time explosion to detonate the Earths at mosphere in the same manner em ployed by the Earthmen who de stroyed the atmosphere of Venus ages ago You are mad Aamon shall be safe far beyond the So lar System when the cataclysm takes place
When reach Zyse shall conquer the Martian vanguard of ships and all other ships which have left since then
alone shall be all powerful
Now die Mernoq you and all your puppets Mernoq looked around at his com panions who were stricken dumb by the rapid succession of events all planned so well by the evil genius of Aamon
In each others eyes they read the agreement of the certain doom to befall them
The space ship contain ing the source of their sustenance
THRILLING WONDER STORIES was gone
The auxiliary plant in the chamber where they stood was wrecked
Their situation was truly desperate
have two hours in which to live was Mernoqs quiet yet deadly ultimatum
We may be able to repair the damage which Ibaeg did but unless we hurry such re pairs Several of the Earthmen who were skilled mechanics set to work on the damaged broadcaster
They worked steadily removing the damaged parts and repairing them
Time moved by
An insidious sensation of weakness commenced creeping over the Earth men
Suddenly one workman swayed diz zily
Another workman sprang to the task taking the place of his fallen comrade
Mernoq experienced strong urge to sit down
His legs seemed no longer capable of holding his body upright
He fought desper ately against this urge
When his knees sagged he was promptly caught in the arms of companion who eased him gently to the floor
The time he inquired
How long have we Less than half an hour for most of us was the grim reply
few of us may last even longer than that Mernoq felt himself lapsing into unconsciousness
Fully threequar ters of the Earthmen had weakened and fallen
Some retained their senses yet were too feeble to move
The lack of energy was making itself felt
The the lever came the weak mental communication from one of the Earthmen who staggered to the machine with the two remaining parts
Two of his companions weaved in the direction of the starting lever while the other stood at his side to assist him
Behind them Mernoq rose weakly upon his four hands
strong sub conscious prompting had returned him to consciousness
He seemed un able to rise
He watched Cyponom reach for the lever with one hand his remaining three arms clinging to va rious nearby portions of the machine to support his sagging body
Yxlese reeled helplessly against his fellow mechanic dropping the re maining bit of apparatus in its place
The piece had only to be fastened
Yxlese reached out weakly to give the necessary twist
His arms stiffened and never reached the mechanism for his supporting comrade fell Yxlese slumping across his inert body
Through haze of semiconscious ness Cyponom watched Mernoq crawl forward through an effort of tremen dous will power reach the machine and pull himself slowly upward
dizzy mist obscured the vision of Cy ponom
When it cleared he saw Mernoq sag backward and hit the floor
Cyponoms heart sank
At the last vital moment failure had mocked them
He was the only one left with his senses part of them and they were rapidly leaving him
He clung tight but seemed too weak to hang on any longer
He felt his grip weak ening
His eyes wandered to the part which Mernoq had made one final ef fort to reach and turn
His heart skipped beat
It was fastened
Mernoq had reached it
darkness overwhelmed Cyponom
The final or der from his brain commanded three reluctant arms to drop their holds and seize the lever which the other arm held with its eight fingers
As Cyponom fell the weight of his body pulled the lever
grinding noise issued from the machine
Pink vibrations of light danced from the apparatus forming shimmer of color around it
Strewed about the vast chamber lay nearly two hundred un conscious Earthmen many of them close to death
CHAPTER III Entombed he broadcaster roared into ac tion
Soon the reviving Earth men their antennae picking up the energy from the waves which pene trated their space suits commenced to rise THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS How much better off are we now lamented Reod
We are entombed We are alive returned Mernoq spiritedly and while life still exists within our bodies we may yet dare to hope The philosophy of Mernoq was sound
Upon this philosophy man kind had clung tenaciously to life throughout the ages in the face of ad versity
How are we to reach Earth with out space ships even if we do escape this place queried Uljoph
Reaching Earth is but half as im portant as sending out warning of Aamons treachery and his plans to explode the atmosphhere But we have no way of getting to Earth nor any way of signalling in time to forestall Aamons plan said Uljoph
have plan Mernoq told them desperate plan one depending upon close calculations and long chances but first we must get free of this place Mernoq would not divulge his hopes
First he said they must win through to the surface of Venus
The outlook was discouraging
On three sides solid rock surrounded them
The bowels of the planet lay beneath their feet while overhead lay heavy strata of mantle rock
The avenue before them was blocked with massive fragments of the great monolith in terspersed with rock debris from the cracked walls of the passage
once heard of secret exit from this place said Nenerm
Where is it do not know was the uncertain reply
These chambers are old
No one alive can remember when they were built
There is legend telling of an attempted escape of the space invaders long ago
group of them burrowed deep inside Venus
They were all destroyed by the earthquakes which followed the destruction of the atmosphere
passage from these caverns is supposed to lead through their secret exit Then why were these caverns not destroyed by the quakes asked Mernoq
That is what throws doubt on the truth of the legend replied Nanerm yet the legend exists Mernoq at once ordered his men to tap the rock walls in search of hol lows beyond
The Earthmen spread out into small groups searching care fully the adjoining storerooms as well as the central chamber
Both wall and floor space was nearly covered before an excited telepathic commu nication burned itself upon his brain
We have found it Mernoq and his subordinate officers hurried to the spot
Several of the Earthmen held back section of rock which balanced nicely on convex axis
dark passageway lay beyond
Uljoph advanced into it but Mernoq motioned him back
Let the stone swing into place he said
We must be sure that it is dependable and will open at the right time in case we must return this way he stone swung back
As Mer noq had feared the opening of the secret door had been gropingly accidental
After much experiment the concealed exit was reopened
combination of pressure movements on the nearby wall was necessary
Mernoq and his men took careful note of these
He was then satisfied to en ter
He detailed twenty of the Earth men to stay with the energy broad caster and keep it working properly
Watch it carefully
Our lives and yours depend upon it
We shall fol low this passage to the end
If we fail to reach the surface we shall re turn
If we win through we shall communicate with you when we ar rive back at the spot where the mono lith stood With these parting instructions Mernoq and the remainder of the Earthmen snapped on the glowing lights of their space suits and filed into the cavity out of sight around bend in the tunnel
The opening was closed softly behind them
They tramped for miles through the interior of Venus the tunnel slop ing gradually downward
Mernoq commenced to despair of ever reach ing the surface yet he was determined THRILLING WONDER STORIES to follov
the tunnel to its termina tion
It became warm excessively so
Although the surface of Venus was dead and cold the interior was not
The Earthmen became aware of this more than ever as the passage continued its downward slant
Then through the gloom ahead of them they saw the end of the subter ranean passage
It ended blankly yet as they approached nearer and their lights dispelled the shadows they saw faint square outlines of huge door
vague murmur beyond made them pause and grow apprehen sive
Mernoq broke the suspense by ordering it opened
Several of the Earthmen seized the huge metal pull shaking loose from it the dust of ages
No lock was in evidence
Constructed of stone and metal the door was massively built towering far above the height of the Earthmen who tugged at it
Con trary to the expectations of Mernoq however the door opened easily part ly of its own volition so it seemed as if it had waited patiently through the long centuries
Had the Earth men only known it the door had re mained closed for more than quar ter million years
black dust vomited forth from the doorway whirling and falling among the Earthmen
There followed rumble like thunderclap
Beyond the doorway lay vast cavern whose high walls threw back the red and green glow of lurid flames
To their startled eyes were revealed long tongues of fire shooting up to lick the ceiling
They were no such flames as the burning of oxygen might pro duce
The flames were red and termi nated in oval tips edged with blue green luminosity
Come Mernoq strode fearlessly in ie di rection of the raging inferno
His men followed
In warm palpable dust which rose nearly to their knees they walked slowly toward the brilliant fire which as they approached nearer they found issuing from broad deep crevice in the cavern floor
The internal fires of Venus never believed they came so close to the surface They stopped at the edge of the fife pit and looked across to where the cavern stretched away into the gloom
Dimly visible were several rocky corridors
Mernoq lingered for mo ment undecided as to directions but he saw that one end of the crevice might be skirted and ordered the cor ridors to be explored
They circled the flaming cauldron to see what lay beyond
Uljoph drew Mernoqs at tention to the cavern ceiling
was perfectly circular
The cav ern was not artificial
An intelli gence had constructed it
Was the legend true
Had the invaders fash ioned this place as tomb or hidea way or had mankind made their way to the internal fires long ago in the forgotten past
Mernoq wondered
They walked close to the ragged edge of the crevice and peered downward
The fiery hell was fully hundred yards across lurid flames obscuring the bottom
Hidden by the flames boiling inferno of molten rock gushed in and out of the planets interior
mental cry of terror issued from across the darting flames
The anten nae on Mernoqs head told him the directions from which the cry had come
Rapidly he and his compan ions circled the fire pit and raced into the corridor from which the cry had issued
Other Earthmen were excit edly milling about inside
In the center of the throng they came upon ghastly scene
Seven Earthmen lay dead mutilated their space suits crushed and ripped
The bodies had been torn to shreds
For moment in the horror of the situation no one saw the large boxes whose ends flanked the passage
They lay on shelves
Uljoph was first to discover them
He climbed over the side of one and looked down into the metal container
His mind ejaculated one thought
Empty Meanwhile others were examining more of the strange boxes
Reods warning came too late for long tentacle slid up over the side of container sharp metal claws embrac THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS ing an inquisitive and unsuspecting Earthman
Zougmre wriggled to free himself
monstrous body surmount ed by hideous head lifted up and more tentacles waved wildly menac ingly as the creature glared baleful ly at the surrounding Earthmen
Six snaky arms writhed from the black repulsive body protected by an artificial shell of metal
The tentacle ends were tipped with metal sharp ened to razoredged cutting power
head with an eye in front and an eye in back of the oval cranium turned from side to side
The eyes stared intently exuding cold crafty expression of intelligence
blunt snout sniffed inquisitively
Several of the nearer Earthmen sprang to the aid of their stricken comrade but it was too late
Three more tentacles curled themselves around the doomed man cutting his body to pieces
Get out of here quick urged Mernoq
We are powerless to com bat them Down the corridors ambled five of the insidious creatures
More of them were emerging from the metal containers
The Earthmen raced to the comparative safety of the fire cavern
What are they The invaders exclaimed Mernoq
The things that conquered the Solar System ages ago
We thought them all dead Impossible deplored Reod
How could they have lived Suspended animation replied Mernoq whose astute mind had con ceived the truth of the situation
When we opened that door it re leased forces automatically which were necessary to bring them out of their sleep
Air machines were set to working too
There is air down here now lfiERNOQ pointed to the leaping flames which seethed outward from the pit the bluegreen lumin osity changing in color as it yielded to red and white heat
tremendous wave of hot air sent them scurrying backward making them aware of its warmth even throughtheir space suits
We are weaponless against them cried Uljoph
Mernoq realized this fact keenly
The space invaders were not only ar mored but doubtlessly possessed weapons too
Mernoq hurriedly led the way around the fire pit and into that black section of the cavern which lay ahead
He was hoping against hope
They must go that way and hope for continuance of the tunnel
To return the way they had come would ultimately mean finding them selves trapped
These thoughts flew swiftly among them
What of the twenty men we left with the energy broadcaster Uljoph suggested
Suppose they attack in that direction The tunnel rises that way
The air will die out in the upper levels But if their air machines generate more air The ominous question remained un ansvered as the Earthmen set out on run past the fire pit the increased heat of the flames driving them far to one side near the vall
Mernoqs apprehensions grew less as he saw ahead of them the continuation of the tunnel
He had begun to fear that the cavern marked the tunnels end
The Earthmen became weary after mile or more of rapid running
It was the desire of Mernoq to put goodly amount of distance between them and the hateful creatures of the fire cavern
The latter had suspend ed themselves in living death to bridge the ages with their menace
CHAPTER IV Subterranean Battle the satisfaction of the Earth men the tunnel struck steep in cline much steeper than the one they had recently descended on leaving the kletin storerooms
In some places steps had been cut because of the ten dency toward perpendicular ascent
The climb was long one
Soon they found that the air manufactured be low them was dying out
They were once more in the usual vacuum
The THRILLING WONDER STORIES lower levels had been left behind
They came to long flight of steps up which they climbed to find them selves in another large cavern
All around them lay water
They were on an island in subterranean lake
Their bright lights revealed shore lit tle more than hundred yards away
The island lay in nearly the exact center of the lake several hundred feet from shore
It bore evidences of having been purposely constructed
The water or fluid of the lake which was closely akin to water took on peculiar appearance to the eyes of the Earthmen
It appeared dull and with out lustre
This was due largely to lack of atmosphere
How can we cross queried Ul joph
We can hardly swim with our space suits If the water is not too deep cr the bottom is not full of holes we can walk across If we could but drain the lake down through the passage why Reods original idea vas lost in brilliant burst of inspiration
His sudden enthusiasm was shared by the rest
Drain the lake into the internal fires
Kill the monsters For moment Mernoq felt himself overwhelmed by the possibilities of the daring plan
In his minds eye he saw the waters of the lake rushing down the long tunnel filling the low er level and cascading into the molten pit of fire
There would be boiling chaos clouds of steam the long dor mant invaders scalded to death
His indecision was short
Cut channel The Earthmen set to work vith will rapidly cutting ditch from the lake to the orifice of the tunnel in the islands center
Luckily they pos sessed the rock picks which made up an essential part of their space suit equipment
Rapid headway was made for the rock was soft type peculiar to Venus
large group started working from the tunnel entrance while others worked up to their heads in water at the lakes edge their globed helmets rising out of the water only to disappear again
Mernoq sent one of his men to gauge the depth of the lake
The man walked out of sight the water swirling above his head
From time to time he radiated reports to his comrades above
His space helmet finally broke the surface of the water near the farther shore where their lights had revealed con tinuance of the tunnel
The lake was comparatively shallow
We can all walk across said Mernoq
When this water starts draining into the lower levels we must hurry warned Reod
Steam will be forced back this way What of those we left in the cham ber of the broadcaster Uljoph in quired
If the steam rises they will die too The steam will seek the nearest and easiest exit said Mernoq
Be sides remember the heavy stone blocking the entrance to the secret tunnel
It will resist tremendous steam pressure NE of the Earthmen made star fling discovery
Air is blow ing up the shaft
It is rising into this cavern It was true
strong current of air blew up the tunnel bringing thin veil of dust with it
Mernoq feared the coming of the interstellar invad ers
More atmosphere was being gen erated from the corridors leading off from the fire cavern
We must hurry Only thin slice of rock separated the two channels which were nearly converged
The Earthmen chopped madly with their picks
They had worked frantically in shifts only fraction of their number being able to work unhampered in the ditch
scout Mernoq had sent down the tun nel now returned
They are coming
They have weapons trickle of water burst over the lip of the tunnel leading from the island to the lower levels
The alarm spurred the laboring Earthmen to des perate measures in superhuman ef fort to send the lake rushing down the tunnel before their ancient ene THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS mies could emerge
Upon the rising current of air came deathly cry which the radiophone ears of the space helmets readily picked up
It was eerie and chilling like no sound the Earthmen had ever before heard
One of the terrible things they had unwittingly revived strode into view below them on short squat legs
In several of his long tentacles he car ried gleaming discs
The Earthmen stood at the top of the shaft with upraised picks the only weapons they possessed
These were crude indeed compared to the destructive weapons which Aamon had carried away on the space ship
Two of the pale disc beams fell on the nearer of the Earthmen focusing for but brief moment
round por tion of each space suit glowed red then disappeared
Underneath the flesh of the Earthmen shone ruddy hue iridescent sparks shedding themselves rapidlly
The unfortunate men fell dead while the discs of fire continued to burn completely through their bodies
The disc beams flicked upon others of the band
One of them staggered toward the water
Another sank to his knees beside the tunnel
Back he cried
With all four arms he brushed and struck madly at the glowing spot which ate through his space suit
Dont let them He rose suddenly and jumped down upon the advancing monster in des pairing leap as he felt the death ray eating swiftly into his vitals
His impetuous leap hurled back the inter stellar invader upon four or five more who came crowding up from behind
For moment all was confusion in the tunnel
Metaltipped tentacles hastened the death of the martyred man who had used his rapidly expir ing body to the greatest advantage
Extricating themselves from the tangle of bodies and tentacles the ter rible creatures of the fire pit scuffled up the shaft their disc rays waving wildly
deluge of rushing water met them hurling them backward
One survivor clung with his tentacles to the lip of the tunnel opening
With mighty strength he pulled himself out of the strong current
Fully hun dred picks hacked his tentacles as all four arms of the nearer Earthmen rose and fell
The dismembered body de void of anything with which to cling yielded to the strong pull of the cur rent
The shrieking head with its hateful venomous eyes disappeared beneath the cascading water the hor rid screeching muffled to frantic gurgle
or moment the Earthmen seemed rooted to the spot
Sev eral of their number lay dead victims of the disc beams
Yet the Earthmen had triumphed
Reod shook his head ruefully
fear for those we left in the chamber of the energy broadcaster We must get back to where the space ship landed said Mernoq
Then we shall learn if they are safe Directions were quickly found and they headed for the distant monolith which lay broken and wrecked be cause of the treacherous attempt Aamon had made to send them all into eternity
Even now unsuspecting hu manity upon the Earth prepared for further contingents of the exodus while Aamon was laying his plans
The thought urged Mernoq to great er haste
He had plan in mind
It was not long before the jagged remnants of the great monolith be came visible upon the horizon
The Earthmen hurried to the spot
Where the entrance to the subterranean chambers had been located was now but tumbled mass of rock
Mernoq sent out call to those they had left imprisoned in the kletin chambers with the energy broadcaster
It was answered
Their comrades were alive and the mechanism was functioning perfectly
How are we to communicate with Earth and warn them of Aamons treachery queried Reod
We have no equipment Do you realize what type of ex plosive Aamon employed in destroy ing the monolith Why yes
The explosive was an nite
recognized it when heard the blast THRILLING WONDER STORIES The mind of Mernoq still remained reservedly inscrutable
Annite he continued is queer explosive What do you mean Its destructive forces are tremen dous yet it has peculiar fault when exploded in space or upon planet which has no atmosphere Why yes fragments of it are gen erally blown off it and fail to ex plode Exactly
Mostly through lack of barometric pressure And what good will that do us asked Uljoph
In one of these large rocks we are going to hollow out crude form of rocket gun Mernoq explained
We shall charge it with the fragments of unexploded annite which is strewn about here on the ground In brief flash they recognized Mernoqs purpose
They were going to rocket warning to the Earth hop ing it would reach there in time to prevent the cataclysm which Aamon had planned
CHAPTER Rocket Messages REPARATIONS were hastily made
With their picks the Earthmen commenced fashioning rocket gun in the side of huge slab which faced away at the desired angle Mernoq wanted
For the construc tion of the rocket itself Mernoq searched among the ruins at the monoliths base for metal stanchions which had previously been built into the entranceway
It was here that he made discovery which he considered fortunate
There is sufficient metal to build three rockets for dispatch to Earth if we can gather annite to power all three Can we send message without its destruction when the rocket crashes against Earth Arrange parachutes to be released when the rockets hit Earths atmos phere suggested Uljoph
Or we may be able to fix reverse annite charges in various positions so that the increasing friction with Earths atmosphere will explode them and slow up the rockets speed By searching large part of the vi cinity where the explosion of annite had occurred the Earthmen gathered enough fragments to send off and equip with reverse charges all three of the rockets
Mernoq and his sub ordinate officers figured the mathe matical position of the two planets and their movements quite carefully also estimating the force of the an nite
The rockets would hit their target
It is long chance these rockets Uljoph said grimly
What if none of them are found or suppose they land in an ocean where tjfiey cannot be recovered In that case said Mernoq it will mean the destruction of Earths at mosphere and all human beings now on the planet You think that Aamon has done his work and departed for Zyse He has had time for it
Our only chance is to get word to them in time to charge the atmosphere with coun teracting gas One of Earths telescopes may dis cover our plight here suggested Reod
Space ships may be sent have been thinking the same said Mernoq yet it is probable that Aamon has ready story to tell es pecially in regard to the demolished monolith Each of the Earthmen measured THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS the possibilities and hoped the gages at the observatories on the Earth picked up the proximity and compo sition of all foreign objects entering Earths atmosphere
Some of the rockets would be traced and found
The question of timely arrival how ever vas uppermost in their minds
In spite of the terrific power and ac celerating impetus afforded by annite it would be long time before the projectiles reached Earth
Mernoqs order the Earthmen set off the first rocket
At long intervals the other two were sent into space
Off they hurtled in the direc tion of the greenglowing planet which glowed steadily in the sky
Earth and Venus were nearly in line and the suns position favored the Sight of the rockets
Time must pass time which battled with the time Aamon had set for the destruction of civilization
The rockets not only contained messages relating to Aamons perfidy but they also gave specific directions for charging the atmosphere
It was at Reods suggestion that an other chance of salvation was made possible
Mernoq employed this at once
On sloping wall facing the nlanet Earth messages were written in gigantic characters on the chance that Earth telescopes might be trained that way
Time dragged for the waiting Earthmen
close watch was kept upon the green star for the Earthmen were fearful of the telltale flash sur rounding the planet which would tell of Aamons success
The Earthmen knew that it would be long time before the stellar mes sages reached Earth great number of times longer than passage by space ship
Only few days had passed when one of the Earthmen issued mental cry of excitement which brought the general focus of attention immedi ately upon the green glowing planet vhich swung far off in space
Mer noqs heart chilled with fear
Had the gigantic cataclysm been unloosed at last
His keen eyes searched for the telltale glare of destruction
Instead he saw several bright specks growing larger in the sky
They expanded to view as they came and he saw that they were space ships
Five in number they cruised about the vicinity of the wrecked monolith finally settling to rest
The stranded Earthmen watched in undecided an ticipation
Was this help arriving or had Aamon returned to finish the sinister work which had narrowly failed him the first time
Several figures stepped from the nearest ship and approached them
Mernoq with gladness in his heart recognized one of them as Eloow
Earths atmosphere cried Mer noq voicing the apprehension upper most in his mind
Is it saved We do not yet know for certain but we hope for the best How did you get here so soon
We sent rockets but that was but few days ago We read your cliff message from our space ship said Eloow
We were already on our way here But Aamon where is he On his way to Zyse but it is small start he has
We left for Ve nus secretly almost at the starting moment of Aamons ship in the direc tion of Sirius
His course of flight has diverged only at slight angle from our own
was suspicious of him when he told how the monolith had been destroyed in blasting nec essary passage into the kletin cham bers
He reported that you and the others not returned with him had de cided to stay and move the kletin out upon the surface of Venus before more ships were sent for it fTHEN were these ships to wW come for us Mernoq asked
Sixteen Earthly days hence When Aamons destruction of Earths ai
was consummated and he was safely on his way out of the Solar System observed Mernoq
And you were found entombed and dead added Eloow
When our tele scope picked up the inscriptions you made on the cliff dispatched one of our ships back to Earth to take pre THRILLING WONDER STORIES yentative measures against Aamons reachery The formula for charging the air Mernoq interrogated eagerly
The formula so long preserved and which is entrusted to but ievf of us you Aamon and myself included
The same formula which our ancient an cestors used in keeping the exploding emanations from Venus atmosphere harmless when they struck the atmos phere of Earth Then our fears are at rest for Aamon would not have timed the ex plosion to occur before he had left the Solar System and you say that he has but short start That is so Aamon must never reach Zyse Mernoq avovied
It is unlikely that he shall re plied Eloow
have suspected him ior long time
never placed the trust and confidence in him that you did
On one reason or another held up most of the ships which were to leave with Aamon but could not manage to delay Aamon himself
did the next best thing
placed man aboard with orders to hamper the speed of his ship in case we wished to catch up Let us give chase at once Mernoq hurried with Eloow to his ship
Four ships rose from the cold dead surface of airless Venus and raced off into space
The remaining ship stayed while its occupants set to work releasing the score of impris oned Earthmen attending the energy radiator
The course of Aamons ship had led sunvard designed on straight course to Sirius which would cut close to the orbit of Mercury
Earthmen eagerly scanned the proximity detec tors as high speed was attained
The four ships spread out so that they cruised several thousand miles apart
They were nearing Mercurys orbit when the sunward ship of the group first picked up the location of Aamons slowermoving space ship
The four pursuing ships gradually converged
message was radiated for Aamon to stop
His answer was vicious blast of power which nar rowly missed the nearest ship of Eloows fleet
Aamon put on sudden spurt of speed
It was evident that Eloows minion who had been responsible for the slowing up of Aamons ship had been detected
That his end had been swift one neither Eloow nor Mer noq doubted
The four ships kept abreast of Aamons at safe distance
Another blaze of power went wide of its mark
Still another and much closer charge caused one of the pur suing ships to tumble crazily in space until it once more righted itself
Shall we fire asked Eloow turn ing to Mernoq
Mernoq nodded grimly
The order was communicated to all four ships
Simultaneously blasts leaped out at the fleeing craft
Two of them struck
They waited to see the extent of the damage
AMONS ship demolished at one end rolled awkwardly off its course still hurtling at meteoric speed
Mernoq and Eloow watched the proximity detectors
series of blasts from the spacewrecked craft lashed savagely and spitefully at its avengers
They were ineffectual yet revealed dangerous potentials which were still Aamons
Another barrage will finish him Mernoq halted in the act of issuing instructions as Eloow gripped his arm and pointed significantly at the proximity detector
Aamon has lost his propulsion power
He is falling into the sun
What end could be more fitting
We have only to stand by at safe dis tance and watch him go to well merited death Mernoq revised his orders to fire
Instead his ships formed funeral consort about the doomed and help less ship of his archenemy whom once he had trusted and encouraged
They cruised too far distant for Aamon to vent any further spite upon them although he made several vain attempts
Nearer and nearer the great flaming globe of the sun they raced the initial momentum of Aamons ship at the time he had been THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS struck swervingly diverted tovvard the suns incandescent mass
He had no power to change the course
The end was inexorable
So fast were the five ships moving through space that soon the ships of the fleet commenced to feel the tre mendous drag of the suns immense attraction
Aamons fall was accel erating
He and his faithless crew were consigned to flaming hell which would consume them long be fore they ever reached it
They were to die horrible linger ing death of suffocating heat watch ing tormented ly the sunward side of their space ship grow red then vhite hot before they perished miserably
Something of this inevitable doom must have impressed itself on Aamon for in the middle of the funeral cor tege the cosmic coffin with its living and doomed cargo burst suddenly into bright flash of light
Where slowmoving dot had rest ed on the proximity detectors there were now but few tiny specks slow ly radiating from central point
Aamon had chosen the easier way
No longer did he stand as menace to mankinds peace and security in the exodus to the new world

MILLION YEARS AHEAD Ross Sherilis Superman of Future Eons Knows but One Master Evolution
By EDMOND HAMILTON Author of The Comet Doom The Ac cursed Galaxy etc
he little ratfaced man looked fearfully at the mechanism in the corner of the lamplit labo ratory
It was like tall cylindrical cage of metal bars connected elec trically to the generators huge vacuum tubes and other apparatus in the room
He turned jerkily toward the other two people in the room
One was serious lanky young man the other girl whose soft face was pale and whose dark eyes held hooded appre hension
These two were Ross Sherill brilliant young biologist and his wife Gail
The ratlike little man asked fear fully Is that the machine
The thing youre going to use to to change me Thats it Fraham said Ross She rill steadily
The projector that is going to throw you million years ahead of the rest of the human race in evolutionary development His serious eyes kindled with scientific enthusiasm as he addressed the wizened little Fraham Evolution is ordinarily very slow process he went on physical and mental change which recently dis Do you think want to be halfape MILLION YEARS AHEAD Severed is caused by certain kinds of cosmic radiation that effect slight changes in our bodies forcing our race ever higher on the road of prog ress
Ive found out how to produce those forces artificially many times stronger
So when turn those vastly intensified forces on your body you will in few minutes pass through evolutionary changes that will take million years for the rest of the race to pass through naturally Yes but whatll change into cried Fraham
Suppose change into something awful what then Once Ive thrown you ahead in de velopment and observed what the human race will evolve into can bring you back to your present status Sherill told him calmly
found certain cosmic radiation that reverses evolutionary change and Ill use that on you The lanky young scientist took packet of bills from his pocket
Heres the thousand dollars agreed to give you for submitting to the experiment
Youll get it when were done raham stiffened at sight of the money and an ugly gleam came into his slitted eyes
might add that youll get the money only by undergoing the experi ment Sherill added pleasantly
have pistol in my pocket and if you try anTthing Ill shoot
Well what about it are you willing to undergo the experiment Frahams face was beaded with perspiration and his eyes rolled from the money to the bulky enigmatic mechanism
He finally spoke hoarsely
Ive got to do it and you know it you know the police are hot after me and that need that grand to get out of the country
But remember he added desperately you promised to bring me back so Ill be just like am now will youll be out of here in an hour Ross Sherill told him eagerly
Step inside the projector As Fraham slowly obeyed entering the cylindrical cage with steps weighted by dread Gail Sherill laid trembling hand on her husbands arm
Her dark eyes held fear
Ross she said Im afraid of this experiment
wish youd give it up Dont bother me now dear please the tense young scientist begged
He was turning switches shifting controls
The generators around the room broke into humming life the great tubes silently lit to violet glow transformers sprayed crack ling brush
Sherill his hand on the final switch regarded the terrified little man inside the projector
Just stand steady Fraham he said
It will take only fifteen min utes of exposure to the force He flung the svitch
Brilliant white light broke from the vertical bars of the projector blinding cascade of radiation that hid from sight the trembling man inside
The evolution accelerating force was playing upon that mans body millions of times more powerful than such forces had ever played upon human being be fore
Ross Sherill watched tensely his hand on the switch
Behind him Gail watched too her slim figure rigid with fear of the unknown
What was going on inside that glowdng halo
What tremendous changes were taking place in Fraham as the awful cosmic forces flung him through thousands of years of future develop ment each minute
It was ghastly unholy the fear ridden girl told herself this artificial shortcut on the road of slow evolu tion
Her husband was violating the basic laws of the universe itself in thus hurling human being million years past his fellows in development
Why had she ever let him do it
Sherill counted the minutes be neath his breath
Fourteen fifteen He threw the switch open
The blinding glow of radiation died and they stared petrified at the man inside the cylindrical cage
The wizened ratfaced little criminal had vanished and in his place stood man of superhuman terrible aspect
His huge form was bursting from Frahams clothes
For this man was THRILLING WONDER STORIES almost seven feet tall with colossal shoulders tapering down into lean perfect body of tremendous strength
body that was as much superior to the ordinary human form as man is to the ape
But the face
It was godlike in terrible beauty the features perfectly regular the mouth straight merci less line the eyes enormous glowing ones through which looked cold vast mind whose shock was felt tangibly
The head was quite hairless
My God cried Ross Sherill star ing in amazement at this superhuman figure
Fraham changed Ross change him back cried Gail clutching her husbands arm in terror
Im afraid Too late for that
Fraham or the godlike man who had been Fraham was stepping out of the projector
His glowing eyes fastened on Sherill and the dazed young scientist felt those eyes reading the depths of his mind like an open book
That inhuman gaze swung to Gails pale face and she flinched in horror from it
hen the transformed Frahams coldly beautiful face turned back to Sherill
He spoke in an icy level voice
To think it was you savage semi animal who developed me
Fraham said Ross Sherill hoarsely
You did change into the kind of man all men will be in mil lion years He went on with desperate hope
All right now that Ive seen what the course of future evolution will bring forth
Ill bring you back to your former state
Step back into the projector The creature before them laughed
cold terrifying and mirthless laughter
You amuse me he told Sherill
Do you think that would let you change me back now into what was into dimminded shriveled halfape like yourself
No stay as am
and with my brain can bring all your witless race under my rule easily Ross Gail cried desperately to her husband hell do it if you let him stay like this
You must change hinJ back Ross Sherill suddenly produced the pistol in his pocket and levelled it at the godlike Frahams heart
Back into the projector Fraham or Ill shoot he cried
dont in tend to let my experiment release superminded monster on the world The superman before him laughed again
You think to match wills with me
Throw that weapon out of tha window His glowing eyes were riveted on Ross Sherills as he uttered the com mand
As those supernal eyes bored into his soul the young biologist felt himself losing control of his own body
He tried to pull the trigger and couldnt
His muscles were obeying not his own mind but the hypnotic command of the creature before him
Resistless his hand went up and flung the pistol out of the open window
Fraham went on contemptuously in that eerie cold voice
You begin to see how helpless you are to resist me
Just as helpless will all men be when appear in their cities and order them to submit to ray rule His glowing eyes flashed
may have to destroy many of them before they learn my power
But it will be easy
My mind can devise weapons against which your race will be powerless to resist
will build the first of those weapons now As Sherill and his wife watched the superman moved swiftly about the laboratory picking up some ebonite rods two copper discs small piece of bismuth and other odd objects
They saw the transformed Fraham deftly quickly join these things to gether into tripodlike instrument crowned by the two discs
Ross Sherill realized in horror that it was some awful weapon of the future de signed to be used upon present day humanity
The lanky young scientist crouched leaped for Fra hams throat
Fraham whirled and the hypnotic MILLION YEARS AHEAD command of those terrible eyes froze Sherill halfway across the room
You will remain in this room you two commanded the superman while test my new weapon outside
can use you as subjects to test other weapons upon Without another look at them he strode out of the room with his curious weapon
Looking numbly out through tha window into the moon light they could see his huge figure striding up the slope of the hill be hind the old country house
They saw him stop up there on the crest where he seemed to be setting up and adjusting the tripodlike thing
Ross Sherill threw himself toward the door
Ill get the pistol threw outside he cried to his wife
That monsters got to be killed at once or hell de stroy the world He reached the door and stopped
He could go no further his muscles were obeying the hypnotic command of the superhuman Fraham and not his own will
Sherill concentrated strongly but could not get through that door
Neither could Gail when she tried
Ross we cant get out she sobbed
We Weve got to cried the young scientist wildly
If we dont
Ill be responsible for the havoc that crea ture will wreak on Earth Then he pointed through the window and cried Look hes trying that devilish weapon now Up there on the crest of the moon lit hill they could see the huge figure of the superhuman Fraham bending over his tripod instrument
They glimpsed swift terrific flash of white fire or force that drove out into the moonlight from the thing
They saw the monstrous superman straighten and peer into the silver night as though to see the effect of that tremendous bolt as it struck somewhere far away
ffWE cant stop him Gail was exclaiming her eyes wide with dazing horror
Were like children against brain like that un able to oppose our minds for minute against his Like bomb exploding in his brain an idea burst blindingly upon Ross Sherill
We cant oppose his mind now no he cried but what if throw myself forward million years in de velopment with the projector also
Then Id have mind as vast and powerful as his could fight him He leaped instantly toward the cylindrical cage
Im going to do it Gail
It will only take fifteen minutes for the force to throw me ahead and dont think hell return before then Gail clung to his arm crying
No Ross dont she pleaded
Youll become monster like him wont Sherill told her des perately
Fraham was of predatory criminal cast of mind and that is why even after he had developed so tre mendously he still had in mind only the desire to dominate and prey on the world
But want only to destroy the nienace of Fraham and when Ive done so Ill reenter the projector and you can use the reversing force to bring me back Before the terrified girl could pro test further he had entered the mechanism
Throw the switch Gail he com manded urgently
Theres little time The girls hand numbly closed the switch
Inside the cage of bars Ross Sherill was almost blinded by the terrific burst of glowing force from about him
As that awful flood of tingling force saturated every atom in him he felt hurled through abysses incredible fathomless and staggering
He felt his mind and body changing expanding unfolding with each pass ing minute
Vast new vistas of thought opened out in his mind things that had be fore seemed complex and obscure became crystal clear to him
He felt superhuman enhancement of his powers of reason
He knew he could solve problems in moment that wculd take an ordinary man months or years
And as his body changed THRILLING WONDER STORIES and grew he felt boundless physical vigor he had never felt before
His emotions were withering and dwindling and cold logic was now dominant in his mind
He was be coming he knew the kind of man all men would become in million years
And it seemed to him now that in changing from his former cramped body and mind he was stepping from an animal state into one of full hu manity
The glow of force died about him as the switch was opened and he could look out now into the laboratory
Before him staring wildly at him was girl
He felt repulsion at sight of her
This savage semiape female thing so undeveloped of mind and body had he really loved this
His new mind sickened at the thought
She was running toward him cry ing Ross Then she stopped and he saw horror and fear deepen in her eyes as she met his own gaze
Youre not Ross at all she whis pered
Youve changed like Fraham
Im afraid of you She was shrinking back from him in dread
But he paid no attention to her as he strode out of the cage
Fraham the other
The enemy whom he must destroy
His supersensitive ears could already hear Fraham coming down the hill returning to the house
But he did not fear the other now he knev with cold confidence that he was his match
The haggard wildeyed girl also heard now and cried warning
Ross hes coming
Go out and get the pistol if you can Be silent he ordered her
As her eyes met his commanding gaze she was mute and stricken
In his new mind Sherill felt only con tempt for her ignorant babbling
As though he needed primitive toy like that pistol
Fraham stepped into the door huge figure as tall and superhuman as himself
And Frahams gloving eyes saw him and realized in an instant what had happened
You youve changed too he cried
Well well see whos master He swung up the deadly tripodal weapon he carried
The woman screamed
Drop that weapon Ross ordered calmly
IS eyes were meeting Frahams glowing gaze beating against glowing gaze contest of two super minds more deadly than the clash of swords
Fraham was still raising his weapon but more slowly now
Slower and slower his hands moved as upon his brain beat the superhypnotic command to desist
Then Frahams hands stopped stiffly holding the tripod
He was putting every bit of his own brains colossal power into the hypnotic gaze with which he was battling the com manding eyes of the transformed Ross Sherill
The two supermen stood silent in the room that was utterly still except for the spasmodic sobs of the crouch ing girl
They were engaged in ter rific battle of minds such as Earth had never held before
Then almost imperceptibly the ter rible eyes of Fraham wavered the merest trifle
His mind before it had been projected million years ahead in development had been inferior to the scientists
And now that Sherills development also had been jumped forward ten thousand centuries his mind was still inferior was slowly breaking down before the scientists will
Slowly the hands of Fraham low ered
In his eyes was an awful agony of searing hate and fury
Yet he could not keep his mental defenses from crumbling before the others assault
Drop the weapon repeated Ross Sherill coldly his godlike face un changed in calm Frahams fingers relaxed and the diabolical tripodweapon rattled to the floor
Step into the projector ordered the transformed scientist his gaze never flickering
As he understood the meaning of that command Frahams eyes became terrible
Hellfires of furious revolt MILLION YEARS AHEAD flamed in them surge of terrific mental resistance
But Sherills commanding gaze held steady beating the other down again with hypnotic command
hoarse strangled sound bursting from his lips the huge figure of Fraham moved stiffly across the laboratory and into the tall cage of the projector
Sherill still holding the other with his eyes followed
His hand found the switch of the evolution reversing force and snapped it shut
Blue radia tion burgeoned from the bars wrap ping Frahams great form in shroud of azure light
Ross Sherill watched immobile as the projector hummed for minute after minute
The crouching girl was staring stunned at the cold awesome beauty of his inhuman face
Then Sherill flung open the switch
The blue force ceased
And there in the projector stood Fraham not the transformed mighty superman but the wizened ratfaced little criminal
He staggered out dazedly wildly
he faltered and sank into dead faint on the floor
Sherill felt touch on his sleeve
It was the girl that savage atavistic female thing looking up into his face
Ross you conquered him you brought him back and kept him from destroying the world she cried
Now enter the projector yourself
Let me bring you back to the man you were my husband Bring him back
Drag him back across million years of development to become semiape like herself to become again cramped of mind and body an unclean primitive animal
No every thought in Sherills brain revolted at the idea
He wouldnt give up this tremendous power of brain and body this supermanhood hed attained
He couldnt
The girl seemed to read his thoughts
You promised Ross she pleaded
He shook her off coldly
What had he to do with this savage creature
Outside lay world that only his great brain could put in order world waiting for him to be its master
here was much for him to do in that world race to be forced into new cleaner ways of living war and greed and trickery to be stamped out
He could do all that Ross Somehow that cry of heartbreak made him stop at the door
Something in his inmost fibers something still strangely bound to this savage crea ture was stopped and held by it
Ross its Gail Gail she was cry ing to him
You must enter the pro jector for me His relentlessly clear mind told him that this woman was seeking to drag him back into state of savagery like her own to take away forever his wonderful mind and body
Yet something deep within him something not to be controlled even by all his tremendous mental power made him move slow step by step to ward the cylindrical cage
At its very edge he hesitated feeling stronger than ever that sick repulsion at the thought of returning to halfanimal state
Please Ross He stepped very slowly inside the cage of bars
With choking sob the girl threw shut the switch
When the blue reversing force stopped it was Ross Sherill not the transformed godlike figure of before but again the lanky young scientist who stepped out of the projector
He looked bewilderedly from the unconscious figure of Fraham on the floor to the girl who was running madly toward him
Ross youve come back she cried
Sherills face was aghast
Why remember now didnt want to come back to you Gail he said
You looked like an animal to me looked repulsive apelike He held her tight
God what an awful thing that pro jector almost released on the world he whispered
Im going to destroy it and never build another
Whatever power has decreed the slow rate of human evolution knows better than we men knows that if we tried to go too fast upon that evolutionary road we would only destroy ourselves ELIXIR of DOOM An Exciting Sensational Drama of the Little Worlds That No Man Can See

CHAPTER The Flower Box the fourth sector of the North Atlantic Airway the westbound night plane with mail and fifty passengers was in trouble
fuel leak had been discovered
Well drop down on Pontoon Four the chief pilot said
Wont delay us much Queer the radio man said cant get word out of Somers and Alden Pontoon lay glistening in the moonlight
little emergency land ing field fifty by hundred and fifty feet
metal raft raised on its pon toons alone here in the Atlantic
The moonlight gleamed on its flat metal expanse
At one end was small metal shed the supply house
At the other close against the lowrailed side of the raft stood the little cottage where the pontoonkeepers lived
There were two of them two young Amer icans Roy Somers and George Alden
The cottage was singlestory structure entirely of metal silver glistening alumite
This night of June th was calm
The sea was placid
The officers and passen gers of the distressed airliner gazed down at the somnolent empty pon toon
Its beacon lights were burning
The windows of the little cottage glowed with yellow illumination from within
But where were Roy Somers and George Alden
They should have an swered the radio call
Very queer the radio man said
There ought to be more than Somers and Alden here
Only an hour ago had message from the eastbound Inside Tiny Flower Box Somers and plane
It stopped here
Put off two passengers relatives of Alden An hour ago nothing had been wrong here
The Londonbound flyer had brought old Professor Alden and his daughter Anne from New York
They were George Aldens father and sister who were to spend few days on the pontoon visiting him
And the chief pilot of that other plane had re ported something else
Was it reptile from the prehistoric ages serpent hundreds of feet long
Shortly after leaving the pontoon passenger was found to be miss ing One Jose Toro who had come aboard at New York
He was booked through to London but evidently he had left the ship at the pontoon
Very strange
Five people unac counted for
The pilots searched the pontoon
They got their fuel from the storehouse
There was no sign of disorder
Nothing wrong
They searched the little metal cottage
Its door had smashed lock
Nothing else was wrong
The few small in terior rooms showed no signs of vio lence
The luggage of Professor Al den and his daughter stood as mute evidence that the guests had arrived
The officers of the mail plane re ported the condition of Pontoon by radio to New York and to London and in ten minutes they departed
Perilous Manhunt
THRILLING WONDER STORIES When they were gone Pontoon still lay silent and deserted
Drama had been here tragedy doubtless but it was over now
But was it
On the floor of the kitchen under the low southern win dow stood little flower box
It was box only foot wide two feet long and hardly six inches deep
Soil was in it
geranium flowered at its cen ter
It seemed to have been neglected
Was only recently watered
Nothing of tragedy and drama go ing on here now
No sign of life here on this deserted metal raft
Here in the flower box little sign of life showed an ant in one corner wan dered disconsolately over the dirt looking for food
But what of that
Anyone here now staring at the little flower box would have concluded that there was nothing to see
Fatuous reasoning
Who ever thinks of the amazing realms of small ness always under our eyes teeming always with drama and tragedy
This little flower box for in stance
hour and half before the dis tressed westbound flyer landed at Pontoon and found it deserted Roy Somers sat with George Alden in the kitchen of their metal house
Al den had just come from his radio in strument in the adjoining room
The eastbound plane is landing here Alden said
Roy what do you think father and Anne coming to spend day or two His face was flushed his dark eyes sparkled
The big blondhaired Somers was excited
Good Lord what news
Your father and Anne Somers could think only of Anne
Coming here now
Anne who through all the lonely days and nights was so constantly in his thoughts
In ten or fifteen minutes Alden said
What surprise
Get busy Roy got to get this place slicked up The plane from New York landed swiftly discharged Professor Alden and Anne and quickly departed
To Somers it was like dream having Anne here
He clung to her hands
smal slim darkhaired girl her face like his was flushed
Roy youre hurting my hands He released her hands in confu sion and turned to her father
Pro fessor Alden was small frail grey haired man in his sixties thin and wiry like his son George
Somers picked up the suitcases but there was one small satchel which the professor insisted on carrying himself
Ill tell you about it later he said
discovery of mine Anne began cooking supper
The professor and his son crossed the raft to inspect the supply house
Somers joined them
But after minute or two he wanted to be back with Anne
He left them unceremoniously re crossed the metal field in the moon light and approached the little metal cottage
The door was closed
He had left it open just few moments before
Then he was stricken by the sound of voice
Not Annes voice
And am here
want to be with you The voice of Jose Toro
Somers recognized its suave Spanish accent
He had met this Toro
young Latin American chemist who in New York was Professor Aldens assist ait
Somers had never liked him
For one thing he was far too attentive to Anne
But Jose thought you were on the plane going on to London But got off
There is some thing sudden jealousy had made Som ers pause by the door
There was small hallway inside beyond which was the kitchen
Anne and Toro evi dently were there
The voices were muffled by the closed metal door but still they were plainly audible
Jose The girl obviously was startled
Jose let me go Anne was almost screaming with terror
The house had several win dows all of which were open
Somers leaped for one of them
The heavy metal hurricane blind came snapping down in his face
And all the others slid closed simultaneously all of ELIXIR OF DOOM them electrically operated from switch inside the house
And there was Toros muffled voice Stop fighting you little fool
do not want to hurt you Back at the door Somers frantically pounded lunging against it but it resisted all his efforts
And the metal window blinds vere the same
The little house was impregnable
Mingled with Annes screams of protest again came Toros voice Adventure for you and me eh ninta
No one can catch us now To the raging Somers the voice seemed to have new quality
Behind Somers young Alden and the professor came dashing up breath less
That fellow Toro Somers gasped
Here inside here with Anne The voices inside were steadily grow ing fainter
Get crowbar George
Well break the door It seemed an eternity while they waited and Somers raged and plunged at the resisting door
Then within minute young Alden came rushing back with the heavy iron bar
The voices inside were very much dimmer now queerly far away in sound
But they could not escape from the sealed metal house
Somers thought that triumphantly as he seized the crowbar and bashed in the door lock with single blow
They rushed inside
It seemed to Somers that just then he heard Annes faint terrified cries
But the place was empty
Somers dashed through the rooms
Anne he called where are you He dashed from one little room to the other
Searching frantically The sealed house was empty
the kitchen the trembling Pro fessor Alden straightened from the floor
His small satchel was in his hand
He set it on the table
It was open
Somers saw rows of tiny metal vials some red some white
He has stolen some of my drugs my great discovery the professor said Somers and Alden stood gasping
Amazing diabolical plot of this Jose Toro
Amazing thing of sci ence this which now the professor was so vehemently telling
As the professors assistant Toro had helped for the past two years in the old mans chemical researches
Revolutionary research successfully ending with an amazing discovery
drug to shrink every tiny atom of the human body cells
To reduce in size every atom of any living organism
Uniform dwindling so that the shape the identity of the complex cell ag glomerations remained unchanged and only the bulk was altered
The professor gasped out his as tounding secret as with trembling fin gers he searched his satchel of vials
drug for reducing the mass of living organism
And drug which was its opposite to increase the mass increase the bulk
Incredible thing
Somers stood con fused
Yet it explained this disappearance of Anne and Toro
Incredible fantasy
Yet here it was
Somers mind tried to encompass it
Anne and the villainous Toro had been here but now they were gone
But theyre not gone Professor Alden was saying
Theyre right here of course
Gone from us in size but right here somewhere
Well have to take the drug
Make our selves small find them somewhere here The professors hands shook as he gripped his little vials Roy George thats what Anne and came to tell you
thought we might make an experiment here
Ive never yet tried this with human
Only with insects He held one of the red and one of the white vials
The red for dwin dling
We must hurry
Theyll be gone so far into smallness He suddenly checked himself
Somers saw an expression of horror sweep his face
On the floor there was sound of scratching
The rasp and scuttling of insect feet unnat urally loud
For an instant the three men stood chilled with horror
They saw the thing now an oblong black thing down on the floor of the room over THRILLING WONDER STORIES by the window
The bright light from the overhead electric bulb illumined it clearly
An ant six inches ong
It stood belligerent on its bent legs
The professors voice broke the tense silence
He Toro must have dropped pellet of the enlarging drug
This ant licking at it dont you realize It seemed to Somers that his heart stopped beating
The ant was visibly enlarging swifter always as though every moment its rate of growth was accelerating
Its multiple eyes glared
It reared erect
Kill it The old professor was terrified into panic of confusion
The thing eluded them
Long glis tening black shape pinched in the middle like an hourglass
It disap peared through the broken outer door out to the moonlit expanse of the pontoon
Roy my God Roy George Somers and young Alden leaped past the whitefaced old man
At the outer doorway all three paused
The professor gasped
Weve got to kill it
Cant let it swim away escape It will devas tate the vorld Out in the moonlight near the cen ter of the glistening metal landing field the hideous thing stood poised
Only an ant
Somers stood with cold horror clutching at his heart
The damnable thing was growing larger
What would its size in an hour be
Swimming the ocean reaching shore
monster with no limit to its growth perhaps
Again the ant reared itself erect
Its eyes glowed phosphorescent in the moonlight
And then it dropped horizontally
Belligerent with the realization of its size it came scut tling forward
CHAPTER II The Fight with the Ant Somers the brief terrifying combat was fantasy of horror
He was aware of the hideous thing advancing
Enormous insect now
It advanced lusting to seize these up right enemies who stood regarding it
Somers heard the professor give terrified cry and dart sideward
But young Alden jumped forward
The ant reared to meet him
They grappled and Alden toppled back ward fell with the ant down upon him
Somers reached for the heavy iron crowbar wdth which he had bashed in the cottage door
He seized it leaped forward just as young Alden fell
And Somers swung the iron bar
It struck the huge blackshelled body
There vas sickening mashing crack noisome stench of sticky white ooze
The back of the giant ant was broken its pinched middle sagged its whole mangled length writhed
With his senses reeling Somers stooped and jerked the fallen young Alden away
The insect lay writhing as tnough in death agony
Young Alden had rolled away and was climbing to his feet
Somers had dropped the iron bar
He turned and picked it up to strike again
Too late
Amazing strength of this ant strongest living thing of its size in all the vorld
It reared its mashed and mangled body
It seemed gigantically to leap with its broken legs
Somers head reeled he was barely aware of what was happening
He saw Professor Alden standing nearby the huge mangled insect leaping upon the old man seizing him bearing him away
Somers and young Alden all at once found themselves futilely despairing ly in pursuit
The giant ant held the old mans bodys aloft and with it scuttled and lurched across the moon lit metal surface
The professor screamed brief scream of agony
Somers flung the bar
It struck the ant mashed it again
Doubtless now the thing was dying or dead
But the momentum of its huge body and the blow of the bar slid it forward
The low guard rail of the pontoon was near at hand
The noisome gigantic mass of shell ELIXIR OF DOOM lOS Five hundred feet above Somers heaved the boulder down full at Toros head and puip still gripping its victim slid and crashed through the guard rail vanished over the edge
There was drop of thirty feet to the placid moonlit sea
silent interval of hor ror then one final splash
Tough George Somers mur mured
Hes done for
Weve for gotten Anne Got to do something They turned and ran
To Somers came the irrational thought that now in the kitchen they would seize this damnable Jose Toro
But sight of the empty room brought Somers to his senses
How could he seize Toro and rescue Anne
Yet they were here somewhere
Frantically he and Alden poked about the little room
But there was nothing to see and only silence responded to their fran tic calls
Silence and the tramp of their own footsteps the grind as they shifted chairs and tables and the faint lap of the calm ocean against the walls of the pontoon
sudden thought struck Somers which turned him cold with horror
He gripped his companion
My God George we cant do this
Well trample them if theyre here small under our feet They stood transfixed almost afraid THRILLING WONDER STORIES to move
Somers tried to reason what must have happened
This Jose Toro with his unwelcome attentions to Anne
Toro had known Professor Aldens secret of the drugs
Toro had left the plane hid den himself on the pontoon
Watch ing his chance he had got into the house stolen the drugs and the girl taken her into the realm of small ness
But where were they now
What part of the room
Alden was trem blingly opening the satchel of drugs
Two vials missing it looks like that he said
These others red and vhite father said the red ones for smallness didnt he Somers remembered it
Each seized two of the vials
Alden locked the satchel again
Somers opened his small red bottle
score of tiny red pellets were inside
But how many were they to take
hey could only guess
One per haps for normal shrinkage
They decided to take only one each at first
And add others later
But as they became small in which part of the kitchen would they search
Somers mind tried to en visage the coming experience and it set him gasping
Why to human tiny in size this kitchen would be ex panded into gigantic realm
One might run across the floor and be minutes reaching the opposite wall
Vhy if one were small enough it might be days journey
vast realm of smallness here with Toro and Anne wandering in it
Then Somers thought of something else
Toro must have dropped pel let of the enlarging drug
That ant had eaten some of it
The ant what was an ant doing in this metal kitchen on the metal pontoon in the middle of the Atlantic
The little flower box
Somers cried know where they may have gone Alden knelt with him on the floor beside the flower box The overhead light shone strong upon it
Look Roy
Look Alden murmured
Amazing sight
Down there on the caked dirt half hidden by the tiny fuzz of growth two little figures were plainly visible
Toro and Anne
He was carrying her inert body in his arms
Tiny human figures
quarter of an inch high no more
Toro carry ing Anne
Struggling laboriously through the growth of grass blades
Dwindling figures
Already they were smaller than moment before
The grass far taller than Toros head almost hid them
vague instinct made Somers reach down
But he checked himself Powerless
How could he seize that tiny human form no bigger than an ant
His descend ing hand suddenly seemed monstrous his thumb and forefinger were in capable of grasping the minute figures
Breathlessly he and Alden crouched stared down
Toros threading ad vance had moved the grass blades but now he was too small for that
He staggered with Annes body moving between the blades without touching them
Was Anne dead
Somers could not think so for the fleeing Toro then would have abandoned her
She had fainted probably
Then he knew that Anne was not dead
The drugs were effective on living organisms only and Annes body now was dwindling equally with her captors
Toro came out of the grass
So small
eighth of an inch high
Certainly no more than that
And it seemed that as Somers bent lower to look Toro was gazing up with waving arm in gesture of de fiance
Almost invisible now
Somers blinked
He heard Alden mutter Gone No
Still there Somers was al most sure he saw the tiny moving speck which was Toro and the pin point dot of Annes bluewhite dress
There was tiny ridged crack in the caked dirt smaller than one would make with the scratch of fingernail
It seemed that the moving specks had dropped into it vanished
Somers breathed again
And then he tensed
George he murmured give me match
dont dare look ELIXIR OF DOOM away
dont dare Somers continued to stare at the spot
His groping hand took the match from Alden
Then he bent lower and very carefully stuck the match up right into the dirt half or three quarters of an inch from where Anne had disappeared
Carefully he mem orized the direction
Two pellets
Would that dwindle them quickly enough
He stood with Alden both of them pale and tense
They held the pellets ready
Somers nodded to Alden and simultaneously they swallowed the drug
Somers instinctively closed his eyes
He was conscious of an instant sweetish queerly aromatic taste in his mouth
His senses reeled with dizzying swoop
CHAPTER III Descent into Smallness omers opened his eyes
The sense of swooping dizziness per sisted for moment and then clari fied into semblance of normality
He found Alden clinging to him
You all right Roy Yes
Only feel queer tingling sensation They were seated together on the kitchen floor with upraised knees and feet drawn close to their bodies
The little flower box was in front of them
To one side were the legs of the kitchen table with its level top above their heads
Suddenly they were con scious that the whole scene was in motion
The walls the ceiling everything in the kitchen seemed to be slowly shifting
queer steady crawling change
Slow at first like the hands of clock whose movement is barely perceptible
But the change was ob vious
EverTthing was expanding
And the movement was not only visual
They could feel it now
The floor was crawling outward under them
It drew their feet out so that their knees shifted down with tiny jerks
They had to hitch themselves into new positions to maintain bal ance
Amazing but after moment they found the physical strangeness pass ing
They stood up clinging together with the floor shifting under their feet pulling their feet apart so that every moment they had to take step inward
And the movement was ac celerating
weird change was taking place
The table legs were huge
The table top was higher than their heads
The flower box seemed to have doubled its size and it was no longer near them
Six feet away now and shifting crawling steadily further into the ex panding distance
Somers laughed grimly
Got to keep our wits not get rattled Yes
think wed better go over there They started walking
The sensa tion was strange but in moment they got used to it
Six feet to the flower box
They took few steps
But the box was drawing away
They ran
The wall of the box was at their shoulders when they reached it
shoulderhigh green fence
They scrambled up over it tumbled in heap onto the dirt
Somers saw some six feet away round white pole sticking up waisthigh
The match
Another few feet beyond it would be the place where Anne had gone
Mustnt go there yet Somers warned
Were too big
Might trample her For moment they stood with the waisthigh grass blades expanding around them
From the edge of the box there was drop of thirty or forty feet
The kitchen tabletop was monstrous plateau quarter of mile away and high in the sky
No the wide expanse of ceiling was still visible as blur above them an expanding fading blur
The electric light bulb up there was dis tant spot of white glare
How long they stood engrossed Somers did not realize
Then he swung about his heart pounded with alarm
The white matchstick was THRILLING WONDER STORIES great pole eighteen or twenty feet high
And it was thirty or forty feet away
Beyond it very distant over the huge grass fronds great tower ing shape was visible
Somers moved to where between the twentyfoot leaves of the grass he would see that towering shape clearly
crooked pillar of brown green towering up hundreds of feet to blurred mass of red
The geranium
lake of muddy water was at its bottom
Alden too was staring in amaze ment
And suddenly he was gripping Somers
Things moving
My God you see them The world of the flower box
Steadily with constant accelera tion it was opening up
And there were things alive here of course
With trembling hand Alden was pointing at the expanding tower of the gerani umstem
Things alive on it
They were too far away now to be distin guished clearly
But undoubtedly there were moving living beings
new world here
And in it time was lost size was lost
Size and distance always changing
Everything growing swiftly gigantic and mov ing away into newly created realms of distance
Then suddenly Somers became aware of the matchstick again
It was gleaming white column now
It towered two hundred feet into the bluewhite blur of sky
And it was at least four hundred feet away over the tumbled expanse of dirt and rock
Somers went cold
The column was receding so fast
Could they reach it
Somers ran with his companion floundering after him
Four hundred feet
He knew he had run that far but still the gigantic white column loomed ahead
Then panting almost winded they reached it ran around its huge curving side
This way Somers panted
To ward the geranium The geranium plant was only blur in the distance with gleaming radi ance shining upon the watery ex panse at its base
Somers headed to ward it
Another desperate run
Amazing realms of smallness miles of rocky cragstrewn waste ridged and pitted little gullies opening
They leaped over them
They stumbled fell picked themselves up and ran on
Roy wait cant Im all out of breath Somers stopped
Despair was in his heart
They had waited too long
They could never reach that crack
Alden came panting up
Take it easy
Weve got to keep together Weve got to reach that crack Alden smiled grimly
If were too small we can get larger you know
No need of all this running he added
Both realized that the tumbled area of rocky distance had lost its move ment
The drugs action had worn off
They peered into the half light
Rocks were strewn here now
Gi gantic green stalks rose into the sky behind them the grass blades
Mem ory came to Somers
This was the place where Toro had stood carrying Anne
Roy look off there Somers followed the gesture
mile or two away the rocky ground suddenly burst upward
An earth quake monstrous cataclysm
It shook them with the rocks shudder ing under their feet
distant up heaval
The ground rising as though by vast explosion
Yet it was slow upheaval
pushing upward
mountain of earth rising hundred or two hundred feet into the air and falling back into huge tumbled lit ter of broken rock
The roar of it came echoing from the distance queer crashing roar blurred and muffled
They stood gazing transfixed
The earth had been pushed upward by monster coming up from under ground
mile or two away but still they could see the gigantic shape
Was it reptile from the prehistoric ages monstrous serpent hundreds of feet long
They could see it slithering twist ing coiling itself then lengthening ELIXIR OF DOOM out moving away until in moment it had vanished
Whitefaced Somers turned to his companion
He tried to laugh
The tension of his taut nerves made him feel suddenly hysterical
George do you know what that vas My God no worm wriggling up through the loose dirt
worm in the flover box Astonishing aspects of size
Size to govern ones viewpoint of everything
That monster only miserable little worm
Why here in the vial of drugs in his pocket was his ability to get large again to change that distant fearsome monster back into harm less wriggling little worm
Somers felt into his pockets to make sure that the vials were safe
He re called the professors brief words con cerning his drugs an aura which they flung about the living organism they were altering an aura like magnet ic field so that his clothing and the small articles in his pockets were within its influence
Yes the vials were sate
He laughed grimly
Weve sure got to keep our wits George
This can be handled better than were do ing it They were planning to take some of the enlarging drug
And then they saw what was obviously the crack into vhich Anne and Toro had vanished
It showed now as yawning shadow across the landscape about quarter of mile away
Come on Somers said
Easier to walk there than to take any more of the drug They started
Somers was ponder ing what procedure Toro might have followed
One dose of the drug would have worn off now
Had Toro taken more
hey came to the crack
Stood awed
It was long broken gully
great ridge of upflung earth was here on the plateau of its upper brink
They stood on the tumbled summit gazing down
If they went down there Somers said dubiously suppose we ought to climb down The descent did not take them long
They stood presently on the guliy floor with the broken walls towering above them
The twilight was deep er here
The sky was ribbon of greyblue haze
Silent rocky desolation
Their low voices echoed with queer muffled quality
But where have they gone Al den was saying
Roy how can we ever find them There were plenty of rocky re cesses here where Toro might be hid ing
Somers took step then checked himself shuddering
Anne might be here at his feet tiny as an ant
His gaze swept the stonelittered gully floor
George whats that over there he said abruptly
little crumpled white thing ten or fifteen feet away
They went and picked it up
It was small square of white linen smelling faintly of perfume
In its corner was small embroidered Annes handkerchief
Had she dropped it here by accident or was it trail which she purposely had left for them to follow
They were here Somers said thats evident
believe Anne dropped it purposely
She may have marked this spot here for us to show that this is where they took the sec ond dose of the drug They consulted
Then each took second red pellet
The sensations were not so confusing this time
THRILLING WONDER STORIES Crawling shifting of the enlarging landscape
The handkerchief grew monstrous
great billowing mass of white fabric
Presently it was higher than their heads
The strands were like plaited rope
The billowing folds were ten feet high
Then twenty feet
Look here Alden was stooping
On the shift ing ground which every moment was growing rougher more broken there lay bent black wire
It was several feet long and rapidly enlarging
One of Annes hairpins
No mis taking it
The trail into smallness
Brave little Anne She had recovered from unconsciousness
She was alert now leaving trail for them to follow
And the deduction of another fact was easy
This monstrous hairpin in another moment it was longer than Somers body still was far smaller than normal compared to the gigantic crumpled mass of the handkerchief
Anne and Toro had dwindled here
They had taken the second dose of the drug
And they were not moving very far in space only in size
We must keep ourselves here Somers said until this dose is worn off
doubt if theyd take third one Again he envisioned the enormity of smallness
This was only two pel lets
With others one might go down and down into infinity
Every tiny widening crack here at his feet held new gigantic realms if one were small enough to penetrate them
Every tiny grain of rock in this vast valley held new universe of small ness
At last the drug again wore off
Somers and Alden stood regarding great tumbled white hill
thing indescribable
Billowing folds of shaggy white ropestrands woven into titanic fabric
It stood piled into huge mass fifty feet or so in height with spread of an acre or more
score of entrances to the dark recesses under it were near at hand
Cave mouth openings and in one place yawning oval ten feet high
Somers and Alden stood peering into the inner darkness
Was the trail lost
There had been no other sign from Anne
Were she and Toro mo tionless now
Hiding somewhere here
wonder Somers said
just wonder That cavern in there From the yawning opening ahead there came muffled scream
cry of protest
Annes voice
With Alden after him Somers dashed forward plunging into the blackness of the cavern
CHAPTER IV Combat of Size had seemed dark under the vast billowy folds of the handkerchief
But when he got inside Somers was at once aware of light
reflected sheen from the fabric itself and dim effulgence from the rocks
He had noticed it outside in the gully while ago glowing dim phosphor escence
Swiftly he and Alden dashed for ward their eyes rapidly becoming ac customed to the softer light
The scream was not repeated
Quiet Somers murmured
Got to locate them He had stopped and stood clutching Alden
They listened peering
glowing labyrinth here
Round ed shelflike recesses in dozen places of the cavern walls
And all of it plaited rope strands so coarse fab ric that they could have climbed its rounded slopes
No sound
Eerie phosphorescent darkness
Give me that Toros voice
The sound of scuffle
And then they saw Toro and Anne
Two figures seemingly of normal height
They were standing about fifty feet away on shelflike recess of the fabric wall some fifteen feet above the rocks
Toro in white shirt and dark trousers Anne in her pale blue dress
Both mudstained with clothes torn by the journey
They stood on the ledge struggling ELIXIR OF DOOM the man gripping her cuffing her
Give me that wont
Kill me if you like wont go any further They had not yet seen their pur suers
Anne quite evidently had seized vial of the drugs
He was trying to snatch it from her
The realization came to Somers as he and Alden dashed forward
He was aware that up there on the ledge Anne had jerked loose her arm and flung something away
The vial of diminishing drug
It hurtled through the air and fell to the rocky floor
Toro shouted an oath
And then he saw his oncoming enemies
Somers already had reached the slope which led to the ledge
He leaped upon the rough fabric climbing it
Toro seemed stricken with astonishment
He stood defiant thin dark face livid with rage
His hand darted into his trousers pocket
The vial of the enlarging drug
Fiendish triumph distorted his face as he swallowed pellet
And ab ruptly Somers saw that he was grov ing
slim Latin American
But al ready he was six feet tall
Alden was shouting After him
Kill him
Ill come with you
Dont let him escape with that drug In that second reason came to the stricken Somers
He fumbled in his pocket
The vial of enlarging drug
Take it quickly
Match this fellow in his growth
And he swung and shouted at Al den You stay here
Take care of Anne
No both of you get large not so dangerous but keep away from me
Ill fight him Somers crammed two pellets into bis mouth
sevenfoot Toro leer ing with the triumph of his growing bulk stood up there now
Then he turned jumped backward down an other slope and vanished
Somers head had reeled from the drug but almost at once the feeling passed
He was aware that the eerie phosphorescent scene was shrinking
The fabric of ceiling was coming down the walls closing in
These closing walls
It startled Somers into panic of confusion
He stood tense clinging to the slope of the fabric
But its surface was smoothing the spaces between the ropestrands were closing on his fin gers
He could feel the surface bend ing under his weight
And suddenly he slipped saved himself from falling by backward leap
He had thought it was drop of nearly ten feet but it seemed only two or three
He got his balance stood wavering
On the dwindling rockground across the cavern lay Anne with her brother holding her
Dwindling figures already they were no longer than Somers arm
HERE was blur of movement as Toro made rush through nar rowing sidepassage
Somers scram bled after him
The shrinking fabric wails scraped him as he wedged through
Panting he got outside turned and beheld the small tunnel way through which he had emerged
It was hardly big enough for his hand
Got you now He swung around as the figure of Toro leaped upon him
They grap pled
Somers mind was alert
Above everything he knew he must keep his wits
The shock of Toros weight made him stagger backvard
Purpose ly he went limp sagged and fell pull ing his adversary down upon him
And then with sudden lunge twist ed and brought himself uppermost
He found Toro perhaps foot larger than himself
Stronger un doubtedly
But both quite evidently had taken two of the pellets
It seemed that there was no relative change in Toros size
He and Somers were enlarging with equal rapidity
Somers found himself straddling Toros chest
The fellow was lunging squirming flailing with his fists
Around him Somers was aware of the dizzying swooping scene
All shrinking
Rocky walls of the val ley lowering and closing
And almost at his side was crumpled white handkerchief
He was gripping Toros throat and Toro with his breath shut off was choking his eyes bulging
But tire sight of the shrinking handkerchief set Somers shuddering
THRltLING WONDER STORIES It seemed with that instant glance that he saw the tiny figure of Alden carrying Anne trying to run
Realization swept Somers
At any instant his leg or the flailing legs of the prostrate Toro might mangle those tiny running figures
He cast Toro off
He leaped erect
Stooping he snatched Toro sideward
Barely in time
It seemed that the handker chief was almost under Somers feet
The double dosage of the drug had confused Somers so that he scarcely thought of combat with his human enemy
But Toro had lunged to his feet
He stood panting and then he jumped again upon Somers
They wrestled fought with wild scrambling blows
Somers felt the thud of Toros fist upon his head
Toros face was close as he panted can conquer the world with these drugs
dropped some of it but have plenty left You have to do for me first Som ers retorted
But his adversary was strong
He was bending Somers backward now his weight pressing his dark satur nine face leering with triumph
Somers felt himself backing against rocky wall
Incredible for beyond Toros shoulder there was another wall advancing
And Toro saw the danger
He mum bled with startled horror
His grip loosened he jerked away
Somers momentarily free recovered his bal ance
These closing walls
This was no valley in whicn they were fighting
No more than narrow rocky trench few feet wide and shoulderhigh
Horrified realization swept Somers
In another moment his gigantic bulk would be mangled here between these rocky sides
He saw Toro make leap and scramble upward
The ditch walls vere pressing but the upper surface had come down to Somers waist
He jumped drew himself up and rolled out
It seemed that the slit of rock was closing like reptiles mouth trying to seize his emerging legs
The upper surface familiar undu lating dirt and rocky terrain lay spread in the distance
As Somers staggered erect dizzy with the dwin dling scene again the murderous Toro came at him
OWN under the giant folds of the handkerchief Anne and her brother saw the enlarging form of Toro rush away and the gigantic Somers after him
Alden was aware of the danger
He lifted Anne
Can you walk guess so
Im better now Got to get outside get away
Theyll be too large might trample us An amazing scene encountered them as they ran outside
combat of giants
They saw the fallen Toro Somers astride his chest choking him
Men twenty feet tall
Now thirty feet
In another moment Alden realized these giants would trample the hand kerchief
The sweep of one of their legs would presently encompass hundred feet of this rocky ground
Anne was limping with twisted ankle
Alden picked her up carried her running to escape
can take the drug now Anne murmured
Foolish of me to be afraid of it
Put me dovn
Wed bet ter take it George He thought so too
The gigantic trouser legs of Somers and Toro great svaying pillars rising into the air lunged back and forth
Dizzying mammoth blurs in the gloom
The enormous bodies were blotting out the sky
Suddenly the Titan shapes lifted upward and were gone
Alden and Anne each took pellet of the drug
The valley closed in on them
They scrambled out to the surface
The giants were still fighting
There was more light out here and they were plainly visible
It seemed that now they were fully mile away
They swayed locked together
Five hundred feet tall
It seemed so
Then they went down rolling lung ing
Then up again staggering with mammoth strides
And then Anne cried Oh look
ELIXIR OF DOOM Dear God look at Roy Somers had
been beaten to his knees
Toros fists were raining blows upon him
Then suddenly as though with supreme effort Somers was erect
One of his arms dangled be hind him
The watchers saw that the dangling hand held boulder
And Somers heaved it aloft and crashed it down full on Toros head
There was breathless moment while Toro stood wavering
The boulder dropped with great roar to the ground and Somers staggered back panting
breathless instant
Then the body of Toro fell forward came toppling crashing down
For moment its thousandfoot length writhed and twisted
Then it lay still with the mammoth figure of Somers bending over it
CHAPTER Tiny Arena omers bent down panting over the fallen body of his antag onist
Toro was dead
No doubt of that the smashed weltering head was mute gruesome evidence
And there vas other evidence in that moment Somers was aware that the motionless dead thing was dwindling
Death had checked the effect of the drug
He stood now swaying over Toro
The body had seemed perhaps seven feet long
He saw it shrinking now
The whole rocky terrain was shrink ing
Vague distant blurs of monstrous shapes were dwindling coming closer taking familiar form
Why these tremendous green stalks they were blades of grass
That giant yellow white pole that was the matchstick
Somers hastily retreated
He must keep away from that matchstick
Al den and Anne might so easily be trampled
Minutes more of the shrinking landscape
And every moment it was more familiar
That great red blur in the sky that was the geranium blossom
Somers turned the other way
The great green stalks were thickening around him
Hardly higher than his head now and he pushed his way through them
Presently he was wad ing in them with their tops lower than his waist
He came to kneehigh parapet with an abyss beyond it and great blurred vista of open distance
But the blurs off there were taking form
The monstrous blurred spread of sur face off there so high and far away came down and shrank and showed itself to be the kitchen table
Somers stood peering over the brink of the flower boK
The vastness of the kitchen floor seemed hun dred feet below him
But soon it was fifty twenty
He swung over the edge
For mo ment he clung dangling by his hands
drop of ten feet
He let go
Land ed on his feet
The wall of the flow er box dwindled to his shoulders
The action of the drug was wear ing off
Somers sat on the open kitch en floor until the movement of the scene had ceased The little flower box was here
Two feet long foot wide six inches deep
He bent anxiously over the small spread of dirt peer ing waiting for Anne and her brother
They came at last
Tiny figures enlarging
Shoving through the grass climbing as he had climbed over the side and out of the box
Carefully he lifted the tiny sixinch figure of Anne and set her on the floor but the dizzying swoop of his carrying hand left her gasping
At last they were together again and all things assumed their normal proportions
Moonlight streamed in through the open window of the darkened kitch en
The placid summer ocean rippled with silver
Somers sat with Anne beside him
Alden was in the adjoin ing room at the radio sender
think Somers said out of si lence that the drugs should be de stroyed
Too dangerous
And the flower box the drugs are in it
De stroy this flower box The girl shuddered

ORGANIC COMPOUNDS Editor Science Questions and Answers was surprised the other day to find that the chemical formulae of cane sugar and milk sugar are the same This seems little odd since they are different in sweetening power
From what little chemistry Ive had always understood that different substances must have differ ent formulae
Gloucester Virginia
The study of sugars and related com pounds belongs in the realm of organic chemistry the compounds of carbon
The Incredibly numerous compounds containing carbon are all due to the latters remarkable ability to hook up with almost anything in chains rings and other formations
All sugars are basically of the foimula given above but each is put together in different way with resulting differences in taste appearance and chemical activity
If the atoms in general sugar molecule were arranged merely by chance there could be different combinations
Only few dozen are known however
In organic chemistry the formula above means nothing
It simply indicate the pro portions by weight of carbon hydrogen and oxygen
For true indication of compo sition the organic chemist uses structural formulae which show exactly how the molecule is put together
He can show by the change in position of atom why this sugar and that are quite different
As typical example common alcohol has the same formula as methyl ether which is poisonous
When we look at the chemists structural formulae ve see how they are different
Alcohol is Methyl ether is This difference in hooking up makes all the difference be tween liquid which can be drunk and one which cannot besides many other differ nces

It pulsates much like wave
The pulsations are periods of activity and rest
Activity drives all the bodys chemical processes in one direction toward fatigue
This state is characterized by the presence of excess phosphates in the blood
To complete the cycle the organic organism must have rest
This allows the chemical processes to reverse and prepare for an other stretch of activity
Fortunately however nature has pro vided that our heart and lungs have different system of rest periods than our brain muscles and bodj cells in general
This was necessary because the animal or ganism cannot survive any extended period of rest for the heart lungs and stomach
These organs work and rest pulsate very rapidly
After each heartbeat the heart rests for fraction of second
After each breath the lungs take short nap The total amount of rest in days time for the heart is about the same as that we give our bodies when we lie down and sleep
CANALS OF MARS Editor Science Questions and Answers What is all the discussion on the canals of Mars about
Isnt it definitely known whether they are there or not
One would think such an easily observed phenomenon would have been settled long ago
Madison Wisconsin
Strange to say the authenticity of the Martian canals has not been proved
In Shiaparelli vho was admittedly sharpeyed announced that he saw fine line markings on Mars which he called canali Unfortunately that Italian word is far too suggestive when transposed to English
Shiaparelli meant channels not manmade canals
Since bis time the discussion has waxed furious
Famous astronomers corroborated his discovery
Equally famous ones denied their existence
Lately it is becoming gen erally credited that no such regular and numerous markings occur as Shiaparelli and and Lowell claimed to see
Experiments conducted in the laboratory indicate that the human eye and mind have tendency to connect faint spots and markings by wholly imaginary straight lines
In the case of viewing Mars in tele scope the image is very hazy at best
It literally takes conscious straining of the eye to distinguish even the larger markings
The socalled canals being at the limit of visibility may be subjective imagined rather than objective seen
Photography has failed to reveal the mythical canals
But the claim is made justifiably that un der the best of conditions the eye is more sensitive than the photographic plate so there is still no positive evidence on either side
Perhaps the only sure check on this en grossing question will be when man finds way to traverse space and explore Mars himself
FILTERABLE VIRUSES Editor Science Questions and Answers Ive noticed that the filterable viruses are being called living liquids as in the Farley story recently
Science fiction aside are they truly alive
San Francisco Calif
Strictly speaking the answer is probably no
Filterable viruses seem to be more of the quality of subtle poisons than of living matter
It seems that some diseases like the mosaic disease of the tobacco plant and silkworm jaundice produce lethal substance which is able to interfere with the metabolism of healthy tissue
Unlike cultures of germs the virus is filterable through the finest of porcelain filters indicating that it must have colloidal composition
Whatever the sub stance is which can reinfect tissue with the disease that produced it it is not composed of the germs and microorganisms we know at present
Either its potency is due to in credibly tiny living organisms matched in size by some of the larger molecules or to superpowerful poisons which in undetect able quantities can poison mass of pro toplasm unthinkably greater in mass

BINDER ILLUSTRATION LIKED By Fred Miles Here are orchids for two fine tales in the February issue of THRILLING WONDER STORIES The World in Box by Carl Jacobi and The Ice Entity by Jack Williamson
Though not as good as The Legion of Space The Ice Entity was vastly interesting story
Presented in the same issue as Jacobis stort story it helped to make the best of the four numbers of the rejuvenated Was very delighted to see draving by Jack Binder in this issue
The yarn it illustrated was the third best in my favor for the month
The cover was excellent
Almost photographic in its realism
Keep up the good work
New Providence New Jersey
FEARN THE TOPS By John Baltadonis Fearns story Brain of Venus takes the cake for February as far as Im con cerned
The way it started out thought for sure that the ending was obvious there was waiting for the introduction of the heroine to marry Captain Brant when bango he gets killed
That in itself stunned me but vhen the second hero of the story got killed Ive got to hand it to Fearn for having enough nerve to write story having two heroes and both getting killed
Protoplasmic Station by Paul Ernst wasnt as good as had expected it to be
However it did provide good reading mat ter
Invaders From the Outer Suns by Frank
Long Jr had novel twist
Williamsons Ice Entity was something new
Wandreis Black Fog looked like just another death cloud story at first
Only this time instead of hero and heroine emerging victorious at the end mankind really is doomed
Quite surprise twist
agree with Ronald Armitage on the subject of cartoons
Why not pick better subject
Frankfort Ave Philadel phia Penna
FIRST LETTER By John Hartos Having just finished the February issue of feel that must write you in appreciation
Carl Jacobis story World in Box is the best story in the issue
The others too are good
Zarnak by Max Plaisted is good idea and pleasant variation from the fiction con tent
The December issue rated pretty highly too
Zagats Lanson Screen and The BrainStealers of Mars by John Campbell Jr were among the best in that number
This is the first letter have ever writ ten to any magazine
Center Street Hempstead New York
Readers will be interested to learn that Mr Campbell has written more stories concerning the interplanetary adventures of his two in trepid spacerovers Blake and Penton
The first of these will soon be ready for publication
How about other firstletter writers sending in notes to this department
REQUESTS By John Chapman The February is the best of the four issues published up to now
If you keep improving as you have been youll soon reach the top
Fearns Brain of Venus was unusual
Try to obtain more of his stories
Wandrei comes second with Black Fog These two authors are about the only ones who really know how to end story with wallop
Instead of the routine procedure in which the fairhaired hero saves Earth and lives to win the heroine etc etc
Fearn discarded the hackneyed ballyhoo and reversed the situation so that the hero sacrificed himself to save the entire uni verse
And no heroine either
lU Judgment Sun will be the third Eando Binder story you have published since August
By all means keep up that pace
Binder is without doubt one of science fictions greatest writers and Ill never be tired of reading his stories
Some other authors Id like to see in are Murray Leinster Nat Schach ner Frank Kelly and Rowley Hilliard
The illustrations are great
Marchioni is the king of artists
Keep him and dont bother about securing anyone else unless it would be Paul
Como Ave
Minneapolis Minn Theres another Binder novelette for you next month his best story to date
OVERSEAS OPINION By Youd Although never wrote to the old mag azine am writing now to welcome the old mag back
It was with mingled feel ings that tore the wrapper off your December issue and saw that Paul was gone
Your cover artist is good however and Id like to see him alternate with Paul
Your layout is good
Especially the forecast for the next issue how about Coming Shortly feature
am looking forward to all the stories announced for the next number
The outstanding stories in the December issue were The Lanson Screen the only good story Ive ever read by Zagat and was it good
The BrainStealers of Mars the funniest story Ive read in ages Campbell is worthy successor to Weinbaum
And of course the Weinbaum tale Brink of In finity Galluns Saturns Ringmaster was appealing mainly because of the Uranian professor character
Lets have more stories about him
Would like to see stories by Miller Hamilton Leinster Keller Harris Hil liard Pragnell Williamson and Zagat if he can produce another like The Lanson Screen Desborough Road East leigh Hants England
NOSEGAYS AND BRICKBATS By Norm Sirirsger was very glad to see the reappearance of your magazine on the newsstands al though there is room for improvement

Zagat told an old story with new twist while Cummings and Hamilton took hackneyed but interesting plots and filled their stories with exciting adven tures
So ended the good half of the mag azine
As for the inferior stories they were EarthVenus by Gabriel Wil son
This story was good once but long ago
Well written though taking sixth place
Echols story was formula stuff
Static was too short and dry
Now for some general criticisms
You should try to print serial
novelette should be at least sixteen pages long
Keep your authors away from the timeworn themes
is only published every other month
believe that it should be published monthly or oftener
And here are bouquets
has brought back many famous old authors to science fiction
Cummings Merritt Farley Kline Burks theyre all good
The gen eral run of your stories tend to be written in the principle of story first then science This is vise plan story may be dominant in science and have an entire ly new conception but it will fail to hold the readers attention because it is poorly written and then again story may be well written and fail to click because the plot is too old
Consequently your stories cover larger scope because your require ments as to science content are more tol erant
My ten favorites are Merritt Burroughs Cummings Farley Williamson Burks Leinster Coblentz Verrill and Hamilton
Six of these men write for you
Keep them

WANTS BOOKS ON LIGHT By James Wilhelm have been reader of your magazine for some time and like it very much
have never written to you before but need some information
have been experimenting for some time with light and its peculiarities
Outside of what few instructions came with what equipment have Im still in the dark no pun intended
would like to experi ment with black light infrared and photo electric cells
Also with electricity especially the more startling and amazing phenomena that can be achieved with the proper preparations
would like to know where can get information and equipment for these ex periments

In my estimation the best tale in the issue was Fearns Brain of Venus Of the short stories World in Box is tops

The Reader Speaks is altogether too short
We fellers like to know what others think of know all this is big order to fill but by all means try to enlarge Science Questions and Answers Fifth Street Washington There are seven questions and answers in this issue
By Irving Koskow Although the December issue of THRILLING WONDER STORIES is the best of your three issues thus far there remain some minor imperfections
First and foremost take that comic
strip Zarnak out
Its not only child ish but silly
Please bear in mind that many of your readers are not adolescents and constitute goodly portion of your circulation
The space wasted on Zarnak could be used to advantage in enlarging The Reader Speaks must congratulate you on the other departments and features
Most note worthy of these are Story Behind the Story and Scientifacts BrainStealers of Mars was most novel and interesting of all the stories in the issue
There is but one correction Id like to offer concerning this story
Granted that type of animal such as described is capable of changing its protoplasm given sufficient amount to vork with how could it possibly reproduce space suit or bits of metal which are not or ganic from organic protoplasm
Mutiny on Europa was fine tale on par with Campbells yarn
Fulton Street Brooklyn
How many readers like Zarnak
Theres fmiouH battle going on about the strips merits
Come on Plaisted supporters lets hear from you
What kind of plot would you want Zarnak to have
Your point about the Campbell story is well taken but remember that the thushol did not create the space suits they stole them from the space ship
They could only simulate inorganic substances ex ternally of course

SCIENCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Continued from Page eases credited to the activity of filterable viruses
Such poisons which could grow almost like microbes in new host would be on the order of enzymes feiments which dis solve and change organic matter and in crease at the same time their own amounts
Enzymes are purely chemical nonliving materials
Yet it is still an open question whether the filterable virus is micro microbe culture in which case it would be alive Ed
Note According to data made available just as we were going to press filterable viruses have been discovered to be protein molecules existing on the borderline be tween the living and the nonliving
SKIN PIGMENTATION Editor Science Questions and Answers Albinos are explained as lacking pigmen tation
How does this occur
Can there be albinos of any animal
Hartford Conn
Although no complete survey has been made it is undoubtedly possible that there can be and have been albinos in every species of animal
White blackbirds white crows white swifts white rabbits white rats and such are well known where the original stock is heavily pigmented
In albinos the factors for pigmentation have been lost in the intricate nuclear com binations which occur in the ripening germcells
In the case of an animal with one of the dark pigments melanins it is necessary for ferment tyrosinase to act on pigmentproducing substance called tyrosin
If either factor drops out of in heritance the fertilized eggcell develops into an albino
The phenomenon is com paratively rare because the pigment cells are hardy in the biological sense being closely related to skin cells which are toughest of all
There is also form of albinism which is acquired rather than prenatal
Cases have been observed of animals such as chickens changing from black to white or move rarely of human hair whitening over night
In such cases of false albinism the pigment matter can be found to have moved to new locale as for instance the liver
It is depigmentation rather than nonpigmentation
ASTRONOMy SUPERSTITIOUS
Editor Science Questions and Answers Is there direct connection between the motions of the moon around Earth and Earth around the sun
If so why doesnt our calendar indicate that the true month is onethirteenth of vear
Salt Lake City Utah
There is no mechanical connection between the separate orbital motions of Earth and moon
If the moon were miraculously to increase its speed of revolution by twice it would move outward from Earth but Earth would not change its periods of ro tation and revolution noticeably
By coincidence the moons period of rev olution divides almost exactly thirteen times into year
The ancients tried their best to work the moonperiod into the year with indifferent success
In the heydey of Roman civilization no two people agreed as to the year since the first of the Caesars
Julius Caesar with the aid of competent astronomer established in the calendar bearing his name which is in use today except for the modifications made by Pope Gregory in Julius CaesaPs success in making calendar that lost no more than three days in years was due to his disregarding the period of the moon entirely which is incommensur able with the year
ANiMAL LONGEVITV Editor Science Questions and Answers dont believe personally that cat has nine lives but Ive heard some wild stories of how cats survive all sorts of deaths and lots of people believe in it
Now lets see what scienceeditor would have to say about it besides plain Bah Long Branch
cat has fundamentally one life and one only
One bullet in its brain will kill it as suiely as it would any other creature
But the cat does seem to have special tenacity for that one life
For one thing it has by long evolution ary processes developed to perfection the art of always landing on its feet
This faculty measurably increases its chances for longevity
Then it has those richly in nervated long hairs or whiskers in its cheeks which apprise it of danger in the dark upon contact
Added to this is an ability to see in depths of gloom in vhich most other creatures except owls and bats are totally blind
It also has the homing instinct strongly developed which enables it often to reach safety and shelter when stranded
Physically it has highly devel oped efficient body well protected from teeth to claws
Its senses of smell and hearing are very acute
And lastly it has far more intelligence than is generally sus pected
Its seeming dumbness is camou flage for firstclass thinking organ
All these points in its favor taken to gether give the cat distinct advantage in the grim game of eluding death
It is questionable whether even the anthropoids with their semihuman intelligence have greater survival value than the felines

MAGINATION among scientists is still the priceless ingredient
The wars of the future will be fought if at all in the atomic labora tory
And its safe bet that the har nessing of atomic energy will be dis covered only by accident
Through out the history of science accident has been the important agency respon sible for uncovering the great scien tific wonders
For example in Berthold Schwarz was attempting to find compound for making the philosoph ers stone
All of sudden his table of chemicals exploded on him
Gun powder was discovered
GALVANSS DISCOVERY In an Italian doctor named Luigi Galvans quite by accident came upon dramatic scene which gave us electricity in circuit
Galvani noticed that vhenever his electric machine began to spark between electrodes frogs legs which he had freshly dissected lying on metal plate began simultaneously to twitch as though it were alive
By hanging dozen frogs legs to dry by copper hooks on an iron grille he played with the idea of animation again and the whole line began to move even vithout the aid of the electric machine nearby
Thus cur rent was born
And so it will be in the future
Scientists with imagination and en thusiasm will scoop their more prac ticalminded contemporaries

If per son is actively interested in science fiction he goes to any extremes within reason of course to stimulate interest in the type of fiction he loves
In ray three years of scientifictional activities have employed various methods of introduc ing science fiction to the general public
At school in my English class often devote my oral lessons to sclentifiction
Many of my written compositions are also based on science fiction
Of course there are those who scoff at my choice of reading matter but have interested quite few hitherto antisolencefictionists

There are other ways of promoting science fiction
One method is to have an article pro pounding the interests of science fiction pub lished in the local newspaper

ELIXIR OF DOOM Concluded from page Frankensteins monster it had killed its creator
Again Somers and Anne were si lent awed by their memories
The little flower box stood here before them
The moonlight through the window streamed brilliantly down upon it
Little arena
Small spread of caked dirt with fuzz of tiny grass and forlorn geranium at its center
What amazing realms of smallness lay hid den here
The match still stood with tiny scratch in the dirt beside it
few inches away toward the gerani um the dirt was softer
There was tiny broken mound
Somers mind swept back
worm had poked it self up there and then wriggled away
He bent closer
Even now he could distinguish the body of Toro
speck on the dirt near the upright rnatch stick
And as he stared he saw two tiny black ants struggling over the ridges of the dirt
They came upon the tiny speck
They stood for moment pick ing it apart
And then they carried it away
