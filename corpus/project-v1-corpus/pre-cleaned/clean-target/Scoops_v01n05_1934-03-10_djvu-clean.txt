SEVEN GREAT STORIESdfthe FUTURE Giant EYE to earch the Heavens MARS AS SEEN CROUCH TELESCOPE ELLIPTiGAL MIRBOR WONDERS OF NEW OBSERVATORY BIGANTIC new obtorvaUry which will enable astronomers to obseree and diotcsraph stars million times famler lhan the unaided eye can see is in the oourse of oonstruotien in Texas
The skill of some of the greatest aslronomioal designers in the world has gone Into the construction of the observatory and It is oonfideny expected that its giant eye will observe many new wonders in the Amovable dome
et in diameter and weighing Its tens will house the giant telescope and the siars will be observ by means of mirrors
The sonoh main mirror fourfon disc made of heatrealsting glass the grinding and polishing of which will take two years will pick up the light from the stars and reflect It up to an Mterohangeabla oonvex mirror lor long or short locus
This in tom will reflect through elliptical mirrora to the eyepieces
An observing cradle carried on the girders of the dome will enable observers to use the Instnimimt as Newtonian Telescope or to take pholograplis with the oamera
Speolrograph Room for observing the apaclra of stars IS another feature of the new observatory

The ian longhej
am willing to watch you try Jimmy hithiin
It was elcnn and wicked book on the point sod the man drojiiird in heap limmy bent over him
was out aud likely to be out for some luimiles
Jimmy dragged him into tins middle of lha road and left him
geessing Hint policemui would find bim and would umlHihly take him to tho statijn for some kind of micstioning
There were moments when Jimmy could think very fast indeed
His man had not counted on that Then Jimmy went alraiit np to he door of thesiaistor dark house and nuig be bell
TTra door he noticed was beautiful Joor
like so many in Montmnrire splcudid and iioblo piav of wood sritb some rather iiioe carving on it
So could hone the clung of the bell which waa of the pull variety away te depths of the bouse but nobody answered it
Se rang again and wuitod aud still there was no answer
jwlicemjin wandered along
He iW tho downed mun in the read
He saw Iiinmy ood alBTled to quesikm hits
Jimmy said be spoke iia French
He mnnsged to say that lie knew nollnng in French
Tlie policemsn blew whistle
Aiwther polieamau arrived
Uai wau brought
Front the veiy front of the house the man was whisked nway and Jiinmy breathed ngiun after liaviiig given his name and ludel to ho police
But all tliis had caused some commotion
The police whistle had Leiai heard
Doors openM
Timmy Inrkod in sliadow by tho buautiful door and waited
Tilers was little rhaller
The taxi hod vunislied
Nothing moved iu the strovl
and tlinse who bad opened their donrs began to close them
And llien jeal as Timmy was Ueiiding that Lis lack was out tbe beautiful door of Ihs sinister liouis was rnuiioasly pulled open foot and face pccpetl oiU
For single transfixed seivml liimny stared at that fa wiiiln the owner of tho face aoeiug him dimly iu ibedurkncrs etured nt him
And thus they stood immobilo roeogiiiabig one another uusblo tn movo from sbetT amazoment
For bis wan Baldy
tbe buldheailei killer whom Jiinmy tiail firet ancountered on the lonely aaltuigs of tbe Essex coast
THE FIGHT ON THE STAIRS was Baldy right rnongli
Jimmy muved Irst and Jimmy moved decisively
Ho tempt forward
HU rigtit band went nniler Baldys cfain and got grip of that emootli persons tbruat grip which dug thamb and finnrs into Caldys windpipe with agunisiug effectivcuoiis and rendered lliQ suave tongue ailent
Daldy was dragged forward on to the door step lie tried to hit Jimmy but the nip on nia ttiroat tightened bis eyes jumped for ward ns though paslicd from belimd and hU tongue Inllfd bwribly
Baldy was as near being choked as ever had bccu in nil his evil life
Listen hissed Jimmy
Is my frioud in here
Nod if he is
IU have your lifa if you dont answer Budy vontrived to nod
Jimmy Toarhed post him and gently puilod the dnnr to witba out actually intebing iL Then he dragged Ualdy two or three paces up thfl itrrel and into deep and dark doorway
The relentlesa grip on bia threat had duced Baldy to belplcsanm and fear

Yes but night Timmy ignored he interrup tion
What ronm is lie in
The top room at the back
Baldy speka eiiltenly
At least he was when came to the door
TVhat docs Ihel meauT asked Jimmy
Baldv heuUted
He had avidently saiil jnuro limn be intetided
Jinuny ntercilesaly hammered him on the side of the head
He could not forget that dyiiie man who crawled to his miignlew door and he luid no lyn lathy at all for Hatily
Give me chance sobbed Baldy
Dont keep hiUing me for lienrens sake

Come cm
Spunk up

TImts all
Iwci of them wont up for liini as came to tho door
Werl iieard the police whistle unit we wondered what it miglit see
They think be knows soinclhiog and they want to know wbal it is
Now Im going into that houeo HalJv and there arc six wen in it
gasped Baltly
Tlmifl liad Inrk for them
grinned Jimmy
Youre coming with me and in ordrr to cpsnro that my entry is anooticed youre iming to call ont as we go through tlm door YonHl vaU out to one of your friends by luime and tell Iiim street flsht was tak ing place that the police Iiave cleaned it up and that everytliing is now OK
If you want to apeak Kreuen to him you ran because esn tallc the Ungnage likn uative and will undcrland all you say
The dnzrd ldy ms propelled into the street never doubting Jimmys audacious elaim to compicta knowledge of the Prencti langTUigr Tlioy reached tho dHorsIed door of tlie ainistor house Baldy slepMd la at JiirmyK side and Jimmy nudged him bo ycUed Oeorget
Georges voice from somewhere in be house yelled back Comment Its all right cried Baldy
scrap in the street
The coppers liave gone spoke ho language of Gic inilcr btnila vards
and Jimmy did not understand single word bu eaiil but be na able to nppreriata the reply of Oeorgs which was short and easy
Cztl ban Whereupon Timmy gently pulled Baldy baikwHids to the dnenstBp oncu morn and sacked him as viriously as be lisd eocked the slayer of mile Gevault
Ho left Baldy ia the street to be pickeil up by the police and tJius provide tluio with dual mystery and he gently closed the door luid stood alone in tho dim light of the rather intpoiing and wide entrance passageway
it wss na he stood thus tlml he hoard voice
The voice was singiug
At toast the owniT of the voice would probably have liad the aiidscity to call it singing
Actually It auundod liko an electric tram taking steep curve
It sang song to woliknowc tune song that was snng when Jimmy was piattlmg nurspiy rhymes

Moreover once tlM iionnet had emerged she bounded for ward ami went scudding along at speed of something like Uiirty or forty miles an hour

John pulled at his steeringwheel but it runda no impression on the cars direction
It was hurtling straight forward absolutely out of his control
Tbo reason John polled so hard at tho steeriugwheel was lcnse ahead of him was small boat
