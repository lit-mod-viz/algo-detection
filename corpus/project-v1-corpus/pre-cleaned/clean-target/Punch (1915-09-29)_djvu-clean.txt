SOUND VALUE THE TRUE VALUE OF ANYTHING IS MEASURED BY THE SATISFACTION IT BESTOWS IN RELATION TO THE SACRIFICE IT DEMANDS
The public too often confuses value with price
Price is only one of the two factors that determine value
The other the worth of the goods offered
The real worth of cotton fabrics is measured by their actual resistance to wear or wash and their permanency of finish
It is impossible for the public to determine these qualities except by actual service or by certain identification and positive guarantee
That is why Tootals inaugurated their famous policy of selvedge marking or otherwise branding their wide range of superior pro ducts listed on this page and of guaranteeing their real worth
By thus enabling the public instantly to identify any of these guaranteed lines on any drapers counter all risk of unsound material finish or dye is eliminated and permanent satisfaction assured

HEALTH System of Exercise for Everyone from Infancy to Old Age
RATIONAL exercise is the first step towards better health
It is what Nature prescribes to keep the body fit
PMuIler Royal Danish Engineers has re duced exercise to so fine point of simplicity as almost to give new meaning to the word
His System is exercise without drudgery
It is scientific easy delightful and suited to old and middleaged persons of either sex as well as to the young
No appliances of any kind are required
The whole series of movements occupies only few minutes daily and there is no risk of strain
The responsiveness of the body to the exercises is immediate because they exercise all the vital organs and every muscle of the body
The series includes self massage with the hands novel feature which produces delightful exhilarating glow removes and prevents indi gestion and constipation promotes circulation tones the nerves and makes the skin clear and healthy
The Bodybending and twisting Exercises performed without diffi culty even by people unused to ex ercise strengthen the muscles of the trunk and massage the inner organs ensuring functional effici ency
As result the acids which cause gout rheumatism and simi lar ailments are removed from the system
Stoutness is overcome by the discipline of the body under the Muller System because the exer cises restore the entire physical organism to its normal or natural condition of health
For the same reasons the System corrects ex cessive thinness
The Muller System requires no prolonged or painful effort
The movements are varied pleasant to perform and adaptable to every degree of physical strength
It is therefore method of health exercise keenly appreciated by ladies who desire shapely and graceful figure clear skin and the cure by natural means of the many ailments which frequently impair the picture of health
Why this is accomplished by the practice of the Muller System is explained in booklet The Royal Road to Health and Beauty copy of which will be sent post free to all lady enquirers

Evidence concerning the System
Dr JAMES SWANSON MA MB CM FRFPS
Glasgow have no hesitation in saying that no living man has done more to promote clean healthy life among the men and women of England than you have done
wish you long life and strength to continue your good work of salvation by attention to the body
THE SUNDAY TIMES To sum up the Muller System is undoubtedly an allround comprehensive method of regularly exercising every muscle of the body in minimum amount of time and that briefly spells health
Mr HUGH de SELINCOURT writing in The Daily Mail After three months regular discipline discipline mind you accessible to every man mans body changes almost be yond belief
Do it and you will see
Do it for the sake of your health and the health of your children and your childrens children
Do it for the sake of England who wants tough healthy men
THE TIMES Lieutenant Muller is good advertise ment of his system for he has fine well proportioned figure his muscles are not developed to excess and it would not be difficult to find many young men in the Army or at the Universities of larger muscular proportions
THE OBSERVER There is no terrible development of thigh or biceps
You are only supple and upright only healthier and happier less cross and less nervous only nicer to live with cleaner pluckier and more selfcon fident
ARMY NAVY CHRONICLE It is essentially system of home gymnastics suitable for all ages of men and women
It is simplicity itself and very slight acquaintanceship will convince those who try it of the benefit to be derived from it
It should be introduced into every school and we should like to say every family in England
SVENSK DAM TIDNING the wellknown Swedish Ladies Magazine Most earnestly do we recommend Lieut
Mullers System to the whole world of women
Daily baths systematic exer cises and massage and exposure to fresh air and sunshine are not only means to health but also to beauty and natural vivacity
Sir ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE One becomes fit and keeps fit by carry ing out Lieut
Muilers System which is natural course of exercises without the use of musclestraining instruments causing no great strain and resulting in no after collapse
Dr VALENTINE KNAGGS in his work Indigestion its Cause and Cure The Muller exercises are probably the best devised for remedying constipation and indigestion

ONE OF THE BULLDOG BREED
Aa indent is wondrously perfected device for whitening the hair of the officer involved
Mr Arnold Bennett in The Daily News
Lieut and ActingQuartermaster Denton Smy the sat in his office prepared for the nerveracking process of filling in the daily indent
Summoning up that courage which is instinctive in the British officer he opened Army Book and wrote the name of his unit Bty
th Bde
on the top line
Without resting after the mental strain involved he filled in the word One in the space for No
of days rations required and again without pause filled in the date Sept th in the space for Date when rations are required
Many men would have taken rest at this point but Lieut
Denton Smy the was made of sterner stuff
He only paused long enough to dip his pen in the ink and then entered the number in the space for No
of officers warrant officers noncom
officers and men and the number in the space for No
of rations required
The unflinching sense of duty which characterises our officers was never better exemplified than in the case of Lieut
Denton Siny the
Even after the exhausting mental effort required to calculate that men would require rations he would not yield to exhaustion
Again dipping his pen in the ink with the same deter mination with which he would have thrust bayonet through German he put the number in the space provided on the form for No
of horses and again with no outward sign of brain fatigue he calculated the number of rations required for horses and entered the number in the space provided
Then gathering together what remained of his superb energy he signed his name at the foot of the document and laid down his pen
Here one would like to he able to say that he was free to rest to go on leave for week and attended by loving members of bis family or by one even dearer than they to recuperate his jaded brain and shattered tissues
But the Army regulations are callous and no such happy ending is possible unless we tamper with truth
The gallant officer had laid down his pen but his task was still incomplete
He had yet to detach the indent from the book
This done he rose and with supreme effort opened the door and said Corporal send this to the Supply Office
Then he collapsed
THE SIGNAL
Concerning the multitudinous charms and stately sweet nesses of Audrey much might be written but as this is to be an article as opposed to book and as young goddesses being but human may be spoilt by too candid worship will here confine myself to her single fault
Audrey is romantic nay more she is mediaeval
When recently approached her with certain momentous question she was fresh from halfadozen versions of the Tristram and Iseult legend and to say that she was full of it is to put the case feebly
The sick lover was to infer you remember from the white or black sail on the good ship Sivan whether his affaire was going smoothly or quashed for ever and Audrey proposed to tell me my fate by modernised treat ment of the idea
After clear week for reflection she would meet me by appointment and if she came clad in brilliant hues might go to the jewellers at once for the ring but if the tints of her attire were neutral all would be over and could interview the chemist with an order for strychnine at my earliest convenience
The fateful night arrived and Audreys ensemble flung me into mingled triumph and despair
Even to my dull masculine eyes the run of her tints was appallingly neutral but there was one solitary gleam of hope
She wore on her breast screaming red rosette which would have spoilt the beauty of any ordinary girl
Poor tonguetied coward lacked the nerve to insist on an answer outright and we proceeded with the agenda of the evening which consisted of theatre modest Warsupper and taxi home
trust never again to pass through such torments of doubt and suspense
At last as we stood on the steps of The Lindens where Audrey dwells could no longer silence my anguish
Tell me dearest whispered hoarse with emotion tell me and put me out of my pain
Are these tints to be taken as brilliant or neutral
You silly boy she replied as if could dress in bright colours nowadays
Why you cant get anything in that line fit to make up for love or money
great wave of hope surged over me
But this thing cried pointing to the scarlet abomina tion on her breast it means
she whispered
It dead secret and papa would disinherit me if he found out
stole his Civic Volunteer brassard and made temporary rosette of it
That seemed the handiest way to show what mean My memory has as yet failed to reconstruct fully the next whirling moment but it is thought from the undeniable dustiness of my knees on the following morning that behaved in the best sixteenth century style
Audrey informs me that special on duty outside Menaggio four doors away paused as if in doubt whether to arrest me or not and at last gave furious stamp and strode off in disgust
It may be that long years had dimmed the memory of his own youth
Or possibly his feet were cold

THE SHIRKER
had never beaten Petherby not that he is billiard expert but merely that am rabbit
masterly series of two nursery cannons varied some times by and very occasionally coupled with hazard is all aspire to
Peth erby on the other hand can generally manage to score something every time and not infrequently runs into some of the humbler double figures
The truth is that do not possess the discriminating eye of Digglb for the niceties of angles
But have one facility of which am proud and to which shall allude later
few weeks ago at Petherbys house found him in one of his rare off moods
These off moods of his generally signify that he beats me by mere or so in up instead of by the more customary margin of or more
But on the night in question Petherby was playing so shockingly and so brilliantly on two successive visits to the table had played for safety and scored clear board each time that at length was to his
It was my turn to play
My first stroke though not exactly yielding the result had in mind was nevertheless most satis factory and comprehensive one
made cannon off the red and then my ball and Petherbys mysteri ously disappeared down different pockets
Petherby applauded with the butt of his cue upon the floor
Good shot Sir
he remarked sar castically
What pity it didnt all come off
All come off
said with hauteur
Why it did all come off much better than could have hoped for even in my most sanguine moments
What do you mean
Oughtnt the red to have done something gone down pocket for instance
Then you would have won the game
As it is Petherby said sternly re member please that there are three balls six pockets and certain laws of coincidence which must operate at times
In that stroke distinctly see the finger of Providence
You are not intended to win this game
Just look at the position of the red
The red was up the table close to the left cushion
To pot it was an im possibility as far as my limited tech nique was concerned but felt that by careful aiming so as to hit the paint without disturbing the ivory as ex pressively put it when narrating the incident to Pilkington could manage to run in
So took deliberate aim and pressed my cue gently forward
Slowly slowly my ball trickled up the table straight as die all the way
It was only few inches from the red and still running true when the electric lights went out
At the same instant loud report was heard followed immediately by second and third
cried Petherby
Where my umbrella
There other game afoot cried as fumbled for my cigarettelighter
The wick flamed up
hurried to the top of the table
My ball was in Get back Belgium
Get it back
You wait till yon chaps campin oh the ill gets out there
If they cant get it back no other way they ll pinor it
the pocket
shouted joyfully
Game to me
On the contrary said Petherby craning his neck over my shoulder it my game
You ve given three away
That red never budged hairsbreadth swear
couldnt possibly have missed
was dead on the edge of the red when the lights went out
Can you solemnly affirm you heard the balls click
Of course not you ass replied
How could through that beastly firing
On the other hand did you see me miss
How could in the dark
he answered testily
Exactly said
couldnt hear you couldnt see
As you maintain that the red hasnt moved the fairest thing will be for me to play the shot again
Bo you happen to have candle on you
There was knock at the door and the servant entered
If you please Sir she said the police sergeant has just been and said youre wanted at once at the station
must go immediately said Petherby struggling into his jacket
What nuisance these Zepp raids are interfering with ones amusements in this way
Eeally Half jiffy
cried as Petherby moved to the door
Wait while play that shot again
Anybody would think there was panic from your positively indecent haste
Sorry said Petherby edging off but duty is duty
Where would my crest of five oysters rampant gules on plat du jour argent be if my knightly ancestors had preferred billiards to duty
So long
There precedent for it retorted
How about Drakes game of bowls
But Petherby was half way down the staircase
yelled after him as realised that the issue must remain un decided
But stay Mary said would you take this lighter and hold it close to the red ball so
Now want you to watch the red ball carefully and tell me if this white one which am going to play touches it
placed my own ball back in baulk took long and careful aim and then
somehow managed
to miscue
No Sir it didnt hit the red one said Mary as my ball stopped few inghes from the baulkline
pretended to heave sigh of re lief
Thank goodness
Properly to explain the objoct and effect of that stroke Mary would necessitate my using technicalities which you would probably not under stand
think under the circum stances you had better not mention to Mr Petherby that required your assistance
He might consider it an abuse of his hospitality
Very good Sir said Mary as she exchanged the cigarette lighter for halfacrown

SINCE the Winter of the best quality heavyweight khaki has increased in price nearly and in consequence any amount of secondgrade material which is totally unfit to stand the excessive strain cf Active Sefvice is now on the market
feel cannot emphasise loo strongly to inexperienced Officers the utter futility of equipping themselves with any but the finest quality khaki that money can buy
The House of Pope and Bradley is determined to maintain the reputation it has made and refuses to supply Officers with any material which they cannot absolutely guarantee
The prices charged represent the minimum at which uniforms of the best quality can be obtained and they are reasonable because the House is cne of the large buyers in London

The Mistake
There is no need to specify the res taurant
It is famous for its English joints and is just now much visited by officers on leave who wish to eat together just as certain subterranean grillroom is the favourite resort of officers on leave when as not in frequently happens they entertain the other sex
To one of the tables thoughtfully provided with so many chairs that secrets have ever been out cf the ques tion here came two lieutenants very obviously oil duty for brief season and rejoicing in their liberty and he who was acting as host and bad long since settled all doubts as to what their meal was to consist of flung out the order for roast beef almost before he was seated flung ib out too as though expecting as instant response from the stall as he gets from his men all unmindful that this restaurant has leisurely processes of its own carefully acquired and perfected during many many years
Meanwhile the saddle of mutton was wheeled to my side and some unusually attractive slices were separated from it by knife like razor and laid before me
saw the lieutenants eyeing my plate with illconcealed enw but beef was in their minds
Beef had been in their minds for toilsome weeks and they did not betray their friend
At least not wholly but fancy the host wavered
wonder he began and said no more for the beef arrived on its little wagon and their plates were soon covered with it
It was not one of the most successful of the houses joints and again caught their eyes directed towards my saddle
Was it too late
their expression silently asked
Yes it was
Besides they had come there to eat beef
Nothing like beef
The lieutenants attacked with vigour but they still glanced muttonwards now and then meditatively between bites
Then the host spoke
It was in an undertone hut heard because at this restaurant as have said there are no secrets
wonder if we oughtnt to have bad saddle he murmured
It looks jolly good said the other
They ate on
Do you think the beef is absolutely tophole today
the host asked
ve known it better replied the other
They ate on
rather wish wed had mutton said the host
After all saddle you know
It not too common
Beef we can always get in some form or other not like this of course but beef whereas saddle saddles rare
wish you reminded me of the saddles here
Wed settled on beef long ago said the other performing prodigies of valour with his knife and fork
know but it as foolish not to look at the bill of fare
should have thought of it then
They still ate heartily
No chance of getting here again for goodness knows bow long said the host
The other dismally agreed
Could you manage slice of saddle after this
the host asked after busy interval
Sorry couldnt replied the other through mouthful which lion would not disdain
dont believe could either said the host
What bore

CAMP QUARTERMASTERING
Matilda rather misled me on the question of buying meat
She said that there was no particular trick about it that all you have to do is to go to place where they sell meat and buy it taking care that you get the right weight and that the man does not throw too much bone and bits of sheeps head and cows feet on the scale
She said that purveyor of meat is easily identified because he wears peculiar blue costume and that the only other person you can possibly mistake for him is wounded soldier
got into the right kind of place first time and said should like to see some meat
The man didnt take any notice of me until he had finished cutting off and wrapping up in newspaper lump of meat for readymoney customer
Then he said What kind of meat
Beef and mutton and such like things
The butcher affectionately slapped the piece of meat which he had been carving and said Thats nice piece of steak
How much meat have you got there
About five pounds weigh it for you
think shall want rather more than that
He fetched down quite largo piece of meat off hook weighed it and said it was twentytwo pounds
was thinking of buying larger piece than that said
How much was you wanting
The piece had in mind should weigh between three and four thousand pounds
The eager look which came into his eyes was quickly succeeded by something akin to fear as he went to the door to make sure the policeman was taking his usual afternoon nap in the neighbourhood
If you was wanting to buy meat can sell it you but if you was looking for flock of sheep or herd of oxen admit havent got em in stock
dont necessarily ant to take it all with me said
What with my boy leaving me and my assistant joining the Army havent got time to waste joking
Perhaps you was thinking of giving party
No wasnt just wanted some meat but see you arent accustomed to serve large families and better try elsewhere
suppose it possible to buy meat for battalion somewhere in this town
If you want to buy meat for the Army you have to go to the meat market
The meat market is dull place the mention of thousands of pounds of meat doesnt excite the inhabitants in the least and they were rather bored with my little order however they condescended to deliver the stuff for me after totting it up in sheep and oxen
In spite of the fact that had the vinegar and more than one kind of meat both Matilda and the Quarter masterSergeant thought that the men would expect still greater variety and under protest added few things like bread jam and cheese
avoided small tradesmen in making these pur chases as they are so suspicious and only dealt with people who had the capital to carry decentsized stock
When the War Office heard about the things that Matilda and the Quarter masterSergeant had persuaded me to buy they naturally got jealous and started sending out circulars to say that they werent going to put up with any competition with their camps and that all camps without their name on were spurious and contrary to law
Of course didnt worry about the War Office because know that their printed circulars dont mean anything
and are only sent out to do the printers and the postoffice turn but the Adjutant and our Commandant who is in the regular army and doesnt understand War Office humour seemed to think that we ought to scratch the camp
They got the idea that had let myself into some kind of mess by what they were pleased to term my premature purchase of goods and the idea seemed to amuse them until explained that had bought all the goods in their names and that when the Corps funds were exhausted they would be personally responsible for the balance
So they went to talk to the War Office about it and met all the other Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants up there on the same errand
When the War Office found how unpopular their circular had made them and how they couldnt move about without falling over Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants they said they didnt object to camps being held if the GOC
of the various districts didnt object
Some people who took the War Office literally wrote to the GOC
of the respective districts where they proposed to camp and got leave which was then cancelled by the War Office
For myself took no such risk and as neither the War Office nor the GOC
of any district found out about our camp we didnt do any harm to anyone but ourselves and we only caught little things like rheumatism and indigestion
If anyone does find out about it shall apologise for my mis take and trust to his being too busy to do anything further in the matter
The camp was rather success we got most of the tents to stand up and some of them kept the rain out includ ing those that mattered mean of course mine and theCommandants and the Adjutants
By marking all the things Goods for Troops persuaded the railway company to deliver most of our provender in the belief that they were helping the Government who are among their best customers in these days
showed the Government mark on the tents to the railway people and they werent to know any more than was when bought them that it was the condemned mark
The vinegar didnt go so well as had expected and had good deal left on my hands in spite of the fact that got quite lot off in the shape of claretcup which retailed in the canteen
Some of the meat rounded on me and was accorded military funeral but not enough to make fuss about
had to pledge locally what was left of the Commandants and the Adjutants credit to make up for the unused vinegar and defective meat but there has been no trouble on that score up to now as they wont know about it until the bills come in and by that time shall either be on permanent leave or else have enlisted
Late produced upon the scene Mean as what you re meant to mean Manufactured and absurd Maimed and miserable word While live you shant prevail Mongrel docked of half your tail

Extracted prom ihb Diary os Toby MP
House of Commons Tuesday st September Introducing his first Bud get McKenna scored double record
In respect both of income and ex penditure he had to deal with the biggest of long list
The speech ex pounding it was the briefest
Marshalling multitude of figures from the extra halfpenny in the pound in the price of sugar up to the million pounds representing esti mated expenditure of the year his mastery of facts was so complete his explanation so lucid that the story was as easy to follow as an ordi nary nursery tale
Time was during the prime of Gladstone at the Treas ury and with his successors in later years when exposition of Budget was regarded as opportunity for great oratorical feat
Mr thought nothing of occupying five hours finishing up with peroration almost worth an additional penny in the pound on the income tax
No selfrespecting Chancellor of the old school would think of omitting to deck his business statement with classical quotation much appreciated below the Gangway
This habit led to first step in downfall of Bob Lowe
Allured by the tag Ex luce lucellum he invented tax upon matches with intent to label the boxes with the motto
In the end as everyone knows he had to remodel his Budget leaving out the obnoxious tax label and all
McKennas speech began without exordium finished without peroration and no single sentence rose above the Spartan simplicity of the Multiplication Table
Only approach to departure from this level was when he mentioned the dizzy height at which expenditure now flies
He thereupon declared his confidence that House and country were prepared to support the Government in bearing whatever measure of taxation is deemed necessary now and he ominously added in the future for the successful prosecution of the War
hearty cheer confirmed this assur ance
Cheerfulness was indeed the prevail ing note of historic occasion
Fresh burden of taxation imposed enormous
Affects every class from the consumer of halfounces of tea and quarters of pound of sugar to the hapless millionaire who out of his modest in come of hundred thousand pounds year will be called upon to contribute to the State the sum of more than onethird of the whole
This of course in addition to his share of in direct taxation
As the Member for Sark says Lloyd George chastised the taxpayer with whips McKenna lays on with scorpions
And yet no murmur is heard
In November last Lloyd George imposed fresh taxation esti mated to bring in revenue of millions
On the top of that McKenna levies new taxes which in full effec tive year will increase the revenue by little short of millions
big bill but it will be met uncom plainingly with any further charges that may presently be necessary for carrying on the War to its inevitable end

Jimmys Uncle is coming
But perhaps you know
The telegraph boy told Jimmy as he was bringing the telegram he was coming by the three oclock train the telegraph boy said Jimmys Uncle is Colonel didnt tell you
and Jimmys mother hadnt seen him for years and years and longer than that Jimmy says not since she was in India
Jimmys Uncle used to know Jimmys father quite well because you see they had been brothers and Jimmys Uncle knew all about Jimmys father winning the Victoria Cross in India but you havent got to talk about that or Jimmy will fight you really mean not pretend
Jimmy says his Uncle has got piece of shrapnel in him and they wont let him stay at the Front because it hasnt burst yet and that why he is coming to see his mother Jimmy says the shrapnel might burst at any time and then it would blow hole ten feet deep in the ground but it would ease his Uncle because he has to walk very quietly and not get excited now
It because of the time fuse they put in them Jimmy says and you can hear it ticking
It makes his Uncle very wary and he has to avoid certain things at mealtimes which are not easily digested because the doctor says the shrapnel is quite enough
Jimmy has seen the porter at the station and he has promised to stop the train you do it by the bylaws Jimmy says
Jimmy told the porter he expected his Uncle would give him some rupees if he looked after the luggage well and the porter took Jimmy to see his he grew them in plot of ground quite close to the line when he wasnt busy cleaning the station lamps
He asked Jimmy if his Uncle soaked his in paraffin before sowing you do it be cause of the sparrers
The porter knew all about India he told Jimmy that theHoodans out there lived on rice pudding and it was very hot there because of the degrees of longitude which were very warm in those parts
The porter hadnt been there not himself but he had read good deal when he wasnt busy cleaning the station lamps
He said he often thought about India because he couldnt abear rice pudding
He said Jimmy might safely leave his Uncle to him
Jimmy went to bed early so as to give the next day chance
His mother nearly spoilt the day before it came because she put out his best sailor suit for him to wear and gave him three pennies to have in his pocket but not to spend
He said his Uncle would think it was Sunday and he put his head under the bedclothes to show what he thought of her
However he let her hold his hand tight for an hour and ten minutes before he went to sleep and when she came to look at him some time later he only smiled in his sleep when she gently removed his feet from the pillow and placed his head there once more
It took the day long time to break and Jimmy was glad when he heard the birds tidying up to get ready for it
He looked out of the window the day seemed very damp and as if it wanted airing so he got back to bed
It was eight oclock and the day was up and dressed and being busy when he next awoke
Jimmy had his mother at the station in good time and they had read all the PUNCH OB THE LONDON CHARIVARI

Jimmy says his Uncle looked very fierce when he arrived at the station and saw his mother
It made his mother cry and she wouldnt speak to him and that only made his Uncle grow fiercer and redder in the face
Jimmy says he thought the shrapnel was going to burst
Jimmy says his Uncle didnt take any notice of him although he kept on saluting him as hard as he could
Then his Uncle turned on him and glared at him and asked him what the dickens he meant standing there looking so much like hisfather
Jimmy said it made his mother very angry and she said Dont Tom dont and cried worse than ever
Jimmy says he clenched his fists and was going to give his Uncle the cowards blow when his Uncle turned his back on him and told the porter not to stand scratching his head like an idiot
Jimmy says the porter was only saluting all the time but he wasnt used to it and every time he got his hand to his head he forgot what he set out to do and scratched his head instead
Jimmy says they drove home in cab and neither his Uncle nor his mother said word to each other all the way they were so cross
Jimmy says his Uncle had bad cold and kept blowing his nose and every time he did it the cabhorse gave jump
Jimmy says his Uncle behaved better after tea
He wasnt so fierce so he asked him to show him his wound but his Uncle said it was under his binder and he couldnt
After the teathings had been put away they all three went into the draw ingroom to look at the large framed photograph of Jimmys father
Jimmy says they each held one of his hands and he had to bite his lip because they hurt
Jimmy says his Uncle didnt think much of the photograph
He just said He was man Mary man then he went very annoyed in the face clicked his heels saluted very hard and turned away
Jimmy says it made him feel quite angry with his Uncle and he went and climbed up on the top of the coalhouse in his best clothes on purpose and he wouldnt come down until his Uncle had promised to be good and not to make his mother cry
Jimmy says his Uncle gave him his word as an officer and they got on better after that
Jimmy said his prayers to his Uncle that night and he let him know what he thought of him
He asked that his Uncle might be made better man
His mother said Oh Jimmy
but his Uncle understood for he said Amen to that old chap

FEEDING THE NATION
Up with that lawn
Over with those flowerbeds
Such were the clarion cries of last March and the family flung themselves into the work of destruction with genuine patriotic ardour
In couple of days we the Medhurst family well known in this suburb as the people who hire motor cars no longer possessed garden
We had house and frightfulness
Still it was grand work
appointed the two youngest children Worm Gatherers in Ordinary with the occa sional rank of Earwig Squasher because although can plant seeds with anybody the handling of reptiles is simply not my sort of work
It was the one profession which did not include in the list of my sideaccomplishments for the National Register
My wife Mrs Medhurst known as the woman with four hats was given rake
Let us leave it at that
fell over it often
Jacqueline Medhurst who is now three and can say for Jacqueline gathered weeds and sang at her work
Yes yes know that it was charm ing of her but it must be pointed out that she is ac quainted with but one song and knows but two lines of that
They go like this ve got ripping little motor car And ve got yacht
Pay someone to sing those two lines into your ears for six hours on end
Everyone ought Nothing came up but kept on look ing despite certain scornfulness in the home circle
But had the laugh of everyone in the end
The seeds came up
My pride and joy in the little seed lings was however not longlived
The critics arrived
Always in life everyone is happy till the critics appear
The first of them in this case was my ridiculous and pompous fatherinlaw who after mumbling coarsely about greengrocery burst into rude guff aws because said he my celery the wellknown garden esculent should have been pricked off long ago
sneered rather hotly and said other people had other yiews about the correct period for pricking off whatever that Proprietor of boot shop tries to boom stock which the war has made unsaleable
forget what was insulted next
But they nearly all caught it
My wifes brother damned the broad beans and was foolish enough to offer himself for slaughter by inquiring if Id ever heard of blight
Then near rela tion of mine sorry to say fell fiercely upon my cauliflowers which he bitterly complained were cramped
Broccoli caught it too so did the parsley and even the radishes did not go scath less
was ashamed of course but having created my vegetables swore stand by them come what may
We would be misunderstood together
Then came the period of our annual holiday by the sea
It was wrench but consoled myself with the reflection that my plants
would do their best for me in my absence
They as
much as whispered it to me hen gave them their fare well watering
The weeks passed away wearily
got everything that could for the nation out of the sea shrimps several prawns two eel one minia ture dab half and on one glorious day seven mackerel hire of boat man lines hooks worms the thing you wind the lines on and piece of string to tie fish up coming to os
Still it wasnt like growing things and the day of our return was der Tag for me
Frankly was knocked
You ought to have seen that garden
Everything had grown furiously everything was much bigger
Nothing had stopped
But here must strike note of sorrow
With one brave to try it before reading any further
Tried it
Yes isnt it
Well we got the seeds in
They only cost two shillings Somebodys Monster Gift Parcel but had to pay one shilling for postage as the potatoes made the parcel heavy
Still didnt grudge that as there seemed to be an astonishing number of seeds
In fact when we had filled our garden there were packet of Early to Come peas another of Dwarf Kidney Beans and yet third of Bobbies Champion Leeks left over
mention this in case anyone would like to buy the surplus
They re still all right except the peas which have been played with by Alastair Medhurst and the bean bag which is frayed along one edge
No beans have escaped mind but the bag has unquestionably depreciated will allow for this
After the seeds were all in used to look at them good deal that is to say looked at the soil which covered them
might be that anyway mine was new variety and had arranged to prick off that day if not interrupted by callers
And when he gone pricked them off because remembered you dont eat the green stuff at the end
But then they stopped growing
There followed an attack upon my onions
The solicitor next door caught sight of them one Sunday morning and putting his head over the wall asked if they really were onions
said they were hardly onions but had certain onionimity
expected ata vistic tendencies however
He grinned because he has been to public school and said that ought to have asked him before trying onions
apologised and offered to dig them out and begin again
He told me that he was only trying to be friendly and that never get an onion if couldnt take tip
And then he went indoors noble exception nothing was eatable
The greenstuff was overrun with cater pillars and slugs the roots were rotting the beans were tough and coarse the peas were hard peas and the radishes were huge and woolly
What remained
My potatoes
My brave plucky persevering potatoes
They proved my only standby
There are plenty of them and the family is good enough to approve them
In fact we have more than we can eat
At the sideentrance have hung an unob trusive board bearing the legend Med hursts Middlings and charge one halfpenny under market price
So now am known in our suburb as the man who sells potatoes

MY DEAR SIR
He was small stout round man with bulging eyes and loose moist lips evidently an inquisitive gossipy fellow and he had been talking very optimistically about the War and very pessimistically about the taxation fortifying himself as he proceeded with quotations from the daily papers of which he had purchased every available specimen
could see that he was dying to tell me all about himself and at last out it came
He looked furtively round the railway compartment as if to assure himself that nobody was lurking in the rack or under the seats and spoke
presume he said that you dont know who really am
Ho said dont
havent got beyond classing you as friendly traveller
Thanks he said but didnt mean that
Of course dont want to push it on you
only wondered if you got any idea of what my work in life is
It unique business and keeps me hard at work can tell you
Look here he produced one of his papers and pointed out to me Mr Lloyd Georges letter what do you think of that
Very telling said distinguished by all the fire and eloquence and innocence for which is famous
Yes he said it pretty thing
Well that me
How do you mean that me
Dont you see its written to constituent
Well the constituent
My dear Sir cried congratulate you
To be Welshman is great thing to live in Carnarvon is gift from heaven and to be constituent of the Minister of Munitions must be the summit of earthly felicity and seized his hand and shook it warmly
Lord love you he said disengaging himself how you do jump at conclusions
Im no Welshman ve never been near Carnarvon and of course in technical sense not constituent of Lloyd Georges
an accom modation constituent that all
Generally corres pondent ve done lot of work for Balfour in that line but this time thought try new touch and so turned myself into constituent
Its gone off splendidly hasnt it
Ye es said but dont quite Dont you see

Oh that easy
We get the originals of the letters and after time we sell them mostly in America
There big market for that sort of thing there

NEW WAY WITH OLD CLOTHES
Men can save by having fewer changes of costume and by spend ing less on golfing or holiday suits or other clothes for occasional wear by having their suits and overcoats cleaned and repaired instead of buying new ones by spending less on gloves and ties and by having still serviceable boots mended instead of buying new ones
Why we must Save and Sow
Parliamentary Savings Committee
In tranquil antebellum days when ordering suit Involved no fiscal problems that were serious or acute My wardrobe was constant source of family dispute
Against my passion for old clothes my estimable wife Supported by my daughters waged
neverending strife It was indeed almost the only worry of my life
They used to hide away my old unfashionable tweeds Oblivious of my comfort and regardless of my neads They banned my pipe but never once objected to my weeds
My ancient ties of faded dyes excited their disdain My threadbare dinnerjacket caused them veritable pain And they criticised my boots in language less polite than plain
They heaped sarcastic obloquy upon my caps and hats They made me birthday presents of the most expensive spats And the latest thing in handkerchiefs in collars and cravats
In short in halfadozen ways they diligently biffed My laudable intentions to promote domestic thrift Until the struggle threatened to produce serious rift
But War though vilely fruitful in sorrow and distress For one small salutary change am inclined to bless At last am allowed perfect latitude in dress
My ancient clothes misshapen boots disreputable ties No longer find disfavour in my wifes and daughters eyes But on the contrary evoke their warmest eulogies
Nay better still themselves released from giddy Fashions goad They follow me with docile steps along the frugal road That leads to perfect freedom from the tyranny of Mode
Retreats for Army Chaplains
The value to the spiritual work of chaplains with the forces in the fighting line of day spent in retreat must be obvious as also are the dimculties of arranging such opportunities

Surely the enemy if they knew would oblige with little extra pressure which might produce the desired retreat

OUR BOOKINGOFFICE
By Mr Punchs Staff of Learned Clerks
take it that Mr Maurice Hewlett designed his new Dovel The Little Iliad Heinemann frankly as grotesque an opinion in which four exceedingly quaint illustrations by Sir Philip BurneJones distinctly confirm me
The story is in quito an original vein the interest and mystery very adroitly sustained
We are given gruesome picture of physically wrecked but still indomitable sensualist de plorably dragging shuffling feet Baron von Broderodc married to very beautiful and gracious woman who had been caught young from out convent
Enter Sector MaUeson an egregious sentimentalist heir incidentally of Highland chieftain
He diagnoses an Andromeda dragon situation thought which apparently had not occurred to the Baroness who however cordially accepts the suggestion and is made profoundly miserable
Eventually she flies and finds asylum at the headquarters of the Malleson clan where three other sons of the house as also the old chieftain himself fall hopelessly in love with her
Comes the relent less Baron in pursuit and how this modern Menelaus first wins then loses the game and where the fair Helena finally bestows her widowed hand must leave Mr Hewletts diverting little Iliad to inform you
can promise you good entertainment and though as have hinted the thing is planned in freakish mood the author has not let himself off the honest labour of construction and polish
His sympathies are throughout with his wicked Baron who is very new version of the strong silent hero and may fairly be considered sport
What refuse to believe about him is that even though he shot from pony cart he got his gun up like lightning and fired at the instant consider ing the painful struggles he bad to get his wineglass or cigar accurately to his mouth pathological details that Mr Hewlett has been at pains to rub well in
Something will really have to be done about it
If many more of our novelists take to turning out these prodigiously long stories we reviewers will have to agitate for payment by piecework
The latest exponent of the gentle art of garrulity is Mr Temple Thurston with his new novel The Achievement of Bichard Furlong Chapman and Hall
There are seven hundred and twentyeight pages of it so that when you have turned the last of them you may perhaps feel that the achievement is not exclusively con fined to the hero
Bichard Furlong was painter and etcher and the object of Mr Thurston is to trace his progress from obscurity to fame but though he is repre sented as doing lot of artistic work in bis spare time it would be more fair to say that the real successes of Bichard were gained in the domain of what might call wishing to put the matter as delicately as possible unceremonious polygamy
Erom the moment when he runs away from the paternal mill and joins the company of Mr Thurstons other heroes in picturesque slumexistence round about Drury Lane his career becomes sentimental journey from one affair to another
dont want to say that there are PUNCH OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
September not pleasant passages in the book there is always certain jollity in tale of success bub do think that justice could have been done to the theme in smaller compass
In his preface Mr Thurston tells how he came to abandon his intontion of publishing three separate books about Richard Furlongs history and to bind them instead into one volume
My only comment on this is that it remains true that three of his furlongs make at least mile
During the last twenty years Sir Gilbert Parker has written dozen novels
At such stage fancy is accus tomed to flag and kind hearted friends are apt to regret that the author has written himself out
This makes more pleasant the discovery that in The Money Master Hutch inson Sir Gilbert surpasses himself
The story opens with the introduction of Jean Jacques Barbille miller and money master commonplace man inclined to vanity buzzing with consciousness of worldly prosperity built up by himself
On voyage homeward bound from Europe where he was disappointed hen he entered Notre Dame or great building like the Law Courts at Eouen that people didnt whisper to each other Here comes Jean Jacques Barbille he made the acquaint ance of Spanish beauty slim and longlimbed Diana
He married her or to be precise it was she who married him for comfortable home and relief from penury shared with scamp of father
The Reader student of human nature with mature know ledge of its frailties knows at once what will happen
The beautiful sensuous Carmen bored with the dulness of daily life in company with Jean Jacques early succumb ing will go off with another man
The Reader is right
What he does not yet know but should take the earliest opportunity of learning is with what masterful skill with what touches of pathos the dull man miller and general dealer his dross purified in the fire of adversity is slowly step by step transformed into hero of sublime unselfish ness
Nearly every page of the story certainly every chapter reveals the inventive resources of the author
These never fail and the reader is with growing interest hurried on to the unexpected denouement
The world of Jean Jacques village which the censor may permit refer ence to as somewhere in the neighbourhood of Quebec is peopled with diversity of characters whose acquaint ance and environment are refreshing after long course of ordinary novels
grievance that the American has against Englishmen is that they pay visits to his country and then try to put it all into single book
He holds that America is too large thing to be put into single book
Yet in Turmoil odder and Stoughton Booth Tarkington has come very near succeeding in this feat
Turmoil for all that it has only three hundred and twelve pages covers the whole oE one side and that the most characteristic side of American life
It puts into words better than anyone has ever done before the American ideal of Bigness its obvious faults and its less obvious merits
We must be Bigger
Get people here
Coax them here
Swindle them into coming
Deafen them into coming
Any kind of people
We must be Bigger
We want Bigness
That was the motto of the tow in which Bibbs Sheridan lived and it was the motto of James Sheridan his father and Bibbs by nature poet and dreamer of dreams found himself forced by circumstances to kill his dreams and plunge in and blow and boost and brag with the rest until at length there came to hearten him the realization that hidden beneath all the boosting and bigness there was certain something that was also poetry of kind
In the United States Turmoil has had vogue that recalls the days of the old bestsellers those strange pro ductions which it resembles only in its popularity
It is easily the best novel that Mr Tarkington has written
Thero are flashes of the humour that illumined his Penrod stories but for the most part the author is grimly in earnest as befits his theme
It is story to be read by all who would un derstand the soul of the country that has produced skyscrapers and Pittsburg and the Chicago slaughterhouses
Man alive
this is Gods country and blind man couldnt help seein it
You certainly stand up for your own town if you stick to sayin you rather live there than you would here
You sure are some patriot to say that after you ve seen our city
show you something now thatll make your eyes stick out
Thus Mr James Sheridan to European visitor and that is America in nutshell

There is real stuff as opposed to stuffing in Miss Will cocks Change Hutchinson
In truth her material is better than her pattern which is rather casual and formless
She loaves loose threads abandons even promising beginnings certainly crowds her embroidery frame with too many figures
But you read her story and comment without skipping get pleasure of her characters who really seem to be alive and doing and answer for it you be willing to put up with little defects of form for sake of such fine substance as the patient and indirect wooing of little brown Bess Latimer the orphan by the Professor charming piece of delicate romance
There is background of Starrs folk whose blood was older and bluer than their purses were long and who were little too conscious of other peoples essential inferiority
It is part of the defect of Miss Willcocks method that one cant make out just what the chango was which one supposes from her title to be the motive of her work
She gives me the impression of not having quite found herself even yet
But she will and meanwhile she has the heart of the matter in her

THE VALUE OF CONCENTRATION SUCCESS in career an en terprise or struggle depends almost entirely upon concen tration
Its the old story of the bundle of sticks
Effort concen trated produces better total results than the same amount of effort distributed
Concentrate but concentrate at the point of effect
He would be poor general who massed his best troops where his position was naturally least vulnerable or where strong offensive would have no strategical or tactical value
It is the same with advertising
The right goods are of no use to the wrong people and the wrong people are of no use to the adver tiser
Waste of time telling man the advantages of what he cannot pay for or is incapable of appreciating not to say waste of money
Look at it this way
Only people above definite income line have the means to buy your goods or only those with defi nite standard of taste are likely to appreciate them

Clearly to advertise effectively through these media means much useless publicity paid for on circulation rates
Suppose however that not group but single journal covers the whole of the profitable class and practically that class alone
