Living dead men
Emaci ated mortals without soul raised from graves by satanic power and driven to toil by the will of merciless tyrant for greed and power
Hokum says science
Death will not sell its heritage even to the devil
Drugs sus pended animation hypnotism of such things are Zombies
But have you ever seen Zombie
Many men have
Such men do not scoff they run for they sense the ungodliness of Zombie eyes the atmosphere of hell that permeates the presence of these things be yond the grave who neither talk nor eat nor bleed when torn apart
Corpses of Corruption Haiti Inner China eyewitness accounts by those who do not want to talk afraid of the demonic power which might reach out to fasten uncanny fangs on those who tell too much
Even starving rats and wolves of China shrink from these corpses of corruption nor will the snakes of Haiti strike at these walking things which defy poison
United States Marine lost in the swamp given up for dead by his comrades forced to seek refuge with natives preparing for Black Magic
He would have become human sacrifice to the Zombie god had he not at one time saved the life of wounded native
And now this native pleads for the white marine and he is allowed to see but never tell under penalty of what he knows would be worse than torture
But he has now spoken to one he can trust
The Zombie god will understand because this one in whom he has confided does not scoff nor seek to punish by man made laws
Unholy Discord The night is dark the wet mist of an eerie fog rises like the breath of hell from the stinking swamp where reptiles crawl and wait to devour insects which venture into the night
Tom toms accompany weird incantation of unholy discord as tiny lights appear on surrounding hillocks
Then stronger light looms up in the depths of the swamp fire before crude altar ready for the kill
The smaller lights of single torches begin to move like fire flies slowly converging on the altar fire until they are dimmed by the greater light and then go out
The assembly is ready
The Master giant native clothed in filthy shroud steps forward and stands before the altar
The black skin of his fiendish face smeared with rancid oil and blood shines in the firelight and his eyes gleam like pools of phosphorus
The incantations grow louder broken only by mumblings of demonic ritual
The Sacrifice scream
The sacrifice
young virgin her body writhing like captured python as it is carried to the altar by two naked blacks each holding leg and an arm of the victim
The sight of the altar and the fire is too much for the terrified girl
She swoons
Voices stop but the torn toms pound with increased fury
The great moment has arrived
Gently the quivering body is laid upon the bloodstained altar
The Master steps forward knife flashes and the body is still
The torn toms stop as though in si lent respect for the departing soul of this child of sacrifice
No sounds save the crackling of the fire and the noise of in sects
The Master withdraws his knife and raises his hands above his head
Instantly voices mumble and the torn toms once more begin their dirge of death
Sinister Operation Down again comes the knife this time slowly
The incantations continue
Then with the precision of surgeon the Master cuts into the breast of the girl
Slowly carefully he removes the heart
He drops the knife and takes the bleeding heart in the hollow of both his hands and holds it before him
All but the Master drop upon their faces in supplication
None sees what the Master does with the heart for when the natives come to their feet again the heart has dis appeared
Somewhere in the folds of that filthy shroud rests the cherished organ of girl who might have found love
But the ceremony is not over although the swamp is now quiet
The body of the girl is quickly removed
Authorities must never find it

Marked Grave ZOMBIE
Another Zombie for the Master
For days prior to this festival of evil grave has been marked grave where rests the body of strong man who died in the prime of life
He must live again and this time work for the Master
The unholy procession soon arrives at the designated grave
By this time the moon has risen
The Master halts
No words are spoken
only queer move ments of fingers and lips
The Master steps back
The men come forward
Crude shovels appear
And soon the wooden box which houses the corpse pronounced dead by white mans doctor is opened
Death looks up into the moonlight
It matters not if rigor mortis has stiffened the body or if putrefaction has brought stench beyond white mans endurance the corpse is lifted by strong arms and stood up on its feet in front of the Master
The Master then grasps the hand of the corpse and holds the body upright before him
Then the followers fall prostrate and watch no more
Only the Master speaks but his words are whisper
His other hand passes over the head and face of the man perhaps buried for weeks
There is sickening gurgle stronger than the rattle of death
And this sound comes not from the Master but from the thing before him
Zombie Is Born The Master still holds the hand of the corpse but not for long
The dead man is standing alone
His eyes open but in those eyes are no longer look of human intelligence
but vacant stare of soulless creature without consciousness or the breath of God
Another Zombie is born
compact with hell Deaths bargain for the virgin sacrificed to the devil
Who knows
dont believe it says the skeptic
It might have looked true but the man wasnt dead
He had been drugged by the socalled Master perhaps some strange drug known only to the witchdoctors of Haiti
This drug might have the power to suspend animation stop the heart and lungs sufficient to fool any doctor
Maybe the drug would soften the brain
And then when the Master dug him up days later another drug was administered and the man came back to life his mind blank
An imbecile not Zombie

mm Send this coupou ii address shown above Continued from page John who was employed by French planter
Says the Frenchman saw John die of pneumonia
He was pronounced dead by the doctor and before we could bury him rigor mortis had set in and his body turned green
saw him buried
Three weeks later my son said he saw John working in field back in the hills but John seemed deaf and dumb
In order to quiet my son investigated
The man looked like John even to the scar on his cheek and the pock mark on his nose
But John didnt know me
He seemed to look right through me with the expression of an imbecile
No it couldnt be John
John was in his grave
Of course it was possible for two men to look alike even to similar scars but this man didnt have Johns expression
dismissed the thought but my son was not convinced
He had heard too much about Zombies
So secured permission to open Johns grave
We dug
The grave was empty
But someone must have learned about my secret investigation for when we went to claim Johns body he was missing
The native owner knew nothing about him
He said we must have been dreaming or see ing ghost
And the skeptic replies Of course they were dreaming
Perhaps the grave was robbed by body snatchers who sold it to medical students for dissecting purposes
Strange Experience But how about the Japanese corporal who confidentially revealed his strange ex perience in Northern China to an English friend within the past year
Here is the story For many miles northwest of Peiping Japanese regiment had advanced finally nearing the objective not far from Mon golia
But before they could reach this point they had to pass through small mountain village situated in tiny valley
The road was narrow bounded by two hills which commanded the road
On the cliff like sides of these two hills were huge rocks ideal for machinegun nests which could mow down any soldiers entering the village
There were several of these nests and many Japanese soldiers had been killed
Finally the Japanese commander brought up his artillery and gave orders to blow those machinegun nests to bits
They were demobilized
Any Chinese gunners in them were buried under pile of rocks and debris
All but one
Heavy shells could not stop this gun which kept firing whenever any Japanese soldiers came into view
Something had to be done to silence that gun
Finally Japanese corporal with one man was ordered to climb the rear of the hill and try to sneak down on the Chinese gunner and destroy him
The whole regiment waited
An hour passed
Then the corporal and his man were seen crawling on their bellies down from the top of the hill
They had to be careful
The slope was steep
It was an intense moment
If the Chinese gunner saw them he would be able to swing his gun around and exter minate them with ease
But the gun kept shooting at the road below whenever Japanese soldier ap peared in the open
The Japanese pur posely coaxed the fire so the gunner would not notice the men creeping down behind him
Tense Moments It was not until the corporal was fifty feet away that he could barely see the Chinese gunner protected under heavy arch of rocks sitting at his gun which pointed through small opening
The corporal was afraid to hurl hand grenade for fear that the explosion might loosen the dirt beneath his own body and he and his man would slide to death
And it would be difficult to throw grenade in the small archway
Furthermore the gunner was so protected that even pistol shot would have to be too accurate
There wasnt enough of the body exposed to view
No the only way was to knife him or shoot him at close range
Suddenly as the corporal crawled closer small rock under him gave way
It rolled down the slope and bounced on the archway
The Japanese corporals heart almost stopped from fear
If the gunner heard it and looked around it would be sure death for the Japanese
But the gunner didnt budge
He seemed to be glued to the spot his eyes on the opening in front of him
Forty feet
thirty feet
They were upon him
Now to rush him
The corporal drew his gun and the private grabbed his trench knife in readiness
Both men jumped at the same time and inches away the corporal shot the Chinese in the back while the private plunged knife into the filthy neck
The gunner seemed to slump over his gun from the force of impact and the two Japanese satisfied they had killed him jumped to the top of the archway and shouted to their comrades
cry of victory went up from the troops below as they ran into the road in answer to the brave corporal
But something was wrong
The gun sup posed to be silenced began firing again and several Japanese soldiers dropped in the road below
The corporal infuriated dropped behind the archway and this time hurled hand grenade tearing head and arms from the Chinese gunner

torn APRIL Death Has Five Guesses What Frightening Force in Clintons Brain Wove the Scarlet Pattern of His Mysterious Fate
By ROBERT BLOCH Author of The Curse of the House Feast in the Abbey etc
THE real horror lay in the fact that Harry Clinton was just an ordinary college boy
He sported disreputable suede jacket the left underarm wellworn from the rubbing of the textbooks he carried
He was given to whistling popular song hits and he owned most of the latest swing phono graph recordings
He drove non descript car and worried about the price of gasoline
He played basket ball on the second team he liked ketchup on his hamburgers he oh well he was an ordinary college boy just one of thousands
And yet he knew grinning Fear
Harry Clinton had gone to West ern Tech for two years when Pro fessor Bairn began his experiments
Like the other students in Psychol ogy Clinton participated in the initial trials
It was just routine matter nothing more
Professor Bairn was interested in the Rhine Experiments the Duke University studies in extrasensory perception
He summarized his in tentions to the Psych
class briefly at the outset
The Rhine Experiments were an effort to determine the laws of Chance and their relation to human guesses
Youve heard of hunches and in tuition and telepathy Bairn told his STRANGE STORIES class the first day
Well heres your chance to find out what its all about
have here pack of twenty five playingcards
They are special cards five suits of five each
There are five stars five circles five squares five sets of wavy lines and five crosses
They are single black line figures on white background and these five were more or less chosen for their simplicity and their sym bolic association with ordinary con scious and subconscious images
Is that clear enough
Five sets of cards square circle cross star wavy lines
Ill pass these sets out and allow you to examine them
He did so and Harry Clinton looked at the little cards with the rest
Professor Bairn continued The basic idea in using these cards is simple
The operator holds one of them up to the subject with only the back visible
The subject closes his eyes allows his mind to become blank
Then he calls out the name of the first of the five sym bols to cross his consciousness
He may actually seem to see square or circle or star as the case may be
Perhaps the operator and the subject are seated back to back so that there is no possibility of facial expression or eye reflection on the part of the operator informing the subject or giving him hint
THE class exhibited tepid interest Clinton included
According to the experiments the score of correct guesses in most cases is five
This seems natural enough because if you were to go through the deck of twentyfive and call out star each time youd have to be right five times since there are five cards in each of the five suits
But and this is very large but in the course of these experiments it was discovered that some students were able to guess perhaps ten or twelve cards correctly
Upon repeat ing the tests over period of days many achieved scores of fifteen or even twenty
Certain people seemed peculiarly apt guessers
While the scores of others varied from high to low there were some who persist ently turned in the same or nearly the same high score
This has led to the setting upof theory of extrasensory perception an unknown quantity which may or may not account for certain peo ple having the knacks in making hunches or foreseeing the future or even for receiving telepathic com munications
Harry Clinton was thinking about betting on football games
Certain students submitted to months of testing
It was discovered then that odd effects on their scor ing ability could be brought about by getting them drunk or by testing them when they were fatigued or excited or stimulated
Some of them scored higher when told they were making progress others dropped woefully
It was ascertained that guessing ability has nothing to do apparently with the actual intelligence of per son
But and this is important the variance of reaction under differen tiated forms of stimuli implied that there was definite power affected Rhine has chosen to call this power the power of extrasensory percep tion
believe that Professor Rhine has shown the way to opening up new frontiers of the human mind
And with your permission should like to call upon few volunteers today
Clinton was one of the five chosen
He watched three others sit blind folded in chair while Professor Bairn held up the cards one by one and waited for them to call out symbol
He sorted the cards into piles of correct and incorrect guesses
Clinton noticed that the first sub ject girl guessed very swiftly
The second hesitated often
The third went quite fast for space slowed down and regained speed to ward the end
Clinton sat in the chair placed the warm blindfold over his eyes and began guessing
Square circle circle star square curly line star cross cross curly line cross no thats square now cross circle DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES He felt queer
It was hardly his own voice droning
It was hardly his brain that saw in the darkness the rapid flickering images of circles and squares and stars and curly lines and crosses
Something directed him made him speak
He completed the test in fortytwo seconds
BAIM said nothing
He discoursed on individual peculiarities men tioned how some guessers were fast others slow others erratic
He also intimated that memory that is the knowledge that one had already called star five times and conse quently would not call it again dur ing the same testing might subcon sciously influence the guessing
real definitive score he said can be obtained only after seven consecutive tests
Ah Mr Clinton would you care to go through the pack again six times for the benefit of the class
Clinton agreed sat down in the chair again
The images came swiftly
The period bell rang as the tests were concluded and the students trooped out
Bairns bulky figure leaned close as Clinton rcse and removed his ban dages
Mr Clinton Id like to have word with you
Yes Professor
Mr Clinton should very much appreciate your working with me this semester on these tests
Your initial scores might say are ah remarkably high
This might be fluke an accident but any extraor dinary ability should be cultivated
Of course this will be credited to your regular work you know
Why sure
Why not
Say what is my average anyway
Twentythree Mr Clinton
An amazing twentythree
Clinton worked with Professor Bairn for months
The experiments broadened in their technique
New methods were employed
One night Baim called Clinton on the phone and requested him to guess the cards over the wire
They worked in sep arate rooms for several days worked with screens between them worked in total darkness conducted the tests with telegraph keys and called the guesses in French and German
It made no difference Clinton showed his remarkable aptitude throughout
At first for Clinton it was lark
Then it became problem to wonder over
After time it reached the stage of competition battle of wits against the Unknown
And finally during the third month it was drudgery
Baim was writing monograph on his work with Clinton
Although the professor endeavored to repress his enthusiasm Clinton knew that he was highly pleased with the venture
The extraclassroom nature of the studies kept Clinton very busy
Bairns demands on his time and his insistence on undertaking tests at odd hours and under odder circum stances began after while to annoy him
There were days when Clinton went through the deck thirty times running
He grew sick of the sym bols exasperated
Even the surpris ingly high percentage of totally cor rect scores no longer seemed worthy goal to him
Despite all the work he understood no more of his unusual power or ability than he had at the beginning
He merely closed his eyes and the pictures came the five symbols loomed up almost au tomatically
He tried guessing ordinary play ing cards and failed miserably
He lost two dollars on the home team in football game
He had no luck in guessing examination questions
Undoubtedly this peculiar sixth sense was uncontrollable
By the conclusion of the third month it was worse than that
He left his daily tests with headaches
He began to experience periods of moody irritability
Moreover he had tendency to forget trifles and de tails
sort of mild amnesia seemed to steal over him at times so that he was unable to account for his actions for halfhours at time
Usually after his testing periods he would have difficulty in concen STRANGE STORIES trating on anything else for quite while
The symbols stuck with him and closing his eyes he would invol untarily conjure up images of crosses and stars and curly lines and squares and circles
They floated in his head and when he opened his eyes again an hour had passed some how
This got worse
Clinton told no one for he himself did not quite know what was the matter
But in the middle of May he suddenly ex perienced an attack of amnesia which lasted for three days
IT WAS so hard to think
Harry Clinton that was his name had gone into room and now his hands were around some thing soft
He had done many things in the past three days and somehow he couldnt think just what they were
Or rather part of him didnt want to remember what they were
They had been bad things
Was he at home in the rooming house in his own bed
Was this all nightmare
No it was real
He was standing with his hands around something soft and three days had passed
Three days of school of study of work
Why couldnt he remember them
It was even hard to see
He felt as though his eyes were closed as though he was taking the tests guessing at the brightlycolored mental pictures of crosses stars curly lines squares and circles
That was why he couldnt remem ber
It had something to do with the tests and the way they had af fected him lately
He must think back now
For week or so he had been taking forty turns through the deck day
Pro fessor Baim had asked him to as final experiment to be written up for his almost completed monograph
Each days testing had left him with terrific headache
More than that he had been un able lately to shake off the recur ring visions of the five symbols
He would leave the college and one or more of the symbols would come and stay in his brain
He would fall asleep thinking of the cross and awake with the same thought static in his mind
That had caused his memory lapse
But where was he now
He stared down again at his hands and gasped as mists cleared
He Harry Clinton remembered
He remembered that first evening when he had thought he was going to be sick and had stepped into the alley
He had leaned over the refuse box as consciousness dissolved into swirling mist
But now he could recall what happened
He had leaned over the refuse box had gazed into it and seen what lay at the bottom
Two broken sticks lay there probably torn from some packingcrate
They lay there one atop the other and they had formed cross
Clinton had picked them up that is his hands had done so
Clinton himself did not exist
There were only hands and something guiding them which was not Clinton or Clintons brain some alien force that felt drawn to the symbol of the cross
The hands picked up the sticks fumbled about in the trash box for length of wire bound the sticks into permanent crucifix shape
Then Clintons body had walked down the narrow alley and Clintons eyes had kept looking at the base of the cross where the stick was broken and ended in jagged point
Clintons eyes had gloated
But Clinton himself had hated what he was doing because he did not understand and hated the other part of consciousness which drove him to fashion symbol he wished to forget so that as he walked he grew very angry
Every time he closed his eyes the cross was there in his forehead
It was burning up there just the way it did when Clinton guessed the cards at school
Only there were no cards this time and still the cross remained
The memory was haunt ing him making him do absurd DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES things like fashioning this wooden crucifix with the pointed end
If only Clinton could forget the cross
He closed his eyes quite tightly lurching down the alley wishing that the two crossed iron bars against his brain would go away
He must not see the cross Clinton opened his eyes and saw the man coming down the alley from the opposite direction
It was dark but the moon was up and he saw that the man wore black skirts
For moment he feared he was delirious and then he realized the truth
It was priest
Coming near he saw the moonlight pick out glittering pattern on the priests chest
glit tering pattern of cross
The golden cross dangled it swayed from side to side as the priest walked
The moon was cruelly bright so that its rays made of the crucifix blinding blur
Clinton looked and could not tear his eyes away
But he wanted to he wanted to with all his soul
He did not want to do what he And then Clinton stepped over to the priest just as he passed and from behind his back he drew the wooden crucifix with the pointed end and drove the point straight into the priests chest
He walked away his empty hands clutching at the air with sort of joy born of the fact that they were empty they no longer held the cross
There was joy in his mind too for it was empty of the symbol which when normal he so deeply respected but which in his dream like state of abnormality obsessed him
No cross now only that tin gling emptiness his whole brain was empty and free
Harry Clinton went home and slept slept gratefully without dreams
For he was empty and when he awoke he had forgotten the night before with the cross and the priest
In the class the next day when the cards were called Clinton scored only seven
Two squares had come two circles one curly line and two stars
But no cross
Never during the entire test had he called out cross or thought of one
There were times when his eyes closed he had almost consciously tried to conjure up the vision of the cross in his mind
He had failed
He knew that there were five cross marks in the pack of twentyfive and yet in honesty he could not call aloud an image that he did not see
This Clinton now remembered
HE remembered the following day the day he guessed the five stars correctly
It was the day of the astronomy lecture too
Had that affected him
He wondered
He had called the five stars cor rectly
After leaving class the head ache had come

and EX LAX THE ORIGINAL CHOCOLATED LAXATIVE At all druggists STRANGE STORIES He walked through the cool streets of dusk his feet moving automati cally along unbidden paths
Thoughts refused to come
He stopped in at drug store and bought some as pirin then meandered along the streets again
He had not wanted to go to his room
He caught himself straining to hear the sound of cars passing the conversation of others in the street
For some reason he was particularly anxious to be amidst noise and lights and people any thing that might arrest his attention and ease the ache in his temples the ache that was all dull nothing ness in which bright star blazed
Erratic footsteps followed his gre garious urge until he was moving along downtown
The welcome clangor of streetcars began to fade and only constant blinking enabled him to keep his eyes open
Abnor mal nictation seemed the sole salva tion at the moment when now even sounds failed to hold his attention
GRATEFULLY he had entered the vaudeville theater sunk into loge seat and willed himself to watch the final reels of the motion picture flashing across the screen
At the conclusion he experienced nasty shock when the trademark of the producing company flickered into view with its crest of five stars
The theater was nearly deserted at sup perhour and in the darkness Harry Clinton fought losing battle with the fivepointed image that thrust itself again and again between his inner eyes and his outer vision of the screen
The brassy orchestra heralded the stage show and for few minutes Clinton again knew peace
But the star act Clinton had winced when the master of ceremo nies announced the turn as such was the personal appearance of movie queen
The whole thing was madness
Movie star she swept onto the stage against background of glittering silverfoil star
Garishly lighted the five silver points gleamed painfully and Clinton could not move his eyes away
The image mocked him and the blonde girl before it undulating about the stage in sequins seemed part of the star itself
Clinton bit his hand to keep from screaming
His mind groped for thought any thought to hold his attention to swerve it from the thought which en gulfed him
And in the darkness he lost
He rose to his feet and started down the aisle before the act was over
No longer was he conscious aware of thought or action
He passed the boxes and entered the passageway which led backstage
Some part of him was moving slowly cautiously
All he saw was great glittering star star which was em blazoned on his mind and which ob truded between any other image and reality
He must get rid of the star in his mind
Cautiously he moved along the de serted backstage corridor
The act was over the hallway momentarily deserted
He walked slowly down toward the door under the light paused before it
There was gold star on the door of the dressingroom
Its five points were sawteeth biting into his brain
He stared at it then pushed the door open
The blond girl was sitting at her dressingtable eating
Clinton did not see her
He saw star
There was heavy bluntended mirror on the table
There was large sturdy walkingstick in the corner
Clinton did not see them
He saw stageproperty artificial mace in wallstand
Its head was studded with fivepoints
Clinton ignored the other weapons
Walking slowly he seized the mace as the door closed behind him
The girl turned around
Clinton saw the star burn brighter
She rose said something
Clinton saw the star move closer
It was close enough to reach now
Some part of him held the mace
And then dream fused with reality as he brought the mace down
One two three four five times each time point fell away from the core of torment in his brain
Then there was only blur DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES that became red red as the pool on the floor where something lay
Clinton turned opened the door walked out back through the passage and resumed his seat in the theater
He must have fallen asleep for when he awoke the last show was over and the houselights were going up
He did not remember how he had come to this place or what he had done here
And he did not think about stars
The next day in class he had re fused to take the test telling Pro fessor Bairn that he was indisposed
At the time he did not know any reason for doing so except that he felt vaguely tired and incapable of effort
He asked to be excused early and went home
He did not even read the papers had he done so he might have seen the accounts of the mys terious death of Father Pornelski who had been murdered by an un known religious fanatic two days before
He could have read of second murder which was already making national headlines the strange death of wellknown mo tion picture actress
HARRY CLINTON was oblivious to all he only knew that he felt tired and quite unaccountably he did not wish to continue with the extrasensory perception experiments
They had given him these recent headaches and peculiar lapses of memory he felt sure
Today he was glad that his mind was free
Once in his room he lay back in the win dowless gray and almost revelled in the blankness of his brain
Funny since taking up these psych experiments hed thought hell of lot about his own mind
Before that he had never even known he had one
Oh well
It was pleas ant and soothing here
Closing his eyes he watched the two dancing lines of parallel curlicues two gray curly lines wriggling before his naked brain
Two curly lines
What did they remind him of
Of course Sally
Sallys curly hair
He sure was forgetful these days why he hadnt seen Sally for over week
Mrs Johnson the land lady had left note under his door three days ago saying that Sally had called the night he was out some where walking off his headache
The poor kid she was worrying about him
Why had he neglected her that way
OW that he thought of it thought of gray lines he could not stop
This psych stuff was sure de veloping his concentration all right
It seemed as though he just had to go and see Sally
She would be home now Thursday afternoon
Her biology lab
period was over at eleven on Thursdays
He must drop in and surprise her
He had to sur prise Sally
Sally with the curly yellow hair
Two curls in back
Long golden curls
Oldfashioned girl
He was already walking down the street turning up
light misty rain was falling and glancing into the street Clinton noticed the tread markings caused by the tires of skidding car
They left two curly lines
He was going to see Sally
One block more
The curly lines
They got mixed up with his thoughts of Sally
Two golden caterpillars on her neck
On her white neck
Two curly lines
Ring the bell
No one in
Open the door her room is in front
Curly fringes on the carpet be neath his feet
Curly fingers knock ing on the door
Curly lines of two red lips to kiss
Oh Harry where have you been
Ive worried so Curls
On her neck
Think about Sally not the curls
What are you staring at
You look funny
Must feel the curls
Dont want to but must
Cant think until they are felt
Cant think at all
It was only after touching the curls that Harry Clinton did begin to think
It was then that he re membered everything the death of the priest and the star and the ob sessive mingling of Sally and the STRANGE STORIES curly lines
Clinton thought of all these things because he had been shocked into doing so shocked by gazing down at his own hands clutch ing Sallys curls
Sallys curls which his hands had wound about her neck and tightly pressed to strangle her to death
Clinton knew then
Even as he ran through the streets he knew
He could think only too clearly now
He was in the grip of some obsession concerning the five symbols on the extrasensory perception cards
The strain of guessing those symbols with closed eyes day after day for months in variety of experiments his facility in conjuring up the proper mental images these things had induced some abnormal condi tion whereby one or more of the symbols now came to his mind with out conscious effort to recall any
It was sheer habit to think of star cross curly line square or circle
Telepathy what was it
What peculiar force in the brain aided him in his guessing
Was it psychic power or an alien intelligence prompting him
Whatever the cause the matter had passed all controllable bounds
He was helpless to fend off the power of the symbols for symbols they had become
When preyed upon by the recur ring image of the cross he had en countered the priest and some part of his brain had identified the holy man with the cause of his torment
He had killed the priest to erase from his mind the cross symbol
And had not instinct guided him to choose symbolic weapon
In the vaudeville theater he had seen the star
Out of several weap ons in her dressingroom he was prompted by the symbolism of the macehead
Was he actually guilty of such crimes
Or was he dual person ality
Some subconscious murdering impulse had guided him very cun ningly in the execution of his kill ings
Was he insane
He must have been to kill Sally
Good God he had killed her
That was why he was running
No one had seen him
Her curly hair two curly lines on her neck writhing through his brain he was forced to erase the crawling curly lines from memorj
Symbolically he did so with her death
That was another thing
He had not taken the test
Merely thinking of Sally this last time had caused identification
And there was still the circle and the square to go
Would he murder two images of transference because of them
He panted with exhaustion lying on the bed in his room
Would he murder two more
What could he do to prevent it
HAD to drop psych
That was cer tain
And keep from anything which might even vaguely be asso ciated with the last two symbols
He could not he fancied play poker any more with the three boys down the hall
They sat at square table and there were four of them
It might suggest the square
Or the chips might suggest the circle
fat man could evoke the circle image
Or even the phrase square shooter applied to some man was liable to set him off
Yet he needed squareshooter
He had to tell someone about this
That was the way they did it in psychiatry wasnt it
The old idea of the confessional
Whom could he trust
Whom could he tell
He would state the case hypothetically of course and get the dope straight
But whom
Professor Bairn
Yes Bairn was the logical man
He knew about all this
Clinton would have to see him to drop the class anyway
And per haps Bairn knew of way out
There had to be way out at once
Murders could not continue
He was going crazy
It was all insane and at any minute the torturing images might recur to blot out all thought and sanity
Why not go now
Clinton rose and walked swiftly out of the room out of the house down the street to the Campus Square
DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES It was four oclock
He had murdered Sally at two thirty
It was an absurd thought
An hour and half ago he had mur dered woman
Now he was going to what was he going to do
Oh yes see Bairn
Good old Bairn
He would know way to help
His classes were over hed be working in his office
The wide office door loomed before him
It was very wide
Almost square
Clinton walked in
Bairn was sit ting at the desk his square shoul ders hunched over Oh no
Mustnt think of squares
Hello Professor
Dont think about the square jaw
wanted to talk to you
Think of something else quick
Whats he doing
Oh yes he has the cards out on the desk
Why the cards are square
Your cards are square Profes sor
HAT was he saying
The cards are square
Professor Bairns cards are square
Professor Bairn taught me to think of squares
Pro fessor Bairn will play square with me
Professor Bairn is square
Whats the matter
Dont be afraid Professor
Professor Square no Bairn hes afraid
Hes backing away
What do look like
What am doing
Hes backing up to the window
The window think of the window for Gods sake think of anything but Professor Bairn is square
Think of the window
The window is square
Bairn is backed against the open square window
Square against square
Square accounts
Professor Hes falling
Twisting around
Twisting why he isnt square any more
Hes all crumpled
That was easy
Its gone
Now to get rid of that damned circle
Clinton was almost happy as he slipped out the side entrance
He walked slowly back to the room inghouse even listened to the news boy on the corner of Hale and Jef ferson shouting about the Extra
Reedalla bouta moider
Collichgoil foundead
He didnt buy paper
He knew all about the murder
He knew all about lots of murders
But what worried him was that he didnt know about the next murder
There had to be one
There sim ply had to be one
He must get rid of the circle
Then hed be all right again
Somehow he realized that these things were not right but it was all necessary
man couldnt live when his brain was on fire with incomprehensible images
This pe culiar power of his this psychic power of guessing correctly it was somehow alien and evil
Poor old Bairn had he actually realized the full extent of the forces he had tampered with
There was certainly lot to it he hadnt sus pected
Must have had his suspicions though when he went out the win dow
Perhaps he knew now
This stuff was all from across the Border
Clinton didnt know and couldnt control it
Funny idea
Suppose this was really some extra sensory perception of his this guessing faculty hed developed
Suppose it were and that it was not meant for men
Something or some one might guard it
Or per haps this faculty merely opened up new part of the mind in such way that the old mind was unable to govern or control the actions of its augmented self
There was dark stuff here and Clinton didnt want to tamper with it
Do the murder get rid of the last image forget about it all erase the circle and be free
Whom to sacriSce
The moonfaced husband of Mrs Johnson the landlady
Rogers the kid with the shaved head and the round skull
The circle is the symbol of in finity eternity
All life is circle
Curved space
Curved existence
Round and black
Up the stairs around to the room
STRANGE STORIES Think deliberately of the circle so that it may provide key to the way out
Release the brain
This would be planned deliber ate murder
Why not
There was gun in the drawer
Clinton took out the gun filled it with round cartridges gazed down the round hole in the muzzle
He was trying hard to think of the person he meant to kill and strangely no thought came although by this time he could see the circle quite plainly in his mind and for the first time he actually rejoiced in the pain
The blazing circle coruscated swirling round and round and round as he looked down the dark round muzzle of the gun
It was then that he heard the sounds from below and the tramp of footsteps on the stairs
Sluggishly he realized the truth
They were coming for him
After all four murders he was in daze must have left many clues
They were coming for him now
But they couldnt come
They couldnt lock him up now
Not now when the circle was squeezing tightly around his brain
He must get rid of the circle first find peace
Be cause they would shut him away for the rest of his life in madhouse and he couldnt stand it there with nothing but the thought of the cir cle
They were coming up the stairs
Clinton rose and stepped forward wildly gun in hand
The circle of his room
Something bright arrested his at tention
Something bright and round like the circle in his head
He tried to see it
He could see it
It was the mirror the silver cir cle of the mirror over his bureau
He stared into it
In the silver circle he saw himself his own round head
The knocking on the door came
But Clinton stared into the silver circle at his own round head
Clin ton stared into the dark circle of the gunmuzzle
He put the round muz zle to his round head and looked into the round mirror as though for confirmation
Yes it was right
Open in the name of the law
He had found the fifth symbol
It was the circle of life back to him self
He was the last symbol
Once he erased that he could find peace
Harry Clinton sent circular bul let into his circular brain
Whatever the source of his extra sensory perception he had guessed right at the end

All LL right here we are said Major Crosby halting
He glanced briefly at the four men who formed his body guard and then turned to young Henley
Now Henley he said dont want any interruption from you
Im going to handle this thing myself understand
You know how much influence these native witchdoctors have and its no go angering them needlessly
And Logodas bad one he and his filthy heads
Henley flushed beneath his bronze
One of those heads may be all thats left of my brother he said shortly
Logoda knows too much to bother an Englishman returned the major
My brotjier knew his magic
He knew too much of his magic said Henley staring through the bushes toward the squat hut of the witch doctor Logoda
Well for Gods sake dont start anything
The major started forward but Henley caught his arm
Wait Major he said
What is it
Crosby snapped
Talk to him in his own language said Henley
STRANGE STORIES havent mastered the native tongue yet returned the major crossly
didnt mean that said Henley significantly
Oh said the major startled for moment
Then he shook his head moodily and strode on across the clearing with Henley at his heels
few natives scattered warily as they came on leaving the door to Logodas hut clear
There was col lection of trophies about the en trance some of them were not pleas ant to look at
Major Crosby reflected briefly upon Englands inability to stamp out certain practises
Then he turned and curtly ordered his men to stay outside
Major Crosby lifted the matted doorway and went inside followed by Henley
It took them minute to get used to the darkness
Then they saw Logoda and the ugly stained heads dried and strung along on poles above the witchdoctors head
Major Crosby had been in the hut once before not so very long ago
There were ten heads then now there were eleven
The additional one in the light of Bob Henleys dis appearance made him uneasy
LOGODA an ungainly hulking man sat on his haunches in cor ner
He wore an odd headdress ap parently hastily put on at the inti mation of visitors but apart from this and few streaks of none too fresh paint he looked very little different from his fellow natives
Yet the man was very tangible and irritating power to the English sta tioned at the nearby post
Logoda white man is missing said the major coming directly to the point of his visit
He was known to have come in your direction
week ago seven days
Seven times the sun he came this way
Where is he
No white man said Logoda se renely
He moved the upper half of his body slightly forward so that his outflung arms came to rest on palms pressed flat against the ground
No white man he said again
Logoda Crosby replied sternly many men will come to search
They will burn your village they will put you in room with many bars
Surprisingly Henley interrupted
Youre wasting our time Major
told you to talk to him in his own language
Will you let me talk to him
No snapped the major angrily
Im convinced youre needlessly worried
Weve no actual proof that your brothers dead and theres Once again Henley interrupted him
Im going to look at those heads he said and before Crosby could stop him he stepped forward
Instantly Logoda pointed furiously at Henley and shouted You go way But Henley paid no attention
He stood under the dried heads gazing at them imperturbably mid Logodas furious mouthings and Major Cros bys nervous scrutiny
Suddenly Henley caught his breath and expelled it again with sharp hissing sound
he muttered
Major Crosby expostulated
Now look here Henley Logodas not had time to dry head
Only week hardly that
Henley looked at him
You are too new here Major Crosby he said
know how quickly they can dry them
There was something about Hen leys cold stare that stayed Crosbys angry words on his
Abruptly Logoda crossed his hands before his face bowed his head quickly to the ground and turned to ward the dried heads flinging out his arms as if in entreaty to them his palms turned upward toward them
From his mouth issued stream of weird gibberings
He is talking to the heads said Henley softly
Do not be surprised if they answer
You dont actually believe in this torn foolery Henley
demanded the major incredulously
Yes said Henley simply
Bob and have studied it long LOGODAS HEADS time
There is more in it than you think
Logodas gibbering quickly ceased
For moment there was complete si lence
The major was about to stalk out disgusted Then there sounded as if from far away shrill strange tittering it grew it mounted until it sounded all about them
and then it sub sided it subsided into subdued whispering which was lost grad ually lost in silence again
Above them Logodas heads were The majors skepticism was shaken and he was trying not to show it
Will you do me this favor Major
will not bother you again on my honor
want to talk to Logodas heads and do not want him to hear what say to them
The simplicity with which this re quest was uttered was in strange con trast to the wierdness of its content
The major swallowed with some difficulty and asked in thick voice Will you go after that
Yes Ill go then replied Henley
Coming in the NEXT ISSUE THE MAN WHO WAS DEATH Complete Novelet of Supernatural Powers By NORMAN DANIELS PLUS MANY OTHER GRIPPING TALES OF THE UNCANNY swaying back and forth though no one had touched them
Good God whispered the major
Major said Henley in strong voice will you take Logoda out of the hut for minute or two
want to be alone here
LOGODA sat smiling to himself his eyes hslfclosed rocking back and forth little like drowsy joss
But thought you promised stammered the major
Nothing will be disturbed promise you
Logoda will have no cause for complaint
But then why must he go out
Very well
The major stepped to the doorway and signalled to two of his men knowing they would be needed to move Logoda who would certainly not go of his own volition
Despite his furious protests Logoda was dragged to the doorway where he rose and walked so that his natives might not see this indignity being visited on him
Henley was left alone in the hut and his whispering voice drifted eeri ly to Major Crosby and his men who looked questioningly at each other
Henley was speaking in na tive tongue
STRANGE STORIES Only few minutes elapsed
Then Henley stepped from the hut his eyes glittering strangely and Lo goda after glaring at him in mur derous fury entered his home again
Im ready now Major said Hen ley Very well said the major in low voice
The five men made their long way back to the English post where they arrived just in time for suppsr
For long time Henley and the major did not speak to each other but over coffee at last Henley spoke
How much would you people give to be rid of Logoda
he asked softly
Major Crosby was startled but re solved not to show it
good deal think
But if youre planning to go back there to get him stop now
We could have potted him long time ago but for an Englishman to be seen anywhere around when witchdoctor dies suspiciously is cer tain to cause an insurrection and nasty one
Will you guarantee me passage to the coast
pursed Henley
told you it was impossible Hen ley
need all my men here any way
didnt mean protection meant money
have money waiting for me in Cairo but thats hellish long way off
want to get there and havent enough money
Oh said the major softening
had no idea
Well you dont have to earn it he went on smiling now
Im glad to be able to help you out
And get rid of me murmured Henley smiling too
But theres one more favor want to ask of you before leave
And that
asked the major ap prehensively
want you to tie me to my cot tonight and set guard over me said Henley grimly
What an extraordinary request exclaimed Major Crosby
Nevertheless an earnestly meant one
Will you Major
Well if you insist
And will you go then in the morning
feel very odd about this said the major some hours later as he sat beside the cot to which Henley had been tied
You neednt said Henley shortly
Im just protecting myself
Logo das afraid of me
He isnt afraid of you if youll forgive my saying it
He knows know too much
Bob did too and Bobs dried head now
have decided dont want to die and there are so many ways of bring ing about my death for man like Logoda
He could call me and would have to follow
Or he could come himself maybe little white dog or snake almost anything
Thats the why of all this you see
Really Henley
said the major somewhat stiffly youre talking like the most impossible madman
find it difficult to believe that youre the same man who has been so sane in my company the previous weeks
Yes understand that said Hen ley
know how you feel
am sorry to disturb the waters like that
Most of us like them smooth
But there are things like this and they do happen
Bob and have studied them too long to deny them
You dont have to believe them youd probably be better off without know ing anything about them
fWKHO made that laughter this ww afternoon and who made those heads sway like that
asked the major curiously and obviously against his will
told you Logoda spoke to them and they answered
Thats not telling me thing re plied the major
Perhaps not
Thats the only an swer though
Now forgive me Ive got long journey ahead of me and Ive got to get some sleep
In the morning Henley awoke to find the major bending over him un tying the ropes that bound him
Good morning Henley said
Hope you slept well
Thanks said the major smiling
Did anyone call for me in the LOGODAS HEADS night
asked Henley his voice grim
No one
watched for dogs and snakes and things and even consid ered potting couple of birds that got lost in the clearing
Good old major

asked the major then
am expecting message and as soon as it comes Ill be on my way
From whom
asked Major Crosby bluntly
That cant say
But you have scouts out havent you
Of course said Crosby shortly
Henley smiled
THEY were at breakfast when one of the majors scouts came dodg ing out into the clearing
He was ex cited and breathless from the exer tion of running
Theres my message think said Henley calmly
How about my passage money Major
The scout came up to them
Lo godas dead he said jerkily
Hes been killed
echoed the major
Good God
hope there werent any Eng lishmen around
Howd it happen
The natives say his magic killed him
Its queer business sir
His guards didnt see anyone enter the hut or anyone come out
They heard Logoda talking to his heads and they heard the heads answer
Then they heard him cough once or twice and finally he slept
That was all
This morning he was found in his hut with his throat torn out terribly mutilated cut and torn as if by thou sands of rats
Go back and find out whatever else you can ordered Major Crosby
The scout disappeared at once into the jungle
Crosby turned to Henley
You were on the bed all night Henley
And you guessed Logoda would be killed
Who did it
the question came angrily

Major Crosby flushed
Nonsense he snapped
Henley stood up smiling
Yet his voice was grim
told you it wasnt good to know about forbidden things
But Ill tell you
You heard Logoda and those heads and you will recall my insist ence on being left alone with them
Logoda knew how to make them talk and sway back and forth
knew how to make them rend and tear

inJi ed This is the tale they tell King that ere the royal banners were lifted upon the tall towers of Chaldean Ur before the Winged Pharaohs reigned in secret Aegyp tus there were mighty empires far to the east
There in that vast desert known as the Cradle of Mankind aye even in the heart of the measureless Gobi great wars were fought and high palaces thrust their minarets up to the purple Asian sky
But this King was long ago beyond the memory of the oldest sage the splendor of Imperial Gobi lives now only in the dreams of minstrels and poets
The Tale of Sakhmet the Damned
CHAPTER The Gates oi War IN THE gray light of the false dawn the prophet had climbed to the outer wall of Sardopolis his beard streaming in the chill wind
Before him stretching across the broad plain were the gay tents and pavilions of the besieging army em blazoned with the scarlet symbol of the wyvern the winged dragon be neath which King Cyaxares of the north waged his wars
Already soldiers were grouped about the catapults and scaling towers and knot of them gathered beneath the wall where the prophet Complete Novelet of Inhuman Bondage Someone Bung shield
Kialch Pan Plays His Pipes and Rushing Wind By HENRY KUTTNER uthor of The nresting Dead The Frog etc
Roars Through the Cradle of Mankind
STRANGE STORIES stood
Mocking rough taunts were voices but for time the white bearded oldster paid no heed to the gibes
His sunken eyes beneath their snowy penthouse brows dwelt on the far distance where forest swept up into the mountain slopes and faded into blue haze
His voice came thin piercing
Wo wo unto Sardopolis
Fallen is Jewel of Gobi fallen and lost for ever and all its glory gone
Dese cration shall come to the altars and the streets shall run red with blood
see death for the king and shame for his people
For time the soldiers beneath the wall had been silent but now spears lifted they interrupted with tor rent of halfamused mockery
bearded giant roared Come down to us old goat
Well welcome you indeed
THE prophets eyes dropped and the shouting of the soldiers faded into stillness
Very softly the ancient spoke yet each word was clear and distinct as swordblade
Ye shall ride through the streets of the city in triumph
And your king shall mount the silver throne
Yet from the forest shall come your doom an old doom shall come down upon you and none shall escape
He shall return He the mighty one who dwelt here once
The prophet lifted his arms star ing straight into the red eye of the rising sun
Then he stepped forward
Two steps and plunged
Straight down his beard and robe streaming up till the upthrust spears caught him and he died
And that day the gates of Sar dopolis were burst in by giant bat teringrams and like an unleashed flood the men of Cyaxares poured into the city wolves who slew and plundered and tortured mercilessly
Terror walked that day and haze of battle hung upon the roofs
The defenders were hunted down and slaughtered in the streets without mercy
Women were outraged their children impaled and the glory of Sardopolis faded in smoke of shame and horror
The last glow of the setting sun touched the scarlet wyvern of Cyaxares floating from the tallest tower of the kings palace
Flambeaux were lighted in their sockets till the great hall blazed with red fire reflected from the silver throne where the invader sat
His black beard was all bespattered with blood and grime and slaves groomed him as he sat among his men gnawing on muttonbone
Yet despite the mans gashed and broken armor and the filth that besmeared him there was something unmistak ably regal about his bearing
kings son was Cyaxares the last of line that had sprung from the dawn ages of Gobi when the feudal barons had reigned
But his face was tragic ruin
Strength and power and nobility had once dwelt there and traces of them still could be seen as though in muddy water through the mask of cruelty and vice that lay heavy upon Cyaxares
His gray eyes held cold and passionless stare that van ished only in the crimson blaze of battle and now those deadly eyes dwelt on the bound form of the con quered king of Sardopolis Chalem
In contrast with the huge figure of Cyaxares Chalem seemed slight yet despite his wounds he stood stiffly upright no trace of expression on his pale face
strange contrast
The marbled tapestried throneroom of the palace was more suitable to gay pageantry than this grim scene
The only man who did not seem incongruously out of place stood beside the throne slim dark youth clad in silks and velvets that had apparently not been marred by the battle
This was Necho the kings confidant and some said his familiar demon
Whence he had come no one knew but of his evil power over Cyaxares there was no doubt little smile grew on the youths handsome face
Smoothing his curled dark hair he leaned close and whis pered to the king
The latter nodded waved away maiden who was oiling his beard and said shortly Your power is broken Chalem CURSED BE THE CITY Yet are we merciful
Render homage and you may have your life
For answer Chalem spat upon the marble flags at his feet
curious gleam came into Cy axares eyes
Half inaudibly he mur mured brave man
Too brave to die
Some impulse seemed to pull his head around until he met Nechos gaze
message passed in that si lent staring
For Cyaxares took from his side long bloodstained sword he rose stepped down from his dais and swung the brand
CHALEM made no move to evade the blow
The steel cut through bone and brain
As the dead man fell Cyaxares stood looking down without trace of expression
He wrenched his sword free
Fling this carrion to the vul tures he commanded
From the group of prisoners near by came an angry oath
The king turned to face the man who had dared to speak
He gestured
pair of guards pushed forward tall wellmuscled figure yellow haired with face strong despite its youth now darkened with rage
The man wore no armor and his torso was crisscrossed with wounds
Who are you
Cyaxares asked with ominous restraint the sword bare in his hand
King Chalems son Prince Ray nor
You seek death
Raynor shrugged
Death has come close to me today
Slay me if you will
Ive butchered about dozen of your wolves anyway and thats some satisfaction
Behind Cyaxares came rustle of silks as Necho moved slightly
The kings lips twitched beneath the shaggy beard
His face was sud denly hard and cruel again
Well you will crawl to my feet before the next sun sets
He gestured
No doubt there are tor ture vaults beneath the palace
Su drach
brawny leather clad man stepped forward and saluted
You have heard my will
See to it
If crawl to your feet Raynor said quietly itll be to hamstring you bloated toad
The king drew in his breath with an angry sound
Without another word he nodded to Sudrach and the torturer followed Raynor as he was conducted out
Then Cyaxares went back to his throne and mused for time till slave brought him wine in gilded chalice
But the liquor had no power to break his dark mood
At last he rose and went to the dead kings apartments which the invaders had not dared to plunder for fear of Cy axares wrath
Above the silken couch gleaming image hung from its standard the scarlet wyvern wings spread barbed tail stiffly up right
Cyaxares stood silently star ing at it for space
He did not turn when he heard Nechos soft voice
The youth said The wyvern has conquered once again
Aye Cyaxares said dully
Once again through vileness and black shame
It was an evil day when we met Necho
Low laughter came
Yet you sum moned me as remember
was content enough in my own place till you sent your summons
Involuntarily the king shuddered
would Ishtar had sent down her lightnings upon me that night
You worship another god now
Cyaxares swung about snarling
Necho do not push me too far
have still some power You have all power the low voice said
As you wished
For dozen heartbeats the king made no answer
Then he whispered am the first to bring shame upon our royal blood
When was crowned swore many vow on the tombs of my fathers and for time kept those vows
ruled with truth and chivalry And you sought wisdom
was not content
sought to make my name great and to that end talked with sorcerers with Bleys of the Dark Pool
Bleys Necho murmured
He STRANGE STORIES was learned in his way
Yet he died
The kings breathing was unsteady
slew him at your com mand
And you showed me what happened thereafter
Bleys is not happy now Necho said softly
He served the same master as you
Wherefore The quiet voice grew imperious
Where fore live
For by our bargain shall give you all power on earth fair women and treasure beyond imagina tion
But when you die you shall serve me
The other stood silent while veins swelled on his swarthy forehead
Suddenly with bellowing inarticu late oath he snatched up his sword
Bright steel flamed through the air and rebounded clashing
Up the kings arm and through all his body raced tingling shock and simul taneously the regal apartment seemed to darken around him
The fires of the flambeaux darkened
The air was chill and it whispered
Steadily the room grew blacker
Now all was midnight black save for shining figure that stood im mobile blazing with weird and un earthly radiance
Little murmurs rustled through the deadly stillness
The body of Necho shone brighter blindingly
And he stood without moving or speaking till the king shrank with shuddering cry his blade clattering on the marble
he half sobbed
For His mercy no
He has no mercy the low voice came bleak and chill
Therefore worship me dog whom men call king
Worship me
And Cyaxares worshiped
CHAPTER II Blood in the City PRINCE RAYNOR was acutely uncomfortable
He was stretched upon rack staring up at the drip ping stones of the vaults roof and Sudrach the torturer was heating iron bars on the hearth
great cup of wine stood nearby and occa sionally Sudrach humming under his breath would reach for it and gulp noisily
thousand pieces of gold if you help me escape Raynor repeated without much hope
What good is gord to flayed man
Sudrach asked
That would be my fate if you escaped
Also where would you get thousand golden pieces
In my apartment Raynor said
Safely hidden
You may be lying
At any rate youll tell me where this hiding place is when burn out your eyes
Thus Ill have the gold if it exists without danger to myself
Raynor made no answer but in stead tugged at the cords that bound him
They did not give
Yet Raynor strained until blood throbbed in his temples and was no closer to free dom when he relaxed at last
Youll but wear yourself out Sudrach said over his shoulder
Best save your strength
Youll need it for screaming
He took an iron bar from the fire
Its end glowed redly and Raynor watched the implement with fascinated hor ror
An unpleasant way to die
But as the glowing bar approached Raynors chest there came an inter ruption
The iron door was flung open and tall hugemuscled black entered
Sudrach turned involuntar ily lifting the bar as weapon
Then he relaxed his eyes questioning
Who the devil are you
he grunted
Eblik the Nubian said the black bowing
bear message from the king
lost my way in this damned palace and just now blundered to my goal
The king has two more prisoners for your hands
Sudrach rubbed his hands
Where are they
In the The other stepped closer
He fumbled in his belt
Then abruptly bloodreddened dagger flashed up and sheathed it self in flesh
Sudraoh bellowed thrust out clawing hands
He doubled up slowly while his attacker leaped CURSED BE THE CITY free and then he collapsed upon the dank stones and lay silent twitching little
The gods be praised
Raynor grunted
Eblik faithful servant you come in time
Ebliks dark gargoylish face was worried
Let me He slashed the cords that bound the prisoner
It wasnt easy
When we were separated in the battle master knew Sardopolis would fall
changed clothes with one of Cy axares men whom slew and waited my chance to escape
It was by the merest luck that heard you had offended the king and were to be tortured
So He shrugged
Raynor free at last sprang up from the rack stretching his stif fened muscles
Will it be easy to escape
Many are drunk or asleep
At any rate we cant stay here
The two slipped cautiously out into the corridor
guard lay dead weltering in his blood not far away
They hurried past him and silently threaded their way through the pal ace more than once dodging into passages to evade detection
If knew where Cyaxares slept Id take my chances on slitting his throat Raynor said
This way
At the end of narrow hall was door which pushed open showed moonlit expanse of garden
Eblik said remember entered this way
Here He dived into bush and presently emerged with sword and heavy battleax the latter he thrust in his girdle
What now
Over the wall Raynor said and led the way
The high rampart was not easy to scale but spreading tree grew close to it and eventually the two had surmounted the barrier
As Raynor dropped lightly to the ground he heard sudden cry and glancing around saw group of men armor gleaming in the moon light racing toward him
He cursed softly
Eblik was already fleeing his long legs covering the yards with amaz ing speed
Raynor followed though his first impulse was to wait and give battle
But in the stronghold of Cyaxares such an action would have been suicidal
Behind the pair the pursuers bayed menace
Swords came out flashing
Raynor clutched his comrades arm dragged him into side alley and the two sped on frantically search ing for hidingplace
It was Eblik who found sanctuary five minutes later
Passing the bloodsmeared corpselittered courtyard of tem ple he gasped hasty word and in moment both Raynor and Eblik were across the moonlit stretch and fleeing into the interior of the tem ple
From high roof hung golden ball dim in the gloom
This was the sacred house of the Sun the dwell ing place of the primal god Ahmon
Eblik had been here before and knew the way
He guided Raynor past torn tapestries and overthrown censers and then halting before golden curtain he listened
There was no sound of pursuit
the Nubian warrior said
Ive heard of secret way out of here though where it is dont know
Maybe we can find it
ME drew the curtain aside and the two entered the sanctuary of the god
Involuntarily Raynor whis pered curse and his brown fingers tightened on his rapier hilt
small chamber faced them with walls and floor and ceiling blue as the summer sky
It was empty save for single huge sphere of gold in the center
Broken upon the gleaming ball was man
From the wall single flambeau cast flickering radiance on the twisted bloodstained body on the white beard that was dappled with blood
The man lay stretched across the globe his hands and feet im paled with iron spikes that had been driven deeply into the gold
Froth bubbled on his lips
His hoary head rolled eyes stared un seeingly
He gasped Water
For the love of Ahmon drop of water
Raynors lips were hard white STRANGE STORIES line as he sprang forward
Eblik helped him as he pried the spikes free
The tortured priest moaned and bit at his mangled lips but made no outcry
Presently he lay prostrate on the blue floor
With muttered word Eblik disappeared and came back bearing cup which he held to the dying mans mouth
The priest drank deeply
He whis pered Prince Raynor
Is the King safe
Swiftly Raynor answered
The others white head rolled
Lift me up swiftly
Raynor obeyed
The priest ran his hands over the golden sphere and suddenly beneath his probing fin gers it split in half like cloven fruit and in its center gap wid ened
steep staircase led down into hidden depths
The altar is open
cannot see welL Take me down there
They cannot find us in the hidden cham ber
Raynor swung the priest to his shoulders and without hesitation started down the steps Eblik behind him
There was low grating as the altar swung back gleaming sphere that would halt and baffle pursuit
They were in utter darkness
The prince moved cautiously testing each step before he shifted his weight
At last he felt the floor level be neath his feet
SLOWLY dim light began to grow like the first glow of dawn
It revealedi bare stone vault roughly constructed of mortised stones strangely at variance with the palatial city above
In one wall dark hole showed
On the floor was circular disk of metal its center hollowed out into cup
Within this cup lay broken shard of some rock that resembled goldshot marble half as large as Raynors hand
On the shard were carved certain sym bols the prince did not recognize and one that he did the ancient looped cross sacred to the sungod
He put the priest down gently but nevertheless the man moaned in agony
The maimed hands clutched at air
Great Ahmon
give me more water
Eblik obeyed
Strengthened the priest fumbled for and gripped Ray nors arm
You are strong
Strength is needed for the mission you must undertake
The priests fingers tightened
Aye Ahmon guided your steps hither
You must be the messenger of vengeance
Not have not long to live
My strength ebbs
He was silent for time and then resumed have tale to tell you
Do you know the legend of the founding of Sardopolis
How long ago very terrible god had his altar in this spot and was served by all the forest dwellers
till those who served Ahmon came
They fought and prisoned the forest god drove him hence to the Valley of Silence and he lies bound there by strong magic and the seal of Ahmon
Yet there was prophecy that one day Ahmon would be overthrown and the bound god would break his fetters and return to his first dwell ing place to the ruin of Sardopolis
The day of the prophecy is at hand
The priest pointed
All is dark
Yet the seal should be there is it not
Raynor said bit of marble Aye the talisman
Lift it up
The voice was now peremptory
Ray nor obeyed
have it
Guard it well
Lift the disk now
Almost apprehensively the prince tugged the disk up finding it cu riously light
Beneath was nothing but jagged stone crudely carved with archaic figures and symbols
stone yet Raynor knew somehow that the thing was horribly old that it had existed from the dawn ages of Gobi
The altar of the forest god said the priest
He will return to this spot when he is freed
You must go to the Reaver of the Rock and give him the talisman
He will know its meaning
So shall Ahmon be avenged upon the tyrant
CURSED BE THE CITY Suddenly the priest surged up right his arms lifted tears streaming from the blind eyes
He cried Ohe ohi
Fallen forever is the House of Ahmon
Fallen to the dust
He fell as tree falls crashing down upon the stones his arms still extended as though in worship
So died the last priest of Ahmon in Gobi
Raynor did not move for while
Then he bent over the lax body
hasty examination showed him that the man was dead and shrugging he thrust the marble shard into his belt
suppose thats the way out he said pointing to the gap in the wall though dont like the look of it
Well come on
He squeezed himself into the nar row hole cursing softly and Eblik followed
CHAPTER III The Reaver of the Rock WITH slow steps Cyaxares paced his apartment his shaggy brows drawn together in frown
Once or twice his hand closed con vulsively on his swordhilt and again the secret agony within him made him groan aloud
But not once did he glance at the scarlet symbol of the wyvern that hung above his couch
Going to window he looked down over the city and then his gaze went out to the plain and the distant forested mountains
He sighed heavily
voice said You may well look there Cyaxares
For there is your doom unless you act swiftly
Is it you Necho
the king asked heavily
What new shamefulness must work now
Two men go south to the Valley of Silence
They must be slain ere they reach it
What aid can they get there
Nccho did not answer at first
His voice was hesitant when he said The gods have their own secrets
There is something in the Valley of Silence that can send all your glory and power crashing down about your head
Nor can aid you then
can only advise you now and if you fol low my advice well
But act can not and must not for reason which you need not know
Send out your men therefore with orders to over take those two and slay them swiftly
As you will the king said and turned to summon servitor
ffJOLDIERS follow us Eblik said shading his eyes with calloused hand
He was astride rangy dun mare and beside him Ray nor rede on great gray charger red of nostril and fiery of eye
The lat ter turned in the saddle and looked back
By the gods
he observed
Cy axares has sent half an army after us
Its lucky we managed to steal these mounts
The two had reined their horses at the summit of low rise in the forest
Back of them the ground sloped to the great plain and the gutted city of Sardopolis before them jagged mountains rose covered with oak and pine and fir
The Nu bian licked dry lips said thirstily The fires of all hells are in my belly
Lets get out of this wilder ness where theres nothing to drink but water
The Reaver may feed you wine or blood Raynor said Neverthe less our best chance is to find this Reaver and
seek his aid
mer cenary once told me of the road
He clapped his heels against the chargers flanks and the steed bounded forward
In moment the ridge had hidden them from the men of Cyaxares
So the two pene trated deeper and deeper into the craggy desolate wilderness place haunted by wolves and great bears and men whispered monstrous snakelike cockadrills
They went by snowpeaked moun tains that lifted white cones to the STRANGE STORIES blue sky and they fled along the brink of deep gorges from which the low thunder of cataracts rose tumultuously
And always behind them rode the pursuers grim and warlike company following slowly but relentlessly
But Raynor used more than one stratagem
Thrice he guided his charger up streams along which the wise animal picked its way care fully again he dislodged an ava lanche to block the trail
So it came about that when the two rode down into great grassy basin the men of Cyaxares were far behind
On all sides the mountains rose
Ahead was broad meadowlike valley strewn with thickets and green groves
Far ahead the preci pice rose in tall rampart split in one place into narrow canyon
To the right of the gorge lifted great gray rock mountainhuge bare save for winding trail that twisted up its surface to castle upon the summit
Dwarfed by dis tance the size of the huge structure could yet be appreciated castle of stone incongruously bedecked with fluttering bright banners and pen nons
Raynor pointed
He dwells there
The Reaver of the Rock
And here comes danger Eblik said whipping out his battleax
From grove of nearby trees burst company of horsemen glittering in the afternoon sunlight spears lifted casques and helms agleam
Shouting they rode down upon the waiting pair
Raynor fingered his swordhilt hesitating
Put up your blade he directed Eblik
We come in friendship here
The Nubian was doubtful
But do they know that
Nevertheless he sheathed his sword and waited till the dozen riders reined in few paces away
One spurred forward tall man astride wiry black
Are you tired of life that you seek the Reavers stronghold
he demanded
Or do you mean to en ter in his service
We bear message Raynor countered
message from priest of Ahmon
We know no gods here the other grunted
Well you know warfare or Ive misread the dents in your armor Raynor snapped
Sardopolis is fallen
Cyaxares has taken the city and slain the king my father Chalem of Sardopolis
TO his amazement bellow of laughter burst from the troop
The spokesman said What has that to do with us
We own no king but the Reaver
Yet you shall come safely before him if that is your will
It were shameful to battle dozen to two and the rags you wear arent worth the taking
Eblik started like ruffled pea cock
By the gods you have little courtesy here
For coin Id slit your weasand
The other rubbed his throat re flectively grinning
You may have trial at that later if you wish my ragged gargoyle
But come now for the Reaver is in hall and tonight he rides forth on raid
With nod Raynor spurred his horse forward the Nubian at his side and surrounded by the men of the Reaver they fled across the val ley to the castle
Thence they mounted the steep dangerous path up the craggy ramp till at last they crossed drawbridge and dismounted in courtyard
So they took Raynor before the Reaver of the Rock
great shining redcheeked man he was with grizzled gray beard and crown set rakishly askew on tan gled locks
He sat before blazing fire in highroofed stone hall an iron chest open at his feet
From this he was taking jewels and golden chains and ornaments that might have graced kings treasury exam ining them carefully and making notes with quill pen upon parch ment on his lap
He looked up merry eyes dwelt on Raynors flushed face and touseled yellow hair
Well Samar what is it now
CURSED BE THE CITY Two strangers
They have mes sage for you or so they say
Suddenly the Reavers face changed
He leaned forward spilling treasure from his lap
Now there is only one message that can ever come to me
speak you
Who sent you
AYNOR stepped forward confi dently
From his belt he drew the broken shard of marble and ex tended it
priest of Ahmon bade me give you this he said
Sardopolis is fallen
For heartbeat there was silence
Then the Reaver took the shard ex amining it carefully
He murmured Aye
So my rule passes
For long and long my fathers held the Rock waiting for the summons that never came
And now it has come
He looked up
Go all of you save you two
And you Samar wait for you should know of this
The others departed
The Reaver shouted after them Summon Del phia
He turned to stare into the fire
So Kialeh must fulfill the ancient pledge of my ancestors
And in vaders are on my marches
Well There came an interruption
girl strode in dark head proudly erect slim figure corseted in dinted armor
She went to the Reaver flung blazing jewel in his lap
Is this my guerdon
she snarled Faith the gods took Ossans castle almost singlehanded
And my share is less than the share of Samar here
You are my daughter the Reaver said quietly
Shall give you more honor then in our free brotherhood
Be silent
Raynor was examining the girls face with approval
There was beauty there wild dark lawless beauty and strength that showed in the firm set of the jaw and the latent fire of the jet eyes
Ebony hair unbound fell in ringlets about steelcorseleted shoulders
The girl said Well
Have you had your fill of staring
Let be the Reaver grunted
have tale for all of you
His deep voice grew stronger
Ages on ages ago this was bar barous land
The people worshipped forestgod called his hand moved in queer quick sign called Pan
Then from the north came two kings brothers bringing with them the power of the sungod Ahmon
There was battle in the land then and blood and reddened steel
Yet Ahmon conquered
The forestgod was bound within the Valley of Silence which lies be yond my castle
The two kings made an agreement
One was to rule Sar dopolis and the other the younger was to rear great castle at the gateway of the Valley of Silence and guard the fettered god
Until certain word should come
The Reaver weighed glittering stone in his hand
For there was prophecy that one day the rule of Ahmon should be broken
Then it was foretold that the forestgod should be freed and should bring vengeance upon the destroyers of Sardopolis
For long and long my ancestors have guarded the Rock and Kialeh am the last
Ah he sighed
The great days are over indeed
Never again will the Reaver ride to rob and plunder and mock at gods
Never whats this
manatarms had burst into the hall eyes alight face fierce as wolfs
An army is in the valley By Shaitan
Raynor cursed
Cyaxares men
They pursued us The girl Delphia swung about
Gather the men
Ill take com mand Suddenly the Reaver let out roaring shout
By all the gods Ive flouted no
Would you grudge me my last battle girl
Gather your men Samar but command
Samar sprang to obey
Delphia gripped her fathers arm
fight with you then
have another task for you
Guide these two through the Valley of Silence to the place you know
Here he thrust the marble shard at the prince
Take this
Youll STRANGE STORIES know how to use it when the time comes
Then he was gone and curtains of black samite swayed into place be hind him
Raynor was curiously eying the girl
Her face was pale beneath its tan and her eyes betrayed fear
Red battle she could face unflinchingly but the thought of entering the Val ley of Silence meant to her some thing far more terrible
Yet she said Come
We have little time
Eblik followed Raynor and Del phia from the hall
They went through the harsh splendor of the castle till at last the girl halted be fore blank stone wall
She pressed hidden spring
section of the rock swung away revealing the dim lit depths of passage
Delphia paused on the threshold
Her dark eyes flickered over the two
Hold fast to your courage she whispered and her Hps were trem bling
For now we go down into HelL
CHAPTER IV The Valley of Silence TT at first there seemed nothing terrible about the valley
They entered it from cavern that opened on thick forest and glancing around Raynor saw tall mountainous ramparts that made the place prison indeed
It was past sunset yet already full moon was rising over the eastern cliffs outlining the Reavers castle in black silhouette
They entered the forest
Moss underfoot deadened their footsteps
They walked in dim gloom broken by moonlit traceries filtered through the leaves
And now Raynor noted the curious stillness that hung over all
There was no sound
The noise of birds and beasts did not exist here nor did the breath of wind rustle the silent trees
But queerly the prince thought there was sound whisper ing through the forest sound be low the threshold of hearing which nevertheless played on his taut nerves
dont like this Eblik said his ugly face set and strained
His voice seemed to die away with uncanny swiftness
Pan is fettered here Delphia whispered
Yet is his power mani fest
Soundlessly they went through the soundless forest
And now Raynor realized that slowly and impercep tibly the shadowy whisper he had sensed was growing louder or else his ears were becoming more attuned to it
very dim murmur faint and far away which yet seemed to have within it multitude of voices
The voices of the winds
the murmur of forests
the goblin laughter of shadowed brooks
It was louder now and Raynor found himself thinking of all the in numerable sounds of the primeval wilderness
Birdnotes and the call of beasts
And under all dim powerful motif beat wordless shrilling faint piping that set the princes skin to crawling as he heard it
It is the tide of life Delphia said softly
The heartbeat of the first god
The pulse of earth
For the first time Raynor felt something of the primal secrets of the world
Often he had walked alone in the forest but never yet had the hidden heart of the wilderness reached fingers into his soul
He sensed mighty and very terrible power stirring latent in the soil be neath him thing bound inextric ably to the brain of man by the cords of the flesh which came up by slow degrees from the seething oceans which once rolled unchecked over young planet
Unimaginable eons ago man had come from the earth and the brand of his motherworld was burned deep within his soul
Afraid yet strangely happy as men are sometimes happy in their dreams the prince motioned for his companions to increase their pace
The forest gave place to wide clearing with shattered white stones CURSED BE THE CITY rearing to the sky
Broken plinths and peristyles gleamed in the moon light
temple had once existed here
Now all was overgrown with moss and the slowcreeping lichen
Here the girl said in low whis per
In the center of ring of fallen pillars they halted
Delphia pointed to block of marble on which metal disk was inset
In cuplike depression in the metal lay broken bit of marble
The talisman Delphia said
Touch it to the other
and the unearthly tide of hidden life swelling and ebbing all about them
Raynor took the amulet from his belt stepped for ward fighting down his fear
He bent above the disk touched marble shard to marble As iron to lodes tone the two frag ments drew together
They coalesced into one
The jagged line of break age faded and vanished
Raynor held the talisman com plete unbroken
Now quite suddenly the vague murmurings mounted into roar gay jubilant triumphant
The metal disk shattered into fragments
Be neath it the prince glimpsed small carved stone the twin of the one be neath the temple of Ahmon
Above the unceasing roar sounded penetrating shrill piping
Delphia clutched at Raynor arm pulled him back
Her face was chalk white
The pipes
she gasped
Back quickly
To see Pan is to die
Louder the roar mounted and louder
In its bellow was deep shout of alien laughter thunder of goblin merriment
The chuckle of the shadowed brooks was the crash of cataracts and waterfalls
The forest stirred to breath of gusty wind
the girl said urgently
We have freed Pan
Without conscious thought Raynor thrust the talisman into his belt turned and with Delphia and Eblik beside him fled into the moonlit shadows
Above him branches tossed in mounting wind
The wild shriek ing of the pipes grew louder
Tide of earth life rising to mad paean of triumph
The wind exulted Free
And the unseen rivers shouted Great Pan is free
CLATTERING of hoofs came from the distance
Bleating calls sounded from afar
The girl stumbled almost fell
Ray nor gripped at her arm pulling her upright fighting the unreasoning ter ror mounting within him
The Nu bians grim face was glistening with sweat
Pan Pan is free
The black mouth of cavern loomed before them
At its threshold Raynor cast glance behind him saw all the great forest swaying and tossing
His breath coming unevenly he turned following his companions into the cave
he whispered
What demon have loosed on the land
Then it was race sprint pound up the winding passage up an unending flight of stone steps through wall that lifted at Delphias touch and into castle shaking with battle
Raynor stopped short whipping out his sword staring at shadows flicker ing in the distance
Cyaxares men he said
Theyve entered
In the face of fleshandblood an tagonists the prince was suddenly himself again
Delphia was already running down the corridor blade out
Raynor and the Nubian followed
They burst into the great hall
ring of armed men surrounded little group who were making their last stand before the hearth
Tower ing above the others Raynor saw the tangled locks and bristling beard of Kialeh the Reaver and beside him his lieutenant Samar
Corpses lit tered the floor
roared the Reaver as he caught sight of the newcomers
You come in time
In time to die with us
STRANGE STORIES CHAPTER Cursed Be the City RIM laughter touched Raynors lips
He drove in sheathing his sword in brawny throat whipped it out steel singing
Nor were Eblik and Delphi far behind
Her blade and the Nubians ax wreaked deadly havoc among Cyaxares soldiers who not expecting attack from the rear were confused
The hall became filled with mill ing yelling throng from which one soldier burly giant emerged shout ing down the others
Cut them down
Theyre but three
Then all semblance of sanity was lost in blaze of crimson battle swinging brands and huge maces that crashed down splitting skulls and spattering gray brainstuff
Del phia kept shoulder to shoulder with Raynor seemingly heedless of danger her blade flicking wasplike through the air
And the prince guarded her as best he could the sword weaving bright maze of deadly lightnings as it whirled
The Reaver swung and his sword crushed helm and bit deep into bone
He strained to tug it free and soldier thrust up at his throat
Samar deflected the blade with his own weapon and that cost him his life
In that moment of inattention driven spear smashed through corselet and jerkin and drank deep of the mans lifeblood
Silent he fell
The Reaver went beserk
Yelling he sprang over his lieutenants corpse and swung
For few moments he held back his enemies and then someone flung shield
Instinc tively Kialeh lifted his blade to parry
The wolves leaped in to the kill
Roaring the Reaver went down blood gushing through his shaggy beard staining its irongray with red
When Raynor had time to look again Kialeh lay corpse on his own hearth his head amid bright jewels that had spilled from the overturned treasurechest
The three stood together now the last of the defenders Raynor and Eblik and Delphia
The soldiers ringed them panting for their death yet hesitating before the menace of cold steel
None wished to be the first to die
And as they waited little silence fell
The prince heard sound he remembered
Dim and far away low roaring drifted to his ears
And the eerie shrilling of pipes
It grew louder
The soldiers heard it now
They glanced at one another askance
There was something about that sound that chilled the blood
It swelled to gleeful shouting filling all the castle
breeze blew through the hall tugging with elfin fingers at sweatmoist skin
It rose to gusty blast
In its murmur voices whispered
Evohe They grew louder mad and un checked
They exulted
Pan Pan is free
soldier cursed
What devils work is this
He swung about sword ready
The curtains of samite were ripped away by the shrieking wind
Deafen ingly the voices exulted Pan is free
The piping shrilled out
There came the clatter of ringing little hoofs
The castle rocked and shud dered
Some vague indefinable impulse made Raynor snatch at his belt grip ping the sungods talisman in bronzed fingers
From it grateful warmth seemed to flow into his flesh and the roaring faded
He dragged Delphia and the Nu bian behind him
Close to me
Stay close
The room was darkening
No it seemed as though cloudy veil of mist dropped before the three guard ing them
Raynor lifted the seal of Ahmon
The fogveils swirled
Dimly CURSED BE THE CITY through them Raynor could see the soldiers moving swiftly frantically like rats caught in trap
He tight ened one arm about Delphias steel armored waist
Suddenly the hall was icecold
The castle shook as though gripped by Titan hands
The floor swayed be neath the princes feet
The mists darkened
Through rifts he saw halfguessed figures that leaped and bounded
heard elfin hoofs clicking
Horned and shaggy furred beings that cried jubilantly as they danced to the pipes of Pan
Faun and dryad and satyr swung in mad saraband beyond the shroud ing mists
Faintly there came the screaming of men half drowned in the loud shrilling
the demoniac rout thun dered
All hail Pan
With queer certainty Raynor knew that it was time to leave the castle and swiftly
Already the great stone structure was shaking like tree in hurricane
With word to his companions he stepped forward hesitantly the talisman held high
The walls of mist moved with him
Outside the fogwalls the monstrous figures gamboled
But the soldiers of Cyaxares screamed no more
Through castle toppling into ruin the three sped into the court yard across the drawbridge and down the face of the Rock
Nor did they pause till they were safely in the broad plain of the valley
The castle
Eblik barked point ing
It falls
And it was true
Down it came thundering while clouds of ruin spurted up
Then there was only shattered wreck on the summit of the Rock
Delphia caught her breath in little sob
She murmured The end of the Reavers for all time
lived in the castle for more than twenty years
And now its gone like puff of dust before the wind
The walls of fog had vanished
Raynor returned the talisman to his belt
Eblik staring up at the Rock swallowed uneasily
Well what now
he asked
Back along the way we came the prince said
Its the only way out of this wilderness that know of
The girl nodded
Beyond the mountains lie deserts save to ward Sardopolis
But we have no mounts
Then well walk Eblik observed but Raynor caught his arm and pointed
Horses probably stam peded from the castle
And Shai tan
Theres my gray charger
So presently the three rode to ward Sardopolis conscious of wierd dim throbbing that seemed to pulse in the air all about them
AT dawn they topped ridge and saw before them the plain
All three reined in their mounts staring
Beneath them lay the city but changed
It was ruin
Doom had come to Sardopolis in the night
The mighty towers and battle ments had fallen and huge gaps were opened in the walls
Of the kings palace nothing was left but single tower from which ironically the wyvern banner flew
As they watched that pinnacle too swayed and tottered and fell and the scarlet wyvern drifted down into the dust of Sardopolis
On fallen towers and peristyles distant figures moved with odd un gainly boundings
Quickly Raynor turned his eyes away
But he could not shut his ears to the distant cry ing of pipes gay and pagan yet with faintly mournful undertone
Pan has returned to his first altar Delphia said quietly
We had best not loiter here
By all hell agree the Nubian grunted digging his heels into his steeds flanks
Where now Raynor
Westward think to the Sea of Shadows
There are cities on its shore and galleys to take us to haven
Unless He turned ques tioning eyes on Delphia
She laughed little bitterly
cannot stay here
The land is sunk STRANGE STORIES back into the pit
Pan rules
go with you
The three rode to the west
They skirted but did not enter small grove where man lay in agony
It was Cyaxares figure so dreadfully mangled that only sheer will kept him alive
His face was bloody mask
The oncerich garments were tattered and filthy
He saw the three riders and raised his voice in weak cry which the wind drowned
Beside the king slim youthful figure lounged leaning idly against an oaktrunk
It was Necho
Call louder Cyaxares he said
With horse under you you can reach the Sea of Shadows
And if you succeed in doing that you will yet live for many years
Again the king cried out
The wind took his voice and shredded it to impotent fragments
Necho laughed softly
Too late now
They are gone
CYAXARES let his battered head drop his beard trailing in the dirt
Through shredded lips he mut tered if reach the Sea of Shadows
But if you do not you die
And then Low laughter shook the other
Groaning the king dragged him self forward
Necho followed
good horse can reach the Sea of Shadows in three days
If you walk swiftly you may reach it in six
But you must hurry
Why do you not rise my Cyaxares
The king spat out bitter oaths
In agony he pulled himself forward leaving trail of blood on the grass
blood that dripped unceasingly from the twin raw stumps just above his ankles
The stone that fell upon you was sharp
Cyaxares was it not
Necho mocked
But hurry
You have little time
There are mountains to climb and rivers to cross
So in the trail of Raynor and Eb lik and Delphia crept the dying king hearing fainter and ever fainter the triumphant pipes of Pan from Sardopolis
And presently patient as the silent Necho vulture dipped against the blue and took up the pur suit the beat of its wings distinctly audible in the heavy stagnant si lence
And Raynor and Delphia and Eb lik rode onward toward the sea

LORD OF EVIL Moncati Couldnt Be Positive Until He Developed the Fatal Negative
By TALLY MASON Author oi The Lost Wraith House Darkness etc
OLD WEMYSS gave him the packet without question and Moncati stood politely lis tening to him his head cocked little to one side
His bright dark eyes were smiling coldly but his thin lips remained devoid of any movement
confess Id have been afraid of your stepfather myself said We myss
There were some very strange stories about him and the man him self always impressed me as some thing evil
Wemyss coughed nervously and cast glance over his shoulder to where his law partner was at work on brief
Belatedly lowering his voice he added admire your fearlessness Moncati
Thank you said Moncati and left him
Outside his lips smiled and he said within his mind Wemyss you had the secret
His hand tightened little about the packet and the photograph in it
This kind of blackmail would never have occurred to Wemyss
The second print was authentic but the framed photograph had changed again in the night
STRANGE STORIES As he walked through Piccadilly in the sunlight so unusual for Lon don Moncati held his smile and his thoughts dwelt upon the photograph and the occasion upon which he had taken it
About his stepfather We myss had put it mildly indeed
Mon cati himself had heard the old man boast am the Lord of Evil
Sure of himself
Moncati remembered it well and had reason to believe it on natural grounds
Wemyss had not been wrong when he had warned him that the old man had an eye on the legacy coming to Moncati at twentyfive
Moncatis dabbling in photography had saved his life just as Teddifer his stepfather was preparing to leap upon him fingers already curved for his throat the flashlight bulb had gone off
Moncati had risen from his simu lated sleep thrust Teddifer away and gone with the camera and film
He remembered yet the fury and chagrin on the old mans face when he had learned about Moncatis elab orate precautions but he remem bered too that already then he had known that some day he would have to take other steps
MONCATI paused to tear into little pieces the letter that had been with the packet for Wemyss which began In case of my death please forward immediately to In spector Winslow at New Scotland Yard
and went on chuckling to himself now lighthearted and gay with eyes for every pretty girl he met
Deep in his mind he was well sat isfied with himself as proud as old Teddifer had ever been of his magic and necromancy and not little scornful of the evil old man who had come to such prosaic and untimely end
Moncati felt not qualm at re membering how carefully he had tied the cord which had tripped Teddifer at the head of the stairs and left him at the bottom with his scrawny neck broken
After all Moncati had had every provocation he had known that by some design or other Ted difer had meant to accomplish his death and take his legacy and the thought had irritated and at last had worried him into action
If fly bothers me kill it he had told himself then
Why Hot Teddifer
When Moncati reached home he unpacked the enlarged photograph found frame and hung the picture on the wall squarely over his desk so that he might remind himself from time to time of his own clever ness in circumventing the evil old man who had been his stepfather
He had already burnt up most of Teddi fers books and papers and had be gun to rearrange the house to suit his own convenience
He went whistling up the stairs and left the picture there in the patch of sunlight on the wall the evilfaced old man with head half turned toward the hidden camera and the flare that had surprised him Moncati himself in bed the glare of light that made strikingly clear the huge cruel old hands and the de signing mind behind
The sunlight was additionally merciless and there the picture hung Moncati in bed and Hercules Teddifer about to reach for his neck
For some days the picture com forted Moncati it gave him deep seated feeling of contentment of sat isfaction with himself and the world and he glanced at it smiling once or twice day
Then he went down to Sussex for weekend and when he came back he felt for the first time disquieting note about the picture
It was something intangible some thing upon which he could not put finger but it was there
The photograph gave him the old pleasure and satisfaction but there was something more something ma levolent about it and he was irritated to think he did not know what it was
For brief moment he thought that the old mans expression had subtly altered become more calcu lating but being careful about his imagination he dismissed the thought
Two evenings later as he sat at his desk writing difficult letter he glanced absently up at the photo LORD OF EVIL graph and saw movement there
Because the indirect light threw diffused glow over the picture he thought at first that the movement he had seen was normal hallucina tion springing from the slight re focusing of his gaze from paper to photograph but almost instantly his eyes fixed unconsciously upon the spot where he had thought the move ment to have been Hercules Teddi fers hands
With faint tremor he knew that he had seen the old mans large bony hands flex open and close and he involuntarily waited fascinated for the hands to move again
But only for second
He recollected himself and turned the light full upon the photograph faint feeling of panic guiding his hand
He looked at it closely but noth ing happened there was nothing changed about it and he suffered brief moment of distaste before he felt the old pleasure creep over him again the sense of proud security he had made for himself by so fortunately ridding himself of his menacing step father
He sat down again presently and resumed the letter but every little while he caught himself looking ex pectantly up at the photograph watching nervously and uncertainly so that in the end he was obliged to give up the letter somehow his mind would not return to it would not concentrate properly on the task before it
With faintly derisive smile half for himself half for the photograph he left the desk
He had no doubt that his eyes had played trick on him and he slept well that night without dreams
He rose in the morning got at his letter again and finished it without any trouble
On his way out of the house to the Victoria and Albert Museum he gave the photograph fleeting glance with his customary good humor and went whistling into the mornings fog
Not until he was seated comfort ably in the underground did it occur to him that Hercules Teddifers face as he had seen it in the photograph that morning was no longer turned toward the hidden camera
He had not actually realized it at first but his eyes had seen the image had been transmitted and now suddenly he remembered it with certain def initeness which he found difficult to escape
The possibility of any physical change in the photograph was too absurd to entertain seriously he be gan to think very clearly around what his eyes had seen in an attempt to find some explanation of it
But the more he thought the greater his confusion grew until he knew that he must return to the house and as sure himself that such change had not actually taken place
He made mental note at the same time to see about his eyes glasses certainly were indicated
HE let himself in the house with trepidation and went directly to the picture
He looked and looked again stepped back little and stared his mind in outraged tumult
There was change
The old mans face no longer peered out at him in stead it had turned ever so slightly and taken new cognizance of the fig ure in the bed the head bent little and the eyes lost in contemplation
It was incredible but it was true
Moncati took the photograph off its hook and peered closely at it
He rubbed his fingers over it as if be might feel some subtle difference his eyes could not see but there was nothing
Baffled he put it back and stood looking at it for long time until he became conscious of the fact that he was waiting for change to take place there before his eyes
Then angry with himself he turned away and went grimly out of the house intending to complete the days itinerary as he had set it for himself
But somehow before he knew it the museum palled on him and he found himself sitting down to tea with old Wemyss who eyed him little askance
Investment trouble
asked the barrister
Moncati shook his head
No dan STRANGE STORIES ger of that
Ive just developed some curiosity about my late stepfather
Wemyss put on his pincenez and looked at him
God bless my soul
he exclaimed
Whats put you in mind of him now
Hes dead and the worlds the better for it you particularly
Moncati smiled his most persuasive smile
Agreed Mr Wemyss but have reasonable amount of curios ity and Id rather like to know some thing of the nature of those strange stories about which you hinted the last time called on you
Wemyss eyes narrowed
What misguided impulse roused your cu riosity
he asked
Moncati shrugged
Is it mis guided
hesitate to talk about things dont myself understand and yet must put some belief in replied Wemyss because dislike being held up to ridicule even if only in the private opinions of my clients
dont suppose you believe in such things as magic and sorcery eh
Moncati smiled pleasantly and said
Only fool refuses to keep an open mind
Well said answered Wemyss shortly
Teddifer practised that sort of thing squares and circles and spirit rites and such
dont hold with it myself but understand that some very unusual occurrences took place in that house of his
Wemyss shrugged little irri tated but went on
The best can say is that some people died very oddly servants
Two that know of
Both strangled
But of course your stepfather was out of the city at the time
No question about that
Wemyss smiled little oddly with kind of menace behind his lips
He had some queer theories about the projection of psychic doubles and astrals and the like for that matter no one ever found any prints of any kind on those two dead serv ants
Of sudden Wemyss gulped his tea and was off saying over his shoulder God bless my soul
Ive forgotten my appointment with Dot son
Moncati waved at his back but he was puzzled the inference behind Wemyss words was clear enough and somehow Moncati could not get his thoughts away from Hercules Teddifers huge ungainly hands the tough clawlike appendages that had so greedily threatened his own throat
He shook himself presently paid for the tea and wandered somewhat re lunctantly homeward
HE looked at the picture but there was no further change
He was conscious of slight feeling of relief but this was dissipated at once in the memory of that first change
He took the photograph down again and examined it anew but could discover nothing remarkable about it
For the first time he began to be aware of something akin to fear he began to search his memory for some clue to this strange occurrence and at the same time he began to cast around for some manner of escape from the intangible dread he had be un to feel insidiously drawing upon him from the recesses of his mind malignant dread akin to that same fear he had known when first he had be come aware of his stepfathers evil design to kill him
Doggedly he put the picture back on the wall and went about his small tasks
By evening he had sufficiently recovered his composure to contem plate coolly some means of combat ting the subtle dread that lay in the back of his mind
He could not re frain from looking at the picture again but there was no further change and he felt renewal of faith in him self
He had thought once fleetingly of burning the picture but this seemed to him somehow reflection upon the resourcefulness and courage that had brought it into being and he could not contemplate with equanim ity the resultant drain upon his self esteem
Throughout the evening he sat in the room reading his desk light thrown upward upon the picture but nothing happened nothing what ever
He had come almost to expect LORD OF EVIL some further development but this absence of anything again set him doubting what he had first seen
Had there been any change in the first place
Or had his imagination overreached itself
Certain as he was that the old man had first been looking out at him from the photo graph he was equally certain that he was now no longer doing so but if this change had indeed taken place it was utterly against natural law
This thought gave him but little comfort until he realized that he could settle the question of whether or not his imagination had been re miss by taking the negative and hav ing separate print made for com parison
At once he was flooded with strange feeling of freedom from dread he felt that he was about to do the right thing
The possibility that his confidence did not come en tirely from within himself did not occur to him
In the morning he took the nega tive and made second print en larged to the same size as the orig inal
He came to his desk with it and stood it up below the framed photograph
What he saw was so far from re assuring that he caught hold of chair and eased himself into it
Not only was the second print as he had originally believed the framed photo graph to have been but the latter had again changed in the night Her cules Teddifer had moved closer to the figure in the bed and his hands were clenched
Moncati began to perspire coldly
For moment he sat there at loss to know what to do and he thought confusedly of the old mans strange beliefs
Somehow it had not before occurred to him that by photograph ing the old man he had managed however obscurely to himself to per petuate Teddifer and his evil design
But in the height of his misery hope came to him
He came to his feet and in two strides had torn the pho tograph from the wall
Three minutes later all that was left was small drift of ashes
He was utterly relieved at once
How the old man could have man aged recourse to his magic sorcery in this way was beyond Moncati but the knowledge that he had circum vented him second time was not
His opinion of himself soared
He went out to celebrate
He made night of it hilariously told some acquaintances that he was celebrating his freedom and congratulated him self upon shaking off the dread he had known so briefly again
He came in late after midnight his mind little sluggish and threw himself partly dressed on to his bed where he fell asleep at once
Not quite an hour later he awoke
The clock had struck two and he lay drowsily staring into the darkness for some minutes before he heard the sound like the rattling and rustling of paper
Even at that he did not come fully awake he pondered the sound sleepily and was not aware of its approach until it was almost upon his room
THEN he listened carefully won dering what it might be
It was like nothing he had ever heard be fore save for its dry rustling and crackling
He raised himself tiredly on one elbow just as the door of his room opened
This distracted him momen tarily from the sound of movement and he thought draft had drawn it open for at the moment there was nothing but darkness flowing in upon him
Not until an uncanny chill per vaded his senses did he realize that the darkness he saw was not the shadows in the hall but that it was something alive something malig nant
Instantly he was caught in cloud of dread he saw the darkness resolve itself into dim human fig ure one side aglow as if light were falling upon it and heard dry chuckling all too familiar
It was Hercules Teddifers grim face that looked down upon him
Even as an outcry rose to Mon catis lips the ungainly hands closed around his neck
The last thing Moncati remem bered was the thing he had unfor tunately forgotten the second print
BOX from the STARS Complete Novelet of Matter Over Mind
By AMELIA REYNOLDS LONG Author of The Undead The Mechanical Man etc
CHAPTER The Empty Cube WAS with Chatham when he discovered the box and can still remember his cry of de light and surprise when he unearthed it
We had been doing bit of fos sil hunting on piece of land of his in southeastern Pennsylvania where spur of primal rock strata reared its head practically to the surface
So far we had found little more than the usual fossil shells and few fern impressions so battered by time that they were practically worthless
But this was different
At his shout left my own dig ging little distance away and joined him
He was standing over what looked like pocket in the solid rock formed by some freak folding of the strata back in pre glacial times
Look Wilder
he exclaimed It Was Hollow But Not Empty Nothing jubilantly
was trying to chip off this upper layer when my pick went straight through
What do you make of it
got down on my hands and knees and peered into the opening he had made
saw what he was raving about
The pocket extended foot or two in all directions beyond the opening and about four feet downward
And resting flat upon its bottom was rectangular shaped object
What the dickens
exclaimed and began to pry away pieces of the loose rock with my hands
What is it
He got down beside me
Looks as though it might be manmade doesnt it
Nature doesnt work in such perfect cubes
dont know replied thought Was In It But Nothing WasSomething
STRANGE STORIES fully although the same idea had flashed across my own mind
There are certain slate formations But this isnt slate he inter rupted
He picked up shard of the dull colored rock
Its igneous stuff
Much older than slate
But later than the surrounding rock apparently said
scram bled to my feet
Lets enlarge the opening and see what youve found
few blows of our picks cleared away the top of the pocket giving us an unobstructed view into the cavity beneath
It now measured about four feet in all of its dimen sions with the two foot cube resting upon the middle of its floor
Ill drop in and pass it out to you Chatham said
Then we can examine it better
Think you can manage it alone
It looks as though it were made of solid metal
Ill try he answered letting him self down into the hole
If cant well attach ropes
He knelt in the confined space and wrapped his arms about the cube his muscles swelling beneath his khaki shirt in anticipation of the strain
The next instant he had al most gone over backwards taking the cube with him
MIS expression of stunned sur prise was so comical that laughed
Man you dont know your own strength told him
Here let me take it
He rose holding the cube easily under one arm
Believe it or not Wilder he said the things hol low
scoffed taking it from him while he climbed back be side me
But immediately realized that he had spoken the truth no solid could have been so weight less
If its hollow it must be box of some sort said and there must be way to open it
But careful examination first with the naked eye and then with powerful lens revealed not the slightest trace of latch keyhole or hinge
The six sides were as smooth as though they had been cast in one solid piece
Chatham was both excited and dis turbed
He shook his head
There was the beginning of awe in his eyes
One things clear at least he muttered
Its manmade
But made by what sort of man
Its too old for the stone age even if they pos sessed knowledge of metals in those days which they didnt
Why the rock this thing was embedded in must go back to the Pleistocene period
And that was just the beginning of the age of mammals said
We looked at each other and saw the inward sense of strangeness re flected in his eyes and knew that mine held the same reflection
We felt less elated even little subdued
Here was an object unquestionably made by human hands yet found embedded in rocks that had been formed ages before man himself had come into being
Chatham laughed nervously know what Im going to do he said with sudden determination
Im go ing to telegraph for old Gunthorp at the university
Hell be able to explain it if anybody can
got the odd impression that we were like children little frightened and therefore appealing to father for aid and advice
Professor Timothy Gunthorp was like ourselves an amateur archeolo gist but an exceptionally good one
His real work was in the physics department at one of Americas largest universities where he was working upon an experiment to con vert energy into matter thus reversing the usual process
We rode into town in my rattle trap car and sent off our wire at once
Before sundown we had re ceived an answer YOURE MISTAKEN
THERE AINT NO SUCH ANIMAL
WILL COME ON TOMORROW TO SEE IT
We felt better
We were clearing away our breakfast things the next morning when the familiar bald head THE BOX FROM THE STARS and steelrimmed spectacles of Pro fessor Gunthorp looked in at the open door of our shack
Youre fools both of you he an nounced with his customary abrupt ness
Tearing man away from im portant work with cockandbull story
Lets have look at this im possible marvel of yours
went over to our work table and removed the tarpaulin that we had thrown over the box
Gunthorp frowned disapprovingly
So you couldnt leave it where it was until got here he observed
Well you must have taken photo graphs of it in its original position at least
Feeling like utter simpletons we had to admit that in our excitement we had overlooked that bit of rou tine
Gunthorp clucked his tongue in annoyance
And you blockheads call yourselves archeologists he snorted
Only rank amateurs Professor Chatham said humbly
Gunthorp began to examine the box
First he lifted it to test its weight then he rapped upon it with his knuckles
Hollow as your two heads he vouchsafed
He bent closer and studied the metal
Looks like tung sten he observed
But it isnt
Either of you got any idea what it is
We both confessed that we had not
Well neither have he ad mitted sourly
Now take me out and show me where you found it
We conducted him to the spot and stood aside while he examined first the hole itself and then the sur rounding rocks
As his inspection progressed there grew upon his long lean face look of bepuzzle ment that afforded both Chatham and me secret satisfaction
Pres ently he picked up spade that we had neglected to take in the night before and with an energy surpris ing in man of his years began to clear away the rubble for about six feet on all sides of the hole
Of sudden he threw down the spade and whirled upon us
never before suspected either of you of possessing sense of humor he barked at us but in any case your socalled practical joke is rather thin
Practical joke
we gasped to gether
We were both accustomed to Gunthorps peppery outbursts but this did not sound like the usual thing
If theres practical joke Pro fessor its on us too declared
We found the box in that pocket yesterday precisely as we told you in our wire
If anybody put it there for little legpulling they did an unusually clever job for the rock stratum was closed above it
broke into it accidentally with my pick Chatham added
SOMETHING in cur words or at titudes must have convinced him for his manner underwent subtle change
queer unreadable expres sion crept into his eyes
Youve noticed suppose that this rock is not the same as the sur rounding rocks
he queried
We nodded
glacial boulder from the Riss or Wurm began but he interrupted me
Use your eyes Wilder use your eyes
This is no glacial boulder from the Wurm the Riss or any other glacier
Look at its pitted surface
Its fallen meteor
Even with my limited knowledge of meteorology realized all at once that he spoke the truth
The thought was dizzying
Millions of years ago this huge blob of mat ter had been drawn into the earths gravitational field and had become embedded in the still soft rocks
Probably it had originally been bu ried hundreds of feet deep and the gradual weathering and wearing down of the top strata through countless millenia had only within the past thousand or so years brought it near the surface near enough for our spades to strike
Chatham was staring at the gray pitted mass that the professors STRANGE STORIES spade had cleared
But but the box
he asked dazedly
Exactly Gunthorp repeated
The box
Without another word the three of us marched back to the shack for further examination of our myster ious find
But we learned no more than we already knew
Acid tests showed that it was composed of an alloy of tungsten and some other metal with which we were unfamiliar further proof if we had needed any that it was the work of intelligent beings
But that those beings could have been inhabitants of this earth was utterly impossible both because of the tremendous age of the rocks in which the box had been embedded and its unquestionable encasement in meteor
WILD thoughts flashed through my mind imaginings based on remembered legends of race be fore the time of Adam and of things that had supposedly drifted down from the stars
But did not men tion them to Gunthorp
He was striving desperately to keep matters on rational prosaic plane
Besides there was bound to be some less fan tastic explanation there had to be
What Id like to know Chatham remarked in the manner of one thinking aloud is what the thing was for
Why should it have been made hollow
Gunthorp looked up
Why not cut it open and find out
he asked
The suggestion seemed like good one and we agreed
Chatham brought out the large plate camera and took several pictures of the box from all angles then set to work upon it with cold chisel
We got our second shock
My greatest efforts produced not sin gle dent in the tough metal
Chatham and Gunthorp tried their hands but with no better success
Between us we turned the edges on four tools the box itself remained practically unscratched
Chatham ran his fingers through his red hair
Its lot tougher than ordinary tungsten he said Then he had an idea
Going over to the supply cupboard he brought back two phials one containing iron oxide the other powdered aluminum
If this doesnt do the trick well get an oxyacetylene torch he said
Not bad Gunthorp commented in what was for him extravagant praise
Of course theres chance of its marring the inside when it burns through but well have to run that risk
He took the two vials from Chat ham and blended their contents in thin careful line along the four edges of the boxs topmost plane
Then he lit it
There was sharp hiss as the pow ders ignited then it began to burn with brilliant greenish white flame
Wordlessly we watched that hol low square of fire keeping well back from the tremendous heat that it generated
Slowly it began to sink into the metal eating its way like an acid
In another minute or so it would be through and the top of the cube would drop inward
Gunthorp was standing by with pail of water which he meant to dash over it at the crucial moment
He had even taken step forward when without an instants warning the un expected happened
With final sputter the burning powder ate through the last thin bit of metal but instead of falling in the top of the box flew upward
There was rush of escaping force the word does not describe it prop erly but it is the nearest can find and we were hurled backwards into unconsciousness
We all regained our senses at about the same time and stared at one another in bewilderment What was it
An infernal machine
But knew better even as spoke
Had there been any kind of explo sion our frail shack would have been in ruins whereas not even the glass of the windows were broken
Gunthorp picked himself up and went over to the work table
Whatever it was its left no trace behind it he said jerkily
He held THE BOX FROM THE STARS up the cube still glowing redly around its seared edges
Its interior was as blank and uninformative as its exterior had been
It couldnt have been gas of any kind Chatham supplemented
gas powerful enough to knock us all out would have left some after effects
It was more like like He groped inadequately for words
Like great mental shock supplied trying to analyze my own feelings at the time
Thats it
Gunthorp rasped
The thing that was in that box paralyzed our minds temporarily
But its gone now he added with rueful shrug dissipated upon the air and thats the end of it
But for once Professor Timothy Gunthorp was wrong
CHAPTER II Missing Men TWO weeks drifted by
Gunthorp had returned to his research work at the university where in his spare time he was writing mono graph upon our mysterious discov ery and subsequent experience work which he told us frankly he had little hope that anyone would believe
Chatham and had gone back to our fossil hunting and al though we talked about the box often we felt that there was nothing more we could do about it
Then one day Chatham who had gone into town for supplies brought back strange story
There was be tween our camp and the town fair sized woods that formed veritable paradise for rabbit hunters during the game season
Since the season had just opened the day before swarm of them had descended upon it
And that was where Chathams story came in
It seemed that party of local men had started out early in the morning and had separated after reaching the woods according to custom
After hunting all day they met again at lodge that they kept to spend the night and they dis covered that one of their number man named Ed Stanton was missing
They waited for him until ten oclock then fearing that he might have met with an accident they set out in search of him
They searched with lanterns for half the night but found no trace of the missing man
Finally someone suggested that he might have gone home instead of returning to the lodge so they inquired there
But without result
Members of his fam ily and neighbors had then joined in the search which had continued throughout the night with the com ing of daylight Stanton was still missing
Looks bad commented when Chatham had finished his recital
That woods is large enough so that if he were badly hurt or killed he could lie there for days before being discovered
know it Chatham said
He glanced toward the forbidding dens ity of the woods scome half mile away
What do you say we join in the search
was willing and we set out to gether
The going was slow
It was nearly noon when we encountered three members of the original hunt ing party coming from the opposite direction
What luck
The oldest of the group shook his head
Not any he replied
Weve found plenty of fresh marks in the bushes but with the gang that was in here yesterday its impossible to tell whether any of them are Eds
It seems funny that he could have disappeared this way but of course weve got good bit of territory still to search
What about his dog
Chatham asked
Didnt he have dog
Thats another funny thing the other answered
The dogs gone too
However we found the dog or rather another party did around three oclock in the afternoon
It was lying under clump of laurel STRANGE STORIES bushes and it was dead with its tail drawn down between its legs and its eyes bulging
But there was not single mark of violence upon its body
Maybe it got hold of something that poisoned it one fellow sug gested as number of us gathered round
But the county sheriff who had now taken charge of the search shook his head
It wasnt any poison killed that dog he declared
Look at his eyes and tail
He was scared to death plumb scared
Id swear it
And damn it Im scared too
We redoubled our searching ef forts
We thrashed literally every foot of the underbrush within mile radius of the place where we had found the dog
We found no trace of Stanton
With the coming of night the sheriff called us all together
No use going on after dark he told us
These woods are too thick and we couldnt do thorough job
Better to wait until daylight and start in again
WOWEVER few searchers con JKL tinued on their own and in the morning one of them farm laborer named Jake Mills had somewhat weird story to relate
He and com panion had penetrated with lantern into the deepest part of the woods when of sudden they had become aware of strong sensation of being followed
We didnt hear nothin and we didnt see nothin Jake explained
It was just the way you feel when somebodys behind you starin with all his might at the back of your head
We turned around and sent the light of the lantern as far as it would go among the trees but there was nothin there
We even went back apiece but we couldnt find anything
Yet every time wed start on wed have that feelin of some thin behind us but not as close as it had been the first time
Finally it got on our nerves and so we de cided wed better take the sheriffs advice and wait till mornin
It was this story of Jakes that gave rise to the belief that an es caped lunatic with homicidal ten dencies might be hiding in the woods
But checkup of all the local and even more distant institu tions for the insane revealed that all their inmates were accounted for
number of the men began to laugh at what they called Jakes case of cold feet
Others remembered Stan tons dog and werent so free with their jibes
Nor were the others when four days later second man disappeared
He was Dr Philip Morse mem ber of Boston society for physical research
He had arrived at the local hotel shortly after Stantons disap pearance and advanced the theory that the missing man had fallen vic tim to some elemental or earth spirit that had been released in the woods
There was considerable amusement at his statement
But when he calmly announced his intention of camping alone in the woods in an attempt to contact the thing the amusement faded
Its not that hold with your ghost stories Dr Morse the sheriff told him but theres something in them woods thats snatched Ed Stan ton away bodily and scared the life out of his dog
man aint safe there alone
Dr Morse only smiled
That eve ning he pitched small tent near the place where Jake Mills and his companion had first felt they were being followed
Early the next morning the sher iff and two other men went out to check up on him
What gruesome horror they expected to discover they themselves did not know but they found the doctor calmly pre paring his breakfast after an un eventful night
The fact that he had spent one night alone in those supposedly sin ister woods without anything out of the ordinary befalling him lulled everyone into false sense of secur ity
Hence the discovery that was made the following day was doubly shocking
party of searchers coming upon the camp around noon of the second THE BOX FROM THE STARS day found it literally torn to pieces
As for Dr Morse himself he had disappeared as completely as Stanton had done five days before
Chatham and went to view the wreckage as soon as we heard about it
We found large crowd there looking about
Looks like cyclone hit the place one man remarked as we stopped beside him
The doc must have put up fearful fight
cyclone or lunatic another amended
One of them funny farms must be holdin out on us
But the tent was demolished the camp furniture bedding and even articles of clothing were torn to pieces in way that even the most desperate struggle could not properly account for
The sheriff came over to us
Well at least we know where Morse was when he was attacked he said
Ive sent to Philadelphia for bloodhounds when they come Im going to start out from here and see what they can find
We complimented him upon the plan
He nodded then with sig nificant glance and quick gesture im plied that he had something else to discuss with us in private
He mo tioned us aside
found this notebook under part of the tent he explained when we had drawn little away from the others
Morse must have been writ ing in it just before the thing got him
thought maybe you fellows would take look at it and tell me whether theres anything in it except just craziness
took the notebook from him and flipped open the top cover
Several pages were covered with cramped closely written shorthand almost un decipherable
It will take little while to figure this out said
May keep it until tomorrow morning
Sure he agreed readily
Keep it as long as you like just so you find out what it says
But was destined not to trans late personally more than the open ing pages of that manuscript for that evening the bloodhounds arrived
CHAPTER III The Cave AT THE sheriffs invitation we joined him and party of about dozen others on the manhunt
Darkness had already fallen when we assembled at the scene of Dr Morses demolished camp
In the flickering yellow light of lanterns the shadows of trees and bushes danced and writhed in grotesque contortions giving the scene an eeriness that un pleasantly affected all of us
little to one side stranger stood with the dogs two powerful black fellows who lolled passively at the ends of their chains as though they had no interest in what was going on
Presently the sheriff went over and held brief lowvoiced con versation with their owner then he addressed the rest of us
Mr Pattons gonna let the dogs go now he announced
He says we should stand back till theyve picked up the scent then we can follow as close as were able
If they start up any ruckus you fellas that have guns aint to use them unless you can see plain what youre shootin at
Youre liable to hit the dogs or the doc
The man called Patton was hold ing part of torn coat evidently Morses against the muzzle of first one dog then the other
When they had sniffed their fill he slipped the chains from their collars and with final indistinguishable command to them stepped back
Noses pressed to the ground the two animals began to run around the wreckage of the tent in gradually widening circles
Then with kind of nasal whine one of them suddenly darted off at tangent followed al most immediately by the other
With feeling of rising excite ment we started after them falling into rough single file to facilitate travel
We lost sight of the dogs almost from the beginning but we could hear them breaking through STRANGE STORIES the underbrush short distance ahead of us while they gave voice almost continuously to their deepthroated baying
For nearly mile we pushed on without anyone uttering word the silence around us broken only by the crackle of twigs and the baying of the dogs now farther distant
Then of sudden their baying gave place to excited yelping interspersed with highpitched whining noises
Theyve found him
the sheriff exclaimed and broke into run
KNOW practically nothing about bloodhounds but had pre monition the moment their tone changed that everything was not go ing according to schedule
No dog regardless of his breed ever indulges in that highpitched whine when everything is running entirely to his satisfaction
glanced at Patton and saw the same suspicion reflected on his face
By this time we had come out upon deep gully whose opposite wall was broken by the yawning black ness of caves mouth
The dogs had already crossed this gulley and were now yelping and whining in front of the cave
Gosh Almighty
He must be in there
the sheriff exclaimed and started scrambling down the steep side of the ravine
Whod have thought Equally puzzled the rest of us fol lowed
We all knew about the cave of course but no one had thought to search it because it was known to be the abode of bats and small but very disagreeable snakes
Ed Stanton would never have gone in there alive and he could not have got there dead
But Dr Morse now might be an other story Patton had forged on ahead of the rest of us and was standing over the dogs when we came up
lheyve got something cornered in there but they wont go in after it he announced
Ive never known them to act like this before
dont understand it
The sheriff went over and held up his lantern so that its light pene trated some ten or twelve feet into the cave
The dogs came straight here without seemin to lose the trail he commented so Morse must be inside
Shall we go in
Someone in the crowd offered an objection
Maybe theres wild ani mal in there
If the dogs wont go in But Patton scouted the suggestion
Theres no animal in this part of the country that these dogs are afraid of he declared
Still Ill admit theres something strange about the way theyre acting
He made final effort to induce the dogs to lead the way into the cave but without success
They only cowered upon their bellies and whined gazing pleadingly at him with their large intelligent eyes
Its no use he announced
Either well have to go in without them or we stay out
The sheriff gave hitch to his belt and stepped almost casually into the cave entrance
All right he drawled
All them that wants come along
Them that dont can wait where they are
There was momentary hesitancy on the part of few individuals but eventually everyone followed him into the dark opening
We advanced about fifty or sixty feet without making any sort of dis covery
few bats disturbed by the glare of our lanterns darted blindly about our heads but that was all
Then suddenly the sheriff stopped
Look he commanded and pointed downward
There in the thin sticky mould that covered the damp rock of the floor was human footprint
Instantly an excited babbling of speculation broke out among us
It was quite obvious that the footprint had been made within the past twentyfour hours since as yet none of the microscopic green algae plants had begun to form within it
There fore it had almost certainly been made by Dr Morse
Further searching revealed more footprints in fact two sets of them the one superimposed upon the other
From the presence of the algae in THE BOX FROM THE STARS the earlier set it was plain that it had been made at least several days before the second
It looks as if Morse and Stanton might both have come this way whispered to Chatham as we began to move forward again
He nodded
In the ruddy glow of the lanterns his face appeared wor ried
Thats what dont like about it Wilder he replied
What could have brought both of those men to this same cave and why did neither of them come out
It almost seems as if sudden startled shout from one of the men up ahead interrupted me
he was crying pointing trembling arm as he spoke
Look over there on that ledge
We all looked in the direction he indicated where ledge of rock ex cept for narrow crevice some two feet wide opening into unexploited blackness formed the back of the cave
Perched facing us upon this ledge and seeming to stare at us with unblinking lusterless eyes were two human figures
The sheriff took quick step for ward then almost dropped his lan tern
Merciful God
he gasped
Its Ed Stanton and Doctor Morse
So it was
The faces of the two men bore no marks of physical change or disfigurement yet in some subtle way they had altered so that at first glance we had been unable to recognize them
number of the men went over and lifted them down
Both bodies were limp and clammy but to our surprise they were not dead
Get them out of here and into the open the sheriff ordered
Maybe we can bring them around
Four men took up the inert bur dens and we started back the way we had come
Two of the younger fellows however lingered behind the others
wonder where that crack leads to heard one of them mutter to the other
Id like But was too interested in the condition of Morse and Stanton to pay any further attention
was to wish later that had
The two bodies were placed upon the ground at the entrance to the cave and the local doctor who for tunately was one of the party bent over them
cant make it out he reported after brief examination
It looks like catalepsy except that theres no rigidity
Wed better get them to hospital at once
While crude stretchers were being improvised from coats Chatham drew me aside
Wilder did you ever see Cre tin
he asked lowering his voice so that none of the others might over hear
No answered wondering why he should bring up such subject at this time cant say that have
Well have he went on and except for the physical deformation that accompanies cretinism the faces have the same blank mindless look that these two have
But what never finished my question
From the interior of the cave arose sudden wild shriek of terror followed by hideous mouth ing and gibbering that was distinctly not human
remembered the two men who had lingered behind
SNATCHING lantern dashed for the mouth of the cave fol lowed closely by Chatham and one or two others
It took me almost no time at all to reach the place where we had found Morse and Stanton but in those few minutes the sounds that had sum moned us had subsided into low jabbering like the chattering of monkey
And they were coming from beyond the crevice at the back of the cave
Holding the lantern high above my head started toward the narrow opening
But before could reach it man staggered out and all but col lapsed in my arms
He was Jim Lentz one of the two who had re mained behind
Something in there he muttered thickly
Got Hellman no use
going in
too late
STRANGE STORIES Then he fainted
do not lay any claims to bravery for actually pressing on into that dark passageway
It was the sheer excitement of the moment that drove me leaving no room for fear
Still holding the lantern in front of me sidled along the crevice for about six feet
Abruptly found myself in another cave
It was much smaller than the first so that the light of the lantern pene trated into practically all of it at once
As the ruddy rays sent the black shadows scuttling back among the uneven prominences and fissures that marked the walls and ceiling experienced curious sensation which am wholly unable to describe
Al though realize how ridiculous the words may sound can say only that it was as though some over powering force had collided with my mind
The impression was only momen tary and was gone with the retreat ing shadows
But instantly second shock this time wholly explicable took its place
For groveling upon the middle of the rock floor and mouthing horribly like some mad animal was the figure of Hellman
heard an exclamation behind me and realized that Chatham had fol lowed me through the narrow pass age
Merciful God
he choked
Hes gone mad
ground between clenched teeth
We must get him out of here
set the lantern upon projecting rock and Chatham and flung our selves upon Hellman
He had paid no attention to us until he felt our hands upon him then he began to fight with the strength of maniac
In the end we were forced to knock him unconscious before we were able to drag him from the cave
When he came to he was still in that savage bestial state he had to be taken to an asylum
TEXT day we heard Lentzs story Xl of what had taken place
set it down here as nearly as can in his own words We were about to leave the cave with the rest of you he told group of us when Hellman sug gested that we stay and see where that little opening at the back led to
wasnt so keen about it but when he laughed and said was afraid gave in
He had the lantern and so he went first while followed close be hind
The passage was so narrow that we had to go sideways and the first thing knew my coat had caught on sharp rock so that had to stop to get it loose
Hellman must have thought that wasnt coming for he made grab for me
As he did that he somehow dropped the lantern and it went out
He paused and passed trembling hand over his face
It was plain that what he had to relate filled him with almost unendurable horror
Its hard to explain what happened next he went on after minute for dont exactly know myself
All of sudden he let go of me and staggered backwards
Then he let out the most awful yell Ive ever heard
At first thought hed fallen into pit or something and called out to him to ask what was wrong
He didnt answer me with words but he began to make those awful noises like like an animal or something
There were sounds of thrashing about too but they werent so much like two men or even man and an animal struggling together as like one man fighting with himself
tried to go to help him but all of sudden couldnt move
It was as if everything Id ever been afraid of without giving name to it had taken form in there
If any of you fellows were ever scared of the dark when you were kids youll know what mean
It was like that only hundred times worse
And all the time Hellman kept making those terrible noises not so loud as at first but more and more like an animal
Then heard somebody coming and managed to get out to them
guess thats all know
That afternoon the sheriff and sev eral others searched both parts of the cave with powerful electric THE BOX FROM THE STARS torches
They found absolutely noth ing but the sheriff in telling us about it afterwards concluded with strange statement
was the last one to leave the inner cave he said and just as stepped into that narrow passage that connects the two funny thing happened
All of sudden had the same feeling that Jake Mills had had in the woods the night after Ed Stanton disappeared the feeling of something staring at the back of my head
It fairly made the chills go over me for knew there wasnt living thing back there
Ive notion to ask the county commissioners either to have that place sealed up or better yet dynamited
CHAPTER IV The Gunthorp Theory ITH the finding of Stanton and Dr Morse and the insan ity of Hellman the newspapers which had hitherto given the disap pearances only passing notice now broke out with headlines
Naturally this resulted in an army of curiosity seekers who had to be kept away from the cave by an armed guard but it was also indirectly responsible for bringing about the solution to the whole mysterious affair for it brought back Prof Gunthorp
He presented himself unannounced at our shack sarcastic and snappy as ever
Well see youve done nothing toward clearing this mess up he an nounced abruptly so came my self
Chatham made some illadvised re mark about not seeing how the hap penings at the cave could come under the province of archeology
The pro fessor shot him withering glance
You wouldnt he snapped
suppose you and Wilder are ready to subscribe to Morses ghost theory
Still he added as if on second thought that man may have been nearer to the right track than he realized
shame he didnt make any sort of notes before the thing got him
But he did
exclaimed sud denly remembering the notebook that had promised the sheriff to trans late
Here they are
He fairly pounced upon the little book
You blithering idiots
he cried
If you had examined this that last poor devil Hellman might not have been sacrificed
Now get out while see what Morse had to say
All the rest of that morning he was occupied with laboriously trans cribing Dr Morses cramped short hand
By the middle of the after noon he had completed the task and was ready to share what he had learned with Chatham and me
Well skip over the first few pages he announced since they consist of nothing but Morses idiotic theories
Funny how an otherwise sane man will cling to worn out superstitions when he can find wholly satisfactory explanation of the facts in the laws of higher phys ics
But let that go you probably wouldnt understand it anyway
He leafed jerkily over one or two more pages
This next is an hourly record of his first nights vigil he continued and consists mainly of the words Nothing so far so we can skip that too
But here is his record of the second night up to the point where he was attacked
He cleared his throat and began to read aloud Eight It is fairly dark now so will begin my record for to night although really cannot hope for any genuine phenomenon for some hours yet
Still for the sake of science it is best to be on the safe side
The woods are very still but no more so than they should be ordi narily
Again shall endeavor to work without light since light of any kind seems to be antagonistic to psychic forces
Nine Nothing yet
The trees and bushes on all sides are loud with the voices of night insects
It seems almost impossible that such STRANGE STORIES tiny creatures can make so much noise
am beginning to believe that the true intensity of sound is to be measured only by the intensity of the silence that surrounds it
Ten Either some of the insects have gone to sleep or am growing accustomed to their minia ture racket
probably did not notice this last night because was still too new at this type of vigil
am making this entry half hour earlier because believe that soon will have some sort of success
The insects are nearly all quiet now circumstance which am positive did not occur last night
But it is not merely this cessation of ordinary night noises that leads me to believe am about to experience some kind of psychic phenomenon
There is decided feel ing of tension in the air such as is noticeable just prior to severe elec trical storm yet the sky wherever it is visible through the trees is en tirely cloudless and rny little barom eter which examined moment ago with my flashlight shows no in dication of falling weather
Ten fortyfive
was right
force of some sort is gathering out side my tent
As the man Mills described can feel eyes upon me but they are not human eyes
will make ray mind receptive to whatever may be coming
Eleven It is here in the tent with me and must fight it off
My God
It is horrible
can neither see it nor hear it and yet it has taken hold of me
If the cold arm of an octopus could reach into my mind it would be like that
It is too strong for me
Gunthorp looked up from the note book
The writing breaks off here in meaningless scrawl he said
The Power must have overcome him
CHATHAM and had been listen ing openmouthed
But what power
asked incredulously
If it was something he could neither see nor hear nor apparently even feel tangibly what was it
Gunthorp shot me an enigmatic glance through his thicklensed spec tacles
Hasnt it dawned upon you even now
he asked
But Chatham was leaning forward his red hair bristling with excite ment
Professor he exclaimed
That day we opened the box the feeling of mental shock
The professors bald head nodded
The box
He paused to enjoy the little dra matic moment he had created then he went on It was theory of the early phys icists and pseudophysicsts Paracel sus in particular that atoms were of two classes the heavier and inert composing matter the lighter and more active composing mind
Of course such an idea went into the discard even before the subdivi sions of the atom were discovered but it is my belief that Paracelsus came nearer to the truth than even he realized
If as Millikan suggests all mat ter is merely form of energy and my own experiments tend to bear this out then it is quite possible that the thing which we call mind or mental force is form of this energy
Whether the process of thought is its ordered releasing through the material chemistry of the brain or whether it is an independent quantity that acts through the brain need not concern us now
The important point is that such quantity should be able to exist in the free state the same as any other of the known ele ments
If am right then some sort of entity made up of this pure energy was imprisoned in the box which you found embedded in the meteor
Dont ask me how or by whom for those are questions beyond our power to answer
But when the box was opened this force was released to go about preying upon other mental forces just as we feed our material bodies with other material bodies
Do you follow me
We did after fashion although the idea behind his words seemed al most too fantastic for credence
Chatham was running his fingers through his hair as if to aid in as THE BOX FROM THE STARS similating the professors startling statement
But it isnt logical
he finally burst out
If the thing feeds upon mental power how did it manage to keep alive during all those hundreds of thousands of years that it was im prisoned in the box
Perhaps feeds is an illchosen word Gunthorp admitted
The en tity if we can call it such could exist indefinitely without nourish ment because it is composed of pure force and force is indestructible
It may be more accurate to liken it to large blob of mercury which when liberated will draw smaller globules into itself
We considered this in silence then But if this thing remains at large it will go about attacking others as it attacked Stanton and Morse and later Hellman
exclaimed in hor ror
Why if it isnt stopped it isnt beyond the bounds of possibility that it will eventually absorb into itself all the mental power of the world
Is there no way to stop it or destroy it
Destroy it no Gunthorp an swered gravely
However it is pos sible that we may be able to trans mute it so that it will be rendered harmless and that is what we must try to do
It has long been tenet of phys ics that force or energy is produced by the destruction of matter
In other words matter which is made up of minute particles may be changed into energy which is of wave composition
But recent experi ment with light for example have shown that it possesses the character istics of both particles and waves
This leads to the conclusion that the two are but different forms of the same thing and therefore inter changeable
But what has all that to do Chatham began but the professor cut him short
Think the old mans raving again do you
he snapped
Well hes not
What Im getting at if you had the brains to see it is that its as logical to convert energy into matter as it is to convert matter into en ergy
Your energy transformer
ex claimed remembering his work at the University and suddenly seeing the light
Exactly he replied
Of course cant guarantee that the thing will work satisfactorily since its still largely in the experimental stage
But at least we can try
If it fails He shrugged
Well we will have to think of something else
CHAPTER The Reversal of Nature THAT evening Gunthorp sent off long wire to his assistant or dering the shipment of several pieces of apparatus from his laboratory
Two days later the equipment ar rived whole truckload of it
Gun thorp did not unpack it but directed his assistant who had brought it per sonally to drive it down to the mouth of the cave
Well have to carry it piece by piece into the outer cave and set it up there he announced
Id prefer to have it in the inner cave but it would be impossible to get it through that narrow passage
The best we can do is coax the entity out to us
But how
asked practically
You leave that to me was his only answer
It took us the better part of week to set the machinery up to his satisfaction
During all of our opera tions we kept the cave brightly lighted with number of kerosene lamps for as Gunthorp pointed out the thing we were fighting struck only in darkness indicating that there was some property in light that drove it off
But even with the protection of the lamps it was eerie enough working in that ghostly bat hung cavern knowing that just be yond the narrow passage in the inner chamber something lurked in wait STRANGE STORIES something that fed upon mens minds
will not attempt to describe the energy transformer other than to say that it bore rough resemblance to those elaborate mechanisms used in experiments to smash the atom but built on much smaller scale
It worked Gunthorp explained by changing the lengthwise undulation of energy waves to sidewise or cross vibration which would bring about the transformation of pure energy into free atoms
When at last everything was in readiness Gunthorp gave Chatham and me our final instructions
want you both to listen care fully and to do
exactly as tell you he began
His usual fussy bumptiousness was gone now and he seemed unnaturally grave
When we go into the cave we will extin guish all the lanterns
Otherwise the thing will not come out where we are
Then you Wilder will start the generator while go to the entrance of the narrow passage that leads to the inner cave
But Professor broke in do you realize what that means
Youll be placing yourself in the position of human decoy to that monstrosity
Yes yes know he snapped with momentary return of his old irritability
But the thing must be lured out somehow and thats the only way can think of
However there will be little danger if Chat ham does precisely what tell him
What do you want me to do
Chatham asked little uneasily
want you to stand by the pro jector Gunthorp explained
As soon as you hear me utter sound either an intelligible word or other wise you will release the trans former beam
Leave it on for five minutes
If at the end of that time have not returned to shut it off you must both get out of the cave as fast as you can
And leave you there
Chatham exclaimed
Not if Be quiet you young idiot Gun thorp interrupted testily
Youll do as tell you
know what Im about
His tone precluded further argu ment
We followed him obediently into the cave
One after another the lanterns were extinguished until only one re mained
Chatham held it until Gun thorp had taken up his position at the entrance to the passage then it too was put out For what seemed an eternity we stood there in the darkness waiting
Somewhere in that darkness we knew malignant entity lurked something that fed upon mens minds and cast aside their bodies like dis carded husks
To my overexcited imagination it seemed that this in visible horror was creeping up on me from all sides at once and felt myself shrinking as if from physi cal contact
Abruptly Gunthorps voice came to us out of the blackness Now
he hissed
Release the ray
With feeling of relief that the suspense of waiting was over and definite action about to begin heard Chatham throw the switch
The next instant HOW shall ever describe what followed
There was no flash for the condenser ray was invisible nor was there any sound other than the steady hum of the generator
But suddenly the air around us became charged with the straining tension of mighty struggle
force that was intelligent but not tangible had been caught in the grip of manmade force against which it was now fight ing for its life
For nearly four minutes by the radium dial of my wrist watch the battle raged seeming all the more terrible because it was not physical
The air seemed to boil and swell like water churned up by the thrash ing of seaserpent in its death agony
And then at last when it seemed that we ourselves must be crushed by the mighty force of the conflict something snapped
Of sudden the tension was dissipated while the re lieved atmosphere appeared to col lapse like the sides of balloon from THE BOX FROM THE STARS which the straining gases have been released
The struggle was over
Someone was groping toward the projector
It was Gunthorp recog nized his voice as he stumbled over some piece of apparatus in the dark ness
Professor are you all right
called anxiously
Of course Im all right came his tart reply
Cant one of you idiots make light before break my neck
Here let me Chatham offered
He struck match
There was burst of flame accom panied by terrific explosion
The walls of the cave rocked around us and rocks and dirt were rained down upon us
One large sized rock struck me upon the head When regained consciousness was lying upon my bunk back in Chathams and my shack
Gunthorp was bending over me
For the first time since had known him sur prised an expression almost of ten derness in his eyes
Are you all right boy
he asked
How do you feel
Oh guess Ill live grinned trying to ignore the pain in my head
Tell me what happened
It was all my fault Chatham put in
That match struck It was my fault for being an old fool Gunthorp cut him short
should have known better than to have used the converter without test ing its strength first
You see he explained the ray was much stronger than had antic pated
Thus instead of converting the energy entity into free electrons it condensed it into hydrogen atoms the lowest step in the atomic scale
Then when at my direction Chat ham struck match He made an expressive gesture
The highly inflammable nature of hydrogen did the rest Chatham fin ished
It took the roof off the cave just above where you were standing and dropped piece of it down on your head
With start sat up unmindful of the dizzying throbbing in my head
Good Lord
cried in alarm
If the thing was converted into hy drogen and the hydrogen exploded then it was turned back into energy again
know Gunthorp nodded
But this time it was scattered by the force of the explosion and can do no damage
Or at least he added grimly so hope
And so far it seems that he is right
It is more than probable that the entity torn apart by the explo sion was rendered utterly powerless
Or if it was not it apparently prof ited by its bitter experiences in the world of men and fled back to the distant stars from which it came orig inally
But that is something suppose we shall never know
God keep us from such things
We need more mind in the world not less

HE WAS found in the room cure written confession
Perhaps with his wife slightly con the Police Department felt it was fused trifle bewildered too plain case
At least it was but otherwise apparently normal
He handled intelligently and in most made no effort to conceal his con scientific manner
The man was well duct any more than he did to the knife fed carefully bedded and the next in his hand or the pieces in the morning after being bathed and trunk
shaved was taken to see psychi Fortunately the inspector was an atrist
officer of more than usual intelli The specialist in mental diseases gence and there was no effort made had the man comfortably seated to give the third degree or even se Knowing he smoked he offered THE DEAD WOMAN cigar which was accepted
Then in quiet pleasant atmosphere he made one statement and one request
am sure Mr Thompson that you had an excellent reason for act ing as you did the other day
wish you would tell me all about it
THE man gazed at the psychiatrist
Will you believe me if tell you
will accept every part of your story with the idea that you are con vinced that you are telling me the truth
That is all want whispered Thompson
If everyone talked to in the past had done that if they had even tried to check up on my story perhaps this would not have happened
But they always thought that was the sick one and there was not one who was willing to ac cept my statement about the worms
suppose that was happily mar ried
At least as much so as most men are
You know that there is good deal of conflict between the sexes and there were few differ ences of opinion between Mrs Thompson and myself
But not enough to cause serious difficulty
Will you remember that
That we did not quarrel very much
About year ago my wifes health began to give me considerable cause for worry
She started to fail
If you are married man Doctor you know there is always that anxiety about the wifes health
You become ac customed to living with woman having her do things for you go to places with you and you think about how life would be if she should sicken and die
Perhaps the fact that you are uneasy about the future makes you exaggerate the importance of her symptoms
At any rate she became sick de veloped nasty cough and lost weight
spoke to her about it and even bought bottle of beef wine and iron at the drug store and made her take it
She did so to please me but she never would admit that she was sick
Said it was fashionable to be thin and that the cough was just nervousness
She would not go to see doctor
When spoke to her mother about it the old lady just laughed at me said that if tried to make Lizzie little happier she would soon get fat
In fact none of our family or our friends seemed to feel that there was anything wrong with Mrs Thomp son so stopped talking about it
Of course it was not easy on me the way she coughed at night and her staying awake so much
work hard in the daytime and it is hard to lose lot of sleep
At last was forced to ask her to let me sleep in the spare bedroom
Even that did not help much
could hear her cough and when she did fall asleep would have to tip toe into her room and see if she was all right
Her coughing bothered me so much that when she did not cough it worried me more because thought something had happened to her
One night the thing was afraid of happened
She had hard spell of coughing and then she stopped
It was quiet in the house
could hear the clock on the landing tick and mouse gnawing wood in the attic
thought could even hear my own heart beat but there was not sound of any kind from the other bedroom
When went in there and turned on the light just knew it was all over
Of course was not sure
bookkeeper is not supposed to be an expert in such matters so went and telephoned for our doctor
On the way to the phone wondered just what should say for he had always insisted that my wife was in grand health
So simply told him that Mrs Thompson was not looking well and would he come over
Just like that told him and tried to keep my voice steady
It was about an hour before he came
He went into the bedroom but stopped at the doorway
He spent sometime listening to her heart and feeling her pulse and then he straightened up and said to me She is fine
Just fast asleep
wish could sleep as soundly as that
What did you think was wrong
That surprised me so much that all could do was to stammer some STRANGE STORIES thing about not hearing her cough any more
He laughed
You worry too much about her Mr
Right there my difficulty started
Here was doctor who was supposed to know his business and he said there was nothing wrong with my wife and there was just book keeper and just knew what was the matter
What was to do
Tell him that he was wrong
Send for another physician
It was growing light by that time so went down to the kitchen and started the coffee
often did that
Then shaved and made ready to go to the office
But before went sat down while by the wifes bed
It bothered me but had to keep telling myself that the doctor knew better than did
MEFORE leaving the house MM phoned to my motherinlaw
Just told her that Lizzie was not feel ing well and would she come over and spend the day and she could get me at the office any time she called
Then left the house
It felt better out in the sunshine and after work ing few hours over the books al most laughed at myself for being so foolish
No telephone calls from the old lady
arrived home at six and found the house lighted as usual
My wife and motherinlaw were waiting for me in the parlor and told me supper was ready
Naturally was surprised to see my wife out of bed
At the supper table watched her just as carefully as could without making the two of them suspicious of me
Mrs Thompson ate about as she usually did just pieced and minced at her food but thought when she swallowed that the food went down with jerk and there was stiffness when she moved
But her mother did not seem to think there was anything wrong at least she did not make any comment
Even when went with her to the front door to say good night to her and we were alone there she never said word to show that she thought her daughter was peculiar
started to wash the dishes after that
often washed the dishes at night while the wife sat in the front parlor watching the people go up and down past the house
After the kitchen was tidy lit cigar and went into the parlor and started little conversation but Mrs Thomp son never talked back
In fact do not believe she ever talked to me after that though am positive that she talked to the others
When the cigar was smoked just said good night and went to bed
Later could hear her moving around in her room and then all was quiet so she must have gone to bed
She did not cough any more
congrat ulated myself on that one thing be cause the coughing had kept me awake good deal
During the night lit candle and shading it with my hand tip toed in to see her
She had her eyes open but they were rolled back so all you could see was the whites and she was not breathing
At least could not tell that she was breath ing and when held mirror in front of her mouth there was no vapor on it
My mother had told me the purpose of that when was boy
The next day was just the same
My motherinlaw came and spent the day
came home at night and ate supper with them and washed the dishes
The water was hot and it was pleasure to make them clean
Perhaps took longer than usual at it because did not fancy the idea of going into the front parlor where the wife was sitting looking out of the window
But went in tonight without the usual cigar
wanted to use my nose
It seemed there was peculiar odor in the house like flowers that had been put in vase of water and then forgotten for many days
Per haps you know the odor Doctor heavy one like lilies of the valley in small closed room
It was specially strong in the parlor where Mrs Thompson was sitting and it seemed to come from her
had to light the cigar after while and by and by said good night and went to bed
She THE DEAD WOMAN never spoke to me in fact she did not seem to pay any attention to me
About two that morning took the candle and went in to look at her
Her eyelids were open and her eyeballs were rolled back just like they had been the night before but now her jaw was dropped and her cheeks sunk in
just could not do anything but telephone for doctor and this time picked out total stranger just picked his name out of the telephone book haphazard
What good did it do
None at all
He came he examined Mrs Thompson very carefully and he simply said that he did not see any thing wrong with her and then down in the front hall he turned on me and asked me just why had sent for him and what thought was the matter with her
Of course just could not tell him the truth with his being doctor and being just bookkeeper
MBY motherinlaw went to the YM
mountains next day for the summer and that left us alone
Break fast as usual and to the office and not word all day from the house
When came back at night the house was lit and supper was on the table and the wife at her end as usual and the food served and on the plates
She ate but her movements were slower and when she swallowed you could see the food go down by jerks and her eyes were sunken into the sockets and seemed shiny and well like the eyes of fish on the stalls
There were flowers on the table but the smell was something differ ent it was sweeter and when took deep breath it was just hard for me to go on eating the pork chops and potatoes
You see it was summer time and warm and in spite of the screens there was fly or two in the house and when saw one walking around on her lip and she not mak ing any effort to brush it off just couldnt keep on eating
Had to go and start washing the dishes
Per haps you can understand how felt Doctor
Things looked rather odd
The next day phoned to the office that would not be there and sent for taxi and took Mrs Thompson to first class specialist
He must have been good because he charged me twentyfive dollars just for the office call
went in first and told him just exactly what was afraid of and did not mince my words and then we had the wife in
He examined her even her blood and all the satisfaction got was that she seemed trifle anaemic but that had better take nerve tonic and vacation or would be sick
Things looked rather twisted after that
Either was right and every body else wrong or they were right and was just about as wrong men tally as man could be
But had to believe my senses
man just has to believe what he sees and hears and feels and when thought over that office visit and the wife smiling and the doctor sticking her finger for the blood to examine it just seemed im possible
Why that was simple word to describe her con dition
That night the flies were worse than usual
went to the corner store and bought fly spray and used it in her bedroom but they kept coming in the big blue ones you know
Seemed as though they just had to come in and could not keep them off her face so at last in des peration covered her head up with towel and went to sleep
had to work the interest on the mortgage was due and the man wanted some thing on the principal and it was good house and all had in the world to show for twenty years of hard work keeping books
The next day was just like all the days had been except that made more mistakes with the books and my boss spoke to me about it
And when arrived home supper was not ready though Mrs Thompson was in the parlor and the lights on
The heavy odor was worse than usual and there were lot of flies
You could hear them buzz and strike against the electric lights
got my own supper but couldnt eat much thinking of her in the parlor and the flies settling on her open mouth
STRANGE STORIES She just sat there that night in the parlor till went to her and took her arm to lead her up the stairs
She was cold and on each cheek there was heavy purple blotch forming
Once she was in her room she seemed to move around so left her alone and when went into her room later on she was in bed
It had been hard week for me so sat down by her bed and tried to think but the more thought the worse things seemed
The night was hot and the flies kept buzzing just thinking of the past and how we used to go to the movies together and laugh and sometimes come near cry ing and how we used to bluff about the fact that perhaps it was just as well we didnt have child so long as we had each other knowing all the time that she was eating her heart out for longing to be mother and blaming me for her loneliness
The thinking was too much for me so thought might as well smoke another cigar and go to bed and try to keep better books the next day and hold my job and then saw the little worm crawl out
Right then and there knew that something had to be done
It didnt make any difference what the doctors or her mother said something had to be done and was the one who had to do it
telephoned for an undertaker
Met him downstairs
Tt will be private funeral told him and no publicity and think after you are through you will have no trouble obtaining physi cians certificate
He went up stairs
In about five minutes he came down stairs
must have gone to the wrong room he said
The second story front bedroom replied
But the woman there is not dead he said
paid him for his trouble and shut the door in his face
Was helpless
Doctor you have to be lieve me
was at the end of my rope
had tried every way knew and there was not anything left to do
No one believed me
No one agreed with me
It seemed more and more as though they thought was insane
WWT WAS impossible to keep her in the house longer
My health was giving way
Woricmg all day at figures that were going wrong all the time and coming back night after night cooking my supper and sleep ing in room next to the thing that had been my wife
What with the smell of lilies of the valley and the buzz of flies and the constant dread in my mind of how things would be the next day and the next week and the mortgage due
had to do some thing
And it seemed to me that she wanted me to
It seemed that she recognized that things were not right that she was entitled to dif ferent kind of an ending
tried to put myself in her place and knew what would want done with me if things were reversed
So brought the trunk up from the cellar
We had used that trunk on our wedding trip and every sum mer since on our vacations and thought that she would be more at peace in that trunk than in new one
But when had the trunk by her bed saw at once that it was too small unless used knife
That seemed to be the proper thing to do and was sure that it would not hurt her
For days she had been past hurting
told her was sorry but it just had to be done and if people had just believed me things could have been arranged in nicer way
Then started
Things were confused after that
seem to remember scream and blood spurting and the next thing there were lot of people in the house and they arrested me
And that is the peculiar part of it all Doctor
Perhaps you do not know it but am accused of murder ing my wife
Now have told you all about it Doctor and just want to ask you one question
If you had been in my place day after day and night after night what would you have done Doctor
What would any man have done who loved his wife
The Vengeance of Ai The Ancient Goddess of the Chaldeans Stilt Exacts Tribute in the Valley of the Moon
By MARK SCHORER Author of Portrait of Ladies etc
Do you see them running running WHEN Margaret Levering left me in London she said There is something that cant wait out there Peter
knew that whatever she implied had to do with her father then four months dead but Margaret would tell me nothing more
She went on to Cairo alone as she wished
But when six weeks parsed with only the brief and strained notes from her knew something was wrong and followed her
At the Hotel Continental in Cairo late one afternoon in October had barely finished bathing when boy appeared with sealed note for me although had informed no one of my arrival
ripped it open and read Dear Mr Harris understand you have just come from London and assume you are led here by your interest in the welfare of Margaret Levering the now Lady Warrender who STRANGE STORIES is in Cairo at the Hotel Memphis and who has more than once spoken of you
Please be so good as not to refer in any way to her father the late Lord Warrender nor to his recent excavations and unfortunate death in the Valley of the Moon
should be glad to talk this unusual request over with you as between mutual friends of Lady Warrender if you should so desire
May respectfully urge you to see me before you see Lady Warrender
You will find me in Room of this hotel
Ask for Ernest Lumsden
Ernest Lumsden
had never heard of him Be so good as not to refer in any way to her father he had written
Why not
Margaret was perfectly aware of her fathers excavations and knew almost as much of arche ology anthropology and Egyptology as he had known himself
Why make no mention of something that had been headlined in every newspaper and journal in the English speaking world
Lord Warrender had been crushed to death by falling statue in the templetomb of Ai Goddess of the Moon
remembered again in my hotel room how bravely Margaret had taken his death
They were adventurers those two and the true adventurer is always ready to meet what Provi dence may have in store for him
knocked loudly at number
The door opened almost immediately and found myself confronted by an elderly gentleman whose not unkind face was lined with wrinkles
His hair was sparse and white yet he could not have been much over fifty
May see Mr
in quired
am Mr Lumsden
Come in
Thank you
walked past him into the room
When he had closed the door again he turned to me
Peter Har ris
he asked
nodded curtly
It was good of you to come
He turned slightly and indicated youngish man whom had not no ticed before
Allow me to present the Sheikh AlJubal Mr Peter Har ris
The Egyptian wore white drill suit and carried cane except for the turban binding his swarthy head he might easily have been mis taken for an Englishman browned by the hot African sun
The Sheikh Al Jubal bowed
TURNED to Lumsden again
confess that found your note surprising said
May know its meaning
Lord Warrender was my best friend Lumsden began quietly his eyes steadily on me
Had so much as set foot in London in the past twenty years you would no doubt have known of me before this
As dear friend of her late father am naturally interested in Lady War render
The Sheikh AlJubal he went on indicating once more the silent Egyptian also knew her father well
His intimate acquaintance with the history and present state of the Valley of the Moon proved invalu able to Lord Warrender in his work here
During an acquaintance that was at first matter of convenience these two came to regard each other with deep respect and friendship
He paused
hope you can see Harris that in us you have two friends interested only in Lady Warrenders welfare
The old mans manner and speech convinced me of his integrity
appreciate that said
Good he said nodding abruptly
Do you know the history of the tombs in the Valley of the Moon
he asked
Im afraid dont
My knowledge of Egyptology is practically nil and in these more unusual matters con fess know nothing at all
Lumsden turned to the Sheikh
Tell him AlJubal
The Sheikh addressed me for the first time since our introduction
looked at this dark man with the heavy black beard the beetling brows the thin lips
He spoke in low pleasant voice
Ai the Moon Goddess is not THE VENGEANCE OF AI Egyptian yet she is the goddess of that accursed valley worshiped and revered by many of our natives even today
He paused as if searching for point at which to begin and pres ently went on
Long years ago wealthy Chal dean merchant left his native land for Egypt
He came personally to barter his finest wares with Egypts princes and his stay was climaxed by his fortunate marriage to an Egyp tian lady of quality
The family founded by that mar riage was one of the richest and most influential during that whole period and the wealthy merchant found Egypt so to his liking that he made his home here as many others have done since
When he died the question of burial arose
Despite his family and his impor tance he was not Egyptian
He de sired burial under the protection of his own gods
So tomb was built in what has since been called the Valley of the Moon
There his mummy was laid
And though he was the only for eigner in that resting place Ai Chaldean Goddess of the Moon con tinued as the protecting deity of the valley and of the people buried there
In the innermost chamber of that first tomb in the valley there is colossal statue of Ai
Around her neck is suspended giant pectoral of gold an eightraed disk symbol of the divine power of Ai
These facts were brought to light by Lord Warrender
His labor had brought him to this inner chamber and it was there that his work was so un fortunately cut short
The Egyptian ceased abruptly and settled back
Was it that statue that crushed him
Lumsden nodded
Yes it was the great statue of Ai that toppled from its base and killed Lord Warrender in its fall
The accident occurred when he attempted to remove the golden amulet from the neck of the colossus
Isnt it odd that statue of that size should topple
No one thought of that until the Sheikh and got to looking into the matter said Lumsden
Lord War render had spoken of the statue to us pointing out that it was attached very firmly to its base
So firmly indeed that he made much of the fact that it would be extremely diffi cult to do anything with it
Yet the next day it fell crushing him
Could Lord Warrender have been deceived
Perhaps it only seemed firmly attached
LUMSDEN shrugged his shoulders but the look on his face showed his scorn for my suggestion that Lord Warrender might have been in error
Perhaps you will think that we too were deceived when the Sheikh and found the statue of Ai re stored to its base when we visited the tomb after Warrenders burial
Before could reply the Sheikh AlJubal cut in suddenly There were other things
Do not forget them Lumsden
Mr Harris perhaps thinks that worshiping natives crept into the templetomb at night and righted the statue
Lumsden spread his hands
Yes he said perhaps he does
As mat ter of fact that was exactly what had been thinking
But Lumsden went on Id almost forgotten there were other things
The terror of the natives when they saw the statue of Ai and the eightrayed moondisk and their sub sequent flight
They were afraid of something screamed out something about curse and went positively frantic when Lord Warrender sug gested removing the amulet from about the neck of the statue
When Lord Warrender went down into the crypt to take the amulet only two white aides were with him
The natives would not go near the tomb nor can any of them be induced to enter the tomb even now
Only the two white men saw the statue topple and fall just as Lord Warrender was about to remove the golden disk and since then one of those two men has STRANGE STORIES died mysterious and unaccountable death
What are you implying
The Sheikh AlJubal interposed
It is not time to beat about the bush he said
The matter is clear for those who wish to see
The desecrator of Ais templetomb is cursed nothing can save him from death
smiled halfheartedly with an in solent superiority which did not quite feel
Am expected to take this seriously
AlJubal frowned impatiently and Lumsden looked irritated
Then the Sheikh spoke again with scornful gesture in my direction
Perhaps Mr Harris will consider more seriously the as yet unexplained death of Lord Warrenders successor Herbert Lanseer
He was found just outside the templetomb of Ai
He seemed to have been beaten or crushed to death
There were strange marks tiie marks of the guardians of Ai those invisible spirits who have been set to guard the Valley of the Moon and those sleeping there
AGAIN felt uneasy
If it was this sort of nonsense
Well what has all this got to do with Lady Warrender
Everything in the world said Lumsden quietly
Lady Warrender is somewhat less skeptical than you
was astounded Do you mean to say that Margaret scientist that she is actually believes her father to have been killed by the vengeance of Ai and that other man Lanseer think you called him
Lumsden looked away sighing gently
Yes he said she believes that and more
She believes much more
There is another native belief which might interest you
And that
asked finding it some what difficult to keep the scorn felt from my voice
The Sheikh spoke again
As Ai cursed her fathers life so has Ai cursed his death
As she avenged her self on his body so she still avenges herself on his invisible soul
She has condemned his spirit by the power of her curse to run always with the guar dians of the valley when they go from tomb to tomb on the night of the full moon
Sometimes Mr Harris they have been seen
Have you seen them
asked sharply
No said Lumsden at once but it is not always necessary to see
came to my feet
took my hat from the table
Thank you said for your kind intentions
But this sounds like pretty tall stuff to me
Im sorry
walked toward the door
But before reached it the door swung open and native garbed in conventional English clothes burst into the room
Something had hap pened that concerned the two men to whom had been speaking for both stared at the stranger with apprehen sive faces
After quick glance at me he addressed Lumsden and the Sheikh
Lattal has been found
Near the tomb where you thought
His head is beaten in like the others Lanseer and Weatherbee
Lumsden and the Sheikh looked at me
felt my confident superiority crumbling
turned from the door looking from Lumsden to the Sheikh
Who is Lattal
asked but already premonition was forming in my mind
Lattal said Lumsden was the other of the two men who saw the statue crush Lord Warrender
Weath erbee was the first
Both of them left their hotel at dead of night without word to anyone
Lattal went as if in daze as if some power outside him self was drawing him away from the city
Is it asking too much of you to believe that Lattals death is linked to the other three by the power of Ais curse
Or do you think these deaths series of remarkable coincidences Mr
It was with confidence was far from feeling that hedged
Stranger coincidences have happened
turned to the door again with an effort
Lumsden was there before me
Xis ten
Harris he said not unkindly know how difficult belief must be for you
understand your attitude
But remember Margaret
You dont real ize the nervous condition this has brought her to
Go to her if you must but do not mention her father
If she THE VENGEANCE OF AI chooses to bring him up herself there is nothing to be done about it
Were trying to keep her mind off it
Were urging her to go back to London
Youve got to help
put out my hand and took his
Theres nothing Id like better than to see Lady Warrender back in Lon don said
You may count on me but as for this super natural business thats out abso lutely
But Margaret will not return until she is convinced that her fathers spirit is not bound to run with the guardians of the templetomb of Ai
Then you yourself do not believe
asked quickly
You misunderstand me Harris
do he replied quietly
But the im portant thing is to convince Margaret that the legend is untrue
He bowed slightly and opened the door
The Sheikh AlJubal raised his hand in farewell gesture
heard Lumsden sigh as walked past him into the hall
went out into the bright streets of Cairo heading for the Hotel Memphis and Margaret
admit that my confi dence was severely shaken something had not cared to show Lumsden and the Sheikh
Yet could not wholly believe in mythical curse
Nor could believe that Margaret so sure of her self and her science Margaret so se rene so rational and urbane could credit the existence of such curse
brushed the suggestion aside looking forward to seeing her again and thought that by Christmas we could be married
looked for Margaret on the green terrace of the Hotel Memphis
moment saw her sitting alone by table just under the wall
Her face was pressed into her hands and her attitude was strangely dejected
walked quickly to where she sat and stopped beside her
She was not aware of me until said Hello
Then she lifted her head slowly and looked up at me
She smiled and came to her feet
Peter you surprised me she cried but her voice was listless
Is that your only welcome
asked gently chiding
Im glad you came Peter so glad
need you
For moment there was intensity in her voice and an unusual emphasis
Perhaps Lumsden had been right after all
Ive come to take you back to Lon don said watching her closely hopefully
She looked at me her face expres sionless
dont know when can go back
watched her face
Under her large hat saw her heavily shadowed eyes the line of strain across her forehead the frightened expression of her lips
Theres something wrong with you my dear said
Cant you tell me what it is
FOR time she said nothing
Yes thought Lumsden was right
She is going to tell about it now
had the uneasy belief that she was going to reiterate everything Lumsden and the Sheikh AlJubal had already told me
You remember Asid my fathers servant who stayed here in Cairo after his death
He was very dear to us
He had always been utterly faithful scrupu lously honest
About week before left London had letter from him
In it he said that there were strange things happening about the tomb Ai in the Valley of the Moon
There were stories of weird ghostly figures running each night the moon rose full Asid had seen them he wrote
And one of them was my father
She trembled little
At first didnt believe it
But it worked on me it grew on me
The idea of the spirit of my father haunt ing the Valley of the Moon together with the native guardian spirits be came so terrible that had to come and will not return to London until have seen with my own eyes that my father is not there
said You dont believe that Mar garet
She looked at me
dont know she said
There are strange things here in Egypt stories of weird unbe lievable curses
brushed this aside impatiently
She broke into speech again
STRANGE STORIES On the night of the last full moor went out there with Asid
He in sisted that come
An old friend of my fathers went along Ernest Lums den
went because wanted to prove to him that there was nothing could be nothing
Mr Lumsden did not want me to go
But went
dont know what it was saw
think it was my father
There was something yes
But perhaps it was because of Asid be lieving in it so strongly
We stood little way from the tomb of Ai
Sud denly he clutched my wrist in his hand pressed it hard in his excite ment and said There
Do you see them Lady running running And thought did naked natives and my father dressed as he was when he died
Peter Ive got to see it through
Tomorrow is another full moon
Im going out there again without Asid
This time Ill make sure
Tomorrow morning early
Ernest Lumsden and the Sheikh AlJubal are going too
And want you to come
need you with me
And if there is nothing
Will you go back to London with me
She nodded
imagine that our cavalcade start ing slowly out of Cairo before dawn the next morning would have seemed an ordinary tourists expedition to the casual observer
He would have seen lady and three men the ladys maid and two guides
Our horses took us out of the gray city and into the shadowed desert
Lumsden went ahead with motor lorry carrying searchlight and tent ing equipment
We hoped to reach the Valley of the Moon before the hot test part of the day though it was good seventy miles out of Cairo
In the desert with Cairo already disap pearing under the dunes behind us the first glimmerings of dawn break ing in the sky our purpose seemed vague and faraway to me
Once at the Valley of the Moon the guides helped us throw up the tents
Water was drawn under the palms that sheltered the tombs and rugs were spread
Then with the guides on guard the rest of us retired to the shelter of our tents and there we rested until the sun had set that night
In the shadowy evening we ate light supper and the guides prepared rugs before the tents for the watch
camp chair was put in place for Margaret to rest on
The sudden night of the desert came down with startling abruptness
Our camp was enshrouded in blackness with the dying campfire nickering near the tents
Sitting there heard the Sheikh AlJubal call to Lumsden Is the searchlight in order
Lumsden called back Yes
Ill take care of it
began to wonder suddenly why searchlight had been brought but my thoughts were diverted by the faint yellow light that came suddenly into being above the edge of the desert and then the rim of the round moon began its slow climb over the horizon
We waited tensely saying little watching for the moment when the moon would be wholly above the sand when the faint reddish glow would strike the entrance to the great tomb of Ai
Mar garet strained forward her eyes fixed on the now hazily lighted row of tombs
There was not sound in the night
felt uneasy
Are you all right dear
whis pered
SHE did not turn but felt her hand on mine
She nodded quickly not wanting to speak
Then suddenly she started forward
she murmured tensely
The moon had topped the desert
looked into her face
At that moment the Sheikh shouted
The light Lumsden
The light And before Margarets eyes were focused on the tomb of Ai again the great white light was trained there moving slowly across the face of the tomb then away down the line of tombs in the Valley of the Moon
sudden wind had come up rushing sound in the night
Slowly the ray moved from tomb to tomb
Margaret leaning forward tensely watching its path
But there was nothing living in its light
Back came the ray again to the great tomb of Ai and once more it de scried circle
There was nothing THE VENGEANCE OF AI and the sudden strange wind died as suddenly as it came
Margaret fell back in her chair
Nothing she murmured
Peter there was nothing
Of course not exulted
Of course not
It was Asid wishing so intensely to believe in his native legends she went on
She turned radiant eyes on me Well start for England this week tomorrow
We turned in to get what sleep we could before our early trek back
But could not sleep
lay for what seemed long time awake in the still ness
And then abruptly heard the sound of hushed voices and the pecu liar padding of feet in the sand
rose on my elbow and listened
Then crept stealthily to the opening in the tent and peered out
Lumsden and the Sheikh were walking rapidly toward the tomb of Ai
In moment was out of the tent and had joined them
ASSUMED readily enough that these two were likewise unable to sleep
wanted to jibe at them for their belief in the legend which had seen disproved yet could not come directly out and speak
Tell me asked after whispered greetings had been exchanged why did you move that searchlight so slowly
It was necessary for me to approxi mate the speed of running men re plied Lumsden without moments hesitation
had to keep them in that blinding light so that she wouldnt see
Good God Lumsden dont tell me you still believe Both he and the Sheikh smiled gent ly
Together we came to stop
Lums dens stick was pointing downward and both Lumsden and AlJubal were looking at the sand
We were standing just outside the great tomb of Ai
looked down
There in the sand knew unmolested by wind for there had been very little wind all that night were little pits as if many feet had been running there
Then cry escaped me
Before me in the center of that run ning line saw single track deeper track track that showed clear and distinct on the wettish sand under the overhanging palm trees the track of feet wearing shoes
Even as looked the Sheikh Al Jubal began methodically to scuff away the traces following the wide circle while Lumsden went back along the trail
All my cocksure confidence had left me
understood that these two were obliterating this definite proof of the curse of Ai so that Mar garet might not see in the morning
Lumsden turned to me
The first part of the task have set for myself is finished Harris
Margaret will re turn to London now and you must go with her
Before leave the Valley of the Moon in the morning am going to try to break the curse that binds Warrenders spirit to the tomb of Ai
Then will help you said rashly
quick glance flashed between the Sheikh and Lumsden
detected ap proval in the Sheikhs eyes and felt strengthened in my resolve
Lumsden did not protest and in consequence witnessed phenomenon which has immeasurably strengthened my belief in the powers of light and darkness
Lumsden and the Sheikh had come prepared
large circle was first drawn in the sand short distance away from the templetomb of Ai and both Lumsden and the Sheikh stepped within
But when made as if to follow them they waved me back
You can help best Harris by mount ing guard over Lady Warrenders tent said Lumsden
You will be able to watch quite clearly and should any thing approach the tent you will be there
did not argue but returned at once to the tent
Nevertheless went back with sharp feeling of disap pointment
took my stand near the opening of Margarets tent and watched the strange ceremony that took place within the circle the Sheikh had drawn in the sand
It was the Sheikh who began the ceremony murmuring cryptic incan tation in his native language
Pres ently the great door of the tomb of Ai began to glow weird reddish fire STEANGE STORIES seeming to spread over it outlining it
Then suddenly group of strange lifeless figures began to drift from the closed door naked natives padding automatically outward toward the cir cle occupied by Lumsden and Al Jubal They moved toward the circle white and ghostly stretching out their arms toward the two who sat there yet unable to break into the circle
They passed around it billowing forward and back like wave silent sea of ghastly horror
feeling of terror crept into me dared not think what might happen should these fig ures from the tomb turn toward Mar garets tent
MY attention was attracted to the tomb for from it emerged single figure white and still Lord Warrender
His diaphanous shape was clear and distinct
His rugged face was drawn tight emotionless
He came for ward slowly toward the circle
glanced hastily toward the Sheikh and Lumsden
They were leaning excited ly forward and Lumsden had moved to the very edge of the circle oblivi ous to the hands stretched out toward him held back only by that invisible wall created in some manner by the strange magic known to the Sheikh
The shadowy Lord Warrender ap proached the circle and as he arrived at its outer edge the Sheikh rose up and thundered forth sentence that scattered the native spirits reaching toward the two in the circle
At that moment Lumsden broke the circle and Lord Warrenders vague form drifted through
At once Lumsden closed the circle again
Then strange thing happened
The ghostly shadow of Lord Warrender began to collapse sinking into the ground
Only when it had completely disap peared did the Sheikh turn his atten tion again to the guardian spirits of the tomb of Ai
He began now to drive them back into the tomb
They fought silently to reach beyond the circle then gradually their ghastly intent weakened they turned reluctantly and shuffled in weird procession back to the tomb through the door of which they returned as they had come
The glow began to fade away from the tomb and in few moments the Sheikh and Lumsden left the circle and came wearily over to me
went forward to meet them
He will run no more Harris said Lumsden
Then he looked gently at the tent which hid Margaret from us shook his head little and said Take care of her and get her away at once in the morning
dont want her here if anything should happen
It is not always easy to break curse and sometimes there is penalty
disregarded his enigmatic words then
But month later letter came from Lumsden
It was letter of fare well
He wrote at some length ram bling on for pages but the point of his letter lay in his last pathetic para graph AlJubal was found today near the tomb
He went from the hotel in the night like the others drawn by power we are unable to combat
Soon must go too
have been given short period of grace feel but the end is in sight
told you that it is not easy for mere man to break an ancient curse as we did that night on the desert and foresaw what might happen
That is why did not let you come into the circle with us so that the vengeance of Ai might not pursue you as it has pursued Al Jubal and as it must pursue me soon
We must pay with our lives for breaking the curse of Ai
The letter sent in answer was re turned marked Cannot be found
Inquiries set on foot brought for ward little
Ernest Lumsden had been seen walking from his hotel one night shortly after twelve
That was the last seen of him
Yet know what hap pened
have spared Margaret now my wife this knowledge and hope that no hint of the fate of Lumsden and the Sheikh AlJubal ever reaches her
do not think it will
IN THE NEXT ISSUE THE DOUBLE RING Story of an Egyptian Curse by Will Garth Man Routs Hell His Lesson Learned In Salem Town Where Witches Burned The little baroque was clinging to his chest its tiny hands buried wristdeep in his Sesh The Creeper in Darkness By FRANK BELKNAP LONG JR
Author oi Mind Out of Time The Black Vorter
Familiar of The tiny demoniac attendant witch or warlock
Crabbs English Dictionary
IT WAS very old house indeed
Dale Eliot notebook in hand ice blue eyes intently absorbed moved almost reverently over the duststrewn floor stopping here and there to examine articles of furniture which dated back to the late seven teenth century
Some pieces even an tedated this
Dale Eliot was professional anti quarian
He lived and breathed and had his being in the past
His emotions were so completely out of harmony with the modern world that he fright ened people
All men have roots deep STRANGE STORIES the past and when Dale Eliot talked he brought the past to life
There was something ghostly about him
He seemed to have stepped from the past into the present frozen swimmer emerging from the River of Time near its dim beginnings with the hoary foam of centuries clinging to his garments
But in this old witch house Dale Eliot was in his element
The witch house had been converted into museum for the edification of summer tourists
It was the third old est house in Salem and it stood on high windswept bluff overlooking Salem harbor
It did not attract tourists as the House of Seven Gables did
It was drab squat little house with gambrel roof that did not jut out as gambrel roofs should
Bleakly it faced the har bor presenting to the town merely windowless expanse of weathereroded wood which impressed antiquarians but left normal people cold
Dale Eliot was in all respects the exact opposite of normal person
He moved about in kind of trance ex amining objects which were unique in the annals of Salem
spinning wheel which had once belonged to notori ous witch dogeared prayer book annotated in the curious cramped cal ligraphy of the Reverend Increase Mather dour son of grim and re lentless father dour father of son who had left red thumb prints on the darkest pages of New England his tory
All of the treasured antiques were roped off but Eliot was contemptuous of the Do not touch signs scattered about the room
When he saw an ob ject which attracted him he approached it crept under the ropes and examined it with his hands
He liked the feel of old things
Now he was examining cabinet of drawers which stood under small paned window on the north side of the room
Examining it all over run ning his hands over it in critical ap praisal and even pulling the drawers in and out as he crouched in the gloom
Too bad too bad he murmured
The panels are badly warped
He was tugging at the lowermost drawer and balancing himself pre cariously on his instep when the little figure emerged
It emerged so unobtrusively that he did not notice it until it was standing almost directly beneath his hand blinking up at him in the dim yellow light which suffused the ancient room weirdly
The figure was scarcely three inches in height tiny shriveled human baroque with pointed ears and thin hairy tail
Peaked and duncolored it stood very still on the top of the cab inet and stared malignly up at him its tiny face repulsively puckered its shoulders hunched and misshapen
Eliots flesh congealed
Instinctively he retreated pace his pupils dilating his breath hissing from between his teeth
Do not be alarmed Dale Eliot shrilled the little horror
am your familiar
have waited here for you throughout the years
gasped Eliot his face corpse white
Your family familiar
Your greatgreatgrandfather was member of covin in good standing
at tached myself to all of your ancestors
You were born in this house
Dont you remember Dale Eliot
Eliot passed trembling hand across his brow
knew that was born in Salem he said
But did not remem ber the house
My mother died when was child
was brought up by relatives in Boston
The little figure nodded grimly
Well Dale we are together again
remember you as an infant rosy cheeked smiling but with the mark of his Satanic Majesty already upon you
You mean my ancestors were witches
Eliot asked in small voice
THE figure nodded
Yes Dale
Witches and warlocks
Your entire family attached themselves to his Satanic Majesty far back in the seventeenth century
Before Eliot could protest or cry out the little figure leaped upon him
Tiny clawlike hands fastened on his clothes and clung
With cry Eliot THE CREEPER IN DARKNESS staggered back across the room his fingers clutching at his chest The little horror was burrowing un der his shirt when the guard rushed angrily into the room
The guard was big heavyset man of Portuguese extraction dressed in summer linens
Look here sir he exclaimed
You cant yell like that in here
This is private house which is only open for antickarians
Eliot did not reply
He was backed up against the wall his fingers claw ing at his chest
The little figure was burrowing into his flesh
He could feel it squirming about under his clothes
The guard said Drunk eh
fine thing
And you grown man
He jerked thumb toward the door way of the room
Out he said
If you dont get out under your own steam Ill help you out
Eliot got out
He staggered blindly out of the room and down winding flight of stairs to the street
The sun light was clear and bright over Salem when he emerged on the high wind swept hill overlooking the harbor
But when he reached his lodgings halfmile away the sun westering was spilling down like blood splashingly ensanguining the gambrel roofs and red brick chimney pots of the old houses and turning the waters of Salem harbor deep rosy pink
Eliots room was on the top floor of threestory frame house on winding waterfront street where hollyhocks bloomed
He was trembling uncon trollably when he crossed wellkept lawn and ascended porch which creaked beneath his tread
HIS blue eyes mixture of stupe faction and terror he fumbled for his keys let himself into the house and mounted three flights of stairs to his attic room
He locked the door of the room before he crossed to the window and sat down on narrow cotlike bed
He sat down on the edge of the bed and removed his coat
He was wearing soft linen shirt and black bow tie
He ripped off the tie unbuttoned the shirt and removed it ripped off his undershirt The little baroque was clinging to his chest Its tiny hands were buried wristdeep in his flesh
All about it there was glistening crimson circle halo of bright blood
For an instant he stared down in silence at the tiny shriveled form
So great were his hor ror and revulsion that for an instant the room swayed about him
For an instant he thought he was going to faint The tiny shape was staring mali ciously up at him in the red sunlight which poured in through the open window crimsoning the sheets of the bed
From its narrow sloping skull two tiny black horns sprouted
In the dim light of the old house Eliot had failed to notice the horns
Utter horror engulfed him as he stared
The little baroque said It will take three days
When have firmly at tached myself will never leave you
Eliot spoke to it then
He scarcely recognized his own voice
It seemed like whisper from the grave
You mean your hands will grow into my flesh
Yes Dale
The wounds will heal and your flesh will become covin flesh and will obey the commands of his Satanic Majesty
See have made grooves for my hands
Eventually the wounds will heal
The little horror leaped suddenly from his chest to the sunreddened windowsill and stood perilously poised in the crimson glow mocking him
The two deep grooves where its hands had rested were welling redly
The little baroque said Night is falling
must sleep
Eliot went perfectly white when the little horror leaped back upon him in serted its hands into the encrimsoned grooves and coiled up in an attitude of repose
Sleep Dale it murmured as its eyelids flickered shut
You will not resent me so much tomorrow
And in the months and years to come you will not resent me at all
How Eliot passed the night he never knew
His thoughts were feverish de lirious
He twisted and turned dark ferment in his brain
Twisted and STRANGE STORIES turned until the dawn broke in the east outside the window of his room
When he awoke sunlight was flood ing the attic room
confused and merciful forgetfulness pervaded his faculties
Slowly his drowsy eyes took in the familiar contours of the room the sloping rafters of the ceiling that came to triangular focus high above his head the oaken chest where his clothes lay dresser with photo graph of his mother and brush comb and handmirror familiarly arranged upon it
Then he glanced down at the sheet which covered him and the horror came rushing back filling him with unutterable terror and loathing
Across the white sheet there stretched long trail of tiny bloody footprints
With despairing cry he threw the sheets off and glanced down at his naked torso
The little shape was stir ring restlessly in his flesh
Suddenly it opened its eyes and stared up at him
Good morning Dale it said
He made no attempt to dislodge it
He could not bring himself to touch it
Shaking in every limb he arose from the bed and put on his clothes
He dressed swiftly while the little hor ror mocked him
THE wounds in Eliots flesh were of deep violaceous hue
The blood had darkened coagulated
Slowly the little malign baroque with drew its hands and leaped to the win dowsill
It watched mockingly while Eliot struggled into his shirt and drew on his coat
The big clock in the hall outside was ticking slowly when Eliot de scended the stairs to the street
The little horror was squirming in his flesh again twisting about restlessly under his shirt
Eliot usually glanced at the morn ing paper before he let himself out
But now he simply pulled the paper from beneath the door and stuffed it in his coat pocket going down the steps of the porch and crossing the lawn with the swaying gait of drunken man
His one thought was to escape from the horror by seeking the companion ship of normal people
To escape for an instant from his terror by mingling with normal men and women
Perhaps it was all mad illusion
Perhaps he was entirely mad
He must find out
When he arrived at the little restaurant where he usu ally had breakfast he had reached momentous decision
He would enter the restaurant sit down and tear the horror from his flesh
He would expose it to the gaze of the people about him
He had to share the horror
It was driving him mad
At the little restau rant where he usually had breakfast he would meet people he knew
Kind ly sympathetic people
He must find out
The restaurant was less crowded than usual
Unsteadily he crossed to table in far corner picked up menu and glanced furtively about him
None of his acquaintances was hav ing breakfast at the restaurant this morning
The people who were sit ting there were complete strangers to him
Nevertheless he was determined to bring the horror into view
He could imagine what they would say
God what ghastly thing
What can it be
Its like little man
He could see the patrons of the res taurant rising in sudden terror upset ting their coffeecups sending plates crashing to the floor
But he had to have human sympathy and under standing
He had to know
He was fumbling with the buttons of his shirt when he heard the man at the adjoining table say No they cant explain it
He was found in his shop with his head bitten off
Chewed off
The medical exam iner said it looked like rat had chewed through the flesh of his throat
There were two men at the adjoin ing table
Now the second man was speaking
And they found little red footprints all over the shop
Human footprints tenth of an inch in length
Now thats puzzler for you
Ghastly said the first man
He raised cup of coffee to his lips
Eliot THE CREEPER IN DARKNESS saw his Adams apple rise and fall rise and fall
He was drinking all the scalding coffee at single draught as though the scalding horror in his mind was so unbearable that he had to scald his throat to keep from thinking of it
Suppose we talk about something else said the second man
Yeah lets
Its all in the papers anyway
We can read about it later on
With trembling fingers Eliot ripped the Salem Morning Chronicle from his pocket and spread it out on the table before him
The headlines fairly screamed at him Antiquarian found murdered
And in smaller type beneath Joseph Taylor prominent antiquarian of this city was found gruesomely murdered this morning in his antique shop at Elm Street
Mr Taylor who has liv ing quarters at the rear of the shop was found at am by Eliot rose from the table
Choking his face livid he staggered out of the restaurant into the blinding sunlight
The sunlight smote his eyes dazzling and halfblinding him
Indifferent to the glare clutching at his throat he reeled drunkenly down the street
Disturbed by his reeling gait the little baroque crept from beneath his shirt and stared coldly up at him
Well what is the matter now
What is the matter with you Dale Eliot
You killed him Eliot choked
Jo seph Taylor my friend
Yesterday afternoon when left his shop he was alive and well
The little baroque shrilled Yes know
You were furiously angry with him when you left the shop
He tried to cheat you
He attempted to sell you spurious antique
You swore to get even with him Dale
But didnt really mean it Eliot choked
didnt know Dale listen to me
killed him be cause you hated him
am your faith ful familiar
familiar is pledged to execute its masters wishes
All wiz ards magicians and warlocks have evil wishes
Eliot screamed You murderous little devil
His fingers went out and raked across his chest
Agilely the lit tle horror leaped aside and climbed to Eliots shoulder where it leered up into his face in malign derision
Of course am devil
demon little devil
Eliot groaned
will crush you to death
will strangle you with my hands
The little shape shrilled You can not destroy me Dale
would slip from your grasp
am elastic inde structible
Then will destroy myself
No Dale
will grow into your flesh and you will cease to hate me
child ran so swiftly past him that Eliot did not at first realize that he was not alone with the horror on the sundappled pavement
He did not know that little girl on her way to school had been watching him with wide wondering eyes and had now run swiftly by
The child had seen the little figure perched on his shoulder and was run ning screaming away from him her school books clutched tightly in her arms her pigtails flying
Suddenly she dashed out into the street
ELIOT was so immersed in horror that he saw the child merely as white blur moving swiftly through the sunlight
The street climbed steeply to bluff overlooking the bay
The child was running up the street but the automo bile was coming down
It was coming down with screeching of brakes and although the man in the car was try ing desperately to avoid running down the child he had seen her too late to swerve aside
The screeching brakes jarred Eliot from his daze
His vision cleared
He saw the child clearly saw the careen ing car
The car was less than twenty feet from the running child when he leaped with cry from the pavement He leaped toward the child and gave her violent push sending her sprawl ing across the street to safety
The car was traveling at thirty miles when it struck him
It smashed into STRANGE STORIES him and hurled him thirty feet through the air
With grinding scream it jolted to halt turning completely about on the steep gradient
Eliot thudded to the pavement and lay still blood trickling from his face
Sobbing with terror the child picked herself up and stared at the little form that was running from Eliots sprawl ing body across the pavement
Three feet from the curb the fleeing baroque staggered swayed
Its tiny hands went to his throat
It screamed in shrill agony
It whirled about like top
Then it tottered sideways and collapsed in heap in the dust of the gutter
HENhe who had nearly run down the child emerged whitelipped and trembling from the car the little shape was as unmoving as Eliots big bulk spread out on the pavement
Eliot awoke in world of whiteness
He was lying on soft mattress be tween white sheets and the walls of the room were white and so was the ceiling above him
When he moved whitehot shafts of searing pain shot through him
The girl who was bending above him and
smiling down at him was dressed entirely in white
She laid soft white hand on his forehead
You must rest now she said
You must get some sleep
Youve been unconscious for hours
Who who are you
gasped Eliot
And where where You are in the Salem General Hos pital said the girl
am your night nurse
But what happened
You were struck by an automobile this morning
You saved the life of little girl
Eliot remembered then
He started so violently that the nurse was com pelled to admonish him
You must try not to think about that
Later if you wish but not now
You must get some sleep
Eliot groaned
Sleep sleep
How can rest when that little monster The girl said You mean your good luck piece
Weve all been admiring it
You havent lost it
It is quite safe
They found it in the dust of the road way few feet from vhere you were lying
Eliot stared at her whitelipped
What do you mean
What did you find
The girl smiled and left him
Vhen she returned she was holding small flat object that glittered in the palm of her hand
Here it is she said
Would you like it near you
Tremulously Eliot took the little baroque
It was cold and metallic and very flat now tiny rigid figurine of bronze
The nurse said What an ugly lit tle horror
Wherever did you get it
have seen some unusual good luck charms my uncle collects them but this little bronze is unique
Ive never seen duplicate
She smiled
It is little too large to wear on watch chain
You just carry it loose in your pocket sup pose
It certainly brought you luck this morning
Eliot remembered then
Remem bered passage from an old book which he had read somewhere in the course of his antiquarian browsings and witchcraft studies
Even warlocks may be saved
Even witches and black sorcerers
By hero ism and sacrifice and repentance may warlocks be saved
And each demon that cannot abide goodness will shrivel and become as bronze forsaking its warlock when its warlock forsakes the Evil One dying in agony shriveling and dying
Eliots eyes were shining strangely when he took the nurses hand and de posited the little metallic figure on her palm
You say your uncle collects charms
The girl nodded
Then give this to him with my blessings
The nurse gasped
You you dont want it
Eliot smiled wanly
never want to see it again he said
have lived too long among antiques
shall live henceforth among people talk with them laugh with them work with them yes people are better than an tiques
people are best

Its as near in under the doorway that made to life itself as the movies sharp division between the glare of JL will ever come
Ive done it
California sunlight outside and the Blair OByrnes haunted black eyes lofty shadows of OByrnes long dim were bright with triumph
Abe Silvers gaunt and dark and hope youre right he said wearyeyed shifted the cigar to the around the cigar
Ive waited long other side of his mouth and stepped time for it
And God knows youve STRANGE STORIES spent more years than you ought and more money than even you could afford
Why have you done it Blair
man with your money your back ground shutting yourself up here in the dark sweating over shadows
havent been shut up away from life Ive been shut in with it
OByrnes smile spread across the pallor of his delicate face
Its life itself Ive been groping after all these years and Ive found it Abe
Ive got it
Got the illusion of it maybe
little better than MetroCosmic has been filming for the last few years
And if its as good as you say well buy it and so what
OByrne turned to him fiercely his dreamhaunted eyes suddenly blazing
tell you this is life
As near as shadows can come too near per haps
Moving pictures
Theyll have to find new name for what Ive got
It isnt pictures its breath ing living reality
Ive worked over it until nothing else seemed to mat ter nothing else seemed real
Ive got it Abe
Its life
ABE SILVERS shifted the cigar back across his mouth and if his eyes were understanding his voice was only patient
He had heard such words before from many fiercely sin cere inventors
That he had known OByrne for many years did not alter his accustomed attitude toward such things
All right he murmured
Show me
Wheres the projection room Blair
OByrne waved thin un steady hand toward the center of the big studio where under battery of highhung lights Ushaped bar of dull silver rose from low platform to the height of mans waist
Be yond it against the wall bulked big rectangular arrangement of chromium and glass behind whose face bulbs were dimly visible
Silvers snorted
That thing looks like radio that doubledover pipe
But the screen man the seats the Im telling you this is utterly new Abe
Youll have to clear your mind of all your preconceived ideas of what moving picture should be
All that is obsolete from this minute on
The moving picture is as dead as the magic lantern
This is the new thing
These batteries of lights that radio as you call it the platform and bar one for each individual spec tator But what is it
What happens
cant explain it to you now said OByrne impatiently
For one thing you wouldnt believe me until after youve seen it
And it would take weeks to give you enough groundwork to understand the prin ciples
The things too complex for anyone to explain in words
cant even explain the appearance except in metaphors theres never been any thing like it before
Roughly though its the projec tion of the illusion of life on three dimensional screen composed of fogged light
Other men are just beginning to fumble around with the principles of threedimensional mov ies projected on flat screen giving the appearance of stage with depth
Thats going at it clumsily
Ive ap proached the problem from much newer angle
My screen itself is threedimensional the light that bathes you when the batteries of arcs are on
Youre in the midst of it the action is projected on the light all around you from double films taken from slightly different angles on the stereoscopic principle
Ill show you later
And there is in that bar youre to hold on to sufficient current to stim ulate very selectively the nerves which carry tactile impression to the brain
Youll feel as well as hear and see
Youll even smell
On occasion you may actually taste its close enough to the sensations of smelling to work out
Only that doesnt figure so much in this case for you as spectator will not enter into the ac tion
Youll simply witness it from closer quarters than any audience has ever dreamed of doing before
Here step up on the platform and take hold of the rod there at the curve
Thats it
Now hold tight and dont be surprised
Remember MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS nothing like this has ever been done before
Abruptly the great banks of lights blazed into radiance that closed the dazzled Silvers about in soft pour ing brightness
There was quality of mistiness about it that made even his own hands invisible before him on the bar
It was as if the light poured upon innumerable motes in the air so refracting from their in finitesimal surfaces that nothing was visible but that shimmer of bright blindness
Silvers gripped the bar and waited
Through the bright fog voice as smooth as cream spoke in vast clear echoes rolling in from all around him at once filling the little artificial world of mist wherein he stood lost
Mellowly the deep tones said You are about to enter an en chanted wood outside Athens on midsummer night to share in dream that Shakespeare dreamed over three hundred years ago
Titania Queen of Faeryland will be played by Anne Acton
Oberon the King is Philip Graves Abe Silvers clutched the bar in amazement as that unctuous voice rolled on
Anne Acton and Philip Graves were under contract to his own MetroCosmic and every one of the other names were stars of the first magnitude
The greatest actors of the day were playing in this in credible fragment of Midsummer Nights Dream
What it had cost OByrne he shuddered to think
The creamy voice died away
The mist began to clear
Silvers hands closed hard on the bar and he stared in blankest incredulity about the dim blue glades of forest stretching around him silvery in the light of highriding moon
breeze whis pered through the leaves blowing cool on his face
Save that it did not stir hair of his head he could have believed it an actual breeze sighing through the moonlit dark
He looked down
He was himself invisible disembodied no longer standing on bare floor but in the midst of flowering meadow whose grasses were faintly fragrant at his feet
There was no flicker no visible lightandshadow composition of the projection upon this incredible three dimensional screen that surrounded him
The glade stretched away into actual distances much deeper than the studios walls could possibly con tain the illusion of deep starry sky overhead was perfect the flowers in the grass were so real he thought he could have knelt and gathered them in his hands
Then under the trees the mists parted like curtain and the Queen of Faeryland came splendidly into the moonlit glade
Anne Acton had never looked so lovely
The long veil of her silverpale hair streamed like gossamer behind her and every curve and shadowy roundness was as real as life itself
Yet there hovered about her hint of unreality so that she blended perfectly the illusion of fan tasy and reality as she moved over the unbending grass the bright wings streaming from her shoulders
THERE was blast of silvery chal lenge from elfin horns and into the moonlight strode Oberon his lean features wrathful
The famous deep tones of Philip Graves resounded an grily through the moonlight
Titania answered in silvery defiance
Then came full rich human voices ringing through the wood
Phoebe Templeton in Hermias rustling satin came radiantly into the glade brush ing so close by the watching Silvers that he caught whiff of her per fume felt the touch of her satin skirts
And he knew almost he knew that he could put out hand and stop her so warmly real was she at that close range
Her lovely throaty voice called to Lysander behind her
And then somehow the forest was slipping away past Abe Silvers face somehow he had the illusion of walking as if in dream down an en chanted forest aisle the dim air quivering with starlight and Helena came running and weeping through the trees stumbling sobbing the name of Demetrius
She passed
Silvers started invol untarily as from swaying branch STRANGE STORIES above him pealed the wild half human laughter of Puck delicate as the chatter of squirrel and down through the air over his very shoul der the breeze of his passing fanning Silvers face the lithe little goblin sprang
The scene clouded over as if mist had been drawn across the moon
Silvers blinked involuntarily and when he looked again Titania lay ex quisitely asleep on the dewspangled bank where the wild thyme grew
Then through the magichaunted wood suddenly shrilled bell
In sistently metallically it rang
Sil vers glanced about the glades of the forest trying to locate among the dewshimmering leaves the source of that irritating noise
And suddenly the Athenian woods melted like smoke about him
Incredulously he stared around big bare studio
It was like waking in bewilderment from dream so vivid that reality itself paled beside its memory
The studio wants you on the tele phone Abe said OByrnes voice
Here wake up
Didnt you hear the bell
SILVERS shook himself laughed sheepishly
Im still in Athens he admitted blinking
Thats the damnedest thing ever studio did you say
Wheres the phone
Thinly over the wire came wor ried voice
Hate to bother you chief but think you ought to know
Anne Ac tons been mumbling around in sort of daze for half an hour
The doctor cant do thing with her
And Philip Graves passed out on set and is just kind of whispering to himself poetry it sounds like
Silvers blinked
Ddont let the papers get it
Ill be right over
He slammed the telephone back on its cradle and turned blankly to OByrne
Somethings gone wrong with couple of our actors you stole he said
Ive got to get back right away
But listen Blair youve got something How long will it take you to have some more of these bar and platform arrangements rigged up
Say dozen for starter
Id like to have our board see it as soon as possible
This is going to be the most tremendous thing that ever hap pened in motion pictures
When can you have things ready to show the board
dont know Abe
Somehow Im little afraid of it
Good God man what do you mean
dont know exactly but did you have feeling as you watched the action that somehow it came too near to life
Blair Im afraid youve been working too hard on this
Let me handle it from now on will you
And stop thinking about it
Ive got to get back to the studio now and see whats happened to my actors attack of temperament probably but Ill see you tonight about quantity production
Until then you wont let anyone else in on this will you
You know wont Abe
Its yours if you want it
All the way back to the studio Silvers mind was spinning with the magnitude of what lay before him
He had dared to let the inventor know how enormously impressed he was how anxious to have the new process because he knew OByrne so well
The man was wealthy in his own right indifferent to fame to everything but the deep need to cre ate which had driven him so hard for so many years toward the completion of his miracle
Miracle in three di mension
It seemed like dream what he had just seen but behind it lay the prospect for fortune vaster than any movie magnate had ever dared to hope for
To control this was to control the whole world
Sil vers clenched his cigar tighter and dreamed magnificent dreams
Anne Acton lay on low couch in her lavish little dressing bungalow staring up with conscious pathos into the doctors face as Silvers came into the room
Somehow illogically it was shock to him to see her here when he had so short time before MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS left that perfect illusion of herself in the enchanted wood outside Ath ens asleep on the bank of wild thyme
How are you Anne
he de manded anxiously for she repre sented fabulous sum to the com pany and an illness now in the midst of her latest picture would be ruin ous
Is she all right Doc
When did she come out of it
While they were phoning you Abe said Acton herself in faint pathetic voice moving her head un easily so that the great slipping rope of silverpale hair moved across the brocade
It it was all so queer
Suddenly felt too tired to move as if all the strength had drained right out of me
And must have fainted but wasnt really out
Kept having sort of dreams dont remember now woods somewhere and music
And suddenly it all ended and opened my eyes here
Im all right now only feel as weak as kitten
She held up an exquisite hand to show it quivering
What is it Doc
demanded Sil vers anxiously
Ummra overwork perhaps gen eral exhaustion its impossible to say definitely without further exam ination
Will she be okay now
see no reason why with rest and care she shouldnt be
Ill send for your car Anne said Silvers authoritatively
Youre going home to bed
Ill see you later
Philip Graves in the braidbe decked finery of movie caballero was sitting up on his couch and holding cigarette in unsteady fin gers when Silvers pushed through the little knot of attendants that sur rounded him
Feeling better Phil
he de manded
What was it
Nothing nothing said the actor impatiently
Im okay now
Just passed out for few minutes
Ill be all right
Abe Silvers lost no time in calling meeting of the board
The twelve members of MetroCosmic stood about in twos and threes murmuring incredulously in the shadows of the OByrne studio on the night when the first dozen barplatforms were erected
Silvers had not dared to describe fully this modern miracle
Its like nothing you ever saw be fore he warned them as rather sheepishly they allowed themselves to be herded forward to the plat forms
When they were all at their stations and Silvers signaled OByrne to begin he glanced once around the little company before the lights blazed on Doubtfully they returned his stare with murmur or two of protest rising
Feel so damn silly an official said standing here
Mean to say there isnt any screen
What are we sup posed to look at
AND then like wall of brilliant blindness the foggy light closed down upon them and every man was cut off from his fellows so that he stood alone and disembodied in the heart of that soft misty blaze
Star tled exclamations sounded through the mist murmurs that died away as Silvers heard for the second time the creamy smoothness of the announcers voice rolling through the dimming brightness
You are now about to enter an en chanted wood outside Athens on midsummer night to share in dream that Shakespeare dreamed Somehow as the play went on Abe Silvers began to wonder little un easily at the violence of the quarrel between Titania and Oberon that flamed almost tangibly through the clear dim air
Had they fought be fore so fiercely
Had they gibber of wild inhuman laughter the long leap of Puck over his shoul der broke the queer thought half formed just as bell began to shrill through the forest
He knew mo ment of unreality
He remembered that in the previous performance the bell had not rung until Titania lay down to sleep on the bank where the wild thyme grew
But with shocking completeness the forest vanished
Sil vers stared blankly around the stu dios reaches that had so suddenly STRANGE STORIES replaced the glades of faeryland blinking at the circle of dazed men in amazement
Telephone for you Abe OByrnes voice called through the fading mists of the dream that had so strongly gripped him
He grinned sheepishly and stepped down from the platform
Listen chief babbled distressed voice over the wire shrill above the rising babble of delight behind Sil vers Actons out like light at the Grove Is she plastered
dont think so but try to tell the papers that
She wait oh shes just coming out of it
Whatll we do
Send her home sighed Silvers
Ill get onto the papers right away
Vhat life
HE turned back to OByrne with shrug
Actons passed out again he murmured unhappily
wonder if she well if she folds now in the middle of Never Tomorrow well lose our shirts on it
Im going to get doctor to Abe said OByrne in voice so quiet that the other man turned to him in surprise Abe do you realize that every time we run this picture Anne Acton faints
wonder if the other actors feel the same reaction
Why what do you mean
Why should they
Blair are you going crazy
Silvers voice was stoutly confident but despite himself an uneasy little flicker woke in his mind
Philip Graves who played Oberon had been dazed and out of his head too that other time
And yes hadnt he no ticed an item in gossip column say ing that Phoebe Templeton had col lapsed at tea in New York
Was it the same day
Rather terrifyingly he thought it was
But of course all this was the most flagrant nonsense
His job now was to keep Acton out of the papers
She had not endeared herself to reporters and he knew they would make the story sound as bad as possible
They the phone rejig again
wire from Philip Graves man has just come in Abe his wifes voice told him worriedly
Philips been taken terribly sick on shipboard
His man says it will be in all the papers tomorrow and he wants your advice
Silvers ran hand distractedly through his hair
Thanks he said little blankly
Ill take care of it
Be home later
He turned to the men still grouped around the barplatforms in their babble of amazed delight
They had not heard his lowvoiced conversa tions at the desk
Weve got this fellow under con tract havent we
said someone anx iously at his elbow
Ought to get go ing on production right away
This is the most tremendous thing that ever happened
Yes hell let us have it Silvers told him abstractedly
Blair hows the production on the first hundred barplatforms coming
Weve got to give larger showing right away
hundred and fifty will be ready in about week OByrne admitted reluctantly
But Abe Abe do you think we ought to do it
Silvers pulled him aside
Look Blair he said gently you mustnt let your imagination run away with you
What possible connection can there be between the showing of this picture and the fact that few over worked nervous people have fainting spells
Ill admit its coincidence but weve got to be sensible
We cant let the biggest thing that ever happened in pictures slip through our fingers just because some dizzy actress passes out once or twice
OByrne shrugged little
won der he murmured as if thinking aloud how long people have been trying to create life
Somethings always prevented it no ones been allowed to succeed
This thing of mine isnt life but its too near it to leave me at peace with myself
think theres penalty for usurping the powers of godhead for coming too close to success
Im afraid Abe
Blair will you do me favor
demanded Silvers
Will you go to MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS bed and forget all about this until morning
Ill see you tomorrow
Right now Im up to my neck in trouble
OByrne smiled ghostily
All right he said
TEMPLETONFREDERICKS ELOPEMENT
That was the headline the news boys were yelling when Silvers stepped out of his car the next day
He looked twice at the headline to be sure for the romance of Phoebe Tem pleton not with Bill Fredericks but with Manfield Drake had kept screen magazines in ecstasies for the past six months
The wedding was to have been this week but he bought paper hastily wild thought flash ing through his mind
Templeton and Fredericks had played the lovers in OByrnes photoplay
Bill and have known one another for about six months Phoebe Tem pleton was quoted as saying but we never realized until last night how much we meant to each other
It happened rather miraculously
was on my way west and Bill was heTe in Hollywood
And suddenly in Den ver it came over me that simply must talk to him
phoned long dis tance and well its all pretty hazy to look back on but chartered plane and met him in Yuma and we were married this morning
Of course feel badly about Manfield but really this was too big to fight against
Weve known since ten oclock last night that we were meant for each other
Silvers tucked the paper under his arm and bit down hard on his cigar
It was at ten last night that they had watched Hermia and Lysander in the actual breathing presences of Templeton and Fredericks murmur ing passionate love under high floating moon
For moment fan tastic wonder crossed his mind
must be going nuts he murmured to himself
week later an audience of hun dred and fifty people gathered for the real preview of OByrnes Mid summer Nights Dream
The bar platforms had been set up in the big studio that had seen the first running of the miraculous illusion
It was crowded now with murmurous and skeptical people officers and direc tors of MetroCosmic sprinkling of wives
Silvers conquered an inex plicable uneasiness as he sought OByrne in corner near the con trols
Blair was sitting on heavy stool before the machine and the face he turned to his friend was full of queer strained tension
He said his voice thread of sound Abe Ive had the maddest notion that every time show this the fig ures come back realer than before into the scenes they play
Maybe they dont always hold to the action we photographed maybe the plot carries them on beyond what Shake speare wrote more violently than SILVERS fingers gripped the other mans shoulders hard
Sharply he shook him an absurd uneasiness darkening his memory of that im pression of fiercer violence in the quarrel between Oberon and Titania the last time he saw the play even as he said firmly Snap out of it Blair
Youve been working too hard
Maybe someone else could run the picture tonight you need rest
OByrne looked up at him apathet ically his alarm gone suddenly flat
No Ill do it
If youre really de termined to run the thing maybe Id better
Maybe can control them better than an assistant could
After all created them
Silvers looked down at him for moment in frowning silence
Then he shrugged and turned toward the last empty barplatform where the audience waited the beginning of the show
OByrne was dangerously over worked he told himself
After this was over he must go to sanatorium for long rest
His mind was crack ing
Misty radiance closed down about him veiling the hundred and fifty from his vision
There was mo ment of murmurous wonder punctu ated by small halffrightened screams STRANGE STORIES from few of the women as each spectator was shut off into little world of silence and solitude
Into the silvery mist that familiar rich voice rolled smoothly
For the third time Silvers saw the broad gray glades of faeryland hedged with im memorial forest opening magically up about him
For the third time Ti tania trailed her streaming wings into the moonlight
Oberon strode with jingle of mail from among the trees and they met in fury halfway down the glade their feet pressing the bending grass with elfin light ness
But there was no lightness in their anger
That ancient quarrel flared up in violence between them and the breezes shivered with their wrath
Again Hermia and Lysander came half laughing half fearful into the woods
Again Helena sobbed Deme trius name among the unanswering trees
Puck flitted in goblin glee about his business of enchantment and Titania lay down to sleep on the spangled grass among the wild thyme
THIS time no telephone bell broke into the magic of the dream
And again these were living people who moved so tangibly before the audience the wind of their passing brushing them the sound of their breathing in their ears when they stood near going about their magic haunted ways as obliviously as if the spectators were the phantoms not they
Their loves and hates and heartbreak were vividly real under that incredibly real moon
Once or twice Silvers thought vaguely that here and there in the action things happened not exactly as he remembered them
Had Titania actually slapped Oberons dark angry face before she swept out of the glade
Had Hermia and Lysander kissed quite so lingeringly under that deepshadowed oak
But as the play went on Silvers lost all thought of times that had gone before and sank fathoms deep in the reality of the scene before him
Puck lured the spellbewildered lovers into the fastnesses of the for est
They went stumbling through the fog quarreling blinded by mist and magic and their own troubled hearts
Swords flashed in the moon light
Lysander and Demetrius were fighting among the veiled trees
Puck laughed shrill and high and inhu man and swept his brown arm down
And from Lysander came choked gasp the clatter of fallen sword
Demetrius bent fiercely above him
Silvers watched the bright blood bub bling from his side saw the blade drip darkly smelled the acrid sharp ness of that spreading stain
The il lusion was marvelous
Lysanders death was miracle of artistry from the first choked gasp of pain to the last bubbling of blood in his throat the last twist of handsome silk sheathed limbs
Lysanders death Something troubled Silvers mem ory but before he could capture it womans voice cried hysterically somewhere in the misty forest Hes dead hes dead
and suddenly blankly the forest was gone from about them and he was staring into dazed halfdreaming faces where an instant before faeryland had stretched depth upon depth of moonlit dimness where Lysander had lain dying on the moss
Somewhere in the crowd woman was sobbing hysterically
Hes dead tell you
Lysanders dead and he doesnt really die in the play
Someones killed him
That was real blood smelled it
Oh get me out of this awful place
Silvers brushed the fog of dream land from his eyes and was halfway across the floor to the projection machine before the scream had ended for he remembered now that tug of memory as Lysander fell
Shake speares play was romance not trag edy
Lysander should not have died
OByrne clung to his high stool his fingers whiteknuckled as he stared into Silvers eyes
You see
he said in strained monotone
You see what mass hyp notism will do
They couldnt help it poor things they must be half alive wandering in the fog
Silvers voice rang sharply
MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS Blair snap out of it
What are you raving about
Are you mad
The staring eyes turned to his al most apathetically
was afraid said OByrne in that whispering monotone as if he spoke in dream
was afraid to run it before this many people should have guessed what would hap pen when Acton and Graves and Are you still harping on that co incidence
demanded Silvers in fierce undertone
Cant you see how foolish it is Blair
What earthly African savages Tibetan nomads Chinese peasants South American Indians
Even the ancient Egyptians highly civilized as they were delib erately made their drawings angular and unlifelike
All of them declared and believed that too good likeness would draw the soul out into the picture
Well yes everybodys heard of such things but youre not suggest ing After the Templeton elopement after Anne Actons faintingpells THE PRISONER OF MARS Complete BookLength Novel of War Between Worlds By EDMOND HAMILTON and Many Other Unusual Stories and Features oming in the May Issue of Our Companion Scientifiction Magazine STARTLING STORIES AT ALL STANDS connection can there be between pic tures on screen and living people some of them half the world away
Ill admit what happened tonight was Did you ever hear broke in Blair softly as if he were following some private train of thought and had not heeded word of Silvers harangue of savages covering their faces when explorers bring out their cameras
They think photo graph will steal their souls
Its an idea so widespread that it cant have originated in mere local superstition
Tribes all over the world have it
and Philip Graves illness yes after what happened tonight how can you deny it Abe
No the Egyptians the modern savages were closer to the truth than we
Only before now no likeness has been perfect enough to absorb sufficient personality so that people could notice it
But these il lusions of mine theyre real living breathing
While you watch you cant believe the actual men and women arent standing in front of you
It had an effect on Acton and Graves when only you were watching enough of their personality was STRANGE STORIES drained out of them into the illusion by your own temporary conviction that they were there so that they went into vague dreams of woodland and music
dont know how the other actors were affected do know that several of them were sick and dizzy that day
havent checked maybe Ive been afraid to
When the twelve boardmembers were watching the drain was stronger so that Graves was really ill on shipboard and Acton couldnt be roused from her faint until the telephone call to you broke the illu sion here
It affected Templeton and Bill Fredericks another way hypno tized them into believing what the audience was believing that they were really in love ECOLLECTION flooded into Silvers mind
He remembered what he had felt when he read the headlines of the elopement
He said Could it happen that way Blair
How greatly could mass mind affect the reactions of the people it con centrates on
thought of it before if twelve individuals each con vinced for time that he saw two people desperately in love might really work sort of persuasion on those two No thats crazy
It couldnt happen
You saw it happen murmured Blair quietly
You saw what hap pened when hundred and fifty peo ple joined in that fierce concentra tion that utter conviction that they saw mans sword poised aimed de scending mass hypnotism it was
For majority of them that sword really struck their imagination out ran the actual fact and they thought they saw Lysander spitted on Deme trius blade
They thought they saw him die
Well he didnt did he
mean nothing happened this time or theyd have called me
thin smile twisted up OByrnes strained mouth
He reached behind him
Silvers heard click and real ised that the telephone had been ly ing out of its cradle on the desk ever since he reached Blairs side
wanted you to understand be fore they broke the news to you OByrne was explaining gently
And knew the telephone would inter rupt ime unless Shrill buzzing whirred from the desk
With little spurt of terror for what he had yet to learn Silvers snatched it up
voice shouted thinly in his ear Silvers
Is that you chief
My God Ive been trying to get you all evening
Actons been in coma for over an hour doctor cant rouse her
And call just came in from London that Phil Graves is out too cant be waked
And whats that
Words just come in that Templetons passed out too and Bill Fredericks has dropped dead
Whats the matter with this town
Its like the end of the world Abe OByrnes voice behind him twisted Silvers around like hand on his shoulder
The receiver shrilled unnoticed as their eyes met
OByrnes face was almost serene knowledge of what the telephone was crying showed in his eyes
He said Do you believe me now
Do you understand
Do you realize how much of life itself Ive woven into this damnable thing Ive made
Yes its like twodimensional pictures that carry shadow of the third enough dark to give feeling of depth
In my threedimensional pic ture Ive somehow got shadow of the fourth life maybe or some thing too near it
Maybe thats what the fourth dimension is life itself
But it wont kill men again not again
THE crash of glass shattered into the hysterical buzz of the crowd
Silence like death fell over the con fusion of the murmurous throng among the barplatforms as they turned white faces toward the corner
OByrnes frail arms swung his heavy stool with desperate strength crunch ing and smashing and crashing among the delicate intricacies of his pro jector
Silvers clutched the still shrilling telephone and watched him not moving
Question of Identity No Pang of Hunger nor Torment of Thirst Can Stifle the Questions of Who Where and What
By TARLETON FISKE Author of The Sorcerers Jewel etc
LIMBS were lead
My that moved like sluggish quicksil heart was great coiled ver back and forth in burning waves
clock that throbbed rather than ticked ever so slowly
My lungs were metal sponges my head bronze bowl filled with molted lava Back and forth consciousness and unconsciousness interplaying against background of slow dark pain
felt just that nothing more
was in coJBn in wooden coffin STRANGE STORIES had heart lungs body head but felt nothing external that is my body did not impinge on anything
was not sitting or standing or walking or lying or doing anything that could feel
was just heart lungs body head alone in darkness that was filled with the pulsing of muted agony
This was myself
But who was
The thought came the first real thought for before that had been only an awareness of being
Now wondered as to the nature of my being
Who was
was man
The word man aroused certain as sociations which struggled through the pain through the thumping heart and gasping lung sensation
If was man what was doing
Where was
AS IF in response to the thought awareness increased
had body and therefore possessed hands ears eyes
must try to feel hear see
But could not
My arms were lumps of immovable iron
My ears knew only the sound of silence and the throbbing that came from within my tortured body
My eyes were sealed by the leaden weight of enor mous eyelids
This knew and felt panic
What had happened
What was wrong with me
Why couldnt feel and hear and see
had been in an accident and was lying on hospital bed under ether
That was one explanation
Perhaps had been crippled blinded deafened maimed
Only my soul ex isted faintly like whispering that rustles through the ruins of an old old house
But what accident
Where had been before this
must have lived
What was my name
resigned myself to the darkness as strove to grapple with these problems and the darkness was kind
My body and the darkness seemed to be equally detached so that they min gled
It was peaceful too peaceful for the thoughts that throbbed through my brain
The thoughts fought and clamored and finally screamed until felt myself awaken
It was the sensation vaguely re called of finding ones foot asleep
It spread over my body so that pleasant tingling made me aware bit by bit of having definite arms and hands definite chest and pelvis defi nite legs and feet
Their outlines emerged and were defined by that tingling
burring droned in my spine as though den tists drill had bit into it
Simulta neously became aware that my heart was Congo drum within my chest my lungs great gourds swell ing and sinking in frantic rhythm
exulted in the pain for through it felt myself
That sensation of de tachment faded and knew that complete intact lay against soft ness
But where
That was the next question and sudden energy seemed ready to solve it
My eyes opened
They encoun tered nothing but continuation of the blackness which lurks behind the curtains of closed lids
If anything the blackness was deeper richer
could see nothing of myself and yet my eyes were open
Was blind
My ears still heard no sound other than the mysterious inspiration of my own breath
My hands moved ever so slowly at my sides rustling against cloth which told me that my limbs were clothed and yet unblanketed
They moved upward outward
An inch two inches three and then they en countered hard unyielding surfaces on either side
They rose upward prompted by fear
Six inches and another unyielding surface of wood
My feet thrust out as stretched and through shoeleather the tips of my toes encountered wood
My mouth opened and sound poured forth
It was only rattle though had meant to scream
For my thoughts whirled around one name one name that somehow groped through haze and loomed as the symbol of my unreasoning fear
knew name and wanted to scream
Edgar Allan Poe
And then my rattling voice whis QUESTION Of IDENTITY pered unprompted that which so feared in connection with this name
The Premature Burial whis pered
Poe wrote it
am living it
was in coffin in wooden cof fin with the hot stale air of my own corruption reeking in my nostrils burning in my lungs
was in coffin locked in earth and yet was alive
Then found strength
My hands had been frantically scratching and clawing at the surface above my head
Now they gripped the sides of my prison and thrust outward with all strength my legs braced at the foot of the box
My legs then kicked
New vigor the vigor of madman rushed through my boil ing blood
In sheer frenzy in an agony born of the fact that could not scream and give expression to it lashed out with both feet at the bottom of the coffin felt it splinter and give way
Then the sides cracked my bleed ing fingers clutched at the earth be yond and rolled over burrowing and scrabbling at the moist soft packed earth
dug upwards wheez ing in sort of mindless desperation as worked
Instinct alone combatted the insane horror which gripped my being and transformed it into the activity which alone could save me
They must have buried me in hurry
The earth above my grave was shallow
Choking and half suf focated clawed my way to the top after endless eons of utter delirium during which the dust of the grave covered me and wriggled like worm through the dark ground
My hands reached up to form cavity then lunged upward with full strength and burst through to the surface
crawled out into silvery moon light flooding down upon world of marble toadstools which sprouted richly from the mounds of grass all about me
Some of the fantastic stone growths were crossshaped others bore heads or great urnlike mouths
They were the headstones of graves naturally but saw only toadstools fat bloated toadstools of deadwhite pallor reaching unthink able roots into the ground below to draw forth nourishment
lay staring at them staring back at the pit through which had come up out of death into life once again
did not could not think
The words Edgar Allan Poe and Pre mature Burial had come unbidden to my brain and now for some rea son found myself whispering in hoarse dreadful voice then croon ing more loudly Lazarus
RADUALLY my panting sub sided and drew fresh strength from the air that sang through my lungs
stared at the grave again my grave
It bore no headstone
It was poor grave in poor section of the cemetery probably Potters Field
Nearly on the outskirts of the ne cropolis it was and weeds writhed over the poor graves
There was no headstones and it made me remem ber my question
Who was
It was unique prob lem
had been someone before died but who
Surely this was novel case of amnesia to return to new life in the actual sense of the phrase
Who was
Funny could think of words like amnesia and yet could not in the least associate them with anything personal in my past
My mind was utterly blank
Did death do this to me
Was it permanent or would my mind awaken in few hours just as my body had
If not was in sore straits
didnt know my name or my station what had been
For that matter on reflection didnt even know where was
The names of cities flooded foolishly through my brain
Chicago Milwaukee Los Angeles Washington Bombay Shanghai Cleveland Chichen Itza Pernambuco Angkor Wat Rome Omsk Carthage
could not associ ate single one with myself or for that matter explain how knew those names
thought of streets of Mariposa Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and STRANGE STORIES Broadway and Center Street and Park Lane and the Champs Elysees
They meant nothing to me
thought of proper names
Felix Kennaston Ben Blue Ralph Waldo Emerson Studs Lonigan Arthur Gordon Pym James Gordon Bennett Samuel Butler Igor Stravinsky and they represented no image of myself
could see all those streets visu alize all those people picture all those cities but myself could not associate with any of them
Comedy tragedy drama it was mad scene to play in cemetery at nightfall
had crawled out of grave without headstone and all know was that was man
And yet who
My eyes roved over my person ly ing in the grass
Beneath mud and dirt saw dark suit torn in places and discolored
It covered the body of tall man thin body poorly muscled and flatchested
My hands rustling over my person were long and leanly muscular they were not the hands of labourer
Of my face knew nothing though passed my hand over each feature in turn
One thing felt certain oft whatever the cause of my apparent death was not physically maimed
STRENGTH prompted me to rise
rose to my feet stumbled over the grass
For few minutes had that drunken floating sensation but gradually the ground became solid under my feet knew awareness of the cool night wind on my forehead heard with indescribable joy the chirping of crickets from swamp afar
walked around the tombstones gazed at the clouding sky felt dew and dampness fall
But my brain was aloof detached wrestling with invisible demons of doubt
Who was
What was to do
could not wander strange streets in my disheveled condition
If presented myself to authorities would be put away as madman
Besides did not want to see any one
This fact realized quite sud denly
did not wish to see lights or people
was different
It was the feeling of death
Was still
Unable to bear the thought fran tically groped for clues
tried every means of awakening dormant memories
Walking endlessly the night through combatting chaos and confusion fighting the gray clouds that clung to my brain wandered up and down the deserted corner of the cemetery
Exhausted stared at lightened sky
And then my thoughts fled away even the confused ones
knew only one thing the need for rest and peace and forgetfulness
Was it the deathurge
Had risen from the grave only to return
neither knew nor cared
Actu ated by compulsion as inexplicable as it was overpowering stumbled toward the ruins of my grave and crept inside burrowing like mole into the grateful darkness whilst the earth tumbled in behind me
There was enough air the thought came to enable me to breathe while lay back in the shattered coffin
My head fell back and settled in my coffin to sleep
The muttering and rumbling died away from dreams could not re member
They died away from dreams and grew in reality until sat up pushing wet earth so that it fell around me
was in the grave
Again terror
Somehow the hope had lurked that this was dream and awakening might bring me to grate ful reality
But was in the grave and storm howled above
crawled upward
It was still night or rather in stinct prompted me to believe that it was night again
must have slept the clock around
This storm had kept people from the graveyard kept them from discovering the torn earth and its inmate
rose to the surface and the rain lashed me from skies wild with anger
And yet was happy happy for the life knew
drank the rain the thunder enraptured me as though it were symphony marvelled at the lightnings emerald beauty
was alive
All about me corpses rotted and QUESTION OF IDENTITY sloughed nor could all the fury of the unleashed elements imbue them with one spark of existence or of memory
My own poor thoughts my own poor life were infinitely pre cious in comparison to the lot of those below
had cheated worm and maggot let the storm howl
would howl with it share in the cosmic jest
Vitalized in the truest sense of the word began to walk
The rain washed the earthstains from my gar ments and body
Singularly felt no cold no especial dampness
was aware of these things but they did not seem to penetrate
For the first time realized another odd thing was not hungry or thirsty
At least did not seem to be
Had appetite died with memory
won dered
Memory the problem of identity still pressed
walked along impelled by the storm
Still pondering my feet carried me past the confines of the cemetery
The gale leading me seemed to guide my footsteps out onto the stone sidewalk of deserted street
walked almost without heeding
Who was
How had died
How revived
walked through the rain down the dark street alone in the wet velvet of the night
Who was
How had died
How revived
crossed block entered nar rower street still stumbling alone with the wind and the laugh of thunder from clouds mocking my be wilderment
Who was knew
My name the street told me
Summit Street
Who lived on Summit Street
Arthur Derwin my self
was Arthur Derwin of Sum mit Street
used to be something couldnt remember
had lived lived for years and yet all could recall was my name
How had died
had been to the seance and the lights were out and Mrs Price was calling to someone
She had screamed something about evil influences and then the lights had gone on
They hadnt gone on
But they must have
They had but wasnt there
had died
Died in the darkness at the seance
What killed me
Shock perhaps
And then what hap pened
Mrs Price had hushed it up
was alone in the city had been buried hurriedly in paupers grave
Heart failure the coroner had probably called it
was laid away
That was it
And yet was Arthur Derwin and surely somebody had cared
Bramin Street said the sign in the lightning
Bramin Street someone had cared Viola
Viola had been my fiancee
She had loved Arthur Derwin
What was her last name
Where had met her
What did she look like
Bramin Street
Again the sign
Unconsciously my feet seemed to have led me down this way
was walking down Bramin Street without thinking in the storm
Very well
would let my feet lead the way
wouldnt think
My feet would take me to Violas home through habit
There would learn
No thinking now
Just walk through the storm
WALKED my eyes closed to the blackness through which thunder beat
walked out of death and was hungry now
was hungry and thirsty here in the night and was hungry to see Viola and thirsty for her lips
had come back from death for her or was that too poetic
came from the grave and went back to sleep in it and rose again and sought the world without memory
It was gruesome and grim and macabre
died at seance
My feet plodded slopping through rain
felt no cold no wet
was warm inside warm with the memory of Viola her lips her hair
She was blonde remembered
Her hair was coiled sunlight her eyes blue and deep as the sea her skin the milky white ness of unicorns flanks
had told her so recalled when had held her in my arms
knew her mouth as STRANGE STORIES scarlet gate to ecstasy
She was the hunger within me she the burning beacon of desire that led me back through mists of memory to her door
was panting and did not know it
Within me revolved wheel that had once been my brain and was now just grinding round screen flashing kaleidoscopic images of Viola of the grave of seance and evil presences and inexplicable death
Viola had been interested in mysticism had been interested in the occult We went to the seance
Mrs Price was famous medium
died at the seance and woke up in grave
came back to see Viola
came back to find out about myself
knew now what was how had died
But how revived
But bow revived
Bramin Street
Feet plodding
And then instinct turned my feet up the pathway to the porch
It was in stinct which caused my hand to fumble for the familiar doorknob without knocking instinct which led me across the threshold
STOOD in hallway deserted hallway
There was mirror there and for the first time could see my self
Perhaps that would shock me into complete remembrance and recogni tion
looked but the mirror faded before my gaze into blur
felt weak dazed
But it was due to the hunger within me the hunger which burned
It was late
Viola wouldnt be downstairs
She would be in her bed room at this hour
went up the stairs dripping water at every step walking quite silently aside from the little dripping patter of rills running down to the stair below
All at once giddiness left me again and felt strong
had the feeling that was ascending the stairs to Des tiny as though once reached the top would know the truth of my fate
Something had brought me from the grave here
Something lay behind this mysterious resurrection
The answer lay above
reached the top turned down the dark familiar hall
The bedroom door opened beneath my hand
candle burned at the bedside nothing more
And saw Viola lying there
She slept incarnate beauty slept
She was very young and lovely at that moment and felt pity for her at what she must know upon awakening
called softly
called softly and while did so my brain said the last of the three questions over and over
And how revived
said my brain
called my voice
She opened her eyes allowed life to flood them
She saw me
Arthur she gasped
Youre dead
It was scream that last
Yes said softly
Why did say Yes
And my brain whispered And how revived
She rose up shuddering
Youre dead ghost
We buried you
Mrs Price was afraid
You died at the seance
Go away Arthur youre dead
She moaned it over and over
looked at her beauty and knew hunger
thousand memories of that last eve ning came to me
The seance and Mrs Price warning of evil spirits the coldness which had gripped me in the darkness and my sudden sinking into oblivion
Then this wakening and my search for Viola to appease my hun ger
Not for food
Not for drink
Not for love
new hunger
new hun ger known only at night new hun ger that made me shun men and forget my former self
new hunger that hated mirrors
hunger for Viola
moved toward her very slowly and my wet graveclothes rustled as reached out my hands reassuringly and took her in my arms
was sorry for her just for an instant then the hunger came stronger and bent my head
The last question rang in my brain once again
And how revived
The seance the threat of evil spirits an swered that question
answered it myself
knew why had risen from the grave and who and what was as took Viola in my arms
took Viola in my arms and my teeth met in her throat
That answered the question
was Vampire
Bottom Pool What the Fisher What the Bait
Martin Aylethorp Plumbs the Depths
Author of Liquid Life Major McCrarys Vision etc
IT WOULD be stupid of me to write this with the intention of saving my life
Of course shall be threatened with murder charge but they shall never be able to pro duce the body
Consequently they must eventually set me free
But there is possibility that may be held for sanity hearing
For that reason must pen this account and attach it to the other papers
It may serve to convince the officials at the in vestigation
And those officials must be convinced
They must be convinced because there is deed which they must do
It is imperative that they heed my plea and board up the bottomless pool in the swamp beyond Prichards Woods
They must board up the pool and drain the bogland fence it off if they cannot destroy it
Otherwise there will be further tragedies this swear is true
And until that black pool is boarded over shall never find the solace of sound sleep but will con RALPH MILNE FARLEY slid feet foremost in to the stygian waters STRANGE STORIES tinue to dream of that thing in the swamp the dark thing that took the life of my friend Martin Aylethorp
There was time when knew peace
Thats the mockery
My friend Martin had been in slump period he wrote for living and invited him East for the sole reason that thought wed find soothing tranquil lity at my home
My cottage is near Mill Brook just outside of Concord
Martin rea soned would enjoy tramping in Prioh ards Woods and in the fall the New England countryside takes on mel low beauty most conducive to easing shattered nerves
AS recall my preparation for his coming it seems like grim joke
was so careful in rigging up his room to insure its quiet even sent into town for noiseless portable to re place my regular typewriter
For when Martin arrived in late Au gust he was sick man
His tall nor mally lean figure was now emaciated his eyes were sunken behind his spec tacles and the smile had remembered as habitual upon his countenance seemed drowned by inward melan choly
He smoked too much and when he held cigarette the gray spirals rose from the tip unevenly because of the trembling of his hand
did my best to conceal my con cern over his changed appearance
He had been working on novel and try ing to hold down librarians job dur ing the day
gathered that he was completely done in and had lately found is impossible to continue with his short story work
It is amazing what creative effort can do to man of Martins peculiar temperament He was drained dry sucked of all vitality as though his nights had been given over to visits from vampire or suc cubus rather than writing
It isnt bad comparison for Martin Aylethorp wrote weird fiction
He wrote it intensely and it was his theory not mine that writing fantasy took more out of an author than work in any other field
His own person certainly seemed to be good proof of this contention
did my best for him
carefully avoided all topics of conversation which might relate to his work
did not show him any of my recent stuff
locked away all my reference books and magazines
And did not allow him to speak of his book
coaxed him into resting argued and bullied him with the notion of getting outdoor exercise interspersed with plenty of sleep
After week or so gradually augented the menu at meal time and encouraged him to eat
It worked
By the time September had passed he had regained his nor mal attitude and his health was once more back to par
Incidentally my self had gained six pounds
Soon proposed series of daily hikes in and about the local woods
Martin took to the idea and for the firt time learned that as boy he had often spent the summer with rela tives in Concord
He seemed eager as his health improved to revisit famil iar landmarks
Although had been at my cottage for over year was amazed at the unsuspected secrets of the countryside he uncovered
Soon he was acting as my guide and played the meekly following visitor to local shrines
As his physical wellbeing increased his normal interests were correspond ingly rearoused
Within several weeks he was talking stories and plots to me again and by the end of the month he was literally champing at the bit eager to get back into harness and do few tales
Although held out as long as could he insisted that he be allowed the use of my typewriter and our daily jaunts were now filled with his talk of proposed work and plans for stories
And then our hikes and his interest converged disastrously
One morning after breakfast he came into my room and yanked me out of my chair
Come on he urged
The suns high and were going for little ex ploring jaunt
Where to
Havent we covered all the local showplaces yet
This is no showplace he replied smiling
Its secret
Ill wager theres spot youve never seen and only mile away from here too
THE BOTTOMLESS POOL doubt that said
What kind of place is it
Martin assumed look of melodra matic grimness
Its called The Bottomless Pool he whispered Whats the gag
Im serious
Its in the swamp south of Prichards Woods
remem ber my gang explored it during one of the summers stayed here as kid
Its strange place George Graves warned us to stay away from it when we told him wed been there
He was the only grownup we ever spoke to about it and it was he who called the place The Bottomless Pool
He mentioned Walden Pond in Concord the place where Thoreau wrote his nature studies you know and said that it was bottomless too
It lies in hollow in the hills has nei ther inlet nor outlet yet the water is always fresh
Springs and subter ranean river cause that no doubt the glacier created some queer freaks hereabouts
But he said that Govern ment engineers once came to Walden to take soundings and there were spots in that pond that were deeper than their longest soundingwires
Thats what he meant by bottomless pool and he said that the one in Prichards Woods was similar
Well his warning just whetted our interest in the spot you see
Kids are like that guess
We got together all the fishline the gang could lay their hands on and tied it all together with lead weight on one end
Then we lowered it down into that sluggish black pool in the swamp
We never struck bottom
Well that sort of scared us its creepy place and we took the warning more seriously
never have gone back
That was my last summer at Concord and gradually lost track of the boys
But did hear something in letter once about Sam Dewey disappearing in the swamp the following year
Sam was the lad who suggested we take sound ings
Of course dont think his dis appearance had anything to do with his interest in the Bottomless Pool although it might have at that
He was foolhardy and George Graves when warning us hinted something about people who had fallen in
listened to all this with sort of tepid interest
But Martin seemed genuinely enthusiastic
Lets go take look at the place he urged
Its really weird spot and Ive got hunch theres story there somewhere
rose and obediently put on my boots
In my own solitary wanderings had avoided the mucky wooded depths of the old swamp and it was only to humor my guest that acceded to his request We struck out to the south and soon reached the swamp edge
rprfE swamp was awful
The limbs of dead trees interred the sun light and only the wan ghosts of its beams haunted the murky avenues of the morass
Rotten logs and slimy creepers covered slough of quick sand and bog through which floun dered at Martins heels
The instincts of boyhood guided him aright so that he avoided the gray bubbling patches of deeper ooze
He remarked over this voicing his amazement that after all these years the place seemed to be unchanged
At first it was the physical difficul ties we encountered which impressed me
Gradually however as we waded deeper into the dark swamp became more aware of other less tangible things
The place looked like death and smelled of deaths rottenness and decay
Moss and fungoid growths clung to the gray treetrunks bloated toadstools reared pulpy deaths heads on fat stemmed necks rising from the ooze
The bubbling of the swampjuices beneath our boots was silent kind of sound or rather noise that seemed to intensify the silence and at the same time to be part of it
There was no wind in the hanging branches and we saw neither bird nor animal in these depths
Still there had been life here once for we soon struck rickety old fence which wound in seemingly haphaz ard manner through the lower swamp
STRANGE STORIES Martin beckoning to me turned and followed the meandering wooden out lines until he came to the willow tree that bent over the ground before it
And there in the deep dark shade of the ancient boughs lay the Bottomless Pool
It was small barely six feet across and black
Jet black water motion less
The pool was like large un blinking eye with an odious green scum filming its pupil
Thats highly fantastic comparison but something about the pools ap pearance inspired such thoughts in me
It was strange and somehow unnatu ral
It wasnt right for this small pool to be here in the swamp and certainly the thing looked as evil as any natural formation Ive ever seen
MARTIN stood looking into the depths for few moments
The waters black too he murmured strange how in the presence of si lence the human voice is always hushed
The waters black as ink he said
And he dipped one hand into the pool brushing off the scummy froth and cupping ebon drops for me to see
The water was black and the decayed matter in it gave it veined appear ance it was striated with dark green rills
Place eery enough for you
asked Martin
Scared us when we were kids he observed
And wouldnt be too sure of my reactions now
But what set ting for story
had been staring into the silent water and now wondered what was generating the impulse in me to turn and run away
Were my own nerves bad
hastily averted my gaze
Martin shouted
He really spoke in normal tone of voice but in contrast to our previous hushed mur murs it was shout
Look at the lizard he exclaimed
Sure enough the surface of the black water had parted with widening rip ple and small dark lizard of some sort appeared
It floated on its back as though dead
reached down and grabbed it yanked it out
Why theres wire attached to it
The wire led down into the water
Just then there came pull on the line from within the pool
It yanked the little dead reptile right out of my hands but something attached to it caught in my coat cut right through it and dug painfully into my side
Im caught
cried as stepped toward the pfcl to ease the pain of the barb in my side
But now the wire line had tightened was drawing me in short jerks toward the brink of the black pool
grabbed the line with both hands braced my feet at the very edge and leaned backward
But the sod on which was standing crumbled and slid feet foremost into the Sty gian water
Martin leaped forward and grabbed me
With tremendous tug he hurled me back on the bank
Water coursed down my body and warm blood scalded the deep wound in my side
felt faint
Martin swore softly as he daubed iodine on the cut beneath my shirt and swore loudly at the pain
Neither of us were ready to comment but sud denly Martin turned his head and darted again to the edge of the pool
He pointed speechless
Another lizard larger than the first now rose to the surface of the pool
It bobbed and seemed to beckon
Martin scowled deeply pointed to my hookgashed side and growled out single word Bait
What bait
The lizard
snorted disgustedly
But ah the way home we marveled at the incident
We argued as changed into dry garments debated as bandaged my side mused during luncheon and speculated wildly all the long afternoon
Martin ever the imaginative had dozen fantastic theories
Who fished at the depths of the bot tomless pool
And with hooks
Some thing lived in the pool
Maybe some things
The somethings fished for men
As boy hadnt George Graves THE BOTTOMLESS POOL hinted about disappearances
And hadnt Sam Dewey vanished near the swamp
SOMETHING in the pool set traps for men putting lizards on hooks and using wire line
The Bot tomless Pool led to inner earth and there was life below
Thus Martin expressed himself halfseriously
To which offered the obvious re plies
The hook and line had been used by some fisherman
It had fallen into the water
Perhaps the lizard had been accidentally impaled upon the hook risen to the surface as it died and brought the line up
grabbed it got hooked and snag entangling the lines end under water had pulled me into the pool
But what about the second lizard we saw
Martin insinuated gently
was silent
Martin was grave for moment be fore continuing
remember as boy fishing for pickerel up Assabet
The boat rocked
was only about nine at the time but was smart fisher man
hooked big pickerel that day and the pickerel hooked me
gave him an uncomprehending glance
Line got wrapped around my foot and the fish pulled me out of the boat he laughed
Then in graver tones he went on If were fish and wanted to catch fisherman Id tangle him up in line
Take the Bot tomless Pool for example
If meant to capture whoever or whatever is fish ing for me from below Id grab that lizard bait and allow it to drag me in toward the pool
Then Id pull up more line and attach the wire to windlass rope
And then Id let go of the hook
The sudden release might precipitate the fisherman below over board into the water and tangle him up
Then by quickly winding in the windlass Id haul the fellow up to the surface
But thats absurd began
Theres no fisherman in the Bottomless Pool there cant be and besides How does your hooked side feel this evening
interjected Martin sar castically
Oh lets forget it grumbled
But didnt forget
dreamed that night
And Martin did not forget either
He spent the midnight hours at the typewriter taking notes for story
Neither of us however spoke again of the Bottomless Pool
The next day awoke with slight fever
The wound in my side was little inflamed and lay abed bath ing it with hot cloths to reduce the swelling
Martin after assuring him self that was not utterly helpless announced that he was going for walk
Id like to interview few old timers around here about that place he told me
There should be myths
forget what remark made but know that tried to laugh him out of his interest
Secretly was very much disturbed
My dreams had not been pleasant and the Bottomless Pool had figured rather too prominently in them
For moment had the wild notion that Martin was going off to try out his fishing theory
He seemed almost unnaturally interested per son of his temperament can be greatly influenced by imaginative concepts
He left on his purported mission of investigation and spent long day in dozing and dreaming
It was late afternoon when he returned greeted me brusquely and went in to the other room
In few moments heard the vibration of the noiseless typewriter
Rising got supper together
We ate but little fever had banished my own appetite and excitement seemed to grip Martin so that food could not interest him
Almost as soon as he sat down he launched into long babble of gossip he had picked up during the day
Old Bert Pickens down near the Cause way had known Martins parents he had filled my friend up with old Colonial tales and even some Indian lore hed heard as boy back in the seventies
There were stories about the swamp south of the woods specific cases of disappearances dating way back as far as community memory went
Visiting Granny Mercers cottage later in the day Martin had persuaded the always garrulous old woman to re STRANGE STORIES count her own family history
It was point of pride with the crone that her pure blood had at one time pro duced martyr during the Salem witchcraft hysteria and she warned Martin most gravely about the old pool
It was from her that he picked up his tale of the Indian rites in the swamp where the braves sometimes offered up sacrifices to the pitgod they believed dwelt in the pool cast ing bodies into the orifice
could see that Martin was more impressed with this lore than even he admitted he was very glib in patching together his yarn so that it formed an almost recognizable story sequence
He quoted from memory the words of Cotton Mather concerning gateways to Hell and openings in earth which lead to the Regions of the Damned
Indeed he weaved fine romance about the pool and did it so deftly that was forced to the conclusion that he halfbelieved some of it
Ill write it all up tonight he told me
Then must have another look at the place
You know theres some thing fascinating about all this its real mystery
Wouldnt it be remark able if there is some truth about my theories concerning the fishing
After all those lizards dont manufacture hook and wire
And some of these old wives tales are very definite
made no comment
went to bed early leaving Martin to type away in the next room as he had planned
My sleep was troubled and it must have been about midnight when woke in cold sweat and stumbled into the kitchen for water
The house was dark and still
passed through Mar tins room and noticed with start that his bed was empty
Fever left me
knew with an in explicable dread that Martin had gone
And knew too where he had gone
My first thought was that had overestimated his recovery
He might still be mentally ill the pool in the swamp had exercised morbid fasci nation on his mind
Poor judgment might have led him to see the thing by moonlight for the sake of captur ing story atmosphere
went back to bed but did not sleep
kept waiting for him to re turn
The night was long
trem bled with fever and with secret fear
It was not good thing to wander alone in the swamp by night
Quick sand and fog to say nothing of the possibilities of running into some prowler made the stunt dangerous
But after an hour had passed found that it was not this spectacle of actual apparent dangers which dis turbed me
began to think only of the pool itself and of the bait upon its black surface
Then it was that unreasoning panic gripped me
rose and bundled up tugged on my boots
snatched up my belt flashlight and ran out
SWEAR had no sense of time passing on my nocturnal trek in the woods
It seemed only fever filled instant before was already wading into that black jungle fring ing the swamp only mistwrapped moment before darted from hum mock to hummock in the rising fog calling Martins name
Only the frogs croaked an answer
Then was following the fencerail and finally grasped the willow trunk as stared down at the bank of the pool the bank of wet mud in which were implanted the fresh bootprints of human feet
They faced one way only toward the pool
And as they neared the edge they slurred into sort of sliding scoopedout impres sion as though the wearer had been dragged
Dragged into the black silent water from which the tiny bubbles now arose slowly slowly
screamed and ran back into the night
Fever held me the next day
But was glad for it kept me from think ing too much thinking about what had happened and also about what planned to do
didnt consider the possibility of suicide not when read the typed notes Martin had written the night be fore
The whole story of his belief lay there and there were incredible hints of what he expected to bring THE BOTTOMLESS POOL forth from the pool depths
At the last he spoke of the urge to revisit the scene and capture lizard for ex amination to see if it were of rec ognizable species and also to deter mine just how it had been killed
He wanted some wire also and one of the hooks
Then he would go ahead and try his plan
For he quite definitely had intended to use the windlass trick
learned that before the morning was over the delivery truck brought the order from the city
went sick as signed Martins name for the shipment
had sud den vision of him on the night be fore standing by the pool as he waited for the appearance of the bait then stooping to remove the reptile and being caught dragged
No it was not suicide
It was mur der
But by what means
Through burning delirium came the answer pictures conjured up from Indian legends and witchcraft whis perings
Dweller beneath the waters fishing for humankind and snaring the curious
fissure in the earths crust leading to some hellish subterranean cavern
And Martin go ing down down into the inky waters on the end of hook to be seized by what
would find out
The windlass and Martins scheme he would be avenged with his own plan his own instru ment
must have been little mad
talked and laughed to myself great deal as the day sped
gathered the equipment together at dusk and started for the swamp
An unhealthy nightfog was already rising when left Prichards Woods but though fever coursed through my veins plodded on
walked through night mare
The unseen frogs croaked dismal litany as stumbled through the bog
Tapers of fog rose dimly on all sides and smoky mist hung about my head
floundered through the gray dark ness lugging the windlass
Often sank ankledeep into puddles of bub bling slime
All about me in the night was rot tenness and decay and death and re call thinking that this putrescent swamp was but frame background setting for the black jewel of the bottomless pit
But the fog and the fever in my temples accounted for such wild fancies
Fog and fever conspired toward my feeling of unutterable loathing when first caught sight of the ebon waters upon the inky chasm in the center of the swamp
Fog and fever addled me so that monotonously cursed as anchored the windlass to big log set upon the firm higher ground of the bank
short rope from the drum of the windlass ran to the edge of the pool and ended in quicksettling clamp
There was detached part of me that carried out these operations with methodical precision and yet another part that inspired my cursings as crouched there in the forest darkness of the heaving breathing swamp
BENEATH my feet the quicksand thrummed and groaned and re call that wild picture rose in my mind
had fantastic image of my self crouching upon the epidermis of some gigantic monster as though the swamp itself were just the skin of vast beast and the bottomless black pit tiny pinprick in the flesh
But that too was fog and fever
The preparations were made
had not even glanced at the scummy sur face of the pool so sure was of what my eyes must encounter
Now with the drum ready for use and the wind lass securely placed gazed into the dark depths and jerked on the flash light wore at my belt
Its rays disclosed the floating blue body of tiny lizard bobbing monoto nously upon the surface of the cryptic waters
There it lay in death rising and sinking upon water that did not move
And that fact inspired me with the terrible fear of corroboration for poor Martins story
stared at the creature fighting the fog and fever that created gray mist upon my brain until the only thought distinguishable was panic impulse to STRANGE STORIES flee the spot
rocked on my heels when wished to run screaming back across the bog to spot where Nature is sane and friendly
And then felt in my pocket for the wireclipper had found on Martins desk
For some absurd reason the cold feel of the prosaic factorycut metal reassured me
And with my free hand reached out and snatched at the blue lizard
tugged the body from the water in the beam of the flashlight on the bank and the clear yellow beam was cut by black line
The lizard was wired
Seizing the clamp next to me quickly clipped the wire to the windlass rope
Then yanked on the wire with both hands
shudder ran through me for felt dreadful unmistakable response from the other end of the line
Through the water it tightened jerked
SOMEONE below was pulling on the rope
Someone was fishing
But who
And from how far below
The tugger was strong
In sudden desperation felt my heels slide along the bank
Powerful jerks were draw ing me close to the black brink of that dark still pool
With gasp let go
The line whipped back into the water
In my minds eye formed silly senseless picture of fisherman standing on his wharf then falling over backwards as the catch released his line
An idiotic picture it was for there could be no fisherman at the bottom of bottomless pool
Or could there be
would soon know
The line fell back then reached the spot where had clamped it to the windlass rope
There it snapped taut
The fisherman had fallen overboard
He had been hooked
laughed with out mirth at the insane thought
And then gripped the windlass handle and turned the drum and felt terrific threshing tauten the line until it stood straight in the flash lights beam again
The wire began to snap back and forth in the black waters of thi
turned and turned hundred thousand revolu tions were made in augmenting frenzy for now desperately realized that each crank was bringing me closer and closer to the secret of the bottomless pool
Suddenly the winch jammed
stared in dismay then saw that the drum was full
Then leapt in front of the windlass and grabbed the re maining wire in my hands
It took second but experienced year
Through fever and fog came images of what might expect to find at the end of my line
Martins bloated corpse blue and swollen with the line gripped between death clenched teeth
the shapeless body of child long mired in the slime of the pit
But no it could not be
There was fisher down there fisher that baited cunningly this hook and sent wire line upwards to entrap children and wanderers and curious men
And the fisher had taken Martin and was now entangled in this line
fisher in black and bottomless pool was drawing in fisher from Below
The rays of the flashlight on the bank now gleamed upon the surface of the scummy waters but they were still no longer
In oozing eddies they bubbled and swirled and black slime was tossed upwards as drew th cut ting wire through my hands
ter rific force was pulling against me and fright alone conspired to intensify the strength of my grip
At that moment would gladly have released my hold but sheer hysteria made my muscles rigid
Slowly inexorably drew the final length of the wire from the water in the yellow light
The Fisher emerged
cannot remember if screamed aloud but there was the sound made by utter fear ringing and crashing against my brain
For saw the crea ture of the pit saw the strangled neck about which the tangling wire had wound and allowed me to pull the Fisher upwards
saw what filled the sixfoot surface of the pool as it emerged
It was head shaped by horrors dreams alone
Not human not rep tilian not froglike it was neverthe THE BOTTOMLESS POOL less featured with great staring yellow eyes snouted like saurian and cov ered with greenish batrachoid skin that glistened slickly against the yel low light
The monstrous bulging eyes rolled wildly and dilated in agony as the creature opened its great slitted mouth in soundless choking gasp
stared into red maw that was fanged in manner unknown to any beast still roaming earth and as did so sickening realization swept over me
This was the Fisher
An instant only did that gigantic glistening head rise greenly above the waters of the pool then my clippers were out the wire snapped with shrill twang and the Fisher from Be low sank beneath the bubbling black waves with thunderous splash of slime
stared down blankly into the depths as the waters quickly became quiescent once again
could see nothing but did not wish to
did not wish to learn what man ner of horrid life flourished unnatu rally at the bottom of this opening wherever that bottom might be
did not care to speculate upon the cun ning intelligence of primal entity which even now fished for men from its lair in the black deep
did not think could endure surmises which now clamored for consideration
Was this the only creature of its kind or were there more down there
What inversion of sane natural laws allowed existence in nighted depths and what manner of ghastly intelli gence prompted prehistoric beasts to set bait for men
Were there other such openings in the earths conceal ing crust through which the madness below had access to humanity
But what most devoutly tried to keep from thinking about was the scraped sides of the poolbank and the reasons for it
Only the head of the monster had emerged and it had filled the pool
The sides were scraped by the shoulders and the six foot pool bad not been wide enough to permit the passage of the body
Fog and fever were merciful re leases
know that dumped the windlass in the pool and it sank like plummet and dimly remember running back through the swamp
EWAS ill the next few days and then the police came and told them what dared
They have seen the pool but they have said nothing of their opinion to me
told them more today and will tell them all know soon not to preserve my free dom but because now want the spot boarded up
It must be lest others see the bait It must be boarded up for it cannot be filled up
shall tell them soon or let them read this
They can think me de mented if they like but trust they believe enough to act and act promptly
Perhaps if even then they do not believe may show them the hook have tre hook from the wire in the pool which cut off
hate to reveal it to them for detest the very memory of the thing myself
It is made of some golden metal harder than pure gold
It is cut and rudely shaped and dislike to con ceive of the creatures who deliber ately formed it for its horrid purpose and made the wire to which it was attached
cannot bear to think of the civilization behind such creative effort
And worst of all is the memory of those designs in the metal
Those designs created by what primal artist
There are three of them cut into the gold surface
They tell all so that know only too well why the Fishers seek men with bait from their bottomless pits
The first design is tiny like the rest but it unmistakably depicts creature such as the one whose head saw
dare not describe the body which is shown here
But the creature is bait ing hook
The second little design is crude representation of man falling through water at the end of line as Martin must have fallen
And the third design but must not speak of that tells of what Mar tins fate was tells why the Fishers fish
That third hellish design on the hookl It shows feast
The Bottomless Pool must be boarded up

IT WAS not dream
Despite the fact that she had distinctly re membered going to bed as last conscious effort after the stormy in terview with Artemus Eusso Mar jorie Westbrook knew as she had known about other weird instances in her life that this was stark and cold reality
There was no state of transition between the pleasant business of re tiring and this instinct awareness of an incredible situation
Simply she had gone to bed in her lovely cham ber at home in Forest Hills as Mar jorie Westbrook heiress to the Westbrook Motor millions her mind filled with business details over the present policies of the late George Westbrooks automobile factories
And here she was wide awake and standing before an altar in front of her an altar of ancient Egyptian motif with the sacred ibis projecting in relief at the ends like figureheads of ships
She stood in her bare feet upon cold floor of tesselated marble
More over the satin nightdress the last item of dress she remembered don ning was gone
She stood there in complete nudity but she was con scious of no sense of shame or mod esty
Without seeing it for she was powerless to turn she was aware of an immensity of space which ex Tie crystal ball turned inky black tended in all directions behind her space blocked out with intangible green mist that was almost black and almost of the density of velvet drapes At her right hand was an upright sarcophagus with the lid removed
Within the musty and spicily pun gent interior was the wrapped figure of mummy mummy which queerly enough was headless
It was all like closing her eyes upon scene in cinema for an in stant to open them upon sudden change of locale
With this signifi FULFILLMENT cant difference there was no con tinuity no relevance no congruity no connection between her life and this grotesque pattern
There were of course her previous experiences those strange uncanny interludes in her otherwise prosaic life
But there was no tangi ble connection unless you considered the sarcophagus which looked ex actly like the one she had purchased some months before even to the headless mummy in the musty in terior
Somehow and Marjorie could not explain it that sarcophagus which should have been in her boudoir was here with her in this other world
That Egyptian sarcophagus as soon as she had seen it she had been re solved to possess it
Its fascination for her had been but the apex of an amazing sequence of bizarre oc currences and it blended as perfect complement with those ex periences
Marjorie now became aware that just beyond the altar before which she stood was the figure of man in cowled crimson robe his hands busy at set of dials and buttons before him
And the craziest and most outre part of it all was the monks face
He was Art emus Russo general manager of Westbrook Mo tors
Yet there was strangeness about him that was not Russo
Before she had time to cry out to question him to demand an explana tion Marjorie noticed the light
She was outlined in glow of light like psychic aura of unbelievable in tensity shading from pure white to garish green mantling her in bath of living light
As she stared down at her lovely form to her horror she saw the flesh become translucent transparent and finally invisible and the skeletal structure of her body from neck to toe became hide ously revealed in glowing pink
Still bound by invisible chains which kept her motionless but with out pain Marjorie heard the cowled figure speak and the tones of his voice awakened thousand memories in her mind memories which were not of the welltailored Artemus Russo who shouted so irately about proxies and assets and common stock of Westbrook Motors Inc The hour has come Princess he said to fulfill your destiny
she gasped giving him name which came easily from her lips
am not ready
Her own answer startled her pro foundly shook her to the depths of her soul
That was what made these bizarre occurrences in her life so distressing
It implied knowledge on her part of monstrous things from the womb of time about which she as Marjorie Westbrook should have known noth ing
But she did know
Even now answering so easily to the title of princess yet aware of herself as Marjorie Westbrook she remem bered similar experiences
THE first had happened when she was child of ten
Without warn ing she had passed from safely mundane world to shadowy temple of vast halls and towering pillars
Going to bed all tired out from day of happy play falling quickly asleep suddenly she was standing before high altar whose sides were frieze of jackalheaded dolls of angular lines
Or were they dolls
How was little girl of ten to know
Yet they were not strange to her
Without knowing how she knew she was as familiar with the symbol of Anubis as she was with her own sis ter the twin who had always walked beside her
With start she realized that another little girl was standing with her before that forbidding altar with its plume of curling incense
The little companion was an exact duplicate of herself dressed in archaic headdress and queerly draped robe of costly silk with beaten gold design in the hem
On her ankles and arms bracelets glittered one in the form of coiled serpent with eyes of emerald green
This was Isames
Without being told Marjorie knew that her own name was Isira
It had always been Isira for ten years of Egyptian childhood as princess of the royal STRANGE STORIES blood
There was no Marjorie West brook in this consciousness and yet she knew she was Marjorie West brook and that Sir Gerwain was wait ing for her out in her fathers ken nels
In way it was terrifying and Marjorie Isira whimpered
Be brave Isira whispered Isa mes
It is our heritage
Before Marjorie could reply there was movement behind the altar and Ankhtares high priest of Ammon cold and stern man with the features of Artemus Russo her fathers secre tary swam into view
There was strange light in his piercing black eyes as he looked out and down upon the two little girls who stood before the altar to the dead tightly clasp ing each others hands
Princess Isira and Princess Isa mes he spoke in sonorous voice which echoed hollowly through the great hall of the temple in accord ance with the rule of your house blessed under the sign of the cruK ansata and dedicated to the service of Ra you are here to choose your destiny
Are you prepared
We are prepared Ankhtares Marjorie heard herself and her sister reply
That the language was not modern English she did not even note
The high priest passed his hand above the curling incense rising from the altar in cabalistic sign and blue smoke fairly boiled up in writh ing convolutions that had sparks of incandescent red
The figure of the high priest was obscured for mo ment and both little girls trembled
Then he came back into view
In this the third era in the sec ond dynasty of Ptolemy his com pelling voice rolled out it is writ ten in the Seventh Book of Anubis that of twin princes or princesses of the direct line of Pharaoh only one can ascend to the throne
Herein lies the parting paths of destiny
For one there is the sceptre of queen wealth and glory and power and death before her youth has faded
For the other there is timeless void until her spirit shall find life and happiness in future existence and then she shall grow old before her time
And in the end the twain shall be reunited by bond far stronger than that of natal ties
It is so writ ten
Choose well ye little princesses
Behold the sacred ibis awaits to carry the word to Ammon Giver of all
Both little girls clung together and quivered in wideeyed fright as they saw the blue smoke take the form of the sacred bird
The words of the high priest were incomprehen sible to them but they stared at the shadowy bird of Ra and spoke bravely
want to be queen said Isa mes
want to be happy said Isira
With puff of smoke the nebu lous ibis disappeared
So be it
said the voice of Ankh tares
There was flash of blinding light and little Marjorie Westbrook opened her eyes to find the looming sun streaming in at the window and to hear the excited yelping of Sir Ger wain her wolfhound outside
That had happened when she was ten
Now at twentyfive in the very midst of undergoing similar ex perience she was able to recall that earlier one
SHE stared down in mounting sort of mental fear as she watched her body entirely disappear from be neath her leaving only the faintly glowing frame of her bony struc ture
And as she watched even that began to fade away in the bath of terrible light the source of which she could not determine
Soon she would be disembodied head floating above the strange floor
The hour is at hand Princess Isira said the cowled priest for the fulfillment of your destiny
The sands of time have run their inter minable course
Beyond human com prehension is the working of the Infi nite
You behold on your right the sarcophagus of Isames queen of the Nile taken unto the arms of Anubis and Thoth in her twentysixth year
Alas only her chu preserved body remains
Her ka soul bird with hu man head has departed for the sun FULFILLMENT temple of Amraon Her sacred crypt was violated by Vandals and dese crators of the dead but you can be hold her likeness on the lid of the sarcophagus in beaten gold
Marjorie Westbrook or the con sciousness that was Marjorie West brook stared at the cover of the ornate case and nearly swooned in astonishment She recalled the face on the lid of her own sarcophagus the one in her boudoir and how its haunting familiarity had puzzled arid intrigued her
But always it bad remained vague and dim
Now like the sensitized image on print that has just been withdrawn from de veloping fluid the golden features bathed in that eerie glow were exact duplicates of her own
It was as though she stared into burnished mirror of gold
Even the wide star ing eyes seemed alive with the color and expression of her own eyes
And still this fantastic this outre and bizarre experience was no dream
Majorie Westbrook was as thor oughly awake as she would ever be
Never since that soulshaking and impossible thing which had happened to her at the age of ten had she ex perienced awake or asleep any fur ther manifestation which included so much as mention of the lost Isames
In her nocturnal materializations and there had been at least one for every year of her life she had never again seen this strange twin sister or heard of her until now
It came to Marjorie with dreadful thrill that she was in her own twentysixth year right now
Not once during her entire life had she ever mentioned these weird ad ventures to anyone not even to her doctor
It was closed and sealed book from the world from even Mar jorie herself except in the throes of the fantastic episodes
But it was not dream life she knew that
It was some horrible destiny an actual and solid fate of terrific force and dim unguessed purpose that stalked her
And it did not feed solely upon the hours of night mere figment of her imagination
There was that day when she was seventeen and her father had taken her to the county fair
Normal happy lighthearted girl of modern age she had clapped her hands in delight when the old Gipsy hag in the gaycolored booth wanted to tell her fortune
But no sooner had Marjorie seated herself across the table of sand from the woman than the crystal ball thereon turned inky black
The woman started in utter dismay and quickly flung cloth over the ball
She blanched almost white as she stared with her sharp black eyes into Marjories blue ones
Let me see your right hand she said in tense whisper
Obligingly Marjorie stretched out her slim and girlish hand palm up
Without touching her the Gipsy stared with bulging eyes her golden earrings adance with violent agita tion
No she whispered
No no cannot read your destiny child
But that isnt fair pouted Mar jorie
Ive paid you silver dollar
You must read my fortune
Here is your money said the old woman beginning to shake all over
wont have it back declared Marjorie defiantly
Keep it and read my fortune
rairiE Gipsy groaned
cannot she articulated with difficulty
dare not
see only that you have double existence
You will grow old before your time incredibly old
How old
demanded Marjorie thinking the Gipsy was putting on very good act
Perhaps perhaps six thousand years choked out the other and then with wild cry the woman fled from the booth
That experience had taken place in broad daylight had occurred to Mar jorie Westbrook without any transi tion into another entity another sphere of life
So she knew she was not crazy
And she knew she did not dream these yearly episodes which wove that strange irrelevant and inexplicable pattern through her STRANGE STORIES otherwise normal and sane existence
she cried out in horror now against dread of she knew not what as her skeleton completely dis appeared
But her protests were as naught to this high priest of Ammon who was the counterpart of Artemus Russo
And Marjorie became aware of pair of hands cold and clammy as early morning fog off the Sound which gripped her head
She rolled her eyes to see greengray figure that had materialized behind her dis embodied spirit that was human only in outline an elemental even an ectoplasmic projection of Ankhtares
She opened her mouth to scream in terror but no sound came
She thought she was in silent world of chimeras
And the creature carried her bodyless head like football across the intervening space and set it firmly on the shoulders of the linenwrapped mummy within the sarcophagus
Thy destiny has been fulfilled came the voice of Ankhtares
At last we shall both have peace
There was that blinding flash of light which Marjorie Westbrook had come to know so well and every thing went into the oblivion of noth ingness
MARJORIE opened her eyes
The maid was letting in the sunshine
She was safe at home in her own bed in Forest Hills the covers drawn snugly up to her chin
Miss Westbrook said the maid softly it is eleven oclock
Mr Russo is waiting to see you in the sitting room
He insisted that wake you as he has to attend that board meeting
He said he must have your final word
Marjorie smiled
Her personal re lief was so great that she felt in most melting mood toward the man ager of her affairs
Very well she said
Tell him am ready to sign those proxies for him and wind things up
Wait help me up first
She threw back the silken coverlet preparatory to sitting up
Bring over the She broke off in stunned horror
As she moved it sounded like the rattling of parchment and dried bones
As she tossed back the cover instead of satin night negligee from Paris upon the lovely body of twentyfiveyearold beauty she ex posed the graybrown and dried skin of an Egyptian mummy
Her hands were two shrunken claws the outline of the bones showing plainly from elbow to fingers
One terrible shriek Marjorie West brook gave ere death overtook her
The horrible episodes of her noc turnal life had finally broken through the barrier that had always sur rounded and protected her had over taken her at last
The six thousand years were up
The maid stared petrified at the lovely head perfectly joined to that of the sixthousandyearold mummy of an Egyptian woman
Her eyes rolled wildly to corner of the room where her mistress prized sarcopha gus stood and she screamed
The lid was off and the headless mummy that should have reposed in the case was gone
Mr Russo
she cried as she fled to the outer room
Her voice choked cut off abruptly as she stared at the couch where she had left the general manager sitting
Ly ing fulllength on the couch was Arte mus Russo his body as still as death and his face parchment yellow and amazingly horribly wrinkled with lines that told of the passage of cen turies

heard sickening crunch and saw one of the bells smash down on Sarto Bells of Horror By KEITH HAMMOND Author of The Hand of Ahrimana
The Invaders etc
Then star nor sun shall waken Nor any change of light Nor sound of waters shaken Nor any sound or sight Nor wintry leaves nor vernal Nor days nor things diurnal Only the sleep eternal In an eternal night
GREAT deal of curiosity has been aroused by the strange affair of the lost bells of Mis sion San Xavier
Many have wondered why when the bells were discovered after remaining hidden for over hundred and fifty years they were al most immediately smashed and the fragments buried secretly
In view of the legends of the remarkable tone and quality of the bells number of musicians have written angry letters asking why at least they were not rung before their destruction and permanent record made of their music
As matter of fact the bells were rung and the cataclysmic thing that STRANGE STORIES happened at that time was the direct reason for their destruction
And when those evil bells were shrieking out their mad summons in the unprece dented blackness that shrouded San Xavier it was only the quick action of one man that saved the world yes do not hesitate to say it from chaos and doom
As secretary of the California His torical Society was in position to witness the entire affair almost from its inception
was not present of course when the bells were unearthed but Arthur Todd the president of the society telephoned me at my home in Los Angeles soon after that illfated discovery
He was almost too excited to speak coherently
Weve found them
he kept shouting
The bells Ross
Found them last night back in the Pinos Range
Its the most remarkable discovery since since the Rosetta Stone
What are you talking about
asked groping in fog of drowsiness
The call had brought me from my warm bed
The San Xavier bells of course he explained jubilantly
Ive seen them myself
Just where Junipero Serra buried them in
hiker found cave in the Pinos and ex plored it and there was rotting wooden cross at the end with carving on it
brought What did the carving say
broke in
Oh just minute have it here
Listen Let no man hang the evil bells of the Mutsunes which lie buried here lest the terror of the night rise again in Nueva California
The Mutsunes you know were sup posed to have had hand in casting the bells
know said into the transmit ter
Their shamans were supposed to have put magic spell on them
Im Im wondering about that Todd said
There have been some very unusual things happening up here
Ive only got two of the bells out of the cave
Theres another you know but the Mexicans wont go in the cave any more
They say well theyre afraid of something
But Ill get that bell if have to dig it up my self
Want me to come up there
If you will Todd said eagerly
Im phoning from cabin in Coyote Canyon
left Denton my assistant in charge
Suppose send boy down to San Xavier to guide you to the cave
All right assented
Send him to the Xavier Hotel
Ill be there in few hours
SAN XAVIER is perhaps hun dred miles from Los Angeles
raced along the coast and within two hours had reached the little mission town hemmed in by the Pinos Range drowsing sleepily on the edge of the Pacific
found my guide at the hotel but he was oddly reluctant to return to Todds camp
can tell you how to go Senor
You will not get lost
The boys dark face was unnaturally pale beneath its heavy tan and there was lurking dis quiet in his brown eyes
dont want to go back jingled some coins
Its not as bad as all that is it
Afraid of the dark
He flinched
Si the the dark its very dark in that cave Senor
The upshot was that had to go alone trusting to his directions and mv own ability in the open
Dawn was breaking as started up the canyon trail but it was strangely dark dawn
The sky was not overcast but it held curious gloom
have seen such oppressively dark days dur ing dust storms but the air seemed clear enough
And it was very cold although even from my height could see no fog on the Pacific
kept on climbing
Presently found myself threading the gloomy chill recesses of Coyote Canyon
shivered with cold
The sky was dull leaden color and found myself breathing heavily
In good physical condition the climb had tired me un duly
Yet was not physically tired it was rather an aching oppressive leth argy of mind
My eyes were watering and found myself shutting them occasionally to relieve the strain BELLS OF HORROR wished the sun would come over the top of the mountain
Then sawsomething extraordinary and horrible
It was toad gray fat ugly
It was squatting beside rock at the side of the trail rubbing itself against the rough stone
One eye was turned toward me or rather the place where the eye should have been
There was no eye there was only slimy little hollow
The toad moved its ungainly body back and forth sawing its head against the rock
It kept uttering harsh little croaks of pain and in moment it had withdrawn from the stone and was dragging itself across the trail at my feet
stood looking at the stone nause ated
The gray surface of rock was bedaubed with whitish streaks of fetor and the shredded bits of the toads eye
Apparently the toad had deliberately ground out its protruding eyes against the rock
It crept out of sight beneath bush leaving track of slime in the dust of the trail
involuntarily shut my eyes and rubbed them and suddenly jerked down my hands startled at the rough ness with which my fists had been dig ging into my eyesockets
Lancing pain shot through my temples
Re membering the itching burning sen sation in my eyes shuddered little
Had the same sort of torture caused the toad deliberately to blind itself
My God
RAN on up the trail
Presently passed cabin probably the one from which Todd had telephoned for saw wires running from the roof to tall pine
knocked at the door
No answer
continued my ascent
Suddenly there came an agonized scream knifeedged and shrill and the rapid thudding of footsteps
stopped listening
Someone was run ning down the trail toward me and behind him could hear others racing shouting as they ran
Around bend in the trail man came plunging
He was Mexican and his black stubbled face was set in lines of ter ror and agony
His mouth was open in square of agony and insane screams burst horribly from his throat
But it wasnt that that sent me stag gering back out of his path cold sweat bursting out on my body
His eyes had been gouged out and twin trickles of blood dripped down his face from black gaping hollows
As it happened there was no need for me to halt the blinded mans fran tic rush
At the curve of the trail he smashed into tree with frightful force and momentarily stood upright against the trunk
Then very slowly he sagged down and collapsed in limp huddle
There was great splotch of blood on the rough bark
went over to him quickly
Four men came running toward me
recognized Arthur Todd and Den ton his assistant
The other two were obviously laborers
Todd jerked to halt
Good God is he dead
Swiftly he bent over to examine the unconscious man
Denton and stared at each other
Denton was tall stronglybuilt man with shock of black hair and broad mouth that was generally expanded in grin
Now his face bore look of horrified disbelief
God Ross he did it right before our eyes Denton said through pale lips
He just let out scream threw up his hands and tore his eyes out of their sockets
He shut his own eyes at the memory
Todd got up slowly
Unlike Den ton he was small wiry nervously energetic with lean brown face and amazingly alert eyes
Dead he said
Whats happened
asked trying to keep my voice steady
Whats wrong Todd
Was the man insane
And all the while had picture of that fat toad tearing out its eyes against rock
Todd shook his head his brows drawn together in frown
dont know
Ross do your eyes feel odd
shiver ran through me
Damned odd
Burning and itching
Ive been rubbing them continually on the way up
So have the men Denton told me
So have we
He pointed to his eyes and saw that they were red rimmed and inflamed
The two laborers Mexicans came over to us
One of them said some STRANGE STORIES thing in Spanish
Todd barked sharp order and they fell back hesitating
Then without further parley they took to their heels down the trail
Denton started forward with an angry shoot but Todd caught his arm
No use he said quickly
Well have to get the bells out ourselves
You found the last one
asked as he turned back up the trail
We found them all three Todd said somberly
Denton and dug up the last one ourselves
And we found this too
HE drew dirtencrusted greenish metal tube from his pocket and gave it to me
Within the cylinder was sheet of parchment in remarkably good state of preservation
puzzled over the archaic Spanish script
Let me Todd said taking it care fully
He translated expertly
On the twentyfirst of June by the favor of God the attack by the pagan Mutsunes having been repulsed the three bells cast month ago were bur ied in this secret cave and the entrance sealed but landslide obviously opened it up again recently Todd broke off to explain
Inasmuch as evil witchcraft was practiced by the Indians when we sus pended and rang the bells the evil demon whom the Mutsunes call Za chequon was called from his dwelling beneath the mountains and brought the black night and the cold death among us
The large cross was over thrown and many of the people were possessed of the evil demon so that the few of us who retained our senses were hard put to it to overcome their fiendinspired attack and remove the bells
Afterward we gave thanks to God for our preservation and gave aid to those who were injured in the fray
The souls of those who perished were commended to God and we prayed that the San Antonio would soon ar rive to relieve us from this cruel soli tude
charge whomever may find these bells should it not please God to allow me to fulfill this duty to send them to Rome in the name of our mas ter the king
May God guard him
Todd paused and carefully returned the parchment to its case
Junipero Serra signed it he said quietly
Lord what find
But surely you dont think theres any thing Who said did
Todd snapped in voice that betrayed his nervous ten sion
Theres some logical explana tion superstition and autosugges tion are bad combination
Wheres Sarto
Denton asked with note of apprehension in his voice
We were standing at the edge of little clearing bare and rocky
He has the cabin down the trail Todd said
You must have passed it
left him here with the bells when Jose had his seizure
Hadnt we better get Joses body to town
Todd frowned
Dont think me bru tal he said
But these bells cant leave them here
The mans dead
We cant help him and itll take all three of us to get the bells to town
Its too bad the poor chap didnt have Dentons sense of direction he finished with grim smile
He wouldnt have run into the tree then
He was right
believe that Denton could have traversed the entire trail blindfolded after having once as cended it
He had remarkable mem ory and sense of direction like those Indians who could unerringly find their way to their wigwams across hundreds of miles of wilderness
Later this trait of Dentons was to be of vital importance but no premonition of this came to us at the time
We had climbed the rocky mountain slope above the clearing and had come out in little glade among the pines
Nearby was gaping hollow in the ground around it evidence of re cent landslide
Where the devil
Todd said star ing around
How Hes gone Denton said in amaze ment
And the bells with him Then we heard it faint hollow musical note the sound of bell hit ting wood
It came from above us and glancing up the slope we saw an odd sight
man gaunt bearded with blazing thatch of red hair was tugging at rope he had stretched over the ELLS OF HORROR branch af pine
At the other end of the rope Slowly they rose silhouetted against the sky the lost bells of San Xavier
Gracefully curved they glowed bronze even beneath their stains and verdigris and they were silent for they had no clappers
Once or twice they swung against the trunk of the pine and sent out hollow mournful note
How the man could lift that great weight was inexplicable could see the muscles cord and knot on his bare arms as he strained
His eyes were bulging and his teeth clenched in grinning mouth
Denton cried starting to clamber up the slope
What are you doing
STARTLED the man jerked his head around and stared at us
The rope slipped through his fingers and we saw the bells plunge down
With frightful effort he clutched the rope and halted their descent momentarily but the strain threw him off balance
He tottered overbalanced and came crashing down the slope and behind him overtaking him rolled and bounded the bells throbbing and booming as they clashed against rocks
God heard Todd whisper
The mad fool
There was maelstrom of dust and flying shale on the slope above
heard sickening crunch and Denton threw himself desperately aside
Through the dust saw one of the bells smash down on the sliding body of Sarto and then was stumbling away scrub bing furiously at my eyes blinded by the flying particles of dirt
The rattle and roar subsided slowly as clung to tree
blinked glanced around
Almost at my feet was one of the bells
There was great crimson stain upon it
The body of Sarto was visible jammed into bush on the slope above
And few feet below it propped upright against jagged rock was Sartos battered gory head
Thus ended the first act of the drama was to witness
The bells were to be hung two weeks later
There was some stir in the news papers and considerable more among historians

Xavicr from all over the world were planned
In the cold daylight of logic out side the eerie atmosphere of the Pinos Mountains the unusual occurrences during the unearthing of the bells were easily explained
virulent kind of poisoning perhaps similar to poison oak or some fungus hidden in the cave with the relics had been respon sible for our optical irritation and the madness of Sarto and the Mexican
Neither Denton Todd nor denied this explanation but we discussed the matter at length among ourselves
Denton went so far as to drive down to the Huntington Library to view the forbidden Johann Negus translation of the Book of lod that abhorrent and monstrous volume of ancient esoteric formulae about which curious legends still cling
Only single copy of the original volume written in the pre human Ancient Tongue is said to ex ist
Certainly few even know of the expurgated Johann Negus translation but Denton had heard vague rumors about passage in the book which he declared might be connected with the legends of the San Xavier bells
When he returned from Los Angeles he brought sheet of foolscap paper covered with his execrable penman ship
The passage he had copied from the Book of lod was this The Dark Silent One dwelleth deep be neath the earth on the shore of the West ern Ocean
Not one of those potent Old Ones from hidden worlds and other stars is He for in earths hidden blackness He hath always dwelt
No name hath He for He is the ultimate doom and the undying emptiness and silence of Old Night
When earth is dead and lifeless and the stars pass into the blackness He will rise again and spread His dominion over all
For He hath naught to do with life and sunlight but loveth the blackness and the eternal silence of the abyss
Yet can He be called to earths surface before His time and the brown ones who dwell on the shore of the Western Ocean have power to do this by ancient spells and certain deeptoned sounds which reach His dwell ingplace far below
But there is great danger in such summoning lest He spread death and night before His time
For He bringeth dark ness within the day and blackness within the light all life all sound all movement passeth away at His coming
He cometh sometimes within the eclipse and althoagh He hath no name the brown ones know Him as Zushakon
There was deletion at that point Denton said as glanced up from the excerpt
The books expurgated you know
Its very odd Todd said picking up the paper and running his eyes over it
But of course its merely coincidence
Certainly since folklore is based on natural phenomena one can generally find modern parallels
The thunderbolts of Jove and Apollos arrows are merely lightning and sun stroke
Never on them does the shining sun look down with his beams Den ton quoted softly
But deadly night is spread abroad over these hapless men Remember Odysseus visit to the Land of the Dead
TODDS mouth twisted wryly
Well what of it
dont expect Pluto to come up from Tartarus when the bells are hung
Do you
This is the twentieth century such things dont happen in fact never did happen
Are you sure
Denton asked
Surely you dont pretend to believe this cold weather were having is nor mal
glanced up quickly
had been wondering when someone would men tion the abnormal chill in the air
Its been cold before Todd said with sort of desperate assurance
And overcast too
Just because were having some muggy weather is no rea son for you to let your imagination get the upper hand
Its good God
We went staggering across the room
Earthquake Denton gasped and we headed for the door
We didnt race for the stairs but remained just beneath the lintel of the doorway
During an earthquake its the safest place in any building on account of the nature and strength of its con struction
But there were no more shocks
Denton moved back into the room and hurried to the window
Look he said breathlessly beck oning
Theyre hanging the bells
We followed him to the window
From it we could see the Mission San BELLS OF HORROR Xavier two blocks away and in the arches in the bell tower figures were toiling over the three bells
They say when the bells were cast the Indians threw the body of living girl into the boiling metal Denton said apropos of nothing
know it Todd answered snap pishly
And the shamans enchanted the bell with their magic
Dont be fool
Why shouldnt some peculiar vi bration like the sound of bell create certain unusual conditions
Denton asked hotly and thought detected note of fear in his voice
We dont know all there is to know about life Tcdd
It may take strange forms or even Clanggg
The booming ominous note of bell rang out
It was strangely deep thrill ing through my eardrums and sending its eerie vibration along my nerves
Denton caught his breath in gasp
deeper note throbbing sending curious pain through my head
Some how urgent summoning
Clang ggclanggg
thunder ing fantastic music such as might issue from the throat of god or from the heartstrings of the dark angel Israfel
Was it growing darker
Was shadow creeping over San Xavier
Was the Pacific darkening from spar kling blue to leaden gray to cold blackness
Then felt it premonitory trem ble of the floor beneath my feet
The window rattled in its casing
felt the room sway sickeningly tilt and drop while the horizon seesawed slowly madly back and forth
heard crashing from below and picture dropped from the wall to smash against the floor
Denton Todd and were swaying and tottering drunkenly toward the door
Somehow felt that the build ing wouldnt stand much more
It seemed to be growing darker
The room was filled with hazy tenebrous gloom
Someone screamed shrilly

STERLINE Ohio Ave Sidney Ohio STRANGE STORIES Continued from page spurt of dust spray out from the wall and bit of plaster dropped away
And suddenly went blind
At my side Denton cried out abruptly and felt hand grip my arm
That you Ross
heard Todd ask in his calm voice precise as ever
Is it dark
Thats it Denton said from some where in the blackness
Im not blind then
Where are you
Wheres the door
violent lurch of the building broke Todds clutch on my arm and was flung against the wall
Over here shouted above the crashing and roar ing
Follow my voice
In moment felt someone fum bling against my shoulder
It was Denton and soon Todd joined him
Whats happening
jerked out
Those damned bells Denton shouted in my ear
The Book of Iod was right
He bringeth darkness within the day Youre mad
Todd cried sharply
But punctuating his words came the furious earsplitting dinning of the bells clanging madly through the blackness
Why do they keep ringing them
Denton asked and answered his own question The earthquakes doing it the quakes ringing the bells
Something struck my cheek and putting up my hand felt the warm stickiness of blood
Plaster smashed somewhere
Still the earthquake shocks kept up
Denton shouted some thing which did not catch
Todd and cried simul taneously
Bells weve got to stop them
Theyre causing this darkness per haps the earthquake too
Its vibra tion cant you feel it
Something in the vibration of those bells is blanket ing the suns lightwaves
For lights vibration you know
If we can stop them It would be fools errand Todd cried
Youre talking nonsense Then stay here
can find my way will you come Ross
For second did not answer
All the monstrous references gleaned from our study of the lost bells were flood ing back into my mind the ancient god Zuchequon whom the Mutsunes were supposed to have the power of summoning by certain deeptoned sounds He corneth sometimes with in the eclipse All life passeth away at his coming Yet can He be called to earths surface before His time Im with you Denton said
Then damn it so am
Todd snapped
Ill see the end of this
If there is anything HE DID not finish but felt hands groping for mine
Ill lead Denton told us
Take it easy now
wondered how Denton could find his way in that enveloping shroud of jet blackness
Then remembered his uncanny memory and sense of direc tion
No homing pigeon could make straighter way to its destination than he
It was mad Odyssey through black hell of shrieking ruin
Flying objects screamed past us unseen walls and chimneys toppled and smashed nearby
Frightened hysterical men and women blundered into us in the dark and went shouting away vainly searching for escape from this stygian deathtrap
And it was cold cold
frigid and icy chill pervaded the air and ray fin gers and ears were already numbed and aching
The icy air sent knife edged pains slashing through my throat and lungs as breathed
heard Denton and Todd wheezing and gasping curses as they stumbled along beside me
How Denton ever found his way through that chaotic maelstrom shall never understand
Denton shouted
The Mis sion
Somehow we mounted the steps
How the Mission managed to stand through the grinding shocks do not know
What probably saved it was the curious regularity of the temblors the quakes were more of rhythmic slow swaying of the earth than the usual abrupt wrenching shocks
From nearby came low chanting incongruous in the madness around us
BELLS OF HORROR Gloria Patri Filio Spiiitui Sanc to
The Franciscans were praying
But what availed their prayers while in the tower the bells were sending out their blasphemous summons
Luckily we had often visited the mission and Den ton knew his way to the tower
On that incredible climb up the stairs to the bell tower shall not dwell although every moment we were in danger of being dashed down to instant death
But at last we won to the loft where the bells were shriek ing their thunder through the black ness almost in our ears
Denton re leased my hand and shouted something could not distinguish
There was an agony of pain in my head and my flesh ached with the cold
felt an over powering impulse to sink down into black oblivion and leave this hellish chaos
My eyes were hot burning aching
For moment thought had lifted my hands unconsciously to rub my eyes
Then felt two arms constrict about my neck and vicious thumbs dug cruelly into my eyesockets
shrieked with the blinding agony of it
battled desperately in the dark ness battling not only my unknown assailant but fighting back mad per verse impulse to allow him to gouge out my eyes
Within my brain voice seemed to whisper Why do you need eyes
Blackness is better light brings pain
Blackness is best
But fought fiercely silently roll ing across the swaying floor of the belltower smashing against the walls tearing those grinding thumbs away from my eyes only to feel them come fumbling back
And still within my brain that horrible urgent whisper grew stronger You need no eyes
Eternal blackness is best
was conscious of different note in the clamor of the bells
What was it
There were only two notes now one of the bells had been silenced
Somehowe the cold was not so oppres sive
And was grayish radiance be ginning to pervade the blackness
Certainly the temblors were less vio lent and as strained to break away Continued on page REV mm iQF El CI AUDELS HANDY BOOK OF ELECTRICITY nW Engineers Electricians Students and all inter ested in Electricity

St Louis Adtion the World Over in Stories That Take You to Svery Part of the Globe IN OUR COMPANION MAGAZINE THRILLING ADVENTURES AT ALL STANDS Continued from page from my shadowy opponent felt the racking shocks subside grow gentler die away altogether
The harsh clangor of the two bells stopped
My opponent suddenly shuddered and stiffened
rolled away sprang up in the grayness alert for re newal of the attack
It did not come
Very slowly very gradually the darkness lifted from San Xavier
Grayness first like pearly opales cent dawn then yellowish fingers of sunlight and finally the hot blaze of summer afternoon
From the bell tower could see the street below Where men and women stared up un believingly at the blue sky
At my feet was the clapper from one of the bells
Denton was swaying drunkenly his white face splotched with blood his clothing torn and smeared with dust
That did it he whispered
Only one combination of sounds could sum mon the Thing
When silenced one bell He was silent staring down
At our feet lay Todd his clothing dishevelled his face scratched and bleeding
As we watched he got weakly to his feet look of monstrous horror growing in his eyes
Involuntarily shrank back my hands going up protectingly
HE flinched Ross he whispered through white lips
My God oss couldnt help it
couldnt help it tell you
Something kept telling me to put out your eyes and Dentons too and then to gouge out my own
voice in my head And abruptly understood remem bering that horrible whisper within my brain while struggled with poor Todd
That malignant horror he whom the Book of Iod called Zusha kon and whom the Mutsunes knew as Zuchequon had sent his evil potent command into our brains command ing us to blind ourselves
And we had nearly obeyed that voiceless dreadful command
But all was well now
Or was it
had hoped to close the doors of my memory forever on the entire hor rible affair for it is best not to dwell too closely upon such things
And de spite the storm of adverse criticism BEST FUN FICTION AND FOTOS IN and curiosity that was aroused by the smashing of the bells the next day with the full permission of Father Bernard of the Mission had fully determined never to reveal the truth of the matter
It was my hope that only three men Denton Todd and myself might hold the key to the horror and that it would die with us
Yet something has occurred which forces me to break my silence and place before the world the facts of the case
Denton agrees with me that perhaps thus mystics and oc cultists who have knowledge of such things may be enabled to utilize their knowledge more effectually if what we fear ever comes to pass
Two months after the affair at San Xavier an eclipse of the sun occurred
At that time was at my home in Los Angeles Denton was at the headquar ters of the Historical Society in San Francisco and Arthur Todd was oc cupying his apartment in Hollywood
The eclipse began at pm and within few moments of the begin ning of the obscuration felt strange sensation creeping over me
dread fully familiar itching manifested it self in my eyes and began to rub them fiercely
Then remembering jerked down my hands and thrust them hastily into my pockets
But the burn ing sensation persisted
The telephone rang
Grateful for the distraction went to it hurriedly
It was Todd
He gave me no chance to speak
Ross its back
he cried into the transmitter
Ever since the eclipse began Ive been fighting
Its power was strongest over me you know
It wants me to help me Ross
cant keep Then silence
Wait hold on just for few moments
Ill be there
No answer
hesitated then hung up and raced out to my car
It was normal twentyminute drive to Todds apartment but covered it in seven with my lights glowing through the gloom of the eclipse and mad thoughts crawling horribly in my brain

McNTEII BACHELOR OF MTJBIC TF South Van Meu Los Angeles Calif Concluded from page at my side
Todds door was locked
After few fruitless shouts we burst it open
The electric lights were blaz ing
What cosmic abominations may be summoned to dreadful life by ageold spells and sounds is question dare not contemplate for have hor rible feeling that when the lost bells of San Xavier were rung an unearthly and terrible chain of consequences was set in motion and believe too that the summoning of those evil bells was more effective than we then real ized
Ancient evils when roused to life may not easily return to their brood ing sleep and have curious horror of what may happen at the next eclipse of the sun
Somehow the words of the hellish Book of lod keep recurring to me Yet can He be called to earths surface before His time He bring eth darkness All life all sound all movement passeth away at His com ing and worst of all that horribly significant phrase He cometh some times within the eclipse
Just what had happened in Todds apartment do not know
The tele phone receiver was dangling from the wall and gun was lying beside my friends prostrate form
But it was not the scarlet stain on the left breast of his dressinggown that riveted my horrorblasted stare it was the hol low empty eyesockets that glared up sightlessly from the contorted face that and the crimsonstained thumbs of Arthur Todd

THE BLACK ARTS Continued iiom page But there was no blood
The flesh was rancid like the body of dead man long buried
Later the corporal would have been courtmartialed for causing the death of the soldiers who had responded to his false signal were it not for the testimony of the private and also the sworn statements by Chinese merchants of the village that Zombies had long worked in the grain fields beyond the village
This Chinese gunner was Zombie He had been placed at this gun and ordered by the satanic will of his master to pull the trigger whenever soldiers appeared be fore him
Like an automaton he had re sponded until blown to bits removing what demonic power had been able to control his bloodless corpse
Bodies of dead men housing the magic of the devil
Who can tell
At least give the devil his due LUCIFER
LETTERS FROM READERS SPEAKING of the devil and his due we think it only fair to do the same for those disciples of Lucifer who have some diabolical or praiseworthy
comments to make about STRANGE STORIES
We cant possibly include the thousands who responded so nobly to our request for let ters but we can dip into the brew at ran dom and ladle out extracts from as many letters as we have room for
To all how ever who wrote in we are grateful as even devils can be and we invite you to continue your personal dissections of our attempts to present the uncanny and strange
Here goes then with our brew
cupful from RobL Madle Phila Pa was indeed pleased to note the appearance ol the first issue of STBANGE STOKIES
The cover picture does not typify the type of stories published
Please have real fantastic cover on the next issue many of your interior artists are quite capable of painting excellent covers
Thanks for the variety of artists theyre all good with Wesso and Paul doing the best work it would be good idea to have several drawings each issue by Virgil Finlay he is unsur passable when it comes to illustrating weird fic tion
The stories themselves were either good or fair with THE SORCERERS JEWEL by Tarleton Eiske and MAJOR McCRAItYS VISION by Ralph Farley the most outstanding
It might be good idea to print stories of pure fantasy in future issues and please subordinate the dead man ris ing from his grave to wreak vengeance on his killer etc
For his reason didnt care for Henry Kuttners THE FROG
Kuttner usually writes very excellent fantasy but he fell down this time
Wellmans CHANGELING was nice little piece of fantasy
Cant say Ive read anything similar to it before
On the whole the first issue of STRANGE STORIES was fairly good but there is plenty room for improvement

We dip into the cauldron now and come up with the following from Harold Feating of Quincy Mass
Please keep the standard of STRANGE STORIES up to its present level
Commenting on the stories in the first issue THE SINGING SHADOWS was superb although written by an author have never heard of before THE CURSE OF THE HOUSE another grand storv by longtime favor ite of mine Hubert Bloeh EYES OF THE HE IENT by two more ot my favorite authors Der leth and Schorer fairly good but not up to thefr usual high standard THE INVADERS excellent although Keith Hammond is also new name to me CHANGELING by Well man is perfect exam ple of weirdness THE SORCERERS JEWEL by Iiske another fine weird yarn and another new author
Good illustrators in issue Wesso Morey Paul Jwck Binder
THE BLACK ARTS is grand department written as convincingly as any fiction
Keep this department
hope too you will have some kind of club similar to the ScienceFiction League of THRILLING WONDER STORIES of which am member
And heres to your coining out more frequently
Yes were planning club and will tell you about it in the next issue
Down goes the ladle again and we come up with couple of short spoonsful
Reagan Pittsburgh Pa says Tour first issue of STRANGE STORIES hits the spot
The subject matter is varied to suit any taste
So keep up the pood work
Would like to see vampire story in the next Issues
good out right ghost story will not be overlooked either
And Gertrude Gordon of New York City congratulates and criticizes us with STRANGE STORIES is splendid and am devotee of fantastic fiction
If it keeps to its pres ent stature it will be in the lead of the several really good magazines dealing with the uncanny
But please not those kind of pictures on the eov through it one day and found to my delight it wasnt but the picture is so misleading
If yon have something definitely fantastic on the cover Im sure youve got something there
We hope so
Stirring the brew around again up pops Weaver Wright of Holly wood Calif am sorry to say found the first issue ol STRANGE STORIES too interesting to ignore
Yoo see get fantasy mags galore Including your compnmon magazines THRILLING WONDER STORIES and STARTLING STORIES
So had hoped my interests being primarily scientific fictional and my time all occupied that STRANGE STORIES would be too predominantly weird to warrant my actually reading it onlv filing It away to keep my collection complete
But If youre go ing to offer nifty featnre stories regular
Like THE SINGING SHADOWS an absorbinguncanny yarn
Farley yarn MAJOR McCRARYS VISION and Paulpictured INVADERS enjoyed next best
As for illustrations THE FROG and SERVANT OP SATAN by Marchioni and Sehomburg
Klines story however was grave deKIlne for its author or maybe it was ftosiwrltten
One complaint Poor cover no individuality
One big compliment The novacious motion of naT iug every story illustrated by different artist
And heres some liquid we bring to the surface tagged Ross Jobe of Jefferson City Mo
never thought would ever be in position to correct an editor and wouldnt let this chance THE BLACK ARTS pass by for lots of money because Ive taken bo many corrections from them
In THE BLACK ABTS department Lucifer states that King Saul Haw the ghost of Solomon
Tut tot According to the Bible he asked for and saw the wraith of Samuel
The February edition was beyond doubt fine one
And beyond doubt Reader Jobe is cor rect
Chalk up one lapsis mentis for Luci fer the devil has his weak moments
Now bubbling up from our cauldron comes Douglas Robinson from Garrett Hill Pa am interested in BLACK ARTS organization
think the magazine is the hest of its kind
Please send me information about ths items of King Saul and Salem
would like to get any kino of infor mation and stories of Black Arts
For King Saul we refer you to the first book of Samuel Chapter Verses
And for Salem witchcraft among others there are the following books Narratives of Witchcraft Cases by George Burr Scribners Sundry Documents of Witch craft in Mass by Geo
Chamberlain New England Historical Society and Witchcraft in Salem by John Fiske Houghton Mifflin Co
Our ladle dips up weighty bowlful from Mason of Toronto Ontario
Weve absorbed the criticisms and sugges tions as well as the praises and will give proper consideration to them but all we have room for now are few comments on the stories The stories are for the most part very good and rate as follows
THE CTCKSE OP THE HOUSE THE INVAD ERS and THE SORCERERS JEWEL
Tied for first place
If you produce three such stories as these per issue wont be doing much growling
Wellmana little gem THE CHANGELING would take second place
Parleys short htt me in somewhat the Bame way as Well mans nice and pleasing
Then come ETES OF Till HKK NT and THK FROG followed by THE SINGING SHADOWS very well written but not quite bizarre enough and finally SERVANT OF SATAN

THE BOSS DIDNT EVEN KNOW MY NAME He said he remembered seeing me around but he didnt even know my name until the wrote him that William Harris had enrolled for course of home study and was doing fine work
Whos William Harris
he asked
Then he looked me up
Told me he was glad to see was ambitious
Said hed keep his eye on me
He did too
Gave me my chance when Frank Jordan was sent out on the road
was promoted over older men who had been with the firm for years
My sparetime studying helped me to get that job and to keep it after got it It certainly was lucky day for me when signed that
One reason employers recognize the value of
training is that many of them are former students
They recognize that todays students are tomor rows leaders
In the years since these Schools were founded more than has been spent in preparing and revising texts
per sonal individual method of instruction has been developed

SOUND VALUE THE TRUE VALUE OF ANYTHING IS MEASURED BY THE SATISFACTION IT BESTOWS IN RELATION TO THE SACRIFICE IT DEMANDS
The public too often confuses value with price
Price is only one of the two factors that determine value
The other the worth of the goods offered
The real worth of cotton fabrics is measured by their actual resistance to wear or wash and their permanency of finish
It is impossible for the public to determine these qualities except by actual service or by certain identification and positive guarantee
That is why Tootals inaugurated their famous policy of selvedge marking or otherwise branding their wide range of superior pro ducts listed on this page and of guaranteeing their real worth
By thus enabling the public instantly to identify any of these guaranteed lines on any drapers counter all risk of unsound material finish or dye is eliminated and permanent satisfaction assured

HEALTH System of Exercise for Everyone from Infancy to Old Age
RATIONAL exercise is the first step towards better health
It is what Nature prescribes to keep the body fit

His System is exercise without drudgery
It is scientific easy delightful and suited to old and middleaged persons of either sex as well as to the young
No appliances of any kind are required
The whole series of movements occupies only few minutes daily and there is no risk of strain
The responsiveness of the body to the exercises is immediate because they exercise all the vital organs and every muscle of the body
The series includes self massage with the hands novel feature which produces delightful exhilarating glow removes and prevents indi gestion and constipation promotes circulation tones the nerves and makes the skin clear and healthy
The Bodybending and twisting Exercises performed without diffi culty even by people unused to ex ercise strengthen the muscles of the trunk and massage the inner organs ensuring functional effici ency
As result the acids which cause gout rheumatism and simi lar ailments are removed from the system
Stoutness is overcome by the discipline of the body under the Muller System because the exer cises restore the entire physical organism to its normal or natural condition of health
For the same reasons the System corrects ex cessive thinness
The Muller System requires no prolonged or painful effort
The movements are varied pleasant to perform and adaptable to every degree of physical strength
It is therefore method of health exercise keenly appreciated by ladies who desire shapely and graceful figure clear skin and the cure by natural means of the many ailments which frequently impair the picture of health
Why this is accomplished by the practice of the Muller System is explained in booklet The Royal Road to Health and Beauty copy of which will be sent post free to all lady enquirers

Evidence concerning the System
Dr JAMES SWANSON MA MB CM FRFPS
Glasgow have no hesitation in saying that no living man has done more to promote clean healthy life among the men and women of England than you have done
wish you long life and strength to continue your good work of salvation by attention to the body
THE SUNDAY TIMES To sum up the Muller System is undoubtedly an allround comprehensive method of regularly exercising every muscle of the body in minimum amount of time and that briefly spells health
Mr HUGH de SELINCOURT writing in The Daily Mail After three months regular discipline discipline mind you accessible to every man mans body changes almost be yond belief
Do it and you will see
Do it for the sake of your health and the health of your children and your childrens children
Do it for the sake of England who wants tough healthy men
THE TIMES Lieutenant Muller is good advertise ment of his system for he has fine well proportioned figure his muscles are not developed to excess and it would not be difficult to find many young men in the Army or at the Universities of larger muscular proportions
THE OBSERVER There is no terrible development of thigh or biceps
You are only supple and upright only healthier and happier less cross and less nervous only nicer to live with cleaner pluckier and more selfcon fident
ARMY NAVY CHRONICLE It is essentially system of home gymnastics suitable for all ages of men and women
It is simplicity itself and very slight acquaintanceship will convince those who try it of the benefit to be derived from it
It should be introduced into every school and we should like to say every family in England
SVENSK DAM TIDNING the wellknown Swedish Ladies Magazine Most earnestly do we recommend Lieut
Mullers System to the whole world of women
Daily baths systematic exer cises and massage and exposure to fresh air and sunshine are not only means to health but also to beauty and natural vivacity
Sir ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE One becomes fit and keeps fit by carry ing out Lieut
Muilers System which is natural course of exercises without the use of musclestraining instruments causing no great strain and resulting in no after collapse
Dr VALENTINE KNAGGS in his work Indigestion its Cause and Cure The Muller exercises are probably the best devised for remedying constipation and indigestion

ONE OF THE BULLDOG BREED
Aa indent is wondrously perfected device for whitening the hair of the officer involved
Mr Arnold Bennett in The Daily News
Lieut and ActingQuartermaster Denton Smy the sat in his office prepared for the nerveracking process of filling in the daily indent
Summoning up that courage which is instinctive in the British officer he opened Army Book and wrote the name of his unit Bty
th Bde
on the top line
Without resting after the mental strain involved he filled in the word One in the space for No
of days rations required and again without pause filled in the date Sept th in the space for Date when rations are required
Many men would have taken rest at this point but Lieut
Denton Smy the was made of sterner stuff
He only paused long enough to dip his pen in the ink and then entered the number in the space for No
of officers warrant officers noncom
officers and men and the number in the space for No
of rations required
The unflinching sense of duty which characterises our officers was never better exemplified than in the case of Lieut
Denton Siny the
Even after the exhausting mental effort required to calculate that men would require rations he would not yield to exhaustion
Again dipping his pen in the ink with the same deter mination with which he would have thrust bayonet through German he put the number in the space provided on the form for No
of horses and again with no outward sign of brain fatigue he calculated the number of rations required for horses and entered the number in the space provided
Then gathering together what remained of his superb energy he signed his name at the foot of the document and laid down his pen
Here one would like to he able to say that he was free to rest to go on leave for week and attended by loving members of bis family or by one even dearer than they to recuperate his jaded brain and shattered tissues
But the Army regulations are callous and no such happy ending is possible unless we tamper with truth
The gallant officer had laid down his pen but his task was still incomplete
He had yet to detach the indent from the book
This done he rose and with supreme effort opened the door and said Corporal send this to the Supply Office
Then he collapsed
THE SIGNAL
Concerning the multitudinous charms and stately sweet nesses of Audrey much might be written but as this is to be an article as opposed to book and as young goddesses being but human may be spoilt by too candid worship will here confine myself to her single fault
Audrey is romantic nay more she is mediaeval
When recently approached her with certain momentous question she was fresh from halfadozen versions of the Tristram and Iseult legend and to say that she was full of it is to put the case feebly
The sick lover was to infer you remember from the white or black sail on the good ship Sivan whether his affaire was going smoothly or quashed for ever and Audrey proposed to tell me my fate by modernised treat ment of the idea
After clear week for reflection she would meet me by appointment and if she came clad in brilliant hues might go to the jewellers at once for the ring but if the tints of her attire were neutral all would be over and could interview the chemist with an order for strychnine at my earliest convenience
The fateful night arrived and Audreys ensemble flung me into mingled triumph and despair
Even to my dull masculine eyes the run of her tints was appallingly neutral but there was one solitary gleam of hope
She wore on her breast screaming red rosette which would have spoilt the beauty of any ordinary girl
Poor tonguetied coward lacked the nerve to insist on an answer outright and we proceeded with the agenda of the evening which consisted of theatre modest Warsupper and taxi home
trust never again to pass through such torments of doubt and suspense
At last as we stood on the steps of The Lindens where Audrey dwells could no longer silence my anguish
Tell me dearest whispered hoarse with emotion tell me and put me out of my pain
Are these tints to be taken as brilliant or neutral
You silly boy she replied as if could dress in bright colours nowadays
Why you cant get anything in that line fit to make up for love or money
great wave of hope surged over me
But this thing cried pointing to the scarlet abomina tion on her breast it means
she whispered
It dead secret and papa would disinherit me if he found out
stole his Civic Volunteer brassard and made temporary rosette of it
That seemed the handiest way to show what mean My memory has as yet failed to reconstruct fully the next whirling moment but it is thought from the undeniable dustiness of my knees on the following morning that behaved in the best sixteenth century style
Audrey informs me that special on duty outside Menaggio four doors away paused as if in doubt whether to arrest me or not and at last gave furious stamp and strode off in disgust
It may be that long years had dimmed the memory of his own youth
Or possibly his feet were cold

THE SHIRKER
had never beaten Petherby not that he is billiard expert but merely that am rabbit
masterly series of two nursery cannons varied some times by and very occasionally coupled with hazard is all aspire to
Peth erby on the other hand can generally manage to score something every time and not infrequently runs into some of the humbler double figures
The truth is that do not possess the discriminating eye of Digglb for the niceties of angles
But have one facility of which am proud and to which shall allude later
few weeks ago at Petherbys house found him in one of his rare off moods
These off moods of his generally signify that he beats me by mere or so in up instead of by the more customary margin of or more
But on the night in question Petherby was playing so shockingly and so brilliantly on two successive visits to the table had played for safety and scored clear board each time that at length was to his
It was my turn to play
My first stroke though not exactly yielding the result had in mind was nevertheless most satis factory and comprehensive one
made cannon off the red and then my ball and Petherbys mysteri ously disappeared down different pockets
Petherby applauded with the butt of his cue upon the floor
Good shot Sir
he remarked sar castically
What pity it didnt all come off
All come off
said with hauteur
Why it did all come off much better than could have hoped for even in my most sanguine moments
What do you mean
Oughtnt the red to have done something gone down pocket for instance
Then you would have won the game
As it is Petherby said sternly re member please that there are three balls six pockets and certain laws of coincidence which must operate at times
In that stroke distinctly see the finger of Providence
You are not intended to win this game
Just look at the position of the red
The red was up the table close to the left cushion
To pot it was an im possibility as far as my limited tech nique was concerned but felt that by careful aiming so as to hit the paint without disturbing the ivory as ex pressively put it when narrating the incident to Pilkington could manage to run in
So took deliberate aim and pressed my cue gently forward
Slowly slowly my ball trickled up the table straight as die all the way
It was only few inches from the red and still running true when the electric lights went out
At the same instant loud report was heard followed immediately by second and third
cried Petherby
Where my umbrella
There other game afoot cried as fumbled for my cigarettelighter
The wick flamed up
hurried to the top of the table
My ball was in Get back Belgium
Get it back
You wait till yon chaps campin oh the ill gets out there
If they cant get it back no other way they ll pinor it
the pocket
shouted joyfully
Game to me
On the contrary said Petherby craning his neck over my shoulder it my game
You ve given three away
That red never budged hairsbreadth swear
couldnt possibly have missed
was dead on the edge of the red when the lights went out
Can you solemnly affirm you heard the balls click
Of course not you ass replied
How could through that beastly firing
On the other hand did you see me miss
How could in the dark
he answered testily
Exactly said
couldnt hear you couldnt see
As you maintain that the red hasnt moved the fairest thing will be for me to play the shot again
Bo you happen to have candle on you
There was knock at the door and the servant entered
If you please Sir she said the police sergeant has just been and said youre wanted at once at the station
must go immediately said Petherby struggling into his jacket
What nuisance these Zepp raids are interfering with ones amusements in this way
Eeally Half jiffy
cried as Petherby moved to the door
Wait while play that shot again
Anybody would think there was panic from your positively indecent haste
Sorry said Petherby edging off but duty is duty
Where would my crest of five oysters rampant gules on plat du jour argent be if my knightly ancestors had preferred billiards to duty
So long
There precedent for it retorted
How about Drakes game of bowls
But Petherby was half way down the staircase
yelled after him as realised that the issue must remain un decided
But stay Mary said would you take this lighter and hold it close to the red ball so
Now want you to watch the red ball carefully and tell me if this white one which am going to play touches it
placed my own ball back in baulk took long and careful aim and then
somehow managed
to miscue
No Sir it didnt hit the red one said Mary as my ball stopped few inghes from the baulkline
pretended to heave sigh of re lief
Thank goodness
Properly to explain the objoct and effect of that stroke Mary would necessitate my using technicalities which you would probably not under stand
think under the circum stances you had better not mention to Mr Petherby that required your assistance
He might consider it an abuse of his hospitality
Very good Sir said Mary as she exchanged the cigarette lighter for halfacrown

The House of Pope and Bradley is determined to maintain the reputation it has made and refuses to supply Officers with any material which they cannot absolutely guarantee
The prices charged represent the minimum at which uniforms of the best quality can be obtained and they are reasonable because the House is cne of the large buyers in London

One can save the expense and the trouble of cooking by just opening tin of Skippers the most delicious meal of all
No big bones or tough scales they just melt in your mouth as you eat them
The distinctive flavour which makes them so different from all other fish comes from the tasty microscopic Crustacea they feed on in the icecold raters of the Norwegian fjords

The Mistake
There is no need to specify the res taurant
It is famous for its English joints and is just now much visited by officers on leave who wish to eat together just as certain subterranean grillroom is the favourite resort of officers on leave when as not in frequently happens they entertain the other sex
To one of the tables thoughtfully provided with so many chairs that secrets have ever been out cf the ques tion here came two lieutenants very obviously oil duty for brief season and rejoicing in their liberty and he who was acting as host and bad long since settled all doubts as to what their meal was to consist of flung out the order for roast beef almost before he was seated flung ib out too as though expecting as instant response from the stall as he gets from his men all unmindful that this restaurant has leisurely processes of its own carefully acquired and perfected during many many years
Meanwhile the saddle of mutton was wheeled to my side and some unusually attractive slices were separated from it by knife like razor and laid before me
saw the lieutenants eyeing my plate with illconcealed enw but beef was in their minds
Beef had been in their minds for toilsome weeks and they did not betray their friend
At least not wholly but fancy the host wavered
wonder he began and said no more for the beef arrived on its little wagon and their plates were soon covered with it
It was not one of the most successful of the houses joints and again caught their eyes directed towards my saddle
Was it too late
their expression silently asked
Yes it was
Besides they had come there to eat beef
Nothing like beef
The lieutenants attacked with vigour but they still glanced muttonwards now and then meditatively between bites
Then the host spoke
It was in an undertone hut heard because at this restaurant as have said there are no secrets
wonder if we oughtnt to have bad saddle he murmured
It looks jolly good said the other
They ate on
Do you think the beef is absolutely tophole today
the host asked
ve known it better replied the other
They ate on
rather wish wed had mutton said the host
After all saddle you know
It not too common
Beef we can always get in some form or other not like this of course but beef whereas saddle saddles rare
wish you reminded me of the saddles here
Wed settled on beef long ago said the other performing prodigies of valour with his knife and fork
know but it as foolish not to look at the bill of fare
should have thought of it then
They still ate heartily
No chance of getting here again for goodness knows bow long said the host
The other dismally agreed
Could you manage slice of saddle after this
the host asked after busy interval
Sorry couldnt replied the other through mouthful which lion would not disdain
dont believe could either said the host
What bore
shall always regret not having had mutton
So shall said the other
At this moment the empty seat next to me was filled and to the enquiry of the head waiter whose duty it is to ask these questions and then disappear the customer replied Saddle of course
That all one comes here for
Both the lieutenants groaned audibly
Full though they were their lunch already ruined by me was ruined once more

CAMP QUARTERMASTERING
Matilda rather misled me on the question of buying meat
She said that there was no particular trick about it that all you have to do is to go to place where they sell meat and buy it taking care that you get the right weight and that the man does not throw too much bone and bits of sheeps head and cows feet on the scale
She said that purveyor of meat is easily identified because he wears peculiar blue costume and that the only other person you can possibly mistake for him is wounded soldier
got into the right kind of place first time and said should like to see some meat
The man didnt take any notice of me until he had finished cutting off and wrapping up in newspaper lump of meat for readymoney customer
Then he said What kind of meat
Beef and mutton and such like things
The butcher affectionately slapped the piece of meat which he had been carving and said Thats nice piece of steak
How much meat have you got there
About five pounds weigh it for you
think shall want rather more than that
He fetched down quite largo piece of meat off hook weighed it and said it was twentytwo pounds
was thinking of buying larger piece than that said
How much was you wanting
The piece had in mind should weigh between three and four thousand pounds
The eager look which came into his eyes was quickly succeeded by something akin to fear as he went to the door to make sure the policeman was taking his usual afternoon nap in the neighbourhood
If you was wanting to buy meat can sell it you but if you was looking for flock of sheep or herd of oxen admit havent got em in stock
dont necessarily ant to take it all with me said
What with my boy leaving me and my assistant joining the Army havent got time to waste joking
Perhaps you was thinking of giving party
No wasnt just wanted some meat but see you arent accustomed to serve large families and better try elsewhere
suppose it possible to buy meat for battalion somewhere in this town
If you want to buy meat for the Army you have to go to the meat market
The meat market is dull place the mention of thousands of pounds of meat doesnt excite the inhabitants in the least and they were rather bored with my little order however they condescended to deliver the stuff for me after totting it up in sheep and oxen
In spite of the fact that had the vinegar and more than one kind of meat both Matilda and the Quarter masterSergeant thought that the men would expect still greater variety and under protest added few things like bread jam and cheese
avoided small tradesmen in making these pur chases as they are so suspicious and only dealt with people who had the capital to carry decentsized stock
When the War Office heard about the things that Matilda and the Quarter masterSergeant had persuaded me to buy they naturally got jealous and started sending out circulars to say that they werent going to put up with any competition with their camps and that all camps without their name on were spurious and contrary to law
Of course didnt worry about the War Office because know that their printed circulars dont mean anything
and are only sent out to do the printers and the postoffice turn but the Adjutant and our Commandant who is in the regular army and doesnt understand War Office humour seemed to think that we ought to scratch the camp
They got the idea that had let myself into some kind of mess by what they were pleased to term my premature purchase of goods and the idea seemed to amuse them until explained that had bought all the goods in their names and that when the Corps funds were exhausted they would be personally responsible for the balance
So they went to talk to the War Office about it and met all the other Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants up there on the same errand
When the War Office found how unpopular their circular had made them and how they couldnt move about without falling over Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants they said they didnt object to camps being held if the GOC
of the various districts didnt object
Some people who took the War Office literally wrote to the GOC
of the respective districts where they proposed to camp and got leave which was then cancelled by the War Office
For myself took no such risk and as neither the War Office nor the GOC
of any district found out about our camp we didnt do any harm to anyone but ourselves and we only caught little things like rheumatism and indigestion
If anyone does find out about it shall apologise for my mis take and trust to his being too busy to do anything further in the matter
The camp was rather success we got most of the tents to stand up and some of them kept the rain out includ ing those that mattered mean of course mine and theCommandants and the Adjutants
By marking all the things Goods for Troops persuaded the railway company to deliver most of our provender in the belief that they were helping the Government who are among their best customers in these days
showed the Government mark on the tents to the railway people and they werent to know any more than was when bought them that it was the condemned mark
The vinegar didnt go so well as had expected and had good deal left on my hands in spite of the fact that got quite lot off in the shape of claretcup which retailed in the canteen
Some of the meat rounded on me and was accorded military funeral but not enough to make fuss about
had to pledge locally what was left of the Commandants and the Adjutants credit to make up for the unused vinegar and defective meat but there has been no trouble on that score up to now as they wont know about it until the bills come in and by that time shall either be on permanent leave or else have enlisted
Late produced upon the scene Mean as what you re meant to mean Manufactured and absurd Maimed and miserable word While live you shant prevail Mongrel docked of half your tail

Extracted prom ihb Diary os Toby MP
House of Commons Tuesday st September Introducing his first Bud get McKenna scored double record
In respect both of income and ex penditure he had to deal with the biggest of long list
The speech ex pounding it was the briefest
Marshalling multitude of figures from the extra halfpenny in the pound in the price of sugar up to the million pounds representing esti mated expenditure of the year his mastery of facts was so complete his explanation so lucid that the story was as easy to follow as an ordi nary nursery tale
Time was during the prime of Gladstone at the Treas ury and with his successors in later years when exposition of Budget was regarded as opportunity for great oratorical feat
Mr thought nothing of occupying five hours finishing up with peroration almost worth an additional penny in the pound on the income tax
No selfrespecting Chancellor of the old school would think of omitting to deck his business statement with classical quotation much appreciated below the Gangway
This habit led to first step in downfall of Bob Lowe
Allured by the tag Ex luce lucellum he invented tax upon matches with intent to label the boxes with the motto
In the end as everyone knows he had to remodel his Budget leaving out the obnoxious tax label and all
McKennas speech began without exordium finished without peroration and no single sentence rose above the Spartan simplicity of the Multiplication Table
Only approach to departure from this level was when he mentioned the dizzy height at which expenditure now flies
He thereupon declared his confidence that House and country were prepared to support the Government in bearing whatever measure of taxation is deemed necessary now and he ominously added in the future for the successful prosecution of the War
hearty cheer confirmed this assur ance
Cheerfulness was indeed the prevail ing note of historic occasion
Fresh burden of taxation imposed enormous
Affects every class from the consumer of halfounces of tea and quarters of pound of sugar to the hapless millionaire who out of his modest in come of hundred thousand pounds year will be called upon to contribute to the State the sum of more than onethird of the whole
This of course in addition to his share of in direct taxation
As the Member for Sark says Lloyd George chastised the taxpayer with whips McKenna lays on with scorpions
And yet no murmur is heard
In November last Lloyd George imposed fresh taxation esti mated to bring in revenue of millions
On the top of that McKenna levies new taxes which in full effec tive year will increase the revenue by little short of millions
big bill but it will be met uncom plainingly with any further charges that may presently be necessary for carrying on the War to its inevitable end

Jimmys Uncle is coming
But perhaps you know
The telegraph boy told Jimmy as he was bringing the telegram he was coming by the three oclock train the telegraph boy said Jimmys Uncle is Colonel didnt tell you
and Jimmys mother hadnt seen him for years and years and longer than that Jimmy says not since she was in India
Jimmys Uncle used to know Jimmys father quite well because you see they had been brothers and Jimmys Uncle knew all about Jimmys father winning the Victoria Cross in India but you havent got to talk about that or Jimmy will fight you really mean not pretend
Jimmy says his Uncle has got piece of shrapnel in him and they wont let him stay at the Front because it hasnt burst yet and that why he is coming to see his mother Jimmy says the shrapnel might burst at any time and then it would blow hole ten feet deep in the ground but it would ease his Uncle because he has to walk very quietly and not get excited now
It because of the time fuse they put in them Jimmy says and you can hear it ticking
It makes his Uncle very wary and he has to avoid certain things at mealtimes which are not easily digested because the doctor says the shrapnel is quite enough
Jimmy has seen the porter at the station and he has promised to stop the train you do it by the bylaws Jimmy says
Jimmy told the porter he expected his Uncle would give him some rupees if he looked after the luggage well and the porter took Jimmy to see his he grew them in plot of ground quite close to the line when he wasnt busy cleaning the station lamps
He asked Jimmy if his Uncle soaked his in paraffin before sowing you do it be cause of the sparrers
The porter knew all about India he told Jimmy that theHoodans out there lived on rice pudding and it was very hot there because of the degrees of longitude which were very warm in those parts
The porter hadnt been there not himself but he had read good deal when he wasnt busy cleaning the station lamps
He said he often thought about India because he couldnt abear rice pudding
He said Jimmy might safely leave his Uncle to him
Jimmy went to bed early so as to give the next day chance
His mother nearly spoilt the day before it came because she put out his best sailor suit for him to wear and gave him three pennies to have in his pocket but not to spend
He said his Uncle would think it was Sunday and he put his head under the bedclothes to show what he thought of her
However he let her hold his hand tight for an hour and ten minutes before he went to sleep and when she came to look at him some time later he only smiled in his sleep when she gently removed his feet from the pillow and placed his head there once more
It took the day long time to break and Jimmy was glad when he heard the birds tidying up to get ready for it
He looked out of the window the day seemed very damp and as if it wanted airing so he got back to bed
It was eight oclock and the day was up and dressed and being busy when he next awoke
Jimmy had his mother at the station in good time and they had read all the PUNCH OB THE LONDON CHARIVARI

Jimmy says his Uncle looked very fierce when he arrived at the station and saw his mother
It made his mother cry and she wouldnt speak to him and that only made his Uncle grow fiercer and redder in the face
Jimmy says he thought the shrapnel was going to burst
Jimmy says his Uncle didnt take any notice of him although he kept on saluting him as hard as he could
Then his Uncle turned on him and glared at him and asked him what the dickens he meant standing there looking so much like hisfather
Jimmy said it made his mother very angry and she said Dont Tom dont and cried worse than ever
Jimmy says he clenched his fists and was going to give his Uncle the cowards blow when his Uncle turned his back on him and told the porter not to stand scratching his head like an idiot
Jimmy says the porter was only saluting all the time but he wasnt used to it and every time he got his hand to his head he forgot what he set out to do and scratched his head instead
Jimmy says they drove home in cab and neither his Uncle nor his mother said word to each other all the way they were so cross
Jimmy says his Uncle had bad cold and kept blowing his nose and every time he did it the cabhorse gave jump
Jimmy says his Uncle behaved better after tea
He wasnt so fierce so he asked him to show him his wound but his Uncle said it was under his binder and he couldnt
After the teathings had been put away they all three went into the draw ingroom to look at the large framed photograph of Jimmys father
Jimmy says they each held one of his hands and he had to bite his lip because they hurt
Jimmy says his Uncle didnt think much of the photograph
He just said He was man Mary man then he went very annoyed in the face clicked his heels saluted very hard and turned away
Jimmy says it made him feel quite angry with his Uncle and he went and climbed up on the top of the coalhouse in his best clothes on purpose and he wouldnt come down until his Uncle had promised to be good and not to make his mother cry
Jimmy says his Uncle gave him his word as an officer and they got on better after that
Jimmy said his prayers to his Uncle that night and he let him know what he thought of him
He asked that his Uncle might be made better man
His mother said Oh Jimmy
but his Uncle understood for he said Amen to that old chap

FEEDING THE NATION
Up with that lawn
Over with those flowerbeds
Such were the clarion cries of last March and the family flung themselves into the work of destruction with genuine patriotic ardour
In couple of days we the Medhurst family well known in this suburb as the people who hire motor cars no longer possessed garden
We had house and frightfulness
Still it was grand work
appointed the two youngest children Worm Gatherers in Ordinary with the occa sional rank of Earwig Squasher because although can plant seeds with anybody the handling of reptiles is simply not my sort of work
It was the one profession which did not include in the list of my sideaccomplishments for the National Register
My wife Mrs Medhurst known as the woman with four hats was given rake
Let us leave it at that
fell over it often
Jacqueline Medhurst who is now three and can say for Jacqueline gathered weeds and sang at her work
Yes yes know that it was charm ing of her but it must be pointed out that she is ac quainted with but one song and knows but two lines of that
They go like this ve got ripping little motor car And ve got yacht
Pay someone to sing those two lines into your ears for six hours on end
Everyone ought Nothing came up but kept on look ing despite certain scornfulness in the home circle
But had the laugh of everyone in the end
The seeds came up
My pride and joy in the little seed lings was however not longlived
The critics arrived
Always in life everyone is happy till the critics appear
The first of them in this case was my ridiculous and pompous fatherinlaw who after mumbling coarsely about greengrocery burst into rude guff aws because said he my celery the wellknown garden esculent should have been pricked off long ago
sneered rather hotly and said other people had other yiews about the correct period for pricking off whatever that Proprietor of boot shop tries to boom stock which the war has made unsaleable
forget what was insulted next
But they nearly all caught it
My wifes brother damned the broad beans and was foolish enough to offer himself for slaughter by inquiring if Id ever heard of blight
Then near rela tion of mine sorry to say fell fiercely upon my cauliflowers which he bitterly complained were cramped
Broccoli caught it too so did the parsley and even the radishes did not go scath less
was ashamed of course but having created my vegetables swore stand by them come what may
We would be misunderstood together
Then came the period of our annual holiday by the sea
It was wrench but consoled myself with the reflection that my plants
would do their best for me in my absence
They as
much as whispered it to me hen gave them their fare well watering
The weeks passed away wearily
got everything that could for the nation out of the sea shrimps several prawns two eel one minia ture dab half and on one glorious day seven mackerel hire of boat man lines hooks worms the thing you wind the lines on and piece of string to tie fish up coming to os
Still it wasnt like growing things and the day of our return was der Tag for me
Frankly was knocked
You ought to have seen that garden
Everything had grown furiously everything was much bigger
Nothing had stopped
But here must strike note of sorrow
With one brave to try it before reading any further
Tried it
Yes isnt it
Well we got the seeds in
They only cost two shillings Somebodys Monster Gift Parcel but had to pay one shilling for postage as the potatoes made the parcel heavy
Still didnt grudge that as there seemed to be an astonishing number of seeds
In fact when we had filled our garden there were packet of Early to Come peas another of Dwarf Kidney Beans and yet third of Bobbies Champion Leeks left over
mention this in case anyone would like to buy the surplus
They re still all right except the peas which have been played with by Alastair Medhurst and the bean bag which is frayed along one edge
No beans have escaped mind but the bag has unquestionably depreciated will allow for this
After the seeds were all in used to look at them good deal that is to say looked at the soil which covered them
might be that anyway mine was new variety and had arranged to prick off that day if not interrupted by callers
And when he gone pricked them off because remembered you dont eat the green stuff at the end
But then they stopped growing
There followed an attack upon my onions
The solicitor next door caught sight of them one Sunday morning and putting his head over the wall asked if they really were onions
said they were hardly onions but had certain onionimity
expected ata vistic tendencies however
He grinned because he has been to public school and said that ought to have asked him before trying onions
apologised and offered to dig them out and begin again
He told me that he was only trying to be friendly and that never get an onion if couldnt take tip
And then he went indoors noble exception nothing was eatable
The greenstuff was overrun with cater pillars and slugs the roots were rotting the beans were tough and coarse the peas were hard peas and the radishes were huge and woolly
What remained
My potatoes
My brave plucky persevering potatoes
They proved my only standby
There are plenty of them and the family is good enough to approve them
In fact we have more than we can eat
At the sideentrance have hung an unob trusive board bearing the legend Med hursts Middlings and charge one halfpenny under market price

PUNCH OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
MY DEAR SIR
He was small stout round man with bulging eyes and loose moist lips evidently an inquisitive gossipy fellow and he had been talking very optimistically about the War and very pessimistically about the taxation fortifying himself as he proceeded with quotations from the daily papers of which he had purchased every available specimen
could see that he was dying to tell me all about himself and at last out it came
He looked furtively round the railway compartment as if to assure himself that nobody was lurking in the rack or under the seats and spoke
presume he said that you dont know who really am
Ho said dont
havent got beyond classing you as friendly traveller
Thanks he said but didnt mean that
Of course dont want to push it on you
only wondered if you got any idea of what my work in life is
It unique business and keeps me hard at work can tell you
Look here he produced one of his papers and pointed out to me Mr Lloyd Georges letter what do you think of that
Very telling said distinguished by all the fire and eloquence and innocence for which is famous
Yes he said it pretty thing
Well that me
How do you mean that me
Dont you see its written to constituent
Well the constituent
My dear Sir cried congratulate you
To be Welshman is great thing to live in Carnarvon is gift from heaven and to be constituent of the Minister of Munitions must be the summit of earthly felicity and seized his hand and shook it warmly
Lord love you he said disengaging himself how you do jump at conclusions
Im no Welshman ve never been near Carnarvon and of course in technical sense not constituent of Lloyd Georges
an accom modation constituent that all
Generally corres pondent ve done lot of work for Balfour in that line but this time thought try new touch and so turned myself into constituent
Its gone off splendidly hasnt it
Ye es said but dont quite Dont you see
he said
When one of these big bugs wants to explain something or have whack at some body and theres hurry about it he doesnt wait until his next speech
He just gets down and writes letter
But the letter must be written to somebodyyou cant sit down and begin My dear Sir with any conviction unless there real dear Sir somewhere at the back of it all and thats where come in
lend just the necessary amount of reality to the whole thing
Have you been at the business long
Ever since left school
It been handed down in our family from father to son for years and years
My own youngsters just started in the Midland Members of Parlia ment department
He showing lot of promise
Mr Austen Chamberlain thinks good deal of him but of course being in the Cabinet Mr Chamberlain mostly works through me
His father was regular gold mine to us especially during the fiscal controversy but there was no end of explaining going on then and we were kept very busy
dont quite see said where you make your profits
Oh that easy
We get the originals of the letters and after time we sell them mostly in America
There big market for that sort of thing there
Of course the prices dont run quite so high since typewriters came in but it fairly steady all the same
Anyhow it keeps me in beef and beer and pudding and you cant want more than that can you
Actually of course could but at this moment we drew up at Paddington and left it at that
NEW WAY WITH OLD CLOTHES
Men can save by having fewer changes of costume and by spend ing less on golfing or holiday suits or other clothes for occasional wear by having their suits and overcoats cleaned and repaired instead of buying new ones by spending less on gloves and ties and by having still serviceable boots mended instead of buying new ones
Why we must Save and Sow
Parliamentary Savings Committee
In tranquil antebellum days when ordering suit Involved no fiscal problems that were serious or acute My wardrobe was constant source of family dispute
Against my passion for old clothes my estimable wife Supported by my daughters waged
neverending strife It was indeed almost the only worry of my life
They used to hide away my old unfashionable tweeds Oblivious of my comfort and regardless of my neads They banned my pipe but never once objected to my weeds
My ancient ties of faded dyes excited their disdain My threadbare dinnerjacket caused them veritable pain And they criticised my boots in language less polite than plain
They heaped sarcastic obloquy upon my caps and hats They made me birthday presents of the most expensive spats And the latest thing in handkerchiefs in collars and cravats
In short in halfadozen ways they diligently biffed My laudable intentions to promote domestic thrift Until the struggle threatened to produce serious rift
But War though vilely fruitful in sorrow and distress For one small salutary change am inclined to bless At last am allowed perfect latitude in dress
My ancient clothes misshapen boots disreputable ties No longer find disfavour in my wifes and daughters eyes But on the contrary evoke their warmest eulogies
Nay better still themselves released from giddy Fashions goad They follow me with docile steps along the frugal road That leads to perfect freedom from the tyranny of Mode
Retreats for Army Chaplains
The value to the spiritual work of chaplains with the forces in the fighting line of day spent in retreat must be obvious as also are the dimculties of arranging such opportunities
Church Times
Surely the enemy if they knew would oblige with little extra pressure which might produce the desired retreat

OUR BOOKINGOFFICE
By Mr Punchs Staff of Learned Clerks
take it that Mr Maurice Hewlett designed his new Dovel The Little Iliad Heinemann frankly as grotesque an opinion in which four exceedingly quaint illustrations by Sir Philip BurneJones distinctly confirm me
The story is in quito an original vein the interest and mystery very adroitly sustained
We are given gruesome picture of physically wrecked but still indomitable sensualist de plorably dragging shuffling feet Baron von Broderodc married to very beautiful and gracious woman who had been caught young from out convent
Enter Sector MaUeson an egregious sentimentalist heir incidentally of Highland chieftain
He diagnoses an Andromeda dragon situation thought which apparently had not occurred to the Baroness who however cordially accepts the suggestion and is made profoundly miserable
Eventually she flies and finds asylum at the headquarters of the Malleson clan where three other sons of the house as also the old chieftain himself fall hopelessly in love with her
Comes the relent less Baron in pursuit and how this modern Menelaus first wins then loses the game and where the fair Helena finally bestows her widowed hand must leave Mr Hewletts diverting little Iliad to inform you
can promise you good entertainment and though as have hinted the thing is planned in freakish mood the author has not let himself off the honest labour of construction and polish
His sympathies are throughout with his wicked Baron who is very new version of the strong silent hero and may fairly be considered sport
What refuse to believe about him is that even though he shot from pony cart he got his gun up like lightning and fired at the instant consider ing the painful struggles he bad to get his wineglass or cigar accurately to his mouth pathological details that Mr Hewlett has been at pains to rub well in
Something will really have to be done about it
If many more of our novelists take to turning out these prodigiously long stories we reviewers will have to agitate for payment by piecework
The latest exponent of the gentle art of garrulity is Mr Temple Thurston with his new novel The Achievement of Bichard Furlong Chapman and Hall
There are seven hundred and twentyeight pages of it so that when you have turned the last of them you may perhaps feel that the achievement is not exclusively con fined to the hero
Bichard Furlong was painter and etcher and the object of Mr Thurston is to trace his progress from obscurity to fame but though he is repre sented as doing lot of artistic work in bis spare time it would be more fair to say that the real successes of Bichard were gained in the domain of what might call wishing to put the matter as delicately as possible unceremonious polygamy
Erom the moment when he runs away from the paternal mill and joins the company of Mr Thurstons other heroes in picturesque slumexistence round about Drury Lane his career becomes sentimental journey from one affair to another
dont want to say that there are PUNCH OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
September not pleasant passages in the book there is always certain jollity in tale of success bub do think that justice could have been done to the theme in smaller compass
In his preface Mr Thurston tells how he came to abandon his intontion of publishing three separate books about Richard Furlongs history and to bind them instead into one volume
My only comment on this is that it remains true that three of his furlongs make at least mile
During the last twenty years Sir Gilbert Parker has written dozen novels
At such stage fancy is accus tomed to flag and kind hearted friends are apt to regret that the author has written himself out
This makes more pleasant the discovery that in The Money Master Hutch inson Sir Gilbert surpasses himself
The story opens with the introduction of Jean Jacques Barbille miller and money master commonplace man inclined to vanity buzzing with consciousness of worldly prosperity built up by himself
On voyage homeward bound from Europe where he was disappointed hen he entered Notre Dame or great building like the Law Courts at Eouen that people didnt whisper to each other Here comes Jean Jacques Barbille he made the acquaint ance of Spanish beauty slim and longlimbed Diana
He married her or to be precise it was she who married him for comfortable home and relief from penury shared with scamp of father
The Reader student of human nature with mature know ledge of its frailties knows at once what will happen
The beautiful sensuous Carmen bored with the dulness of daily life in company with Jean Jacques early succumb ing will go off with another man
The Reader is right
What he does not yet know but should take the earliest opportunity of learning is with what masterful skill with what touches of pathos the dull man miller and general dealer his dross purified in the fire of adversity is slowly step by step transformed into hero of sublime unselfish ness
Nearly every page of the story certainly every chapter reveals the inventive resources of the author
These never fail and the reader is with growing interest hurried on to the unexpected denouement
The world of Jean Jacques village which the censor may permit refer ence to as somewhere in the neighbourhood of Quebec is peopled with diversity of characters whose acquaint ance and environment are refreshing after long course of ordinary novels
grievance that the American has against Englishmen is that they pay visits to his country and then try to put it all into single book
He holds that America is too large thing to be put into single book
Yet in Turmoil odder and Stoughton Booth Tarkington has come very near succeeding in this feat
Turmoil for all that it has only three hundred and twelve pages covers the whole oE one side and that the most characteristic side of American life
It puts into words better than anyone has ever done before the American ideal of Bigness its obvious faults and its less obvious merits
We must be Bigger
Get people here
Coax them here
Swindle them into coming
Deafen them into coming
Any kind of people
We must be Bigger
We want Bigness
That was the motto of the tow in which Bibbs Sheridan lived and it was the motto of James Sheridan his father and Bibbs by nature poet and dreamer of dreams found himself forced by circumstances to kill his dreams and plunge in and blow and boost and brag with the rest until at length there came to hearten him the realization that hidden beneath all the boosting and bigness there was certain something that was also poetry of kind
In the United States Turmoil has had vogue that recalls the days of the old bestsellers those strange pro ductions which it resembles only in its popularity
It is easily the best novel that Mr Tarkington has written
Thero are flashes of the humour that illumined his Penrod stories but for the most part the author is grimly in earnest as befits his theme
It is story to be read by all who would un derstand the soul of the country that has produced skyscrapers and Pittsburg and the Chicago slaughterhouses
Man alive
this is Gods country and blind man couldnt help seein it
You certainly stand up for your own town if you stick to sayin you rather live there than you would here
You sure are some patriot to say that after you ve seen our city
show you something now thatll make your eyes stick out
Thus Mr James Sheridan to European visitor and that is America in nutshell
PEOPLE WE NEVEB MEET

There is real stuff as opposed to stuffing in Miss Will cocks Change Hutchinson
In truth her material is better than her pattern which is rather casual and formless
She loaves loose threads abandons even promising beginnings certainly crowds her embroidery frame with too many figures
But you read her story and comment without skipping get pleasure of her characters who really seem to be alive and doing and answer for it you be willing to put up with little defects of form for sake of such fine substance as the patient and indirect wooing of little brown Bess Latimer the orphan by the Professor charming piece of delicate romance
There is background of Starrs folk whose blood was older and bluer than their purses were long and who were little too conscious of other peoples essential inferiority
It is part of the defect of Miss Willcocks method that one cant make out just what the chango was which one supposes from her title to be the motive of her work
She gives me the impression of not having quite found herself even yet
But she will and meanwhile she has the heart of the matter in her

CHAPTER ONE Just Call Me Rat LIFTED the phone
The voice was low husky and evidently disguised

Who wants to speak to him Not soul wants to speak to him came over the wire
Youre Dean Con don
Well give him this message
Its from friend can get him right here and Who is it Say if you want to do the talking all Vee Brown Novel by Carroll John Daly Author of The Murder Syndicate etc
The man turned Its quick job for you too lady Friday the ththat was the night on the Murder Syndicates crime calendar which had been picked for the final blood coupa coup that was due to net millions for the death master
And that was the night Detec tive Brown went beserkfor Gertrude la Palatin was scheduled to go up on the wall living picture of the Syndicates red revenge on the Crime Machine
right if you want to listen to some im portant news about the Murder Syndi cate why Yes yes fairly shot the words in
Im listening Well button up the mouth then the voice went on and somehow got the impression it was an educated man trying to talk as if he were not
Ive got tip spill it to Vee Brown
Gertrude la Dime Detective Magazine Palatin is going to be shot to death just before the evening performance
Did you hear that Yes heard that
By whom Boy The laugh was harsh cackle
Youve got all the questions and Ive got the answers
By the Murder Syndi cate
Just guy sent by the Murder Syn dicate
You want his name
Dont breathe so hard or you cant hear it
His name is Wallace
Big Boy Wal lace
Youve heard it before And had heard it
It was the man Vee and the police were scouring the city to find
Known to have committed at least three murders suspected of committing dozen
Arrested as many times brought to trial once
But there was no evidence against him then no witness at least who could be produced
The man who was famous for beating the rap for mur der
Therefore he was valuable to the head of this Murder Syndicate
But Big Boy Wallace had bad habit habit that didnt break out more than once year
He liked to hit up the liquor and he liked to swagger and he hated his enemies
So like all criminals Wallace made the big mistake
While half seas over he came face to face with man he had hated for years
And Wallace forgot his surroundings forgot he was on crowded thoroughfareor didnt care
Anyway he shot the man to deathbe fore many witnesses seven of whom had already identified his picture
TIG BOY WALLACE was wanted man wanted more than any man in the city
The papers were riding the de partment for three innocent bystanders had been shot and one had died
The police wanted Wallace just for murder
But Vee Brown wanted him for more than that He wanted him because Wal lace knew the head of the Murder Syndi cate
Brown didnt know that
But he knew that the head of the Murder Syndicate had made mistake
He gen erally chose his murderers carefully through others so that he would not be known
Now he had not chosen care fully and Wallace in some way had dis covered his identity
Yes Wallace could name the head of this Murder Syndicate and Brown was sure that he would
Vee had received his information straight from Gertrude la Palatin who in turn had received it from the jeweler Ulrich Rossimire just before Rossimire was killed
But the man on the phone was still talking
Listen he went on
Get ev ery word of this for Brown
Its some mouthful
dont want that dame getting knocked off Ive spent too much money going to see her shows
Brown is ex pected at her dressing room at eight oclock
The Murder Syndicate is going to drag him off with fake message
Tell him not to fall for it Big Boy Wallace will just appear at her dressingroom door shes expecting Brown and will let him in
Then he shoots her to death
Theres fire escape right outside that dressing room
Tell Brown to anchor on it watch through the windowand there is Wallace right in the bag
Mark this fellow
Im giving you the tip
Play it any other way and blooey like that Vee Brown loses Wallace and loses the girl friend and maybe loses his life
Re membertell Brown to play it my way And you wont tell me who you are so we can reward you The man hesitated long time then laughed
Im not that dumb
But Ill tell you why Im blowing the show
Ive been sucked in by the Murder Syndicate this leader has the goods on me
dont want to do jolt and while aint soft cant go for nailing guys up on walls
Wallace has me jammed up
Hell go for Red Friday anything
Im not guy who minds hard names as much as mind hard labor up the river
Im willing to rat out on this guy
So just call me Rat The receiver clicked across the wire
dropped the phone back in its cradle dashed to the music room burst in on Vee Brown
Its the Murder Syndicate again cried
Theyre going to kill Gertrude la PalatinPal And gave him the whole conversation as remembered it Brown came to his ieet Its the break he exulted
The break Ive been waiting for
Weve got him Deangot him at last
It always comes that way
stool pigeon lad that couldnt stand the gruesome murders
lad He stop ped looked at me rubbed his chin
Let me have it again word for word Tive times guess went over that conversation
While was talking the telegram came
Mortimer Doran wanted to see Brown at eight oclock at his house
Stupid Vee said then shook his head
Or is it
Try to get Doran on the phone
No nohe stopped me wefll go through with it
Dean but dont like it Dont like it
Why shant know He shook his head
Dont you think Ive been expecting an attempt on Pals life
Dont you think Ive had the theater guarded for these few performances shes giving
Why man couldnt get to her
As for Wal lace
Hes dumb and hard but hes killer
The worst kind of killer
Yet hell cover himself smell the coppers mile awayand wont come But if he doesnt come you wont But he will come Vee was on his feet
He will by God
Ill see to that if the tips on the level TjVVE minutes later we were speeding downtown in taxi
It was Saturday afternoon and there was matinee
We didnt drive directly to the theater
Brown climbed from the cab and we walked around the block
That will be the fire escape He pointed up at the rusted iron outside the old playhouse
Run your eye to it then straight from it up to the roof across the street
That would be just about in line
man could lie on that roof with highpowered rifle and being any land of shot pop us off nicely Its trapfor youfor us said
dont know
silly trap
Id spot it at once
Its stupid Dean
Thats why think its on the level He nodded thoughtfully
However Ill have cou ple of good plainclothesmen up on the roof
Well see Pal and talk it over And we did see Pal
Radiantly beauti ful she bounced into the dressing room from fresh triumph green eyes blazing lights as she threw her arms about Vee
Its the last performance tonight She dragged the wig from her head and tossed it across the room
only took the engagement because of Meyer he believed in me and started me you know
Then back to hunting down the killerthe head of this Murder Syndicate
Ive got hunch Vee
Im going to play it strong hunch
want you out of this
This foolish idea that you owe something to society forfor your past
Youve done enough and She put both her hands against his cheeks
Wont you hear the hunch since its about Inspector Ramseyand his being right for once All right if its possible that Ramsey can be right Its his playboy she said
The mil lionaire Teddy Melrose who lost all his money
He knew Broadway knew both Dime Detective Magazine the upper and under part of the city
Racketeers bankers racetrack touts dowagers
Hes been booked to pay by the Murder Syndicateand he cant
Ive got hunch that the head of this Murder Syndicate would like to use man like thatand with smileand perhaps girl like me Baloney said Brown
Ramsey used Teddy Melrose once and he ran like scared rabbit Then he told her about the phone call the plot to kill her
But why me
They never asked me for any money they know better She extended open empty hands
But it shows that the head of this Murder Syndicate is human after all
spoiled his plans killed his few trusted men nearly wrecked his racket which he hasnt been able to rebuild yet
Now for revenge where could he strike me harder than through you Her mouth puckered
bet you tell that to all the girls she said
TROWN tried to grin it was not success
He put his hands on her shoulders
want you to quit the show not play tonight
Dean and will lie on the fire escape No no She didnt stamp her feet just set both of them hard down upon the floor and faced Vee
It wouldnt work
thinkyes think you must be in love with me She laughed
Wallace would know those things cant be kept quiet
And if it would work wouldnt do it
Quit the show
Quit Meyer on the last nightthe big night Its for big purpose Palthe dis covery of the leader of this murder rack et
For can make Wallace talk
Its to save livesmany lives Her laugh broke in on him
Youre talking like child
Of course Id do it to save livesmany lives
But if Im here when he comes there is more chance of saving those lives
Ill stay right here Ill open the dressingroom door Ill spring the trap for you Vee didnt want to do it
She rushed on Youll be there on the fire escape with gun
You can watch Wallaces every movement
Why you have only to step through the window and there you are Brown rubbed hand across his mouth
guess youre right he said
They call me the CrimeMachine and and He stiffened drew back from her
Youll be absolutely in no danger
Ill have him covered from the moment he enters the room Tonight then at eight
Youll come from inside or outside From outside Vee said
Ill tip you off from the window before eight She grinned
With my experience in the underworld we can pull it off She curled her lip into sneer as she used to when she played the part of Myra the Girl of the Night
How about the cops
The place fairly reeks with them
Hell never come while they are here know Brown thought moment Ill call them off for tonight hope to God Im doing right She looked at him long time
Slim boyish they faced each other shoulder to shoulder
His black eyes were soft now his thin lips whimsical
Youre Vivian now She nodded em phatically and as if she liked it
Just writer of songs
VivianMaster of Mel ody and love you for it Then her mood changed she smiled grimly
hope tonight though that youre just Detective Vee BrownKiller of Men Black eyes grew narrow hard cold points showed
He opened his mouth but didnt speak
He took me by the arm
When we reached the door she said The revuemy revue
How goes it Rotten Vee said
It does nt go at all And suddenly brightening
Reh frriftay But tonight
After tonight will be able to write CHAPTER TWO Outside the Window YYTHEN we crouched on the fire escape that night Vee Brown said have nt tipped my hand to the police havent even said word to the Ive got boys on that roof of course for dont fancy being shot in the back looked into the room
Gertrude la Palatin sat under light smoking
It was getting very close to eight
Brown spoke again
Damn itl Dean never felt like this before
Im as nerv ous as star on her first night
And more to himself than to me wonder if Im half in love with the girl smiled but said nothing
Then tried How are you going to work it
liad thought to change my plans he said
See that closet
Well we could have hidden in there
If it was trap of any kindI mean trap for mewed have had the jump on them He shook his head
But decided against that
We can see every bit of the room from here and By God Dean shes won der
Look at her sitting there smoking and reading
And Ill lay you ten to one shes actually reading This as she turned page
Shes remarkable woman And stubborn as hell
Imagine want ing to run with that Teddy Melrose
Why the Murder Syndicate wouldnt The words died
He moved forward gently touched the curtains as the rap came on the door
Gertrude la Palatin came to her feet slowly laid the book down on the small table
Her movements were easy assured but the color had suddenly gone from her face
Her green eyes darted one quick glance at the window
Then she walked over to the door and opened it
The man wore black slouch hat long coat and muffler high about his neck
But even so recognized him
The flat features were those of Big Boy Wal lace
Neither of his hands showed both of them were hidden beneath the long very longblack topcoat
The girl played her part well
She fell back slightly muttered Oh and then was expecting someone else The man said Yes know
You were expecting Vee Brown and so cun There was queer sort of gurgle in his throat
If was laugh there was not much mirth in Hes in the doset eh lady
Theres hundred grand and getaway in this for me
Well see how your boy friend likes this Even as he spoke he threw open his coat
Then things happened with rapid ky that was astounding and left me silent stunned there on the fire escape my gun frozen tight in my hand
Wallaces coat just fell back and both Ms hands raised
His body swung almost with that single motion and before even realized that those hands held guna Thompson machine gunlead was vomit ing from its blazing glaring mouth
thought of Browns idea that we hide in the doset and my stomach completely turned over for was looking at that partly open doset door and the multitude of tiny holes that had perforated the wood from top to bottom
The man turned
Furtive eyes sought the window for one brief moment
He spoke to Pal even as he poked that Tom my gun almost flat against her chest
Its quick job for you too lady but There was roar
All hell broke loose in my head
Big Boy Wallace seemed to straighten
My eyes blinked shut and open hut just before Wallace dropped to the floor saw the blood coining from his ear knew that Browns bullet had gone Dime Detective Magazine straight itato the mans brain almost di rectly through his eardrum
We were in the room then
Brown dragged the Tommy gun from twisted dead fingers
DAL was rocking back and forth try ing to steady herself stretching out hand for wall that wasnt there
steadied her and she clung to me
Brown stood looking down at the body sadly
Pal spoke
Im all right
Im all right
Ive seen death before quick and sudden and She was crying as she pushed her tousled head against my chest
It was terrible when he died
thought for moment it would be me and then those eyeswatching me
Then they were sightless and he was dead Yes dead Brown said bitterly
The only man who knewand he died
If you had only quit the show let him come alone let The girl turned
Youre thinking of him then not of me
Youre the finest shot in the world youve said so your self Her voice raised
Then why not have wounded him shot him in the With the gun against your chest And that was all of that
The manager was there actors and actresses and stage hands all crowding in the little doorway
Then Meyer and the police
But it was who took Pal to another dressing room
It was who tried to comfort her
And her one thought was of Vee Brown
He blames me she sobbed
He blames me
He cant love me
He Pal stopped her Vees greatest ambition is to get the leader of this Mur der Syndicate
He cant work at his music he cant sleep
And tonight
Well if it were someone besides you he might have shot the gun from Wallaces hand
With you he gave it all up
All the things he had built on the capture of Wallace alive
All to save you He did
He did She gripped my arm tight
Thats true
He did
But hell hate me for it Then her maid dozens of other people
The police reporters cameramen and the medical examiner
And somehow the ex planation which must have started with Brown that Wallace came there to kill him because he was so dose on his trail
Meyer wrung his hands
There will be no show he spluttered
No show tonight
No one out there knows whats happened andandthey are hanging to the rafters Brown spoke
His lips curled and guess only Pal and got his meaning
Oh therell be show he said to Mey er
Quit on the last nightthe big night
He turned to the door
Pal came to her feet
Her little body stiffened her hands denched at her sides
She moved quickly to the mirror sat down dabbed at her face
She was smil ing when she turned to Meyer
Brown is right she said
There will be show After that What
Inspector Ramsey of the police
Morti mer Doran the district attorney
Slaps on the back for Brown applauseyes even begrudgingly from Ramsey
The City of New York wanted Big Boy Wal lace more than any other public enemy and it wanted him dead
Vee Brown had ddivered him dead
And Vee Brown wanted him living
could see his face when they praised him treated him as hero snapped his picture
How he had wanted Big Boy Wallace alive
We saw the show
And the audience didnt know until they left the theater that Big Boy Wallace ace of murderers had been shot to death in Gertrude la Palatins dressing room less than forty five minutes before the curtain went up
Gertrude la Palatin was superb
Red Friday CHAPTER THREE Death Threat fpWO weeks later Yee Brown was working at his secret trade and his shame as he so often facetiously called it
There was no doubt that he made more money on single song than he did in whole year as detective assigned to the district attorneys office
Now he was doing the lyrics for an entire revue in which Gertrude la Palatin was to star
As for me
sat in the living room just beyond the closed door of the music room and let my mind wander
My paper lay at my feet my pipe had long since gone out between my teeth as listened to the infrequent strumming on the piano
The Murder Syndicate
Crimelands latest racket
Simple and direct it had the police buffaloed the press brutal in its denunciation of the police
And Vee Brown
It had him working on Pals Revue
There were no two ways about it
Crime murder violence action all stimulated him to write music com pose those sentimental song hits under the name of VivianMaster of Melody
The Murder Syndicate
So simple so direct so vicious and sure
And its lead er now free from the possible chance of being caught was picking his victims with rare shrewdness
First the simple direct note that they were to pay certain amount of money
Pay or diethat was the threat
And to make it doubly effec tive murdered men were found on the streets of the city
The victims of this ghastly extortion received notes next day that the Syndicate had acted struck at one who did not pay or who had notified the police
Many had paid of course
How many it was impossible to tell
shuddered shook myself and remembered that it was not so long ago that Inspector Ram sey and myself had sat bound in chairs waiting to be nailed living to the wall of house and left there to die
We had nothing to pay
We were to be just an advertisement
Screaming heads in the papers that the Murder Syndicate had struck
warning picture lesson to those who would not pay
Our deaths hadnt gone through of course
Those who would have killed us had died by Browns gun
But the leader whose identity we did not know had es caped
And now he was waiting to strike again
The bell to the upstairs door to our penthouse rang
It was Mortimer Do ran
And behind his huge fleshy form was the muscular figure of Inspector Ramsey
They were grim determined looking
With them was third man
The district attorney generally an af fable man did not bother to shake hands with me courtesy that he seldom neg lected
Inspector Ramsey simply grunt ed said nothing
let them in didnt speak at first looked toward the music room
knew that Brown didnt like to be disturbed when he was working
But now no sound came from the music room
Mortimer Doran jerked thumb at the third man who followed them in
knew him of course
It was Teddy Mel rose the former playboy and millionaire who like shrewder and brighter men had lost his fortune
But he had been threat ened by the Murder Syndicatewith the hope guess that he could raise the money from his wealthy aunt in Phila delphia
He had been near death with us that terrible night while we waited to be nailed to the wall of the empty house
Mortimer Doran chased away all thoughts of my not calling Brown by his next words
Its another Condon
Another threat of death by the Murder Syndicate
Sev eral prospective victims have been good enough citizens and brave enough men to Dime Detective Magazine bring in their letters
want to see Vee saw them seated saw that our only servant Wong was already mixing drinks
Then walked quickly to the music room jerked open the door and closed it behind me
DROWN swung quickly from the win dow
He wasnt angry at the intru sion and broke out before could speak Its gone
Every bit of it gone
It was pounding in my head demanding to be thumped out and jotted down
Now hell
Its the inactivity He laughed sort of bitterly
If thats all thats worrying you for get it
The Murder Syndicate has struck again Struck
Black eyes brightened his slender fig ure jerked erect
By God you act as if you were glad Glad He seemed puzzled and then Well perhaps am
But not in die per sonal sense you mean
Certainly we cant catch the leader of this Murder Syndicate while he remains inactive
Hes got to strike Dean hes got to strike to be struck
Now what happened Nothing yet shook my head
That isnot murder think
But enough has happened to bring Mortimer Doran here with face as long as your own threat of death eh Brown rubbed his hands together
Thats something indeed thats something
It means Dean that our Murder Syndicate can no longer collect with simple warnings
It is neces sary to act But cane
Ramsey is here with him of course And Teddy Melrose is here too Brown frowned
He ran out on us last time after all his braggadocio about helping the police Vee said hes not used to murder and violence
In way am and after that ordealthat waiting to be nailed
alive to wallId have run out myself if were able to run Perhaps you would and perhaps this Melrose can be of some help
And almost as we reached the door Hes Ramseys pet Ramseys find
So sup pose Im against him from the start laughed
You cant blame him for wanting to stick close to the police No
cant blame him Dean for being frightened
But he doesnt need protection
The Murder Syndicate is purely business
They leave alone those who run with the police
They are out for easy money
But Ill see Mortimer Doran and our good friend Ramsey Mortimer Doran did shake hands with Vee Brown
His placid round face worked through many expressions
Then he said It happened again
The Mur der Syndicate is to strike tonight Seven people brought in letters He extended the missives to Brown
You dont have to be careful
The fingerprint expert has gone over them And found nothing Fpund plentybut it means nothing It seldom does Brown grinned opened one letter then the others handed each to me
They were all the same
Typed carefully and neatly
Sir You will have the amount stipulated in previous communications ready to be paid in cash by the next notice
We respectfully call your attention to the fact that small delinquent who has communicated with the police dies tonight His death will be rather horribleand we hope effective
May we call your attention to your morn ing mail for further details
Very truly yours THE MURDER SYNDICATE
Peculiarly worded threat eh Teddy Melrose shot in his fishlike eyes flashing at us through the film that clouded them
Did you get one this time Red Friday No
didnt Brown ran through all of them
We have some good citizens then Ramsey shrugged his shoulders
But how many got these notes and are pay ingor waiting to see what happens Well said Brown we have seven letters
Surely the Syndicate will not know that all of the seven men have come to the police
Some one of them will re ceive later note indicating the payoff Yes yes said Mortimer Doran
But what of this present threat
Some poor devil tonight
Must we sit idly by and wait until man is murderedhor ribly murdered Since we cant prevent crime let us sit down and wait for it to happen said Vee Brown
Youve taken every step as outlined it He grinned at Doran
The district attorney looked at Ram sey
Everyone is covered he asked
Everyone Ramseys eyes widened
So the suggestion came from Brown then
Well can account for every name on our listeven the ones supplied by the government TITELROSE raised his eyebrows
The federal authorities are in this Certainly Ramsey snapped
The department of justice is peculiar that way
They dont like the United States mails being used for threats of murder extortion or even blackmail Will you wait here Mr Doran Brown asked
Doran said as he moved toward the door My place is at my office
just wanted to let you know and see if you had any suggestion as to whom the victim might be Hardly said Brown
And with smile Wait
Im willing to bet there will be no murder tonight
Weve done every thing to prevent it Hell said Melrose
If he flunks out on this the Syndicate is through washed up after the last fiasco
Its wonder Brown he doesnt take crack at you attempt your life He did said Brown
He did And with the curving lips and flippant air that always annoyed me And found it quite amusing
You see shot his agent right through the center of the ear Ramseys mouth hung open
He start ed to speak then didnt
But he looked over his shoulder as the three men left The door had hardly closed when Mortimer Doran returned alone
That was true about Wallace then
You think the Murder Syndicate sent him Im sure of it said Vee
Now tell mewhy does Ramsey cart Melrose around with him WellDoran stroked his chin looked to see that the hall door was closed Melrose very nearly led him to this mur derer before
Between you and me think Melrose has received another threat or learned something Vee Brown frowned
Hes shrewd man he said
If he can make suck er out of Ramsey well and good And rubbing his chin He may have some thing up his sleeve
The reward is fairly big Doran nodded
Ludwig Loudons familyhe was one of the first to be found nailed upadded cool twenty five thousand to it yesterday and news paper jumped it another ten He rubbed at his forehead
wish theyd cut it out
Cant they see its not question of money Its question of money with Teddy Melrose
He makes no bones about that JIJORTIMER DORAN hesitated held his hand on the doorknob finally blurted out Its like this Vee
Teddy Melrose has been seeing lot of Gertrude la Palatin lately Dime Detective Magazine Yes
Browns thin eyebrows raised
Wellyon see its Tather well known that yon and she And suddenly clap ping hand down on Vees shoulder Shes fine girl and youre fine fellow and And said Vee
Certainly his man ner didnt invite further talk on that sub ject
But that didnt deter Mortimer Doran
And women will talk He paused then went on hurriedly
Not that think she would or that she hears any thing from you to talk about
But was wondering if Ramsey put Melrose on her And you were thinking said Brown that youd rather have the head of this Murder Syndicate caught by the As office than by Ramsey
Anything else Browns voice was abrupt
Doran stif fened then smiled
Nothing else along that lineexcept that Teddy Melrose is very engaging man Brown grinned
Dont yon worry about me or your office
Go home and sleep And sleep said the
With some poor devil about to fee crucified dont think there will be any poor devil murdered like that tonight
The police certainly should be able to prevent it
We dont know the intended victim thats true
But we should know the hired assassin tonight hope youre right
God hope youre right Mortimer Doran said with feeling
Everythings been done that could be done
Good night CHAPTER FOUR The Murder Syndicate TVHEN Mortimer Doran had gone Brown turned to me
Teddy Mel rose eh
Pal has picked strange com pany
Hes become sort of stool pigeon for Ramsey You know
Pal told you she was going to play him along
Shes as hot on this thing as you are as anxious to get the head of the Murder Syndicate
And Mel rose knows his way around
After all his interest may be in the reward
Theres nothing bad about Teddy Melrose
met him in better days
Hes selling invest ments now and understand that con sidering conditions hes doing well Nothing bad and nothing good about him Brown agreed
And suddenly Pal hasnt been around Oh come
Vee told him flat
You saved her life of course but you put her in the position of needing that life saved then practically blamed her for being there knowI know Brown was ir ritated
My name and picture in all the papers the hero of the city
Shot Big Boy Wallace to death while he held machine gun
feel like fool
dont know why but fed that the head of the Murder Syndicate is laughing at me has made fool out of me But how
Thats it
dont know how switched the subject
About this death tonight
What makes you fed it wontcant happen Brown hesitated then hurst out with Hes fiend Dean and quite capa ble of nailing living man to wall
But he hasnt acted himselfat least alone
Hes hired others
First it was just by passing along the name of the victim through Rossimire the jewder and the name of the criminal he had picked for the job
Later perhaps he made direct contact with his murderers maybe through Wallace maybe by phone certainly keeping himsdf unknown to them
Heres the point Dean
There are hundreds thousands of men in New York Red Friday City who will shoot man to death for price stick knife in him toss him from cliff beat him to death
But just how many of these criminals would nail living man to wall
man has got to be more than criminal to do that Hes got to be pretty vicious Right
degenerate madman and the occasional fiend who takes pleasure in inflicting horrible torture
believe our leader of the Murder Syndicate is such man man with hate of his fellowmen
Now how is he going to find men to kill like that
Certainly not just by chance
Hes got to use professional talent known criminals Brown paused
And such professional fiendishness is rare
Every one who would do such an actevery professional criminal mean who might be known to the head of this Murder Syndicateis also known to the police
Wallace was one of them and he is dead
glance over the police records located others prison records found us more
So we were able to make up list of thirtythree known criminals who would not be above crucifying victim
We ran down that list have been at it ever since Loudon was found so murdered in his own house
Six of them are dead eleven in prison four deported four in state hospitals for the insane
That leaves eight
Of those eight three have been lo cated out of the state and the other five have been shadowed day and night
Oh Im not saying the list is complete but it seems to me thatin hunting out men for his purpose criminals that are known and who will go to the lengths he demands this murder fiend will pick one of those men
There you are Dean
He has thou sands to choose from for murder but hes limited when it comes to nailing liv ing human beings to walls
If he ap proaches these men or if any one of these men try to actwhy we will get them tonight And you think this Murder Syndicate leader is one of these remaining five No said Brown dont
think hes man who has started from scratch
Well known in the underworld of course but not suspected as criminal
man who suddenly saw the idea conceived the Murder Racket and understands the fear and terror created in other victims of his extortion by such horrible murders
may be wrong but dont think so
It takes more than criminal mind to kill even an enemy like that
So dont think murder will take place tonight
Even if we dont know the victim we may know and so have shadowed the prospective murderer TROWN had hardly finished when the phone rang
went across to the table and lifted it
The voice was even steady slightly sarcastic and unnatural
Is this Vee Brown the great detec tive No said
But The voice said This is the Murder Syndicate After silence stammered The the head of the Murder Syndicate You may call me that But am all of it
The Murder Syndicate
Put that toy detective on if hes there Brown was already at the phone had taken it from my hand pulled me close to listen
This is Vee Brown talking His voice was calm even quiet The voice laughed it was even pleas ant laugh
have called to return your very kind favor My favor Certainly
You are evidently one of those rare bighearted persons who do ing an enemy good deed dismisses it from his mind
meanabout Wallace
Big Boy Wallace
Living he would have done me lot of harm
He was too care ful for me to kill so it was kind of you Dime Detective Magazine to do it for me
You see he knew who really am So you sent him to me to be killed Yes The Murder Syndicate went on easily
It was rather amusing
Im quite gambler
really didnt know which one of you would die
It hardly mattered did it
With Wallace dead he couldnt tell you with you dead Wallace wouldnt have you to tell He chuckled now
But liked the way it turned out
would have had to pay Wallace rather large sum of money for killing you
As it was got Wallaoe killed for nothing How could you be sure wouldnt take him alive The little lady would assure me of that and Wallacesshall say impetu ous nature
You see told him you would be in the closet moments pause
And do you know half sus pected you would be there just fool enough to improve on my plans Im sorry wasnt there to see it
But the papers gave most vivid account
They made man out of you while made sap out of me It was as if Brown thought aloud
Exactly Now wish to return the favor let you know where to find the body
Yes yesI know
Youve had seven letters from my clients and youve spent weeks trying to think as would think
The men professional criminals suited for my particular job And gruff ly Well you were right
Most crimi nals are fools thats why work un known
You made things difficult for me
Have your attention Yes Vee said in low voice as if he were afraid the man would hang up
Im listening quite carefully Good
But you forgot Mr Vee Brown that there are hundreds thou sands right in the city who will knock man on the head for very few dollars and deliver him at certain place
Oh abhorred the physical end of ita long pausebut nailed up mymy adver tisement and hes ready for exhibition tonight Browns head jarred back and so did mine
Who is he
Where is he He was hosiery salesman from Illi nois with wife and three small chil dren
So picked him Why Why
The papers will make it higger storymore pictures
The wife and children you know
And my clients will be more impressed
But it is only the beginning
Now the one big splurge
The Murder Syndicate will strike once more strike at one of the big names of die cityand so collect fortune But this man
Where is he Oh
Staten IslandMidland Beach
bungalow there
Now dont forget the big date
Friday the thirteenth
No no
Im not superstitious but many other peo ple are
like to work upon the imagina tion of people
Take care of Miss la Pala tin
Good night TEE BROWN put down the receiver and looked at me
was right he said
He made sap out of me
Got me to eliminate his greatest danger kill the one man who threatened his existence
But you said there wouldnt he any murder tonight any Brown turned on me
And was wrong he said
Just dead wrong And trying to buck up But hes come out Dean is doing the job himself
Theres something in thatsomething in that He was lifting the phone calling Morti mer Doran
It was scarcely nine oclock
remember the ride downtown the im patience of Brown on the ferry his standing there silent in the bow looking up at the pilot house as if to try to hurry the lumbering craft But as Wong our Chinese chauffeur and houseman drove Red Friday out through Stapleton we talked
was wondering said how this Murder Syndicatefor he calls himself thatknew so much about the police de partment about what you do And was wondering that too He shook his head thoughtfully said then Think of the effect this will have on those who have not paid If Mortimer Doran can keep it quiet out of the papers why Brown shook his head
Im afraid our murderer is too good businessman for that
Hell But whats this
Not police escort motorcycle cop had turned followed and hailed us
Youre Detective Brown he asked
Ive been sent out to direct you Then they found something They have The cop nodded in the darkness
We were called just few minutes before the district attorney tele phoned he was coming over You were called here on the Island Thats right
lad from the Clarion found the body
Said he got tip and came over
think his name was Clancey or Geary said and Brown agreed
As we followed the cop down the high way Brown said You see
He tipped off Geary
Told him the exact location and Geary had look at the body before he notified the police
Yes the Murder Syndicate will get its full share of pub licity
Frontpage stuff that no money could buy And we were there
We didnt have to follow the cop any longer
The lights of cars the movement of uniformed men the ambulance
And by the door of the boardedup bungalowfor the season was long since pastInspector Ramsey
Theres your hunch Ramsey jerked thumb toward the door
dont know what the boys who have been shadowing your suspects will have to say but gave orders to get me full report at once Thats right Browns voice was dead
But quite unnecessary
The lead er of the Murder Syndicate stepped out himself tonight Brown paused
Is it very bad Bad Ramsey swung on him
Ive been on the force for years never heard tell of anything like it
The hospi tal doctor says hes been nailed there for two days Dead that long looked at Brown
But it was Ramsey who spoke
did nt say dead His voice choked
said nailed there Hes been dead only few hours
Rigor mortis just set in Brown straightened stiffened turned toward the door
Ramsey grabbed me by the arm
Its no grief to me what you do Con don
But go in that house now and Ill take my oath you spend the best part of month wishing you hadnt CHAPTER FIVE The Man on the Wall TD AMSEY was right exactly right
did go in and did wish that had nt
There is nothing to tell nothing to write of what saw in that room
Let me simply say that went out sat on the single step that led to the rear porch and was violently sick and without shame
How Brown stayed in that room dont know but he did stay
When he left he was bending forward reading the words on the note that had been on the mans chest had read the big letters of coursejust the words THE MUR DER SYNDICATE
Cleary of the Clarion came over and sat down beside ma
got tip Con don he said
You know how news paper work is
And came right out found him like that
There was mes sage under the big printed words
It took Dime Detective Magazine me hell of time to write it down my hand shook like the devil
Listen to this
It gave the lads name and address and said he was planted there raving and screaming Thursday evening at eight fifteen
Fortyeight hours before he died
Listen to the rest of the note He produced small flash and read aloud from some notes he had made
This man defied the Murder Syndi cate
He did not pay
He went to tfie police
He is of little importance to any one but his wife and three children
On the thirteenth of the month the Murder Syndicate will strike at another one of the citys most prominent citizens
He has already sought the police sought the protection of the district attorney and Detective Vee Brown
This protection will not help him
Remember the date
Friday the thirteenth
One of the citys most prominent men
After that date the same fate the same death for all those who do not pay
You pay or you dieThe Murder Syn dicate Cleary finished folded the sheet carefully and put it in his pocket
Make anything out of it Condon If he thought to take advantage of my condition or not didnt know
only shook my head
Everything was turning over inside of me
Hell said Cleary this thing will raise stink to high heaven
It He swung looked around to the front of the cottage
Heres the Aold Mortimer Doran himself
Ill see if can get statement catch him off his guard just as he comes out And Cleary left me
lyTORTIMER DORAN left his own LTJ car and rode back to town with us
He was silent sunk far back in corner of the rear seat
couldnt stand the silence
Finally broke it said But Vee
Why all that stuff on the note
He never went to the police was never even threatened
What good does the note do then We know he didnt come to the police Dean but the men the Syndicate demands money fromGod knows how many of themdont know it
Theyll think our statement to the papers just an attempt to cover our own inefficiency Our own inefficiency Mortimer Do ran said
Perhaps they are right
So the murderer called you on the telephone called Cleary of the Clarion too There was leak Brown said
This Murder Syndicate knew of our sudden interest in certain type of criminal and was therefore smart enough to avoid con tact with any of them
Of course it might be possible to trace the man or men who delivered the victim to the shack but therere thousands who would do that for few hundred dollarsnot knowing the truth of course
Tomorrow when they do learn the truthwell its hardly possible that they will be anxious to talk and impossible that they know who the man was who hired them
But its the leak that interests me
If we could trace that Leak
Hell Mortimer Doran was jarred into animation
Youre talking like child
You know as much about police business as do and damn sight more
We must have used hundred men in looking up those records trailing men sending wires all over the country Brown nodded called to Wong to stop the car leaned out and bought paper from boy who was bellowing Extra He snapped on the dome light
We all looked down at that paper and all re mained silent for the space of full min ute hardly breathing
For there spread across the whole front page of the Cla rion was picturea photograph of the frightful thing had seen two short hours before
Red Friday Vee Brown said finally So Cleary had cameraman with him
He telephoned in his story and the lad rushed back with the plate even before Geary notified the police The skunk said Mortimer Doran
Brown shook his head
Hes doing his job just as Im doing mine and you are doing yours
His is to gather the sensa tional And to me You see Dean the inhuman monster you call mad saw to it that the advertising value of hishis murder was fully taken advantage of And theres no way to find him This from Doran as we stopped before his house
Only one can think of now Vee answered absently
Locate house where this picturehe tapped the front page of the paperis kept and framed and well have our murder monster Doran stood at the curb and looked at Vee
By Godl he said
Youre not trying to be funny Brown shook his head
Any man who could treat another human so with money the only motive must have the type of brain that would glory in keeping such reminder of his act And suddenly Theyll ride hell out of us in the papers but think the little salesman from Illi nois did not die in vain
think his death will lead to the Murder Syndicate How
Can give that to the papers am not surehow
But think knowwhen
hope to know positively tomorrow Mortimer Dorans voice was not pleas ant
You think you know when
When is that The end of next week Mr Doran
Friday the Thirteenth We were gone then turning across town toward Park Avenue and home
Vee said youre not just guess inghoping Both He looked at me in the dark ness
But Ill know tomorrow
If the Murder Syndicate runs true to form Ill know What do you meantrue to form WellBrown stroked his chinyou remember when Ludwig Loudon died
Each of the Murder Syndicatesshall call them clientsreceived letter the following morning and the letter an nounced the name of their victim and what time the body would be discovered remember nodded
Several brought in their letters
But theres little hope there
The Murder Syndicate was wise enough to mail those letters so they would not be delivered until long after the victim was discovered dead
You dont expect to trace the murderer back through those letters or letters that peo ple may bring to the police tomorrow No said Brown
But Ive got an ideaan idea dont believe even the Murder Syndicate will think of He was opening the door of our apartment stop ping listening sniffing the air
We have he said visitor Who went clumsily for my gun
Who has key
Just PalGertrude la Palatin dashed into the room ahead of him
CHE was there stretched out on the couch
She looked at me smiled sent ring of smoke toward the ceiling
It was the tobacco then that Vee had smelled
She took my hand squeezed it winked at me as Vee entered the room
If he was glad to see her he didnt show it
He said So youre not working with me any more
That it Not with you but for you She sat up now
If the mountain wont come to MohammedReally Vee thought youd have more nerve and come around He stood and looked at her his face hard his lips tight his eyes black gleam Dime Detective Magazine ing slits
Then he smiled
Damn it
think Im jealous Of Teddy Melrose She came to her feet
love you for that
Andyes its not Vivian the song writer whos jealous
Its the coldblooded killing dick Vee Brown
Id have believed He grinned then
dont like him
Hes playboy gone broke
Where does he get the money to take you around
Not from his aunt No She shook her head
And not from Ramseythat is all of it
Believe it or not Vee Ive been footing most of the bills Vee frowned and when she waited Yes
Tell me about it
didnt think he had come down that far
Hes making some moneynot lot but some Hes not gigolo if thats what you mean Pal told him
He made me straight business offer
went out with him first to find out what could about Ramsey
Melrose isnt bad sort Vee
He talks of building up his fortune again
Just needs money to startone big bank roll
And that roll he hopes will be the reward money for the capture of the head of the Murder Syndicate But Pal hes useless
He was threat ened got letter telling him how to pay and he and Ramsey and Dean went through with it and nearly died
Teddy Melrose broke loose and ranjust as saved them
He hid like scared rabbit outside the house we picked him up later with the car Gertrude la Palatin said While Ted dy Melrose was hiding someone came to the window of that house and that some one was the leader of the Murder Syn dicate
He shot through the window and killed Ulrich Rossimire just as he was about to tell you the leaders name
Re member that Id hardly forget it said Vee
So what And Pal threw her bombshell
Teddy Melrose told you he saw man running from that window but he didnt tell you just how near he was to that man or that he saw the mans face God no Brown swung half shook the girl
His eyes blazed
No he didnt tell me that
He recognized the face The girl grinned
Now arent you glad you didnt scare me out of this racket Come Pal Vee sat down on the couch
It isnt the time for nonsense Sol Ill tell it from the beginning
Ramsey sicked Teddy Melrose on me
Ramsey more than suspects was active with you in various cases and he found out that was often with Ulrich Rossi mire
Teddy Melrose told me that the second time he took me out
He put it very bluntly and very straight
Im sent out after you by Ramsey and youd better watch him he told me
He thinks youve got some kind of past but isnt sure
NowI know youve got past
mixed around pretty much and knew most of the big shots in the rackets
If Ramsey knew what know about you hed send you back to prison Brown jarred off the couch
Teddy Melrose knowsknows you escaped from prison See Vee cut in
You were going to fix that with the with the gov ernor
Now HPHE girl said He didnt say he knew and he didnt threaten to send me back to prison
It might have been blackmail but he made it very much of business proposition
He thinks he recognized the head of the Murder Syndicate and of course realizes that hell have to have evidence
He told me that he was prac tically broke suggested that pay our expenses travelling around the hot spots until he saw the man he thought he recog nized again
Then was to meet this Red Friday man go around with him get the evidence or at least find out what could And you were to split the reward money suppose put that one in
Pal laughed
He wasnt that generous but he did promise to reimburse me for our little dinners and suppers out of the reward He warned you of course against saying anything about this to me Pal puckered her lips
Thats the strange part of it
He didnt
He simply suggested that say nothing to you until we were ready to strike
Then he wanted me to tell you
He says you dont like him Vee
But he rather likes youat least believes in youand trusts you enough to take your word that if the arrest or the killing is yours the money is his And if you wouldnt agree he threat ened to tell what he knew of your past No she shook her headhe didnt
He just seemed to think me fitted for the job thats to be done
But he made no threats
But suggested threats eh She seemed to think moment
Im not sure that he did
Hes cold blooded as hell Deanno doubt about that
Won ders if we stall off while will the reward be larger
Cynical too but thenhes set on getting back at the friends who de parted with his money
He told me Vee that hes suggested investments to people that netted them fortune and now they wont even recognize him just give him quick nod
It seems almost like an obsession with him Sounds sort of childish Vee said
Yes it does
But its understandable What did you agree onwith him Well Pals lips twisted slightly took him up paid our way
And And Vee encouraged
And tonight had dinner with the suspect the man Teddy Melrose saw run ning from the window after Ulrich Ros simire was shot dead at your feet was startled and shewed it Brown was startled too
His name Vee gulped
You know his name Of course she said
Johnny Fitz patrick DONT know why laughed but did
Maybe it was because of the in congruity of the name
Hardly one youd pick for the name for fiend
Brown said Johnny Fitzpatrick
Well known in the rackets smartest and most dangerous of aH the exbootleggers Was he on your list asked
No no
He wasnt And the last man Id think of putting there
He cashed in with Repeal and understood was Irving on preRepeal profits
But he never
It seems incredible
Pal said Thats what told Teddy Melrose after met the man
Hes rather nice rather quiet
little gray around the templesand seems glad to be out of it all And what did Mdrose say
Melrose said there had to be first time for everything
That few years ago it would seem impossible to him to be sitting there letting me pay for his food and wine And hes right
Brown finally nodded
Yes theres got to be first time for everything
Youll have to cut it Pal youre in great danger
If Teddy Melrose has found the right man And knew Vee was thinking of the message of the Murder Syndicate that had come over the phone
Take care of Miss la Palatin
cant quit it Green eyes flashed
Youre afraid of Mdrosethat hell talk about your past
Thats why you cant quit dont think so she said
think its something stronger than that Its the Dime Detective Magazine past itself Vee
keep telling myself that its over and done with but it isnt
Its there after the years
There are times when want to open my window and yell it for all the world to hear
Im crook
Ive been in jail
Im sham and No no
Its as if Id been seeking freedom and now feel that Im finding it She clenched her hands
know what happened tonight She pointed toward the radio
It came in over the air
Im going through with it
Ive got to go through with it
Ive got to know hes caught or dead
Then Ill be free She turned fled toward the hall and the door swung back
wanted to tell you wanted you to know ifif anything happens to me Brown let her go without making move to stop her
He simply took the Clarion from his pocket and looked long and steadily at the picture
She has to do it Dean he said after while
In way shes like me
The things gripping her tearing inside her body
Something she cant get rid of
Ive killed menmany men
By God Dean
Id die willingly tomorrow tonightif first could have that mon ster lying at my feet and pump lead into his stomach said without thinking without mean ing anything Why in the stomach He said simply enough Because it hurts more in the stomach CHAPTER SIX The Letter rpHE next morning Brown was up early
We had visitor
He was an excited nervous little man who had inherited money and lived out on Long Island
His name was Seymour Brentwood and he looked every letter of the name
He was talking when came into the room
hope the things not joke Mr Brown
hope one of the neighbors wouldnt perpetrate such joke
YetI came to you becausewell didnt want my name tossed about in the press
My wifes Stevens you know
The Massa chusetts Stevens
Her family wouldnt like it bit Did you show it to your wifeany one No didnt Though the room was not warm the man rubbed great beads of perspiration from his head
Its ghastly joke though
had just read my paper when the note came Brown had passed the note to me and was reading it
Dear Mr Brentwood You have already read in your morn ing paper of the unfortunate and horrible death of Janies Francis Stacey in the shack on Staten Island
If you will ex amine the post mark on this envelope you will note that the letter was received in the United States post office several hours before the dead body was found
You have been selected by THE MUR DER SYNDICATE to pay the sum of twentyfive thousand dollars in cash or meet the same unpleasant fate
Therefore it is necessary for you to get together that amount in bills of small denominations before noon on Saturday the Fourteenth of the present month
On that date you will receive in the first mail full instructions as to how to turn this money over to the Murder Syndicate
The papers no doubt have also informed you that on the night of Friday the Thir teenth very prominent citizen will die
On the morning of the Fourteenth you will receive letter telling you who this man is and the post mark of this letter will con vince you that the dead man was alive and well the very moment that letter to you was received by the United States post office
He has appealed to the police
But we have planned his death and nothing can save him
If after this man dies and you read the letter you are not convinced that our demands must be met we can give you but one more demonstration
That isto nail your own living body to wall
THE MURDER SYNDICATE
Red Friday You see the point dont you
Just as said But why doesnt the Murder Syndicate mail the letters sooner if they want to convince their victims the police cant protect the man Good old stupid Dean Vee ignored our agitated visitor
The thing is simple
If we knew the victim we could very easily protect him
Only the Murder Syn dicate knows the victim until after the crie has been committed
He has laid his plans picked his victim and is sure enough to name him in letter before he is killed or even taken by him
Partly conceit Dean but mostly good business
It is rather horrifying for those threat ened to know that when that letter was written the victim was alive and well
Also it impresses them with the Murder Syndicates inevitability
He did the same thing at the time of Ludwig Loudons death DROWN turned to the nervous little man
Its not joke Mr Brent woodfar from it he said seriously
He crossed the room and laid both his hands on the mans shoulders
You are for tunate in coming to me
can save your life and can save your money
You must not tell what was in this letter to anyone not anyone Vee folded the letter and put it in his pocket
If you obey that simple instruction promise you you will be quite safe But they saythe letter says hethis man went to the police and He pointed at Browns pocket If you notice the envelope that contained the letter its slightly blurred but the post mark is sixthirty
put magnifying glass on it You see Dean Vee half threw at me
The very fact that this Murder Syndicate can convince his victims that his letter was written some hours before the body was found strikes them with sort of awe terror
And of course they believe that the murdered man is not only known to the police but has sought police protection
Even such stouthearted citizen as Mr Brentwood feels the in fluence Iwell Brentwood stammered felt it duty to come
Im not afraid Mr Brownhardly that His laugh was shrill and false
But my wife you know
Her familythe Stevens
Good God
To be nailed to wall like that
Cant the policecant you Stop it
Certainly Brown nodded
You are in an enviable position Mr Brentwood
Upon your actions from now on until the night of the Thirteenth rests the life of man perhaps the lives and happiness of many menbut at least the life of the one mentioned in this letter Yes yes
But dont quite under stand Bent shoulders straightened slight ly
If he didnt get Browns words he got the tone of his voiceone of respect admirationand he liked it
And thats even nobler said Brown
Doing this for the good of your city and not fully understanding it
Your promise
You will do nothing
Act as you always acted Wellyes He took Browns hand
Dean take Mr Brentwood out the back entrance through the court and see him safely in cab got Brentwood as far as the door when he turned jerked his arm free made couple of false starts and finally got the words out
II want to do what can Mr Brown
But must think of my wife
II might draw the money from the bank
It will look like good faith That Mr Brentwood is your own business
shall treat your visit confiden tially as you requested when you came in
But if you do as say act your normal self and dont go around talking there will be no Murder Syndicate to pay Dime Detective Magazine the money to on the morning of Saturday the Fourteenth When got back to the apartment Vee Brown was rubbing his hands humming softly
Youll have to go back downstairs again
To let in Mr Wiley
You dont know him eh
Ive done business with him
You see hes about Brentwoods build age general appear ance
Theres just chance that the apart ment is watched and Brentwood was spotted coming in And you want this Wiley to come in the back and go out the front as Brent wood Not exactly
want him to go out the front as Wiley
If hes shadowed theyll know hes broker who has done business with me before GUESS it was full half hour later that Wiley had come and gone
After seeing him out the front entrance re turned to Brown with the information that man had slipped around the comer and followed Wiley in taxi
Good said Vee and as Wong came through with his bag Take it to the Newark airport Wong
Yes Dean thats right
Im making flying trip to Wash ingtona secret one too The upstairs halldoor bell rang
Go out the side entrance Wong after the gentlemen are in And to me when Wong had gone and Vee was starting for the door That will be Mortimer Doran and daresay Ramseywho is afraid may have found out something he missed And rubbing his hands Which have Dean Brown was right
Ramsey was with the and also Teddy Melrose to whom Vee was especially cordial
Im glad you came Mr Melrose
want to have word with you in private after Mr Doran and Inspector Ramsey leave Teddy Melroses eyebrows went up fish eyes stared
Yes he said
Mortimer Doran did most of the talk ing
Weve had visitors downtown
Inspector Ramsey was kind enough to call me in Brown let me read the letters Mortimer Doran held out
There were nine of them
They were all the same wordforword copies of Brentwoods letter
Only the amounts differed
thought there would be more than that Doran said
thought the Murder Syndicate with this threat about the Thir teenth was going into it wholesale Maybe he has Ramsey cut in
May be other men who got the same notes are scared stiff
Take these men here Ramsey tapped the letters
All of them well fixed and the amounts well within their means
It may be like that with many others and they intend to pay or just to sit tight and see what happens on the Thirteenth And with half sneer Mr
Doran tells me youve got things sewed up Brown so nothing will happen on the Thirteenth Perhaps have You were to let Mr Doran know for certain today understood Thats right You had any callers
Anyone with letter come straight to you Hardly Brown smiled
But Id like to interview the men who came to see you Ive got list of their names Ramsey gave it to Vee
Everything open and above board
Nowwhats your dope eh am expecting tip
Indeed Ive had the tip but Im expecting something else later in the day And turning to Doran Im sorry you spoke of this
In way meant it to be confidential Well Doran saidand Well again
had to say something Thats right Melrose spoke for the second time
Theyve given you quite Red Friday sendoff Mr Brown
Detective Vee Brown Killer of Big Boy Wallace to Ar rest Head of Murder Syndicate on the Thirteenth
Something like that
Early afternoon editions Brown looked at Doran
Doran shuffled his feet looked toward the ceiling
Then he suddenly blustered Yes gave it out
What the hell could do
The place was lousy with reporters
had to say something
And damn it
Ive given you your way in this case let you run things to suit yourself
Nowyouve got to make good Or youll take it out of my hide Friday the Thirteenth
Well dont blame you
So Sowhat Ramseys face shot for ward
Why Ill have to drag in the leader of the Murder Syndicate of course Youre going out and get him Not exactly said Vee and that twisted little smile was in one comer of his mouth
wont go out and get him
Ill sit down and let him come to me TNSPECTOR RAMSEY didnt like it
But Teddy Melrose stayed behind after they left
The door was hardly closed when Vee came back into the living room and stood facing Melrose
Melrose he said whats the racket Melrose smiled down at the diminutive detective
Thats all right he said
Miss la Palatin said she spoke to you And did you approve
Broad shoulders shrugged
Not exact ly
thought it was premature disclosing my suggestion Suggestion echoed Brown
And then You mean threat mean exactly what saidsugges tion You are in position to send Miss la Palatin to prison
You know that Melrose stiffened
am quite aware of that Then said Brown be quite aware of this
am very fond of Miss la Palatin moments pause
Maybe more than just fond of her
want to impress you Melrose
You blackmail Miss la Palatin open your mouth about her pastand Ill get you Youd kill me eh His eyes widened
By God
believe you would Believe it
blackmailer should Teddy Melroses right hand swung quickly
It was hard blow but not particularly well timed
Brown was always quick but now he only moved his head
The fist whizzed by harmlessly
Melrose grunted jarred back
He had not seenneither had Ithe gun that was there now in Vees hand planted hard into his stomach
Im sorry Mr Melrose said Brown but nature has not gifted me with great physical strength
wouldnt try another blow Melrose grinnedactually grinned
And it wasnt bad grin
Put up the gun he said
lost my head And when the gun disappeared with single quick motion There
can talk better
Im not blackmailer and didnt like the word
But see your point
Miss la Palatin can withdraw from our little understanding any time she wishes and need have no fear that Ill ever talk
To me it was simply business What do you want out of it want money
The crimes have been of ghastly nature
am shocked and horrified like anyone else
But Im not fool
want only one thing out of it He leaned forward now
want money all can getall the traffic will bear
want money
There you are
If you dont want Miss la Palatin in it get her out of itcome in yourself What about Ramsey What about him Melrose fairly flung the words at Brown
He thinks Dime Detective Magaxii hes using me and will drop me when the break comes if dont drop him first Does Ramsey know you saw this man He knows that saw man and he knows that think recognized that man
Im stalling Ramsey along He smiled
Im ostensibly trying to stir up my mem ory looking for the face saw TROWN nodded
So thats it
Thats why he didnt want me to see you alone Im not accountable to Ramsey Mel rose sort of stiffened
Nor to any man
But if you want to work with me Im willing
It seemed to me that through Miss la Palatinwho would finally con vince you was rightand then through you was the best way to work it
saw the man
know who he is
Its up to you to trap him or get confession out of him
cant do that Its Fitzpatrick eh
That seems un believable Maybe it does said Melrose
But thats the man saw fire the shot through the window that killed Ulrich Rossimire
Take it or leave it
You can have all the glory as long as get the money And after bit when Brown did not answer at once Call Miss la Palatin off if you want
Im not blackmailer
Ill never make trouble for her Brown shook his head
You dont know that girl he said
Shell never quit never lay down on the job Well Melrose said are you with me His eyes narrowed
Remember Miss la Palatin gave her word that Ill get the moneyall of it Brown extended his hand looked straight at Melrose
misjudged you guess
Yes you have my word
You get the moneyall of it Melrose held the hand moment finally dropped it How will you work it
Have him watched No not exactly
We mustnt make him suspicious
Well give him plenty of rope until next Friday night Watch him then when he goes to Melroses shudder was quite visible
tell you Brown there are times when Im scared You dont need to be
Youre too close to the police
The Murder Syndicate knows that
It would be sheer bravado to strike at you Melrose twisted up his face
Bravado or not it wouldnt do me much good if were deadlike that on wall There was more talk
Brown saying he would work it out and Melrose con tinually coming back to the question of money
And when he spoke of money he spoke of those who had robbed him
When he was gone Brown said You saw it too
Its not just greed
The man wants desperately to regain his lost place in the world
And this passion of his to start over to strut the city again may help us lot
If he went to Ramsey Ramsey with the papers at his heels would make the arrest and try to beat the truth out of Fitzpatrick You dont think it is Fitzpatrick Ive got an open mind Brown stroked his chin
You see its quite possible that the leader of this Murder Syndicate was not at the house that night and did not fire the shot through the window
Fitzpatrick might have done that yet not be the leaderand not even know who the leader is You dont think Fitzpatrick capable of How can we tell what man is cap able of
dont know what Im capable of myself
Look at it this way Dean
This leader is shrewd man and he knows that Gertrude la Palatin is very close to me
The moment he met her Red Friday wouldnt he suspect that suspected him
Granted that Fitzpatrick is this man would he believe it mere coincidence that they met
Would he have dinner with her or Hed kill her cried out suddenly
Would he Brown shook his head
Would he kill her when it was known shed been with him
Wouldnt that give to me tiie very proof seek
No he wouldnt kill her Dean
But if he isnt this leader then Pal may learn something
For if Melrose told the truththen Fitz patrick was paid by the Murder Syndicate to commit murder
Im off to Washington
Im worried about her of course but thats not good logic
Reason tells me shes safe safer than shes ever been And he was gone
EASON didnt tell me the same thing that it told Brown it didnt tell me anything at all
Things were so utterly jumbled
And thats how things stood if they did stand at all when Brown called me up from Washington and said hed have to wait over until Monday as the man he wanted to see was out of the Capitol for the weekend
It was Monday night when he came back and Tuesday night Pal had dinner with us in the apartment There was nothing new to tell about Fitz patrick
On the level Vee she told him seri ously dont know if hes onto me or not But he does seem to enjoy me And when Vee frowned dont mean just my company
Its as if he were laughing inside at something She leaned forward then
have date with him for dinner and the theater on Thursday
He told me he couldnt possibly see me Fridayhe had very important engagement He had popped that out
How did he look when he said it Browns voice was quiet but his black eyes flashed
He was smiling
Just smiling and nod ding at me almost as if it were confiden tial Brown got up and paced the room
If hes in this thing the mans fool to act like that to say what he did And after pause Fitzpatrick never was fool CHAPTER SEVEN The Monster Strikes atmosphere of tenseness and horror hung over the entire city
At least it seemed that way to me
know didnt sleep much and when did Id wake up with start bathed in perspiration with picture in my mind that only long pac ing of the room and numerous cigarettes would erase
The papers kept the thing on the front pages
If the Murder Syndicate wanted advertising they certainly got it
Such threat such menace had never hung over the city before
There were numer ous pictures of James Francis Stacey his wife and children
And Vee Brown
had trouble getting him even to make semblance of acting on the case
But did persuade him to go and interview personally every man who had come to the police with letter
Its waste of time
Dean he argued
But youre right
Ive got to do it
It would seem strange to the head of this Murder Syndicate if didnt and make him suspect that had visitor of my But what can your visitor do to help that the others cant lot Dean
whole lot
Somehow this monster knows who goes to the police and who doesnt
He lays off those who do
And dont want him to lay off our little friend Seymour Brent wood That was early in the week and Brown Dime Detective Magazine had not told me why he went to Wash ington nor could think out the reason
Pal called us up every night and twice during the day
She promised Brown that
She was still going with Fitzpatrick and was now thoroughly convinced that he was not only not the head of the Murder Syndicate but had nothing to do with it
Thursday night and the papers still carried the storythe distress of the widowthe loss of an adoring husband and worshiping father
As matter of fact Brown told me Stacey was neither good husband nor good father
He neglected his family
They were half clothed and half fed
He made good salary but he spent plen ty when he came on to the city
He liked to run around
Thats the reason he wasnt missed
It was nothing for him to disappear from his hotel for days at time
daresay some dame picked him up delivered him over to the boys who finally brought him to Staten Island
He leaned forward suddenly
Do you know what did in Washington No said eagerly
And then If youre going to tell me go ahead if youre just going to talk around things why Im going to tell you
went to see the postoffice authorities the big gun
Do you know what wanted
Dean And when didnt Lets go back to the death of Ludwig Loudon
He was killed well after midnight
The next morning several prospective clients of the Murder Syndicate received letters saying that Loudon would die and those letters were postmarked early in the evening before his death
With Stacey it was different
The letters were not only posted long after he was taken but four to six hours before he was found
With the next victim the Murder Syndicate has promised to send its letter while the man is alive and free
You see the point confessed that didnt XTEE stroked his chin
Well if could have one of those letters in my hand naming the prominent man to be mur dered while the victim is still free could prevent his murder
Not only pre vent the murder but catch the Murder Syndicate right in the commission of his crime But how Vee was puzzled
The letters are never delivered until the next morning
The victims of the extortion dont get them until long after the man is deadand found No they dontbut Uncle Sam does
They are in the United States post office
Thats what went to Washington about
want just one of those letters naming this prominent manbefore he is taken and killed But how BrentwoodJ
Seymour Brentwood
want that letter as soon as it is received in the post office
See Dean
If have the name of the next prominent victim to be nailed up and have it before the crime takes place dont have to go out and find the monster who runs this Mur der Syndicate
can wait until he comes to me wait with the prominent victim He grinned crookedly
Cancan the postal authorities do it Thats what asked myself Brown nodded
But let me tell you
talked to big manhis name would surprise you
He listened lifted his phone talked to several people
Finally he turned to me
He said Youll have your letter Mr Brown
Youll have it five minutes after it is received at any post office
No ifs and buts Dean
straight statement But if the victim is already taken According to Brentwoods letter he would be alive and well
And they couldnt have taken him now
Dont forget this is to be prominent man
If he were missing any length of time the family would be worried his business associates Red Friday and the police would be notified
Its not sure thing
But think the Murder Syndicate will run true to form this time
Its their big knockover
The payoff You have told Mortimer Doran No one no one but you
We wont have any leak this time But the government might Vee grinned
Thats one thing about the federal governmentthey dont have leaks
was assured of that but didnt need to be
You see Dean they were as much interested in this case as am He frowned
Thats the one thing didnt like didnt like at all
Its really oneman job And with nod when would have cut in twoman job for Ill want you of course
Im no good without an audience Dean
But they in sisted on having an operator with me
There was nothing to do about that
Ive met him and you wouldnt ask for better man
DROWN glanced at the clock
Al most one he said and we havent heard from Pal
And the phone rang
There she is
No coincidences eh He lifted the phone and saw his face change
He said Yes then Yes again in low voice
leaned forward listened
It was the same rough voice disguised very unnaturalthe head of the Murder Syndicate
So there you have the picture Mr Brown
The little lady has disappeared
But dont worry about her yet
Really havent time to bother with her nowbut will after tomorrow night
Im afraid you didnt exercise any too good judgment as to her company
Melrose you know was not overcareful about his friends
He may have introduced her to most unde sirable acquaintance Is she alivenow Browns voice was hollow
Oh yes quite alive
Disturbed per haps mentally for she must guess what her curiosity andassociation with you has brought her
But indeed alive
Im not simply going to kill her
It will be interesting
have never experimented with women
wonder if they take it as wellor should say as badlyas men
What did you say And when Brown did not answer Yes am going to nail her up conscious and shrieking for you to find
You killed my men spoiled my plans almost ruined every thingincluding my reputation for pro tecting those who aid me
Now youve brought me out into the open made me work alone
If thats what you want how do you like it
Ill make you pro miseyes promise
You will be the first to see her body nailed there like the others Brown didnt speak
guess he couldnt
And by the way
Dont have police hunt If you do will know and act at once
Shell go up first You intend to go through with the other tomorrow night voice spoke close to my ear knew it was Vees for saw his lips move
But it didnt sound like his voice not bit like it Have ever disappointed my clients
You lost me thousands of dollars Mr Brown
This time will get millions
First our prominent man then our famous actress
Im little ashamed of myself Mr Brown
pride myself on being businessman
Yet this woman But we all have our weakness
bit childish eh
Just hate of you perhaps
Though set myself up as syndicate Im afraid am human after all And Brown broke loose
Human He cursed and threatened
Just beast There was false sort of laugh over the wire
And thought you were cool calculating killer
You knowI hardly believed it with such conceit as yours but think youre in love with the girl Dime Detective Magazii And suddenly If you make one move out of your house one move on the public street Ill put her up at once There was the click of the receiver and Vee dropped into chair
He was on his feet almost at once though calling Pals apartment speaking to the maid
Then he turned to me
Shes not there
Hes got her This as if he hadnt really believed it He took the drink gave him gulped it quickly reached for the second then hurled it into the fireplace
Its some thing that cant be drowned
need the stimulant but need clear head more
was fool
should have dragged her away locked her up put guard over her
And then suddenly turning toward the door grabbing up his coat You can come with me if you want It was no use to argue with him though did remind him of the mans threat if he moved out of the house
Thats because hes afraid might learn something
HesAre you com ing WHAT night
One spot after an other as fast as taxi could take us
Brown had just one thing in mind
He was looking for Johnny Fitzpatrick
He was like man in daze but he didnt make his search pointed
Just in and out of places
Every once in while he telephoned Pals apartment
The last time he came from the booth frowning
She rang up
The maid was sure it was Pal herself
She told the girl not to worry about her that shed be away for day or so
By God someone must have held gun to her head But why have her telephone at all The Murder Syndicate didnt want policehunt started guess
And it wasnt the maids calling the police that he feared but someone from outside calling Pal and the maid saying she didnt know where she was
Oror He grabbed my arm looked wildly at me
Funny DeanIm hunting the city tonight with single purposeto find Fitzpatrick and shoot him to death
Yet cant under stand it for dont believe he did it And perhaps half hour later when we left one of the hot spots Youve let me act like fool
shouldnt be out like this tonight
IIDamn it
Well go and see Irving Small
He knows everything We had been to see Small before He knows nothing about this Murder Syn dicate said
didnt say word to Brown about his tirade that should have kept him home
knew how he felt and wouldnt argue that with him
It was dose to four oclock when we got Irving Small out of bed
Small was the smartest fence in the dty knew more about criminals than any other man and sold his information to Vee Brown
Brown hdd over his head twentyyear stretchwhich he conveniently forgot so long as Small was usefuland also paid generously for what he wanted
Now he backed the little man into corner stared straight into his eyes
Irving he said Ill give you ten thousand dollars for the name and where abouts of the head of the Murder Syn dicate Irving Small spread his hands far apart
Id tell you if could Mr Brown you know that
Most any of the boys would turn him up for thin dime
Hes not of the city not of the rackets
Its oneman show And when Brown just stared at him know how he works but its through different people
He knows the big crooks approaches them over the phone or through others
They dont know who theyre working for until well like that last one the lad found on Staten Island
He uses many aliases
Red Friday No one would work for him knowing Small this is known only to Dean and myself
Miss la Palatin has been snatched by the Murder Syndicate Miss la Palatin
Mr Brown she By God
Then know who did it TRVING SMALL crossed the room locked the door went over and peered at the windows not out them peculiarly at them
You know Brown was eager
He was after the little old man shaking him
Maybe dont know but might guess
For Gods sake Mr Brown
You wont do anything until youre sure Vee set his lips tightly
wont do anything that will get you in trouble Irving Smalls head bobbed up and down
Theres man on the Avenue
crook that was gentlemana racketeer with word he wouldnt breakone of the straightest crooks the city has ever seen
Hes been away for whilesaved up and quit with Repeal
Well hes back
And hes been talking hinting that the Murder Syndicate had great racket and those who wouldnt pay deserved what they got
didnt believe it at first hed been such straight shooter but it came to me pretty straight
Then heard that he was taking Miss la Palatin around Yes Browns face turned milky white
His name You knew him
Youd hardly believe it
He must have lost his money
Hes hes His name
His name Brown shot the words out though he must have known what that name would be
His name said Irving Small is Johnny Fitzpatrick said to Brown You believe it now Yes yes Vee turned toward the door
must believe it now Irving Small followed him
If you see Fitzpatrick you wontwont tell him told you Vee Brown straightened his lips were long thin gash his black eyes burning coals
You dont ned to worry about Fitzpatrick he said slowly
When see him Ill shoot him to death We left the little pawnshops by the side door and went directly back to our apart ment
went to bed but didnt sleep
Twice went down the hall and listened at Browns door
He was pacing back and forth back and forth
CHAPTER EIGHT Red Friday TIHE next day Vee tried to talk up his own spirits
Just few hours Dean and Ill have him force out of him where Pal is being kept You heard him say he wouldnt harm her wouldnt hurt her until he was through with this prominent man He rubbed his hands together put those black eyes on meworried flicker ing eyes that for the first time didnt seem capable of direct look
And then after he had built himself up to almost cer tainty of Pals safety By God Dean
Maybe should start police drive have every cop in the city looking for Johnny Fitzpatrick You said yourself Vee theyd kill her then
Theyd have to to protect them selves But he couldntnot the head of the Murder Syndicate
Hes too busy today must be
Andand He sat down in chair put his head in his hands
Fitz patrickthe others who hold her for him
Theyd shoot her to death strangle her maybe just chloroform her
Dont you see Dean
Dont you understand
dont want her to dielike Stacey walked over to him and put hand on his shoulder
Dime Detective Magazine He jumped to his feet said No word yet from the postal authorities nothing about the letter There couldnt be Vee
Its scarcely noon God He thumped hand to his head
Ill get them Dean
The Murder Syndicate Fitzpatrick anyone who had the least hand in it
Ill devote my life to it
Ill kill each one of them slowly hor ribly He turned on me
Im talking like maniac and you let me rave
Am the Crime Machine that all crooks fear
Well he doesnt fear me
He takes Pal and laughs at me He does fear you Vee
Cant you see that
Thats why he took Palto throw you make you useless when youre most needed
Yes said when he just stared at me
Youll lose your head and Pal will pay for it
Stop He jumped to his feet glared at me
When he spoke again his voice was very calm
Youre right of course
Dead right
Youll have nothing further to complain aboutnor the peo ple servenor Pal He turned and left me going straight to the gunroom
The soundproof doors closed but knew that he was working the thing out of him
That each dull crack of his gun sent mental bullet into the body of the Murder Syndicate
We never left the apartment
Vee had dinner with me
He didnt talk didnt need to
His face was hard and cold his lips tight his eyes burning balls far back in his head
didnt talk either
FTER dinner Brown went out on the terrace and stood looking over the city
It was raw mean misty rain in the air
brought him out his coat
He didnt speak just nodded his head as he threw it over his shoulders
The phone rang as went in
It might be the call Brown was expecting hoping for
lifted the receiverand froze
The voice was the same
It was the head of the Murder Syndicate
He spoke quickly
Vee Brown
You disobeyed orders and went out
Gertrude la Palatin is dead
They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Run out to Staten Island then
Goodbye The phone clicked
looked at the clock
It was exactly fourteen minutes after eight
Should tell Vee
Should IAnd looked at something else
At the figure that stood in the open French doors the coat half around his shoulders his hair matted down on his forehead his black eyes blazing
Well who was it
The postal And moving forward It was the Murder Syndicate He said started then couldnt give him the message
Yes His voice was very low
The same thing Vee
That you couldnt stop him from making good tonight and And PalPal His eyes were fev erishly brightpoints of heated steel in the center
Shes dead
ShesHes done Dean Shes dead said
Then told him gave him the message
had to
There was no excitement after that
He seemed very calm
The government has failed me
The Murder Syndicate has beaten me
Ill have to go out to Staten Island
Theres chance just possible chance thatMy God
She may still be living
Ill get the police out there and Wong said as he followed strange man into the room Brought him through servants entrance as you make sugges tion Mr Vee
Thishe is the right one And from the position of Wongs right hand beneath his white coat knew it would go rather badly whh the stranger if he were not
Ive got thethe document The man hesitated looked at me
Red Friday Youll have to go it alone Brown spoke quickly far back in his throat You can talk to Dean here andyes let me see it This as Wong left
Brown took the already opened letter from the mans hand
The government man was surprised
Youre not going with me thought you wanted to Whats the matter Shes alive Dean Vee cried out as he thrust the letter into my hand
You were right
Hes afraid of me wanted me out of things for tonight far outon Staten Island
Here Let me read it again all of it He snatched the letter
Later got look at it
It was much the same as the others
rather long explanation of how Brentwood must pay the twentyfive thousand which didnt read then and dont consider of much im portance now
But the thing that got me and got Brown was the last of it brutally facetious
There is to be an added attraction to tonights little performance
Besides Alli son Brackenbridge we are also adding the famous actress Gertrude la Palatin to our list The usual courtesy shown the gentler sex will be missing on this occasion
She will meet death directly after the body of Allison Brackenbridge is found
Miss la Palatin has been under the per sonal protection of Detective Vee Brown
The same Vee Brown who announced through the papers that he would take me tonight Friday the Thirteenth
Miss la Palatin will be nailed upa living picture of this detectives conceitand in retalia tion for his former attack on me
TEE BROWN different man now alert eager anxiouswas speaking
His words jumped out
Miss la Palatins life depends on our action tonight He turned to the stranger
We are fortun ate Halley that in this letter the Murder Syndicate does not name the place where the body is to be found
You know this Brackenbridge Dean Only that hes vicepresident of the Third National Bank and Trust Com pany that he has money andI think was divorced and married again The government man Halley said to Vee Ive got orders that its your show Mr Brown
But put smart man on this Brackenbridge
Hell get information at least all thats necessary
Ill just use this phone He did and it was surprising the infor mation his man had obtained in that short time
Halley read it from the telephone notes he had made
Age fiftytwo
This is his second wife
Divorced the firstover woman not the one he married
Has two chil dren by his first wifeboth married
One child by He seemed to skip down the pad
got his address of course
And hes partial to women
Thats well known understand
Hes been blackmailed once or twiceor at least shaken down
But outside of that clubman extremely wealthy dignified and important
The man the big boys have to see when they want to borrow money from the bank Everything but who he voted for at the last election could get that too guess Halley grinned
Now what Since we dont know where hes to be killed or how hes to be lured there wed better go straight to his house and size him up see if hes got the guts to play ball Lets get going Halley agreed
Just one thing more Vee clutched his arm
This is more than plain business with me Halley He tapped the letter
Miss la Palatin
This murderer has her prisoner
It may be hard to force him to tell us where she is
want the oppor tunity to do that before the police come Halley ran hand through his hair looked down at Brown
Its irregular of course
But if were searching the place for clues couldnt be expected to watch you nor the man either Dime Detective Magazine Both men looked at each otherblack eyes and gray ones locked
They didnt speak
After half minute perhaps then hands met
YJFE went out into the drizzle and to the house of Allison Brackenbridge
Well make it Dean Brown told me over and over
Our murderer always runs true to form
As we mounted the stone steps Brown said Now to frighten ten years from mans life He slid quickly into the vestibule and waited for the door to open
The butler was stiff oversized piece of wax work
He raised his eyebrows as if he had seen it done that way in the movies when the three of us pushed our way into the hall
Then he spoke far down in his chest
Brackenbridge is out And to Vee Brown who had said that Brackenbridge was expecting us He certainly must have entirely forgotten the appointment
Hes out every Friday night
Club you know
Practically his only recreation from business
What dub Brown demanded
Im sure wouldnt know that
And if did know it couldnt take the liberty to Who is at home None of the family
At this time of the year they spend their weekends at Damn their weekends And catch ing himself up Its extremely important that we get in touch with Mr Bracken bridgeimportant to him The butler hesitated long time looked us over finally said His secretary Mr Collins happens to be here
Ill tell him if youll give me your names Halley stepped forward but Brown motioned him back shook his head
Never mind the names
Get Mr Collins at once The butler nodded turned slowly about and with measured tread crossed the hall to door at the rear and at the extreme right
Come on Brown motioned to us to follow and to Halley He doesnt lode as if hed talk but dont want him to know were the law Mr Collins stood behind long flat desk with multitude of papers before him
He was very tall and very thin and his shoulders bent forward
His age was perhaps forty
Brown said without preliminaries How long have you been with Mr Brackenbridge Eleven years
The man leaned over the desk his eyebrows raised some what like the butlers
Your question sir might be considered an impertinence and Hell said Brown
Wheres Brack enbridge He snapped out badge pointed at Halley
Hes secretservice man
Ever hear of the Murder Syndi cate Yes
Yes have Then dont monkey around
Weve come here to save Mr Brackenbridges life
Hes the next victimtonights vic tim
Now where is he THE mans face turned sort of green ish yellow his arms seemed to fold up on the desk
He just slid rather than fell into the chair
Not Mr Bracken bridge
It couldnt be Where is he Brown demanded
Hes at his dub
cancan get hold of him there on the phone and tell him Collins reached for the phone
Brown never took his eyes off the man his hand shot oifl shoyed Collins back
Give me the name of the dub
Ill get him Its not exactly club
Itsits Its dame eh Brown nodded and to Halley Of course thats it The Mur der Syndicate discovered he visited woman
From what the butler said its Red Friday every Friday night
Or maybe this time for the weekend Collins tongue came out ran over his lips
He sputtered The scandali Why not let me telephone him and warn him And suddenly My God gentlemen this is terrible
dont know what to do what to say
Hes Just young lady he has grown interested in as if she were his own daughter
His own children being married and Her name
Her address
Is he there now Brown slammed out the words
Miss Claire Vaugne Collins gave us an address further uptown
You think this devil knew about thethe young lady
Why its ghastly
Mr Bracken bridge will be there alone with her alone in that big house No servants No Collins was excited now and didnt choose his words
He forgot that Mr Brackenbridges interest was simply fatherly
No servants on Friday nights
Mr Brackenbridge had anunpleasant ex perience before
Hes careful man
Now Brown was questioning the thor oughly frightened secretary
What type of man was Brackenbridge
Would he play along with them
Would he help set die trap that would catch the Murder Syndicate
Good God Collins gasped
Have Mr Brackenbridge stay there and wait for the murderer to come
The scandal of the thing You think hed rather be nailed to wall eh
No no Collins began to run hands through his hair sort of dance up and down
must call him
He mustnt stay there another minute
dont see how the house was discovered
said Its private house Vee
We might get in hide somewhere and No no He shook his head
That wouldnt do
It depends too much on luck
The stage has to be set
Bracken bridge has to be the featured player TTALLEY said slowly We know where he is and know its love nest
We can walk in catch them togeth er and give Brackenbridge his choice of playing along with the law or facing scandal And the woman Women can be bandied too Gentlemengentlemen The secre tary was ready to blow up
Brack enbridge is big man powerful man has influence
You cant take liberties with him as you would with Halley jerked thumb at the secretary Collins
What about this bird
Hell buzz Brackenbridge as soon as we leave Brown lifted the phone called num ber
heard him talking to Finn big rough excop who now served on the As staff
Thats right he was finishing
You know Dean Condon
Hell meet you right up from the corner with this party
No youre not to do thing to this man just ride him around
Yes you can take him out to the roadhousesanything at all
But dont let him get near phone
You can spend century Brown looked at Collins
Youll need it
He doesnt look like heavy spender We had little trouble of course
You cant do this and You cant do that from Collins
Then he heard Browns name
He fairly gasped
Not the detective who shot all those men andand Big Boy Wallace Thats right Brown twisted his mouth slightly
So you make squawk on the way out and Ill put bullet or two in your back His voice sounded very serious almost solemn yet he wink ed at Halley when Collins turned
We left without even the butler bring aware of our departure
Dime Detective Magazine We had walked down the block and Brown had hailed cab before Collins found his voice
assure you Mr Brown wont mention word of this to anyone wont even telephone Mr Brackenbridge
So you see theres no needreally no need at allof treating me like common felon Its for your own good Brown slapped him on the back as he pushed him into the cab
Look at the story you can tell him if Brackenbridge asks why you didnt phone And to me All right
You deliver him safely to Finn
Halley and cant spare the time But want to must be there And you will
You know the address
Wait around the corner down the block Ill come for you And we were off
No need to go into Collins conversa tion or my anxiety to get him off my hands
We met Finn huge giant of man whose capacity certainly was not all muscular
So you and me are going to make night of it eh Finn took Collins arm as he led him to another car
It wont cost us cent so well drink only the best But neverthat is seldom touch anything Oh no heard Finn say just before returned to my own cab
But you will tonight Mr Collins
You will tonight CHAPTER NINE Behind the Curtains TVHEN reached the comer uptown dismissed the car and waited
Five ten minutes passed nearlfifteen
Had things gone wrong had things broken without me
But it was early yet very early for And jumped
Brown had crossed from the other side of the street and tapped me on the shoulder
We make our entrance from the street behind he told me
Really no need for it
Dean for Im sure the house isnt watchedthat is unless this Murder Syndicate has hired place across the street and watches from the window
Still well stick to that rear entrance He led me down the street and around the corner still talking
And theres no need for him to have the house watched
Its just natural for our murder master
Hes discovered Brackenbridges littleor rather large love nestfor the house is fourstory one
There is no one there but the squeakyvoiced blonde and our eminent banker
Its setup oneman job
By God Dean he could murder both of them and take his time about it
dont think he even thought the secretary was on His shoulders moved as he looked up at house and we ducked quickly into an alley
We cant afford to be seen by the peo ple in the house behind and have the police on us Brown said as we sought particularly dark corner and climbing the fence dropped to the stone yard of the place we sought
Vee asked him what did Brack enbridge say
Hethe girl
They let you in
Was he willing to help the police by waiting and Not so fast Dean
In the first place we werent let in
We came by cellar window He chuckled slightly
He had been feeling and acting himself once more ever since the letter with the news Pal was alive
We entered at most embarrassing moment for Mr Bracken bridge
most compromising situation to put it mildly
Damn it
Dean he thought we were detectives looking for divorce evidence and tried to buy usoff
He was almost relieved when he found we only wanted to prevent his murder Would he help Red Friday He will could see Browns head nod as we reached the back door
When he got thinking and recalling what he had heard about this killer he agreed
His enthusiasm was not great
Ill admit
But you can have look at him yourself
Ive set the stage Brown locked the back door carefully behind him
We passed through the kit chen pantry dining room and so to the living roomand Allison Brackenbridge
He was banker
He couldnt have been more of banker if he had been made up to play the part
Cold steady eyes an extra chin slightly bald and skin as pink and white as babys
And the blond doll
She was just thata blond doll
She kept powdering her face fixing her lips and muttering My Godmy God This is terrible But she cast furtive questioning spec ulative blue eyes at the banker
She was wonderingwas this the end of the sugar
Should she make scene blame him put on an act
But she wasnt sure wasnt going to make any mistake and kept to the safety of My Godmy God
This is terrible TTALLEY said Mr
Brackenbridge is beginning to weaken
hope he does nt mess things up For his own sake hope he doesnt Brown was very grave
Certainly theyd spread his name all over the papers
Hell have to stick it out anyway and if he wont play our game then And turn ing to the banker You know the papers Mr Brackenbridge
Murder Monster Trapped in Bankers Love Nest
Allison Brackenbridge Stop it
Stop it Brackenbridge toyed with the thick black ribbon that dropped down from his glasses
How will my actions prevent such scandal For one thing said Brown Im willing to go to bat for you
You received threats from the Murder Syndicate But never got so much as line had no idea of such thing know
But this is your story now
You didnt wish to alarm your family so said nothing to them but came straight to me
You have been acting under my advice ever since
You say Collins rented this place
Very well the papers cant do much about that
Youve already used the phone and tried to get Collins the butler knows that
It was rather important
Then Collins called you at your club at least you thought it was Collins
He had to see you at once he seemed excited
You came here to his house
Youve met him here beforethings to do with the banktimes you must not be disturbed
And there you are
gun in your back andwith wave of his hand toward Halley and myselfthe rescue squad But it doesnt sound convincing
The papers Collins is not important to the papers and the papers wont take chance on libel suit Yes the girl cut in
What about memy reputation You said Brown will leave im mediately after thethe end of the Mur der Syndicate
You wont be questioned wont even be in it
Ill see to that And after thatwhat She half jerked her head toward the banker
After thatBrown smiled at her imagine penthouse over on Park Avenue
Im sure its more sensibleand safer
There is no reason why things should change between you and Mr Brackenbridge
Of course hell be rather pleased and thankful that youre helping too helping him as well as the police
daresay his reward will be more than generous
He was saying what little wonder you are Oh Ally The girl walked over Dime Detective Magazine curled an arm around the bankers neck
You didnt meannot the ring looked atnot the one from Cartiers
Of course Ill do it for you Yes yes Allison Brackenbridge stretched up his hand and patted the back of hers as if he were tapping desk at board meeting
was thinking some thing like that
But the house should be surrounded by police the man could be arrested before he even got up the steps We went over all that Brown shook his head
We want to be certain
Be sides with the place surroundedso many men men who might talk to the papers about you and Miss Vaugne
But brought in Mr Condon
Best shot in the city Maybe reddened dont know
Brown always kidded me about my shoot ing
But Allison Brackenbridge came to his feet and shook hands with me
So thats settled Brown seemed very confident very sure
Well go through it again then take our places
We cant tell when or how hell come And stage director getting ready to shoot his picture was never more partic ular than Vee
The stage was set
tTHE girl and the banker were to stay alone in the large living room both window shades tightly drawn
There was small door that led to the main hall folding doors with huge heavy drapes that led to the dining room
These doors were open but the curtains tightly drawn
Then there was another set of folding doors that gave onto the front room that overlooked the street These also sported two heavy curtains which Brown drew tightly
There we are Brown explained the whole situation and seemed satisfied
If the trap was natural for this murderer our trap for him is natural too
dont know how hell come but Ive locked the door of the front room which leads to the hall so he wont disturb us
Thats right
Deanwe three will be hiding behind the curtains in the front room
That makes Mr Brackenbridge perfectly safe But suppose Mr Brackenbridge in terrupted he should not come alone
What then Hes got to come alone
Now Mr Brackenbridge you and Miss Vaugne must spend your evening as you would ordinarily spend it
Since Id like you at the table with your back to the curtains so that the man must face usperhaps you might be doing little writing
Miss Vaugne will sit there by the diningroom curtains and read under the lamp Halley said Dont you think little conversation might be better Brown hesitated shook his head
The Murder Syndicate wont know how long theyve been just like that
He cant look in the window
You see he may come right to the front door and ring the bell he may enter by the cellar window as we did
He may even have been here before and had key made
YesI know
Light conversation would be bet ter Halleymuch more natural perhaps
But its too much to ask of them
If our man listened and heard hed find the un natural strained theatrical note in it and be suspicious
No dont think either one of them could put that over Brown took one more look about the room
Brack enbridge sat behind the flat desk
Miss Vaugne dropped rather awkwardly into the chair beneath the lamp and opened book
All right Vee nodded
Now well leave you and watch from behind the curtains looked down at my watch
It was exactly twenty minutes of ten when we pushed the curtains aside and stepped be Red Friday hind them
saw both Halley and Vee reach for their guns and saw Brown grin as clumsily pulled mine from my pocket
Halley took up position right in the center where the curtains parted
Brown hesitated raised hand as if to tap Hal ley on the shoulder then changing his mind went to the end nearer the door that led to the hall
He motioned to me to take the other end
So we were set
Three men
Two of them steady cool used to danger and meeting that danger quickly and with the assurance of long experience
The third man
grinned to myself
Well Id been with Brown and certainly was used to danger even if couldnt meet it with much assurance
THROUGH the comer of that curtain peered into the room
Stiff and straight Allison Brackenbridge sat be hind the desk
Over his shoulder was the mantelpiece
On it was modern electric clock
Occasionally the girl moved the book in her lap crossed her legs kicked one leg against the curtains leading to the dining room
Once when that curtain swayed from her moving foot she jarred up with start put her hand to her mouth sat so on the edge of the chairthen with queer little giggle fell back in the chair
Brackenbridge didnt speak either
He bent over the paper before him making queer designs on it think
But his eyes were ever raising gluing themselves upon the curtains as if he would stare right through their thickness and assure him self that we were still there
Several times straightened Id get sort of stiff
Ten oclock came
Ten min utes after ten
was staring into that roomjust staring and thinking
They were not pleasant thoughts
We were waiting for killer againa monster of murder
The picture was vivid in my head
Staten Islandthe man on the wall
And jarred back
My gun nearly went off
The voice sounded like gigantic roar in the utter stillness of my own horrible thoughts
Allison Brackenbridge had sud denly burst out with Listen Mr Brown
Suppose he starts shooting
He wont Brown snapped out from behind the curtains
Be man Brack enbridge And for the first time no ticed the pallor of the bankers face
Its my family not myself Im think ing of
If anything should happen to me you know
Then the bank
They depend on me for most Silence Brown snapped
And as Brackenbridge opened his mouth as if to speak again Or scandal Brackenbridges lips went tight
He glared at the curtains moment
Then worried look took the place of the glare
He smiled and nodded
It was as if he suddenly realized that his life depended on Brown on us behind the curtains
The silence again
The girl with the book the pages of which she never turned Brackenbridges scratching scrawl upon the paperand the single distant chime of clock
That must be in the hall thought
Halley was still bent in the same posi tion looking between the curtains
Brown was crouched low squatted on his haunches half sitting on his heels
went back to my thoughts again
Twice jerked up my head with start
Things had seemed to get so far away
Brackenbridge seemed blurred indistinct like three men sitting there
rubbed my hand across my eyes smothered yawn and bent forward gluing my eyes to the tiny slit
looked at the girl and the curtains beside her the curtains that led to the dining room
The curtains moved swayed Dime Detective Magazine as they had swayed before swayed as they had swayed when the girl had crossed her legs swayed stiffened froze
The girl had not moved had not crossed her legs
Andand God in heaven
had to hold my breath to keep from crying out
The curtains were part ing
figurea figure that made no soundthat gave no warningwas com ing into the room
The Murder Syndi cate was there in the house with us
There in the room
CHAPTER TEN The Man in the Mask PALL broad all in black
Black hat long black mask covering his face as he stepped between those curtains
The girl raised her eyes leaped to her feet opened her mouthand the mans hand went up and down
There was thudblood on her forehead
saw the red plainly before she sank to the floor
raised my gun shoved the end of it close to the crack then felt hand touch my arm
nearly screamed but didnt
It was Halley
He had squeezed my arm in warning guess
The Murder Syndicate was there
saw the gun in his right hand folded length of heavy cloth in his leftcloth that was the shape and bulk of tool kit from motor car
The masked figure moved quickly so quickly that Brackenbridge had not turned his head before the man had crossed the room and stood beside the desk half facing us half facing Brack enbridge who had swung around
The bankers breath just whistled in his throat
Both his hands grasped the arms of his chair
Allison Brackenbridge The man spoke slowly distinctly and certainly ominously
You who once refused me money will be the example that will make many men pay mepay me when they see you nailed like bat to the wall of this room long pauseand that voice that seemed to ring with disaster
Allison Brackenbridge am the Murder Syndi cate
have come for you The monsters left hand came up above the flat desk jerked forward in sharp sudden motion that was arrested in mid air
saw the bag in the left hand un wind stretch out
heard the rattle of metal upon the desk
Then saw what was there
great quantity of huge spikelike nails and hammer lay on the desk before the bulging eyes of Allison Brackenbridge
The bankers head twisted as if unseen hands moved it
His eyes lowered and he saw the woman unconscious upon the floor
His head swung slowly back and he faced the masked man
Then he looked on the desk again and think for the first time realized what the nails and the hammer meant for he just screamed out the words
For Gods sake
YouBrown He half rose in his chair and pointed straight at the curtains where we crouched
The masked figure moved his gun slightly in his right hand and fired
One shot or two
wasnt sure then
It seemed like single shot yet too loud for just one
Halley beside me jarred back swayed raised his hands and gripped at the cur tains
But just before he fell to the floor dragging the curtains with him knew that two shots had been fired and that Brown had shot the murder monster right in the stomach
Chaos after that
No dont think so
saw the masked man raise his left hand stagger slightly and clutch at his stomach
Then the falling curtains were Red Friday upon my shoulders across my arm over my gun
But could see and what saw didnt help me any
The murderer raised his right hand
Glassy blinking balls glared at me through slits in the mask
He washe was God
He was going to kill me
Another shot came
Orange blue flashed to my right burnt powder was in my nostrils
The murderer jerked back his right arm went into the air his gun ex ploded
bullet tore into the ceiling and now he clutched at his stomach with both hands as he staggered wildly blindly about the room
TT ALLEY lay on the floor
could see the back of his head his right hand stretched out his gun still gripped in it
And saw Brown the curtains hadnt caught him
He was too quick too clever for that
Now he was in the living room talking to the staggering figure
You dont like it eh
Dont like it in the stomach
WellI didnt think you would
Wheres Gertrude la Palatin The staggering figure turned faced Vee bent his head forward peered straight at Brown but didnt seem to see Wheres Gertrude la Palatin Brown asked again
His voice was harder now coldermerciless
The voice of killer
The masked figure whirled in circle to come back facing Vee again
He cried out Youll never see her
Shes dead
Yes shes dead
had premonition to night and telephoned Johnny Fitzpatrick to kill her
Ahl He jerked up his right handfired
And Brown shot him in the center of his chest
knew that for the man clawed at his chest now tore at the vest the shirt beneath it screamed horribly as he crashed bade against the wall
He didnt fall at once
He stood there trying to push himself erect as his knees gave
But he couldnt make it
He sank to his knees toppled forward hung so moment and rolled over on his back
And all the time Halley and the girl lay on the floor and Brackenbridge sat in the chair
He hadnt fainted for his eyes were open just staring glaring blank ness in them
The murder monster groaned and once he screamed in agony God
It hurts it hurts
II Kill me
Kill me He raised his gun as Brown crossed the room
Look out Vee cried but didnt need to
The man couldnt see Brown now or if he could he didnt want to didnt care
He was twisting his gun to ward his own head
Brown kicked the gun from his hand sent it across the room said Wheres Gertrude la Palatin Shes dead
told you shes dead And from pleading to be killed he sud denly cursed
Johnny Fitzpatrick killed herkilled hercut her throat
sent him word
Im glad shes dead
Iwhy dont you kill me Im not going to kill you Brown said
Men die slowly from bullets in the stomachvery slowly and very hor ribly
Wheres Fitzpatrick Brown was standing directly over the other now looking down at the agonized eyes visible through the slits in the mask
Crucifier of Men Vee spoke again and his voice shook slightly wheres Johnny Fitzpatrick Find him Brown said very slowly All right
Heres another
Right in the stomach
Right His gun moved slightly direct ly above that grovelling thing
You cant grabbed at his arm
And he struck me
He turned quickly jerked up his gun and caught me flush on the chin with it
staggered back things Dime Detective Magazine blurred
My knees began to give
But stayed upon my feet
Someone had me by the arms we staggered against the wall together
It was Halley
ST then the man on the floor spoke
Johnny Fitzpatrick killed her and hes waiting for me atI didnt hear the address but did hear the apartment numberFourD Halley said His bullet creased me guess and knocked me cold He ran hand across his head
see Brown got himand the girl is sitting up
What the hell happened to you
Were you hit No no
Things just whirled on me Sure said the government man
know how you feel He walked over and looked at the man on the floor
He was still conscious still moaning
Lets have look at that face of his He dropped to one knee grabbed at the mask and tore it off
Agonized features showed
twisted contorted mouth glaring terrible eyes
Eyes with film over them eyes that might have been blue and certainly were fishlike
Eyes that And bent closer then jerked back
Good God cried
Its Teddy Mel rose YesMelrose The man on the floor gasped out the words
They took my money from me
wanted it back
knew Brackenbridge when had money
He sold me out for note
lousy fifty thousand dollars when was worth mil lions
Millions tell you
wanted them again
II He paused looked at Brown
But shes deadshes dead
At least have vengeance Claire Vaugne was on her feet Brack enbridge was muttering something to himself
Brown was at the telephone
heard him talking to Mortimer Doran
dont know what he said but he turned to Halley
Ive got to go Halley
Theres good fellow
Stay and see the police
Its woman Halleya woman loved
Shes dead and You understand Maybe Halley didnt but he nodded as he knelt by Teddy Melrose
You dont have to report to me Halley said to Vee
You can tell your own story
For crack shot you certainly shot this man to pieces Brown smiled sadly
You think hell live Live Halleys laugh was not meant to be funny
Whyyou blasted every thing out of him
Better get going if you dont want to meet the cops Yes Vee turned to the girl
Come along sister
You did your stuff He half led her from the room
VE were out of the house and well down the block before spoke
Do you want me to run ahead for cab No
said Brown
Johnny Fitzpat rick will be there if Melrose telephoned him
Hell be waiting for the payoff
telephoned Wong earlier hell have the car around this corner
Brown was very calm very quiet as he gave orders to drive the young lady to our apartment and get her in the back way
Dont you worry Claire he told her
Well see that youre paid for that crack on the head
Ill be back to ar range hotel for you until things straighten out But my clothes
forgot themev erything is at that house Collins will attend to that and be well paid for it too
You wouldnt think to look at him that there was romance in his heart Vee smiledthat little twisted smile
It was as if he didnt realize that Pal was dead
Then he turned to me
Are you going with Miss Vaugne or with me Vee turned to him
Will you wantI want to go with you Red Friday He held my arm as the car drove away looked up and down the street
too saw the distant lights of taxi
You know what Im going to do and you want to come with me he asked
What are you going to do put it as question but knew
Im going to kill Johnny Fitzpatrick gulped nodded
All right Veeif you must
wont interfere but Im going with you In the cab he said Pal is dead and the man who murdered her still lives
Even you Dean cant think thats right
Im just killer tonight Vee
Vee had hard work talking
You cant just go to murder
Tonight God
You were really going to shoot Melrose dying there on his back He looked straight at me
caught his flashing black eyes in the glare from the street lights
dont know
Hon estly dont know
But you thought so And suddenly So it was Teddy Mel rose eh
He wanted money
He hated people
And he was right
There has to be first time No wonder he knew everything the police did being so close to Inspector Ramsey was trying to make conversa tion
minute later said You Vee
Did you suspect Melrose To you No
Not in the slightest
To the papers Well wont lie to themthat is not directlybut Ill smile rather knowingly
You can let us out here driver And that last almost casual order sent my heart right into my throat
was going with Vee to kill man
had never seen Brown more quiet more sure of himself
He explained that as we reached the entrance of the walk up apartment found the outside door open and slipped inside
Shes dead Dean
cant alter that
If she were alive might go dashing up those stairs toto my death
But theres no hurry now
Afterward suppose it will get me but nowhe found the bell he sought and pressed his finger against itJohnny Fitzpatrick will be waiting expecting the Murder Syndicate SPHERE was steady click of the snap ping lock on the door
Brown reached out pushed the door open
We stepped into the dimly lit hall
Vee closed the door slowly and carefully behind him and turned toward the stairs
What are you going to do Veeex actly He looked at me long moment there at the foot of the stairs
am going to shoot him to deathexactly His whole attitude was free from any nervous ex citement
You surely wouldnt have it any other way
It cant be called anything but weakness anything but vengeance
But couldnt have him live
Afterward Afterward He said simply will never write music again
Oh thats not the rambling of broken heart not even sacrifice to ambition
Its just fact
Somehow know it And suddenly in hard even voice Come on
You will deaden your feet so it will sound like one manthe one man hes expecting Without another word followed him up the stairs
As we turned on the second flight Brown whispered over his shoulder Well lighted
Well be able to see each other if he comes out into the hall
Itll be an even break there Dean And he laughed
At least there was queer sound down in his throat
was close on his heels when we reached the fourth floor never slowing up in our steady pace never pausing to listenjust going up
We turned suddenly stopped dead
We Dime Detective Magazine were directly before the door the open door of apartment Johnny Fitzpat rick stood framed there in the light
His right hand was at his side and his right hand held heavy revolver
Brown said Raise it if you want to Fitzpatrick
Get inside And as pressed behind Vee and followed Fitz patrick who backed into die apartment
Brown went on Dont drop it Fitz dont drop the gun
That wont save you now
If you want it to be plain murder dont mind The door sprang closed behind us
We were in small living room
Johnny Fitzpatrick was finelooking man well over forty guess graying slightly at the temples
His sharp eyes were gray and held sort of perpetual humor in them
Yes they held it even nowpuzzled perhaps but certainly without fear
What are you doing here
Brown he asked and his voice didnt tremble
Firm hard lips snapped closed after he spokenothing else
Im going to shoot you to ribbons Johnny Browns eyes narrowed his right hand came up
Thats why didnt just IdH you in the hall
Now woman shrieked
small figure dashed from the bedroom was across the room almost in Vees arms before knew the truth spotted the red head that pounded itself against his chest Yes it was Gertrude la PalatinPalalive and welL GTHE explanation came then
Johnny Fitzpatrick stuck cigar in his mouth while he talked
Of course he said thought it was you and not Ramsey or Teddy Melrose who stuck Pal on me
But knew from the beginning it was plant
Ive been out of the city but keep myself informed
guess it hurt me
Brownhurt my pridethat you and the little lady connected me up with the Murder Syndicate
And wanted to get himnot entirely for the money but you see Im getting on now and the past well at night it has habit of going to bed with me
Pal knows all about that
Believe it or not felt like squaring my self with myselfand getting the Mur der Syndicate would do that
So laid my own trap
talked all over my month along the Avenue argued that the head of the Murder Syndicate was great guy and knew his business that could use money and if the boys of today didnt have the stomach for his racketwhy did
Of course never suspected Melrose
And the Murder Syndicate fell for my little monologue got me on the phone and offered me five grand to snatch Pal
played him along took Pal into my confidence on the prom ise she wouldnt squawk to you and worked the snatch But why
Because hed trust me come here for her
And Id put the finger on him
It would have worked too guess
Yes to night he rang me up told me to give her the works leave the body in the apart ment and hed take care of it later Fitz patrick nodded grimly
Id have been here when he came Brown grinned shoved out his hand
Maybe its just as well Johnny that didnt shoot you to death
But theres no reward for you
Ive planned to send that money to Staceys wife in Illinois His lips ourved into that little crooked smile
Itll buy her better husband
He stopped started to hum looked at Pal
Theres song there kida real one
It goes like thisIll buy me better husband Ill purchase another man Chuck Evans and Joe Getts were just couple of smart guystwo of kindwho happened to get caught up in the same brain storm
But when the shooting and shouting died it didnt take either one long to see that smarty vs smarty can end in draw as well as win and blast hell out of anybodys AUTOMATIC ALIBI by Carl Clausen He looked up as the door creaked and reached for his gun
HUCK EVANS was smoking his aftersupper cigarette by the gas log and looking at Flossie his wife through hole in the newspaper which he was ostensibly reading
He had fallen into the habit of observing her surrepti tiously of late in detached sort of fash ion as if she were specimen presented to him for classification
Once upon time Mr Evans had loved her in the possessive way in which men cherish things hard won
Like his other Dime Detective Magazine fitting answer rose to his lips but extralegal activities she represented definite quantity of effort He had taken her from another by the right of conquest
The other man was Joe Getts
Chuck scrutinized Flossie through the hole the paper
She was mending run in silk stocking by the light of the bridge lamp
Her lips were too red her hair too platinum
These were the obvious details
They evoked no thought of cen sure
Chuck liked his women vivid
What irked him was the knowledge that the sudden tender curve of her lips as she bent forward at her task was for Joenot him
Mr Evans was not given to selfanaly sis so he merely wondered what good looking broad like Flossie could see in gorilla like Joe Getts and he smiled mys teriously behind the newspaper as he toyed with the idea of what he meant to do to that simian this night Presently he laid the paper down and glanced at his wristwatch
Guess Ftt be going over to the Dutch mans he said
He had made this re mark threesometimes four and occa sionally fivenights week for the past year hut tonight he injected an extra note of casualness in the statement
The Dutchmans was poolroom where men of his kind congreg ate and dis cussed ways and means
The four flea bitten pool tables were an excuse to per mit the police to collect the license fee
In the rear room one could buy anything from hypodermic needle to gat
Wish youd go up to the storage and get my fur coat Flossie said without raising her eyes from the stocking
Its glaced and all ready
The paper says its going to be cold tomorrow You mean that joint way up on Am sterdam and Ninetyfifth he demanded
All right never mind she retorted
There was once youd have run your self ragged for me thought flashing into secret and hid den chamber of his tortuous mind he kept his peace
He consulted his watch again and com pared it with the clock on the mantel
Unknown to Flossie he had set both ahead half an hourfor purposes of his own
Why dont you phone them and tell em to deliver it he asked
Because tonights Saturday night
They wont make deliveries after eight but theyre open till midnight All right he grumbled Ill get it HE went down on die automatic ele vator Chuck Evans smiled to him self
Amsterdam and Ninetyfifth was way uptown far from where he meant to be earlier in the evening
It would provide him with an additional link in the cleverly constructed chain which was to be his alibi for die evening
Mr Evans never depended upon friends for his alibis
He was essentially the lone wolf type and never delivered him self into the hands of another friend or enemy
His alibi was more subtle one
The man he intended actually to rub out was not Joe Getts but anotherone Man uel Cortez
The setup was as follows Mr Getts had recently essayed to terminate the ex istence of Mr Cortez by spraying him with lead from cruising cabriolet but the body of Mr Cortez own hack had been reinf arced with bulletproof steel for just such an eventuality so Manuel had merely taken to his bed with slight wound in the thigh
Both Mr Getts and Mr Cortez had sworn to get Mr Cortez and Mr Getts as soon as the former was able to be about again and the florists ajacent to Columbus Circle were placing tentative orders with Jersey nurseries in anticipa tion of the event
Automatic Alibi Per se
Chuck Evans had nothing against Manuel Cortez beyond the fact that he did not belong to that branch of the human race known as Nordic of which Mr Evans himself was conspicu ous member
Mr Cortez had merely sin gled himself out for his special attention by being an enemy of Mr Getts and get ting himself in the way of Joe Getts slugs
It was situation for which Mr Evans had waited in his patient way ever since he had verified his suspicions of Flossie and Joe
Technically there was no reason why Chuck Evans and Joe Getts should be on the outs
Each controled his own definite racket and neither had been known to en croach on the other
Ostensibly they were the best of friends
They had even been known now and then to join forces in discreet warehouse robberies when their respective supplies ran short
Once or twice they had appeared in court with as plausible alibis for each other as the legal machinery required
To the world Chuck Evans and Joe Getts were just couple of guys trying to get along in adjoining neighborhoods by observing the rules of the game
All this made excellent stagesetting for what Mr Evans meant to do which was simply to call on Manuel Cortez after dark and finish what Mr Getts had be gun
The police of course would not sus pect him of so fell purpose since there seemed no reason on earth why he should shoot Mr Cortez
And with his customary attention to detail Mr Evans had laid out the evenings activities
Emerging from the apartment house in which he lived he went directly to the Dutchmans
He found present there among others Joe Getts in person as he had known he would
As it was the un written rule at the Dutchmans to check ones gun at the counter before gaining admission to the room at the rear
Mr Evans surrendered his automatic pistol and laid it on the shelf behind the cash register in the small compartment which carried his name
Next to it in compartment similarly marked lay Mr Getts
Both pistols were standard types of the most recent and popular make thirtyeight cal iber and except for their makers num bers alike as pair of identical twins
But Mr Evans knew that to an expert on ballistics the projectiles that issued from them were under powerful magnifying glass as different as is pea from pearl
Therefore when Mr Evans deposited his gun on the shelf he laid it in Mr Getts compartment and placed Joes where his own should have been
It was one of those little slightsofhand for which Mr Evans was justly famous
In the back room immediately there after cards were produced
Chuck played stud with Mr Getts and satellite win ning in the course of time fortytwo dol lars
GETTS was restless
After an hours playing he arose intimating that the game was too slow for him and that he had business elsewhere
Chuck did not inquire where for he knew very well where Joe was going
He had even arranged that Mr Getts should be there
Joe Getts went to the shelf behind the cash register to get his gun
He was about to do what Mr Evans had done switch weaponswhen in picking up his own from from Mr Evans compartment he noted by slight scratch on the butt of it that it had already been done for him
He glanced over his shoulder at the Dutch man but that worthy was deeply im mersed in copy of Candid Confessions
He also winked at his own image in the flyspecked mirror over the Dutchmans head as he replaced the pistol where he Dime Detective Magazine had fotmd it and jacked tip the one Mr Evans had intended he should
As he went out he hummed gay little tune from gay little movie
Immediately he set about throwing monkey wrench into Mr Evans elaborate machinery
Chuck himself left the Dutchmans almost at once
In the holster under his left armjnt was Joes pistol
With his customary caution he had checked on that little matter with the makers num ber
He too was in pleasant jocular mood
Sauntering down the street to the local cinema house he engaged the bru nette cashier in conversation to impress his presence on her mind
After chatting pleasantly with her for some moments Mr Evans bought ticket went within and dropped into seat near one of the fire exits
He had already seen the picture at matinee that afternoon
Now he stayed just long enough to assure himself that the program had not been changed in any essential detail so that he would be able to discourse upon it intel ligently should such be necessary
Then watching his chance he stepped across the aisle when the ushers head was turned and departed quietly leaving very small piece of wood in the crack of the doornot thick enough to cause draft but sufficient to keep the latch from catching and locking the door
The exit opened on an alley and this in turn led into side street Once in this street Mr Evans worked fast
Diving into the nearest subway he boarded an express train and rode down town
The place where he got off has been sung in jwetry and prose shocking place where yellow men they say do unspeak able things in unspeakable ways
Where the elevated roars along street that has been in turn quiet lovers lane stately turnpike an artery of commerce cruis ing ground of sailors on furlough and courtesans on high heels and the theme of ribald song
It is now but sad place of rescue missions with no one to rescue pawnshops when there is little to pawn secondhand stores cheap coffee houses and cheaper cinemas
Why Manuel Cortez chose to live in tins neighborhood had always been mys tery to Chuck
He was making plenty of money
Himself fastidious to the point of felinity he shuddered at the odors that assailed him
He came to this region rarely and then only to confer with one Maurice Klopfel pawnbroker about the marketing of such trinkets as came his way in the routine of business
Passing Mr Klopfels place of busi ness now in the shadows of the opposite side of the street he glanced hurriedly through the grimy windows
Mr Klopfel was not in sight and the door leading into the little room at the rear was dosed sure sign that he was in conference
That the conferee was Joe Getts Mr Evans had not doubtfor he himsdf had seen to it that Mr Getts got tele phone message from
Mr Klopfel anent certain trifle in the way of diamonds set in platinum which could be had for the proverbial song
Mr Getts hobby was baubles at cantata prices
He distributed them among his feminine friends at ran dom and not always wisely
Mr Evans had not the slightest doubt that the trifle in question bracelet was destinedin Mr Getts imaginationto adorn the slender wrist of his Flossie after he himself had been somewhere in terred
TTE could of course have shot Mr Getts forthwith but aside from the risk of arrest and conviction there were other reasons why this was inexpedient
Mr Getts was popular with his mob also he was power in politics in his neighborhood as Mr Evans was in his
Automatic Alibi In these days of investigations and Tammany disfavor one had to forget per sonal desires and work for the common good
The home of Manuel Cortez was threestory walkup
In its palmy days when the Bouwerie was in the stately turnpike stage it had been the abode of gentry
On the left brownstonebuttress of the stoop reclined headless Nubian lion on the right what was left of its twin
Mr Evans reconnoitered for moment to assure himself that the coast was clear
Then he walked softly through the alley inserted jimmy under the sash of the rear window and presently found him self in kitchen smelling strongly of gar lic fried olive oil and wine
The combination made Mr Evans slightly nauseated
He paused dizzily drew out his flashlight and made his way upstairs guided by an overlying motif of iodoform
The odor led him straight to Mr Cortez sick room
That gentle Latin was sitting up in bed read ing Little Caesar by the light of shaded bridge lamp and chewing bettelnut He looked up as the door creaked and reached for his gun but he was too slow
Two spurts of flame stabbed the semi darkness of the room and he shuffled off his coil with the gentlest little shiver
Mr Evans left forthwith
As he de parted by the kitchen window he dropped Joe Getts pistol in bed of chrysanthe mums that by some miracle grew under it
To have left the weapon in the room with the remains of Mr Cortez would have been too crude
Among the flowers it would appear that the assassin had lost it by accident
As he walked quickly to the nearest subway entrance he drew off the old pair of gloves he had been wearing for the occasion and threw them into the gutter
There would be no fingerprints on the gun except Joes
When he got back to the cinema house he paused peering through the crack of the door of the fire exit until the usher was elsewhere
Then he slipped within and slid into the nearest vacant seat
The whole thing had taken less than threequarters of an hour
He saw the program to the end chat ted with the brunette cashier on his way out then took the West Side subway to the fur store in Amsterdam Avenue near Ninetyfifth Street
Here he presented the check for Flos sies coat and with the garment over his arm prepared to board downtown train as quickly as possible
He was in hostile neighborhood and did not care to tarry there without gun
One Limp Moran lived worked and held sway from Colum bus Circle north and west of Central Park
And Mr Moran insisted upon charging his limp to bullet from Mr Evans trusty gat the result of slight misunderstanding
Just as he was about to descend into the subway at Broadway and Ninetysixth Street Officer Cassidy strolled around the comer swinging his nightstick
He glared at Mr Evans
What you doin up here Mr Evans indicated the coat on his arm and explained the circumstances
And you had to pick cleaner in Limp Morans neighborhood
Cat sweat
If theres any shootin on this beat
Ill do it see
Beat it was just going Mr Evans re torted firmly but not too firmly
Foine an kape goin Cassidy ad monished
It irked Mr Evans to be addressed thus by mere flatfoot but being without con cealed means of support he did just that
An express train pulling in he boarded it hastily and dropped into vacant seat
Dime Detective Magazine It was not often that Mr Evans ex amined his microscopic soul but the un qualified success of the evening plus the lucky break of Cassidys showing up and adding his mite to an alibi already over flowing pot him in mellow mood
Per haps he had neglected Flossie bit of late he thought as he stroked the seal fur
She had gone to bed when he got in so he hung the coat over the back of chair
As he did so the mantel dock struck twdve
He glanced at it with smile of approbation then opened the glass door and set it bade half an hour to the correct time and did the same to his wristwatch
TJREAKFAST the next morning he tried to invest with mildly festive mood
The toast was slightly turned as usual but he made no comment
The coffee was not all that could be desired but he drank it without scowl
Flossie looked at him thoughtfully
Her hard blue eyes narrowed with suspicion
Where was you last night die asked casually
Why said Chuck went to the Dutchmans and to the movies and then uptown for your benny Oh yeah
Well you took helluva long time about it Mr Evans smiled
Aint getting jealous are you he asked jocularly
What of she demanded looking him up and downmostly down
Mr Evans blinked
Whats eating you this morning he wanted to know
Moths she snapped
The morning paper being at that mo ment slipped under the door she went and got it
If there was one thing that infuriated Chuck it was the habit she had of stand ing in the middle of the kitchen munching toast and scanning the front page with out comment when he wanted to see who had been rubbed out during the night But this morning he knew who had been so he merely watched Flossies face
He gleaned nothing from her expression so he concluded that Mr Cortez demise had missed the morning editions
When Flossie finally laid the paper down he saw that his surmise had been right
Nary an agate line of Mr Cortez departure from this vale of tears
Chuck spent the rest of the morning helping Flossie with the dishes and being generally in the way
Her caustic com ments merely evoked the gentlest of smiles
He wanted to be on hand when the news of Joe Getts arrest came along
He was just about to go down to the comer to see if the noon editions had come out when the bell rang
He went to the door and answered it
It was Lieu tenant of Detectives Paul Ames and Cap tain Rice of the Homicide Squad
The chief wants to see you Chuck said Captain Rice
Whome said Chuck
What for Something about fur warehouse over in Jersey Rice said
Somebody cleaned it out last night havent been in Joisey for month said Chuck
Besides dont do business on that side of the river Captain Rice nodded
Thats what told the chief but orders are orders
He wants the frau to come along too What for
What would Flossie know
She never mixes in business know
But the chief said to bring her in
Tell her to put her hat and coat All right have it my way said Chuck
The police auto was waiting downstairs
The four got in Lieutenant Ames at the wheel
He was tall bronzed man
He leaned over the steering wheel like hard riding cowboy as the car weaved through the traffic with the siren screaming
Automatic Alibi WITH Chief of Police ONeill was District Attorney McLaughlin
The As steelgray eyes sized Chuck up from under their bushy brows
Flossie had been left in the outer room
Mr Evans smiled at the two men
Whats this about warehouse job in Joisey Chief he asked
You wouldnt frame me would you
The chief pointed to chair and Chuck sat down
Where were you last night Evans he asked
Whome said Chuckhis favorite retort when gaining time was the essence of the argument
Then he reeled off his evenings activitiesslightly censored with the ease and confidence of one who knows he has perfect alibi
What time did you get home Mr Evans thought quickly
The epi sode with Officer Cassidy called for slight modification of the time element Half past eleven he replied with the dignity of conscious virtue
The chief made note on pad
You are sure that you stayed at the movie as long as you say you did he asked
Sure did
Ask the cashier girl
She saw me go in and come out He offered in addition to give the chief resume of the entire plot including the news reel and the Mickey Mouse comedy
But the chief waved it aside
Let me see your rod Evans he said
dont lug no rod Chiefnot any more What did you do with it Mr Evans considered
This was some what of quandary
If they had found the pistol on Mr Getts it would be no time at all before they traced it to him by the makers number
Honesty seemed the best policy at the moment
sold it to Joe Getts he replied glibly
The chief said nothing for some mo ments but he and the district attorney ex changed glances
He scribbled again on the pad then handed the result over his shoulder to Lieutenant Ames who left the room immediately
McLaughlin drummed the desk with his long bony fingers
Lieutenant Ames returned presently and handed the slip of paper back to his superior
The chief scrutinized it at length then he said Cassidy stated that he ran into you at the subway entrance at Ninetysixth and Broadway at ten min utes past eleven
Check said Mr Evans happily
And live at Eighth Avenue and Fortysecond
It was just half past eleven when walked into my flat Chief of Police ONeill glanced at the slip of paper in his hand
There seems to be mistake Evans he remarked softly
Your wife just stated to Lieutenant Ames that she heard the clock strike twelve when you came in Mr Evans drew his breath in sharply
The idea of tampering with time had been merely to confuse Flossie should she be called to answer questions
He had achieved the effect it seemed
She was in bed
She must have been dreaming he replied less happily
Shes all wetf Maybe she is but if she isnt Fm just wondering why youre lying about the last half hour
It doesnt matter one way or the other Chucks lips parted then came together with click of teeth
Is that why you brought me into ask me fool ques tions he demanded angrily
The chief shook his head
Not ex actly Chuck wondered if someone had seen him in Manuel Cortez neighborhood
Stalling for time he said Whats all this about anyway
Am supposed to Dime Detective Magazine have ferried across to Joisey and done that warehouse joball in half an hour So you admit that there is half an hour you cant account for Like hell do
went straight home like told you You probably did but still it wont do Evans What wont do Chuck demanded feeling premonition of disaster
Whats all this toid degree about Its about Limp Moran Evans
He was found in the areaway of his apart ment house with bullet through his head TITR
EVANS jerked back his head as if he had been struck with black jack
What he exclaimed
Well for cry ing out loud
And you think Id be dumb enough to croak him after having had Cassidy spot me there
Be your age Chief Youd already killed him when you ran into Cassidy Evans
He found Limps body in the areaway just twenty minutes after you had gone
At precisely eleventhirty Youre crazy
told you didnt carry no rod no more You haventsince last night Evans the chief agreed
He opened the drawer of his desk took out an automatic and pushed it across the desk to Mr Evans
Recognize it he asked
Chuck drew back
His face screwed itself into forced smile
How would
All rods of that make and caliber look the same
And Im not having any thanks he added rubbing the tips of his fingers on his knees
We wont need your fingerprints on it Evans the chief said kindly
We checked the number
It was sold to you by Maurice Klopfel in the Bowery What of it
told you sold it to Joe Getts So you did said the chief
He con sulted once more the slip of paper which Lieutenant Ames had brought in
Joe says youre liar
He never bought any gun from you in his life
Hes down stairs
Shall we bring him up Mr Evans was beginning to suspect that all was not well
Still he believed that he saw light in the offing
You took the rod off him didnt you
That checks with my story of selling it to him Unfortunately it doesnt said the chief
Joe Getts lost his in Manuel Cor tez flowerbed on the getaway and one of the city garbage men found this rod yours Evansin garbage can on Co lumbus Avenue around the corner from Limp Morans apartment house If he did Joe Getts put it there him self Mr Evans asserted vehemently
And then he asked innocently What would he be doing at Cortezs The chief smiled
forgot you hadnt heardor had you
Manuel Cortez was also bumped off last night
Joe was in the neighborhood at the time of the killing
Klopfel the pawnbroker stated that he was in his place for the better part of an hour hag gling over the price of diamond brace let
We fixed the approximate time of the killing by Cuban Pete
He had just left Cortez to go over to Mott Street for some betelnuts
When he got back Cortez was dead The chief paused briefly then added Both cases look so fishy that we kept them out of the morning papers
dont think Joe put your rod in the garbage can but you and your lawyer are welcome to that theory
Qever of you to plant the wifes coat in Limps territory for an ex cuse if you were seen there but Im afraid it isnt going to do you much good Automatic Alibi Mr Evans drew deep breath
So youre framing me for croaking Limp Mo ran he snarled
Chief ONeills mild blue eyes hard ened
never framed yegg in my life and you know it Evans he said harshly
If you have better storyan alibi that will hold waterIm here to listen Mr Evans swallowed hard
He had one eminently waterproof
but he reflected sadly it was hopping literally from the fryingpan into the fire
Ill say what have to say to my law yer he snapped
The chief shrugged his shoulders
Have it your way He paused
thought maybe youd be willing to talk turkey Evans
You had the time the opportunity and the motive for killing Lamp Moran
You havent chance What you meantoikey Well the district attorney here is will ing to accept plea of seconddegree mur der to save the state lot of money
Joe Getts has already agreed to take the rap for Manuel Cortez
Both of you are en titled to medals of course but were out of medals at the moment TR
EVANS ran his hand across his eyes to brush away the unpleasant vision that kept persisting there the vi sion of Flossie wife of his bosom plant ing her fur coat in Limp Morans do main and of Mr Getts being small enough to take advantage of hisMr
Evanslittle joke in exchanging guns at the Dutchmans
Chief ONeill was still speaking
Its an open and shut case Evans
We extracted the slug from Moran and our ballistic expert states that it came from your gun
Examination disclosed that the gun had been fired recently
The same holds good for Joes rodonly it had been fired twice so we have double proof there so to speak
It may interest you to know Evans that never in all my years as cop has so complete and satisfactory chain of circumstantial evidence been pieced to gether in so short time and to Lieuten ant Ames here belongs the credit
So perfect are the two cases that if it wasnt that you and Joe were pals Id think youd framed each other He pushed typed sheet across the desk to Mr Evans
Sign on the dotted line please he said affably
The two regarded each other across the glasstopped desk in which many hard guy had seen the reflection of his finish
Something resembling wink in the mild blue eyes of the chief brought the faintest flicker of smile to Mr Evans thin lips
with me he said briefly and reached for the pen
In the Next Issue CARDIGAN COMES BACK in FREDERICK NEBELS TOO HOT TO HANDLE Page after thrillpacked page of the kind of smashing action youve come to watch for and expect whenever that big dick from the Cosmos Agency is scheduled to appear
This time he gets himself mixed up in murder mystery that has all the earmarks of accidental deathand would have gone down as such if the killer hadnt forgotten to put on his asbestos gloves when Cardigan stepped in
DIME DETECTIVE MAGAZINE It will be out for on SEPTEMBER th AUGUST st For Gocf sake get that Death On Delivery One by one those corpsefreighted terror trunks had been burst open the bodys limbs in each case frozen stiff yet the death cause obviously asphyxiation
What was the reason for this mad contradiction of clues
Why Detective Oakley asked himself should even the craziest killer gas man to deaththen chill only the victims arms and legs against decay
door open Brixey urged
An Oke Oakley Story by Frederick Davis Author of Death Lights the Candle etc
CHAPTER ONE Falling Star LAY OAKLEY of Secrets In corporated feeling in festive mood and with his two assistants at his sidethe pert redheaded Miss Charmaine Morris and the aristocratic Archibald Brixeymounted to the deck of the Ocean Casino
The gambling ship lay at anchor more than twelve miles off the Southern Cali fornia shorea bit farther than the arm of the law could spanaffording music Dime Detective Magazine drink beauteous women various games of chance in short all the revelry that Oakley craved
Crossing the after deck where couples were dancing to radioed music between selections from the ships orchestra he observed familiar faces
From Long Beach swift launches had brought movie actresses in shimmering gowns paunchy men who were Hollywood studio execu tives and painfully handsome juveniles
Present also were few local worshipers doing obeisance to the God of Chance and the usual allotment of sightseers from Iowa
It was all very garish play ful and intoxicating
Stick close to Oke Cherry Oakley sighed to Charmaine Morris
see cov etous eyes directed at you already
And lets make haste to lose few hardearned dollars on these crooked games By Jove Brixey remarked gazing upon soft faces and slender figures in the moonlight This is quite delightful The breeze fluttered Japanese lanterns on deck ice tinkled in tall glasses cards flipped chips clattered inside the main salon
Glancing at Charmaine Morris bril liant coiffure as he moved toward the nearest table Oakley remarked confident ly Im playing my chances with the red TTHE roulette wheel was whizzing and two bright eyes were watching the bounding ball when the radio music gave way to the reproduced clang of bell
Through the loud speaker an announcers voice spoke quickly We interrupt to give you news flash ladies and gentle men
The dead body of an unidentified man has just been discovered under pe culiar circumstances on Roosevelt High way at Santa Monica Never mind Oakley observed
We came here to get away from business few minutes ago the radio per sisted an express truck driving north collided with sedan traveling sputh wrecking both vehicles
The violence of the impact threw from the truck an old trunk which burst when it struck the road
The body of dead man fell out of it body clad only in underwear bear ing marks that seem to indicate murder
The hands and feet of the corpse appear to have been frozen yet death was pre sumably caused by asphyxiation Oakley curled his arm through Cherrys and said happily Red wins and Im playing it again The announcer continued The trunk was an old one bearing the initials which had been freshly painted over
The driver of the express truck was se verely injured and has been taken to St Vincents Hospital
Therefore full de tails concerning the accident are not avail able
The police have not identified the corpse but they have revealed that the little finger of the left hand was ampu tated years ago and there is an American flag tattooed on the right forearm
Any one recognizing this description is request ed to get in touch immediately with the chief of police of Santa Monica The corpse Brixey observed aloofly is stranger to me
Red has won again Oke Oke has taken sudden fancy to brunette Archie Cherry remarked and this time no doubt hell play the blackthe fickle soandso Oakley said Nonsense but kept looking across the table at the ravishing brunette
All that beauty cpuld give was hers perfectly modeled face an exquisite fig ure grace of movement and the reflec tion of uncommon intelligence in her lus trous eyes
Because it was Oakleys busi ness to know all Hollywood faces he rec ognized her as Claire Kent an actress Death on Delivery of rapidly mounting popularity whose presence in many Stupendous Produc tions bad eased the eyes of multitudinous worshiping males
She appeared at the moment however distinctly uneasy and alarmed
Turning quickly from the table her satin gown glimmering with the move ment of her lithe body she hurried to ward the forward deck
Pale and anx ious she paused framed alluringly against the darkness outside and glanced swift ly at Oakley
As Cherry Morris touched his arm Oakley murmured Ravishing and terrified Red has come up again Oke so let that be lesson to you said Cherry
Oakley was again intent upon the spin ning roulette ball when exquisite per fume came to him and soft hand touched his arm
Oakley please may see youalone He turned to look into the dreadfilled eyes of Claire Kent
Her red lips were parted her expression one of pleading
Oakley promptly bowed
Of Course
On deck the actress whispered
know youre private detective
Itits of the utmost importance
Charmed said Oakley
The enchanting vision vanished
Oak ley waited impatiently for the wheel to cease whirling as Brixey observed Real ly some chaps get all the breaks and Cherry Morris added dryly Were here to get away from business are we Red clicked up again and Oakley pocketed handful of chips smiled and excused him self
He stepped toward the door stopped groaned and gazed balefully at the bulky man who barred his way
You he said
McClane your presence mars an otherwise pleasant seascape DetectiveLieutenant McClane from Los Angeles headquarters chuckled Hello shamus
We seem to turn up at the same places dont we McClane smiled as Oakley stepped past
But that shouldnt get under your skin
Weve worked together on plenty of cases and You mean Oakley cut in dryly Ive cracked cases for you that had you com pletely stumped and you ought to be grateful
Instead you have childish notion that all private detectivesme in particularare crooks in fancy disguise
At this very moment youre itching to throw me into the cooler All right all right have it your own McClane broke off and Oakley paused as he was stepping out on deck for at that moment shrill frightened scream rang out TT CAME from the lanternlighted gloom forwardquick sharp breath less
It raised heads from the gaming tables gave dancers pause it brought the heelbeats of the ships bouncers pound ing through the moonlight
Then it came second time strangled gasp as Oak ley shifted quickly to the promenade
Somewhere forward dull blows sound ed and cloth ripped
Feet scraped and flashing whiteness near the rail vanished downward swiftly
Quick footfalls raced away through the darkness and from be low came smacking splash
Man overboard Oakley looked down on terrified girls face red lips parted in sputter ing cry hair wetly matted
An inky wave blotted her over
McClane shouldering close bellowed Lower boat
Wasting no time on thoughts of boats Oakley stripped out of his white mess jacket heeled off his shoes
Whiteness was flickering again through the black waves as he swung over the raiL He heard Cherrys voice exclaim breathless Dime Detective Magazine ly Okecareful and straightened into long smooth dive
He bobbed up at once reached for slender hand that was sliding out of sight beneath the surface
His pull upon it brought close to him girls figure
He hooked one arm beneath her chin and with the other grabbed for life pre server that plunked down nearby
Tread ing water he drew the girls arms through it and shouted toward the gallery of faces peering down from the rail
Pull her up To the girl he urged Hang onl Youre all right The light now showed him the glisten ing features of Claire Kent
She choked and clung desperately to the white ring
As the rope lifted her her gown cling ing skintight trailed water
Oakley struck out smoothly toward the accom modation ladder as she was lifted over the rail
The deck was in commotion when he trod wet footprints across it
Cherry Morris eyeing him askance kept at one side of him the amazed Brixey at the other
Through the hubbub of voices that of Claire Kent was audible
II lost my balance
Im all right
PleaseIt was just an accident
Thank you so much
Ifell She tugged around her blanket that was brought by steward tried to laugh
man in uniform was issuing crisp orders direct ing that Miss Kent be escorted to state room
She protested breathlessly that she wanted to be taken ashore at once
As she hurried to the rail she flashed another glance at Oakley with eyes that desperately warned silence
The swift launch sped from the Ocean Casino
The huddled blanketwrapped figure of Claire Kent faded into the moonlight
Oakleys last glimpse was of her glistening white face
He pulled an other blanket around him as voice said Step this way sir
Well take care of you Brixey snapped He can jolly well take care of himself think youre right Archie Oakley affirmed
Ive suddenly lost interest in this boat
It will be simpler to dry out at home He heard chuckle and turned to en counter McClanes tobaccostained grin
Always the hero the detective bit
Always the horses neck Oakley re torted
As dry as you are at this mo ment McClane you should be ashamed of yourself Huh McClane said dully
As the second launch bubbled its way swiftly toward the distant California shore Cherry Morris her red hair fluf fing in the sea wind watched Oakley with wry smile
Archibald Brixey adjusted his monocle and looked bewildered
She said she fell he recalled
But But is it exactly Archie said shiv ering
For some reason the young lady was desperately anxious that no one know the truth
She didnt fallshe was thrown overboard Cherry Morris spoke up pertly
Of course she was thrown Archie
It was Oke who fellfor her CHAPTER TWO The Second Trunk YAKLEY punched the bell of modest house in Beverly Hillsmodest as judged by the grandiose standards of the Hollywood film colony impressive by any other
He gazed at the car which stand ing before the entrance was powdered from bumper to bumper with alkali and dust
He glanced at his watch to see that it was shortly past nine Then watched Charmaine Morris powder her patrician nose before he rang
Strange he observed that we Death on Delivery havent heard from Claire Kent since last night Is it darling Cherry asked frostily
He took her squarely by the shoulders
Snap out of it
You know well enough that Oh hell
Quit being so much of woman She said distantly Did mention that Im considering accepting the fiveyear contract Max Sartman offered me last week to play in Stupendous Pictures Are you He leaned over and kissed her
She stepped back looked breathless said Well frankly no Oke said Oakley
The opening door disclosed French maid who escorted them into an amber lighted living room furnished with Span ish antiques
man past middle age hurried from chair to grasp Oakleys hand
He acknowledged the introduction to Cherry Morris with worried glance and blurted Im Sidney Sandwell Mr OakleyFaith Lees father
need your help Im here for just that Oakley an swered coolly taking chair
As Cherry seated herself he consulted his notebook
You returned to Hollywood later than you expected to when you telephoned me long distance night before last from Yuma Sidney Sandwells was an unpleasant pinched face his eyes moved restlessly
Yes yes he answered brushing ner vously at his grayed temples
You re ceived the telegram sent from Phoenix yesterday The one saying your return was de layed
did Ive only just got back Sandwell continued
phoned your office as soon as stepped into this house
Ive been driving from place to place trying to find Faith
Im at my wits end
thought shed run off with Brooks to be mar ried but Perhaps Oakley suggested wed better begin at the beginning Youyou know that Faith Lee my daughter is one of the most popular ac tresses in the studios
Her real name is Fay Sandwell
Her mother died years ago
She has been in pictures since nineteen thirty
Now shes almost at the top
Weve lived here for the last yearFaith and and Doctor Brenner my stepson by an earlier marriage
Day before yesterday Sandwell went on Faith came home from the stu dio early
Shed had slight heart at tack
She stayed in her room resting the remainder of the day
That eve ning when went in to see how she was feelingshe was gone
telephoned the studio and was told she wasnt there
Knowing that she she fancied herself to be in love with Vernon Brooks her director at Stupen dous telephoned his place
learned that Brooks was not at home
He had left the studio but no one knew where he was And you thought thought Sandwell said nervously that Faith and Brooks had suddenly de cided to get married and had run off to gether
Id tried to discourage her from considering Brooks as husband
was firmly convinced she shouldnt marry him
became genuinely alarmed Why dislike that young man
Besides Faiths contract has nonmarriage clause in it and the contract would automatically be broken see immediately telephoned Yuma Ari zonayou know California couples are always rushing there for quick marriages but could get no cooperation
Faith being of age
decided to drive to Yuma
Dime Detective Magazine arrived there after midnight but so far as could learn Faith and Brooks had not appeared
grew frantic
telephoned you then Mr Oakley because was afraidafraid something might have happened to Faith and wanted your help
stopped at every town along the way thinking perhaps they had gone be yond Yuma to avoid publicity
There was no word of them anywhere
wired you from Phoenix explaining that my return would be delayed
Mr Oakleyits possible shes been kidnaped Youve had no demand for ransom No
Ive been away but the servants tell me no word has come Your stepson the Doctor Brenner you mentioned was not here to receive
such word if it came He left the city the same night Faith disappeared
believe he went off for short vacation
dont know
Hes taciturn sort And Vernon Brooks the director is also missing Yes May see Miss Lees room CIDNEY SANDWELL led the way along the hall Oakley and Cherry Morris following briskly
They entered large modemly furnished bedroom completely in order
complete investiga tion showed that none of the girls clothes were missing
Oakley lifted an expensive purse from the dresser unclasped it and found small box containing many small white pills bedded on layer of cotton
These are he observed amyl nitrite pearlsused by victims of angina pectoris to alleviate attacks
Had she others on hand She was never without supply can assure you
Lack of amyl nitrite may mean death to sufferer from angina in case of an attack
If she left here of her own will she must have taken some with her yet cant say that she had oth Oakley opening compact found slip of paper inside it no longer or wider than thumb
On it was written in an unfeminine hand La Hacienda Arrow head
He kept the slip in his fingers shut the case eased his hand into his pocket
Look here he said sternly
If Miss Lee was kidnaped she must have been taken from his house at night If she left of her own accord she went at the same time
She was not alone here
Where is your roomand that of Doctor Bren ner Sidney Sandwell indicated two doors down the hall
Very close you see
Yet heard nothing And Doctor Brenner was gone at the time you discovered your daughters ab sence Yes Oakley entered the room of Doctor Norman Brenner
On bookshelves there were numerous volumes on biology and medicine
look into the adjoining bath room disclosed no shaving kit
Sand well brought Oakley photograph of middleaged cleanshaven studious look ing man
Thats Norman
His suitcase is not here
He packed and went without ex plaining where he was going or how long he would stay
The maid saw him drive away Then it isnt possible that your daugh ter went off somewhere with Doctor Brenner instead of with Vernon Brooks No
There are only two possible ways to explain her absence
She was abducted or she ran off with Brooks to get married But Oakley suggested once she was married to him which probably would have occurred soon after she left Death on Delivery she wouldnt deliberately refrain from getting in touch with youknowing her absence would worry you
Anyhow she wouldnt go off to get married undressed
The remaining possibility abduction seems not quite logical either Oakley pointed out because there has been no demand for ransom
She couldnt very well have been kidnaped from the house without disturbance which you surely would have heard
When we come right down to it we dont know what the devil has happened to Miss Faith Lee Sidney Sandwells eyes widened anx iously
am afraid shes been killedl Oakleys eyebrows arched
What reason would there be for any one killing her
How could she have been attacked here in this houseas she must have been since none of her clothes arc missingwithout either you or Doctor Brenner hearing some alarm Sandwells eyes became whitecircled
II dont know buttheretheres another circumstance Which youve been holding back on me Oakley diagnosed
Unless you tell me everything you know and at once Mr Sandwell will bow myself out of the case No please dont do that
need your help desperately
Ill tell you every thing know about it andhere He removed wallet from his pocket and paper slip from the wallet
He bent over writing desk in the bedroom and scribbled
Quickly he handed Oakley check written to the order of Sidney Sandwell and signed by Fay Sandwell to the amount of one thousand dollars
Sand well had just endorsed it to Clay Oak ley
Is that sufficient as retainer It is providing Come with me Sandwell led the way quickly from the bedroom talking breathlessly as he went
Of course youve seen the morning papers concern ing the accident on the Roosevelt High way in Santa Monica last night
The trunk that burst opencontaining dead mans bodya man still unidentified by the police know about it Oakley said
AND WELL led the way out the rear of the house into spacious flag stoned patio bordered by gardens lighted by the glow from the windows
The trunk was an old one with the initials on it Yes Like Sandwell exclaimed that He indicated trunk sitting near rear door of the house
It was of an old fashioned type worn and scarred by much travel
On each end near the leather handles was splotch of fresh black paint Oakley approached it in surprise
You can see Sandwell declared that the paint has been used to cover the initials but they still show through Oakleys eyes sharpened
Norman Brenner
Have you the keys Perhaps theyre in the store room
havent touched that trunk
found it only little while ago when got back
II dared not unlock it until you came He opened door near the trunk en tered store room filled with odds and ends of surplus house furnishings snatched ring of keys from nail and hurried back as another door opened and the French maid looked out
telephone call she announced for Mr Oakley Get it Cherry Oakley said taking the keys
Its probably Archie He thrust key into the lock as Cherry went into the house
Neither the first nor the second key turned
Sandwell kept talking
This trunk was kept in the store room
None of the ser vants know how or when it was brought Dime Detective Magazine out here
There were two trunks just alike in the store roombut the other one is gone The third key clicked and Oakley rose unfastening the dasps
You believe that the other trunk is the one which figured in the accident last night
Im afraid so Oakley threw up the lid of the trunk
He took breath said Evidently youre right Inside the trunk curled with knees brought up to chin clad only in under wear resting on matting of clothing lay the dead body of man
Good God Sandwell gasped
Thats Brooks Oakley looked grim Youre sure of that Ppositivel Sandwell blurted
Ive seen him many times
Hehes dead
Very dead Oakley agreed and add ed There in the cornerit looks like chauffeurs cap and tunic Archie as you suspected Oke Cherry said
An urgent telephone call has just come from Miss Claire Kent
She wants you at her house immediately Oakley nodded briskly
He took the telephone from Cherry and heard Archi bald Brixeys cultured voice sing over the wire
heard what Cherry told you Oke
Its exactly right
The lovely Miss Kent is shamefully upset Hop into taxi and meet me in front of her home Archie
Cherry is coming to the office to take your place
Im on my way
Oakley pronged the receiver and turned to see Sandwell staring white iy Whatwhat can we do Sandwell blurted
God its frightfulfinding that He broke off
Oakley you cant accept another case now
Ive retained you
Youve got to help me Youll get all my attention you need Oakley answered
take it youre far less concerned with what happened to Vernon Brooks than you are about your daughter
Neverthelesshere He pushed the telephone at Sandwell
The graytempled mans trembling hands awkwardly took it
Call headquarters Headquarters
But Its case for the police Oakley said briskly because murder is involved
Not one murder but twopossibly more
In such matters private detectives step into the background
Lose no time Mr SandwelL You thinkFaith may bedead Just say into that transmitter Police headquarters Oakley ordered
An ele phant named McClane will come tramping in here in no time CHAPTER THREE kAKLEY brought his sleek roadster to stop in front of another stucco house which sat prominently beside winding road in Beverly Hills
He had sent Cherry Morris by taxi to the offices of Secrets Incorporated with instruc tions for getting various information
Now he strode to the iron gate at which the elegant Archibald Brixey was wait ing
In he said
Remembering Miss Kent very clear ly Brixey answered comply with alacrity Oakleys ring at the door brought Japanese manservant who said when he read the investigators ard Miss Kent wait see you He led them along tap estried hallway to door at the rear and knocked
Brixey affixed his monocle in anticipation of the Kentian beauty but there was no answer
The manservant said Maybe she sleep She jolly well didnt sound sleepy Death on Delivery when she talked to me on the phone Brixey observed
She very upset all day the servant informed them
Very indispose
Very nervous
Doctor say she must be qui et
She be quiet now Too quiet Oakley thought
And aloud Open the door The brown hand thrust wide the way
Oakley and Brixey looked in upon love ly boudoir
huge bed satincovered its pastel sheets thrown backempty sat between broad windows one of which was wide open
Beside it lay pair of goldandblack mules
There was no Claire Kent in sight
the Jap suggested tactfully
Oakley nodded that they would wait then indicated the exotic mules
She would have worn those he began if she had left the bed to Glass crashed somewhere close at hand
Oakley spun about Brixeys monocle dropped
The Jap made throaty ex clamation which was drowned in loud er more alarming noise that thumped like brief thunder through the house
Then closely following it scream very like the one that had disturbed the sea air aboard the Ocean Casino the night beforea cry of terror
Oakley sprang through the door with Brixey at his heels
The Jap was run ning back and forth in the hallway hands fluttering helplessly
Oakley peering at other doors heard soft thud and felt the floor jar
He bounded forward once more his hand slipping his automatic from its armpit holster
Outside Another scream cooled his blood as he twisted at the doorknob
He pushed in upon startling sight
This was another bedroom and it had seen swift violence
standard lamp had fallen against French window cracking pane outward the sash was standing open
Beneath it
unconscious lying beneath billowing satin that she had pulled from the bed was Claire Kent
Otherwise Oakleys waving gun cov ered emptiness
He stepped over Miss Kent alertly peered out heard swift steps running through grass
dark move ment indicated that Archibald Brixey was going into action
Someone leaped across patch of garden beyond covered by darkness and Brixey shouted say
Stop Far at one edge of the lawn rustling sounded as the fleeing prowler fled through greenery
Oakley spotted Brixey sprinting in that direction and swerved to cut off the assailants escape
He leaped bushes whirled against stucco wall darted back
Out of the gloom came thump and moan
Somebody had gone down
HTHE hedge rippled as an unseen per son burst through it
Beyond heels gritted on the cement Oakley swung to push through met the obstruction of wall concealed behind the hedge and was forced to go farther along till he came to break
The roar of motor dinned into the quiet as he dived through
car was speeding without lights
Oakley whirled scratched his way back through the hedge saw Brixey un folding unsteadily from the grass and sped toward the house
He legged in through the same window and went into Claire Kents bedroom
The Jap was holding smelling salts be neath her comely nose and she was push ing the bottle away
Oakley took up the telephone and began to dial headquarters
Dont the actress beseeched sudden ly
Dont call the police Oakleys finger poised
Not the police The girls tone was so imploring her eyes so desperate that Oakley abandoned Dime Detective Magazine the phone
He trod back to the hall to find Brixey staggering an through the side door
That young mans aristocratic chin was marred by smear of blood
He Was mopping at it with his handkerchief ruffling his sparse hair and blinking
do wish he complained that we could take one case which wouldnt en tail my getting clipped on the head
That blighter hit me with telephone pole Oakley made disgusted noise and returned to the bedroom
Claire Kent lay clad only in filmy nightgown deli cately adorned with fine lace
She was confusedly gesturing the manservant away
Oakley stepped close draped die blue sheet over her beautiful form and nodded gravely when she said Thank you What happened he asked
was lying here dozing she told him echoing the alarm she had felt at the moment
was awakened by some one seizing me
hand closed over my mouth was pulled out of bed and into the next room
Somehow managed to break awayI think screamed
You did Oakley affirmed and thereby saved yourself from feeing dragged hut of the house
Did you see the face of the man who grabbed you Nomot mice prowler Oakley mused steals in through your bedroom window grabs you attempts to carry you away for the devil only knows what purposeand you de cline to have the polk notified
Why She sat up in alarm
Oaldey above everything elseno publicity
Not the slightest
No matter what has happened no matter what happensmy name has got to be kept out of this
Thats why want to retain you MotionPicture actresses Oakley ob served dont usually shy from pub licity She hesitated
Oakley youve got to understand
have no delusions about myself
Im featured player through sheer good luck
hold my own because of this manufactured beauty that Hollywood has given me
Its all Ive got ail that keeps me working
Butthere are thousands of other girls in Holly wood prettier than am far better ac tresses
One of them could take my place overnight and Id never be missed Oakley warmed to the girls refreshing frankness
At the moment he said gallantly find that difficult to believe Will you help me
she pled
Oakley thought
Ill do everything can to save you from unfavorable pub licity he said but circumstances may make that impossible
You see so far dont know what youre talking about except that you know whose dead body crashed out of die trunk on the Roose velt Highway last night Howhow did you know that She fairly gasped it
How did you Before the announcement came from the radio on the boat you were at ease Oakley told her
The moment you heard it you became terrified
You reoognized the description of the corpse in the trunk QHE nodded settling back again ab sorbed in troubled thought
Day before yesterday was working in thp studio with Faith Lee in When Lovers Part
Faith was taken ill and went home
Vernon Brooks the director filled out the day taking scenes in which Faith did not figure
We finished work early in the evening after dark
We were concerned about Faith so Brooks and decided to go to her house and see how she was
We went in my car
We were almost in front of Faiths heme when the door opened
The thing we saw startled all of us
man came out
He was carying girl in his arms
Death on Delivery She seemed to be otily partly clothed and unconscious
He stepped away quickly into the darkness and because it was all so surprising Anderson stopped our car outside the driveway Yes The man put the girl in car wait ing beside the house
He didnt notice us
Brooks said That was FaithI saw her face Just then the car shot out of the driveway
Anderson said Id bet ter follow that car It went like light ningseveral times we thought wed lost itbut we managed to follow it to building on the campus of the St Vin cent College You took its number
Oakley asked
didnt think of that Brooks did heard him repeat number but cant remember it now
Anderson must have noticed it too but in moment youll understand Its so horrible The girl steadied herself her face white as alabaster and continued
We stopped behind the car on the campus
It was dreadfully dark
Evi dently the man we had followed had car ried Faith inside the building
The win dows were curtained but some light was shining through the blinds
Brooks got out first and said Ill see what the devil this is all about He went to the door and knocked and when it opened he stepped in
We saw him stagger as though hed been hit and then the door closed quick ly
Anderson got out of the car ran to the door and tried to open it but it was locked
He called Mr
Brooks and there wasnt any answer
stayed in the car because was frightened
Anderson threw himself against the door
He did it three timesand the third time it flew open and he stumbled in Yes Oakley said again with mount ing interest
saw Anderson bring up short against long table
He was trying to regain his balance when an arm swung into view just an arm
Anderson was hit on the head by somethingterribly hard
He went down instantly
was terrified think screamed
Next that figure ap peared in the doorjust black silhou ette man with shoulders drawn down his face shaded by hatholding some thing heavy in his hand
He started to ward me And Oakley surmised you tried to get away jumped out of the car and ran
He came after me grabbed me
He struck at me and missed
twisted away and pushed him
He stumbled and fell
He was getting up when rushed back to the car
He was coming after me again when started off
got away from there as fast as couldso terrified hardly knew what was doing And all this time Oakley asked you didnt see this mans face It was pitch dark
All can remem ber was seeing him twice QHE swallowed
rushed off the cam pus in the car thinking only of tele phoning the police
didnt know what had happened
didnt know what the consequences of calling the police would be
realized that if murder had been committed would be involved
But anywayI was going to call the police But you didnt Claire Kent said wretchedly faint ed What
While driving No
felt it comingdizziness
was cold as ice
became afraid would lose control of the car
swung to the curb and stopped the motorand faint ed And then II dont know how long it was be fore came to
Apparently nobody had Dime Detective Magazine seen me
Id fallen over on the seat
was weak and sick
What remembered seemed like nightmare
began to re alize that if murder had been commit ted it would mean frontpage notoriety of the most sensational damaging sort
It was selfish of me admitbut drove home
didnt call the police
couldnt grave error Im afraid Miss Kent Oakley stated
made dreadful mistake but she declared it with admirable fierceness Im glad of it
Above all Im going to keep my career
Ive had to fight every inch of the way upIm going to be star within yearand refuse to throw all that away through sense of duty that might do no one else any good Understandable Oakley sympa thized
Certainly quite human
Go on came here
couldnt sleep
Those were the most nerveracking hours ever spent
Becausejust after got home the telephone rang
took the call in this room
It was mans voice Strange voice
It said Keep quiet
If you talk youll wreck your career The voice was speaking the very thought in my mind
If you talk Ill kill you That voice meant every word
Ill kill you it warned againand then it was gone The man who came here tonight Oakley suggested came perhaps to car ry out that threat
To eliminate the pos sibility of your talking Im sure of it
Im half mad with all this
You can never know how hor rible that night was to me nor the next dayyesterday
grew more and more hfraid as each hour passed because Brooks and Anderson never came back
tried to get my mind off it last tight by going out to the gambling ship
was there when Word came over die radio about the dead man in the trunk Yes
recognized the description im mediately
It was Anderson
That Oakley said suspected It was frightful shock
was ter rified
Seeing you my first thought was to ask your help
went outside after speaking with you because felt faint again
was walking along the deck when sawcoming out of doorway to ward me looking at methe same figure had seen before The man who had Carried Faith Lee from her house the one you had seen in the door of the campus building Yes
There was no mistake no pos sible mistake
recognized that figure standing against the light
knew that he had been following me watching me
must have cried out without knowing it
He came at melike madman
think he was infuriated because Id recognized him because Id raised cry
He grap pled with me threw me over the rail Yet Oakley told her youve called me in and youre telling me the story Theres no other way the actress de clared
And you must save me from the police VAKLEY looked thoughtful
Can you he asked dubiously tell good lie and stick to it no matter what hap pens Ill do anything All right
Heres your story
You left the studio that evening driven by Anderson in your car with Brooks ac companying you
You were tired after hard days work
You had Anderson drive you here
You came into the house and went to bed
Youre vague about the exact time and your maid must be too
The point is you came directly here from the studioyou didnt go to Faith Lees home Death on Delivery Yes Brooks had voiced his concern about Miss Leethis is still your story
You had Anderson drive him to Miss Lees home
Of what happened after that you know absolutely nothing whatever Yes Thats the story youve got to stick to
No matter how many cops bully you thats all you know
Your promise to that is necessary before go further with this matter
promise it
Ill do it In that case Oakley said rising Ill send you my billlater knock sounded upon the door
Brix ey rose opened it and the Japanese ser vant look in
Man see Miss Kent he moilthed
Name McClane
From head quars Oh Lord Oakley moaned
Claire Kent snatched at Oakleys hand
He thrust stem finger toward her shape ly nose
Stick to that story
Start tele phoning headquarters right now to tell them youve just learned that the dead body in die trunk is Andersons
Let Mc Clane interrupt you but dont let him bulldoze you
If you doyoure sunk To the Jap he directed Show that big ox in The anxious girls eyes followed him as he left the bedroom
The manservant was hurrying to the front entrance
Brix ey dabbing at his injured chin followed Oakley to the side door
They slipped out as McClanes heavy heelbeats started up the hallway
Oakley hurried to his roadster and slipped behind the wheel
He started the motor and said Im damned fool CHAPTER FOUR McClane Blunders In rpHE swinging headlamps of Oakleys roadster searched across velvet lawn as he followed the gravel roadway over the campus of St Vincents College
When he braked to stop the gleam dis closed painted words above doorway Biological Research
This is it Oakley said as he got out
The building was isolated from others in which lighted windows shone
Oakley went to the bleak door glanced back and pictured the episode related to him by the charming Claire Kent
About the place there was smell of death
The door as he expected was firmly locked
Oakley turned to the windows
Each was crisscrossed by heavy iron bars set into massive frames
The blinds were drawn
Oakley was half around the building when he paused at another door
The lock on the first entrance had been of formidable flatkey variety recent ly added but this was an ordinary type
Oakleys slender Langled steel pick probed into it and slid bade the bolt
With Brixey at his side he stepped into dark ness tinged with faint animal odor
He flashed his pocket light through sev eral doors and saw chairs and black boards
These were classrooms and of no interest to Oakley
At the end of the corridor he found locked door
Again tumbler mechanism defied him
The lab is protected like vault Nevertheless he tried his pick
It was squeaking in the lock when Brixey said suspiciously smell smoke Oakley straightened
So do Somewhere outside cry sounded
The second time it was intelligibleFire Oakley began to move quickly
Long strides carried him along the corridor as he thrust open swinging doors
He stopped short with red light glar ing in his face
He was looking into classroom which he had passed by on his way to the inner entrance of the research laboratory
Flames were leaping among chairs piled up in the center of the floor
Dime Detective Magi Oiled wood was spreading carpet of fire and varnish was crackling
Oakley sidled out the door through which he had come
On the side of the building opposite his car flaming red was flickering through window
Across the campus dark figures were running
As they legged close the glow disclosed them to be coatless hatless excited students
Dormitory windows were sliding up in the buildings beyond and silhouetted heads were poking out
Oakley slipped past the corner
He was in his car and starting up when Brixey folded down beside him
The tires ground in the gravel as the roadster swerved toward the distant gate
Well hope Oakley observed as he twisted into boulevard that none of the students sighted us and start trailing us
Theyll put that fire out in jiffy
The only damage done is postponement of our burglarious activities
Were com ing back Archie BRIGHT desk lamp gleamed in the inner sanctum of Secrets Incorpor ated
Oakley had driven directly to his office
Now he had before him numer ous reports prepared by the efficient and beguiling Charmaine Morris
As Brixey slumped in an easy chair he jigsawed them together
Faith Lee Report from Dr Emanuel Brose her physicianMiss Lee afflicted with angina pectoris
Disease unusual under middle age and women less vulnerable than men but had it
Like all angina sufferers she faced sudden death at any moment
Hard work in studios endangered her life
Some times used amyl nitrite pearls on set
Report from Stupendous StudioF
being paid weekly on longterm con Report from Second National Bank Bev erly HillsAccount in name of Fay Sand well
Frequent checks for large amounts written to order of Sidney Sandwell
Sidney Sandwell Typical Hollywood father
lived on his daughters income loose and extravagant Genuinely fond and proud of his daughter but apparently his chief interest in her the money she gave him
No life insurance
Her death will leave Sandwell without income hence his anxiety
Left Washington University medical school education uncompleted to marry Elizabeth Brenner widow with son Nor man
Resents stepsons success as scientist Elizabeth Brenner died two years later
Married Ruth Kilgore daughter Fay by her
Mother dead five years
Very poor until Fay got footing in movies
Strong financial reasons Oakley murmured for Sandwefls wanting his daughter to remain safe and prosperous He turned to the next report Dope on cadavers Marks on both corpses identical
Hands and feet of Anderson and Brooks severely frozen
This in our balmy climate In each large vein in the thigh had been opened apparently after death for very little blood flowed
In each needle punc ture unusually large over heart piercing to right auricle but this was not cause of death
In each case blows on head suffi ciently violent to cause unconsciousness but not death
Carbon dioxide content of lungs very high death due to suffocation
Since the thigh veins were opened after death suffocation could not have taken place in side the trunks unless the men were put into trunks suffocated removed operated upon then returned to trunks
This is un likely since in that case men must have been brought to Lee home alive then killed and operations performed there
Indications are that both men were murdered in some strange fashion elsewhere then brought to Lee home and put into trunks
Both deaths occurred night of th exact time uncer tain
Archie asked Oakley of his assis tant see if you can get any response from Doctor Brenners biological labor atory at St Vincent College Brixey took up the telephone as Oak ley unfolded yet another report
Death an Delivery Dope on trunks Both were in store room of Lee home
Servants cannot say when they were brought out hut think it was following dinner on the th
Property of Norman Brenner
At on the th the Coast wise Trucking Company of Los Angeles re ceived telephone call from man who said he was Dr Norman Brenner address that of Lee home
He wished truck to come and pick up two trunks
One was to be driven to National Express Company depot in Santa Barbara
The other was to he taken to freight depot in Hollywood and
shipped collect to San Francisco
The expressmen called at the Lee home next morning
They picked up the trunk which was to go to Santa Barbara
It stayed local express office until truck left on regtdar run that night
Trunk never reached Santa Barbara because of accident on Roosevelt Highway
It was doubtless the murderers intention to go to Santa Bar bara and ship the trunk out of there to confuse tracing it
Accident upset this plan
The other trunk to be taken to Holly wood freight office was not picked up by the express truck
Reason the trunk was not crated
Trunks may be shipped as are by express but are not accepted for freight shipment unless crated
Killer evidently did not know of this regulation
Result trunk containing dead body of Vernon Brooks was left at the Lee home
Brixey put down the telephone
No answer from the lab he asserted
That probably means the fire was put out and nobody went into the lab Oak ley asserted and took up the report on Doctor Brenner
No information available concerning Dr Brenners experiments
His work has been financed with funds donated by the college mid by the CWA Reason for secrecy not explained
Brenner had indicated his intention of go ing away for few days rest but told no one where he was going or when
Accord ing to servants at Lee house left in his own car late on evening of th about Nothing about him in news papers
Police are searching for him quiet ly no public alarm issued
Doctor Brenners flight and contin ued absence said Brixey would seem to indicate guilt We must not forget Oakley remind ed him that we have two purposes in this case
One is to locate Faith Lee
The other is to save Claire Kent from ruinous scandal TROM the outer office came commo idon hat straightened Oakley in his chair
voice rumbled and heavy foot falls crossed the carpet purposefully
The door flung open and on the sill appeared DetectiveLieutenant McClane
Cherry Morris voicing protests was tugging in dignantly at one of his arms striving to keep him out
He ignored her gnawed mi cigar glared ominously at Oakley
Call your redhead off Stop risking your precious life
Cher ry
Oakley commanded
McClane do come in
hope you trip over the rug and break your neck McClane tramped to the desk
Just why he demanded have you your fan cy finger in this murder pie
Talk fast and dont try to kid me asked Oakley
You suspect me of so many things McClane
Some day youll try to jail me for stealing the Mona lisa out of the Louvre Come on McClane snarled
You had good reason for being at Kents place last night
Her story sounds fishy enough to make me sure you cooked it up for her Need you Oakley asked be so un complimentary Listen McClanes cigar shifted threateningly
All yesterday Kents chauffeur was missingbut she says she didnt know it
That smells Hie young lady was ill in bed all yes terday Oakley countered because of the unpremeditated plunge into the Pacific which you witnessed the previous night Dime Detective Magazine McGane
Naturally she didnt use her car naturally she didnt call upon her chauffeur
What could be more reason able than her not knowing about him So shes hired you has she Mc Gane demanded
Her chauffeur gets killed in cockeyed way and she doesnt know anything about itso why does she need private detective To save herself from being trampled on by rhino named McGane Oakley answered
Theres no reason for drag ging her into the case and ruining her career and Im going to see that you let her alone
Theres your answer if you can grasp it McGane heaved closer
Just tell me something shamus
If Anderson the chauffeur drove Brooks from Kents place to Lees house and never showed up againhow come the car he drove is back in Kents garage right now and has been ever since the murder Oakley uttered silent moan
Brixeys monocle dropped and his face flashed pale
How come that McGane demanded
Oakley said quietly How should know You know all right
Kents story doesnt click
If Anderson didnt drive that car back himselfwho did
Ill tell you
Somebody who knows what hap pened to him
Somebody whos holding out and trying to slide from under
Some body whos mixed right into the middle of these killings and trying to play inno centKent Oakley sprang to his feet
McGane he snapped get the hell out of here be fore bounce you out McGane blinked
Im going all right he rumbled
When see you again Oakley Ill have warrant for you
Wisecrack out of that iAKLEY sat down and mopped his face
Brixey replaced his monocle which rapidly fogged with the moisture oozing from his pores
Cherry Morris said with caught breath Oh Oke
You fool The detail of Miss Kents car being in her garage Brixey exclaimed is one you jolly well overlooked Oke Youre telling me Oakley removed from his wallet the slip of paper hed purloined from Faith Lees bedroom
He gazed at it intently and said Cherry youre coming with me
Bring stenographic notebook and plenty of sharp pencils
Archie hold down the fort
Weve got to move fast to keep one jump ahead of McClane or hell collar me Fool Oakley snapped as he slipped behind the wheel of his roadster is cor rect
It wouldnt be so bad if McGane werent dead right The car shot onto the Boulevard and turned swiftly east
Where asked Cherry are we go ing so precipitously Straight said Oakley from the frying pan into the fire no doubt CHAPTER FIVE Challenge of Death VAKLEY drove swiftly through sub urbs
Presently he was sending the car up steep winding road
At the end of an hour he approached neat little town sitting at the edge of sparkling mountain lakeArrowhead
He drew into parking space before an impressive stucco hotel at the edge of the water
With Cherry Morris at his side he strode into the lobby and of the desk clerk he inquired This La Hacienda Yes want to see your register for the last Death on Delivery few days beginning with the night of the tenth
We never the clerk began to pro test but the crisp crinkle of twenty dollar bill in his hand changed his frown to an obliging smile
Oakley stepped behind the desk looked rapidly through an index of registration cards
He lifted one from the Bs read the name of Doctor Norman Brenner and said Ah The blue timestamp on the card he studied closely
Doctor Bren ner he asked arrived here at about twelve thirty on the night of the tenth Yes
Hes been here ever since Yes
Doing what Resting all the time evidently except for few swims in the lake and hike or two around it
Is he in or out at the moment In Were going up Oakley declared unannounced They went up to the sixth floor
Oak ley knocked at door the number of which corresponded with that recorded on the registration card
It was opened by middleaged man with tired face and rumpled hair
He was clad in blue bathrobe and red slippers and regarded them curiously
Doctor Norman Brenner Yes We are coming in said Oakley
They entered the room of the man for whom the Los Angeles police were searching at that very moment
Oakley bolted the door
Doctor Norman Brenner looked amazed then indignant then troubled
What do you want Information Oakley said crisply
Im private detective
Youll be wise to answer my questions
Need add that the case involves murder and youre sus pected What nonsense is this Brenner ex claimed
VAKLEY gestured to Cherry who sat down crossed exquisite legs and poised needlepointed pencil above her stenographers notebook
Oakley sig naled Brenner to chair leaned dose and proffered the small slip of paper on which the name and location of the hotel was written
Ever see that before Yes
Its my writing Cherrys pencil made hieroglyphs in her notebook as the words were uttered
You gave that slip to Faith Lee Yes
Look here
Why the devil are you Dont ask questions Oakley snapped
Answer them
You are on what is com monly called spot
Doctor Brenner
Very shortly bull named McClane is go ing to grab you and youll find it an un pleasant experience
If you want square deal talk nowtell me where can find Faith Lee and why you killed two men named Brooks and Anderson Brenner swallowed
Why dont know what youre talking about Surely Oakley pressed you read the papers
You know of the deaths of Anderson and Brooksthat both bodies were found in trunks bearing your ini tials My trunks
You mean Miss Kents chauffeur and Faiths director
Newspa pers
havent looked at one since came up here Oakley sat back
This he opined is going to be difficult for you as well as for me
tell you frankly IVe got to turn up murderer in hurry in or der to save myself from the very unpleas ant legal consequences of rash act
Im going to do it no matter who gets the chair
Youre going to talk Dime Detective Magazine Talk
Youve startled me so that can hardly think Doctor Brenner ex claimed in dismay
The less thinking and the more re membering you do the better Oakley snapped
Now answer my questions
What time did you leave your home on the night of the tenth Im not sure of the exact time
finished work at the lab drove home had dinner went to my room and lay down
was very tired and unintentionally fell asleep
When awoke packed and left When It was past ten What you are saying Oakley stated is that you were asleep at the time the murders were evidently committed
That must point out is no alibi at alL Its the truth You drove straight here Certainly You took an uncommonly long time about it Im very slow and cautious driver An ordinary driver would have reached here in half the time you took Perhaps but came directly You gave that slip with the address of this hotel on it to Faith Lee before you left Yes late that afternoon Why So she could get in touch with me if necessary Where was she when you left the house In her bedroom suppose You suppose spoke through the door to say good bye but there was no answer and as sumed she was sleeping You didnt telephone an express com pany
You didnt go to your laboratory on the campus of St Vincent College aft er you left the house No AKLEY said firmly Doctor Bren ner Im forced to the conclusion that either youre entirely innocent of what happened or youre lying with amazing facility Im telling the truth You would say so in any case Oak ley went on relentlessly
The big point is this
The man who committed these murders was seen leaving Miss Lees house after dark on the night of the tenth carrying Miss Lee apparently un conscious in his arms
He drove direct ly to your biological laboratory and went Thats impossible Doctor Brenner blurted
Im the only person who has keys to that laboratory There are no others in existence None
always carry them in my vest pocket
Here they are He lifted two flat keys from his vest pocket each duplicate of the other
Oakley took them
These keys were on your person when you lay down after dinner Yes They were still there when you awoke Yes Oakley sighed
shouldnt like to face McClane if were you with story as weak as that
Now listen
want to know the exact nature of your secret ex periments in the biological laboratory My experiments said Doctor Nor man Brenner are devoted to restoring the dead to life Oakley sat up
Cherry Morris pencil paused
They glanced at each other as though doubting the mans sanity
Doctor Brenner merely looked at them
You mean to tell me Oakley asked Death on Delivery him that conservative college and the CWA have advanced funds to you for experiments in resurrecting the dead do Doctor Brenners eyes lighted
It may sound fantastic to you
As matter of fact there is nothing startling about it
have succeeded several times in restoring dead bodies to life Humans Oakley blurted
In my experiments have used dogs cats and rabbits Oakley took breath and said Please explain
am not the only man working on these experiments
You may have read of those conducted by Doctor Robert Cornish who was once mem ber of the staff of the University of Cal ifornias Institute of Experimental Biol ogy
He was conducting his experiments until recently in building on the uni versity campus
The publicity given his work led to his being asked to remove himself
have maintained strict secrecy about my own work in order to proceed unmolested
Hmmmf Doctor Cornish and both use teeter boards for simulating the circulation of blood once the dead heart begins func tioning again
solutionsaturated with oxygen containing the heart stimulant adrenalin and the liver extract heparin and some blood from which the coagu lating substance fibrin has been removed is introduced into the circulatory sys tem through the thigh vein The thigh vein Oakley repeated
Circulation is then restored by rocking the dead body on the teeter board massaging it and blowing into the mouth to stimulate respiration
My experiments Doctor Brenner continued are based on groundwork done by Doctor George Washington Crile of Cleveland thirty years ago and also on experiments conducted at the Mayo Clinic in twentynine
Doctor Al bert Solomon Hyman of the Witkin Foundation for the Study and Preven tion of Heart Disease in Manhattan de veloped another method which adopt edthat of prodding the dead heart into action by electric impulses
In this case resuscitation apparatus called hyma notor is used
hollow goldplated needle is thrust into the right auricle of the heart Oakley swallowed
What And through the bore of the needle an insulated electric wire is inserted to complete the circuit
generator sup plies the current and in six cases out of ten the heart action starts again if it has not been suspended for more than twelve minutes kAKLEY asked pointedly And this method has never been used on hu mans Doctor Cornish said Brenner tried last year to revive man who was dead five hours of heart diseaseusing oxy gen and the teeterboard but no injection and failed
determined not to attempt to resurrect humans until the technique of bringing lower animals back to life is per fected for an excellent reason Which is When blood stops flowing through the brain for even short time chemical change takes place in the brain cells
The animals revived are living in coma as result of this action
Months or years may pass before the mental facili ties are completely restored to normal
human revived after an hour of death might live an idiot or go mad or exist in coma
Until that difficulty can be overcome in some way You have no associates in your ex perminents have had several none now
Ive explained the technique to number of Dime Detective Magazine persons swearing them to secrecy about the work
have personally of course conducted every experiment in the labor atory and have taken care that no one else ever touched my apparatus You have Oakley insisted never attempted to resurrect dead human Never
Yet naturally do not in tend to devote my life to resurrecting dead mongrels
My great aim is to be enabled to bring life back to men and women who have died of hemorrhage shock asphyxiation and heart paralysis
Then the scientists eyes gleamed brilliantly then will have achieved one of the most astounding miracles of modem science Oakley studied the intense gleam in the doctors eyesand shivered
One more question
Doctor Brenner
Did you kill Anderson and Brooks Certainly not Very well then
Did you attempt to restore them to life after they had been killed No Oakley sighed and signaled Cherry Morris to transcribe no more of the con versation
Listen to me Doctor Bren ner
want you to stay herehere in this room from now on
Dont go out
Dont telephone
Have your meals brought up
Watch yourself
And in case youre found here by the policeyou havent seen me
Understand that Yes but Thats all Oakley strode out thrusting into his pocket the keys of Doctor Brenners lab oratory
CHAPTER SIX Trunk Number Three AKLEY stopped his roadster near the biological research laboratory on the campus of St Vincent College
Cherry accompanied him to the big door
The pungent smell of charred wood was in the air but no one was about
After pre cautionary moment of listening Oakley slid key into the lock
White light splashed upon him as an other car drew up behind the roadster
The long Brixey unfolded from it and walked with another man across gritting gravel
That you Oke
started as soon as you phoned got Mr Sandwell and here we are Sidney Sandwell asked anxiously Have you no word from Faith None unfortunately Oakley an swered turning the key
want you here because this is the first real lead weve found pointing to what may have hap pened to her Brixey gasped Where what
Oakley stepped in and thumbed light switch
Gleaming bulbs glared down upon strange apparatus
He noted the teeterboard mentioned by Doctor Bren ner bent glass tubes supported by clamps on standards electrical meters hand bellows attached to cupshaped rubber inhalator like small gasmask
Observe Oakley invited the devices used to bring the dead back to life His continued tour of the laboratory brought him to huge white enameled case in one comer
He opened one door and felt stinging cold flow outcold that bit to the very bones of the hand he in serted into the interior
In racked test tubes inside rested cultures of bacilli and jars containing animal tissues in al cohol
His eyes glinted as he shut the queer refrigerator and went on
door on the opposite side of the lab oratory opened into hallway which con nected with adjoining rooms
Oakley leading the procession discovered two wire cages containing mongrels who gazed about stupidly as if drunk
And observe Oakley said cadavers Death on Delivery returned to life by the magic of science Gazing intently at Sidney Sandwell he asked Have you ever had reason to doubt your stepsons sanity Thatthats most difficult question to answer Would you Oakley pressed con sider him capable of deliberately killing humans in order to provide himself with specimens for his experiments in resur rection Good God Sandwell blurted
You cant suspect him of that Oakley retorted can suspect any one of anything without half trying
asked you that last question because it seems very likely though not certain that Doctor Brenner has done exactly that Killedkilled humans in order to re vive them VAKLEYS eyes glittered
Think about it
For years Doctor Brenner has worked on these secret experiments
He has successfully revived lower ani mals
His technique may be advanced farther than he admits
His great aim has been to perfect it so that in certain cases humans may be revived from death
For his most important experiments he would need human subjects would he not Corpses Oakley continued while Brixey stared and Cherry Morris shud dered not too long dead
Dead in fact only few minutes
Obviously such cadavers are rarely available for scientific experiments
The only solution of the problem of supply is Doctor Brenner must make his own corpses
See the logic of it Oakley went on firmly
Assume that Brenners tech nique is perfected that human subjects are necessary that they must be newly dead
He would reason that if the dead is returned to life immediately killing subject is not murder
If he conducted his ghastly experiment on someone to whom he was dear he cotild enlist that persons promise of secrecy after the res urrection and so escape all legal conse quences You meanFaith Sandwell ejacu lated hoarsely
You think he did that horrible thing to her But say Oke Brixey protested
That leaves out Anderson and Brooks completely Not Oakley answered if they threatened to interrupt the experiment when every moment was precious not if they had to be put out of the way in or der for it to proceed God Sandwell exclaimed again
Those marks on the bodies of Anderson and Brooksthe fact that they were not clothedNorman showed me several times the incisions he made the needle he usedGood heavens the man must be stark mad And in that case Oakley went on grimly Miss Faith Lee Heavy steps gritting in the gravel out side interrupted
Hard knuckles beat the door
The knob rattled and voice howled through Open up Oakley moaned as the fists slammed at the panels again
He said resigned ly Open the door Archie before it bursts into splinters
Its our pal
Lieu tenant McClane Open up McClanes voice bellowed again
know youre in there Oakley Cherry Morris looked terrified as Brix ey drew the latch of the door and was overwhelmed by the lumbering entrance of the big plaindothesman
uniformed squadcar man followed him in
McClane charged at Oakley and ex ploded Howd you get in here Oakley sighed
With keys McClane Whered you get those keys decline to answer Oakley said
On the ground that it might incriminate me Dime Detective Magazine You can keep your trap shut and youre still plenty incriminated
Mc Gane stormed
Only one guy had keys lo this lab and thats Brenner
You got em from him
You know where he is
Thats one more count against you
Oak ley youre under arrest can find no flaw in your logic Mc Gane Oakley retorted
But logic isnt warrant This is McClane flipped folded document be neath Oakleys nose
Cherry Morris low ered herself into chair
Brixey scowled and stepped forward pugnaciously
Oak ley inspected the warrant
Very well he sighed
Im under arrest
Youve got me McClane Ho boomed McClane triumphantly
All right wiseacre
Wheres Brenner That Oakley countered Ill keep to myself while
dont want him swooped down upon by horde of your carnivor ous cops
In the interests of my client must talk with him
Ill send Archie
You will not
All three of you are under arrest
Youre all going to stick with me
How do you like that Not at all Oaldeys eyes grew dan gerously bright Dont get ugly Mc Gane
And dont be fool
You want murderer
Play ball with me and youll get him cCLANE frowned suspiciously
Your word of honor that youll bring Brenner right hereright now
Ill take chance on thathoping you dont keep your promise
Because if you dont well get Brenner anyway and thatll be ane more charge against yon Grimly Oakley took the arm of Sidney Sandwell and drew the man aside
He ipoke softly so that the glaring McClane jould not hear
Youll find Brenner at La Hacienda at Arrowhead
Drive up there as fast as you can go get him and bring him right back Yes said Sandwell
Yes Oakley conducted him to the door
The second car outside spurted away Sand well in it as McGane tugged Oakley back
He demanded the keys of the lab and got them
Oakley gestured him aside went to the telephone in the comer and called long distance
He asked for connection with La Hacienda at Arrowhead
Connect me with Doctor Brenner he requested of the hotel operator
Im sorry sir
Doctor Brenner is no longer here
He checked out little while ago Oakley swallowed
He pushed the phone away peered at McClane and asked If by any chance dont produce Doctor Brenner Itll be just too bad for you shamus
Because weve got all the dope we need on Brennersee
made the president of this college talk
know what the marks on those bodies mean
Which McClane added ominously will make it just that much tougher for you if Bren ner doesnt show up can see that Oakley stepped closer
McClane came here for reason
want proof of the murderer as much as you doin fact far more
Im going to get it
Howl all you damned please but Im going to search this building from top to bottom He morosely signaled Brixey and Cherry Morris to follow went into the connecting hallway to the door opening into the lower room
McClane and the squadcar cop tramped after them as they went down the steps
Oakley searched for light switch
He found one clicked it but no light came
Bulb must be burned out he said
Got torch flashlight in the hand of the patrol man shot beam ahead
Oakley stepped into cementwalled windowless under Death on Delivery ground room
The beam of the torch showed heavy racks loaded with discarded apparatus bundled recordsand single large trunk
Oakley paused peering at the trunk
McGane said Hello and tramped to it
solid thump sounded
McClane looked around curiously
Brixey gestured
It came from up there Cherry Morris added Some body at the door McClane grunted Huh and Oakley trod to the base of the steps
The door he said is closed AKLEY climbed the flight pushed at the door looked startled and pushed again
It was set immovably in its frame
He stooped squinted through the keyhole and saw key being withdrawn
It van ished
Its not only closed he said quietly straightening
Its locked
Somebodys shut us in here McGane tramped up shouldered against the door and paused hearing quick footfalls on the floor beyond
Someone it was evident was moving about the laboratory
McGane beat his fists on the panels and bellowed Let us out
Open this door The answer was silence
They went back down
The torchlight sought out wooden box in one corner disclosing inside it odds and endsan old tirepump pair of pliers hank of in sulated wire and flat tool for removing automobile shoes from wheel rims
That Oakley said might do it McClane thrust the implement toward the man with the torch
Get busy Fisher
Break the bolt on that door
Im going soft grinding sound silenced him
It was coming from above
The torch in Fishers hand swung upward to joists and floorboards
The cutting noise vibrated through the wood
Then in the gleam
light point of metal shone as it pierced
What the hell McGane blurted
bit Oakley said
Hey McGane bellowed upward
Let us out of here
Open that door suspect Oakley said your noise is quite useless Again as he spoke the sharp point spi raled through the wood again the bit pushed through and was withdrawn
Without moments delay the grinding sound came once more
McClanes police positive flashed in the light and raised
Oakleys hand gripped it
Bullets wont drive that roan back to unlock that door he pointed out and they might wipe out the possibility of very necessary confession third time the bit pierced Standing and staring will do us no good Oakley stated
That trunk inter ests me He strode to it
McGane grunted again and shoved him aside
The big detective stooped to pull it away from the wall it was heavy
He snatched thr oreiron from Fishers hand and tackled the closed lock
While metal squeaked under the levered power of McGanes huge muscles the revolving bit again drove through the ceiling at point foot removed from the first row of three holes
Oakley watched McGane as Qierry Morris hand stole into his
Brixey ad justed his monocle
McGane heaved broke the lock and quickly unclasped the fasteners
The lid swung up
The light of the torch probed deep into the trunk
An involuntary gasp came irons Mc Gane
Oakleys eyes narrowed
Gad only in pink slip her bare knees drawn updead obviously deadlay the body of beautiful girl
Too bad Oakley said softly
Lee Dime Defective Magazine CHAPTER SEVEN The White Doom TlTcCLANE snapped erect
By God that clinches it
Right here beneath the lab
Look at those marks on her
cut on the thigh the same as the others
Fisher get at that door
Crack it open For moment there was no sound save the quickened breathing of those around the trunk then Fisher bounded up the stairs with the tireiron
From the door came the sharp creaking of metal as Fisher pried the tool
Notice said Oakley quietly that the Condition of this corpse is not quite the same as the two others
The hands and feet of this girl show no signs of having been frozen What of it McClane demanded
Shes deadmurdered
Brenner killed her
What the double hell is going cm up there The light was now in McClanes hand he swung it toward the ceiling as fast rasping sound echoed in the cellar
The bit had rapidly bored out square pat tern
Now the thin blade of saw was biting from one cluster of holes toward another
McClane blurted Ill get that door open He legged up the steps shouldered Fisher aside and tackled the crack of the door with the sharppointed tod
The edge was scarred and dented but the frame had not budged
Oakley watched the saw cut ting through third side of the square and closed the lid of the trunk
Murder he murmured
In this case perhaps not Oke dont care how many murders have been Committed or who did them Cherry Morris blurted
McClanes got youhes going to take fiendish delight in destroying you Oakley seemed not to hear
Perhaps he repeated thoughtfully not murder crash sounded above
section of flooring less than foot square split downward and fell into the darkness
shoe was visible rapidly withdrawing
Then swiftly something white and solid tumbled through the opening and thumped to the cement below
What the devil is that Brixey ex claimed
McClane lumbered down the steps and stared
His light played upon the block of white
It was colorless as snow white fumes were drifting from it flowing vis cidly over the floor
He ducked away as another block of white spilled down from the opening
Spattering fragments flew from it as it struck
Through the aperture third and fourth block tumbleda fifth sixth
Then quickly the opening in the floor was covered
What in hell is that stuff McClane blurted
Nothing so strange Oakley answered quickly
Archie lift
Make it snappy There came the sound of something heavy being rolled on casters to point di rectly above
It stopped suddenly
Oakley spun Brixey to position be neath the now covered hole
He eeled him self to Brixeys shoulders reached for the linoleum that had been drawn above the hole and pushed hard
It bulged an inch and met heavy obstruction
He dropped breathless snatched the torch from McClanes hand and turned it upon the fuming bricks
Dry ice he said
You mean the stuff thats used to pack ice cream McClane demanded
What the devil was it thrown down here for For the purpose Oakley said of murder
We may now stand back and con template death by suffocationall of us Oke Cherry Morris cried
Death on Delivery This is no time for wise cracks Mc Clane stormed
How can that stuff kill us
And if it can Footfalls were moving rapidly across the floor above
click sounded as if the laboratory lights had been switched out
Then silence
The man up there Oakley said quietly is our murderer TITcCLANE whirled
Keep at that door Fisher
Burst that lock and as the staring squadcar man whirled up the steps Whatre you talking about suffocation
That stuff Dry ice Oakley explained staring at the fuming white blocks is solidified car bon dioxide
Carbon dioxide will not support life
You see it now turning from solid to gas
The gas given off is many times the volume of the solid
Theres enough of that stuff here to fill this en tire cellarand no way of getting either ourselves or it out except possibly Is that straight McClane swallowed
Watch said Oakley
He brought his cigarette lighter from his pocket and flicked it to flame
Then he lowered it to the floor and slowly brought it close to fuming block
The flame blinked out
Breathing that stuff will put us out not quite so quickly but just as effectively Cherry Morris was standing with parted lips watching Oakleys grim face
Mc Clane turned shade paler
You mean to say he blurted that that gas is going to keep coming offthat theres no way to stop itand itll choke us to death Exactly Oakley answered as it choked Anderson and Brooks to death
This room is airtight
Very shortly well begin to suffocateif we dont get out of here McClane peered grimly at the ceiling and pointed his gun
IU get that guy Which wont help us particle
News papers might Oakley suggested
Cloth anything
Look around He snatched the light from McClane and swung the beam upon the shelves found one of the bundles of records to be thickly packed blueprints
He whipped the paper out approached one of the steaming blocks
Dont touch the stuff with bare hands he warned
Its temperature is hundred and nine degrees below zero centigrade
Itll freeze your fingers in flash Thats what happened to the feet and hands of Anderson and Brooks then McClane blurted
But not Oakley aid rising to Miss Lee Protecting his hands by the thick pa per he held one of the fuming white blocks
Quickly he carried it up the steps
Fisher was prying frantically at the solid door sweating mumbling curses
Oak ley shouldered him aside and pressed the white block hard against the door under the knob
The air was thickening
The fuming block in Oakleys papercovered hands was growing perceptibly smaller its cor ners blunting as it dimished
The intense cold bit through the paper into his fingers but he continued to press the block hard against the metal
Get the hell away Oakley McClane snapped
Weve got to break out of here Well never get out of here using that tireiron alone Oakley answered grimly
Perhaps you know McClane but prob ably you dont that intense cold makes metal brittle
When the bolt of the lock gets thoroughly chilledwho can tell
In the meantime everybody stay on the steps
The gas is coming up like water Charmaine Morris was breathing heav ily
Brixey looked anguished
Listening Oakley heard footfalls again through the floor someone was moving about the laboratory
He said Hold that tire iron ready for some quick workbut weve got to wait little longer Dime Detective Magazine Godthat stuff McOane choked
Oakley pressed harder fingers numbed
Our man he said is waiting to make sure no one comes to liberate us before the gas lays us low
He got the stuff from the germculture refrigerator in the lab just as he did when he killed Anderson and Brooks McClane gasped Hurry it up kAKLEY smiled wryly
Does it mean anything to you McClane that no part of Faith Lees body was frozen as the others were by this damnably odd stuff
Does it mean anything to you that there is no blueness on her skin McClane blurted Let me get at that door Trying to break out before the bolt becomes brittle would be waste of time Oakley pointed out dryly
Clustered on the stairs the five breathed laboriously
The atmosphere was taking on heavy deadliness
Foggy white fumes floated higher above the floor mist streamed from the block clamped against the door by Oakleys numbed hands
Those details about Miss Lee Oak leys voice came quietly mean that she was not murdered and that she did not die of asphyxiation Never mind that now She died Oakley persisted of sim ple heart failure
All the facts point to it no clothes missing from her home for instance
An autopsy will prove it
Fol low it through McClane
Theres only one possible explanation You tell me McClane sneered while choke to death Ill tell you Oakley answered levelly while you gamble on the only chance youve got of living
The man who later killed Anderson and Brooks brought faith Lee here in desperate attempt to tesurrect her Brenner sure
Stark crazy and grab bing at chance to experiment Oakley continued imperturbably That man was seen carrying the girl out of Miss Lees home by Anderson and Brooks
They followed him here
He was in the laboratory preparing to resur rect the girl when they interrupted
Pic ture it
man frantically anxious to re store dead girl to life faced with intol erable delay at the hands of men who could not understand what he was doing McClanes chest was heaving heavily but he was listening
Every second was precious
There was no time to argue
The desperate man solved the situation by knocking Brooks and Anderson out
Then free of inter ruptions he made the attempt to resur rect the dead girl
But he failed For Gods sake weve got to get that door open Fisher coughed
In moment
That man had not killed Miss Lee but he realized that re moving and mutilating her body would mean grave consequences
In order to save himself he had to eliminate the two witnesses to his deed
He dragged Ander son and Brooks into the closets tossed chunks of dry ice in with them and closed them in
They were lying on the floor the stuff froze parts of their bodies and suffocated them The door Oke Brixey urged
Oakley persisted grimly
He then found it necessary to dispose of the bod ies
He hid Miss Lee in the trunk down here
There being no other way
he car ried the bodies of Anderson and Brooks to the Lee home and put them in the other trunks
The rest Oakley stepped back with gasp
He dropped the diminished chunk of dry ice and it fell splitting on the cement below
The tireiron He pried its point deep into the crack and bore back
McClane Death on Delivery grabbed his wrists and added poundage to the pull
In the laboratory quick steps sounded
Heels beat across the floor and stopped as the gritting of tires in the gravel outside carried faintly through the chilled door
Again there were footfalls and the click of light switch
Crackl Brittle metal snapped
Oakley heaved out the door
McClane charged past him slammed into the laboratory and pulled out his gun
Oakley came close be hind to see the weapon leveled at the mid dle of frightened pale cowed man of middle ageDoctor Norman Brenner
Got you McClane roared
AKLEY glanced once to see that Cherry Morris was safe and signaled Brixey to the outer door
He ignored McClanes bellow and stepped between the gun and Brenner
told you to stay at Arrowhead II couldnt the scientist protested
When realized my position fully couldnt let myself remain fugitive
Ive come back because Im not afraid of fac ing this charge
Im innocent Tell that McClane growled to the jury
They wont believe it any more than do Oakley turned
When you hear it McClane youll decide that Brenners alibi is one of the weakest you ever heard
Its so absolutely weak believed it im plicitly You what believe the man Oakley insisted
Hes not our murderer He left McClane staring incredulously and circled the room gazing at the floor
Bits of sawdust were sprinkled over it carried by the feet of the man who had cut the hole through the floor
Oakley paused outside closet door listened in tently and turned his back to it
Youre screwy McClane declared
This guy came here and tried to suffo cate us to death and you think maybe he was just having little fun Doctor Brenner faltered II stepped into this laboratory only moment ago
know nothing Aw nuts McClane snarled
Wait McClane Oakley interrupted
Doctor Brenner have question
Would you under any circumstances even if the deceased were very dear to you attempt at the present stage of your experiments to resurrect human being Certainly not the scientist exclaimed
Ive already told you why
The effect on the brain cells Its no good McClane Oakley de clared
He didnt do it Then who did The gentleman who was prevented from leaving this laboratory by Doctor Brenners entrance moment ago Oak ley answered
The gentleman hiding in this closet He whirled snatching at the knob of the door behind him flashing it open
In stantly swift movement came out
The heavy base of Bunsenbumer stand gripped by its upright slashed at Oak leys head
He ducked aside his up thrown arm numbed by the savage blow as dark figure leaped past
Grab him Archie Brixeys long frame dived at the man dashing toward the outer door
His lean arms encircled the mans waist
Oakley spinning again grabbed the burner stand and jerked it out of desperately clenched hand
He clicked hard knuckles to the point of lifted chin
groan sounded and Brixey found himself supporting sagging form
VAKLEY grabbed the captive slung him into chair whipped out an au tomatic and said Weve met Mr Sand well before believe Dime Detective Magazii Sidney Sandwell crouched gripping the chair glaring up at Oakley
So you didnt go after Brenner the investigator asked breathlessly
You were afraid of what we might learn here
Just as you were when you attempted to set fire to the place to destroy evidence and get us away
You stayed and watched you trapped us in the cellar and tried You cant prove that Sandwell gasped
On the contrary Oakley asserted while McClane stared and Brixey blocked the way to the door
Your fingers look burned
Actually theyre frostbitten by the dry ice you heaved down on us
You tracked sawdust from the ice packing into the closet when you hid He grabbed SandwelTs ankle swung the foot upward peeled down the trouser cuffand more bits of fresh sawdust sifted out
McClane said For Gods sake Oak ley Fill out the picture yourselfyoull get confession from him Oakley prom ised
Hell tell you that he saw Faith Lee die of heart attack
Hell tell you he made desperate attempt to revive her made it himself because he knew Doc tor Brenner would refuse to do it
Hed had medical training
Hes already ad mitted to me he saw the technique of resurrection demonstrated to him
Hell tell you he took the keys of this lab out of the doctors pocket while Bren ner was sleeping and later returned them
Hell tell you he marked the corpses of Anderson and Brooks in order to throw suspicion on Brenner
Hell Sandwell snarled wasnt even in town that night
was in YumaI tele phoned you from there
can prove it True Oakley admitted but you left for Yuma immediately after putting the two bodies in the trunks as part of plan to establish an alibi
You used me as tool toward that end
Its no use Sand wellyoure got Defiance flared in Sandwells eyesde fiance already fading before the inevita bility of established guilt
McClane fast ened heavy hands upon him and he winced
Oakley pocketed his automatic
queer thing McClane
Sandwells one dominating purpose at the beginning was quite the opposite of murderit was to bring dead body back to life
Why was he so desperate to do it
Because his living daughter meant big money to him his dead daughter meant poverty
leave him to you McClane blinked amazement
If theres another point still worrying you about Andersons car being in Miss Kents garage McClane Oakley added thats very simple
The murderer used it when he disposed of the bodies left it in the garage where it belonged and re turned to his own
He may deny it but thats the only way it could have hap pened you see because only Anderson and Brooks were witnesses to the episode of the attempted resurrection that night McClane gulped
guess so
That doesnt matter now anyway Smiling Oakley removed from his pocket yellow slip of paper and pushed it into Sandwells hands
That he said is the check you gave me He slipped folded document from McClanes coat pocket tore it to bits tossed them away
That he said is your warrant
McClane bid you good night
Come Cherry
Come Archie McClane gaped as they walked out
Oakley slid behind the wheel of his roadster
Brixey angled down at the far side and meditatively adjusted his mon ocle
Charmaine Morris nestled between them her arm curled through Oakleys
Cherry darling he sighed content edly make note to send Claire Kent bill for five thousand dollars in the morn ing RACE RACKET by Russ Meservey The greyhounds were whimpering in their kennels that afternoon for dog and his handler had died in the gamblers paradise that bordered the Flagler Track
Died fust in time to turn fiftygrand threerace wager into murder bet
ICK SLATES lean Florida tan nedface bore pleasant wistful smile
He placed his hand on the dog in the stall and spoke softly
Well Tinpan you gonna fetch that sharp nose of you first tonight
You gonna win for Mr Jackwall that gambler again The greyhound whimpered nuzzled the cagedoor wire with nose that was hot against Slates scrawny fingers
One of the Flagler Street track attendants came into the dog house with another hound
The dog was barking but the barking stopped became low whimper like Tin Dime Detective Magazine pans as they entered
As the door opened and shut Slate could see Harry Jackwalls well built figure hurrying away
Jackwall had been loitering outside when Slate had entered
Evenin Nick the redcoated attend ant called and put the greyhound in stall
Evenin Joe Slate answered
Say whats makin these hounds whine Joe
They act nervous an scared Youall quit that whimperin
Fly back Joe said to the dog and closed the stall gate locking it
Dont know Nick lest its storm cominup
That whimpers em sometimes He came along the line of stalls toward Slate looking into the cages
Pooches aint all in yet Nick
What time is He stopped three stalls from Nick Slate finished the it with sharply indrawn breath bent down quickly and cried in strangled voice Good God look
Look Nick Slate took two long strides stood crouched staring into the stall
The wist ful smile faded from his lean face
God Joe exclaimed
Hesdead Inside the wall stall jammed into the dogsized cage the twisted body of small man knelt head toward the door as though in prayer
The handle of knife hiltdeep between his narrow shoulders made brown bullseye in drying circle of red staining the faded denim shirt
Slate stopped shaking the door
He growled Who owns the dog thats sup posed to be in this stall Joe Number Seven Joe answered grimly
Fellow named Owen
Hes new owner from St Petersburg Slate got up from his crouched posi tion glanced keenly around the half gloom of the dog house
Charles Owen he said to Joe in low voice
saw his name on the board
Never raced at Miami before that know of but his hounds supposed to have record in the quarter mile
Fu Manchus the pups name Slate spoke as though reciting lesson he had learned but his eyes kept darting up and down the length of the building
TTHE dog stalls lined both sides of the house in two tiers
The dead man was in lower stall
The steel mesh over the door frames covered an area about two feet high and one foot wide and was too closely woven to permit hand being reached inside
The rest of the stalls were of solid wood with an automatic spring lock on each door
Get this Charley Owen Nick di rected tersely
And Richardson the track manager
Bring em here and cop too but dont talk to anybody else Joe
The first race starts in about fifty minutes an thisll have to be cleaned up before then or th dogs wont run
Tell Sam Wren to keep people out of here
Hold the pups outside
Nick Joe agreed quickly
The Flagler Street track detective studied the floor of the dog house near the death stall
There were no bloodstains
Either the dead man had been hit on the head and stabbed to death after he had been jammed into the dog stall or he had been murdered somewhere outside and carried in
There was no telling until his identity was discovered
Slate had no key to the locked stall
The greyhounds in the other stalls con tinued their whimpering
dog barked outside
Slate stood with his back against the door of Stall leaned there blocking view of the grisly sight behind him watching the entrance to the kennels
Another redcoated handler came in with white hound and behind him short fat man with reddish round face entered puffing
Joe says you wanted to see Mr Owen Nick the handler called
Ive got to park this pooch in here for the first race Race Racket Im Charley Owen the short fat man stated
Hows my dog He eyed Slate as he advanced
Youre not handler are you
guess you must be an owner
know dogs mister
Ive got fifteen of the fastest racers in Florida
Wait until you see my Fu Manchu run Im Nick Slate Slate said curtly
Track detective He made no move to move away from in front of Stall
Did you bring your dog in here yourself or did somebody else Hell no Owen scoffed with wide grin
Im no smalltimer
Ive got fifteen pooches Im telling you He looked around called Hey you
Wheren hells Ribs gone now
Damn it told him not to leave Fu alone
Not for minute
Slate asked Ever hear hounds whim per like these dogs are now Mr Owen dont worry about other peoples dogs the fat man said
He came close to Slate
Get away from that kennel door feller
Youre shutting air out from my racer
know some of those tricks myself
You cant fool me
And you dont hear Fu whimpering Nooo Slate agreed softly and step ped away from the stall door
Owen took keys from his pocket squat ted key poised in front of the lock of Stall
He said Now Fu with throaty chuckle
Now and went sud denly to his knees began swearing
All right Slate ordered
Unlock the door and well both see how dead he is Pivoting on his knees the fat man cried Youkilled him
By God
You His right hand dove into his hip pocket jerked out holding stubby automatic
You killed Ribs you Nick Slate kicked his right foot out and up
The toe of his shot hit Owens right wrist
The revolver exploded once
Its blast sounded like cannon
LATE took four steps along the stalls picked up the gun he had kicked out of Owens hand
He came back stood over the fat man
Youll scare hell out of the hounds Owen and get yourself in jam shooting guns off around here Owen got to his feet He was trem bling
His fat lips moved but for minute no words came from his mouth
His eyes were narrowed showing only brown irises and black pupils
Fingering the gun Slate said irritably Well you didnt use knife on me but it was knife that He ripped the keys from Owens left hand stooped unlocked the stall door swung it open
Reaching inside he touched the body felt cold bare slim forearm moved cold finger of thin hand not yet stiffened
He started to drag at the arm stopped backed away from the stall
Have to leave him in there until the cops move him he said
You called him Ribs
What was his name Jeff Ribbon Owen answered with an effort
Hes my trainer He was your trainer
Ribbon eh
Funny name The whining of the greyhounds kept up
The door at the end of the kennel opened
bulky policeman came in fol lowed by Joe and tall handsome man in light gray suit
IIm sorry lost my temper Owen said
It was shock Slate pocketed the stubby automatic and waited while the cop and Joe and Richard son the track manager walked up to them
He motioned into the dog stall said nothing
His eyes were on Richardson
The cop whistled as he bent down and looked inside the stall
When he stood up again his jaw was jutting
Call homicide at headquarters he ordered the attendant
And tell them to call the medical examiner
Ill have to stay here until they come He got out notebook Dime Detective Magazine began asking questions writing out his report
Joe went outside to phone
Joe and found him like you see him Slate explained grimly
Owen here might know something about it
figured youd want to know about it before it leaked out on the track Mister Richard son Richardson said Thats right sourly
Your trainer Owen Owen nodded started to speak but shut up as the cop glared at him
The policeman said Well hell
This aint going to be so swell for the track guess but it dont have to be made public yet What you think was the idea To keep my hounds from running Owen flared suddenly
Thats the idea if you want to know
By God
Wheres Fu Manchu
Wheres my greyhound was sort of waiting for you to get excited about that Slate said with slow drawl that veiled quickened interest
Yeah Owen retorted angrily again
You seem to know hell of lot about this yourself Guess youre right Owen Slate an swered
Guess aim to Youd better watch your step
Slate Richardson said
This is murder
Re member that
The homicide squad will handle it imagine without your help
You stick to watching out for pick pockets The cop eyed the three of them made another note in his book said nothing
Joe the attendant came back into the building
Homicidell be right over he announced
Id better get the dogs out of here before then Youd better leave Mr Owens Fu Manchu where you find him Joe Nick Slate suggested mildly
Youll find him in one of the stalls He walked along the double tier of ken nels blinking small flashlight into each one
Fu Manchu was stretched out in Stall dead from blow on the head
Owen followed him began cursing again at the sight
Richardson and the policeman stood back by the body of Rib bon
Joe was collecting muzzles and leashes from rack in one end of the building
How much was being bet on this dog Slate asked Owen
You dont have to tell me
dont have to tell about the gun took from you Owen hesitated stopped swearing eyed Slate speculatively
Well Slate asked
Fifty grand Owen said
pool in St Petersburg
Ten of us Nick Slate nodded slowly
His eyes seemed heavylidded
And now that your pooch wont run again he asked
We lose fifty grand Owen muttered
No scratches allowed in that bet
Thats why had Ribs stay with the dog all the You said you had fifteen dogs Slate reminded him
Why not run one of them now Charley Owen stepped close to Slate tapped him on the chest with pudgy forefinger
Thats part of the bet he said sourly
can switch any racer own for Fu and so can Jackwall and his crowd switch Jackwall dog for Tin pan
But the hell of it is Ive got noth ing absolutely nothing mister in the quarter mile heat thatll touch this Tinpan
Fu Manchu could and did take him
But havent got Fu now Slate lifted his shoulders and said Maybe you havent got fifty grand any more either
Id keep that bet secret while CK SLATES lanky figure idled un ostentatiously near the entrance to the entrance to the Flagler Track club house
Down along the stands and under them where the public made their bets milling crowd swarmed worming their way up to the betting booths and back again
But in the club house there was sense of quietness of sureness
It was here that the bigmoney bets were laidbets not on the board bets between owners and backers and dog fanciers
Back further along the stands where darkness was intensified under and around the lights near the dog house the homi cide squad was on the job
Owen had been questioned and allowed to go com paratively free about the track grounds
The dog handlers were being grilled for what little information they might have which was none at all
The murderer had entered the kennel done his grisly task and walked out again
So far as the police knew the killer might have been Joe or one of the other attendants or even Nick Slate himself
motive was lacking
Nobody had mentioned Jackwall being around
Slate watched the clubhouse windows until he was sure he recognized the stocky solid figure of Harry Jackwall inside the building
He ambled on up the steps went inside stood moment until Jackwall was alone
He called the gambler by name grinned wistfully at him
thought maybe Mr Jackwall Slate said that Id find chap named Charley Owen up here somewhere
He mentioned knowing you Hiya Slate Jackwall exclaimed jovially
Sure he knows me
just heard about little trouble or some thing down at the kennels
You should know something about that eh Homicide squads down there now Slate said in his drawling voice
Owens trainer got himself killed and his pooch Fu Manchu too
Most anybody working back there could have done the job guess or anybody racing dog tonight here could have gotten into the kennels
Ive got hunch the police wont work it out right Jackwalls joviality left him
Sternness sharpness came on his face like mask
He studied Slate long moment and asked You think should go down there and talk to the law
Slate Nick Slate shook his head
Thought might save you the walk Mr Jackwall
know Owen hasnt mentioned this to the cops yet and think he wontnot until he sees you anyhow
What Im sort of wondering is you goin to call off that fiftygrand bet with him Ahhh Jackwells breath came from between clamped teeth
No By God no It was fair bet
He took the same chances took
He won the first race
Suppose it had been Tinpan killed in stead of his Fu Manchu
Would renig
Would squawk Well guess you wouldnt squawk Slate said
guess maybe this Charley Owen wont squawk either
But its lot of dough He walked away ambled back outside the chib house
The first race was already starting with Fu Manchus name replaced on the board by dog called Ringo
The betting public was crowding the lower rail down in front of the stand and above the stand itself was almost filled
Slate idled over nearer the rail saw the swishing streak of the rabbit on the track as it went around the course to pick up the dogs
He stood watching until the greyhounds were sprung from their cages noted that Tinpan got away first held the lead easily
Slate had missed that race in the afternoon
Slate was less than halfway back to ward the dog house when the winner was named on the electric board on the judges standTinpan
voice over the public address system announced new track record
The band in the grandstand began to play
Dime Detective Magazine ROUND the comer of the kennels Joe the redcoated assistant ap peared with homicide detective
An other dog handler had taken his place while the police quizzed him again
He appeared calm as though he enjoyed the procedure the attention
Not getting much of anywhere Slate the detective from headquarters called quietly
Guess Ill have to talk with Owen again
Quicktempered bird that Owen guess he dont know much about it Slate answered
He went into the kennel building walked the length of it came back down along the stalls again
He paid no atten tion to the stall where the body of Owens dog handler had been found
Two cops lounged against the double tiers nodded to him curtly
He paused at the stall where he had found Fu Manchu dead
The lock on the stall door was as he had discovered it smashed
He examined it more carefully made sure it had been shattered in an attempt to shut the door not to get it open
The markings on the wood showed that
Outside the dogs from the first race were being led back by the reduniformed attendants but they were not being taken to the kennel
They were being turned over to their owners or owners trainers at side entrance to the track
Slate stood stock still suddenly in the shadow of the building
Two things came to him simultaneously the first thought the second tougher realization
The thought was that whoever had killed Jeff Ribbon had killed the dog Fu Manchu first and had been caught in the act and been obliged to kill Ribbon to cover up his identity
The way that stalldoor lock was broken proved that
The tougher realization was that some body was tailing him now
It was more than vague sense of being followed
It was real feeling
The inclination urging him to turn ab ruptly and face the farther gloomy wall of the track was overwhelming
He turned ducked heard the whish of an ob ject fly past his crouched shoulders saw the faint gleam of steel blade
Then the knife tucked its sharpness into the earth forty feet away near the rear wall of the kennel Slate shoved himself upright strode rapidly toward the rear fence
The bark ing yipping of greyhounds greeted him
Ten redcoated handlers and ten dogs were coming toward him from gate in the fence
There was nobody else in sight
It was impossible that one of the handlers could have thrown that knife without be ing detected by some of the others
As he turned he saw Jack wall moving off out of darkness into light toward the stands
Jackwall might have come from anywhere might have thrown the knife himself
Slate prowled until he found the knife after the handlers and dogs had passed
He saw it was little different from the knife that had killed Ribbonan ordinary fish knife longbladed sharp with jack knife handle
There were hundreds of such knives to be had on Miami Beach
He started back toward the grandstand saw Richardson the track manager walk ing ahead of him
Richardson saw him over his shouder waited for him
The managers face was grave his eyes darkly angry
You found out something Slate Richardson demanded
Something Slate admitted
Not much
found out the dog was killed first and Owens trainer afterwards Anything else Richardson insisted
saw Jackwall and he said you were talldng with himabout bet Thats right Slate agreed
About Race Racket bet
Fifty grands lot of dough to bet on two dogs in three races
Yup found that out too
And found fish knife somebody heaved at me
It wont prove anything except that some people heave fish knives at meand miss Listen Richardson said earnestly
Take this tip
Jackwall thinks you know too much
You watch Jackwall Slate
Watch himl Richardson turned abruptly strode off toward the dub house
fpHE fourth race was Daily Double event the first of the two Doubles of the evening
bet on the winning dog in both Doubles would pay somewhere between forty and ninety dollars depend ing up how the odds came out at the end
Slate idled up to Doubles betting window laid his money got his ticket
It was the only bet he made during the week and he had never won yet but he was persistent patient
Out of the comer of his eye he caught sight of the fat figure of Charley Owen watching the track morosely and not too far away was detective from homicide
Slate ambled over to the detective stood there beside him until he was sure Owen saw him and saw the detective also
The chief is havin all these guys that might know somethin come down to head quarters after the track closes the de tective said
got to tail this bird Owen until then but guess he dont know nothin about this case
Anyhow got to follow him and maybe you better come on down with the crowd Slate
Down to see the chief mean Well be around Herman Slate promised
The homicide detective faded away into the crowd headed for the nearest coffee andsandwich Stand under the grandstand
Nick Slate moved toward Charley Owen stood beside him saying nothing
was looking for Jackwall the fat dog owner said to Slate
He spoke as though only to make conversation but there was depth in his voice that held feeling
About that bet Slate asked
guess Im stuck for that Owen said soberly
No it was about somethng else
Maybe shouldnt tell you
might be wrong You were wrong once tonight Owen Slate touched his coat pocket significantly where the gun he had taken from Owen still made compact hard weight
Did you tell the law about the bet yet took your advice Owen replied evenly
didnt tell them Oh The moneys being held Owen said
Its in the clubhouse safe
dont have to pay him off
He can get it when he wants it after the last race
wanted to ask him something else something Rich ardson told me about few minutes ago Well Slate asked
just want to tell Jackwall Owen said that he wins his gamble in money but he dont want to make any passes at me He shouldnt do that now Slate drawled
Youve had trouble enough for one night Owen
You lost fine dog and trainer and all that money that you and your friends put up He squinted down at the fat man studied him from beneath veiled idleappearing somber lids
Im not hunting trouble Owen stated flatly
know Ive got temper that gets away from me sometimes
But think Id better go see Jackwall just to let him know Owen started to walk off but Slate put hand on his arm
just thought of it Mr Owen
Maybe Id better go in and ask Jackwall to come out and talk with you
Somewhere in back so the law wont Dime Detective Magazine be botherin Jackwallseein yon talk to him By God Owen cried
You seem to be pretty damned interested in protecting that gambler Its not that Mr Owen
Its more like this if you understand me
Bein sort of private detective on the track here my job is sort of to help people not to hinder them
They come here to gamble on the dogs and thats the tracks busi ness
The track hires me so my job is to see that people can gamble here with out being bothered too much He looked sleepily at Owen nodded and walked toward the club house
The band was playing again and the lights were off around the track proper pre paratory to the fanfare of the next race As he turned up the clubhouse steps he saw over his shoulder that Owen was following him slowly hesitantly and that Herman the homicide detective was no where in sight
TVHERE were several groups of people sitting on the clubhouse porch now waiting for the seventh race to flash up men and women in natty light clothes talking laughing
He found Jackwall sitting on the porch railing talking with Richardson on far end of the porch
The two men were talking quietly yet there was an atmosphere of tenseness about them
Slate went straight to them and said to Jackwall That fellow we were talkin about while back Mr Jackwall hed like to see you out back in private right away flash of understanding passed be tween the gambler and the track manager but Slate pretended to miss it
Ill talk with him all right Jackwall growled and got up
Without excusing himself to Richard son he strode away stolid healthy bulk of man with broad snoulders hunched forward as though about to strike
Hes pretty damned mad Richardson said to Slate
Mad and scared
Id say
Yes sir
Jackwalls afraid Owen will holler out loud about that bet and the law will jump on that as motive for killing Owens dog and Owens trainer You think Jackwall did the killing Hell no Richardson exclaimed eagerly
Hes gambler Jackwall is
Hed take the loss if he lost and shut up
Id hate to say he was the killer Slate
Didnt you tell me that whoever killed that trainer killed the dog first Sure Slate agreed
Somebody killed the dog and got caught in the act by this fellow Ribbon and had to kill Rib bon to protect himself
dont believe the cops will catch up with him Mr Richardson but Ive got hunch the murderer has already given himself away
think Ill probably catch him myself sure hope you do Slate Richard son said
And if were you Id take sneak out back and see what those two are up to
One murder on this track is about all we can stand Thats something was sort of plan nin on doin right now Slate said and nodding gloomily moved off through the club house
He went out the back way down the steps into almost complete darkness
The building was near high wall of the tracks outside fence and the lights from the rear windows gave little glow into the gloom beyond
Slate stood near the bottom of the steps moment then moved further away from them listening
He heard Jackwalls voice and Owens
They were talking in low tones angrily but not loud enough so he could hear their words distinctly
In the near distance the band stopped playing
He edged closer to the two men keeping in black shadow himself trying hard to see the positions Race Racket of the two
Then Jackwall said dearly said Id break you and will
If you think Something hard blunt crashed against Nick Slates head
Fire flamed seethed an instant in his brain
His last thought as he fell was of speedthe speed with which he had been attacked
CLATES consdousness returned to him in series of splitting throbs
He moved his hands felt of his head
His hat had fallen off and there was splotch of blood where he touched his hair
He was positive that either Jackwall or Owen could have sneaked up behind him and knocked him out
He got to his feet moving slowly get ting his bearings
As he stood there his feet crunched on glass
At first he paid no attention to it
Then the sensation gnawed at him
He stooped found sev eral pieces on the ground fdt them for thickness
Window glass Perplexity and annoyance made lines on his tanned features
He stood still listening heard the beginning of band music out across the Flagler Street track
But he could not hear voices
Moving ahead through the darkness he saw that Jackwall and Qwen were gone
sudden glow of lights from in front of the club house lightened the darkness as the track lights went on for the start of another race
Nick Slate retraced his steps went back into the club house by the rear door
He stood at the sink in the small kitchen bathed his head brushed cold water over his face and eyes
waiter came into the kitchen eyed him curiously went out again carrying tray of bottles
When the waiter had gone
Slate step ped to the rear window in the kitchen examined it then went to the next win dow
Both were intact locked and their glass was unbroken
He opened one found it moved up without noise
Look ing down he noted that the distance to mans head beneath the window was within arms reach about the right height for blow
He shut the window locked it studied moment and went along the rear wall of the kitchen into pantry
There was one window here locked also but near the lock on the middle sill there was an arc of glass missing that left hole large enough for hand to reach in and un fasten the lock
drawn grim smile began to play over Slates features
He went back into the kitchen down the rear steps along the rear wall of the club house groping his way in the gloomy recess between the racetrack wall and the wall of the building
What he was searching for was not there but he found good substitute for ita solid and fairly large packing box
The box was not under the window but it was close enough so that it could be moved beneath the pantry window with out much trouble
There was wary satisfaction on Slates face as he strode round the clubhouse building to the front
He did not go inside again but ambled into the crowd that still lingered for the last race of the night
He went once more to the Doubles window asked who had won found that he had lost again
He shrugged grinned goodnaturedly strode away toward the dog house
FHE two homicide detectives still leaned against the stalls when he went inside
It was as though they had not moved but there were number of ciga rette butts scattered over the floor around them
Anything new come up he asked
Nothing one of them said
Dime Detective Magazine They got this Owen fellow Slate demanded
Hes been sittm over at the club house waiting
He sort of got over bein mad at us for askin questions
Hes gettin wise Who else is going down to head quarters Slate asked
Most of the track attendants who handle these pooches
The chief hes hellion on details
He says to us we get enough details and hell solve any crime that comes along So this time hes going to make try at gettin the details himself the other detective from homicide explained
All we got to do is stand round and sit round but bet we dont make no pinch unless its this bird Owen Ill try and be there myself Slate said
Youd better
The chiefll want to hear what you got to say about these attend ants with them red monkey suits Richardson the track manager hires them Slate said
Hed be the one the chief should ask about them Hell be there too Slate the second dick said
Hes going to drive down himself so heard him say
Hes got to close up the joint first hasnt he Either Richardson or Riley his assist ant or me Slate told them
Ill be seeing you Yeah but Id rather go home and fall into the hay myself Slate said So would and went back outside
He stayed in the lighted area this time went down to the rail watched the last race come in
The two lead dogs coming down the stretch nose and nose lost their tempers and began fighting
The entire pack smashed past them over the line leaving them still fighting as their two attendants ran down to part them
The crowd howled and some of them swore
There was surge toward the paying booths under the stands
The lights went out around the track as the dogs were led away
Outside the track fence the rumble of cars replaced the usual sound of the band
More lights began blinking out around the track
Slate stood at the rail watching the people move past out through the gate beyond
He turned when Richardson called to him
The track manager was coming along from the club house which was alreadydark
You stick round Slate Richardson directed
Lock up for me
Ive got to go down to police headquarters
When you finish you can come on down your self if you want to find out whats going on
Or maybe you know already Not much more than did while ago Slate replied
Sure Ill lock up
You locked the club house didnt you Riley did Slate said
See you later The track manager walked away went out the gate
Nick Slate still stood there by the rail
He saw Herman and Owen come from under the stand and go out after Rich ardson
few moments later another detective came along stopped
Going down to see the show at head quarters die detective asked
Itll be just routine grilling guess
This is hell of murder case
Its too damned open
Wide open
You coming Later maybe Slate answered
After close up all around The stolid figure of the detective went through the gate disappeared
The two gatemen and the ticket sellers waved and went out
The betting booths were dark gaps in blackness under the main stand
Slate came away from the track rail abruptly started off at brisk walk to ward the dog house
His manner changed completely
The slow wistful gangling movement of features and body became hard tighdy drawn
His eyes smoldered
Race Racket He took flashlight from his pocket blinked it on the dog house went past to the rear fence gate saw it was locked
He made complete rapid circuit of the outer track wall came back to the main stand again slid silently invisibly into the darkness
TjXDR fully five minutes Slate stood in the blackness under the stand listen ing but no sound reached his ears save the rumble of earn outside on the street the occasional lilt of voices as people passed
He was alone in the trackalone so far as he knew
But there had been dead dog and dead man that night and there had been fish knife heaved at him in the darkness earlier while thousand people stood within hailing distance
Nick Slate like shadow began to slide noiselessly toward the club house He went between the wall of the track and the club building hugged the track wall where the lights from the street and buildings outside did not reach him
He held the flash in his left hand his own gun in his right
The gun he had taken from Charley Owen still made weight in his coat pocket
There was long moment as he moved forward when he could see absolutely nothing
Then vaguely he discerned the lack of something that he had seen there earlier
Steadying his eyes he strained into the blackness
His head nodded slowly methodically like man who has made chess move that he has figured out well in advance and which satisfies him
The box he had spotted had been moved
It was directly beneath the pantry window and the window was open from the bottom wide enough for man to enter with comparative ease
sense of disaster began to gnaw at Slate as he stood there in darkness sense of futility
It was one thing to track criminal to wait outside for him to come out
It was another thing to go in after him singlehanded
But there was that front door and side door besides that could be opened from within
There was not much chance of anyone entering by window and emerging by the same route with two doors offering quick easy exit
Yet there was reason too
There was Slate himself Once more that hard grin came upon his features
He moved over to the box pocketed his flash but held his gun ready as he climbed up
He balanced himself tried to hear sounds that could not be heard then swung leg over the window sill swung his body inside stood on the pantry floor
The pantry door was shut
He pushed it open gently slowly stepped into the small kitchen of the club house
Moving to the center of the kitchen he stood silent straining ears and eyes
slow methodical drip drip drip of water from faucet was the only sound
He orient ated himself found the kitchen swing door leading into the front part of the building
He went through it into large room that he knew was laid out with tables and chairs and settees
Standing quietly poised on the balls of his feet he heard for the first time muffled sound that was like heavy ham mering on metal in confined closed space
The sound kept up with the per sistence of the dripping water in the kitchen
Slate moved toward the noise realized as he moved that he was headed for the clubhouse office the office used by Rich ardson and Riley the room where the larger bets were laid on the dogs
The pounding stopped abruptly started again louder then stopped entirely with resounding thud and something that wa like an echo of the thud
Dime Detective Magazine Slate started forward quickly jerked out his torch
His body hit chair careened off it as he tried to steady him self
He swung against table tried to catch his balance by putting hand oa it
The table tipped went over crashed to the floor
With curse
Slate sprang aside flicked on his electric flash tried to aim it at the office door
TTE found tlje wall with the light then JL the door panel
His senses warned him that the door was already opening
flash of fire burst from the doorway before he could spring aside
The flash light in his left hand shattered and his hand felt numb and sticky
second explosion blasted from the doorway and slug plowed through the flesh of his left leg above the knee
Slate staggered
His own gun jerked in his rght hand the muzzle streaking out jet of fire
He shot again and tripped over chair
body hurtled through the blackness hot breath panted against his face and fist hammered against his mouth loos ened teeth drew blood that tasted warm salty
He swung his gun again missed completely
And as suddenly as the attack had started it ended
The fingers jerked away from his throat
The body on top of him leaped off crashed against furniture
The sounds started to die away
Nick Slate swore shook himself into renewed activity
He struggled to his feet wobbled moment plunged after the retreating sounds his arms flaying tables and chairs aside as he ran
The kitchen door slammed back into his face as he lunged at it in the darkness
He bounced away swung up his gun fired and kicked the door wide open
There was no answering fire
He plunged through the doorway swung to ward the pantry heard bang realized the pantry door had opened and ckraed
He handled dove at it His shoulder burst it open the wrong way sent it splintering down off its hinges
He went to his knees saw vague figure dropping off the window sill to the ground outside
Slate threw up his gun but the target had disappeared
He roared at the figure scrambled to his feet went through the window taking the sash with him
He missed the box under the window completely went over it and felt shat tered glass and broken splinters dig into his hands and knees as he landed
He leaped to his feet whirled staring about him
The figure was rounding the corner of the club house
faint glow of light out lined it from higher building over the track fence
Slate fired his gun as he ran
The figure stumbled turned fired back at him then ran on
Somewhere outside police whistle shrilled three times was followed by an answering whistle further off
The figure hit the shadow of the fence whirled crouched
Flame burst from the mans gun
The slug creased Slaters head
Slate dropped to one knee took aim saw the figure suddenly leap up into the air clutch at the top of the fence
The gun jerked in Slates hand again
He saw the figure erk as though in response heard muffled curse
Then the man had his leg over the fence top was pawing his way over
Nick Slate swore lunged up and for ward
He forgot the gun in his hand as he ran
Then he was in the air diving upward his arms stretched ahead of him
The figure halfway over the fence kicked out at him
The shoe caught Slate square in the face made stars against blackness in his head
His arms encircled the mans leg elung there as Slates body Race Racket swung down dragging hauling the figure back off the fence
The man fired once more as he fell
The bullet slugged along Slates back seared his flesh thudded into the ground
Then the two men were down pawing kicking slugging with fists and guns
GLATE twisted heaved rolled got on top
His fist hammered into the mans belly hammered again
The figure swung up at the torso spat blood coughed flopped back again
Slate crashed his fist into the stomach again sprang to his feet jerked the man upright
voice bellowed on the other side of the track fence near them and another voice joined the first
Come over the fence Slate shouted
Bring light But even as he called peculiar ex pression came over his bloody features
His eyes gleamed and once again there was satisfaction in his eyes
He shook the man in his grip
Richardson he muttered
Richardson damn you snap out of it Slate put his hands in the track man agers pocket went through his clothes and his fists came out holding two thick wads of bills bound with heavy rubber bands
torch blinked at them from the fence top then swung down as the cop jumped to the ground
What th hells goin on here he demanded
Its pinch Slate growled at them
Thats all it is pinch He glanced over his shoulder blinked into the light held on him and demanded belligerently Go get an ambulance one of you and call police headquarters
Tell em Damn Richardson said suddenly
Ill tell em myself Sure the cop said
Take it easy there guy The second cop ran down the track toward the phone booths under the grand stand
Slate said to the cop with them You
Get out that book of yours and write it down
This birdll sign it
Its confession The cop fumbled inside his coat pro duced notebook pencil
Slate said as though reciting but with tired inflection wanted the hundred grand Charley Owen and Harry Jack wall gave me to hold for them as bet money on three races between OwenS Fu Man chu and Jackwalls Tinpan
tried to stall off the races by killing Owens dog to give me time to get the money out tonight before the bet was over
Owens trainer caught me and had to kill him
His name was Jeff Ribbon The cop scribbled moment said Yup
Go on with it got afraid of Nick Slate and tried to scare him off
threw knife at him but he wouldnt scare
set Owen and Jackwall against each other so they would get into fight and get arrested
That was to give me more time to steal their money
knocked Slate out at the same time so could fix up the clubhouse window for an entrance
opened the safe after sneaked back here through the dog gate took the money and knocked the knob off the safe to make it look like an ordinary robbery Slate said when the cop had finished writing that Now Richardson you snap out of it long enough to sign this state ment or Ill break you into plenty of pieces
Sign it Richardson blinked coughed signed his name
And you Slate said to the cop put down there somewhere how this confes sion is of his own free will and accord or whatever it is The cop said Geez guy and wrote it out
The Seventh Cedar Seven Cedars was the name over the gateway to that house of horror yet only she gaunt evergreens stood on the lawn
Dinner for seven at seven oclock the host had indicated
Yet only six sat down at table
What was the sinister meaning of the mis sing sevens
What ghastly joke was Septimus Cedara seventh son playing on that sextet of lost souls
Do you remember she challenged weaving there in the gloom
by Allan Vaughan Elston Author of Star Witness etc
CHAPTER ONE Port of Missing Brides EYOND the arched gate lawn sloped up in steep green sweep to the house
It was tall eaveless structure noted shuttered and severely colonial
Midway on its lawn six cedar trees were growing in row
They were about ten paces apart and obviously had been planted
Six of these cedars there were no more no less
Dime Detective Magazine Why six
Seven Cedars was the name boldly inscribed over the gate
And recalled that the stationery of my client Captain John Temple which bore the message summoning me to this North Jersey coun try estate was likewise engraved Seven Cedars
Yet the number of cedars was definite six
Wheremy mind instantly and inev itably inquiredwas the seventh cedar
After driving through die arched gate and circling the lawn parked in court to the left of the house
was but minute or so late Temple having asked me to call at six oclock
At my knock the door of the house was opened by bald old bullethead who im mediately struck me as an Orientaland tough one
His thin leatherbrown face was seamed and pitted
scar the full width of his forehead was deep and frightful
battered old customer from somewhere east of Arabia decided probably Hindu
PHE fellow backed away from me bowing awkwardly with which crab like progress he lured me into gunroom on the right of the hall
There found Captain Temple in the company of young collegian in creamy flannels
This younger man was pacing the floor with such morbid preoccupation that he did not notice my entrance
Here you are Conroy
Good John Temple stocky and solid prematurely gray greeted me with his hardfisted grip
Bud meet my attorney Conroy
Con roy this is Bud Arkles Young Arkles relaxed long enough to shake hands
Look sharp Rokh Temple then said to his EastIndian servant
And remem ber youre to serve dinner for seven promptly at seven Rokh backed from the room
As my eyes followed him became more and more convinced that the fellow should have been stevedoring around Singapore rather than butlering in New Jersey
Once he was gone Temple was all busi ness
He looked at his watch snapped it shut with dick and said Theres deal to tell you in less than an hour Con roy
Will you sit down You want legal advice presume queried taking chair
Nothing like that he said
just want you as witness to showdown due during the evening at this house Naturally was bewildered
show down on what issue An affair of mystery Conroy
And if Ive tagged him rightly the villain of the piece will dine with us at seven And my role will be Merely to size him up Temple said
Keep your eyes open and your reason pliable
Youre supposed to have judi cial mind so want your reactions Cant we be getting along com plained young Arkles
He jerked fret fully toward us again plowing hand through his shock of reddish hair
Weve less than an hour you know Right
Briefly heres the situation Conroy From now on Temples voice drove like the piston of an engine
Three years ago one Septimus Cedar seventh son was honeymooning in the South Seas
His bride was approached on the dark deck one night by Lascar sailor who whispered to her warning
The lady though startled was incredulous
She refused to believe the terrible crimes which the whispering lascar imputed to her husband Septimus Cedar
Seeing that his warning was in vain the lascar begged her not to speak of it And did she asked
She did not
Otherwise she would have brought her husbands wrath heavily on the mans head The Seventh Cedar Just what warning did the Lascar whisper inquired to the bride of Septimus Cedar For the last minute had been staring thoughtfully out window regarding those evenly spaced six cedars
And still pondering on that misnomer over the arched gateway Seven Cedars
Then saw that my host and client John Temple was pulling bell cord
In response the bald old bullethead of an East Indian came sidling into the room
Rokh Temple said to him the gen tleman would like to know just what words of warning you spoke on dark deck in the South Seas to the bride of Septimus Cedar TEVELATIQN that it was Rokh who had passed that warning shocked me
Yet hadnt missed his pedigree far after all
Instead of Singapore stevedore the man was Lascar sailor
He answered bluntly in surprisingly glib English say to lady You are bis fifth when he tires of you he will push you into deep pit
It was so with the others Did the lady believe you prompted Temple
She do not believe me master What became of her Rokh Her maid she tell me the lady be downstairs right away master That quite staggered me
You mean to say gasped that Let the lady speak for herself Tem ple cut in
Come Temple led us out of the gunroom and across the hall to spacious library
We had been there barely minute when slim and pretty woman in her upper thirties judged joined us
She was brunette of grace and charm and liked her at once
It was plain that Temple did too
Ah here you are Alicia He moved quickly almost eagerly to her and took both her hands
In the next short second of time glimpsed new Temple
His irongray grimness was for that instant swept away
He was like courtier ardent greeting his lady love
Yet when he turned about he was again his old stony self
Alicia this is Mr Conroy my attorney
Conroy this is Miss Carterall Cant we skip the formalities and be getting along wth it came impatiently from Bud Arkles
And suddenly real ized how nervously impatient they all were
was myself
Most of all was this Slim dark lady whose fingertips were now touching my own
Those fingers were icy
Her poise was too rigid to be natural
knew that she was laboring under some grave tension
He is right
Let us be getting on with it Mr Conroy she said
Know then that although have chosen to assume my maiden name actually am the di vorced wife of Septimus Cedar That forthrightness helped to collect my wits
To collect them further tried to imagine that she was witness in court and the interviewing attorney
You were cruising with your husband some three years ago were you asked
Yes she said
And did Lascar sailor warn you as follows You are his fifth when he tires of you he will push you into deep pit
It was so with the others Yes Mr Conroy Temple was placing chair for her
She sat on the edge of it not at all rest fully
She was not dressed for dinner party
Temple in fact had mentioned that two of the guests would walk directly here from nearby golf course
now asked What of importance fol lowed the incident of the warning Miss Carterall little while later she said we ioe Dime Detective Magazii went ashore on an island
was walking with my husband in the moonlight up jungle path toward cliff overlooking the sea
Suddenly the dark mouth of pit loomed directly in front of me
felt Mr Cedars grip tighten on my arm
His face was changed
It was terrible
knew that the warning was truethat he meant to push me into that pit TTER voice raised as she said that end ing in note of almost wild hysteria
could see now the scars of pain in her eyes and faint dark circles beneath them
One knew at once that trail of tragedy lay behind her
Young Arkles all this while was standing by fretting fuming
Since he was barely more than callow collegian couldnt quite see where he figured
As for Temple he was standing at Alicias elbow like stocky Gibralter his knotty fists clenched
And so what did you do managed to inquire
was terrified she said
broke away and ran into the jungle
He came after me shouting
ran frantically on through the dark He never caught you He did not thank God This answer came fervently from John Temple
Temple himself resumed the testimony
week later he told me she was picked up by tramp freighter calling in to trade with natives at far end of that same island
Its small island by the way until recently uncharted somewhere between the Fijis and the Tongas Hit the high spots wont you begged Arkles
Its half past six myself Temple said was super numerary on the tramp
Alicia had suf fered frightful exposure had endured fever was at times delirious
made it my business to take her to hospital in Honolulu
Later as she convalesced there she told me what she has now told you And what did you do set out to find Septimus Cedar raging storm was hidden within the calm with which Captain Temple spoke
You went first suggested to the place she last saw him Yes
And found the pit
It was good hundred feet deep
Anyone pushed into it would surely be killed
But had my self lowered on rope to its bottom didnt want to ask the next question
Thinking of it made cold spot form at the base of my spine
Nothing was there Temple offered to my immeasurable relief
Yet for that there was an obvious reason
tunnel of sorts led from the bottom of the pit and broke into daylight at the base of marine cliff
The tunnel was merely wavewashed crevice through the faulty rock
At every high tide the sea surged through it although at low tide the bot tom of the pit was dry His point was clear enough
high tide swirling into the pits bottom twice day would receding tend to suck all light objects such as shells and bones with it
Weeks and months of such hy draulic action would swab the pit clean
By what excuse questioned did Septimus Cedar in turn with each of five wives visit the island He had bamboo bungalow at the place Temple said
He kept care taker there an old clubfooted derelict by the name of Hargis What became of Hargis myself found the body of Hargis abed in the bamboo bungalow
The indi cations led me to believe that he had died of fever And Cedar Was last seen in those parts by Rokh Captain Temple clapped his hands vigor ously
In moment Rokh appeared
Hot on the trail of the mystery The Seventh Cedar Temple explained soon found Rokh
His testimony struck me as sincere and it matches Alicias
Come Rokhgive ft to Mr Conroy as briefly as possible have the only seagoing launch at Palika Rokh said
His response came so quickly that it might have been re hearsed
Where wanted to know is Pali ka Whats the difference Bud Arkles complained
If you must know Palika is village on an island separated by about tenhour deepwater cruise from Cedars bungalow
Get along Rokh TkOKH continued
Four times Mr Ce dar he charter my launch to go with very new wife to this very pretty island
He have very nice bungalow there
Each time we get there he tell me go back to Palika
He say maybe he live there little while with new wife
Always next time see him at Palika he have another new wife
Five plenty nice wives he take to this very pretty island Naturally you got suspicious eh Rokh Temple prompted
So when you beached him there with his fourth bride you did bit of spying
Instead of heading out to sea on your return trip to Palika you prowled up through the jungle to see what you could see Rokh nodded his bald brown head vig orously
And what did you see see Mr Cedar push wife into pit So what did you do then put to sea for Palika You reported the murder there asked severely
When Rokh shook his head Temple came quickly to his rescue
Theres no police force at Palika he said
Then he tried to make me understand that Rokh had lived too long amongst savages to concern himself with the uxori cides of Nordic
And what man did with his own property wife by the East ern code being mans property was not vitally Rokhs business
He was however convinced that the same fate had befallen the other three wives of Septimus Cedar
He knew that he had taxied them all to the island and never seen them again
New was able to find anyone who ever saw them again Temple said
put in year at it Are you sure they ever existed was eying the Lascar suspiciously
Quite sure of it Temple said
Many of the Palika natives saw Septimus Cedar on each of the five occasions when he embarked from there with wife Gravely and sympathetically faced Alicia Carterall Cedar
She was staring straight ahead her face pallid from the shock of these recollections
John Tem ple stood with brawny hand on her shoulder
Dinner for seven at seven oclock Temple had said
We here in the room were only four
Three more there fore were due
turned brusquely toward Rokh
So while you werent setting the law on this man Cedar you did summon up enough human decency to warn his fifth wife
Later she escaped the clutches of Cedar and was rescued by your present master
In the meantime after his vain pursuit of his wife what did Septimus Cedar do He bring his baggage down to the beach and say we go back to Palika
We go back to Palika
On the way there he knock me overboard with capstan bar and go on alone Temple nodded confirmation
Palika fishermen picked Rokh up half drowned
His launch was found beached just around headland from Palika
Cedar disappeared bag and baggage
He was never seenuntil Alicia and spotted him not long ago in New York You were living in New York then asked
Dime Detective Magazine Yes
hadnt bought this country place then
In fact bought it for the sole reason that the man we think is Septimus Cedar lives directly across the road fjPHAT left me gasping
Yet in one illuminating flash saw Temples strategy
He was challenging Cedar
Every time the man fared forth from his house he must see this onewith its bold suggestion of missing seventh cedar
had six mature cedars planted by forester Temple explained
That thought would at least get rise out of him You mean that he denies hes Septi mus Cedar Stoutly
That is rang up his house from pay station and asked for Septi mus Cedar
This is the house of Leonard Landren the man himself answered
No such person as Septimus Cedar has ever been here Are you sure its the same man Alicia is sure of it
He hasnt seen her yet but shes managed to see him many times
Having been his wife she should be competent to identify him What about Rokh Rokh also positively identifies Lan dren as Cedar Temple said
Have you accused the man asked
Temple shook his head
In court or out of it he said he would simply deny he is Cedar
Then the case against him would fall flat And even if identified thought the case against Cedar would be weak
His assault on Alicia was not committed but merely contemplated
His alleged mur ders of the first three wives were not witnessed
As to the fourth the only witness was Rokh
Rokh would make none too convincing witness
Aside from all that was the matter of jurisdic tion
New Jersey courts were not con cerned with South Sea murders
Temple admitted all that
Alicia wanted to leave the entire busines alone he said
In fact she insisted on it until new development forced us to act And that inquired
Is that Septimus Cedar is about to take to himself sixth bride Temple an nounced gravely
Shes local girl just out of school and sowell we just cant let it happen Ill say we wont Bud Arkles barked savagely whacking fist into his other palm
Ill see him in hell first damn him At last was able to catalogue Arkles
The boy was of course either kinsman or close friend of the sixth bridetobe
When bluntly asked him which the question confused him
Temple answered quickly for him
close friend Con roy
They went to school together So then knew that Arkles was dis appointed sweetheart
neighborhood romance no doubt with its bud just ripen ing when along had come the dashing and muchmarried Septimus Cedar to spoil everything
You can see my own position Con roy Temple said
could hardly go to the girl or her parents with my evi dence in its present form saw that clearly
Yet Alicia is determined to save this young girl
Eve Marland from tying up with Cedar
The man is twice the girls age but he fascinates her
Since he would deny the identity it would do no good merely to warn the girl
So Alicia sug gested that we frighten him away
tried that with row of six cedars and misnomer on the gate but it produced no results So next confided in Bud Arkles
So we plotted to meet Landren and Miss Mar The Seventh Cedar land as though by accident on golf course
There Bud introduced me as friend
cultivated the acquaintance until it was mature enough to warrant inviting them to dinner Except for the contradiction of six Cedars and the name over your gate has the man any reason to suspect you as challenger
None at all
have kept Rokh out of sight
And Alicia with her maid only arrived this afternoon Just then the mantel clock struck seven
Theyre due now Temple said
Fve invited them for dinner tonight Septimus Cedar and his sixth asked
Then heard the front door ringing eerily through the house
There they are John Temple said grimly
Try to compose yourself Alicia
Rokh show them in CHAPTER TWO Dinner for Seven TOKH went to confront the man who unless we were absurdly astray he had last encountered on the occasion of being batted overboard with capstan bar
And here among us Alicia Carterall sat waiting with such strained tension that we were all bound to share it
Sep timus Cedar we knew did not expect to see her here
Nor had he seen her at all since she had broken away from him at the death pit
moved to the hall arch spying past the drapes there
wanted look at the fellows face at the first instant of his contact with Rokh
If guilty surely such startling encounter would surprise him into making some move or exclamation which would give himself away
When it distinctly failed to do so was almost ready to drop the case against Leonard Landren
He looked Rokh straight in the eyes without even flush
Well here we are Eve he said easily to the pretty young girl who entered with him
With nonchalance not overdone he tossed his golf cap to the lascar and said Were Miss Marland and Mr Landren
And not late hope As Rokh came backing toward my por tieres they followed him
got out of the way just in time
Then took post from which could size up the man at his first sight of Alicia
She saw was braced as for blinding shock
She was seated directly in front of and facing the hall arch
The caller was bound to see her first of all when he entered the room
He did see her
But again he failed to flush
He permitted his eyes to rest upon her for moment impersonally then quite calmly at ease he looked about for Temple
Hello Buddy
And how do you do Mr Temple Those greetings came from Eve Marland
This girl seemed even younger than had been led to believe
Temple making the best of it intro duced them to Alkia Carterall
Then he presented me
In Alicia Landren seemed to take no more interest than is the due of any pretty woman
single glance at Landren and one could understand why the girl had found him attractive
He was not only finely built and handsome but he had the way of man who has been everywhere and knows everything
One of my guests heard John Temple say has not arrived
We shall not however wait long Landren dropped easily into chair beside Alicia
You live hereabouts Miss Carterall He faced her smiling pleasantly
Which showed thought that he could not pos sibly be the rogue we wanted
After push ing four wives into pit surely no human could thus face fifth who had escaped him
In this encounter it was the woman Dime Detective Magazine who was agitated
No live in New York she said and looked so upset that went to her rescue
Youre an old settler here in Sussex County are you Mr Landren Landren laughed
Not never set tle long in one spot
Been here though nearly year
Rather like it WENT out into the hall and found Rokh
See here said
Is that the fellow you knew in the South Seas as Septimus Cedar He are the man Rokh said
He hit me here knock me off boat Returning to the library found Eve and Arkles still paired while Landren was engaged by some question of Tem ples
That gave me chance for whis pered aside with Alicia
Is he Septimus Cedar asked
She nodded quickly
am positive We were presumed waiting for the seventh guest
half dozen times be tween seven oclock and seven thirty John Temple looked at his watch and frowned
Who kept wondering was this person for whom we waited
At seven thirty Temple said to Rokh Ring him up Rokh and find out if hes coming The lascar went out
He returned in about three minutes and reported that he had been unable to call the belated guest because the telephone was out of order
Well wait no longer Temple said
He offered an arm to Eve Marland
Without batting an eye Leonard Landren offered his to Alicia who by the record of testimony had been his fifth wife
She was game enough to take it though plainly she loathed the man
Temple and Eve Marland led the way into the hall followed by Landren and Alicia
The leftovers Arkles and myself went next while Rokh brought up the rear
In the dining room we found table set for seven
There was no light other than candles aligned from end to end of the table
Each candle stick noted was shaped like the bole of tree and had the look and smell of red cedar
There were seven of these candlesyet only six of them were lighted
No apology was made for the unlighted candle
There it was we could make of it what we would
John Temple took the head of the table placing Eve at his left and Alicia at his right was directed to the far end
Landren was placed next to Alida
His position was such that the unlighted candle stood squarely before him
On the other side of the table places were set for three
Two of these posi tions were occupied by Eve Marland and Bud Arkles
They did not sit next to each other though
Between them was an empty chairthe place presumably of the unarrived guest
This vacant seat was directly across from Landren with the unlighted candle directly between
An odd arrangement surely yet polite guest could hardly question it Nor did Temple refer to it
All the while knew he was posing an insidious challenge be fore Landren
ANDREN bafflingly composed di rected lively chatter at Alicia
He drew from her barely more than one word responses while Eve had no better luck with Arkles
Buddys feeling lowspirited Eve said across the table
Tell him funny story Leonard and cheer him up Landren knew funny stories and how to tell them
He took ready command of the conversation through three courses served awkwardly by Rokh
The lascar when not engaged took post directly back of the empty chair
There he would stand with his bald bullet head inclined forward and his eyes fixed in baleful stare at Landren
Occasion The Seventh Cedar ally he touched the deep scar on his fore head
And Landren faced it with no visi ble disconcertion
With apparently per fect innocence he faced the unlighted can dle the empty chair and Rokh
Nor did the presence of Alicia at his side in any way upset the mans aplomb
was aroused to envy at the way in which he served her pretty compliments
There was false note somewhere though
And at last placed it
It was that Landren was too composed
He was ignoring the evident tension of Alicia
An innocent man decided would note that he would perhaps make some com ment on it or at least he would permit it to guide the flow of his chatter
Eve by now had noticed it
She knew something was afoot was looking askance now and then from one to an other of us
And that realized was natural reaction of innocence
Innocence would feel the tension in the air and be subdued by it
It subdued Eve Marland
Yet Landren quite ignored it
Suddenly knew that Landren was guilty as Satan himself
He was Septi mus Cedar as Alicia said
Rokh was staring steadily at him now across the empty chair and the unlighted candle
Which reminded me that didnt yet know for whom the empty chair had been provided
Hastily reviewed the testimony of Rokh of Alicia and of Tem ple
Most of the characters involved were assembled here
Was one of them absent
There was and after moment of thought placed him
What about that old clubfooted caretaker Hargis
But Hargis was dead
Temple himself had found him dead
Even so did the chair signify Hargis confronting Landren in line with the unlighted candle
TVTOW well along in Landrens account of tiger hunt the bell of the front door rang shrilly
It cut raucously in on Landrens recital and he was forced to pause while Temple said to Rokh There he is at last
Well better late than never
Show him in Rokh The lascar withdrew
Stepping into the front hall he closed the diningroom door behind him
Then he went forward to the main entrance of the house
We heard him open the door heard the faint hum of his voice as he greeted caller
He came back along the hall conduct ing the visitor toward us
We could not see but we could hear
What we heard was limping clumping tread
Certain indication that this caller progressed un der the handicap of some pedal affliction
He came bumping along down the hall with an uneven cadence as would man with wooden leg or club foot
Of course not for Hargis was dead
But Startled breathless almost forgot to watch Landren
When did look his way he seemed to be no mare than mild ly curious
Certainly there were no moist beads on his forehead
Clump clump
The steps reached the very door of our room
Then we were let down ridiculously
The lame visitor turned to one side down narrower hall which knew led to the study
In moment Rokh came in alone
Who was it Rokh Temple asked
Man come to fix telephone Did only imagine that smile of de rision formed for an instant on the lips of Landren
Was the man laughing in his sleeve at this futile trap set by Temple
thought could read defeat on my hosts face
Had he played his last card
saw him shrug his strong broad shoul ders then his eyes met Alicias
And now as Temple weakened Alicia seemed to grow more determined
The resolution of her slim trim shoulders the set of her lips assured me that she did not mean to give up
Landrens marriage with Eve Marland was due within the Dime Detective Magazine weekunless Alicia Carterall and John Temple succeeded in revealing the true identity of monstrous murderer
CHAPTER THREE The Man with the Club Foot INNER over our procession back to the library was in different order
Alicia took possession of John Temple while Eve followed with her fiance
The older woman managed that in frantic effort to hold council of war
When reached the library Alicia had my host and client aside in an alcove
could see that she was insisting upon some move to which he objected
Suddenly Temple beckoned to me
Nothings left he said in sotto voice but to accuse the devil to his face
My idea now is to take him into the study alone and give him until midnight to get out of the state forever
In that case we promise not to tell the facts to Eve and her family agreed that the kindest thing we could do would be to let the girl think Landren merely hounding deserter
But Alicia objected
She wanted to ac cuse Landren was sure she could do it more effectively than anyone else
While they argued Rokh took the is sue quite out of their hands
His voice startled us
Turning quickly we saw that he was addressing not Landren but Eve Marland
You are his sixth the lascar said to Eve
When he tires of you he will push you into deep pit
It was so with the others Rokh bowed caressed the scar on his forehead and fixed steady gaze on Lan dren
Then while we were all still gasp ing he backed from the room
Landren gaped after him
Then he turned with an assured smile and asked of Temple Is he screwy Eve after moment of speechless shock exclaimed It isnt at all funny
dont like it
want you to take me home Alicia went to her beseechingly
Please be warned she said
myself heard that same warning and didnt believe it
was as loyal and trusting as you are now
And yet later he tried to push me into pit thought the girl would scream
But it seemed to freeze on her lips as she shrunk away from Alicia and clung close to Landrens arm
If its joke dont like it at all she said faintly
was his wife Alicia insisted
His right name is Septimus Cedar Landrens expression had been amused ly tolerant
Now it became bit impatient
Im like Eve he said
If this is joke it doesnt wash down bit His arm went around the girl
Lets go home Leonard She took his arm and urged him toward the door
But Landren didnt retreat
If theres music he said with shrug to Alicia lets face it
Do you really think Im someone else know you were my husband Septi mus Cedar Thats perfectly wild Eve protested
Please sit down wont you Alicia urged her gently
You must hear what have to say Do Eve Landren himself seconded
prefer to stand the girl said
She was perfectly sure saw that Landren was impeccable
TEGINNING her story Alicia spoke directly to Eve in tone infinitely gentle and compassionate
You will know tell the truth she said because of what it costs me
When am through man who has honored me with an offer of his namfe will forever despise me
have told him only part of the truth
When he hears the rest of it he will know me for cheat and hate me The Seventh Cedar Beyond doubt she was referring to John Temple
saw blank astonishment grow now on Temples face
Beyond any doubt he had been asking Alicia to marry him all of these past three years
Now em bodied in her warning to Eve she was telling him why she had refused
When Septimus Cedar met and mar ried me Alicia said was trapeze performer in an Australian circus by sum mer
Winters had bit parts in stock company
Soon after he married me Mr Cedar put me up at Honolulu hotel and went away on business
He was scouting for new pearl beds he said
At bamboo bungalow which he kept on an almost deserted island he came upon fugitive thief
He recognized the man as Guy Affering trust officer who once absconded from New York with large fortune in cash Guy Affering
Immediately remem bered the case
The man had absconded years ago with more than million dol lars and had never been found
Eve was still highchinned and hostile toward Alicia and Landren was still half tolerant and half impatient But Alicia had their ears anyway
Arkles Temple and moved closer
To one side glimpsed Rokh as he peered from be hind the draperies at the hall arch
My husband Alicia said accosted ffie fugitive by his right name
Affering an old man with misshapen foot at first denied the Identity
But after few nights of heavy drinking he admitted he was Affering
What of it
His only crime was larceny and from here they could not extradite him
In any case the cash was safely buried on the island
To get it for himself my husband took pains to woo the confidence of Affering
He befriended the old cripple who was in ill health from succession of fevers and half mad from lonely brooding
He told Affering to make himself at home at the bungalow
If anyone chanced to stop by he could call himself Hargis thg caretaker Landren interrupted
Do under stand he inquired without heat that when you say your husband Septimus Cedar you refer to myself do Alicia said keeping her gaze on Eve
Eve was the color of chalk
To her Landren whispered Its crazy dear
But lets hear her out Nights of drinking there with Affer ing Alicia said disclosed to my hus band the reasons for the old mans in sane brooding
Safely aflight and using new name Affering had married young blond girl at San Diego California
Forty years his junior she had married him for his money with the idea of spend ing it with chosen lover
Old Affering found that out when she filed suit for divorce and half his estate on trumped up charge
He didnt dare fight the suit because it would expose him fugitive to the scrutiny of the courts
So he ran off taking all his cash with him to South America
It was during that period of his career that street car crushed his foot maiming him for life
Three times later in his wanderings he again married each time to young girl
His second was Chilena at Iqueque his third Russian in the Slavic colony at Shanghai his fourth was Kanaka girl from the island of Maui
The Chilena probably played fair with him Alicia said
But the old man was jealous of her young friends
He was bitter in state of mind to imagine in fidelities
His next the Shanghai Russian was tartar
She tried to poison him
Affering found it out and left her for the Kanaka on Maui where again he imagined infidelities which did not exist
He ended up half crazy with bitterness at my hus bands bamboo refuge on the island
Dime Detective Magazine There in his drinking bouts with my husband he constantly heaped impreca tions against his four deserted wives
should have throttled them all he would rage
If werent coward and cripple Id go back and do it now tTVHE ordeal of this recital was taking terrific toll from Alicia
She halted it for moment during which tried to picture the mentality of Affering as he rotted amongst the weeds of his bitter ness on that island
One night in his cups Alicia said he offered to give all of his money to the man who would do it for him
My husband was interested
He led the dis cussion on
Immediately he saw way to deceive the old manhe saw way to make it appear that the four women were murdered when really there was no vio lence at all
His first idea was to go away and return in suitable time with faked news accounts telling of four sepa rate homicides
Now he bargained with Affering through many nights of drinking
Finally he got the names and addresses of the four women
But Affering was sharp enough to see the news accounts could be faked
So he would not trust them
fThe four women must be brought to the island one by one and killed before Affer ings eyes
Affering coward would him self have no contact with the crimes
He would merely watch from distance
Then he would pay the price Eve Marland by now was gripped with horror
One small white fist was pushed against her lips
Landren stood with his arm around her keenly attentive
What struck me most forcibly was the revela tion that the four wives were not after all Cedars but Afferings
My husband Alicia resumed pre tended to agree
One of the approaches to the bamboo bungalow was path be side which was deep pit
The plot finally hatched was this as the agent ar rived in turn with each wife he would lead her toward the bungalow along that path
Affering would be watching from the bungalow
certain signal would sig nify that he saw the couple coming
Then in each case the agent would topple the victim into the pit My throat was dry when asked But surely you Miss Carterall didnt agree to lend yourself to any such monstrous deceptions She shot pleading glance toward John Temple
thought was lending my self only to the saving of four lives Temples hand was on her shoulder
Of course Alicia he said gently
could see now why she had refrained from telling him of these horrors before
Though her motives at the time were honest later knowledge of the facts had shamed her
She bared them now only as last bitter resort to warn Eve Marland
Affering gave my husband four letters one to each wife
Each letter said he was side and dying and for the woman to come
Theyll come fast enough he said bitterly for they each want my money My husband then went to Honolulu where had been all this while
He told me about the plan but entirely distorted his motive for pretending to comply
He is very persuasive man
Miss Marland
And was infatuated with him as you are now
His method of pretending to comply was this we would go in turn to San Diego Iqueque Shanghai and Maui
Without accosting any of them we would observe each woman who had worked on the stage would prepare costume and makeup for each one
The motive he gave me for pretend ing to comply was that if he refused then Affering would seek another agent
Ha would entrust those errands of murder to the first beachcomber who came along
The Seventh Cedar and in the end his offer would be ac cepted
So why not make him think the crimes had been consummated
What harm would there be in deceiving him
My husband glib and convincing made me think it fine chivalrous crusade
For pay Affering would give my husband the cash fortune which would then be sent anonymously to the New York trust com pany from which it had been embezzled
Dont you see every end of justice would be served
TOR moment we were all breathless
Instead of being absurdly fantastic the thing now was really beginning to seem neatly plausible
Yet Landren chose to exclaim Amaz ing my dear young lady
As under stand the first four wives were Affer ings only the fifth was mine and she doubled for the victims at each murder His vein of sarcasm was plain enough
Alicia ignored him faced Eve
We did it she said
Four times from distance the rheumy eyes of Affering saw me pushed into the pit
But swing had been erected in it in each case un beknownst to Affering
As an extrapeze artist it was easy for me to catch the swing then to lower myself on rope to the bottom
From there crawled through the tunnel to the beach hiding under the cliff until my husband had chance to pick me up Did you deceive Affering on all four occasions asked
We thought we did but probably we didnt
Or maybe Affering simply welched on the bargain
Anyway he declined to turn over the money
was at Nukualofa when it happened
But when my husband returned to me he did not admit the failure
He told me that he had received the money from Affering and had shipped it anonymously to the rightful owners For what reason would he tell you that To keep me from writing letters of warning to the four threatened wives
If did that would start hornets nest buzzing
Affering would soon have visi tors
He would no longer be private mark for my husband who still hoped to get the money
After while Alicia told us be gan to worry about Affering
He was now just broken old cripple sick and dying on lonely island
had conspired to deceive him so now thought of him and pitied him
insisted that we take him supplies of food and medicine
When my husband agreed mistook his motive for kindness
Actually he merely wanted to stalk that buried fortune once again
We went
This time was in my true character
Rokh did not recognize me as the Nordic blonde the Iqueque Chilena the Shanghai Slav or the brown Kanaka he had transported on earlier occasions
Thinking me fifth wife he warned me AT THAT statement of Alicias could no longer doubt any part of the story
It made Rokhs testimony match perfectly with Alicias
Reaching the island she said we left Rokh on the beach with his boat and climbed to the hilltop bungalow
There we found Affering dead in bed
He had succumbed to fever
Toward the last how ever he apparently had made desperate effort to gather up his loot and get away
How did you gather that asked
Because we saw all of the longburied money right there on the table
Septimus Cedar tried to explain away the lie he had told me about the return of the money
Disgusted refused to listen to his pro testations
As left the bungalow he took my arm to guide meit was darkand as he argued we moved along that jungle Dime Detective Magazine path toward the cliff
Suddenly saw the pit
This time there was no swing or rope in it
And felt my husbands grip tight en on my arm
He intended to kill me so that he could take the money with out it being known Soyou escaped Landren asked even ly of Alicia
Now please let us
Tins has been rather exhausting you know He directed weary smile first at Tem ple then at Arkles then at me
We re turned it with frigid stares
John Tem ples hand was still resting lightly on Ali cias shoulder
It must have told her that the new light she had thrown on the mat ter made no difference
Nor was Eve Marland less loyal to the man who called himself Landren
What flashed through my own lawyers mind was this there was really nothing on Landren even if we baited him into admitting he was Cedar
Cedar had mur dered no one
More and more it was clear that all we could hope for was to make Eve Mar land see that he was Cedar
Please take me home Leonard she said now
And Alicia beseeched her Please be convinced
was his wife
He cant look at me and deny it But Landren couldand did
Then he permitted Eve to draw him toward the door
Alicia followed still pro testing courageously
Very well she said
He is brazen enough to face me
But could he face the four wives of Affering That challenged them into stopping
Are you going to pull them out of hat came derisively from Landren
Alicia said in breathless rush to Eve Its test he cant face
dare him to try
mean dare him to look at me as was made up to deceive Affering Eves eyes were like saucers
Alicia said In trunk upstairs have all four of those costumes
My maid is there to help me make up
Hes afraid to she said tensely to Eve
She had guessed some ace in the hole
Hes afraid she challenged
Theres evidence in those four characters which he cannot face
And he knows it Her words fired our imaginations
And to Landren they gave no choice
If he withdrew now he would seem to retreat in poor order from new and vital evi dence
Lets see it through Eve he sighed
And we might as well make ourselves comfortable When he had induced Eve to sit down Alicia Carterall left us
We heard her run up the steps tb her room
CHAPTER FOUR The Seventh Cedar TN remarkably short time Alicia came down made up to represent the first of Afferings four wives
was disap pointed for the deception was not par ticularly effective
The San Diego woman had been described as blonde and Alicia had had no time to treat the blackness of her own hair
She had overcome that drawback par tially by concealing her hair under jaunty yatching cap
She wore white duck trousers and middy blouse and was smoking cigarette
Her lips and cheeks were redder and she had done something to her eyebrows
It would be fairer if we had moonlight she said
When she turned off all the lights ex cept one dim yellow globe in far comer the deception was slightly improved
Like manikin Alicia posed before Landren turning so that he saw each profile
Her hobby was boating you remember she reminded Landren
It was in this dress we saw her so we copied it Isnt that so The Seventh Cedar You know Landren said to Eve Im really beginning to believe shes sincere and that she has me confused with someone else My maid has the next costume ready and Ill be down again quickly Alicia said
Be patient please She hurried out and up die stairs
As we waited in the gloom spoke in an undertone to Temple
This is no part of your program It is not he said
And cant see her object Chilena Russian and Kanaka was thinking would be brunettes
Therefore Alicia herself brunette would be better fitted for those parts
With stage experience and maid to help her she could make quick changes
When Alicia appeared before us as the Chilena she was much more convincing
Over her head was crimson mantilla its fold pushed back just far enough to show her fine ebon hair
This hair was now centerparted
The ends of the man tilla hung forward over her shoulders
Her dress had laced bodice and short wide skirt and in this hands at hips she whirled like dervish before Landren
It was my scream she reminded him softly which helped most to deceive Affering
You remember how always screamed when you pushed me into the pit
Like this Alicia screamed earsplittingly
It was enough to curdle ones blood
If Landren lost color we couldnt blame him
For so did all of us
Then in flash Alicia was gone
TN little while Alicia appeared before us as the Shanghai Russian
This time she looked weirdly wicked
She wore long jade earrings
The slave bracelets on her wrists were coiled silver serpents and her slim figure was tightly gowned in anklelength satin
Her painted face
was dappled with round black spots
feather fan half hid it as she weaved sinuously in the gloom before Landren
Do you remember she challenged what time we had duplicating these She shook the twin bracelets before the eyes of Landren
That Shanghai girl had wheedled them out of Affering
Fail ing to duplicate them you posed as collector and actually bought the originals from the girl
Later as straggled in your grasp by the pit one of them came off and fell on the path
Seen there next day by Affering it was compelllngly con vincing Take me away Leonard Eve Mar land pleaded
She was clinging as loyally as ever to Landrens arm
But theres only one more model believe Landren said
So lets see it through
Would you mind getting done with it quickly
Miss Carterall shall get done with it quickly enough Alicia promised and left us
That last be tweenacts interval was solemn and silent
myself was anything but confident
Alicia had paraded in three characters without as far as could tell making any impression upon Landren
At last the fourth and final model ap peared before us
This time she was really convincing
Here as real as life seemed to be chocolateskinned Kanaka
was amazed that Alicia could have so transformed herself thus swiftly
Nor had she depended much on ornaments or properties of costume
Her dress was simple house frock
Her head and arms were bare
Bare and as brown as India
No won der we stared
The model posed for long minute before Landren then quite suddenly the lights came on
Instantly Landren was on his feet
One single word was shocked from him Kalanilu Dime Detective Magazine That is my name the model said
And the voice was not Alicias
Then the truth flashed
Instead of com ing down herself Alicia had sent her maid
And the maid not only looked like the Kanaka bride of Guy Affering but she was that very girl
Suddenly Alicia still dressed as the Shanghai vampire appeared beside her Kanaka maid
Septimus Cedar knows her name of course she said to Eve although have not mentioned it
Only for brief moment did the sur prise shatter Landrens defense
But it was long enough
Eve had seen his face in that moment and heard his one spoken word
He had given himself away
Expecting to see mere imitator sud den sight of the real article had proved too much for him
It had slipped his mask and could only marvel at the genius of the thrust
It far outshone any which had been offered by Temple
What fine foundation had been laid in the deliberate parade of three spurious char acters
Then when she had him smugly off guard Alicia had bowled him over with the real thing
ANDREN was trying to right himself with Eve
But Eve was backing away from him
She was disillusioned
That one peep behind the mask had been enough
Instantly she was through for ever with Landren
Gazing at him with growing horror she took the ring from her finger
When she held it toward him he de clined to take it
It fell with tinkle to the floor
When Landren stepped toward her arms futilely outstretched his own foot crushed it
Then Temples voice boomed decisively
Rokh please show Mr Cedar to the gate
Not merely to the door Rokh but to the gate Septimus Cedar turned on his heel and left the room
Rokh followed
They went out the front door and we heard it bang shut behind them
Then possibly half minute later thought heard some sort of cry out there
wasnt sure though
Those with me were too engrossed to hear anything at all
The maid had gone upstairs
Eve was crying while Bud Arkles vainly tried to comfort her
John Temple was speaking earnestly aside with Alicia
Lighting cigar puffed it thought fully
After while tried to join Temple and Alicia but there found three to be crowd
So strolled across the hall to the gunroom
Once more three made crowd for found Eve and Bud seated on bench the girl weeping on the boys shoulder
There seemed nothing for me to do but pace the hall and chew on another cigar
Half an hour later went out on the dark front porch
The sky was overcast not star or moon in sight
It was trying to storm
The atmosphere was depressingly sultry
Occasionally the horizon gave wink of lightning
In one of them glimpsed the six cedars
And thought saw Rokh engaged in seme odd chore to the right of the rightmost cedar
There was only the splitsecond glimpse of him
It exposed him with garden spade in the inexplicable act ef tossing shovelful of earth into newly dug hole
Rokh shouted but he did not answer
Perhaps thought was mis taken
It was as dark as Egypt again
Yet in few minutes there came another wink of storm light
This time was sure saw Rokh
He was at the same spot still to the right of the rightmost cedar and this time saw him patting down block of sod with his spade
When the dark girlstark horror in her eyeshanded Johnny Connell that cryptic note in the hotel lobby he never guessed it would be the
initial twist that would turn murder setup into OHNNY CONNELL had seen the dark girl once or twice about the hotel but he had never spoken to her didnt know her name
She had lovely mouth finely curved and dark eyes above it that were uncertain and anxious in pale young face
Now she seemed to be coming to him straight across the lobby smiling with the slightest trembling of her lips both hands outstretched to him
Jack Ballard she cried with the smile wavering desperately
How nice seeing you
When did you get in Johnny Connell was puzzled
Im sorry he said
There must She did not turn her head but her eyes moved quickly to the man at her shoulder and her palm gripping closer against lift Dime Detective Magazine Johnnys pushed square of paper into his hand
He stopped speaking and in the same instant the girl released him stepped back her laugh brittle forced
Im so sorry she said
Of course its mistake
You arent Jack Ballard at all are you
Do forgive me The tall dark man standing behind her had dead black hair worn long at the back almost like mane his mouth was narrow and wide under high brows arched over heavily lidded black eyes
He did not speak nor did the girl again but her strained features kept telling Johnny Con nell something
When he dropped his hand to his side with the paper still hid den in it he thought he detected sudden relief in her expression
Of course Johnny Connell said
He bowed the tall man bowed
The girl smiled brilliantly took her companions arm said Sorry again and moved away
Johnny Connell stared after them puz zled
When they vanished inside the ele vator cage he opened his palm glanced at the paper
It was heavy linen folded in quarters still damp from her touch
On the outside was written in womans hand To Mr Paul Aberdeen Folsotn Road North
Wont you take this over at once Nick
Frowning Johnny Connell turned it over and looked inside
There was more writing on the inner fold but he did not read that
After moment he put it in his pocket and crossed to the elevator
OHNNY left the cage at the ninth floor and turned down the corridor to the room he shared with Nick Mallory
Nick was blond young man with white teeth and nice grin he played the saxophone in the hotel orchestra from nine to one
When Johnny came into the room he was standing before the dresser mirror tying black bow around his wing collar
Hows the little Rock Mountain golf pro he asked cheerfully
Fine Johnny Connell said seriously giving him the note
just got this down stairs in the lobby
It must be for you Romeo
dark girl gave it to me just now the one saw you talking to last night The cheerfulness went out of Nicks face it twisted little under suddenly sullen eyes
He straightened out the ends of his tie got into his coat picked up the note and put it down again
He went half way to the door and then stopped
Johnny Connell said quietly It cant be as bad as all that
If you want to tell Papa Why not Nick said
His anile was crooked
Its an old story and you heard it before
Not that theres hell of lot to it Johnny
knew the girl when she was Diane Aberdeen she danced in night club back in New York while was in the house orchestra
Young love He waved his hand tried to grin
Soft music and stuff like that
guess Id been seeing too many movies
figured on marrying her when bankers kid turned upthis Noel French that died on her two months back
You know how it ends dont you Nick kept smiling broadly
She gives this millionaire boy the gate didnt have any money but what was that
She loved me and she gave up everything for me After moment he added tiredly Nuts
It wasnt movie
woke up one morn ing and saw it all in the papers
Theyd been married in Greenwich
So what He laughed with kind of leaden sound
Johnny Connell didnt say anything
Nick looked down at him repeated Im not sucker
was once and learned something from it
learned to stay clear
She tried to speak to me last night when you saw us but ducked her
You can forget them Johnnyany of them
Suicide Pact He stopped his eyes were suddenly dark and miserable
Whos this Aberdeen she wants the note to go to
Her father guess Nick said
Hazelher mothermarried twice
met Paul Aber deen the first one Dianes father
He and Hazel played secondclass vaudeville houses all their lives
The old lady raised up Diane as dancer took her around with them on their trips
She divorced Aberdeen two years ago and married some Spaniard Johnny Connell remembered the tall man in the lobby
His eyes grew thought ful and he moved one hand toward the note
What are you going to do with that
Nothing Nick Malloiy told him the darkness coming back into his eyes
Slip it into an envelope and give it to bellhop if you want She could have phoned him Suppose she couldnt Johnny said
Couldnt Nick stared at him
Whats to stop her
Cant you see what it is
This French is dead now and she has all the money shell ever need
She liked me once and when she sees me here she thinks itd be nice if we He turned with his eyes savage went over to the dresser poured out drink
Johnny Connell looked doubtful
He said Maybe youre wrong
Shes just kid Nickshe looked scared as hell Nick pulled his coat smooth over his shoulders and crossed to the door
He said with it half open The old army game
Youll wise up Johnny
did CK went out slamming the door and in moment Johnny Connell got up roamed absently over to the window
funny guy Nicktrying to kid himself trying to be hard when he wasnt really underneath
And the girl She had looked frightened no matter what Nick said
Johnny Connell wondered what had scared her
The buzzer sounded
Johnny Connell crossed the room and opened the door
The tall Spaniard who had been with the girl downstairs bowed in at him from the corridor
He had quiet slightly harsh voice while he spoke his heavily lidded eyes seemed fixed on Johnny Connells nose
He said Mrs
French is sorry about the mistake
She did not wish to trouble you
The resemblance unfortunately He shrugged and his thin lips drew in without looking much like smile
His right hand came out palm up
You will let me have the note now please Connell said dont understand The Spaniards lips contracted his hand moved fast
Johnny Connell was surprised at its grip
It fastened on his arm swung him easily to one side as it might child before he had time to brace himself
The Spaniard went past him into the room
Johnny left the door open and took three long steps
When he was before the Spaniard again his face was no longer pleasant
He said Get out of my room The Spaniard looked from under droop ing lids at Johnny almost quizzically without answering
Then he turned away saw the note on the table where Nick Mallory had dropped it
His hand had nearly closed on it when Johnny Connell hit him
He got to his feet slowly all the blood in his face gathered beneath the dark bruise just under his jaw
When Johnny Connell said again Get out his body twitched his chest moved deeply with out sound
The Spaniard moved unsteadily like drunkard back to the door
He kept watching Johnny Connell silently with his insane eyes until the panel of brown wood shut him off
When he had gone Johnny Connell Dime Detective Magazine rubbed his knuckles
Why would the girl send him up now to get the note
Ten minutes ago she hadnt wanted him to know anything about it Staring at the note Johnny could see her lovely mouth and the terrified look in her eyes
girl like that scaredand then this bird Johnny Connell swore
He took the note from the table grabbed light gray coat from the closet and went out to the hall
In the lobby he stopped just long enough to get directions from the night clerk for finding Folsom Road
AUGUST was the busy season for Rock Mountain
Outside the resort hotel village streets that would be de serted in winter were now crowded with groups of vacationists
Guitar music strummed faintly in from the lake over the lazy slap slap of oars far off girl laughed and the sound came to Johnny Connell thin tinkling
It set him think ing about Diane and he was thinking about her as he reached Folsom Road
There were no street lights but most of the houses were lit and he stopped his roadster at the sixth one ina threestory frame residence with square dark porch facing the road
His ring was answered by pleasantlooking woman with gray hair and plump face
Aberdeen she said
Im afraid he just left
If youd like to come in and wait Im sure hell be back shortly She smiled at him again and Johnny Connell went in followed her brisk feet up to the third landing
There was small space here barred off by walls of new plaster with doors on either side
The woman opened one on the left
There She snapped on wall light in the room watched him sit down patted her clean apron anxiously
Just make yourself comfortable
Mr Aberdeen al ways wants his guests brought up
Im sure he wont be long Johnny Connell put his hat on the table and looked around after she left him
It was sitting roan not large rather drab
There was grass rug on the floor some pieces of worn wicker furniture scattered around tall lamp at the farther side that wasnt Kt
The wall bulb threw weak glow over his chair but left the rest of the room shadowy and vague save for the dull glitter of brass smoking stand lying flat on the floor near the farther wall
Just under the edge of the stand there was womans shoe
It made Johnny Connell uneasy he didnt know why
He got up and took restless step staring at the shoe
One shoe
Where He turned and looked over the rug walked to one side so that he could see behind chair
The mate wasnt anyplace
There was thick reddish stain on the sharp edge of the heel
Johnny Connell began to feel intensely hot
He wondered what the hell was the matter with him
The quietness of course nerves
Anybody might have had nosebleed
Taking the smoking stand with him he went back to his chair and sat down
Five minutes went byten
Nothing at all happened
His eyes began to ache and he realized suddenly that he had been staring at the door on the far side of the room ever since his cigarette went out
The door was closed shadows were thick over it
If there was bathroom inside there where he could get some water His throat was parched
Aberdeen shouldnt care if He got up quickly and walked over opened the door
It was dark inside though not wholly so he could see pale curtains motionless at window the paler white splotch of bed
There was some thing on the bed
Johnny Connell stayed where he was in the doorway something inside his stomach cold and hard
The quietness was like Suicide Pact death
The thing on the bed didnt move
Even before he forced himself to go over to it Johnny Connell knew that it would never move
TTHE woman had her face down on the coverlet
She had black hair cropped close and below it on her neck thin strand of Cord was drawn tight into the puffed flesh
Her feet dangled over the edge of the bed and one shoe was missing
Her fingers were drawn up in fist on blanket folded at the foot of the bed
Johnny Connell touched it briefly went back to the sitting room with his face pale and hard
Just inside the door he heard steps on the outer stairs
While he stood there the corridor door opened and small man in white pants and blue coat came in
The small man stopped
Johnny Con nell said was asked to bring this note to you
Your daughter He had to clear his throat Youre Mr Aberdeen The small man came into the light
He blinked quickly furrowing the flesh of his forehead into ridges read the note and put it in his pocket his head bent slightly to one side so that he still looked up at Johnny Connell
Then he turned his eyes darting to the bedroom door and Johnny turning too saw that he had left it open behind him
The small mans face blurred and ran together
Words tears tumbled out brokenly his hands came up and pawed
didnt Before God Its plant kid
came home and she was there like you saw her
Gods truth He stuttered gasped his lips wobbled
Connell said Who killed her Aberdeen came close his eyes moving anxiously up and down over the others face
Im telling you kidGods truth
came home from the movies and there she is where you see her
The first tiling thought was to get train out of here
Then theyd find her tomorrow and if left like that everyone would think killed her
thought then could leave her on road somewhere so they wouldnt know where it happened Johnny Connell watched him
He asked after moment Dont you even know her
She couldnt get in here without being seen
Your landlady would have No no His words beat out feebly
asked Mrs Harris did anybody come
She didnt know because shed been over at her mothers and just got back
She just made the place over into apartments
Theres no bells yet for the different ones so she leaves the porch door open all the time
Tonight shes out and so am
Anybody couldve come up
Whod have seen them Then you dont know who she is Aberdeen hesitated shifting his eyes
After silence he admitted know her
Her names Esther Greenberg
Sheshe was nurse He raised his hands caught Johnny Connells lapels
You go see Diane
Tell her Miss Greenbergs dead the nurse that took care of Noel
Maybe shell Johnny Connell stared at him at the bedroom door then took his hat from the table
Ill see Diane he said
Dont go away TVHE clerk at the hotel gave him the number of Mrs Frenchs suite and he went up in the elevator and rang twice at the door of before it drew back
In the opening negligeed woman with face shiny from cold cream stared at him
The woman said Well Over her shoulder Johnny Connell saw Diane
Its all right mother the girl said slipping before her
Dont bother
Then the Spaniard was there too just behind her gripping her wrist
He said Dont go out Dime Detective Magazine Dianes mother looked at Johnny Con nell sharply
The gentleman can come in
That is if its No Diane tried to edge out
want to see him alone
Its important mother
Its about Nick Her small wrist twisted in the Spaniards hold and Johnny Con nell breathed hard
He took half step forward in the same instant that Diane got her arm free and came out to him dosing the door on her mothers protest ing voice
Nick couldnt bring the note he said
He was due on the floor at nine
took it over Oh She smiled faintly
thought Nickbut it doesnt matter awfully
It was nice of you It took long time for more words to come
He asked finally Did youdo you know girl named Esther Green berg Her eyes searched his frowning
Johnny Connell tried to dress it up and couldnt
There didnt seem any way
He said at last quietly Esther Greenbergs dead
Shedied tonight in your fathers apartment Her whole body was shaking
Johnny Connell gripped her elbows gently and said Its all right Diane
Dont worry about it
Nobody knows but your father Knows She rubbed one side of her face dazedly
But you dont understand
You know dont Johnny Connell said
came back to find out
want to help you Diane Three people got off the elevator in the center of the corridor walked up toward them and entered room ten feet away
When they had closed the door Johnny Connell said Dont be afraid
told you want to help you Diane
Just tell me what its all about
Why did you ask me to bring that note to your father to night
Couldnt you have gone yourself Her white face smiled desperately
Yes of course She raised her arm and the puffed part of her sleeve dropped back
Against her wrist Johnny Connell saw purplish marks
She made an aimless little gesture with her hand
Noel she said
Noel Her voice broke
Noel was killed too HTHE slow whisper died while he stared at her
Everybody thought it was pneumonia
You see Noel had had that once but hed recovered
Then last Sep tember he went out with Ramon to party and he came home drunk
The next morn ing he was sick again
hadnt slept in his roomnot for months
Wewe hadnt got along
When wanted to call doctor this time Ramon wouldnt let me
He said Noel would be all right
And then the next night went in late thought heard Noel call
He he had nothing over him but sheet and all the windows were open
got some blankets and put them over him and while was fixing the bed had to touch the sheets She shuddered her voice became so low that Johnny Connell could scarcely hear it
They were wet soaked through
Then Ramon came in
He said it was just night sweat and it meant that Noel was getting better
But it frightened me and called doctor when got back to my room
He came up in little while and went into Noels room with him but someone had changed the sheets then they were dry
The doctor said Noel was very sick and he had to have nurses all the time he sent one up that morning and Miss Greenberg relieved her the next night
thought that would make every thing safe but it didnt
went in to see Noel again about twelve that night and the same thing had happened
There werent any blankets and the bed was soaked just as if someone had poured ice Suicide Pact water over it
Noel was raving could hear Ramon and Miss Greenberg talking in the living room downstairs
Ramon had some bottles out on the table
think he was trying to get Miss Greetiberg drunk so she wouldnt know anything about it
made her go upstairs and change the bed
Ramon came with us and when he said it was night sweat Miss Greenberg looked at him queerly
Then in the morning he told me it must have been an accident and hed fired her for being careless
He made me give him five hundred dollars for the doctors he said
But think he gave it to Miss Greenberg so she wouldnt say anything
Two days later Noel died She began to sob quietly
And then he said if ever told anyone about it theyd say planned it to get Noels money
He said hed swear that he caught me once soaking the sheets
Id go to prison maybe the chair
No one would believe me Johnny Connell murmured something from between gray lips for the first time in his life he wanted to kill man
The girl went on dully was afraid
The only person told was father
Ive never done anything wanted even when was child
Mother decided everything never thought of questioning her Her lovely mouth quivered faintly she looked past Johnny Connell over his shoulder
When met Nick it was the same
Mother said he was no good that he had nothing that owed her every thing and should do what she wanted to pay her back little
She talked to me about marrying Noel all the time
Id be ungrateful if didnt hed be so good to me
And when told her wouldnt that II loved Nick she got sick she had bad heart
She said shed die Her strangled sobs seemed to rise in Johnny Connells own body
He patted her shoulder said softly But its all right now Diane
What was in the note Mother told me to cash some bonds Noel left
She said Ramon had informa tion that the company was going to crash and if didnt get the money soon theyd be valueless
The bank here arranged it this morning Ramon was to get the moneya hundred thousand dollarsand put it in safedeposit vault
But he didnt do thatI happened to see it in his traveling bag upstairs just before dinner
When asked him he lied to me he said he had put it in the vault
was afraid to say anything to him but thought if father knew he could tell me what to do
Father has no phone
thought Nick would take it over
When couldnt see him in the lobby gave the note to you Id seen you talking to Nick once and hoped youd know who it was for Johnny Connell took her arm
Im going to get your father
want you to wait in my room until get back The terror gathered again in her eyes
But cant
Ramon Ramons through
He wont bother you again
Ever TEN minutes later he stopped his road ster in Folsom Road
Without ring ing for the landlady he pushed back the unlocked porch doorthat part of Aber deens story was apparently truewent past it into the vestibule and up the stairs
The little man relaxed nervously mop ping his face when he saw who it was
Johnny Connell closed the door to the hall and said Ive seen Diane she told me what happened to her husband
She said you knew too Aberdeens tone was cautious
knew sure
Thats why Ramon tried to frame me dyou see
He was afraid Id talk and he wanted to get something on me so couldnt Johnny Connell frowned
Its not clear yet
Why should Esther Greenberg come Dime Detective Magaxii here
You had nothing to do with her Im telling you Aberdeen said
If open my mouth now about young French theres this to pin on me
Say this nurse knew about how he died and was blackmailing Ramon
He gets my address off letter write to Diane and then sends Esther Greenberg note to meet him here at eight oclock
just found it in her bag Aberdeen moved his shoulders
The landladys rooms are in the back and he knew she wouldnt see him if he didnt ring the bell
He warns the girl not to ring the bell but just to come up It began to fit in Johnny Connells head
If this nurse was blackmailing him he wanted to meet her here to pay her off
She had stiff price Aberdeen hundred thousand dollars hun The little man scuttled around the table his mouth twisting
What are you talking about
Where would he get that kind of money Johnny Connell told him
When he had finished Aberdeen said his voice shaking Hes robbing my girll knew it
Thats why He gripped Johnny Connells wrist feverishly
You see it dont you
My girl and young French werent getting along and this rat sees two million dollars slipping out from under his hand
So he kills young French and in smart enough way so no one suspects
Only this nurse knew and she bled him
Today she prob ably wanted the money all in lump and he gets it for her then he must have fig ured shed want more all the time and theres no sense in giving her this much
So he kills her and pins it on me He stopped breathing very fast crossed the room and vanished inside closet
When he came back he had revolver in his right hand with long clumsylook ing silencer attachment on the barrel
Aberdeen snarled trembling He cant get away with this
Not on Diane nor on me Johnny Connells hand stopped him
Wait minute
You cant cant Aberdeen said
He stepped away and the butt of the gun came up like flicker of gray light
Even as he threw his hand out Johnny Connell felt it strike his head whirl him down endlessly through darkness and dreadful quiet TTE CAME to on the grass rug in dark ness with dull wave of torture beat ing in the back of his head
The wall light above him had been extinguished and the door to the corridor was closed
After minute he pushed himself up to wobbly legs groped for the wall switch and found it
It was ten minutes to one by his watch
In his room at the hotel Diane was sit ting in the leather chair where he had left her
Her face whitened when she saw him and she came instantly to her feet
Diana moved to him with chocked sound
Youre hurt she breathed
Did father The door in the outer room closed
Under her arm Johnny Connell saw Nick cross to the table his cheeks hollowed out by tuneless whistle
He stopped sud denly as he reached it staring at her his eyes going once to Johnny Connell and then back
She said Hello Nick in voice that wasnt quite steady
Nicks face flushed he inclined his head faintly
When no one spoke again he didnt seem to know what to do with his hands he put them in his pocket took them out again said Hello without looking at her
His mouth comers twitched little in face he tried to keep composed
Johnny Connell couldnt think of any thing to say
He sat where he was star ing at Nick until the girl turned to him
Suicide Pact think Ill go now
Youve been awfully kind but mother may be worry ing
Its very late Thats all right Johnny Connell said
His throat was dry
Just wait few min utes more Diane
Out there
want Nick to help me clean up She hesitated
If you think its Johnny Connell nodded
Its very important
wont keep you long She went out without looking at Nick and sat down near the door
Nick came in at his nod and when he had closed the door behind him Johnny Connell said Shes in trouble
Her husband was killed
The nurse that took care of him tried to blackmail the Spaniard and she was strangled tonight in Aberdeens place
Shes still there Nick said What very loud the word bursting from him
Take it easy
Her father told me Ramon killed this nurse
According to him he sent her note to meet him at Aberdeens place while Aberdeen was out
But theres no way of checking his story maybe Aberdeens lying and killed her himself
dont know
was over there just now and he laid me out with the butt of gun
This Ramons got Diane fright ened he says hell swear she killed her husband if she doesnt do what he wants Nicks eyes glittered
He said Ill tear the louse apart
Where Johnny Connell said Dont be down
She never loved Noel French the mother made her marry him
Get out there and talk to her and stop acting like kid thats been stood in comer He went out first
Diane got up her young face strained and desperate trying to smile
think Id better go
Youve Johnny Connell said gravely Im go ing to ask you something very important
You said Ramon was with you all evening
Did he leave you at any time even for half hour after eight oclock Her brows wrinkled
Im quite sure
We had supper together and then went up to our suite
He was there in the room until you came Nick came out from behind him and went over to her
She tried to get off the chair but his arms on either side held her down
He said Youve got to listen to me Diane She said No
dont want to
Please let me They seemed to have forgotten Johnny Connell
He went out closing the door quietly behind him
TN THE corridor he turned right to the stair shaft and went down three flights
The door of was unlocked the sit ting room within was lit and the Span iard and Dianes mother were sitting on couch just before him
Facing them little Aberdeen was almost lost in the arms of morris chair
Johnny Connell walked across the rug and sat down next to Aberdeen
Ramons body shifted on the couch one arm drop ping inside his scarlet bathrobe
He said Let me Hazel his voice purring
The hand came out again with long narrow bladed stiletto balanced unevenly on his fingers
He was halfway to his feet when the woman said sharply We dont need that
can call the manager and have him put out
He cant come here without any reason She reached for the phone brought it to her
Johnny Connell said came up for reason
came up to talk about girl named Esther Greenberg She put the phone back carefully on the table as if it were made of thin glass
Esther Greenberg She repeated the name as if it surprised her
What hap pened
Whats he talking about When nobody answered shrillness crept into her voice
And wheres Diane
She went out with him two hours ago and she hasnt come back since
Its after one Dime Detective Magazine She wont come back Johnny Con nell said
Youre never going to bother her again Why youre crazy Hazel was screaming beating hand on her knee
Bother her
My own daughter Behind her Ramons breathing became audible in sharp sound that halted even the womans voice
His arms moved and the scarlet bathrobe dropped off them his head went little forward so that he stared at Johnny Connell from under his high brows and his right arm came up to his breast slowly with the knife blade glittering in steel flashes as he flexed his wrist from side to side
Aberdeen said something in croaking tone but the woman remained silent her palms pressed against the back of the couch one knee bent on the cushion supporting her body
This time she did not stop the Spaniard he came forward with his steps spaced and light
Johnny Connell got free of his chair
The instant that he waited seemed very long
The thick hate in him tensed his muscles made breathing difficult
He had his weight forward on his toes and when Ramon was quite close he shot his body in against the Spaniards his right arm swinging up in vicious arch his left flung out to the knife
Taking the punch high on the cheek Ramon went back with it but he did not lose his bal ance and as Johnny Connell lunged after him he stepped in fast knife hand mov ing soundlessly like flame
Johnny Connell got the wrist with his hand pivoted smashed in his right to the Spaniards stomach
Ramons breath burst out his white face contorted in an instant he was against Johnny Con nells chest body strained to body arms bent to arms
For moment they were motionless
Johnny Connell tried to tear his right hand free his lips drawn back with effort but the Spaniard held him steady forced him back step by step with the centered pres sure of his arms
Ramons face smoothed out he smiled again but the smile was drawn out thinned by the straining of his body
The knife came closer to Johnny Con nell very slowly in jerks that moved perhaps an inch at time
He could not hold it away not even when the wall was behind him with his elbow braced out ward from it like lever
He had no longer any feeling in his arms save dull torment beating high in his shoul ders
When he was flat against the wall with his right arm spread eagled on it by Ramons left the Spaniards face raised above him composed and cruel with no sound but the rapid whistling of his breath
CROSS his shoulder Johnny Con nell could see the woman still kneel ing on the couch her hand against the back her negligee drawn up by the curve of her body almost over her knees
One foot dangled out of its slipper on the other leg just under the knee patch of adhesive was whiter than her skin
Johnny Connell stared foolishly at it
Somehow little Aberdeen was in the picture behind Ramon trying to push him aside his voice making high mono tonous sound
Ramon did not look at him he kept smiling at Johnny Connell the wide harsh mouth drawn in against gold teeth until its edges were lost in the flesh
Johnny Connell braced his body desper ately tore his right hand from the Spani ards and swung it up in blow that had no force
He knew that
It surprised him to see Ramons stomach cave in as he struck as if metal bar had smashed it
The Spaniard went down to the floor his tall body twisting rolling over got to his knees with the knife still in his hand and began to crawl forward again shak Suicide Pact ing his head
Johnny Connell seemed to hear the first pop then
At the second Ramon went down flat sprawled out his body shuddering lit tle
He held fallen on his back and his eyes stared up at Aberdeen at the smoke that trailed thickly from the long barrel of the little mans silencer
His black eyes fixed on that motionless and un winking but not until the knife slid from his hand to the hardwood floor with metallic tinkle did Johnny Connell rea lize he was dead
Pressed back against the couch Hazel stared at them silently her crimson mouth extraordinarily vivid and alive in her face
Aberdeen looked down at the dead man with perspiration watering his lean cheeks the gun in his hand jerking
When Johnny Connell came out from the wall he turned and spoke to him in squeaking voice
had to Kid
Hed have killed youhe was crazy
slugged you back there because didnt know who you were
When you tried to take the gun off me thought he might have sent you He nodded down at the dead man
Johnny Connell took the gun away from him
Go over to your place
Wait there
Ill help you later with Esther Greenberg Hazel began to cry
The little man hesitated nervously at the door and John ny Connell waved the gun at him until he went out
Hazel moaned brokenly Oh my God
But Ramon deserved it
He killed the Greenberg girl because she knew about young French
She wanted money off him and he went over there and killed her
He He couldnt have killed her John ny Connell said
He was with Diane all night Then who She stopped crying on her flabby face tears dried
Who You Johnny Connell said in flat voice
It grew very quiet they stared at each other in silence across the dead man
Hazels face grayed but she said calmly enough as if she were arguing with him over something that didnt mat ter great deal Youre insane
Why would kill her
Theres nothing Theres your leg Johnny Connell told her pointing the gun at it
You gat behind Esther Greenberg and strangled her and while you were doing it she kicked backward and cut your shm
In the excitement you forgot to wipe your blood off her slippermaybe you didnt even notice you were cut until you got back here
found her shoe in Aberdeens apartment with blood on the heel but until saw the adhesive on your leg couldnt understand what it meant After that it was plain enough she did what anybody would do who was being choked from behind
Kicked back
The blood puz zled me because knew that she didnt bleed but if she didnt her killer must have His tone was tired unargumentqtive
Hazel answered him in tone she tried to make amused and only made loud and slightly breathless
Youre insane
cut my leg today on the bathroom door
Aberdeen and can get the Green berg girls body away
If they find it on road tomorrow theyll think she was here on vacation and somebody picked her up and robbed her
She was black mailing Ramon and you and probably didnt say anything to outsiders about it
So nobody knows why she really came PHERE was another silence longer
She made two attempts to speak be fore words came out
What are you going Of course this is absurd
You cant tell the police
Just because cut my leg Johnny Connell rose from the arm ofl Dime Detective Magazii his chair
Youve forgotten something
They can test the blood on the slipper and find out if its ycmrs No she said
You wontyou cant
FI tell you why you cant
Be cause Im Dianes mother Gose to him her gray eyes glittering she repeat ed Im Dianes mother
And you love that girlyoud do anything for her
Thats the only reason youd be doing all this just so she wont be implicated
Youre taking chance on murder charge yourself so shell be clear Johnny Connells face was stony she hesitated watching it went cm after moment If you charge me with the murder theyll find out why Esther Greenberg came here theyll find out how Noel died
And theyll blame Diane you wouldnt want that Her clenched fist pounded on his chest
So youve got to give me chance
Ill do what can to help youI swear that
Ill make Diane marry you even if She grew breathless and her voice became almost inaudible
She turned away from John ny Connells eyes
Dont look at me that way
Johnny Connell said hoarsely his throat strained We can get rid of Esther Greenberg but we cant take your hus band out of here
So theyll have to find you with him
Thats the outthe only out for Diane With him She pushed hand back dazedly through her hair
cant see what you mean
What am going to tell the police Nothing Johnny Connell said
She was watching him stupidly
You can leave note and say you killed him and yourself because you couldnt stand the pain
Diane said you had bad heart
The police wont question suicide pact Ilis
right arm moved and the gun sailed through the air bounced on the couch
Her head turned slowly to look at it stopped there as if she were paralyzed
Johnny Connell said Theres bullet left She sat down on the couch her face grotesque astounded as if she couldnt understand his words
Standing by the door with one hand on the knob he turned once more as her voice broke hoarsely after him
If dont If you dont Johnny Connell said theres Esther Greenbergs slipper
This way its better than the chair
Youve got an hour He returned from Aberdeens at half past two
In the lobby he put through phone call to Suite holding the receiver to his ear until the operator told him that there was no answer
He asked her to try again listened for thirty sec onds more then put the instrument back on its shelf with his gray eyes colourless and dull
Upstairs on the ninth floor Nick opened the door of the room and behind him Johnny Connell could see Diane sit ting by the window her face lovely and pointed against the night outside her dark eyes glowing
She looked very hap py she smiled at him briefly but even while she did her eyes kept following Nick
Johnny Connell told her that thered been an accident that her mother and Ramon
Breathless with hand outstretched gropingly to Nick she ran out of the room and when he was alone Johnny Connell grinned stiffly at the floor
In the quietness presently he got up and moved around but that didnt help any
He still felt tired and as if nothing would ever matter much again
Kicker Dell whirled
Then Zeph was upon him
INDIAN THICK by Maxwell Hawkins To the hardlooking pair who drove up in the big car that night Zeph Kingdom was just another hick to be used and gotten rid of
They couldnt have known that in his veins flowed pioneer bloodand that in his bead still lurked few pioneer tricks
HE last cracker barrel orator the last sawdustspitter had gone home
Zeph Kingdom who ran Kingdoms General Store at Potterstown was get ting ready to dose up for the night
He had just placed his hand on the oldfashioned bolt of the front doors when car drew up in front
Zeph bent his long frame slightly put his face close to the grimy glass and peered out
He could tell by the distance between the headlights and the ruddy glow of the taillight that it was big car
Beyond that he could make out little
The sound of the car door opening came to his ears
Then man moving with rapid dedsive steps emerged from the gloom
He caught sight of Zephs fig ure silhouetted against the lights of the store
We want some gasl In hurry Zeph nodded and opened the door
reckon can fix you up He walked across the store to the coun ter
He was tall and gaunt with slight Dime Detective Magi stoop to his shoulders although only little past forty
His hair was thinning at the top of his forehead but over his temples it grew in sandy tufts that gave him an odd appearance
His face like his body was long and solemn
But his slategray eyes at times held shrewd twinkle
For more than twenty years Zeph Kingdom had run the store
His father had run it before him
And before that Zephs grandfather who had come out from New York State with his Conestoga wagon loaded with meager stock of merchandise
tough customer that first Kingdom to settle in Potterstown
He set up his store in log cabin he traded and fought with the Indians by turn
And although Zeph wasnt conscious of it some of his doughty ancestors iron will and resource fulness had been passed along to him
When he returned with flashlight his midnight customer had stepped inside
He was young not more than twenty five or six
His dark suit flared at the lapels was pinched in at the waist but it covered tall broadshouldered body
His soft hat shielded his eyes and Zeph could see only the lower part of his face
He had glimpse of thick nose with wide nostrils mouth that looked almost lipless
Standing at one side the customer let Zeph go out the door first
He followed close behind
Fill her up he said
Shes almost dry Zeph put the nozzle of the gas hose into the tank at the rear of the big sedan
How far to Grider Lake the strang er asked
Eighteen miles
Two miles beyond the forest rangers tower Good roads No Zeph replied
Bad fWhat do you mean by that All dirt
Rough Road marked Zeph laughed briefly
Mister he said dryly youre in the back country
Theres few signs
If they havent fallen down The stranger nodded slowly
His tight mouth lifted little at one corner as he digested this information
As Zeph swung his flashlight to look at the gauge on his gasoline pump Zeph got quick view of the interior of the car
woman was sitting in the front seat
In the rear was second man
He had moved to the far side and was talking through the open door to the big fellow who had ordered the gas
The gauge showed twenty gallons
Zeph stepped to the back of the sedan and lifting the nozzle of the hose from the tank flashed his light inside
The tank was full almost to the brim
His sharp ears caught voice from the far side of the car
Hellits the only out moment later the big stranger reap peared moved close to Zephs side while he screwed the tank cap bade on
Zeph straightened up
put in twenty gallons he said
Thats threesixty His customers reply was to glide be hind Zeph jam hard object in the small of his back
Listen hide he said his voice low and threatening youre cornin alongto show us the way EPH knew what that hard object against his spine was
He felt too that the big man who was pressing it there wouldnt hesitate touse it
And this sudden turn of affairs not only took him by surprise but gave him decidedly uncomfortable feeling
He gulped
Youyou mean you want me toto go along to Grider Lake Indian Trick You got good ears the man with the gun sneered
Come on He prodded Zeph to the far side of the sedan where the door was open
Gimme that flash Zeph held out the light and it was seized from behind
The big man snapped it on turned the beam inside the sedan
Get in back
Make it fast The girl who had been sitting in front didnt say anything
But she crawled over the seat to the back of the car
She was young with white face and big frightened eyes
Her blond hair cut in long bob was topped by hat that tilted at rakish angle
Get in hick the man with the gun ordered
And if you let out sound
Ill plug you Zeph climbed into the seat the girl had vacated
His captor turned to the man in back
Hurry up Kicker and bring the stuff
Dont forget some candles The man called Kicker got out the oth er side of the car and entered the store
He returned presently with his arms load ed with canned goods which he placed in back
He made half dozen trips each time with an armful of supplies
On his last trip he carried couple of coils of clothesline
Then Kicker put out the lights closed the store door and took his seat directly behind Zeph
You make just one funny move he growled wamingly and Ill blow the back of your head off The big man who had been keeping watch over Zeph slipped behind the wheel
The heavy car started forward with smooth powerful purr
Which way Straight ahead for nigh onto mile It was no time to argue Zeph realized
These two men were dangerous deadly
The only thing he could do was guide them to Grider Lakeand hope for the best
He soon discovered that the best threatened to be pretty bad
few miles out of Potterstown and the big man stopped the car
All right
Tie him up Kicker bound Zephs hands
He tied his ankles too with the clothesline
Not tightly just so as to hobble him if he tried to run
Then the sedan moved for ward again
Zeph was trying to figure out the situ ation
The fact that his captors had looted his store of supplies indicated that they planned to stay somewhere in this Grider Lake wilderness for several days at least
They were hiding out he was cer tain now hiding out from the law
And the thought caused him to wet his lips nervously with the tip of his tongue
Think theyll trace us
Jack Kicker asked the man at the wheel at one point Not chance They may identify Buds body
Fig ure we might lay out up here The big Jack sneered
Four hundred miles away
Listen boy cops aint that smart
Im tellin you this is the spot
If what Bud said was true At least hed learned something Zeph decided
The girl was Babe the drivers name was Jack and the man behind with the gun trained on the back of his head was Kicker
Bud whoever he was was apparently dead four hundred miles away
The name struck respon sive chord in Zephs memory
RIDER LAKE which covered about three square miles was on low ground its shore on two sides merging into the swamps
On the other two sides the land was higher and dry
Here half dozen camp cottages had been built at widely spaced intervals
Now however in late October they were all closed
Even though the springs of the big sedan ironed out some of the roughness of the rutted dirt road it had taken Zeph Dime Detective Magazine and his captors almost an hoar to reach the lake
It was dismal sight Hie head lights illuminated
Thickets of alders willows and in the background funereal pines
Theres the lake Zeph said
Big Jack nodded indifferently
Lis ten hick he said do you know where the Chehnan farm is Instantly Zeph understood why the name Bud had sounded familiarly in his ears in connection with this trip to Grider Lake
Its about mile up this shore
Aint nobody there now though
Aint been since old man Chelman died
His boys in the pen he added
His boys in hell fella Kicker said dryly
That clinched it for Zeph
The Bud theyd referred to was Bud Chelman
And that accounted for the presence of these two men and their girl in the back country
Theres no one there Zeph repeated
The houses about falling down
No body wants to buy it We didnt come up here to buy Big Jack growled
Which way do we go to get there Youll find road leading off to the right about ten rods or so ahead It was barely discernible route they followed the wheel tracks were almost erased dried and matted weeds choked the center
The girl whined softly and Big Jack cursed her told her to shut up
She fell silent
They all were silent
At last the trees and shrubbery began to thin out
Suddenly the road emerged into large clearing
Directly ahead was the farmhouse
It was onestory structure small with peaked roof
The door was dosed
But on either side of the door were gap ing windows
They were dark now
Thats it Zeph said
Thats the Chehnan farmhouse
The property lines right here
To hell with the property line Big Jack snarled
It was plain that the eerie surroundings were putting his nerves on edge
He drove the sedan almost up to the door before he stopped
When he did he sat for moment contemplating the building
The paint was almost gone
Only few panes of glass were left in the two windows
What had once been stoop was rotted and leaning at crazy angle
Kicker spoke
What dump to drive four hundred miles for
Big Jack grumbled agreement
Wait here he muttered
He got out walked to the door and tried it
It was fastened but he pushed against it with his shoulder and it gave readily
He entered
They could see the ray of his flashlight as he went from room to room
In few minutes he came back to the car
Its hell of hideout he snarled
But we gotta make it do for few days
Till things cool off
Well get the hick parked first
Then we can lug the stuff in He opened the door alongside Zeph
Get out
he ordered
Zeph hobbled from his seat to the ground
Kicker got out too and he and Big Jack took Zeph into the house
It had four rooms
They put him in one of the back rooms which had once been the kitchen and Kicker tied the rope tightly about his ankles
Then they stretched him on the dirty floor near the wall
As they Heft he heard Kicker say Why bother with him
Lets get him out of the way now Naw Big Jade growled
got an idea
TEFGRE he had been ordered out of the car Zeph had noticed the clock Indian Trick on the dash
The hands stood at one fifteen
There was no moon but the sky was clear and the stars brilliant in the autumn sky gave cold feeble light
Looking up from the floor now Zeph could glimpse this chill radiance through the window above him
He heard his captors moving about in the front of the house
The mumbling of their voices fell upon his ears
door closed and then the footsteps ceased
The low rumble of conversation still continued punctuated occasionally by higher voice
The girl
Zeph tried his bonds
They had been expertly fastened and he soon decided it was waste of strength to strain against them
So he made himself as comfortable as he could on the hard floor and tried to think things out
What were these men and their blond girl fleeing from
He guessed it must have been some kind of robbery
And evidently Bud Chelman had been one of them
But Bud Chelman had been killed
They had planned to hide out up here and after young Chelmans death they hadnt been able to find it without help
That was why theyd forced Zeph along
But always the question burned through his brainwhat were they going to do with him
The man called Jack had said he had an idea
The way he had said it had been ominous
Zeph had spent all his life in Potterstown and the Grider Lake country
But he knew men knew human nature
He saw his captors clear ly for what they were
Gradually the sound of voices dimin ished
Then it ceased entirely
Zeph figured an hour must have passed before all grew still in the front room
Another hour passed he estimated
That would make it quarter past three
But at this time of year it wouldnt begin to grow light for several hours more
And then he became aware that door was opening
few seconds later the ancient rotten floorboards gave faint creak
Was it only his nerves beginning to play tricks on him
His doubt ended when low guarded whisper came to him
Where are you It was the yellowhaired girl
He swallowed quickly
His throat was dry and he didnt want his voice to boom out Herealmost under the window he said softly
There was silence then for long time
Once more the floor creaked faintly this time close behind him
Careful he whispered
Im right in front of you Her groping hands found him passed over his face and shoulders
She leaned close till he could feel her breath on his cheek
Im gonna help you mister
But for Gods sake you gotta help me too GAIN Zeph made sure of his voice before he replied
Then he whispered slowly Ill do anything can
But cant do anything tied up like this Ill bring knife
But do you know how to get away from here
On foot know every inch of this country Youll take me with you Yes II gotta get away Whats the matter She moved even closer
Listen mis ter
got mixed up with Jack before knew what he was
Down in Indiana
Then he wouldnt let me go Whywhy not know too much Whats he going to do then She began to breathe more rapidly
My God dont you understand
There was another girl before me
He got tired of her too
Nobodys ever found out what became of her Dime Detective Magazine Youyou mean mean he kilted her Her fingers dug into his arm
But that dpvil hasnt got me footed
He doesnt intend to take me away from here
Now do you under stand Zeph was aghast
reckon do Shh Once more he fdt her fingers pressing into his arm
They waited in silence silence heavy with menace of an unseen peril
He could fed her hand trembling
Hed heard nothing but evidently her ears had caught some warning sound
For long time they waited in the ghastly blackness
Nothing happened
II must have been mistaken she whispered nervously
They were both asleep when left She paused mo ment then went on Youre safefor little while
They think if things get hot and they have to make getaway through the woods theyll force you to guide them
Do you see
Yes But youll never leave them alive Whowho are they
Zeph asked
My God dont you know
Jack Kil lifer and Kicker Dell And in that second Zephs fears for his life crystalized into dead certainty
Jack Killifer wholesale murderer the bandit who always fired on sight Jack Killifer wanted in dozen states hunted by hundreds of law officers
Wed better hurry miss Zeph whis pered
Get that knife wanted to be suresure you would nt leave me she said
IU She got no further
dazzling white beam stabbed through the darkness
Like spotlight picking out the principals on stage its white circle revealed the kneeling girl the man stretched upon the dirty floor
You doublecrossing hellcat Killifers voice choked with rage
He strode across the room seized the girl by her hair and jerked her to her feet Then he began to shake her
Dontdont she screamed her voice rattling in her throat
Suddenly he ceased to shake her
Go ing to let him go were you he said more calmly
But his calmness seemed even more threatening than his anger
Honest wasnt
Jack She was crying now
felt sorry for him
only came in toto see if he wanted drink Youre lying The words came through set teeth
Again he grabbed her shoulder
He shoved her violently before him into the other room
The door was slammed
An instant later from beyond that closed portal her voice rang out in shrill agonized shriek of terror
As sud denly as it had broken out it stopped
There was moment of ghastly si lence followed by dull thud
FEW minutes later the door was opened again
From his place on the floor Zeph could see that the other room was lighted and he recalled that Big Jack had told Kicker to bring candles from the store
Zeph moved onto his side so he could see better
In the orange rectangle of the door towering black figure was out lined for moment
Then Jack Killifer flashlight in hand strode up to the man on the floor
He rolled Zeph over on his face and examined the clothesline bonds on his wrists then his ankles
Apparent ly satisfied he straightened up
Now maybe can get some sleep he growled and strode from the room
Zeph tried to picture what had hap pened behind that dosed door only few Indian Trick minutes before
With shudder he came to the conclusion that Killifer in his blind rage had strangled the girl with the yel low hair
That shriek of terror still echoed in Zephs ears
The girl had told him that he was in no immediate danger because these two killers hoped to use him as guide if it should became necessary to take to the woods
But he couldnt count on that
And he realized also that there was slim chance that the girl with the yellow hair had not been killed yet
If she was still alive something had to be done to save her
He pressed his teeth together until his jaws ached
His utter helpless ness was agonizing
He had to get rid of his bonds he told himself over and over
And he lay there on the floor his mind groping frantically for some possible means of accomplishing this
By pushing with his bound hands he finally managed to jerk up to sitting position
That was help
He could now look out the window with its broken panes
Not more than third of the glass was left
Gradually thoughtful smile crossed his long face
One eyebrow lifted almost imperceptibly he nodded slowly as if to confirm the idea that had flashed into his head
Inch by inch he wriggled to the wall to the window
By stretching he was just able to reach the sill
He hooked his chin over it
He pulled himself slowly up got his forehead onto the sill and gave quick push
He was on his feet
Leaning forward he examined the window as well as he could in the dim Hght
Then by rocking from heel to toe he moved across the short distance and backed up to the broken panes
He bent backward shoved out his bound wrists as far as possiMe
Finally he found what he neededa splinter of glass that still stuck in the frame
Slowly and painfully he began to saw the rope against it
He stopped often to listen
But no sound came from the front room
He cut himself again and again he could feel the warm blood on his palms
At last Zeph detected that the soft rope was yielding
moment later he had freed his hands
Swiftly he bent over and removed the bonds from his ankles
He stretched his cramped limbs to re store circulation wiped the blood away with his handkerchief
tiptoe Zeph crossed the kitchen to the door leading to the front room
He placed his ear close to the panel and listened
From beyond came faint snor ing mingled with heavy breathing
Zeph smiled to himself
His captors exhausted from their long drive were sleeping
It would be easy now for him to make his escape he realized
Yet he gave that scarcely passing thought
It was not in his nature to retreat when he had chance to capture the enemy
And there was the girl
Perhaps she was already beyond any help but until he was certain of her death he meant to use every means in his power to save her
He recrossed the kitchen slowly opened the back door
Outside he paused to look around for few seconds
It was grow ing lighter
Hed have to work fast
Circling the house at some distance he reached the big sedan parked at the front
Carefully he raised the hood that covered the powerful engine
In the deep shadow which enveloped it he could see nothing but his groping fingers found wire and he gave it jerk
One by one he removed half dozen sections of the ignition cable
Then he lowered the hood into place again
Retracing his steps Zeph passed the Dime Detective Magazine rear of the tumbledown farmhouse kept going
From time to time he hurled one of the pieces of wire into the underbrush
Temporarily at least he had blocked any swift dash for freedom by automobile
As soon as he had put considerable distance between himself and the house Zeph increased his pace
He headed down the narrow weedchoked lane by which they had arrived few hours earlier
Half mile down he angled off from the roadway into the underbrush
little farther and the trees and ground growth thinned out into small rocky clearing
Zeph smiled grimly
He hadnt forgot ten the lay of the land around Grider Lake
Briskly he set to work
The light was increasing rapidly as he set about gather ing pile of dried branches
When he had enough he stooped low and presently was fanning tiny blaze into life
He added fuel until he had sizable fire then made his way into the surrounding thickets and returned with an armful of green twigs
These he added to the flames
As the fire swiftly turned into heavy smudge he stood watching it for few moments
He nodded an expression of satisfaction on his lean face as the smoke climbed upward in the still air
From his pocket he took out his hand kerchief stained with blood from his lacerated wrists which he fastened to sapling near the smoky fire
Something else went with the handkerchief little later
And then he glided from the clear ing back into the woods and headed to ward the farmhouse where Killifer and Dell were sleeping
Concealed behind thick clump of un derbrush Zeph looked across the open field toward the dilapidated structure
It was daylight now and he could see the place plainly
There were no signs of life about it as yet
The killers must still be sleeping
EPH squatted on his heels
He was ready to watch and wait with the patience of the Indians who had once roamed this timbered wilderness
His first impulse on slipping his bonds had been to go for help
But if he went for help there was the possibility that either Killifer or Dell might wake up go into the kitchen dis cover he had escaped
In that case Zeph figured theyd lose no time making getaway
When they found their car had been put out of commission theyd probably take to the woods on foot
Zeph wasnt enough of woodsman to follow trail of that kind
Hardly anybody could
If Jack Killifer and Kicker Dell were to be captured and their murderous careers brought to an end he couldnt let them out of his sight
That was why Zeph squatted there in the underbrush that was why he fre quently turned and gazed with thoughtful eyes back toward the spot where he had built the fire
The sun climbed higher
Still there was no sign of life in the crumbling building across the clearing
The smoke from his fire no longer mounted toward the sky and Zeph estimated that he had been waiting there in the brush for couple of hours
He was about to shift his position and relieve his cramped muscles when sud den shrill cry broke upon the morning air
At the same instant figure burst from the front door of the farmhouse
It was the yellowhaired girl
She stumbled over the stoop started running across the open field toward the woods
And the huge Killifer was close behind her
Then she tripped sprawled forward with arms flung wide
Instantly Indian Trick Killifer was upon her
He yanked her upright
She screamed frenzied blood chilling sound filled with stark fear
Dont kill me
didnt help him get away
For Gods sake Jack Killifers fist cut off her frantic pleas
It caught her on the side of her head and again she went tumbling into the dirt and stubble of the field pitiful crumpled heap on the brown ground
Zeph started forward his eyes blazing with rage
But suddenly he halted glided swiftly behind concealing tree trunk
Kicker Dell pistol in hand had ap peared from the house and was standing on the stoop
He ran toward Killifer who was lifting the limp form of the yellow haired Babe
Wed better get the hell out of here Kicker cried
Yeah How about her Well take her along Killifer growl ed
aint done with her yet
You get our stuff together and Ill get the bus started Kicker Dell nodded turned and hurried back towards the farmhouse
Killifer carrying the unconscious girl made for the sedan
grim smile twisted Zephs mouth with clenched hands he backed into the woods until he was sure he could not be seen
Then he slipped through the brush as fast as he could go
circled the clearing till he was at the rear of the house
Casting caution aside he dashed to the back door
Noiselessly he stepped into the kitchen
The door to the front room was open and he saw Kicker Dell bend ing over suitcase which he was closing
His gun lay on the floor beside him
Slowly and silently Zeph eased for ward to the doorway into the front room
And as he stepped across the sill the ancient floorboards creaked
THICKER DELL straightened up and whirled in single movement
And then Zeph was upon him
tangled mass of arms and legs they crashed to the floor
Over and over the two men rolled
Kickers hand found Zephs face the fingers clutched for his eyes
But only for brief moment
Zeph twisted side ways brought his knee up and sent the cursing panting Kicker hurtling from him
Outside car door slammed
Zeph scrambled to his feet
Kicker was only on his knees when Zeph pounced upon him again
The tall mans arms shot around Kickers body beneath the armpits and before the killer realized what was happening he was pulled upright
As Killifer gun in each hand burst through the doorway Zeph had drawn Kicker close to him
Killifers guns came up but he hesitated
His pal was an un willing and cursing shield between those ugly weapons and their target
The big killers face turned livid with rage
His eyes became shot with blood and the nostrils of his thick nose quivered
Zeph Kingdom knew then that he was looking into the face of man gone mad with lust for blood
Killifers hands moved ever so slightly
There was deafening roar
Both guns vomited forth their lethal slugs
The im pact sent Zeph and his human shield stag gering backwards then to the floor
Without waiting to see the effect of his shots Killifer leaped out the doorway into the farmyard
Vaguely Zeph was conscious of shouts
And as his head cleared he realized that somebody was shootinga lot of people must be shooting
It sounded like battle
He dragged himself from beneath the limp figure he had been pressing to him even as he fell
In daze he stood up stared at his hands
They were red hideous bloody red
He looked down
In Dime Detective Magazine Kicker Dells stomach was great gaping hole
Zeph swayed dizzily
He ran the back of his hand across his face and it left gory streak
He took step and almost collapsed
And then he knew that one of the slugs that ripped into the body of Kicker Dell had passed on through into his own groin
With an effort Zeph reached the door way
There he paused supporting himself against the frame
He looked out into the farmyard
Fifty feet away was still figure stretched upon the ground the lifeless fingers clutching pair of guns
Several men were standing over him
They stared at Zeph for moment
One of them ran toward him and Zeph recog nized Ed Colvin the sheriff
Is he dead Zeph asked
The sheriff nodded
We blew him to hell
He wouldnt stop Zeph noticed with faint smile that one of the men was wearing the uniform of forest ranger
Theres girl in the car Zeph said
Youd better see how she is He limped out into the farmyard
The forest ranger and one of the other men hurried to him and took his arm
Ed Colvin ran to the sedan and jerked the door open
You got my note seethe one left in the bloody handkerchief Zeph said to the ranger
thought you would Ben Ben nodded The first thing saw this morning was lot of smoke over here near the lake
didnt lose any time in vestigating counted on that Zeph said
But there was chance you wouldnt see the handkerchief Not me Ben answered
And when read what youd writtenthat Killifer and Dell were hiding here and you were standing watch on emI phoned the sheriff from the tower
He brought his gang Just in time Zeph murmured
The sheriff came up
The girls Listen Zeph Ben asked suddenly what the dickens made you think of building that smudge You mean mysmoke signal Zeph asked with funny sort of smile
Sure reckon youll have to give old Grandpa Kingdom credit for that The sheriff looked puzzled
Why Zeph your grandpas been dead thirty years Yep
But when was kid he used to tell me about the Indians lot Zeph said softly
So guess just naturally thought of an Indian trick when needed one GUN ANGLES OUR APOLOCIESt We had all ready for you sheaf of redhot dope on certain much disputed points regarding guns and their use sent us by two of our authors who know what theyre talking about
But when the issue went to press so crammedfull was it of stories that there was no room for GUN ANGLES
We were confident that every one of the seven yarns in this issue was knockout and felt that youd rather have the stories than the department
So we left it outnot for good but until the next issue

THE CUBIC CITY By Louis Tucker THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS By Frank Phillips THE RADIUM POOL story in two parts Part II By Ed Earl Repp THE PROBLEMS OF SPACE FLYING Conclusion By Capt Hermann Noordung AD WHAT IS YOUR SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE
Science Questionnaire SCIENCE NEWS OF THE MONTH THE READER SPEAKS Letters from Our Readers ON THE COVER this month is illustrated Mr Frank Phillips story The Onslaught from Venus
Here we see the gigantic digging machines of the Venus People in operation while in the background one of their heat machines is turning out molten lava made from rock and earth and which later will be used to make building blocks for these invaders
As observed the digging machines with almost human accuracy carry the lava away
NEXT MONTH THE METAL WORLD
By Ed Earl Repp
The author of The Radium Pool has come forward with his latest offering written in style sure to arouse your enthusiasm
It has often been said by our foremost scientists that life is possible under the most adverse conditions
Seemingly the human race finds it
pos sible to propagate as easily in the North Polar regions as under the broiling sun of the Equator
On the other hand the human race can endure at some of our highest mountain tops where the lack of air is notable and humans can exist deep caves for years without being the worse for it
Dont fail to read this story
FROM EROS TO EARTH
By Walter Kateley
The author of this story was formerly connected with the patent office and is for that reason well qualified as science fiction writer
He has given us most excellent interplanetarian story of differ ent sort
Not all interplanetarian stories have to do with space flyers and the visiting of other planets by earth men
This story is one that deals with new and novel theme one that will hold your interest due to its captivating charm as well as its unusual array of scientific ideas
THE ANCIENT BRAIN
By Stangland
That the idea of suspended animation is not mere fiction is best proved by the fact that you can take fish and other animals and freeze them solid and keep them in this condition for considerable length of time
After thawing they seem to be as welloff as before
Other animals notably bears can hibernate during the entire winter months without being the worse for it
Mr Stangland has enlarged on this theme in most surprising manner and inci dentally has created rattling good story that cannot help but keep your intense interest
IN TWO WORLDS
By Edward Chappelow
Here is one of the most daring stdries of imagination that we have read in long while
It is one of those stories that grows upon you as time goes on
It not only gives you world of information on subject of which not too much is known even by our foremost scientists but provides source of the most interesting specula tion about the possibility of there existing worlds within worlds ad infinitum
We then may well wonder what part of the scheme our world consists of

HIDDEN WONDERS By HUGO GERNSBACK greatest sources of wonder are not those that we see or those indeed we know but those which are hidden from us and are going to be known only as we progress on our long and tortuous road to the future
If we contemplate the world as it was let us say years ago in the day of the caveman this truth must beoome most apparent to us yet it is often overlooked or not at all appreci Every manmade work from the modern skyscraper down to the most intricate chronometer that we have today was existence years ago in its integral parts
All the raw materials were there as they are today
Nothing has been added to the wealth of the earth during the last years with the possible exception of some falling meteorites
Yet humanity at that time was nothing more than race of animals emerging from long sojourn in savagery
Every thing that spells our civilization today was hidden from our ancestors
It safe to presume that it will always be thus and that we who call ourselves moderns of today have hidden from us just as many things as our ancestors had hidden from them years ago
It is true that in the last ISO years more things have been revealed to the human race than in years preceding this epoch but even now we have as yet not scratched the surface of the possibilities of nature or come anywhere near the limit of our progress
There are immeasurable treasures surrounding us treasures in power treasures in foodstuffs and other treasures necessary for lifebut we do not use them because we do not know how to get at them
As late as hundred years ago people in England as well as Pennsylvania were burning wood in the winter to keep warm because they had always done so yet they built their houses right on top of coal veins which they assumed to be only form of rock
It took humanity over years to arrive at the point where it burned this rock and found it would give them heat
This of course sounds ludicrous to us today yet we are just as foolish when we insist we must burn coal in order to make steam of it which in turn is used to run our turbines which turn dynamos which produce the current to light our electric lamps
In this process we lose exactly of the available power and only of of the energy is turned into light the rest escapes in heat and other losses
Untold sources of power are lying right at our own door but as yet we are unaware of it
If we had the key to unlock the secret of atomic power for instance every single pebble in your backyard could be turned into enough heat light and power to keep your house supplied for years to come
But of course we havent got the key because as yet it is hidden from us
Yet we need not go as far as atomic power
There are prob ably and scientists have suspected this for many years jnany other sources of power surrounding us which as yet have not been harnessed
There is for instance gravitation there is the pressure of light there is the electric energy that comes direct to us from the sun in addition to the radiant heat vast source of power as yet only little understood
It takes generations of steady plodding to discover some of these hidden sources of power
One for instance that probably will become tremendous factor in the future the socalled cosmic ray was recently discovered by Professor Milliken
We know practically nothing about it as yet but from the little we have seen we suspect it is terrific power that some day will be tapped to the benefit of humanity
The sources of energy created by the differences in tempera ture around us have never been tapped
Only recently French man proposed most unique plan whereby tremendous amount of power can be taken from the oceans through simply taking advantage of small variation of temperature existing between that of the sea level and that little distance below the surface
Then there are the tremendous sources of solar heat the tides winds and others which although they are known to us might just as well be hidden away because wo have as yet not the sense to make use of them
Yet each of them offers enough power to supply all the needs for the entire planet
Fabulous wealth will be made in the coming generations by those who will tap some of these hidden or unused sources of power and add them to our natural resources without ever fearing in the least to deplete the source
Coal and oil for in stance will some day give out whereas the solar heat the tides radiant heat and other forces will keep on giving energy for literally millions of years to come

Now could see the life lived there and hear it too and obtain the harmony between sight and sound
THE HUMAN TERMITES FOREWORD the latter part of April during visit to New York was entertained tae evening by Mr and Mrs Hugo Gernsback
They had done me the honor of having me to dinner in their home instead of the more formal surroundings of one of the great Metropolitan hotels
After dinner the three of us dis cussed various phases of social life in New York
admitted that the city had its charms but that personally should not care to live amid the constant din and con fusion
Mr Gernsback laughed at me as he said But you should come to see us more frequently
Everytime you come you secure ideas for several stories admit that replied
For example large blocks of conversation in Stenographer Hands were ob tained from your conversation
At the same time you must admit that some of the ideas in my stories are original
The hard thing is to get new idea
Just one absolutely ori ginal idea makes story possible My host pond ered for moment and then walked over to his library and picked up book
Here he is an idea for story
This book is The White Ant by Maurice Maeterlinck
He tells about the ter mite and suggests that the conduct of the individual ant may be con trolled by cen tral intelligence and that the mitary is one large animal
Gernsback halfseriously then suggested that all life may be way and that human being may be controlled by central intelli gence
He felt that this may count for the that individuals in different parts of the world often do the same thing at almost the same Much of what we are in life and the greater part of what we do is made possible by the previous efforts of some worker who may have all un knowingly laid the foundations for our achievements
It is therefore with due appreciation that this work of sciencefiction is dedicated to Mau rice Maeterlinck author of The White Ant David Keller MD
For example he went on Elisha Gray and Alexander Gra ham Bell working independently arrived simultaneously at the idea of the telephone and submitted the invention to the patent office with in an hour of each other
Darwin and Charles Buell announced from different parts of the globe their conclusions regarding natural selec tion at practically the same time
Let me read parts of this book to you For fifteen minutes he read to me while sat in an easy chair with closed eyes
Finally he said You take this book with you and read it
There is big story in it
give you one idea
All you have to do is to work out the details Yes replied that is ALL but that is good deal some times ready for the typewriter
It was written at white heat and fin ished in less than two weeks
Mr Gernsback was kind enough to say that it was my best science fiction story
But he quite naturally be lieves that it could not have been written without his idea
Editors that way nfortu nately true
And am conceited enough to feel that even with the idea he needed me to write story
Dr Keller infers that the Editor could never have written The Human Ter mites even though he had the idea
The Editor cheer fully admits this
As matter of fact few authors could have written such marvelous story as Dr Keller has Editor
This at least is the way one story came to be written
David Keller MX
book which inspired The Human Termites SCIENCE WONDER STORIES ANS SOUDERMAN had just returned from residence of many years in Africa
There he had lived the solitary life of one who is occupied in solving certain mystery of life and cannot be content with any other occupation or satisfied till solution of the problem has been at tained
Such men have made our civilization pos sible they are not good companions on account of their intense introversion but on the rare occasions when they can be induced to talk about their work they are always able to astonish their audience with their erudition and complete mastery of their life work
Such man was Souderman
For some reason early in life he had been stimulated to entomo logical research
For years he had followed in the footsteps of Forel Charles Janet Lubbock Was mann and Maeterlinck
He had learned all that these masters of insect life had to teach him but because he was born of woman he was not satisfied with this knowledge
There were too many gaps in the knowledge of his teachers too many places where they said do not know He realized that he could not fill all of these gaps unravel the twisted thread of all the mysteries of insect life that had puzzled them but he did feel that life was going to be failure to him and completely unsatisfac tory unless he made at least one contribu tion to the knowledge of the insect world
The work of Forel and Maeterlinck intrigued him but left him rest less unsatisfied and discontented
He want ed to find one fact that was unknown to them solve one puzzle that they had been unable to fathom
It is typical of the man that he made calm and dispassionate survey of the entire world of insects before he decided on his life work
This review of the unsolved questions of the littleknown part of life formed by the insects brought him face to face with the Termite and its de structive powers
In the Annals of Ento mology he read of the destruction of the French town of La Rochelle by termites from San Domingo which had come in the vegetable mould in the hold of sailing vessels
Every street was at tacked
Before the danger was realized most of the houses fell down
The archives and all the records were destroyed
The devastation only stopped when the termites reached the canal of La Verriere
In Spanish warship was literally eaten to pieces by swarm of termite divers while an chored in the harbor of Ferro
In these same minute insects destroyed the batteries and munition of the French forts in the Antilles and made the defence of those islands against the English an im possibility
Souderman found that large portions of Australia and Ceylon were uninhabitable because the termites ate the crops faster than they could be grown
Europe was protected by its temperature were it tropical land the termite might destroy even the greatest of the cities of that land
They have to live in temperature ranging from to degrees Centigrade
Below degrees they die
The more Souder man read about these tiny blind insects the more fascinated be was by the many startling peculiarities they pos sessed
He no longer felt the bee the wasp and the ant were the intellectual leaders of the insect world but slowly came to realize that the termite pos sessed something re sembling human rea son which placed it not on level with man but perhaps in some ways above him
So he decided to de vote the rest of his life to study of the ter mite
Severing all re lations with his Euro pean associates secur ing an income from one of the large re search endowment funds he went to South Africa to study the termites not by observ ing them but by ac tually living with them
This is form of scien tific investigation that is rare but which never fails to repay for the years spent in its pur suit
Some day all the TJE take pleasure in presenting what we be rr lieve to be Dr Kellers greatest work so far
That this story will cause furore and endless discussion seems certain
It embraces tremend ous subject and incidentally enters into realms that are as yet but little understood even by our foremost scientists
But you may be sure that some of the greatest mysteries that surround us and even permeate our very bodies will be solved during the next few hundred years
For instance as Maeterlinck asks in his book The White Ant what intelli gence governs our own bodies
You cut your finger and the ignorant person will say that it starts healing at once
But the process of healing means that the instant the breach is made in the skin innumerable thousands of mi nute white bodies called corpuscles immediately rush to the breach and start fighting the germs that enter the opening while new cells are being built up immediately to close the breach
Neither the human intelligence nor the human will has anything to do with these processes which go on at all times within the human body
All we know is that some intelligence evidently directs these things but who or what this intelli gence is no one knows
Whether it is our little understood socalled soul or something else no owe knows
Indeed it is not at all impossible that the mem bers of the entire human race must be considered simply as separate cells of great organism
They have no will of their own but are fused into homogeneous body with nothing but intervening air to separate
That this may be true could be illustrated in many ways
War for instance will quite often change an entire nation overnight as if by magic and also change lifetime habits and ideals of its people almost as quickly
Religion fanaticism and other passions are similar evidences of the transmission through an entire nation or nations in many instances of ideas without visible com munication between individuals
All these things may be explained by purely logical natural reasoning without resorting to the supernatural as indeed the author has pointed out in this memorable work
It is certainly work that will commend itself to the earnest at tention of every thinking questioning person
THE HUMAN TERMITES questions in the scientific world will be solved by such men as Souderman trained laborers in the world of the unknown who are willing to sacrifice everything to obtain an answer to one mystery of life
Something About Souderman UCH workers have been few
The price that has to be paid is too great
Everything has to be abandoned
lifetime has to be spent to attain one little fact
And yet the men who do this feel that the attainment of one addition to the store of human knowledge is sufficient reward for all their sacrifice
And it is
Suppose one man spent life time with the cancer cell not merely studying it but actually living with it
He would think of nothing else during his waking hours and dream only of it during his sleep
Month by month and year by year he would become more intimate with this enemy of the middleaged
To him the can cer cell would become separate race of living crea tures parasitic enemy of mankind
He would learn its history its folklore its traditions
The cancer race would slowly reward his efforts by allowing him few glimpses of separate intelli gence comparable to that of the human species
Time would pass and it might be that old age would come on and still the secret of prevention would remain mystery
As last resort he would deliberately inoculate himself with the can cer cell make of his own body laboratory so that he could make last final effort to gain an insight into the soul of the individual cell the group in telligence of the cancer mass
Others would con sider him insane recluse introverted by the study of years an unfortunate dying of the very disease he had spent years to study
Yet even on his death bed he might whisper the great truth which would make the human race free from this parasite that now kills one out of every four who reach the age of forty
Surely this man would die happy in the thought that he had contributed one fact that would make the life of his race happier
That is the great sacrifice
Every generation produces one voluntary victim
Such man was Souderman
He went to Africa when he was
He came back when he was
During those years his loved ones in Germany had died most of the scientists he had grown up with were solving the puzzles of an other world
Saddened by the realization of the changes in his social life still horrified at the final revelations of his African studies he decided to go to New York and there place the results of these years of sacrifice in kindly hands before his death made it too late
He was not satisfied with the definite knowledge he had secured in Africa for he realized that it would be useless unless he made it available to the betterment of the human race
For when the final truth had dawned upon him it had made him afraid
Fear is not necessarily an attribute of ignorance
The greater mans knowledge the more intense may be his fear not the blinding fear that shows in the panic of the submerged masses but the keen appreciative intelligent foreseeing fear of the scientist who combines that emotion with an in tense desire to prevent threatened calamity
And because of this intelligent fear mankind has checked the Black Plague reduced the incident of Yellow Fever and made Smallpox no longer scourge that could kill one out of every three of the population in less than year
Souderman knew that he could not die till he communicated this fear and the facts behind it to few scientists who could appreciate the terror of it
The knowledge had to be the common property of small group of men who would be willing to guard it terrific secret through the generations till the time came for action
Then and then only could the antidote be used the means of defense slowly perfected
And perhaps unknown to the masses once again human life on this globe would be saved through the sacrifice of many generations of unsung and unwept scientists
The student of termites came to New York
He then visited Chicago and Philadelphia
His record his knowledge made him welcomed guest in the homes of all those who worship at the feet of Minerva the Goddess of Wisdom
The German scientist talked little listened intently and observed much
Finally he found one man who had the peculiar mental qualities and the scientific founda tion and vision necessary for an accurate apprecia tion of what Souderman had to tell him
This man had youth enthusiasm and an excellent edu cation
In addition he had respect for the aged
The old man at times wished that the course of his life had made it possible for him to have son like that
Subconsciously he adopted him
Having finally found his man he spent few months in becoming acquainted with him in learn ing his mental reactions to the great events of life
He wanted to leave this man all the knowledge ac cumulated in those long years of African residence but he did not want to make any mistakes
He had secret to tell but in order to make that secret safe he had to know just how to tell it and in order to learn how to do this he had to study the per sonality of this youngster who was to become not only his pupil but finally his heir
Adam Fry is interesting to note that there were many men in America who were more brilliant than Adam Fry
There were scientists who had for gotten more than this young man knew
But Adam Fry had one trait that Souderman considered neces sary for the complete understanding of his secret and that was imagination
That was trait that many scientists lacked in fact most students of the world felt that imagination had no part in their life work
Yet Souderman had developed his imagination and by means of it had come to at least partial understanding of one of the worlds SCIENCE WONDER STORIES greatest secrets
And he felt that unless his heir possessed the same peculiar mental trait he would not listen to what might seem the ravings of an old man
He wanted man with the combination of Galileo and the farseeing vision of Jules Verne scientist who understood insect life as Fabre and Maeterlinck did and yet had the imagination of Wells Poe or Gernsback
In Adam Fry he believed that he had one of these peculiarly combined per sonalities
At least he was sure that the young man would understand
And that was why Souderman had been worried until the day he met Adam Fry
He wanted scientist man given to imagination and at the same time man who would understand the half truths half dreams of an old man
He had lived so long an introverted shutin life among the termites that he was sensitive of criticism could not stand disbelief and ridicule
He bad come to America to find man and in few days after meeting Adam Fry he knew that his search was ended
The reactions of Adam Fry to the older man were all pleasant
In singular way he had al ways been accustomed to respect age and the mere sight of this wornout shriveled old man who had spent lifetime in isolation awoke an intense pity and even love in the young scientist
He felt that this man knew something and to the youngster all knowledge was sacred
He desired nothing more than to learn what this whitehaired man bad to teach and regretted that his comparative poverty made it impossible for him to spend few days or week with him
With these thoughts it was gratifying shock to learn that the old man had money and was anxious to adopt him as student for the rest of his life
All of Frys financial worries could cease and he was to be paid an adequate salary to do nothing but listen day after day to Souderman and from time to time write complete statement of the conversation
This statement was to be put on pure linen paper with indelible ink that would last for ages and two copies made one for the Congressional Library in Washington and one for the Public Library in the City of New York
They were only to be accessible to members of the American Academy of Natural Sciences
Adam Fry listened to the plan proposed by Souderman and at once resigned his position as chemist in the BugTox laboratory
The two men decided to rent small apartment overlooking Riverside Drive do their own housework and cook ing and with the exception of regular hours spent in necessary exercise in Central Park to devote their entire time to the completion of this manu script
Souderman did not feel that he was in the best of health
He did not fear death but he did dread the thought of dying before his lifes work was securely placed on paper and burned into the mind of his pupil
Hans Souderman was so impatient to begin his story that he could hardly wait till they were in stalled in their apartment
He had impressed on his adopted son for so he was fond of considering him the necessity of having permanent ink
They also decided not to cover more ground each day than could be written twice before the beginning of the next days talk
Adam Fry trained as he was through years of scientific work to take notes made beautiful task of assembling and arranging in logical sequence the old mans conversation which at times was rather rambling and disconnected
The completed manuscript can be examined by any one who cares to take the trouble to do so though it tells only part of the complete and final story resulting from the work of years of patient toil completed by Souderman in Africa
CHAPTER II Soudermans Story HE story as told the young man by Souder man during these daily conversations ar ranged in some order and avoiding repetitions was about as follows In order for you to fully understand the end of my work Adam you will have to listen while tell you something about the beginning of it
Per haps you know something about it
If you do you are indeed an exceptional young man
went to Africa many years ago to study the termites
Many people think that they are ants and their common name is the White Ant but they are very different from the ant
It is not hymenopterous and there fore has no close relation to the ant and the bee
It is usually classified in the order of orthoptera orthopteraid newroptera neuroptera or pseudoneu roptera of the division Corrodentia
Some consider it an entirely separate class and term them the Isoptera
There are probably from to distinct species but probably not more than three hundred had been identified and properly labelled
have the honor of isolating more species than any other one man but why not when have spent my life living with them
They are very old
One hundred and fifty species have been found in fossil amber
Go back million years and there were the termites
Go back to the endless night of the Primary and there is the termite associated with the Protoblattidae
Some men have placed their beginning one hundred million years before man appeared on this globe
Surely very respectable age
During all this time they have lived and through these countless ages they have adapted themselves to their surroundings and necessities
Otherwise they could not have survived
Man supposed to be most intelligent creature has just begun to learn few of the things that the white ant has been doing for millions of years
But they are able to live efficiently in many ways which we are ignorant of and yet though the knowledge might be bene ficial to us so far we have been unable to learn the secrets of their lives and apply this knowledge to our own
Doomed to existence in darkness they have adjusted themselves to the life of the blind
With THE HUMAN TERMITES out defensive armour weak pitiful little things they have perfected an architecture so secure and build their houses of material so strong that they could not be broken into by any of their natural enemies until man came with tools of steel and dynamite
Unable to secure sufficient supply of natural food they adjusted themselves to diet of cellulose wood fibre
This they either use as spawning beds for distinctive kind of mushroom the Volvaria Eurhisa and the Xylaria Nigripes
These mushroom beds they cultivate carefully preventing the growth of other unfavorable species
In other forms of termites large numbers of flagellated pro tozoa are found in their intestinal canal
The weight of these protozoa is often one half the total weight of the entire termite
The termite eats cel lulose and the protozoon digests it
In doing so it dies and itself forms food for the host
These pro tozoa the Trychonympha Campanula are found no where else in the world only in the intestines of the termite
They build their homes of intestinal secretion mixed with small particles of sand or vegetable debris
This forms wall that is hard and per fect protection against their natural enemies
Their houses are perfectly ventilated and at the same time kept warm by some heating system probably gen erated by decaying vegetable mould
While they need moisture they are enabled to live in tropical countries where the rain falls very seldom
Do they make water
Or conserve it
Who knows
At least they have all they need
Compared with their size the height of their buildings is enormous
Suppose man was to build according to the same scale
Then his houses would have to be feet high something that so far has never been attempted by the race we are so proud of belonging to
In architecture they show the most astonishing variation especially when you consider that all of the actual building is from the inside out
Their houses have spires domes columns fagades they imitate every known geometrical shape known to mankind but they go beyond that and become so grotesque that it would seem that some mighty mind had fashioned thefh in and during an attack of delirium tremens
They not only build houses but they build tun nels
Destroyed by the light unable to defend themselves in any way they go enormous distances for food and always through tunnels of their own construction
At times enormous colonies are con nected by tunnels apparently for no other reason than desire to form social contact with each other perhaps some union political and economic
They have solved the problem of food
Every thing they touch can be eaten
They eat their dead the useless members of their colony they even eat repeatedly their own dejecta
Nothing is wasted nothing is useless
In time of surplus they place little piles of food in corners
Certain workers have nothing to do but to supply food to other groups of their political organization
They continue their group life by hatching and caring for the eggs and young of the Queen
She is an enormous creature ten or fifteen times larger than her subjects
She simply lies in the royal cell and for life of five years she lays one egg second thirty million year or one hundred and fifty mil lion in her lifetime
When she grows old she is eaten and replaced by younger Queen
The eggs are fed different foods and conse quently develop different kinds of termites
Some have thought that there are as many as fifteen dif ferent kinds carefully differentiated and shaped ac cording to the work that they are called upon to perform
Some are workers others inside police men and still others soldiers
few are specially fed to become future queens others to be the hus bands of queens
want you to remember that these are all raised from the same kind of eggs and they are produced according to the need of the colony
If soldiers are needed then they are pro duced till the need is supplied
Do you see anything wonderful about that
Compare it with man the socalled intelligent crea ture
What can he do
man and woman can produce child
They can not even determine that childs sex
It will be some kind of child but can they make musician an artist mathematician out of it
Can they determine its shape before it is born
The termite does all that and more too
It has successfully solved all the problems of life
The community it lives in is dark sad and gloomy one but it is highly efficient
The individ ual is in every instance sacrificed for the group
It is Russia magnified and idealized million times
But they have survived through the ages
For ten million years the Ant has been at war with the termite but the Termite still survives
It lives on not as an individual but as colony
Who di rects it
Souderman Goes to Work single acre in Africa there may be twenty colonies
Each house seems to be separate and yet there seems to be an uniform rhythm of life
They do things in the same way and at the same time
Some naturalists have thought that this can be called instinct
That all the deeds of this wonder ful little thing are without intelligence
Fabre said there is no reason in the wasp no real mind in the bee no intelligence in the ant and yet the termite is far above these lesser creatures
Fstudied this matter
Was there an intelligence
If so was it an individual or group matter
Perhaps there was an electrical phenomona something resemb ling the contact of our neurones and dendrones
spent years searching for an answer
For while thought that the Queen headed the group but learned that she was subject to the same immov able laws that governed all the rest
She was simply highly specialized glorified worker and when her usefulness was over she was killed and eaten just like all the rest of the colony
There seemed to be some occult power some SCIENCE WONDER STORIES SCIENCE APPARATUS FOR THE DETECTION OF SUBSTRATUM COMMUNICATION AMONG TERMITES Ths theory that termites might communicate with each other by means of substratum vibrations usually not audible to the humaa ear led to the construction of the apparatus described below
more extensive paper on the subject of termite communication will appear later but it is thought that an account of the method of detection of substratum vibrations of termites might have more general interest at this time
The inside of telephone transmitter consisting of the carbon eup and screw to which the diaphragm is attached was connected to four dry cells
The pri mary of ten to one ratio audio transformer was sopertermite intellect directing the affairs each hottse
hunted for it and for years could not find it
tried to apply every known physical and metaphysical law to the problem and all that at tained was failure
Twenty years passed
During that time had done nothing but live and think and study termites
tried to become one of them
felt that if could only put myself in the place say of the Queen that could understand the mental reactions of the unit the house the colony better
got no where but to the depths of des pair
felt piti fully dumb ig norant helpless
was on the out side separated from the Great Truth not so much by the colony wall but by sheer lack of intellect
These little termites helpless blind small were liv ing mental life so complicated that great scientist could not begin to un derstand it
Then sud denly wondered about the noise
For there is noise that comes from the colo nies
Some think that it is music
Others call it cracklings tic tacs whistles cries of alarm If the ear is placed on the wall of termite colony these sounds are plain ly heard
had known of them for years
Now it came to me like stroke of lightning that perhaps they could be interpreted
Up to the present time confess that much of my work had been simply the observation of the average insect student
had carefully duplicated the methods followed by other men and had de vised few methods of my own but there was noth ing very original
With my new desire ta interpret the sounds that came from the termitary came new Vox LXIX NO
head mono FlQ
Showing crM section of miarophena and itn base
connected to the microphone and batteries while the secondary of the transformer was connected to the input terminals of an audio amplifier such as is used in radio work
Aa RCA UniRectron AP ampli fier was used in this case and an ordinary pair of head phones was connected to the output terminals of the amplifier
The diaphragm was removed from the telephone transmitter and piece of the wood in habited by the termites was threaded on the diaphragm screw The termites crawling upon the wood jarred tb This article from the June issue of Science is evidence of the remarkable coincidences of the thoughts of widely separated people
Both Dr Keller and the author of this article began working on this problem at about the same time
It illustrates also that this work of Dr Keller is already showing its prophetic insight as it is engaging the attention of serious scientific workers
Other men had tried to saw openings into these houses to even blast them open with dyna mite as reward they had only the partial satis faction of seeing the inside of the termitary in state of hopeless confusion it gave them no real idea of the life that was being lived there under the usual circumstances
What should be done was to study the life without disturbing it observe it through the unbroken wall
That was my ambi tion
Thanks the new im provements the science of the amplification of sound was able to assemble rather satis factory appara tus
First there was bell shaped stetho scope little similar to the in strument used by physicians to examine the heart
It had rim of soft rub ber which had little holes in it
When this was pressed to the wall of colony house it remain ed there by suc tion
Inside was diaphragm
had the sound augmented radio tubes and finally given to me by loud speaker
Now all had to do was to sit in my ob servation tent and listen to the sounds that were being formed in the termitary
Natural the first instrument was not satisfac tory
The little fellows promptly ate it
They are the most remarkable eaters that have ever seen
They eat everything
In Australia they ate beds carpets foods of all kinds and even soap
It was thought that if the foods were put in tin cans they would be protected but they worked at the tin literally corroded it with juice they secrete and then ate the rusty metal and the food inside
They think nothing at all of eating carbon grains thus altering the current from the dry cells
This produced sound which ws Amplified to the extent that termite walking on the wood could be heard through the head phones
It was found best to mount the microphone button and attached wood on piece of sponge rubber in order that out side vibrations jarring the table or floor would not register on the apparatus
After several hours of observation some soldiers of Eeticulitermes fiavipes Kollar became disturbed and were thus stimulated fo hammer their heads upon the wood
This performance could be plainly seen at the same time that the amplified noise produced was easily heard through the head phones
This action on the part of soldiers of Reticulitermes fiavipes has never before been recorded to our knowledge and we imagine that the sound would be almost impossible to hear under natural conditions
Audible sounds made in similar manner have been detected among several genera of Kalotcr mitidae Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae before but there has been some confusion in the literature as to whether the sounds were caused by hammer ing the head or by some stridulatory apparatus
Experiments conducted by the senior author how ever seem to indicate that termites hear air vibra tions very poorly if at all while at the same time they are very sensitive to substratnm
This fact together with the definite proof that the head hammering produces distinct substratum vibra tion tends to support the idea that these insects com municate with each other through the nest material
Probably the asymmetrical mandibles of Capntermet and allied genera are modified for making sub stratum vibration by snapping the mandibles
At these substratnm sounds are generally associated with disturbance it is thought likely that they are utilized as symbols of danger
The jerking motion of termites commonly observed did not register enough vibration through the sub stratum to be detected in the apparatus and there seems to be no indication that this action is method of communication by sound although evidence points to the strong possibility that termites communicate by means of this jerking motion possibly by meant of an odor stimulation
There is tome indication reported by Dr Snyder of the Bureau of Entomology that excessive substratum vibration frequently produced will deter termites from occupying certain situations
Crossties of railroads with heavy traffic and buildings occupied by cotton machinery in motion seem to be immune to attack and the above experiments indicate the reason
Alrsd ExmttOH Robert Simpson DmxRSirr or Pmeatmett THE HUMAN TERMITES through lead of any thickness
They can finally go through glass wall
Naturally they made short work of my first acoustophone but fooled them
made study of the cement they used in building was able to make fairly good imitation and cov ered all the apparatus with that
guess they thought it was part of their colony house at least they did not try to eat it
Now followed long days of study
realized that my life was not long enough to do all the re search especially when it came to the interpretation of new language so enlisted help
The poor fellow was wonderful linguist but he just hated bugs of all kinds so made hundreds of phono graph records for him and let him study them in comfort in his house at Cape Town
It was odd
did not even tell him what they were records of just told him that it was new language and that would like to see if we could isolate it and obtain some meaning as to what it was all about
The conclusions he reached after two years were as tonishing and were very useful to me in reaching my final conclusions
Working independently of him was able to isolate certain sounds but as had no idea what actions were accompanying those sounds at once saw the need of actually seeing what those little fellows were doing
That made me undertake special study of the physics of light rays
left Africa and went to France and Frenchman and made little machine that would enable me to look right through the wall of the colony house
It had some of the principles of the XRay but was far easier handled and great deal more satisfactory
Its penetrating power was only three feet but that was better than nothing
Now could look into different parts of the colony house
could see the life lived there under normal conditions
And it was my hope that as saw that life lived and heard it lived that could obtain some harmony of purpose between action and sound
Soudermans Questions FELT that at last would be able to tell whether these termites were able to think
Some of their actions pointed to intellectual pro cesses
Of course Fabre did not think so but felt that some of my observations would have made him change his opinion
Of course instinct may become very complicated but is it not possible that the hu man intelligence is after all simply composed of millions of complicated automatic instinctive acts
We learned the language of the termite
At least we thought that we did
You remember that said that the philologist in Cape Town simply knew it was language but did not know that it was language of ants
The poor fellow went wild over it
He said that he believed it was the oldest language in the world and the parent tongue of all human speech
He isolated root words estab lished derivations and finally wrote glossary com posed of over five hundred words
That was what wanted
made few hundred more records for him promised that would finance his book when he was ready to publish it and then went back to my own work determined to learn and use this new language as soon as possible
experimented for at least two years
For example took very sharp auger and bored hole one inch wide through the wall of the house that had my acoustophone attached to
Now was able to look into that house and hear into that house and note their reaction to this opening of hole
As usual number of soldiers came out and formed solid ring around the sides of the hole
Then workers came each either dropping globule of li quid cement or small piece of sand
Within an hour the opening was closed
Were these orders given
Did some supreme mentality realize the danger and close the opening by giving orders
procured an ice machine and literally froze or tried to freeze small portion of the wall
had ther mometer in the wall but there was no result
The termites simply rushed large masses of fermenting mould to that spot and in spite of my efforts they kept the temperature to point where they could live
Was that intelligence or instinct
would bore you with detailed study of all these experiments
At last came to some very definite conclusions
Each termite had some nervous system
They were able to understand certain sounds and originate certain sounds
These sounds were used in way to resemble speech at least they served as means of communication
But there was no sociability and the conversation seemed to consist mainly of orders
Some power issued orders and the millions of occupants of one termitary said Yes Sir and at once obeyed
Then was faced with new problem
Whence came these orders
What constituted the initiating force
Here was plunge into the realm of the unknown leap into the darkness of the Great Void
For listen to me and pay attention Adam Fry to this next statement
These colonies are thousands of years old
Perhaps one house is million years old
How can we tell
They are enormous things
Earthquakes cannot destroy them or tornadoes break them to pieces
Cattle wander at will over them and on their tops enor mous trees grow for it is peculiar fact that they hold all vegetation growing on their colony houses as thing sacred and not to be eaten
Listen to me
Man since the day of Magellan has sailed and walked and flown around the world
They have gone up in the air and down into the deep seas
The North Pole has been looked at and the South Pole will soon be commonplace
Where has man not been
There is one place that the foot of man has never been one place the eye of man has never seen and that is the real inside of terminary
What is there
How deep do they extend into the ground
What we see may be only an outer shell
These are the questions asked myself
knew that they were old
Was the intelligence governing them old
The life of the human being is but trifle compared SCIENCE WONDER STORIES to the race history of the termite
felt that in all these million and hundreds of millions of years that they had attained to mental processes that we could only imagine
So far had seen only the carrying out of orders
The termites seemed to be but servants
Where was the greater mind
Was there mind
If so how old was it
Was it superior to my mind
Could we communicate
By this time knew the five hundred words
had isolated sentences in fact was beginning to talk their language
For example they had certain sounds to indicate that hole was broken in the wall and that it must be re paired
reproduced that series of sound that ter mite sentence on phonograph and then trans mitted it by vibration through the wall
watched the result through my visual apparatus
At once the soldiers came to guard the opening instantly the workers came with their liquid cement
Of course there was no hole to repair and there was resulting confusion
waited day and repeated the experiment
Once again there was confusion
On the third day there was no reaction
Attaching my acoustophone carefully bored hole in this same colony house
At once there was an order given but it was not the same as gave
Some new sounds had been introduced
The soldiers and workers obeyed at once and closed the hole
Here was novelty
Someone had learned that their orders were being duplicated and consequently their orders from the inside were changed and the workers instructed to pay no attention to the old form
went to another termitary and gave the original order
There was no response
Then gave the new order and for two days it was obeyed but on the third day it provoked no reaction
Do you see anything odd in that
It seemed to me that the supreme intelligence in the first termitary had communicated the news of the complication to the supreme intelligence in the second colony house
went one mile away and the result was the same hundred miles and there was no difference
CHAPTER III The Great Discovery ttOi worked game of chess with this thing that ruled the colony house
would live with the receivers of the acoustophone in my ears and by specially ingenious invention learned to talk to the termitary with such changed voice that it was an exact duplication of the tone used by the insects
And gradually it dawned upon me that there were two languages being used
One for the issuing of orders and the other dare say it
for the communication of the Supreme Intelli gences of the various colony houses
When that idea dawned upon me went rushing down to Cape Town
was growing old and there was no time to spend in isolated working
To my surprise Johanson in Cape Town had ar rived at the same conclusion had namely that there were two languages
He had been so stupi fied at the idea that he felt it almost impossible to put it into words but when blurted out the same thought to him his tongue was loosened and for lover an hour he spoke as though touched with the Divine Fire
We talked over the matter for day and here is our conclusion
The termitary has two languages
One is very simple and is used only for the giving of orders
The other is vastly more complicated only imper fectly understood by the soldiers and workers and apparently used as means of communication be tween the Intelligences of different colony houses
Johanson hated insects
He just naturally could not stand the thought of an ant crawling over him but he came with me to my termite colonies and will give him the credit for staying there two weeks
Then he left me
The work we accomplished dur ing those two weeks placed me on the threshold of the Great Discovery
ceased to worry about the lesser language
In fact found that the vibratory scale of the two languages was so different that could tune in the greater language and tune out the lesser one
On the day started to do this was nearly years old
And the thought came to me irresistible tre mendous aweinspiring that the words was hearing were being uttered or produced by an in tellect that was perhaps million perhaps ten mil lion years old
And was trying to understand it
nothing mere speck of timeunity of years was trying to understand and analyze and study something that was perhaps alive when my an cestors were crawling reptiles or something less
But had the Urge
could not eat
was unable to sleep
Nothing would satisfy me but the knowl edge of the Ultimate
And when was heard them talk and under stood them
Do you see what that meant to me
For two years there had been no experimental work had attempted nothing new had simply sat there in chair or rested on my cot with the receivers in my ears
learned the language
And then the Great Idea came to me
This termitary with the millions of termites all carefully differentiated in shape and ability to per form the various forms of work required for the successful functioning of the Colony was not com posed of millions of individuals but was simply one large animal
The Colony House was the skele ton changed according to the growth of the animal and its needs
Think this over well
One large animal
Does it mean anything
Think of an animal million years old ten million years old
Imagine the wis dom that it would have accumulated
And these little things we called termites they were just so many cells in the body of this animal
With the conception of this fact realized that was faced with the wisest most remarkable life that had ever appeared or would ever appear on this globe
All the forms of life that had been coincident with it THE HUMAN TERMITES had disappeared unable to withstand the changing conditions of earthly existence but the Giant Ter mite had survived
The Palaeozoic types were all gone
The pterodactyl mammoth cave bear saber toothed tiger had all failed to adjust themselves
But this animal was thinking of had slowly con quered continents and was threatening Europe and Northern America
And was studying it Alone unarmed incompetent had the temerity to place my intellect above that of million years
Other lives were gone but they lived on
They had met with cunning patience changes in mois ture temperature sources of food
In every in stance their intelligence had been sufficient to pro vide security against threatening danger
In all the studies made by over fifty careful observers only one termitary was found lifeless
Thus there was no death rate
They lived on and believed that their ambition was to finally rule the world
That gave me food for thought
knew that the area they lived on was slowly expanding
Now and then new cities fresh agricultural areas were overrun
Was there method back of this
Could they plot prepare and premeditate an attack
Each one was hopeless in its stationary position
It could not move but it could form new members
Across the field it would send cement tunnel and through this blind tunnel the workers would go per haps for hundred feet and there new Colony House would be erected
saw that happen
For two years saw such house grow and during all those two years it was ruled by the Intelligence from the first house and then Oh
You must be lieve me for this is one of the greatest of proofs the tunnels were broken the two houses became separate and in the second house was second In telligence and it was not new form but had the wisdom and apparent endless age of the first
Was it part
determined that what had seen was simply budding cleavage peculiar form of birth of new individual
And thus by slowly establishing new individuals all with the same mentality they hoped to conquer the world
An Amazing Conversation REMAINED silent
As said for over two years did nothing but listen
And finally could stand it no longer
Their plans were so heart less so coldly diabolical maddening in their clever ness and deadly in their ability to wait for thou sand million years if only at the end of that time they were able to rule the world and drive out all other forms of life it was all so horrible that just had to do something
You will remember that had never tried to talk to them
But now determined to do so
formulated phrase in their language and vibrated that phrase through the walls of hundred Colony Houses in the immediate neighborhood of my lab oratory
said This is large world
There is room for all
Why try to destroy all other life And then went back to my favorite termitary replaced the acoustophone and started to listen
And what heard was this
wrote it on piece of paper and put it in my wallet
It was fortunate that did so
Here is the paper and here is the message
For long while we have been studying you
Be cause of this we have tolerated you
Now you must leave
can tolerate no interference with our plans
For years had been unmolested by the ter mites
Here was the explanation
To complete their knowledge they had to study man
In order to do this they had to have man near them
They could not catch man and make him source of observation
For all these years had obliged them by remaining in one place
thought that was studying them whereas the truth was they had been studying me
For once in my life was ab solutely at loss as to my future conduct
Rest less went to bed
The next morning after bad night of dreams woke to find my laboratory wreck
Everything was gone eaten cut to little pieces
My records apparatus food supplies were gone
My clothing was eaten but had been spared though the cot slept on even the mattress was complete wreck
They had told me to leave and this was the final warning
had the clothes on my back some memos in my wallet and that was all
Of course the very valuable phonograph records were safe in Cape Town
At least thought so
hurried there but was too late
Poor Johanson had been attacked the same night only he had been killed literally eaten alive by millions of warrior termites while his records in fact his entire house was wreck
was horrified and at the same time knew that my life might be the next to go
Here was time for deceit
arranged to leave Cape Town on certain steamer
told dozens of peo ple that was going to do so
even went out to colony of Termitaries and shouted the news and then at the last minute left in an airplane
That ship sank the day after it sailed from Cape Town and all on board were lost
Divers examined the hull and found that it was literally eaten to pieces by termites
Looks as though they tried to get me
do not think they can in New York City
It is too cold but they are working on the problem of living in cold climates
They have to solve that and then they will creep over the world
So there is my story and there is the danger
Johanson could cor roborate it but he is dead
Our records are de stroyed
Only my intellect survives and am now an old man
Well Adam Fry cease writing and tell me if you believe it The young man smiled Certainly believe it
Why not
At one time studied medicine
The anatomy of the human body is proof that you are right
For days have SCIENCE WONDER STORIES been listening to you describe those colony houses and all the time have been thinking making use of my imagination trying to compare your termite organization with the human body
You have made the comparison one worth while
You told me when we first met that what you wanted was man with imagination young man that could think outside the beaten track
Well will reward your search and will make statement
The only difference between the Termitary and Man is one of age and intelligence Souderman laughed almost hysterically as he grabbed his student and kissed him on either cheek My dear boy my real son
You see it
You see it
You saw the analogy all by yourself
wanted to have you do that
For nights have been pray ing that you do this
did not want to tell you for that would spoil it all
Only by arriving at this con clusion separately could you show me that you were worthy to share my secret
Now can die happy for know that you will go on and on
With the foundation have laid you will be able to build superstructure that will astonish and perhaps save the human race from future terrible destruction
believe you are right
believe with you that there is an universal pattern of life of which the combined life of single termite colony is the oldest and most remarkable form
It must have been the oldest form and all the other life on the earth since its development must have been foolish efforts to imitate that type of life
With what success or failure you can judge
We think man has been the great achievement of the ages
To the ability of the Great Termite we have added locomotion
What else
Does the Giant Termite know anything man is ignorant of
My boy when think of his intelligence and our ignorance have to laugh at the colossal asses we are making of our selves
For years studied the termite
was thrilled at my discoveries and at the fact that my apparatus was untouched and then suddenly found out that was the one they were studying and when they were through with me they destroyed my work they killed poor Johanson and in their efforts to get me they wrecked large steamer
They are simply waiting
Time with them means nothing
And when they have learned the little things they need they will come North and when they do all other life will vanish
They are selfsufficient and need no allies
For millions of years the real ant has been fighting thejn but what is the result
Not in single instance has the black ant been suc cessful
Soudermans Warning TALKED about single pattern of life
We are form of termite colony only we are infinitely lower than the Giant Termite of the Tropics
We live sixty seventy years and then we are dead
wonder if the real Termite knows what group death is
We prate of our nervous system our red and our white corpuscles our muscle bone and diges tive cells but are they under the control of our wills
Not at all and yet in the case of the Giant Termite every function is absolutely governed by the Central Intelligence
It is true that when our outer wall our skin is broken it is repaired by our workers but what poor process that repair is in comparison with the repair of the wall of the ter mite colony house
Everything we do is childlike puerile infantile compared to their profound efficiency
If we knew what they knew we would be able to prolong life indefinitely become efficient in any line of endeavor
Our problems of life nutrition housing disease the temperature of the body all these things would be simplified
We call ourselves human beings in reality we are simply collection of number of interrelated but at the same time independent cells living within colony wall called the skin and so far we know absolutely nothing concerning the real governing of these cells by means of the higher in telligence mind or whatcanyoucallit of the cen tral nervous system
The Central Intelligence of the Giant Termite issues direct orders to all the individual cells which form his body
Consider them as cells or as in dividual living creatures little termites whatever you please but no matter how you call them they are absolutely under the control of the Central Monarch the IT of that colony
Can we do that
If our liver cells are sick can we make thousands of new ones
If there are too many white cor puscles the policemen of our blood can we order that one third of them be destroyed and eaten for the public good
Can we form new human beings
You say yes but will they automatically be pos sessed with the accumulated power and wisdom of the past hundred million years
How about the idiot the epileptic the defective we procreate
There is none of that in the Giant Termite
Man knows lot but when he comes in conflict with these stationary animals who have serenely wandered down from the past aeons he has to sur render
He cannot live with them or in fact near them
They strike in the dark but when they finish there is no place for the man form of term ite
Some day they will come
We will be blindly going to the movies amusing ourselves talking through the air listening to the radio dashing over the roads in our automobiles aimlessly like so many cockroaches or flying in the air like blunder ing beetles
We will die as race before we are able to appreciate what has killed us
Perhaps for some centuries few of the human beings will survive shivering around the poles
see it all and you will too because you have imagination but who else will see it
Can the race be warned They cannot replied Adam Fry
They will almost kill themselves laughing at us if we try to warn them
Tornadoes they understand death from war and tidal waves destruction from famine and pestilence they have at least read of but that whole nations should perish through the silent THE HUMAN TERMITES working of creature that they would only see as small helpless defenseless blind white ant they will not understand
They are too grandiose too sure of their position in the world they live in too confident that they are selected by God to rule the world
They are even confident of God But the race must be saved insisted Souder man
We are men
It is incomprehensible that our brothers should be so stupid but we must save them in spite of their asinine lack of imagination
say that we must save them
In reality you must because will not be here much longer
You have the secret
In the little time have to live will teach you all know and then as you grow older you must teach some one else
Perhaps when the real test comes when there is the final struggle the one man who is our descendant might save man kind That is some measure of responsibility know but it has to be assumed feel said Adam Fry slowly as though he was not sure of his statement that the first thing we should do is to preserve your knowledge of the language of the Giant Termite
do not mean the command language spoken to the warriors and lab orers but rather the language used by the Central Intelligences when they were talking with each other
You surely know it by heart at least you have enough of it so you could make phonographic records or perhaps better still teach it to few philologists so they could make written language out of it
Then there is another idea which can be developed in the course of the next few years
feel that your work was cut short and that it is incomplete without an effort made to actually find and see one of these things whatever you might call it which is the head the actual intellectual force behind the animal you call the Giant Termite
feel that something might be learned if one was actually captured
If its knowledge was so superior to ours perhaps some compromise might be reached
How about it Your first idea is good one replied the old scientist
Work once done need not be repeated
Many years of my life was spent in the endeavor to learn this peculiar language
If some one repeated that work it would be simply time wasted
It will be an easy matter for me to make phonograph records and could also teach it to you
Perhaps we can enlist the aid of real linguist who will work out grammar and vocabulary
We will think about it
In regard to your second sugges tion it opens interesting possibilities
Of course you realize that left Africa the way did because felt that some one should know the secret and was convinced that the Giant Termites were going to do all they could to stop me
They killed Johanson
Of course some would call that coincidence but feel that it was the tremendous effort of gigantic intellect to preserve secrecy
have tried to imagine what such thing looked like but have failed
Perhaps one could be located and captured but it looks impos sible to me
Of course we could drill into termi tary and blast it with dynamite and thus we might get to the bottom of the animal but it might be that this would only result in its death
Perhaps they are psychic and when we found everything we would have to confess that we have actually found nothing
It might be like the thing we call soul
We think that there is soul but in the autopsy room on the dissecting table where is there trace of it
have thought of gray mass round with convolutions shaped like the brain of man but what would it be like without its body
Could it live on
Naturally we could not capture an entire colony and transplant it
No someone who knows more than do will have to undertake the problem of determining what the actual Central Intelligence of the Giant Termite really is
know the danger of it the shrewd vast intelligence of it the ability it has to bide its time and adjust itself to changes of its externals
But cannot even guess what it looks like or how it can ever be conquered CHAPTER IV The First Invasion TT TELL there is nothing like trying said Adam Fry bluntly
Nothing can be ac complished without the primary effort
Suppose we get the language put into an imperish able form and then some years from now may go to Africa myself
want you to make map of that region for me
want to go there and lo cate that special Giant Termite you talked to the one that threatened you if you did not leave them alone the one who said he had been studying you
Perhaps could catch him All that spring the two men worked and on into the summer
Phonographic records were made maps were drawn detailed blue prints showing the various scientific instruments used by Souder man In his years of African study
As soon as Adam Fry was able to sustain his share of the con versation the two men talked in the termite lan guage first perfecting themselves in the language of the workers which Souderman called the Com mand language and then advancing to the speech of the Giant Intellect used only in intercommunica tion between the Egos of the different colonies
The young man worked harder than he had ever done before in his entire adult life
Gradually the two manuscripts neared completion and finally they were finished
The one was sent by express to the Congressional Library at Washington while the other was in drawer waiting to be carried to the New York City Library
The men had decided to take this valuable document in person to the Li brarian and explain to him the importance of it
They had decided to do this the first of August
It was an interesting sight to see the two men on that morning
The one old stoopedshouldered and whitehaired and yet with the gleam of youth in his eye the younger man keenly alert physically capable of any exertion brilliantly equipped in SCIENCE WONDER STORIES every way to play the part in life that fell to his lot
They wore red neckties this morning and were freshly shaved
Souderman even insisted on carrying cane
He cried that man was as old as he feels
They ate hearty breakfast of soft boiled eggs bacon toast and coffee
Then they prepared to start out
But when they opened the drawer the book was gone
It was manuscript book the pages and soft leather cover held together by steel rings
These steel rings were in the drawer
The two men looked at each other
At last Souderman said with deep sigh
The summer has been hot Then he pulled the drawer wide open and pointed to long tube the size of straw and about the same color that stretched from one corner of the drawer over to the middle where the book had been
Termites he whispered
Adam Fry looked at him as though thousand questions darted from his eyes
But all his tongue could say was coincidence The old man smilingly shook his head We might fool ourselves by thinking so my lad but with the Giant Termites nothing happens by accident by coincidence
This is simply the first attack of the enemy
It might not have hap pened in the winter but they have taken advantage of the long and very hot summer
How did they lo cate us
You cannot think
Where is your imag ination
am sure that they did not look me up in the telephone directory
But now is not the time for morbid introspection and idle speculation
Now is the time for action
Here is the thread of life the channel through which the attack was made
Suppose we try to follow it downward
They probably came up through the leg of the table
recall now that it has not been moved since we came here Suppose we tilt it over on its side
See that hole in the bottom of that leg
Now where did it connect with the floor
Just as thought
There is the hole
Now somewhere in the ground under this building is the main body of the Giant Termite that was assigned to this work
Can you imagine the cunning the intellect the enormous mentality of such being
Immobile not capable of changing his home he yet devised methods to be carried to New York by ship locate himself in the city find us here satisfy himself that am the man he has been seeking
Then he established sta tions for observation in our rooms
No doubt every word we said all of our plans perhaps for all know even our thoughts were understood appreciated and stored in the store house of memory
We think that we were shrewd in placing one copy in the Congressional Library
Perhaps even now Giant Termite is waiting there to destroy it when it comes
Well boy our part nership is over from now on our only safety lies in separation and rapidly moving from place to place
Fortunately we duplicated the phonograph records
We will each take half of them
am going to secure skilled linguist and go to some cold country like Labrador and teach him the termite language
You do what you think best but be care ful of yourself because one night will ruin your hopes Do you still think that they want to kill us
They had thousand chances do not know
They never tried to hurt me so long as they thought was not going to fight them
Just as soon as they considered me an enemy they came close to destroying my life Adam Fry sighed
do not want to leave New York yet
have an idea that want to work out
Then will be satisfied to go to Africa and see what can do there
tried to imagine all you told me but these later developments show me something that before seemed only visionary and fantastic
feel that you are more than right
All these Giant Termites need is some sure defense against the cold and they will overrun the world
They may not kill mankind but it is possible that we may be reduced to abject slavery life of raising cellulose and mixing cement for our Masters
Are you going to try and find this individual Termite that is living somewhere under this building No replied Souderman vigorously shaking his head the best thing to do is to pack our things and get out
Suppose we spend three hours tracing this slender hollow tube of cement to the basement
By the time we return we might find the entire surface of every phonograph record smeared with glass like cement and utterly ruined
We had better leave
said out loud that was going to Labrador and you said out loud that you would stay in the city
We had both better change our plans and think them instead of saying them
Perhaps they are able to read our thoughts
Perhaps not
But you have ample funds and all know you do
You go ahead
The safety of the human race lies in your hands Finding the Man ITHOUT the loss of any more time the two men packed the most valuable of their posses sions and left the small apartment that had been their home for so many interesting months of com panionship
It was not till they were several miles away from the apartment house that they ventured to speak
They went into small cafeteria that was humming with the noise of thousand busy cus tomers
Buying some rolls and coffee they sat down
Then Souderman took out paper and pencil and wrote an address on the paper
will be here if you want me he whispered and handed the paper over to Adam Fry
The young man looked at it long time memorizing it then burned it and placed the ashes in his coffee
Fine he commented
There could be no better place
will let you know from time to time how THE HUMAN TERMITES things are going
Goodhye my dear Master and take care of yourself And so they parted
The young man took his heavy bundle of records and went to cold storage plant that made spe cialty of taking care of furs and other perishable valuables
He left the phonographic records of the Giant Termite language there and walked out on the street
To all appearances he looked just like any one of ten thousand men he passed every few minutes
There was this difference
He knew what danger menaced them and he cared they neither knew nor cared
He was on his way to save them
He went to cheap hotel and registered for hours
Once in his room he simply sat and thought
He had the beginnings of an idea and he wanted to find some one who would have suffi cient mentality to take that thought and push it over into actuality
Even as Souderman had hunt ed for man with imagination so was Fry search ing for supermind an intellect that would be able to think in channels hitherto unknown to mankind
The young man felt keenly that the saving of the human race was the responsibility of Souderman and himself but he wanted to enlarge the partner ship
He felt keenly the need of brain better trained than his in what
Perhaps in sociology religion world politics
He hardly knew what kind of brain the manner of man that he really want ed but he did know that he could not rest till he had found the man and told him the story of the Giant Termites and the additional thought that he had which so far he could not form
So far he had to be content with the simple knowledge that the germ of the thought existed
Fry reviewed the men that he had known the great men in the world who were really doing work of vast importance
There were scientists econo mists business men politicians world visionaries lawyers physicians psychologists and leaders of Teligious thought
Wherever he located in his mind man of sufficient intellect he saw the man so en grossed with work that it seemed impossible to re quire of him the faking of one additional burden
Rich men poor men industrious men giant intel lects doing the work of dozen average men the labor of million morons
Where among such men could he find man who would willingly listen to perfect stranger
He saw that none of them would willingly listen to him but perhaps he could force one to for at least few hours till interest made it impossible for the listener to break the thread of the narrative
With this new viewpoint he again went over the list of the men he knew or had heard of and finally selected bank president
Here was peculiar choice
Bailey Bankerville was the descendant of the famous Bankerville who had largely financed the American Revolution
No one knew just how long the family had been finan ciers
Perhaps they originally came from the Vank de Ville family and everyone knows that they were the financial power behind William the Conqueror when he conducted the campaign that conquered isolated England
Bailey or BB
th as he was known to his intimate friends had become the head of the family on the early death of his father
He had handled the affairs of the enormous corpora tion with the greatest ease by finding capable men to do the work for him
Consequently he had found sufficient time to play and he had done so
His play would be considered by other men as work
For example he spent large sum and year of his life making careful study of the mono liths of Easter Island
When he finished this he was easily the worlds best authority on these enormous remains of people long since dead and forgotten
His book on the subject printed in limited edition of twenty volumes is one of the most prized works sought by anthropologists
With noth ing but stones to work with he formed theory of the life and habits of these people that no one has ever been able to controvert
This work which he laughingly called play was but one of number of similar adventures in which he sought to wrest from Mother Earth her secrets
He had been so busy doing this and at the same time augmenting the family fortune that he had no time to play in fields feminine
So far he knew woman simply as the female of the Genus Homo
He was fairly well familiar with her attributes as an entity but never willingly sought the company of any woman except his mother and sisters
This was the man that Adam Fry picked out to finish the thinking of his great thought
Fry knew the man had imagination boundless perseverance and an education that equipped him to at least fol low the bare outline of any scientific discussion
The problem of the man being solved the next ques tion was how to meet him
That became far more serious than appeared at first thought
Making Him Listen AILEY BANKERVILLE was artistic and therefore temperamental
To great extent he was man of moods quick to react to little peculiar stimulations
When Fry sent in his card and asked for an interview the banker was annoyed
He had eaten salt mackerel that morning and it was repeat ing in very gastronomical way
He saw the name FRY and he asked his private secretary
Is he small or large When the man answered that the visitor was trifle small he at once reacted with the phrase small fry poor fish if see him once will never be able to get rid of him
He will be re peater like that damned mackerel
Tell him am busy
Tell him am out
Tell him refuse to see him
Tell him anything you like but show him the door Adam Fry came back the next day and the next
And never again at least not to the bankers office
The following Saturday night the banker had very uncomfortable dream in which there seem ed to be an inability to move
Waking he found that this was an actuality for he was securely tied to the bed and also gagged to prevent his call SCIENCE WONDER STORIES ing for help
lit the dim light he saw man at the foot of the bed and now that this man saw he was awake he started to talk
am Adam Fry
wanted to see you in fact had to see you
called at the office three times and you would not have anything to do with me so was forced to visit you at your home
am not robber or murderer my motive is neither commer cial nor religious
feel that if you will listen to me talk for an hour you will listen to me to the end
hope that can take the gag off and unbind you
Will you agree not to call for help The banker had saving sense of humor
For week he had been making fun of this man without ever seeing him
Now the man had him
Sure will listen to you he said as the gag was untied
Let me free and we will go to the library and spend the rest of the night
think you are bothersome interloper but anyone that is clever enough to pull this stunt is worthy of consid eration
suppose you are some new kind of bond salesman one of those gogetter devils
Let me turn on the light and locate my bathrobe and slip pers and for goodness sake put that gun away
It might go off and break something like looking glass
Hard luck you know to have looking glass break In few minutes they were in the library com fortably seated in overstuffed leather chairs
Bank erville offered drink which Fry refused saying You will think that am drunk anyway before we are through Then Adam Fry started to talk to the banker
He first told all about the Giant Termites as studied by Souderman
He was still telling about them when the butler entered the room to open the shades and let in the sunlight
Bankerville jumped up with start
Lets shave and dress
We can talk while we are shaving
Then we will have breakfast
will send word to the bank that will not be there today
never had so much mental sport since Tige was pup
do not know where you have been staying but know where you are going to stay from now on
You are going to be my guest
do not know how much you have to tell me but you are going to tell it all before you quit
Send for those records
They must be kept safe and am going to send the best linguists can hire to examine them and learn that language
You either are insane or you are up against the largest problem that ever hit mankind since the flood
You highjacked me into this and by the Sacred Cow of Benares am going to stay in as one of the leading actors till the play is finished That is what wanted you to do answered Adam Fry
He was greatly pleased
In fact he felt that now he could begin fighting in earnest
At the same time he realized that even though the rich man was thrilled with the story of the Giant Termites there was still large question and very important one to be answered
Would the mans brain leap over the gap that had stopped the mental processes of Adam Fry
There was secret there somewhere
Fry felt it could see dimly the outline of great truth but the final devel opment was still an impossibility
It needed some thing better than Fry brain
Would Banker ville intelligence suffice
The two men shaved and prepared for breakfast
At that time rather startling surprise awaited Adam Fry
Bankerville had sister and that young lady Susanne Bankerville was very much in attend ance on the two men
In any household news spreads like wildfire and the bankers sister greatly pleased at the idea of anyone actually hogtying her brother and forcing him to listen to wildgoose yam had violated all feminine rules and was at the breakfast table charmingly clad and apparently anxious to make toast for the two men
Up to this time Bankerville and his sister had been sufficient unto themselves
Clad in masculine attire she had accompanied him on all of his queer expeditions and the fact that she had obtained an excellent scientific education made her very valu able aid to Bankerville in his anthropological re searches
She did not look very masculine this par ticular morning and that was entirely her own pre meditated fault
She had lived with her brother for thirty years he being five years older than she
During that time she had never known of any man getting the best of her brother in any kind of conflict
Now the whole household was buzzing with suppressed curiosity and it was no wonder that she made herself very charmingly feminine and waited with considerable desire the appearance of the dragon killer
Adam Fry was at loss to know how to con sider her after the introduction
Could he talk freely or must he be guarded in all he said
Bank erville lost no time placing him at his ease as he followed up the introduction with long tirade con cerning the real worth of his sister and at the same time what tremendous nuisance she always was when they visited the faroff places of the earth
This young lady he began refuses to let me get out of town without her
Ever since she start ed to walk she has been tagger
She ran away from school to go to the Easter Islands with me
We never did find her till we were three hundred miles from shore
She would not have shown up then were it not for the fact that she became sea sick
Well that is the way it has been
When am in New York she behaves mighty decent but just as soon as get the wanderlust she insists on getting out her knickers and though try mighty hard cannot shake her from my trail
This is the first time in five years that she has had breakfast with me
Because she smells rat
She thinks that am into something and she refuses to be left out
do not know how she came to find out that invited you to breakfast so we could discuss the new classification of shellfish but women are peculiar that way
She thinks that you are Boy Scout or something and she wanted to meet you
She looks real cute now but you ought to see her THE HUMAN TERMITES in her war togs
Yoti can say anything you want to in her presence she is absolutely to be trusted
And will say this her brain is better than mine for she has feminine intuition That was the end of his speech
Susanne Bank erville smiled And now Mr Fry tell me about the shellfish Giant Termites my dear sister corrected the brother
Do you know anything about Termites Miss Bankerville asked Fry
certainly do not but do not mind me
You start right in where you left off last night or was it this morning or have you just begun
The in formation have is so confusing
Brother says he asked you to have breakfast with him and others say that your conversation started during the night Well let our guest eat and then we will all go to the library
have sent for those records and when they come will play them on the Orthophon ic
know sister will like to hear them
She is wild about all those foreign jabbers The rest of the meal was very quiet and almost formal
The young lady soon showed that she was the perfect hostess and Adam Fry was at once placed in position where he had to acknowledge that he was having very pleasant time
CHAPTER Fry Delivers Lecture OON after they were again seated in the library but at this and for that matter at all future sessions Susanne Bankerville was an interest ed member of the audience
There is no doubt continued Adam Fry that the millions of little blind termites enclosed in colony house simply compose so many parts of one animal which Souderman called for convenience the Giant Termite
feel that for correct understand ing of our problem we must consider the colony as an outer shell or skeleton
The various workers warriors even the Queen and her husband are all dispensable and replaceable but irrespective of the deathrate of the individual termite the Giant Ter mite lives on as he is always absolutely able to re place any of his dead individuals
feel and that is what told Souderman to his great delight that all life follows the same primitive pattern
First there was one cell and then num ber of cells united for offensive and defensive rea sons
Then the cells specialized
The analogy be tween the Giant Termite and all other life is inter esting but perhaps especially so in man
The human body is composed of laTge number of individual cells
They serve many different purposes and like the individual termite can only do one kind of work
The termite works industriously at its task which was predetermined before it was matured
It can do nothing else
The corpuscle in the blood stream is similar the red cell carries oxygen under no circumstance can it do anything else
The white cell is scavenger it cleans up the debris but never can it carry oxygen
The nerve cells carry messages but the muscle cells contract
All these millions of cells are contained in skin just as the millions of termites are contained inside the stone wall of the colony house
The great ad vantage that the Giant Termite has over the human termite is the fact that it can send out its cells from the body proper and be sure that they will return
When our cells leave the confines of the skin they are lost
That is what happens when there is hemorrhage
The individual cells go but they never return
They are absolutely lost
When we com pare the control the Central Intelligence of the Giant Termite has over its individual cells to the control that the Central Intelligence of man has over his cells we are forced to acknowledge our pitiful inadequacy
What takes place within us does so without our knowledge control or approval
How different in the Giant Termite
Occasionally our cells revolt die without being replaced new cells grow in disproportionate manner and we die of cancer
At the best we live but few years and then we die while the Giant Termite lives on
doubt if it knows death
The Giant Termite is what it is today because for millions of years it has been made to fight enemies of life of atmosphere of bitter surround ings
It had to endure hunger privation danger and yet survive
In the short time man has lived what has he learned
Practically nothing Just one minute interrupted Susanne Banker ville
Do understand that each individual ter mite has separate intelligence They must have
compare them to cells and yet the microscope shows that they are really formed of many cells
They have the ability to understand speech because they obey orders
They have definite speech with words and yet they have no initiative
AH they can do is obey
Com munism social discipline is carried to such point that every one of them has to be finally sacrificed to the good of the community
They work for the Central Intelligence but have no part in any happi ness or benefits
The entire social order is predi cated on selfsacrifice of the individual in order that the mass the entire animal might live Another question
Do you think that the cells within our bodies have similar individuality peculiar type of mentality
Do they know any thing
Can the blood cell the little bone cell the muscle fiber think reason do anything but obey nervous impulse Adam Fry looked at the girl curiously as he re plied Honestly do not know
Certainly there is not the beautiful control of our cells that the Cen tral Intelligence of the Giant Termite exercises over his individual termite cells
We cannot force our cells to perform certain acts
Of course we can in limited way as in walking but the efforts we make to manage the affairs of our body are pitifully infan tile
We cannot even keep alive or well SCIENCE WONDER STORIES Yet every part of the work done by the Giant Termite is duplicated in our bodies Practically
But poorly
It is as though we were just learning as though after million years we were just out of our infancy barely beginning to understand life
We are learning to talk but we lisp stutter utter thoughts in baby talk
Nothing like that with the Giant Termite How much do they know anyway growled Bankerville
How can tell
Souderman worked with them for years and he was completely nonplussed at the end
He even accused them jokingly of finding our apartment in New York by making use of tele phone directory
Perhaps they have all the wisdom of the entire preceding ages
Perhaps they know hundred times more than we do
They certainly have perfected bodily structure that is infinitely more remarkable than ours
They have by Jove what an idea
They have put legs on their cor puscles taught them to walk instead of swim and then took away their blood liquid
Their cells liter ally run around in dry arteries juiceless capillaries and yet are able to perform all the necessary work
The human female has an ovary bilateral
If all the conditions are right she may be able to repro duce herself but in doing so she is subject to thousand adverse conditions
The Giant Termite reproduces at will any of its cells and when it is ready divides its Central Intelligence whatever that may be and forms new individual And suppose your idea is that all life is like the Termite only not so highly organized Something like that
It seems that perhaps the dog the fish bird human being are all simples forms of the termite colony Suzanne Understands OR while all three were silent
An oppressive silence seemed to hover like mist over them
The sun which had been shining through the li brary windows was now covered by the fog that arose from the smoketortured city
For all his ac customed poise Bailey Bankerville started in to tremble
It seemed that he was tortured by the effort to think
The sweat started to break out on his forehead
am trying to think of something and it eludes me
Something about us and the Giant Termite and cannot get it out
Can you help me Adam Fry cannot
have had the same feeling for week
That is why came to you
There is some thing there that ought to see but for the life of me am unable to
feel it
It just comes so far up to the threshold of consciousness and then it sinks back without crossing
have been unable to sleep because of it
thought you with your vaster experience in the mysteries of the world could fathom it And then Susanne Bankerville jumped up and began to dance around the room like twirling der vish
And as she twirled she sang have it
have it
HAVE ITU And she started to laugh hysterically
Then she threw herself into her brothers lap and sobbed
The rich man looked over her shoulder towards Adam Fry
Dont mind her he said softly
She gets this way sometimes
suppose that you would call it psychic or something
Usually its very well worth while what she says when she is able to say Finally the sister sat up and wiped her face as she said
Silly and all that but the idea was too big for me
But it is what you men were hunting for
just know it is
You said Mr Fry that all life had certain pattern and the pattern and the oldest and most perfect pattern was the Giant Termite
You said he was formed of millions of little white ants and then you said that each little termite was formed of little cells In making your comparison with man you said he was on par with the Giant Termite but you gave him too much credit
He is simply on the level physiologically and psychically with the little termite
He has no initiative no spontaneous ability to control his actions
can not explain it but believe that all the people in the United States are simply little termites the cities are large colony houses
The cities are connected with roads rails even air routes but over all the millions of inhabitants is Central Intelligence that governs and directs
No He can not be God not as understand God
There is Central Intelligence for each nation Mexico France Turkey Germany Russia
And the peo ple of each nation are just like those poor little blind termites that sacrifice everything for the good of the nation
do not believe that the Central In telligence of the humans National Animals is as clever as intelligent as the Central Power of the Giant Termite
They are not so old and they do so many silly things
Russia is trying to put into force some of the habits of the termitary
They call it communism
Now that is my idea The two men looked at each other in silence
Finally the rich man said Not very pleasant thought Adam Fry to feel that one and all of us human beings are just run ning around doing what we are told to do by Cen tral Intelligence that is not God and that has not even the brains of Giant Termite Not pleasing but it sounds as though if was true
feel that this is the thought have been looking for
The world has to be saved from those white ants
Meantime the human race poorly gov erned badly directed expends their strength fight ing among each other while all the time the termite terror becomes more real The brother turned almost fiercely on his sister What do you mean Susanne by Central In telligence governing the United States and an other one governing Mexico
Do you mean the political power the combined thought and deter mined purpose of the people the will of the mass THE HUMAN TERMITES to rule combined psychic impulse jointly held by the entire nation Nothing of the kind was the determined reply if life has one pattern and the Giant Termite is the pattern then everything you say is nonsense
Mr Fry says that Souderman proved positively that the little termites were hopeless and helpless and all they had to do and all they could do was to obey the orders of the supreme intellect think he called it the Central Intelligence
They do just what he or it says
The Queen lays so many eggs and when he says Enough they kill and eat her
The eggs are developed into so many workers so many out side warriors so many internal policemen so many nymphs according to his orders
If food has to be secured the colony defended new termitary formed then he orders and they obey
If they are too many he commands that certain percent be eaten
Not in single instance as far as can learn from your talk and from what Ive heard of Mae terlincks book is there the least suggestion that at any time they are capable of independent thinking or action
In the scale of life in this uniform pat tern of existence we men and women correspond to the little helpless blind insignificant termites and if this is true then we have nothing whatever to do with our government
We may think that we have but that is just delusional ideation if you will allow my phraseology
No doubt our President is selected rather like the Queen termite is
When the Central Intelligence is through with him he is thrown out of tlje White House and killed as Wil son was Well
Lets go on with the argument
This is growing interesting
We are all little termites and have nothing to do with our lives or actions
All is controlled by Higher Central Intelligence
Is it God No Less than God Of course
Far less than even the Central In telligence of one little colony in South Africa Where is it will answer that said Fry suddenly interrupt ing
One of the things that Souderman failed to do was to actually see the ruler of termitary
Mark you he talked to one
He was convinced that there was one
He was sure that they were able to talk to each other and that there was per fect accord and communicated harmony between them but he never saw one
He says that no man has ever seen the inside of colony house
That is he means entirely
He did not know how deep they extended into the earth
But down there some where in the termitary was this Central Control ling force
have the blue prints of all of his in struments the study he made of the two languages one the command tongue and the other used for the intercommunication of the rulers is preserved for us on phonographic records
Souderman actually talked to the THING and IT talked back
Now if all life has the same pattern and we could ac tually see this THING that rules colony house
then we might be able to at least imagine that something like that ruled the separate Human Termite nations
These things that rule us may be powerful but fancy that to great extent they are stupid Laying Plans ANKERVILLE threw his sister off his lap and started to walk the floor
Suddenly he ex claimed Perhaps we are all wrong
Surely if the three of us are just little helpless termites of humanity we are doing lot of criticism of our Central In telligence
We are doing lot of independent thinking
Perhaps sister is mistaken That is logical statement answered Fry
But you must remember that the animal of which we are part is still in very experimental stage
do not think that conversation dreams and crit icisms such as we have been indulging in would be possible between three little white ants
They have had all such independent initiative crushed out of them by millions of years of communistic life
Their motto is One for All The all for one disappeared from their lives many centuries ago
feel that our seeming independence is simply proof that the animal that we are part of is in very early stage of its intellectual development and we all know that man was nearly the last animal to appear on the earth
We are pleased to say he is the greatest and most highly developed while in reality he is probably the weak est of all the earth patterns just as the Giant Termite is the strongest
Nevertheless since we have the thought that we are supreme we can at least play the game bravely
We may be governed by the Supreme Force think Schopenhauer called it the WILL Claude Ber nard spoke of Morphological Plan another phil osopher called it the CauselessCause of all Causes do not care what you call it
personally am in favor of fighting the battle out to the end
We may get the worst of it
If we could look into the future we might recognize even now the hopelessness of the struggle but as it is why not fight
Three of us all loyal to each other and consecrated to the betterment of our fellows
Then there is Souder man brave old man fleeing to cold country so his knowledge can be preserved
He can be counted as number four That sounds good to me said Bankerville It has been long time since have had vacation
Time to start something
The more danger there is in it the better pleased will be
Any sugges tions as to our line of attack think that we ought to try and solve the ques tion of just what the Central Intelligence of the Giant Termite really is
That will help us in our effort to understand and influence the same motive or governing force in the human National Termite SCIENCE WONDER STORliss if our idea that there is such force is correct
believe that an expedition to Africa at the present time is sure to be dangerous one but that is the only way to start it
have the exact location of the Giant Termite that ordered Souderman to leave the country
That is the one to go after
We will duplicate Soudermans machinery for listening and conveying sound and then after we have learned the higher language we will talk to this THING and if we escape alive we may have secured suffi cient knowledge to communicate with the Central Intellectual Power of this nation and see if we cannot drive some common sense into his thick skull
Miss Bankerville you have been of the greatest help to us but you must not go to Africa
You have no idea of the danger
If man like Sou derman is thoroughly alarmed over the situation it is certainly no place for woman like you to be The girl but no she was every bit woman now and fighting one walked over to Adam Fry and took hold of his shoulder as she said What do you think am Mr Fry
Here have been fretting my life away in the city for over year and now at the first chance have had for real sport you say it is too dangerous
You and brother need me
Did you know that can speak seven foreign languages
Do you realize that have flair for languages real appreciation of sound
have to go with you dont brother
He has never gone alone have you brother
You would be cruel to force me to stay
Now its all settled and am sure you feel better knowing that have de cided to give up New York society for your com pany
Lets start on those records
am thrilled with the idea of actually listening to termite talk especially Giant Termite that is millions of years old Bailey Bankerville threw up his hands in well simulated hopelessness
You see how it is Fry
This girl has bossed me ever since she was walkytalky baby
guess the only way to get rid of her is to take her with us
am going to send for your clothes and you will be our guest till we start
think will send long message to the Librarian of the Congres sional Library warning him to carefully protect that manuscript
It would be good idea for him to make few hundred photostatic copies and dis tribute them throughout the world
am going to send for some manufacturers of scientific apparatus and start them to work on those acoustophones that Souderman used in listening to the conversation of the termites
think that it will be good idea to hire few expert philologists and one or two en tomologists
We need firstclass staff of scientific workers at least to start with
feel that the closer we keep our secret the better for us because do not think it will help any to broadcast our in tentions
Hells bells
If those white ants can read telephone directory they may be able to read the newspapers CHAPTER VI Going to Work ITH man of Bankervilles training to think was to act
He converted several rooms of his house into workshop and in stalled over dozen scientists all of whom were famous in their particular line
The phonograph records were reproduced and several sets sent out to strategic points in the northern part of the world
Work was started on the scientific apparatus that was necessary
An improvement was at once made in the Xray sight machine and instead of few feet of vision obtained by Souderman over ten feet were now possible
Fry Bankerville and Susanne worked at fever heat
It seemed as though time were valuable jewel not to be wasted in any way
Not until the third evening was there any relaxation and then for some unaccountable fem inine whim Miss Bankerville dragged the un suspecting Adam Fry to the roof garden of the Bankerville mansion
It was beautiful evening lovely location and supremely attractive woman
Adam was really not to blame if he tried in any way to duplicate the conduct of his namesake of the Garden
However such procedure was far from his thought
For the time being he could think talk and dream of nothing but the termite
The woman realized this
At the same time she was woman
Those termites seem almost devoid of emotion Mr Fry They certainly are
Of course they may have thoughts that are unknown to us but mainly their life is cold cruel materialistic one Then there is no love as we know it doubt it
The entomologist Escherich was fortunate enough to open royal apartment and observe it for few minutes before the alarm was given
He drew picture of that apartment and its inhabitants which have been seeing in my sleep it haunts me like nightmare
Souderman had copy of it and we used to study it
He felt that it was very true to life
He saw the Queen large inert white creature feminine God cre ated for one purpose only the laying of an egg every second
In large ring around the outer sides of the room solid ring of enormous warriors are constantly on guard
ceaseless line of work ers deposit drops of food into the mouth of their motionless sovereign
Other workers seize each egg as it drops wash it and carry it away to the nurseries
Around the Queen small policemen guard her from any possible attack
For five years she lays an egg second
Then her usefulness over she is deprived of food dies of starvation and is like all other dead termites ejiten Susanne shuddered am glad that am not Termite Queen
Has she husband Yes poor little insignificant thing
He is only small fraction of her size and spends most of THE HUMAN TERMITES his time hiding underneath her to avoid being eaten by the workers
It is thought that he fertilizes her eggs after she voids them Susanne shuddered again
This gesture drew her closer to Adam Fry
am glad she said that you are not termite male And Adam Fry replied that he was glad that they were just human beings able to look up to the stars and smell the flowers and know what the love of life really was
After month of hard work the scientific ex pedition was ready to start to Africa
special steamer had been chartered and loaded with every thing necessary to promote success
There were two airplanes and the same number of competent pilots
Laboratory workers entomologists lingu ists and one expert in poisons that might be ap plicable to the termites if danger presented
Prob ably few expeditions had been so thoroughly equipped in such short time
It was still sum mer time and the plans provided for start on the first of August
Strange Attack was the last of July
The boat was all ready
It was the last night the three conspirators were to spend in the Bankerville mansion
The talk that night was not about termites but of the social changes that would take place in the world if the controlling Force of the nation could be discovered and influenced for the good of the common people
About ten several terrific explosions were heard and the entire house was rocked on its foun dations
Earthquake asked Fry
Earthquake nothing
That was some kind of dynamite or TNT
Hear those shouts
Sounds like mob
That is queer thing
First time knew anyone had it in for me
We will in vestigate this later on
The thing to do now is to get out and do it quick
Lets slip out through the garden and back to the car and beat it to the boat
smell smoke perhaps they are trying to set fire to the house
Here Fry take gun and you Susanne take this pair of automatics
Thank good ness you know how to use them
Now lets beat it And in the darkness that just preceded the flare that told of the burning of the house they rushed to the automobile and down to the ship
Once on board the ship Bankerville started to tele phone to the various members of the expedition to join him at once
All night he stayed at the phone giving thousand orders and not once did he make any re mark about the attack on the house
Before daylight all were on board and orders were given to start down the bay
It was not till the ship was several hundred miles out from New York that he seemed to notice the other members of the party
They unable to help him in his complete absorption of the various problems arising from the sudden leaving had spent part of the night listening to the news that was coming over the Radio Sun of New York
Newspapers were still in existence but many millions of urbanites re ceived all the news of the day over radio newspapers and part of the equipment of the ship consisted of radio and television news service
The three Bailey Bankerville his sister Susanne and Adam Fry gathered in Bankervilles cabin before breakfast
What happened last night Sister he asked
An unorganized mob for some reason at tacked our house
Some members of that mob had dynamite
They blew up part of the house set fire to all of it plundered what they could and badly handled all the servants
Three of our people were killed in cluding James the butler
The police were at once notified but by some mistake went to the wrong part of the city
By the time they were on the job the damage was done
The fire department came out but the mob cut the hose lines
There was terrific riot
It was the belief of the reporters that the three of us were buried under the ruins of the house
Apparently our quick getqway fooled them
There the police are at loss to understand the reason back of the attack
Several of the rioters were arrested but could give no explana tion for their conduct
They simply said that for some reason they had to do it they saw crowd running and they ran along
The editorial comment is rather pe culiar
There is good deal of talk about the rich op pressing the poor and the possibility of Commun ism spreading throughout the United States
It ap pears that there is suspicion that the fire department and the police were in sympathy with the rioters at least their handling of the entire matter was very in efficient
The Police Commissioner is going to make special investigation
He states that for some reason there were hundreds of traffic violations at that time of the night at least ten times more than normal and his men were so busy trying to get things fixed on the streets that he could not handle the riot as well as he might have on other evenings and of course that in itself is peculiar
The President has come out in guarded statement saying that there has been great deal of criticism of the government by certain classes of the financial aristocrats and that whenever that happens the lower classes feel privileged to do as they please
It all looks like mess to me Bailey What do you think about it Adam Fry asked the banker
Well of course do not know much about the way the common people feel concerning you and your wealth but the suddenness with which this happened the dazed condition of the prisoners their inability to understand what it is all about the coincident traffic difficulty the fact that the police went to the wrong part of the city the cutting of the fire hose and even the state ment of the President all seem to me to point to one thing And what is it that you men think demanded Susanne
The two men looked at each other
guess we think the same dont we finally asked the banker
Have to
What else can we think SCIENCE WONDER STORIES Well go ahead and say it said the sister rather peevishly
Its simply this finally said Fry
The Cen tral Intelligence of this United States the Ego or what ever you call it that we talked about when we compared the life of nation to the life of Giant Termite well that Central Power wherever and whatever it is grew tired of our independence and original thinking and criticism of his stupidity and ineffi ciency and He ordered lot of workers to go and destroy us Losing Themselves fTHAT is just what think said Bankerville emphatically
Of course would not have thought that some months ago but it really is beauti ful demonstration of our hypothesis
No doubt many of those people from the President down thought they were acting on their own initiative whereas in reality they were just obeying orders like the workers or sol diers in Termitary
For some reason we were able to think trifle faster than the Central Power
Of course if he had known we were in that automobile or here on the boat all night he could easily have gone ahead with the killing
He is capable of good many things but he is not omnipotent by any means
The three of us are perhaps insulated in some way against his power
We irritate him but he cannot get rid of us
Perhaps he feels about us like human being feels about beginning cancer
Now the question arises as to what his next move is going to be
Will he think that we are dead under the burning building
Or will he be able to locate us on the ship
If he can per haps he can command the crew to mutiny and kill us here
He can easily find out where we are heading for as the ships clearance was for Cape Town
What do you think we had better do Susanne believe we had better get lost What do you mean Can you depend on the crew to be loyal believe so
Most of them have been with me before Then send wireless out to the effect that the ship under orders left New York last night but that the three leaders of the expedition are missing and it is believed that they were killed in the riot
few hours later send an SOS
that the ship is sinking
Then send another that the situation is hopeless and the crew has taken to boats
Then put the crew to work painting new name on the ship and changing her generally
Slip into some little South American port and bribe the port authorities to give you false clear ance papers and just go out on the seven seas as tramp steamer
No use going to Cape Town for there are all kinds of reasons that they will be waiting for us there not only the Giant Termites but the represen tatives of the Central Human Termite Power
No doubt the English and American Powers are in sym pathy Well they would control Australia Certainly but we would not go to any port and even if we did we would not be recognized in our new disguise
Maeterlinck says that at Cape York Aus tralia large groups of termitaries can be seen from ship board
We have had an exciting twentyfour hours but we must not lose sight of the fact that the main reason for this expedition is to find just what the real ruler of the Giant Termite really is like
We decided that we had to know that in order to come to any under standing of the same force in the national termite
Lets go on and do what we started out to do Your entire plan sounds like common sense Su sanne said her brother
Do you know Fry that this little woman is right just about all the time wonder why that is asked Fry
That is because am woman replied Susanne
You know we are right because we use intuition in stead of reason in arriving at our decisions During the next two weeks Susannes progamme was carried out to the letter
Gold bribed Central Amer ican Port official
Dirty linens unshaved faces com pletely changed the appearances of the officers and crew
All entered into the spirit of the game and it was hard to tell Bankerville from the most villainous seaman
Susanne as the cabin boy made thorough ly hardboiled lad
Several times they were stopped by American and English war ships but in every case their general looks and false papers were sufficient to fool the inspecting officers
Whenever this happened Fry and Bankerville would look at each other silently while Susanne in her cabin would execute real horn pipe
Hot diggity dog
she would exclaim
Guess the little girl knew her onions
They are certainly after us but so far we have them fooled Bankerville Gives Orders HUS they finally came to Australia
It took an other week of careful sailing to locate Cape York
Several miles out they were forced to anchor but the termite colonies could easily be seen through glasses
There were hundreds of them rising many feet in the air in every possible shape
After their long trip the crew looked at the peculiar coast line with great deal of interest
It was dusk and Bankerville gave orders that under no circum stances should any one leave the ship for any pur pose
Then he called meeting of Susanne Adam Fry and the Captain
As they gathered in his cabin he almost shouted Well we are here now
The voyage is over Then he started to write on piece of paper sig nalling to the three that they should watch him and this is what he wrote
believe that our destination is known to the various powers that are determined to destroy us
The only way that we can escape from them is to think faster than they do
am sure that they can hear the vibration of the voice over great distances and that is how they came near killing us in New York City
want them to think that we are here and going to stay
In reality we are going to wait till dark and then slip out to sea
To the east of us are the New Hebrides
There are thirty islands in this group but only twenty of them are inhabited as the termites are so bad on some of the smaller THE HUMAN TERMITES ones that the inhabitants have despaired of growing anything
One of these uninhabited islands is called Whitsunday and that is where we are going
Do you understand The three silently nodded
Bankerville silently held the paper in his hand struck match and burned all he had written
Three hours later the tramp steamer raised anchor and slowly steamed eastward
Four days later it found pleasant and safe harbor on the east side of Whitsunday Island
It was
over seven weeks since they had left New York
During the voyage their destination had been changed three times
Now they hoped that in this safe harbor of an isolated uninhabited country they could start in their study of the Giant Termite and the occult power that ruled it
The harbor was so small and yet so deep and landlocked that it was decided to keep on living on the steamer and make regular visits to the termitaries which even from the ship were plainly visible some being eighteen and twenty feet high
Some apparatus was sent ashore but as most of it was portable it was thought ad visable to carry it back and forth each day
That night Bankerville for the first time had staff meeting of all the scientists
These gentle men had not been at all idle on the trip but had spent long hours of study some at the extensive li brary on the termite others learning the language from the phonograph records while the poison ex pert dabbled in his laboratory concocting new and deadly liquids and gases to use if necessary
As usual Bankerville ruled this meeting
He was
natural ruler and while he always consulted Fry and his sister still when there was public meet ing of any kind he allowed no doubt as to who was in command of the expedition
Gentlemen he said
suppose you all are aware of the real purpose of this expedition
We are here to make complete and thorough study of the Giant Termite
Some of us have peculiar ideas of just where this study will lead us but irrespec tive of those views would urge all of you to be true to your scientific education
If your observa tions fail to show that Souderman was right in some of his ideas want you to say so
For example you may arrive at the conclusion that what Souderman thought was language is simply coincidental conglomeration of natural sounds proceeding from the termitary and not in anyway connected with mental processes of any kind or form of life
You must remember that Souderman led an isolated antisocial life for many years
He thought of nothing saw nothing heard nothing except it was in some way
connected with the termite
Under these circumstances it is entirely possible that he may have had hallucinations
He made double records but the Giant Termite talking back to him may have been nothing but the other side of his dual personality
In other words he may have had the split nature the true Schizophrenia of the paranoid praecox
In all of your scientific study of the termite remember these things
If one of you make discovery do not accept it as the truth but see if three or four of your fellows are able to arrive at the same conclusion indepen dently of each other
want you also to always bear in mind that we feel there is possibility that we are here dealing with personality that is very old and very intelli gent
It may be that the things we call the brains of the Giant Termite are far more intelligent than we are
They had no trouble in killing Johanson in Africa to keep him from spreading the facts about their dual language
They traced Souderman to New York and ate his manuscripts
Be on your guard
Because they are so small always out of sight do not underestimate their power
Because you never saw thing happen do not think that it cannot happen
They are cunning
They have been known to eat picture frame and all and at the same time cement the glass to the wall to keep it from falling and waking the people in the room
With such insects the only safe way is to remain constantly alert
There is no telling what they will do next
As the old copy book said Eternal Vigi lance is the price of safety feel that we should finish this work as soon as possible but we do not want to finish it before we are through
By that mean that we do not want to be forced to leave
The least relaxation of cau tion the slightest break on our part may be the means of driving us from our work on this island
want each of you to make as much progress in his speciality as possible but at the same time want all your work to bear on one problem
Has the Giant Termite Central Force or Intelligence
If it has is this something like the mind of man simply higher form of central nervous system or is it some occult power
Whatever it is is it above or below the mentality of the human being
Can this Central Force be understood apprehended by the senses of man by sight hearing touch or is it something in new dimension that might be thought of but would not be tangible like objects in the three sensual dimensions
This is the problem that has brought Mr Fry and me to this island and we want to stay here till we have satisfactory answer to at least part of the question
Finally want you to recall that we are dodging the influence of some peculiar occult power that has threatened us since that fateful night in New York
So far think that we have been able to keep one move ahead of that power but at any time these influences may find us
am going to ask you to be very careful of your own feelings
If you become angry mad at one of your fellow men report the matter at once to either Mr Fry or my self
It may be that your desire to harm your fel lowman is desire that is put into you by this oc cult power
There may be even mutiny
Please think of this
Remember that our success has large influence on the future hopes of mankind The next day they started to work
To he continued It was an esplanade two miles long
We were facing southwest mile high and the view was magnificent
We were above the southern end of Central Park but New York City was gone Manhattan was wellkept meadow
THE CUBIC CITY ffrTWO miles wide two miles long and two miles high is eight cubic miles
Eight floors to the hundred feet or four hundred to the mile give three thousand two hundred square miles of floor space
This is as large as an ancient city forty miles long and twenty wide covered solidly with houses four stories high and no part of it is more than two miles from any other part Obvious answered but not enthusing You do not click it shrugged my guide
The phrase intrigued me and stared at him
He was neatly uniformed in dark olivedrab like hotel bellboy but few bellboys have such chin and none such eyes of flashing dark intelligence
Try it from another slant he said
We have no traffic problem What is your population asked
About eighty millions You are not overcrowded sneered
He took me seriously
Eight hundred floors he said about hundred thousand to floor
That twentyfive thousand to the square mile and forty persons to the acre
We give thousand square feet of floorspace to each
That is enough Where do you get your light He flung his hand upward
thought the pas sage flooded with sane twentyseven The room was large about twenty feet by thirty and white
It had low divan across one end and held two or three easychairs and tables but was on the whole sparsely furnished
The young man waved me to chair and sat down himself
see no windows
How do we get ventilation asked
Compressed air is released near the floor
It goes out into the pas sageway through that ornamental steel grating over the door
In sum mer its expansion cools the rooms
We keep brisk cool even tempera ture all the year round
Here is the electric heater if you want more warmth the fan if you want breeze
This is the bathroom door
Here is the light switch here is the Graph What is Graph He looked at me intently
thought it universal in the world he said at last even par don me on farms Do look like farmer Not in the least he answered but am an explorer smiled

Many things in your ultramodern civilization puzzle me
Explain as if were child Pleased by my confidential tone he answered Press this black but REV

is briskly
But daylight but now saw that the light rose from behind narrow cornice and was re flected from the white tiles of the ceiling to those of the floor
Helium tubes he said Exactly the same quality and intensity as sunshine
Here is your room He unlocked door and set my suit case inside
motioned him in after me
come from far away said and am behind the times
Make sure before you go that can understand your conveniences
What for instance is the number of my room he an swered and handed me tagged key then translated Floor four hundred south section passage fifty room HE present story is one of the most extra ordinary ones which it has been our good fortune to read in years
It is another one of those that will make history
As you read the story you are not certain whether the author is serious or whether he laughs up his sleeve at the failure of the human race in general particularly when it comes to the big problem of transportation and human conduct in large centers of population
One of the strangest if not the strangest phase of our civilization is found in our city transportation
The automobile which was supposed to save us great deal of time on ac count of its speed has been signally defeated in our large cities and even the mediumsized ones
Today the automobile as vehicle to move people speedily has signally defeated it self
Due to the very large number of auto mobiles their effectiveness has been nullified and in our big cities you can walk short dis tances much quicker than ride
The author of this story must be given credit for having developed most unusual as well as original idea which is not only origin al but highly plausible
The city which he plans does away with all traffic problems as we know them today and you are constantly asking yourself the question yes why not
Indeed we believe this story to be prophetic because sooner or later some such city as fore seen by this talented author will come about
We only hope that the author unll have some similar treats in store for us in the future

Real meals are served at any restaurant along the passageway Thank you said
will not keep you longer and handed him quarter
He looked at it long and curiously then spun it away sprang to the graph and began to dial trembling with wrath
Room he barked Cartex speaking
Send police
Attempted bribery might have tried to soothe him but he fell back into his chair unconscious
tried to go to him but had just strength enough to stagger to chair myself
Interrogated ROUSED to find two quiet strangers in the room
The one bending over Cartex remarked There was little too much gas
Well have to wait His voice was very calm
What is it all about officer asked
What did you do countered my own man gently
Gave him tip
We always tip the bellboy where live answered
The two policemen eyed each other and took long look at them
They had the same prominent chins as Cartex and eyes of dark intelligence and were dressed much as he was
They were how ever agreeably unexcited
What is tip asked one
Money for carrying my suitcase explained
The custom still survives in Central Africa commented the other
Do you live there No though have been there
live in New York Cartex man raised his eyebrows and answered This is New York Before had recovered from this thunderbolt he went on Uganda keeps the custom because the blacks there feel themselves inferior to the whites
Here there are no such social strata
Cartex mis understood
The insult was too great Where there is no intention to be insulting there is no insult
Cartex looks intelligent
He will for give me
What did do You assumed that Cartex was your social in ferior Isnt he Certainly not
Cartex is dramatic student working along to degree But even so coin or two from one who has larger income Your incomes are the same
By the way let me see your service card
We need your name age place of origin and data What is servicecard The two men looked at each other again and there was so long pause that during it Cartex woke up
He did it thoroughly and all at once like kitten
Cartex said learn from this man that was rude to you by offering you money for service rendered
did not understand
beg your pardon He did not mean to bribe you explained my man
There was another pause while Cartex visibly controlled himself and considered
At last he smiled
Then there was no offense he decided withdraw charges Excellent said my man
Come tell the Judge
The stranger has no servicecard
Where did you find him Walking along this passage with his key in one hand and suitcase in the other
He asked the way to his room Where is the suitcase snapped the other man
They searched the whole apartment but could not find it
What did you do with it my man de manded at last
Nothing answered
Cartex set it just in side the door
have not seen it since Ruffled by this they took me along hundred yards of passageway and entered an elevator in silence
How do you manage an elevatorshaft two miles high asked Cartex
We dont he said
We break the trip every few dozen stories And ease the pressure on your waterpipes by tanks every few stories also suppose con tinued
Of course agreed Cartex
The court had graphs and dictaphones enough and very few spectators but otherwise it was much like my idea of such places formed from the illu strated papers
The judge was quiet thin clean shaven courteous man in black gown more like highgrade surgeon than judge
He ordered me seated in very comfortable metal chair upon rubber mat under very powerful arclight then flashed blue lightning at me from under his white eyebrows and asked why was there
Lost In Time UNDERSTAND said that there is some informality about what the quiet gentlemen with the heavy shoes call Servicecard My young friend Cartex also preferred charge of bribery against me but courteously withdrew it on learning that had no such design THE CUBIC CITY
Explain said the judge to Cartex Cartex did SO
What is your name the judge then asked me
Griswold Lee answered
Where were you born Baton Rouge Louisiana Jan The keen thin tired face of the judge suddenly changed
His interest in me had been professional
Now it was personal and vivid
Where do you live Brooklyn said and gave him my address on Remsen Street
What is your occupation First soldier then after the war explorer and freelance imaginative writer
The world would not believe my discoveries in Thibet when pre sented them as facts so was compelled to dress them up and sell them as fiction How did you get here do not know Judge
Twenty minutes ago was sitting at my desk in Brooklyn writing an article
Suddenly found myself walking down passageway in this hotel with tagged roomkey in one hand and my suitcase in the other
looked around for the bellboy who should be with me but found no one
Then met Cartex What was the subject of the article The probable development of the ultramodern city The judge looked at me too intently for comfort
Then he asked quiet man in onepiece tan over alls who was sitting at keyboard watching plotted curve Inspector can you detect hiatus The man looked up and shook his head
He had so keen and kind face that liked him
There is no hiatus he answered
When an impossible statement is made under the Veriscope the judge explained speaking with clearcut precision only one course is open to the court to detain the subject for observation by competent alienists
Mr Lees delusion that he is in twentiethcentury hotel is clear
Mr Lee permit me to compliment your selfcontrol
You have passed through some unknown experience so drastic that it has not only deprived you of your servicecard but has obliterated from your mind all memory of itself and of your personal identity and still you retain mental poise and balance
It gives me great regret that have no choice except to commit you to psychopathic hospital for ob servation upon the charge of Inurbanity
am re quired by statute to ask if you have any requests to make before this is done It would be great pleasure to see your city Judge said and Cartex who understand is dramatic student working through college as bellboy was kind enough to overlook my involun tary rudeness and withdraw charges thus making himself my friend
If Cartex might be assigned to guide me Cartex rose to object but the judge spoke first
There is no hiatus he said Mr
Lee accurately states both his opinion and his wishes
It might be of assistance to diagnosis to act upon them
Has Doctor Gray arrived Here sir nervously answered someone from the door
Lee went on the judge Cartex and Doc tor Gray have long been friends
They will act as your escort
The suspected defect
Doctor is In urbanity
You may familiarize yourself with the details of the case from the newspapers
Verdict suspended and subject remanded to the care of Cartex and Dr Gray
Next case Dr Gray came over and spoke to me
He was dressed much like Cartex keen pleasant dapper little man middleaged with brown beard and hair and eyes
He clipped his words as if in hurry
When Cartex joined us the Doctor led us out into the passage
There is so much we need to tell each other he began that we had better go where we can talk
Where shall that be The sunparlor is not crowded at this hour sug gested Cartex
In cubic city nothing is more than two miles from anything else
The average distance is about half mile
The doctor was of methodical as well as nervous turn of mind for as we strolled along he laid down lines along which we were to talk
did not fully follow him because woman and two children in rosesilk knitted bathingsuits and slippers came out of an apartment and saun tered along the passageway in front of us
They made charming little group not out of place on any seabeach but singular indoors
Then suddenly my breath was taken away for the passage debouched on great esplanade forty feet wide and two miles long roofed floored and walled with glass
Roof and floor were translucent so that we could see other levels under and above us
At first this made me dizzy but one soon grew used to it
We had come out about halfway up the wall facing southwest so that we were mile high and the view was magnificent
We looked across North River and New Jersey exactly as one might from an airplane
had been up in an air plane over New York more than once so that recognized the terrain
But recognized nothing else
We were above the southern end of Central Park but New York City was gone
Manhattan Island was wellkept meadow grassed treed and parked
You seem to have received another shock said Dr Gray
Sit down Explain ECALLED to myself look around
The inner half of the glass floor rose trifle and was filled with steamer chairs and in these chairs basking in the spring sunshine lay quite number of people in bathing suits while others strolled along the pathway
Sunbathers said the Doctor
The glass is The Cubic City is two miles wide two miles long and two miles high
It has eight hun dred floors and is as large as the ancient city forty miles long and twenty wide
Its population is eighty million
quartz glass and lets in the actinic rays
Everyone who can get the time takes sunbath every day
All doctors prescribe it The place does not seem crowded remarked
The population of this floor is hundred thou sand
It has eight miles of glass promenade all ex posed to the suns rays every day
It could accom modate hundred thousand reclining chairs but we find two rows of twenty thousand each enough except on Sundays
The sunbathers on week days are mostly women and children Cartex told me you had thousand square feet of floor space to each citizen
Do you not waste too much of it on these sunbaths About sixteen square feet each
If it took more it would be worth it but Cartex referred to space inside the building
These galleries are extra
Our board of health finds them indispens able
Not only do they cure disease but they form the best possible way to detect it
People in bath ing suits cannot conceal much about physical con dition from keeneyed doctor
We catch and cure most things before they are well started But are not the suits little er extreme asked watching couple of sixteenyearold girls stroll by
We have some regulations shrugged the doc tor but as general thing our policy is to let all do what they like so long as they do not interfere with other people
If those girls were ugly the Art Department would drop them hint if they seemed likely to become immoral they would be regulated instantly by Child Welfare we cant have unauthorized babies if they appeared un healthy the Health Department would put them through clinic but as it is if they like to expose few more square inches of young complexion than do most nobody cares
dare say Cartex bathing suit is scantier Hush Doctor warned Cartex laying finger on his own lip or read the papers So far as can understand my case Dr Gray said You are to examine me for insanity or In urbanity whatever that is and through the cour tesy of the judge you are showing me the city and observing my reactions as the easiest way to make diagnosis
Is there nothing can do to assist you to belief that am sane Tell me just how you got here answered the doctor which already know from the judge you cannot do can come pretty near it answered
Al though of course only by inference since remem ber nothing
Doctor have you ever summoned up pictures in your mind No man discovers anything without doing so THE CUBIC CITY Dr
Gray put in Cartex is one of our fore most mindspecialists and has even made an im provement in the Veriscope itself
Although ill from overwork he has assumed the duties of an assistant interne because of the great singularity and interest attaching to your case Mr Lee Then if he can grasp my oldfashioned technical phrases he may perhaps help me
It has been my habit Doctor to picture mentally the scene was describing
When made forecast concentrated until saw it
This power has grown with prac tice until quite recently it has become independently pictorial
mean that in imagining scene do not have consciously to create the details
They fill themselves in often quite accurately
For in stance in recent dispute as to the presence of large stone in salmon pool which had never seen closed my eyes willed to see the stream from above picked out the pool mentally descended to the bank looked and found the stone there also blaSfted pine which nobody had mentioned but which both my companions recalled when reminded
The sensation was exactly that of visiting the place and the results were about the same
My ex planation to them was that read telepathically the picture in their minds
The thing is not clairvoyance because do not go into trance
However have been greatly puzzled lately by unexplained small objects in my room
In one of these scenes chose to image to myself picked violet and later found newly plucked wild violet in my fingers
laid it on my desk and turned away and when looked back it was gone
Amused by this imagined treasurescenes in the past in which helped my self to gold and jewels
brought them back with me and watched them fade after an hour or so
could see no gain in telling another observer
Autohypnosis vivid as mine would necessarily be telepathic
Whether what saw were there or not the other observer would see it too and the practi cal dangers were great
Today photographed sev eral objects just brought back sent the film to be developed then settled down to finish promised article for Jeems on the probable development of cities in the near future
was intent on the most interesting part when looked up and found my self here The suitcase which you handed me was real put in Cartex real heavy and utterly ancient
Did nothing which you brought back stay Learn Much JAMMED my hands into my pockets and pro duced the usual things notebook billfold pen knife cigarette lighter and silver and even copper change
Cartex went into ecstasies over each article and pronounced them all genuine antiques of the twentieth century
Among the pennies was gold Turkish coin apparently very ancient
Where did you get that asked Cartex
did not know that it was still there
see no reason at all for you to believe me but picked that coin in imagination out of the treasurechest of an Elizabethan buccaneer
thought it had vanished like the others We believe you perfectly Mr Lee broke in the doctor
We have no doubt at all of your sin cerity
We have seen you under the Veriscope Of course we do not for moment dream that your perfectly sincere account of yourself is correct but we are searching together with you for the facts Perhaps said it will help if you tell me how this great change in citybuilding came about
At least it will assuage my curiosity The financial life of skyscraper was about twenty years answered the doctor although the mere physical life ought to be centuries
They altered quickly
They were made larger and still larger
Invention of the helium lamp giving real daylight removed the need for windows
The drift of population to the cities became an avalanche
Problems immense and sinister such as the world had never seen before arose and were grappled with one by one and solved all but the problem of lateral urban transportation
How many street levels in Two answered Cartex for me
Wilson on Transportation says that bridged streetcrossings for pedestrians did not come into general use until and then on main streets only
Sidewalks be tween crossings were not raised until some years later Whatever the dates of separate improvements shrugged Dr Gray they came too late
The grow ing population overtook them all and clogged them
Yet inside the great buildings which continued to grow larger there was no congestion Because there was no need of lateral transportation
Everything on any one floor was within easy walk of every thing else
Men took an elevator to whatever floor they wanted then walked to their destinations
Therefore each building tended to be more com plete in itself containing everything but sleeping quarters
At last it became economical to add floor or two and give janitors shopgirls elevator boys repair men and such persons dormitories in the building
The custom grew until half the city was housed in the same buildings in which it worked but since by that time the population had more than doubled this did not ease congestion in the streets
Some help was gained by throwing bridges from building to building but these be came congested too
Bridges were thrown then from every floor of every building and so the cubic city was evolved
The rest was detail What limits the size of your cube to two miles Air pressure
We find difference in vertical height of two miles about all anyone can stand
Approximately the same limit is placed by hori zontal distance
mile and back is about as far as it is practical to walk How many cubic cities have you Fiftythree in the United States about three SCIENCE WONDER STORIES hundred in the world
New York is the second largest What is the largest
London Jerusalem
It is the nearest to the centre of land surface of the globe
When the Suez Canal became congested past enlargements we blasted channels to the Mediterranean and Red Sea made Jordan Valley saltwater inland lake and the safest harbor in the globe and internationalized Palestine
The consequent growth in population made vast cubic city necessary
Internationalized Certainly
The world is governed by League of Cities What is the population of the globe About three billion
Since we discovered how to extract synthetic foods from plants we could support trillion but we judged it best to limit our numbers and improve our quality
We can cure all diseases except some forms of cancer but we can not remove inherited stupidity Cure all diseases
What is your average life then About hundred and fifty years What is your average index of intelligence For the normal population Theta
For all in cluding the subnormals Zeta
For New York City Kappa do not understand your table of ratings We divide the mental distance between the greatest genius and the stupidest person whom we are quite sure is sane into twentyfive parts
The average man in the whole world is one third of the way up
Cartex rates Sigma Sure enough there was little badge on Cartex lapel which had mistaken at first for bellboys button then for Greek Fraternity pin
Doctor Gray rates Tau smiled Cartex bow ing or did before his illness
He may do better now
And how would you rate me Doctor asked
Above myself except for your delusion an swered Doctor Gray politely
As it is am afraid that you must be classified as subnormal Cartex gasped
Revelation fH no he said not that Doctor
On side classification perhaps abnormal perhaps but not subnormal
never saw case further from Inurbanity Still what can one do where there is obsession shrugged the doctor
Isolate it insisted Cartex
First isolate it then cure it He turned to me
Admitting for the moment Griswold Lee that your belief is right and that you have come here from two centuries ago by unknown subjective methods how does the sit uation strike you
You are here now
The fact of your arrival is so plain that the method of it is comparatively unimportant
Is it not clear what your decision must be
Is not your proper course to apply for servicecard take up the work for which you are most fitted and become useful and loyal citizen dropping into the background even in your own mind the unsolved mystery of how you came To learn and labor truly to get mine own living and to do my duty in that station of life to which it has pleased God to call me misquoted smil ing
You are quite right
Of course it is There Doctor triumphed Cartex
When an obsession can be so easily mentally isolated as that it is no longer dangerous You seem intensely interested in this stranger objected Doctor Gray
am Doctor nodded Cartex though not as you imply
He named me as his friend in open court not knowing
have had admiration all my life from other men and sometimes even affection but never honest friendship
It has grown mutual think the gentleman has two obsessions Think it in silence then shrugged Cartex or shall be your enemy for life What smiled the doctor sadly is poor offi cial to do
On the one hand must brave your displeasure or on the other must release upon Society man who really on two counts is not urbane What is this Tnurbanity asked
When people crowded together in cubic cities answered Doctor Gray We found that it was possible to commit great many offences for which there was no law
We therefore made laws against such things as hawking and spitting giggling loud laughter talking in raucous voices bad temper and thousand other like matters
These laws could not be enforced
Any good lawyer could clear his client for they are all matters of degree dependent upon manner time and place
Yet any one who did not choose to keep them could make all com fort quite impossible for hundreds round him
few such men and women comparatively few could have destroyed our rising new civilization
Therefore we lumped these things under the head of Tnurbanity People with Ists and Isms crim inals people mentally ill without being quite in sane people incurably boorish and stupid people with complexes and phobias people deformed all people in short who bother others too much and will not or cannot change are classed as Inurbane In safe simple painless way they are made in capable of bearing children and are confined for life in humane institutions outside the city
Most of the institutions are almost empty
We have no longer any criminal classes
We have no insane no idiots no crippled or deformed no one with inheritable diseases no drunkards nor drugaddicts and very few extremists of any kind Also no rebels suppose said and no re formers Plenty of both bowed the doctor
Cartex here is great rebel against dramatic conventions and every new scientific discovery means drastic THE CUBIC CITY reforms but every rebellion and reform must be courteous and urbane How then shall become urbane asked
Personal consultations should be private re marked the doctor and reaching over me he raised lever in little machine upon stand beside us which machine had mistaken for radio
Quite the most urbane thing you have done yet he went on is to give me good excuse for
shutting off the newsservice Newsservice asked
Did you not know that there were several mil lion people watching and listening to us flashed Cartex
The doctor and are made for life pro fessionally by the publicity of our association with you
We have become worldfamous
Your com ing is worldnews am made for life emotionally also beamed Dr Gray
The lady whom love must marry me or Indeed she wont said Cartex indignantly
She marries for love only
Doctor you are in urbane The doctor started to his feet so angrily that thought it best to take command
Doctor sit down suggested
Even in my poor day anger was inurbane
Cartex bellboy even student bellboy should not speak so to an eminent physician
What is the secret you two are discussing over my head and under cover of gesturing with my handkerchief turned the machinelever back on
said there were two inhibitions sneered the doctor
Nonsense returned Cartex
It is the most natural thing in the world
He has not seen an other of our women except in sunbathsuit
You shall not hurt him
No woman now living had ever received or been in position to receive so great compliment honest sincere nonsentimentaL friendship from real fighting man
Dont spoil the situation
Cartex you little devil broke in
You look like boy talk like boy act like one but are you boy What do you think dimpled Cartex facing me
Take off your coat said He did so and stood in his trousers and silk shirt
Must take off my shirt Master he asked
have sunbath suit under it Which would you rather do take it off or come here and let me put my arm about you Both decided Cartex
Cartex protested Doctor Gray too loudly for politeness Dont be dramatic Inurbane CTTHO should if am not flashed Cartex from VV the hollow of my arm
You know can do anything in reason and be forgiven Griswold Lee said the doctor visibly control ling himself Cartex is one of our best comedy actresses darling of the Metropolitan stage
She can care nothing for you
She has not known you long enough
She must be trying to attract you to her to share in your enormous publicity
But she has gone too far
She jeopardizes her position
Re strain her
She must be acting but to those who love her such action is not comedy
Cartex unless you marry me must report this man inurbane
Lee in that far land you think you came from were you married No Doctor
When came back from the war the girl was engaged to had married someone else
Since then have been girlshy Girlshy
Great grief Theres such thing as love at first sight Doc tor
dont know whether Cartex feels it yet but do You darling gasped Cartex turning around in my arms and kissing me
You lightolove snarled the doctor only he paraphrased it
Then he struck at her
There seemed only one thing to do so did it
The doctor disappeared under chair drummed with his feet little and lay still and sunbath suited women from hundred lounges jumped up and screamed
Run for it
Run gasped Cartex
Where asked
This way
My room The way seemed to be along passageway just around corner and down an elevator
Cartex employed the moments pause while waiting for the elevator and stepped into the car dressed just like any other woman who had been sunbathing except that she was barefoot
The elevator girl recognized both of us but did not know anything had hap pened
Cartex led me to door unlocked it and shut us both in
Now she said tell me that you love me had but well begun when the Graph buzzed
Cartex wiggled out of my arms and ran to it
Interurban News speaking it said
Is this Miss Cartex
Confused reports have come to us that you have been abducted by maniac Is that you Jimmy
thought knew the voice
Turn on your television
have not been abducted
am in my rooms just back from sunbathing
Mr Lee is not maniac but the wisest man ever met
He fell in love with me at first sight
He is with me now
fell in love with him Jimmy we want to get married
Help us Have you no mercy Cartex You never really loved me you know Jimmie
You love news better
Get me license and min ister and will will energize my mirror and you may have the pictures
Think of the scoop The Graph blurred for moment then came clear and said They tried to cut us off
What did you do to Doctor Gray cannot prove it Jimmy the Visional was off but the poor man was ill
He had nervecrash and SCIENCE WONDER STORIES tried to blackmail me into marriage by threatening to declare Griswold Lee inurbane then called me an insulting name then struck me
Griswold hit him on the point of the chin and he was still insensible when we left Energize your mirror bar your door look out for gas and we will do what we can Married
ARTEX came back into my arms but this time she did it slowly gradually superbly
mil lion people are watching us she said rqid thou sands yet unborn will listen to what we say Are you as important as all that asked
No but you are
We live so safely in these modern cities that nothing as exciting as this has happened in decade anywhere
The world and know that you have come back from two centuries ago whether the city fathers believe it or not She pressed button ran finger down list dialed the Graph moment and quiet voice filled the room
Latest developments in the Griswold case
The two most instantaneous lovers in the world take refuge in Miss Cartex apartments
Miss Cartex bar gains for marriage license and with her usual modesty and good sense turns on the Visional
Surgeons say Doctor Gray will recover
Griswold Lee the only professional soldier now in the world does not understand the publicity accorded him
See our illustrated section You see the whole world is our chaperone re marked Cartex and leaned out of my arms to turn off the Graph
There came whir in the wall and panel fell open
She took out pneumatic con tainer opened it and displayed marriage license
The Graph whirred again
The Reverend Dr Worden of St James con sents to perform your marriage ceremony
Hurry before Dr Gray interferes All ready Jimmie answered Cartex
Go There came sound of distant organ music
It ceased and the mirror at the side of the room was filled with the image of robed clergyman who mar ried us his deep voice coming out of the Graph in stead of from his moving lips
Neither of us wore ring so Cartex fetched one from her bedroom
The ceremony over the clergyman disappeared and the Graph whirred
Doctor Gray has recovered and sworn out warrant against Griswold Lee for attempted mur der
Accept congratulations on your maariage
Keep your door barred cut off your ventilation and have your husband instantly dictate to us twenty minute account of Brooklyn and New York in nineteenthirty distinguishing carefully between what he has heard or read and what he knows of his own knowledge to be correct
If he gives detail enough we can verify from antiquarian records prove his claims and save you
Otherwise you will probably both be convicted of inurbanity and at tempted murder Jimmy thats brains cheered Cartex
Two breaths ago did not see any way out except IS spend honeymoon besieged here and end in death
Now you have saved us
Dictate Griswold dont know how to use the Graph Then will relay it
Begin The doorbell buzzed
New York said in my day was immune to noises
Upon the street we could often hear each other speak but in the subways we could not hear ourselves think
We grew so used to this few noticed it There came heavy knocking on the door
Car tex bolted it barred it jammed the overturned kitchen table slantwise under the lock and made notch in the floor to hold its lower end by ripping up tiles
In Castle Garden still contained fishes went on
The Metropolitan Museum in the last twenty years had sprouted more wings than cherub
We had learned how to fly
The interfero meter had taught us to tell the size of stars both on and off the stage
The word Camouflage had not yet come of age
The first tunnel under North River had just been finished the first bridge just begun
Drinking was in state of arrested development
Bootleggers had no souls but only spirits
Women had dropped their superstitions and ceased to dress for the Unseen
Entering uninvited anywhere was impolite and was spoken of as Crashing
Some body in the passage is trying to crash our metal door now with beam
Cartex since the illman nered persons outside are so afraid of gas would not bottle of bath ammonia poured on the rug over our ventilator together with some strips of silk and cotton burned in dish beneath it send them away Try it called Cartex and the Graph together
She ran into her little kitchenette to get the dish and screamed
dashed in after her only to plunge into the arms of small wiry policeman
smashed him back against another
The third his arms round Cartex was Doctor Gray
If the dumbwaiter had been larger really do not know what would have happened suppose they sent up little men because big ones would have stuck in it
Even as it was the fight was desperate
settled Dr Gray in the first second
He could not guard himself because his hands were full of Car tex
Then Cartex kept out of the way but when ever was hard pressed she ran in and hit one of the policemen on the head with chairleg from be hind
When they were both unconscious we tied them up and sent all three down the shaft in the dumb waiter one at time then jammed the waiter crossways cut the wires and stuffed blankets on top of it
By this time some one had blowtorch against our front door cutting through the metal
We set some more rags of cloth on fire and they ran but returned
started description of my own Brooklyn room
As looked around at Cartex luxurious nest it was easy to recall and describe my own bachelor discom forts
For several reasons kept Cartex in my THE CUBIC CITY arms
The Graph before me blurred then cleared again as the door broke in
tightened my arms around my wife and went on visualizing my own room
Then slowly found myself sitting at my desk in Brooklyn with my landlady clinging to me
It would make another story as long as this to tell how made the dear lady all the necessary ex planations going into details scrupulously
So she decided that she had better marry me
We have gone out to live in the country
She is as happy as the day is long except for one small inurbanity quite unnecessary one for have now fallen out of touch with the gentlemen in Thibet under whose auspices once studied
They do not approve of matrimony
Yet even now she will not permit me to write story unless she is allowed to act as my amanuensis

THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS HEN half the population of the planet Venus hurled itself across the void of space at our own world believing they were going to find new home here was one of the first pris oners they took
As matter of fact fell into their hands before one of them had set foot on Earth when their first bulb was still feet above it
It was cloud bank that proved my undoing
We of the Airguard had had our warning but were uncertain as to what to expect
The observatories of the Rockies Alps Andes and Himalayas had noted the mysterious objects burst ing out of the cloud envelope of Venus on orbits obviously calculated to bring them within the Earths gravitational influence
There could be no question but that some humanlike intelligence was back of the mystery
The observa tories flashed their warnings to the Central Astronomical Board which in turn reported to the Supernational Commission of the Caucasian League in Geneva
But the board went astray in its interpretation of the phenomena
Its theory was that the several thousand hurtling bulbs or spheres photo graphed by the observatories were projectiles con taining explosives or some other agency of destruc tion
Actually they housed from to men of Venus apiece fleeing their planet
They were trying to escape annihilation by volcanic forces that had gotten out of control after several centuries of increasingly ambitious use
About half the population of Venus lacked the courage to face the terrors of interplanetary space in desperate gamble for continued existence
Presumably they per ished in the Doomsday which followed and which was visible to our observatories as terrific disturbances and upheavals in the Venusian cloud en velope
Of the other half who exchanged their few remaining weeks of existence on Venus for the desperate chance of hitting pin point in space and finding it habitable after hitting it rela tively few reached the Earth
Had majority done so question whether we could have withstood them so suc cessfully with their terrible weapons
We would have overwhelmed them by sheer numbers in any event of course but men would have died by the hundreds of millions and the rest of us would have returned to the dark ages if we had not been able to overcome them before they deranged that delicate balance of production com merce finance and social structure that we call civilization
From what learned as prisoner our astronomers actually discovered only fifteen or twenty percent of the total number of bulbs launched
Altogether more than of them were hurled toward the Earth carrying about Venusians the total population of their planet being only slightly over
Only of these bulbs with crews aggregating ac tually reached Earth
Thousands of them were shattered by collisions with meteoric bodies
Thousands more were deflected from their course by unforeseen gravitational influences exerted on them and they hurtled on into space past the Earth
Still other thousands were estimated by the invaders themselves to have missed the target through errors in calculation and the im perfection of hurriedly constructed space guns But to begin at the beginning was patrolling the air lanes above Northern Mexico about hun dred miles south of the Texas line with Tubby Baines handling the radio and telescopes while Eggy Morris sat at the guns of out RandalL This was then the newest type of plane in the Air Guard ship of remarkable balance and steadiness for those days with an easily sustainable speed of miles an hour and cruising radius of miles
As far as the eye could reach and the scopes too for that matter the air was filled with patrol ships each circling the terri tory of its beat and waiting for we knew not exactly what
The bulbs were due to arrive at any time now
From one end of the continent to the other and through out Europe the Super national Leagues Red Cross Division had been mobilizing relief organizations
City populations had been FRANS PHILLIPS fJERE is the versatile author of Arrmg geddon AD and The Air Lords of Han with brand new thrilling story
There are those authors whose chief claim to our attention is their imagination and those who in addition are inventors of no mean de gree
The present author is combination of both and in addition he knows how to create action stories that are difficult to match any where
Mr Phillips has knack of inventing new instruments that are as new to literature as they are to science and there is no denying that his scientific creations are plausible and will be duplicated when the various arts have caught up with his scientific prognostic cations
It is always most interesting to us to specu late on what would happen if some alien intel ligence from another world granting that it exists would invade this planet
Many authors have tried their hand at such theme but few are as forceful and versatile in pic turing such conflict as is the present author
In addition to this he shows convincingly the importance of terrestrial conditions as they will be experienced by alien invaders
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES ordered to scatter temporarily into the open
It would not do to have one of these bulbs hit closely massed millions if they were explosive
Our orders in the Air Guard were indefinite
We were to patrol watch report and stand by for fur ther orders
We were to spot any hits of the inter planetary projectiles so that relief might be rushed to points needed with the least delay
We were all at pretty high tension
Far above us to the South was big cloud bank and it was in the middle of the afternoon that Tubby sang out to me the general order he had just picked up
All Randalls were to rise out of posi tion and head South hundred miles at whatever level was necessary to carry us above the cloud blanket
Observations it seems indicated that most of the oncoming bulbs were falling toward the Tropics
nosed upward in long easy slant that took us into the cloud bank
Once in it we could not see forty feet ahead but kept the Randall rising at full throttle for knew there would be no other plane within miles at this level
CANT tell just how it all happened it took place so rapidly but was conscious that our plane was entangled in vast mass of billow ing canvaslike material
It closed around us in overwhelming folds as we buried ourselves in it and brought up with sickening lurch
Tubbys face bore an expression of ludicrous surprise as he spreadeagled over my shoulder sailed over the rail and disappeared scratching des perately for handhold as he slid down trough in the billowing fabric
That was the last ever saw of him
have no recollection at all of what happened to Eggy
never saw him again
For moment clung to the rail as the Randall slowly turned over
Then lost my hold and slid with increasing momentum down one of the folds of that vast enveloping fabric human insect lost in chaos of drifting canvas feet above the Earth
My hand touched rope
held desperately to it and found it with my other hand
short distance below me in the fog heard crash evidently the Randall colliding with something bulky and metal lic
Then silence
Gradually the sea of canvas straightened out
knew then that was clinging to the edge of vast parachute
But my whole mind was centered on selfpreservation
had no time to wonder
went down the rope hand under hand until below me in the mist loomed section of great metal dome
With my feet planted on this more substan tial support paused to regain my breath and gather myself together
It did not yet occur to me that had found one of the interplanetary bulbs
Like everyone else had it set in my mind that these would turn out to be explosive projectiles
Moreover was complete ly dazed with the suddenness of it all
Mistily the metal dome curved downward in one direction
In the other saw railing few feet away
threw myself toward it and climbed over with sigh of relief
The whole structure was swaying sluggishly and was sinking was sure
But it had not fallen below the cloud as yet
Then hatch nearby flipped open
Three men climbed hastily out
They were clad in what looked like divers suits covering them from shoulder to foot and over their heads were large goggled helmets
My surprise evidently was equalled by their own for they paused to survey me amazedly through their big goggles
Then one of them signalled the others and all three of them leaped upon me like wildcats
Taken utterly by surprise went down under their rush
was hustled down through the hatch which clanged over my head and literally rushed down corridor into compartment that looked like combination of control room and en gineroom on one of our own big dirigibles
The ship for now knew was aboard some sort of strange aircraft was crowded
My captors had to fight their way down the corridor with me
Some of the crew through whom they pushed were clothed in divers suits and goggled helmets like themselves
Others wore sleeveless belted tunics that reached the knees and they looked to me as though they had emerged from flour barrels
Their skins were dead white as white as Grecian statues
But their eyes were yellow and their close cropped hair tawny orange
In the center of the control room was big in strument table at which marblewhite man sat surrounded by illuminated screens upon which ap peared shifting pictures
Occasionally he would reach over and twist lever or flip switch
My captors stood respectfully waiting for his attention
Finally he looked up and stared at me with piercing yellow eyes that looked out from finely chiselled face that might indeed have been marble from its total lack of color
But he had little time for me then
He waved his hand and turned back to his instruments
My captors hustled me off to little compartment where was locked in
Later came slight jar
The ship had come to rest on the ground
There was clanging of doors and rushing of feet babel of voices and harsh com mands and the sound of heavy machinery being hauled around
My captors reappeared and literally dragged me down spiral companionway to the lower decks of the ship and thence into the bright light of day
Squat Guns Cough LOOKED around in amazement
had emerged from great metal sphere about feet in diameter
Around me was the greatest activity
Some fifteen hundred helmeted figures had spread out over the plain
Split up into disciplined groups THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS they were busily setting up what appeared to be numerous searchlights and squat broadmouthed antiaircraft guns of complicated design
In the sky above gathered host of planes of oun Air Guard circling around puzzled by what they saw below
Had they only dropped their bombs then much bloodshed among our own people could have been avoided but quite naturally in this day of civilization they did no such thing
They had reported to Washington and had re ceived orders to make friendly overtures to the strange newcomers
One of the planes dropped be low the formation and began to spiral down
few feet away from me one of the squat guns coughed
blinding flash appeared some fifty feet away from the circling plane which was irresis tibly sucked into it
There was miniature thun derclap and the twisted incandescent wreckage of the plane dropped like stone
Another gun coughed hollowly and another blinding glare of light appeared this time in the middle of the formation above
It sucked in three planes and their broken twisted remains also plunged earthward
Then our planes dived their motors roaring
There was sudden consternation among the white skinned men around me
Guns coughed frantically
Hastily aimed bombs flashed blinding even when seen against the bright sky
Two more planes col lapsed but the rest dived on
More guns coughed
The attention of my guards diverted for the moment hurled myself headlong toward the nearest gun whose crew was about to dis charge it
caught the feet of the creature whose hand was reaching out toward the firing mechanism upset him and rolled instantly to my feet tugging at the automatic in the holster on my thigh
got it out in time to fire point blank at another who leaped at me
He reeled and no ticed as he went down that though the skins of these strange people were white their blood was red enough
took toll of seven before they finally pinned me down and my little diversion at least kept one of their guns out of action while the planes sprayed the groups of soldiers with leaden hail cutting them down by the score
Then the planes zoomed again to comparative safety
By now however the invaders machines that looked like searchlights got into action
They spread fanlike beams of iridescence overhead
These beams the operators quickly wove into an in terlocking network making virtually continuous cone of pulsing light its base the circle on which the machines had been set up and its apex about thousand feet in the air
The planes of the Air Guard returned to the at tack this time dropping bombs as they passed over head
broke into cold sweat
knew the power of those bombs and figured my life in terms of split seconds
Then an amazing thing happened
The downrushing bombs bounced off the conecurtain of light as though from an invisible rubber wall and exploded harmlessly
Not even the fragments showered around for these too bounced off in their turn
But the invaders were close to panic from the earsplitting force of the ex plosions and they manipulated their coughing guns in very ragged fashion
Through the uproar their leaders rushed about an grily beating them back to the posts they had aban doned
saw more than one of them strike down man with his short heavy sword
Not until the Air Guard planes had expended all their ammunition did they withdraw to the foot level where again they circled watchfully
Altogether seven planes of the Air Guard had been shot down
About three hundred of the men of Venus lay killed and wounded within the circle
All these casualties however had been suffered prior to the formation of the protecting lights cone which had thrown off bombs and bullets alike rendering the sec ond attack of our planes quite futile although seem ingly terrific
CHAPTER II Ultimatum
NTENSE activity on the part of the invaders followed the withdrawal of the Air Guard squadron
vast mass of machinery was re moved from the sphere which actually was taken apart in the process
Its plates and beams had
been cleverly designed as interchangeable parts of other machines and constructive apparatus
Quickly in terchangeable at that
dont think it took more than an hour or so for the thousand men of Venus who were not casualties or assigned to the task of ministering to the wounded to completely demolish the great bulb in which they had arrived on Earth
In its place there arose giant cranes and compli cated machines which began to dig and handle ma terials in huge masses with uncanny skill and accu racy
In the center of the circle was erected cylindri cal apparatus which proved to be boring machine
By some complicated process that was beyond my comprehension it began to dig great well the dis placed earth literally flowing from openings in the side of the thing
As the mound of earth grew around it the cylinder automatically rose in the center of this mound
Other machines which squatted like huge metal lic insects occasionally raising themselves on leg like levers to change their positions reached out with great extension arms that terminated in uni versaljointed paddles or hands each probably fifteen feet across and scooped vast quantities of the earth toward the outer part of the mound
Before long the removed earth assumed the pro portions of hill
The circular battery of fanray machines was moved outward the number of ma chines being augmented by constantly assembled additions
Then noticed that the character of the earth flowing from the boring machine was changing
In few minutes molten lava was pouring out of the SCIENCE WONDER STORIES broadlipped spouts
There ensued unusual activity on the part of the shovelhanded machines whose operators with skill that held me enthralled man ipulated the liquid stone absorbing the heat from it with accessory apparatus and shaping it as it hardened
Night fell and the glow of the lava lighted the scene weirdly tinting the dead white bodies of the invaders
By now they were mostly stripped
With the setting of the sun they had begun to remove their protective diverlike suits and goggled hel mets and for the most part were clad only in full cut short trousers not unlike kilts that extended in pleats from highly ornamented broad belts to point several inches above the knee
There were many women among them
In fact about third of them were women but there was no distinction between their dress or lack of it and that of the men
Both men and women wore their tawny yellow hair close cropped
Nor did there seem to be any division of labor among them that was based on sex
All were working under high pressure at various machines except the executives those who were tending the wounded and the three guards who never let me get beyond their reach
They permitted me free movement however with in the confines of the circle so long as did not approach any of the machines too closely or get in the way of the bustling parties
That more would be heard from our planes that night know well
The traditions of the Air Guard particularly the American Division did not embrace much consideration of the principle of watchful waiting
had just looked at my watch it was nine oclock when something white little weighted parachute floated down right through the cone of the fan rays which spread faint iridescence through the air above us
whitebodied girl ap proached it hesitatingly inspected it where it lay and at last reassured picked it up and ran with it to the commander
knew what it was note an ultimatum offer ing truce or war to the invaders
When the com mander looked casually at it handed it back and with word waved the girl away had pretty good idea of what would follow
The Air Guard would be watching through their night scopes and probably would get good view of his action for he was standing well in the open and in the glow of the lava
moan from above swelled into roar
My heart skipped beat
It was one of those twoton inflammite bombs
The bombs dropped previously were as pills by comparison
That it would burst through that inverse magnetic film of the fan rays by sheer momentum had no doubt
But it didnt
With horrible whooping shriek it rebounded to one side and detonated two or three hundred feet away the shriek and the stunning de tonation blending in vast earsplitting sound
The fanray film threw off the big steel can and its fragments but it offered no resistance to the force of the explosion
The people of Venus nearest that side of the circle were literally blown from their feet and lay mangled and bleeding
There followed period of silence no less stun ning than the explosion
Then the invaders leaped to work
Under snarling barking commands of their leaders they rushed to replace several of the fanray machines that had been blown from their mounts while the operators of the remainder raised the angles of their beams to make the cone as large as possible
Fluttering and swinging jiown through the film came another little parachute message
Their com mander did not have to know any Earth language to grasp its meaning
But he did not seem to
Or if he did no other course than ignoring it entered into his calculations
Again he waved aside the bearer of the message angrily
The invaders once more were near panic but their discipline held
Suits and helmets were don ned hastily
The coughing guns were manned and began to hurl their queer suction bombs upward into the black night
These projectiles noticed passed freely through the fanray film
Hell From Heaven ROUND the circle machines were hastily man ned to drive diagonal wells into the ground
In these the ray machines were placed for safety
The work that was accomplished in the next ten minutes was astounding
The men of Venus were almost ready for the heavy bombardment when it broke and their suction bombs were flashing with blinding rapidity against the dark sky above
could well imagine that our air guard were having no picnic with them
Their flashing would have served to half blind pilot
Then hell dropped from heaven One by one at intervals of less than second the twoton bombs fell
They were thrown off at various angles from the cone film but being set for contact detonation did not rebound to great distances
threw myself to the ground with my arms wrapped around my head and lay there half stun ned
lost consciousness at the expiration of short interval
dont know how long it was be fore came to
But as staggered to my feet those about me were doing the same
There was no in dication of our planes overhead and the faint iri descence of the cone film was unbroken
Many of the machines sprawled about overturned and wrecked
And at several spots within the circle could see parts of our planes which evidently had been wrecked by the coughing guns
Fully half the original fifteen hundred invaders were now casualties
But the remainder tirelessly took up the task of repairing the damage and carry ing on their construction work
And such wonders did they accomplish with their strange machinery that dawn rose on terraced castlelike structure of solid and cooled lava circular about thousand feet across and rising to squat tower in the THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS center the top of which was some two hundred feet above the level of the plain
An encircling ring of fanray machines buried deeply in diagonallycut trench spread their cone shaped faintly visible protection above the struc ture and far enough away from it to render the ex plosion even of such bombs as had been hurled dur ing the night relatively harmless
was dragged within this fortress and locked in bare cell from which had restricted view through narrow porthole facing the north
Within my range of vision few sentries covered from head to foot in their peculiar suits patrolled the terraces pausing now and again to gaze through instruments that looked like complicated reflex tele scopes mounted on tripods
But the main body must have been within the walls sleeping off their exhaustion for aside from the sentries saw no one
Exhausted myself dropped to the hard floor and fell asleep
CHAPTER III Unearthly Colonies GREAT deal of history was made in the two months was held prisoner
But learned little until afterward of the manner in which the invaders who had peppered the world with col onies similar to the one in which was incarcer ated finally consolidated their strength in the tropi cal sections of Central and South America
Most of their bulbs had descended about thousand miles north or south of the Equator
Sev eral had landed in the United States
Some of these had been overwhelmed at once when their crews showed fight and before they could assemble and bring into action their fanray machines or their coughing guns and suction bombs
Others had managed for several days to stave off the AirGuard and LandGuard cordons which closed around them
One had held out as long as two weeks
Once their fan rays were in operation they were most difficult to subdue
In each case where the AirGuard did not succeed in annihilating themi at the outset with inflammite pills they finally had to be overpowered by massed infantry attacks
In these attacks our Guard suffered tremendous los ses for as they passed through the fanray zones their rifles and side arms were wrenched from their grasp by the repelling effect of the inverse magnetic forces
The men were forced to cast aside all equipment con taining metal of any description and to meet the sol diers of Venus with bare hands rocks and such hastily improvised clubs as they could get hold of as they ad vanced whereas the planetary invaders already safe behind their magnetic film were not handicapped in the use of metal weapons and their deadly vacuum gre nades
The European divisions of the Caucasian Federation were not on the whole so successful as the American in coping with the invaders while in Asia and other parts of the world the invaders had things pretty much their own way
Later as they assembled their aircraft and got their earthly bearings better they abandoned their outlying lava forts and mobilized in the tropical regions of the Western Hemisphere where the weather conditions were more suited to them and where they achieved such concentration of forces that the most powerful of the hastily organized at tacks of the American Air Guard reinforced from Europe were decisively repulsed
Then ensued that lull in hostilities that preceded the final conflict
But all this is matter of general history where as this account is primarily concerned with my own experiences
Skins Like Fish HE first week of my incarceration was rather dull
My jailer was middle aged man of ab normal cerebral development
Most of the food he brought me turned my stomach filthy messes of partially decomposed animal and vegetable matter
There were certain vital physiological differences between the men of Venus and those of Earth and as matter of fact the fare that was brought me was in full conformity with their standards of whole someness and palatability
My jailer pestered me continuously forcing me to utter the names of everything he could point but to me or show me pictures of
They had some very clever photographic process that enabled them to take telescopic pictures of great clarity and accu racy
From the names of objects he probed me for words denoting action and so on until much to my surprise at the end of no less than month he addressed me One day in halting but unmistakable English
Your speech has been very hard to learn he informed me because it is so involved and much less direct than ours though it has the advantage that you have fewer words to remember This was the gist of his speech
dont remem ber the exact words he used except that they were very funny and also very ingenious in the associa tion of ideas through which he made his meaning clear
But after this he did not bring my food any more
Instead young girl was assigned to the task
She informed me haltingly that she was learning my speech
Let me teach
you suggested
She smiled at this but shook her head negatively
can learn more quickly from the miorurlia she Said
And at the end of another week she was speak ing better English than the man had
She told me was considered something of prize for though their colonies had captured sev eral thousand Earth men most of them had rated low in intelligence and they had only two or three altogether who spoke English
Her name she said was Nyimeurnior
She quiz zed me untiringly about life on the Earth and since her questions covered the entire range of engineer ing medicine sociology history commerce and in SCIENCE WONDER STORIES dustry as well as political economy was rather hard put to give satisfactory answers
But in turn she freely discussed her own race with me
She found it difficult to understand why the food they had been giving me was nauseating to me and this led to long discussion of many physiological differences between Earth men and the men of Venus
That there were such differences was not unprepared to learn since there were such differ ences in physical appearance
On the whole the invaders were trifle smaller of stature and bigger of head than ourselves
Their foreheads were higher their eyes bit larger and their noses mouths and chins though regular and beautifully molded bit smaller in proportion
At that however have seen Earth men who could have passed for these people were it not for the difference of coloring
They were as dead white as marble statues ex cept for tawny yellow eyes and hair
And might mention that they had no hair anywhere upon their bodies except upon their heads where it grew thickly
Both men and women wore it cropped very short
This dead white skin of theirs was thicker than ours but was also very soft and normally should have been moist not from perspiration but from the absorption of moisture from the air
This absorp tion rather than excretion appeared to be the prin cipal function of their pores
They could of course and actually did drink great deal of water during their life on Earth but the sensation was very unpleasant to them and they drank only of necessity because their pores could not absorb from the relatively dry atmosphere of the Earth the amount of water they needed
Rule or Ruin HEY needed considerably more heat also than our climate furnished anywhere except in the tropics
This was the reason for their decision to withdraw those colonies which like the one in which was held prisoner were located in more temperate regions
It was also the reason why they contemplated no immediate conquest of the Earth but planned to remain on the defensive in their tropic strongholds until such time as they might better adapt themselves to Earthly condi tions and increase their numbers
In the meantime however it was their intention
Nyimeurnior told me to keep the Earth men busy with destructive air raids
They had anticipated finding the Earths atmos phere different from their own of course and know ing that it would be considerably drier had equip ped themselves with waterproof suits which cov ered them from head to foot
These suits served the purpose of humidors
They were also an absolute essential as protec tion from the Earthly daylight
Our atmosphere lacking the fog filters of that of Venus lets through certain rays of the sun which though almost ne cessity of life to Earth beings are rank poison to Venus animal and plant life
Does the sunlight never break through the cloud layers of Venus asked Nyimeurnior
Not ever she replied quaintly
Our daylight is very bright and very warm because Venus is so much closer to the Sun than Earth
But the air is very full of water like the fog you tell me you have in other parts of Earth and like these clouds that sometimes pass above us here and it is never you are able to see for greater distances than what you call quarter of mile
Before we came to Earth we knew sunlight only from sending what do you say
scientific expeditions up through the clouds many many that is very great dis tance Exposure to sunlight even for very short time was deadly to the people of Venus
had occasion to observe this for myself later
It did not bum them in the way that overexposure does Earth men for they had no pigmentation in their skins whatever
But it did pull the blood right out through the pores so that after time they became horrible spectacles
But even more deadly than this was its toxic effect upon them
It deranged their nervous systems and stimulated them to hysteri cal fever which was quickly followed by torpor and if relief measures were not applied promptly by death
half an hour unprotected from the rays of the sun would turn the hardiest man of Venus into driedout bloodcaked corpse
An hour or two hours in normal daylight out of the direct rays of the sun would do the same though they suffered little dis comfort in going abroad when it was storming or the skies were heavily overcast
Naturally they were not happy in the Earth at mosphere
Nyimeurnior told me that they wore very little clothing on Venus and hated the feel of the humidor suits they were forced to wear out of doors in the daytime on Earth
But there was no help for that
They simply kept under cover all they could during the day in their artificially hu midified structures adopting schedule of night work
But even at this the chill of the night out doors was playing havoc with the health of the community and before many more days she in formed me they would abandon the lava fort and migrate in the airships they had built since my in carceration to the city which other communities were even now completing in the fastnesses of the tropical forests of Brazil
cannot understand Nyimeurnior said one day why your people refused all overtures of peace
Our Earth nations are not bloodthirsty
We do not kill for the sake of killing
There have been many wars in the past owing to the fact that men cannot always agree on everything but in the main Earth men live at peace with one another and know they would be willing to live at peace with your people if you would show the right spirit
There is much in which we could help you much that we could teach you as there is much that we could learn from you
It would be to the mutual advantage of both races THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS The girl looked at me queerly
Her pretty little mouth closed in grim line
She made no reply whatever but arose and left my cell immediately evidently in anger
never thoroughly understood this attitude on their part nor have ever heard that any one else ever did
During the time was prisoner tried to suggest the idea of truce to their leaders as fre quently as could
But it seemed as though their consciousness was utterly and mysteriously barred to its consideration
The only reply ever got was blow in the face or look betokening sus picion that was mentally unbalanced
Dont ask me why
cant explain it
But certain it is that from the day the first bulb fell into our atmosphere until that final day when our armies millions strong surged irresistibly through the Brazilian forests not once did they make an overture of peace or indicate that they would accept any mercy from us
They simply could not grasp the idea that was all
For several days after made this suggestion to Nyimeurnior she would not speak to me
She brought my food healthful Earth food now not the sickly messes they had given me at first and left as quickly as possible
It was as though had offered her some gross personal insult that had filled her with loathing of me
Mushroom Ships HIS didnt bother me much however
To those who had any personal contact with the invad ers dont have to explain why
But for the benefit of those who never saw one at close range might say that though found the girl interest ing and though could even go so far as to refer to her as pretty anything like romantic interest in her was an utter impossibility
Imagine if you can being in love with girl with deadwhite moist clammy skin like the belly of scaleless fish bloodless lips and smoky yellow eyes that somehow reminded you of those of cat although the shape of the eyelids was human enough
Nyimeurniors attitude did not disturb my emotions in the least though it piqued my curiosity greatly
Gradually however she appeared to forget the insult Her interest in information about the Earth served to renew our conversations
Perhaps she was ordered to resume them
She told me about their airships mushroomlike affairs in which the space for the crew and cargo corresponded with the stem and the elevating ma chinery is built into the umbrellalike superstruc ture
They could rise in straight vertical line like helicopters move slowly and gently or hover mo tionless
Speedy aircraft she explained would be suicidal in the fogs of Venus
was amazed at her description of the manner in which they were supported
Air on the upper sur face of the umbrella was destroyed by electronic action thus forming an upsucking vacuum
It was recreated electronically on the under surface of the umbrella thus forming supporting cushion of compressed air which though constantly dissipat ing was being replenished with equal rapidity
It was only necessary to vary the speed of the pro cess to rise or fall
Automatic compensators con stantly adjusted the vacuum and pressure at vari ous points on the umbrella surface always keeping the ship in perfect balance
If anything went wrong with the electronic apparatus the ship merely cme down like an ordinary parachute
Horizontal propellers furnished motive power
With the clear air of Earth through which to fly she said their engineers were increasing the ratio of motive power and her own community had suc ceeded in obtaining speed of miles an hour with its ships
This was less than half the speed of our Air Guard patrol planes and less than three quarters that of our bombers
We are saving you to teach us about planes Nyimeurnior said
Saving me from what asked
She looked at me in surprise
From death of course she replied
Why should we be wasting food and trouble on you if we could not make use of you Would you not spare my life from motives of mercy asked
Mercy she repeated questioningly in her pe culiar pronunciation that is word we have not spoken of before
What does it mean tried to explain to her but quite unsuccessfully
The best she could make of the idea of sparing an enemy of whom no profitable use could be made was that it was manifestation of ignorance or in sanity
began to realize that these people had no conception of charity sympathy or kindness as spontaneous emotions although they approximated the practical manifestations of the emotions from motivation of expediency
delved further and found that they were unfa miliar with love except as an intellectually selfish emotion
husband was kind to his wife for in stance because he needed her help and cooperation and realized that she could give this more efficiently under the influence of consideration and comforts than with mind or body deranged by harsh treat ment
If she lost her usefulness to him he put her away on sort of pension arrangement
He did not kill her because that would make other women fear him and he might have difficulty in getting an other wife
On the other hand wife was helpful and considerate of her husband because she realized it was to her interest to cooperate fully with him
And naturally the most kind and considerate of the young men and young women were in the great est demand as husbands and wives
But back of all their courtesy and consideration was nothing but an acutely developed self interest tied up with peculiarly keen appreciation of the values of cooperation and an ability to weigh and balance those values undisturbed by emotion far SCIENCE WONDER STORIES in advance of any similar ability on the part of Earth men
They had only one true emotion physical fear
They were very susceptible to it
As compensation they had high order of intellectual courage
The fact that they had risked journey through space attested that
But their physical susceptibility to fear in moments of emergency was far greater han dicap to their balance and judgment than is the case with the average of Earth men
Fear tended to paralyze rather than stimulate them to action
Intellectually they steeled themselves from early childhood against this weekness but with only partial success
It was quite plain to me as result of this partial insight into their psychology gained from Nyimeur nior that had my choice of ultimate death or playing traitor to my country my world and my fellow man by teaching them to make and fly air planes
For strange as it may seem at first thought Earth men despite the comparative newness of their me chanical civilization held an advantage in the air from military point of view with their swift darting planes though it may be conceded that for general convenience and comfort the Venus um brella ship was superior
Having developed their navigation of the air along totally different lines for centuries the new comers had nothing more than an elementary grasp of the principles underlying the construction and use of planes
CHAPTER IV The Judgment of the Nyapacleur HAD no intention however of either turning traitor or sacrificing my life
So began to maneuver for chance at freedom
Not long after had come to this conclusion was take before the Nyapacleur or commander of the community whose position with allowance made for the highly organized and mechanically perfected civilization of Venus was not unlike that of feudal baron
That is to say he held the power of life and death over the entire community
The members according to the Venus theory owed all their necessities and comforts as well as their very lives to the skill and strength of his leadership
They in turn owed those lives to him if ever he should choose to call for them
This Nyapacleurs name was Lourmon
He was the same before whom had been taken for brief instant in the sphere which had brought the com munity from Venus
Nyimeurnior and my first jailer whose name learned was Founyi acted as interpreters
The room in which he gave me audience was not unlike an office
He sat at kind of desk on which however the usual mass of papers was re placed by number of mechanical contrivances which judged were various forms of recording and reporting devices
The air in the room was warm and highly humid
Lourmon naked except for the peculiar belt and shorts the invaders wore and kind of sandal was such an incongruous figure from my Earthly point of view that could not help smiling
Imagine if you can near Grecian statue come to life and leaning carelessly over table piled with modern scientific instruments
He glanced at me keenly and spoke few words in that soft slurring tongue of theirs which was form of language which no race on Earth has yet developed except for purposes of writing
By that mean that it was not the original or natural speech of these people but species of shorthand through which entire sentences and paragraphs might be summed up in single word or two or three words
One of my great regrets is that had so little op portunity to learn it
These few words Founyi translated into nearly five minutes of his slow English reviewing in de tail the account of my capture referring more briefly to the journey of the invaders through space and the reasons which led them to attempt it out lining their determination and confidence in their ability to exterminate Earth men and take over the world for themselves and setting forth my individ ual helplessness and the wisdom of endeavoring to make myself useful slave if desired to preserve my life
While Founyi was translating Lourmon clearly impatient at the handicaps of such slow and clumsy language was abstractedly manipulating the levers of little apparatus which was presenting to him series of pictures on little translucent screen
At the end of Founyis speech he looked questioningly at me as though taking my con sent for granted
had decided to appear to agree for only in such source could see any possibility of being per mitted enough freedom of movement to plan for my escape
But did not want to seem to give in too readily
It would be more convincing thought if were persuaded only reluctantly after more elaborate threats and promises
In this however made blunder
Lourmon leaped to his feet in rage when did not instantly agree
Myarrip He fairly snarled the word at me
He says Nyimeurnior explained calmly that you are fool but that since you are only an Earth man he will give you one more chance to think it over and make better use of what little intelligence you have
He does this not from any motive of mercy or justice to you for as prisoner you are not entitled to any rights or claims whatever but on the contrary are indebted to him already for several weeks existence
He does it merely because he needs information you can give him and he is willing to sacrifice even his dignity on the chance that you will ultimately give it to him freely
But this sacrifice of dignity in not ordering your execu tion immediately he will hold against you as debt
If you do not change your mind you will be tor THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS tured and the secrets of the Earth airplanes dragged from yott was so amazed at the volume of meaning the girl translated from the Nyapacleurs single word that forgot to play my role and instead of con senting at once stood there with an open mouth like the fool Lourmon had called me trying to figure out how much language actually had been packed into two syllables and how much was so to speak embroidery added to it by the girl from her knowledge of the situation
Lourmon made vicious little gesture and my two interpreters led me back to my cell
Youre not such low mentality as he believes you the girl remarked
Unless too have mis judged you you will accept
If you decide to be fore the next mealtime just knock on the panel
The guard outside will be instructed to take you to Lourmon who will not need any speech from you but just sign of assent With that she stepped from my cell to the corridor and shot the panel across
Escape HpHlS arrangement thought would give me my opportunity
glanced through the tiny win dow of my cell
brilliant morning sun flooded the half mile or so of bare plain and the rugged rocky country beyond
Why should wait to build up little by little any elaborate plan of gaining more and more freedom of movement within the castle until finally could make an opportunity of escape
It would be better to risk all on bold stroke
After the first day the sentries had given up pa trolling the open terraces in the daytime even in their cleverly constructed humidor suits
Two of them had died from it
Instead had been in formed by Nyimeurnior they were safely ensconced in little turrets which they could enter only from within the fortress and from these they scanned the sky with their telescopic instruments carefully shielded with ray filters for signs of the Earth mens airplanes turning their attention occasionally to the rough country surrounding the little plain on which the fortress was located
Once got clear in the open sunlight the in vaders would certainly find it difficult to pursue me
My danger would be chiefly that they might launch an umbrella ship after me
Indecision is not frequent fault among us of the Air Guard
rapped on the door at once hop ing that my guard would be big fellow for his race and be wearing his humidor suit
Footsteps approached and the panel swung back
He thrust his head in the cell and beckoned me to follow him
seized and jerked him into the room
It would have been easy to knock him out with blow on the jaw if it had not been for his helmet
But finally managed to knock this off as we scuffled and then few well directed blows put him out
stripped the fellow of his humidor suit
Luck was with me for though he was not as large as his suit was bit large for him and with some diffi culty was able to squeeze into it
Placing the helmet over my head belted on his weapons which consisted of short sword and couple of what took to be small vacuum grenades
Then stepped boldly through the panel door into the passageway
Nobody was in sight
From distance some place below there came to me through the network of corridors and up the ramps which was used in place of stairs the sounds of large body of men marching
Grad ually this sound lessened and since at the same time heard confused clamor through the outlet ventilators judged that detail of men had been sent outside the castle
This was strange for it was broad daylight and the sun was shining brightly
knew that some thing important must be afoot to take the soldiers of enus out into the sun even with the protection of their humidor suits and helmets
After some search through the deserted upper levels of the structure found lookout turret from which could get good view of the surrounding plain
It was typical view of that section of Mexico broad plain quivering in the sunlight for the most part arid and bare but with occasional islands of rocky protuberances and patches of poverty stricken mesquite
Far to the West at point which was practically the limit of my vision saw another of the lava fortresses
The sky above it was filled with little flashes of light and puffs of smoke indicating that an attack was being made upon it
Ai gazed giant dirigible of the Air Guard in its lowvisibility war paint swung broadside on to my line of vision materializing as it were out of an empty sky
There followed series of detonations so heavy that could actually feel the air vibrate
But apparently not even these heavy bombs could break through the fanray film which the invaders had spread above themselves
The little flashes and smoke puffs continued both aloft and below
glanced downward at the gate of the fortress which might mention here was not unlike that of medieval castle if you can imagine one of those old European fortresses done over again in modern factory construction style
column of soldiers had issued forth and was winding its way across the plain in the direction of the beleaguered fortress
But what interested me most keenly about the column was the method used of protecting it from air attack
In the center marched column of infantry
To either side of them column of fanray machines which lumber ed along on leverlike legs with motion not un like the lurching of our own tanks their generators all turned outward spreading fan of rays almost horizontal over the tops of still two other flanking columns of machines
These outside columns play ed their rays upward and inward over the center
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES of the column the two filmls of rays crossing and furnishing complete protection
The only way in which that column could be reached by steel projectiles of any description was from the ground at flat trajectory
So interested did become in the attack on the column which was certain would follow that forgot the pressing need of making my escape and stood there gazing
From somewhere behind and above there came steady hissing roar
Four Venus airships came into view taking up their positions to the rear of the column at height of about half mile
Nyi meurnior had described these ships to me but this was the first had seen of them
They were up right cylinders some fifty feet in height and about thirty feet in diameter crowned by an umbrella like structure hundred feet in diameter and sev eral feet thick
It was from the top surface that the air was being electronized into vacuum to be rematerialized on the concave under surface
If it were not for the light projecting and brac ing steel beams which helped to hold the affairs rigid and also provided landing gear which would not offer the same resistance to the air as solid platform the things would have looked like giant floating mushrooms
They too floated in what was practically an en velope of inverse magnetic rays the generators be ing so placed as to cause the beams or rays to cross in every direction
They hung in the air above the column calmly awaiting the swooping attack of our Air Guard
When it came it was sudden enough
Seven squadrons of planes dove headon at the Venus ships spitting steady hail of projectiles zooming successively when they had almost reached the fan ray film
But it did no good
The projectiles bounced off that nearly invisible film like rubber balls from concrete wall
Fruitless Attack WANTED to shout at them to use nonmetallic projectiles to which knew these rays would offer no resistance but of course it was ridiculous to suppose they could hear me
As matter of fact could not even signal them for was shut up in the lookout turret
It was the frantic desire to get this information to my own side which finally prompted me to tear myself away from my point of vantage
Even as did so saw one of our planes collide with the magnetic wall and hurtle down crumpled thing while another caught within the effective radius of one of the suction bombs also crumpled and fell
Leaving the lookout turret hurried down through the corridors and ramps with little fear that my disguise would be penetrated soldiers en countered several times
had learned much of the manners customs and courtesies of these peo ple from Nyimeurnior and gloved and helmeted as was was covered from head to foot
Nothing but the most searching gaze through my helmet goggles would have revealed the fact that did not have dead white skin
At last reached the passage through which the column had passed but short time before
There was sentry on guard just inside the big gate which still was open but he was gazing out after the departing column
simply elbowed him aside and trotted out over the plain as though were tardy member of the expedition hurrying to catch up to the column
stole glance back over my shoulder
The plan had worked
He had not been alarmed by my action
was careful however not to catch up to the column but bore off toward the North when was sure no attention was being paid to me
Then removed the helmet and stripped off the humidor suit which was great relief
think that half an hour longer in that moisture proof garb under the blazing Mexican sun would have drowned or smothered me in my own perspiration
From somewhere to the Northwest an artillery barrage was laid down on the invaders column
For moment had thrill of elation
From the confusion it produced thought it had succeeded in crashing through the magnetic wall
But it had not
There was the usual result shells bouncing harmlessly off and exploding in the air above the column
The confusion evidently was produced by the surprise of the bombardment and the noise for the battery was long distance away and well hidden
For while the column halted and the men cowered
But few seemed to take any real alarm
In the end the machines resumed their sluggish progress while the infantry staggered and crouched their way forward quite safe from the explosions above them but far from enjoying it
Farther on the column was ambushed by de tachment of our infantry
Simultaneously another attack was launched on it from the air
But no success attended the efforts of the Earth men
number of the Venus ray generators were raised on extension platforms and the direction of the rays depressed
And could see that not even flat trajectory fire could reach the column
As the climax of the attack the planes above withheld their fire and the Ground Guard threw three waves of infantry against the column but only to wither away under the suction bombs of the coughing guns with which the Venusians met them
The Earth forces withdrew at last after suffering consider able loss and the men of the column probably with frazzled nerves but with little physical damage continued to wend their tortuous painful way across the plain and entered the other fortress
All this time had been making my way North ward until finally passed out of sight of the two castles
That night built code signal fire and inside half an hour was picked up by highangle plane which dropped down beside me
THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS CHAPTER The Great Retreat result of radio orders was sent to Wash ington at once to report to the Ordnance Board
The knowledge had gained of the invaders their methods and their machines proved invaluable
Not that the Air and Land Guard General Boards had not already determined the fact that special projectiles and equipment would be necessary to penetrate the defensive rays of the invaders but was able to verify many of their con clusions correct certain others and generally ex pand the fund of knowledge that already had been gathered by the Intelligence Division
had busy two weeks hopping from one office to another on special detail and events moved swiftly in those two weeks
was myself amazed at the speed with which new guns and new non metallic shells and bombs were being turned out and the ingenuity shown by the scientific depart ments of the Guard and by manufacturers in de veloping nonmetallic bayonet
Troops had to be equipped with canteens belt buckles head gear and buttons and fastenings on their uniforms which had no metal in their con struction
The rifle it was determined could not be abandoned but nonmetallic cartridges were de veloped
The theory was that in passing through the magnetic film of the Venusians for handto hand fighting the troops would drop their rifles and use the detached swordbayonets
Naturally these things could not be produced overnight nor could the troops be trained in new tactics overnight but so intensively was the work of manufacturing and drilling prosecuted that at the end of two weeks many regiments of the Land Guard had been reorganized and about tenth of the Air Guard had been supplied with nonmetallic bombs
During this period however the two fortresses with which had been concerned were abandoned their communities drifting lazily and safely South ward in their mushroom ships as did many others finally settling in the interior of Brazil
Perhaps should pause here to summarize the sequence of events up to this point
Nearly two weeks elapsed between the arrivals of the first and last of the bulbs
Seventytwo of them landed in the United States in Canada in Scandinavia in England in France in Germany in Italy in the Balkans and hun dreds in the tropic belt all the way around the Earth
Throughout Western Europe the Leagues land and air forces got into relatively quick action against them
As fast as new spheres descended they were walled in by rings of troops and roofed over as it were by clouds of aircraft
The one which fell in England was destroyed after two days
In France ninewere successfully bombed be fore they could get their inverse magnetic rays into operation
The crews ot the others managed under fire to erect their fortresses but were so worn out by the neverending bombardments to which they were subjected that they were finally overcome by the charging waves of infantry who had been armed with wooden clubs and short spears
Twelve communities fled Southward in their air ships but ran into atmospheric conditions that were horrible to them in Northern Africa where the lack of humidity caused them terrible losses
Of the hundreds that landed in Africa the major ity perished
The remainder made their way either Eastward or Westward around the Equator to the fastnesses of the Brazilian jungles where they con structed their great stronghold
At the end of three months none of the invaders remained anywhere in the civilized sections of the temperate zones
The story of those invaders who established themselves in such lands as Tibet and Siam and how they ultimately perished has not all been unearthed yet from the ruins
Fiftyseven of the colonies that fell in the United States were destroyed
The others fought their way through our air forces toward the Tropics
Then there ensued period of two months in which the invaders and Earth men were content to let matters rest while they took stock of the situa tion and prepared for the greater struggle to come
The men of Venus did very little of the raiding they had intended according to the plans Nyimeur nior had explained to me during my incarceration
Time and again our air fleets coursed over the Bra zilian forests but seldom did they find evidence of the enemys works
The invaders had learned well to conceal themselves under the leafy protection of the jungle
They had learned too to raise no lava fortresses where they could be seen from above and also to conceal the flow of their volcanic wells
They had little chance of meeting us successfully in the air now for our air fleets had been given bullets and projectiles of nonmetallic construction against which the fanrays of the invaders were of no avail and it became more matter of sport than anything else among us of the Air Guard to sight mushroom ship or squadron and shoot it down
Their suction bombs were destructive but we could move too fast for their ships and outclimb them easily
However according to the best estimates there were close to one million of them now established in the Brazil jungles where they were busily readjust ing themselves to Earth conditions constructing their ingenious machines and developing their re sources in preparation for future outbreak which we all feared would be far more devastating than the effects of their haphazard and uncoordinated activities at the time of their arrival upon Earth
The paucity of information on their movements in the jungle was ominous
Terrorstricken Indians staggered into the Brazilian military outposts with tales of wholesale and mysterious slaughter of mists that travelled purposefully through the jungles from which ghostmen emerged to slay
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES Brazilian military reconnoitering parties went out and failed to return
Once mist cloud moved out of the jungle and enveloped an outpost
When it retreated according to the story of soldier who had been outside the lines the entire garrison had been massacred
Yet these mists were never observed above the tree tops
The Earth Mobilizes HE Brazilian Government had made its formal appeal to the League fo
help according to the League Constitution and gigantic army recruited from all the nations in the League was to surround the vast jungle territory
Ten million men were to be used for though they would be opposing only about million of the enemy they would be fighting for nothing less than the existence of the human race and would be fac ing the unknown
This was the general situation
And while this immense army was being mobilized and equipped call was made for volunteers who had had contact with the enemy to attempt the highly dangerous work of penetrating the Brazilian forests as scouts and spies
And having no better sense volun teered
That was why found myself ensconced one night in the upper branches of tree far in the interior in section where had finally found evidences of activity
wore an imitation humidor suit that was an imitation only in its clever arrangement for ventilation
It was in fact real Venus garment which for the moment was suspended on my chest like an oldfashioned gas mask but was in reality gas mask and several other things besides
In my hands held little box tiny radio broadcasting set
Scattered around me through the forest at strategic points were carefully concealed bombs and flares each tuned so that by pressing the proper button on the box might set off any particular bomb or flare by radio impuse
had spent the day planting these mines among which were number of gas bombs
All these arrangements were precautions of self defense
had no intention of carrying on cam paign singlehanded
But had picked the spot for several days patient observation for it was here that had noted several fresh trails that appeared to my unwoodsmanlike eye to converge and come to an end for no reason whatever in little clearing not far from the tree in which was hiding
quarter of mile away carefully hidden had one of our new helicopters developed by the Air Guard machine that was powerful and as nearly silent in its operation as any device using an air propeller could be and far beyond sight great dirigible was awaiting my communications
But since nothing at all happened that night and no sounds came to my straining ears except those of the normal animal life of the jungle determined the next night to try an experiment
waited until after midnight and then pressed button on my radio control box which resulted in terrific explosion about quarter of mile farther on in the jungle
got the flash of it even through the dense growth of the jungle and my tree trem bled with the force of the detonation
Immediately there was series of purplish flashes in the sky above that spot which merged into continuous mass of pulsating lights as the prelim inary thunderclaps grew into continuous roar
My experiment had proved profitable
had learned something
knew those flashes and thunderclaps as the product of the coughing guns of the enemy
But the power of this barrage exceeded by far any thing had seen while prisoner among them
As suddenly as the uproar had begun it ceased
And silence once more settled over the jungle
It was evident that had stumbled into the neigh borhood of Venus artillery post and no mean one
My bomb had been mistaken for one dropped from an airplane
The next day searched for the loca tion of that battery but could not find it
The night following slept but devoted the day after that to another painstaking search of the jungle
At last found spot where the foliage of the trees above me appeared to have been shred ded and torn
searched the ground carefully
My patience was rewarded by the discovery of beau tifully designed camouflage screen of moss and leaves which concealed pit
The battery was buried under ground and fortunately for me must have been unmanned and unguarded at the mo ment although this did not surprise me knowing as did how the invaders hated our atmosphere in the daylight even when wearing their humidor suits
The gun crew was sure was also somewhere below ground probably sleeping and the sentry who must have had some post of vantage from which he could see the sky was evidently so placed that he could not observe the floor of the forest
As quietly as could and must admit with some fear slipped away to where one of my bombs was concealed and carried it carefully to the pit where concealed it in some undergrowth nearby
That night took up new post in tree from which could see the mouth of the pit and detonated another of my bombs some distance away
The phenomena of several nights before was re peated in the air but did not watch it this time
kept my attention centered upon the mouth of the pit
The screen had been blown aside and so fast was the buried gun firing it seemed to be only one that its discharges blended into continuous faint ly luminescent column that tore through the upper branches of the trees
After bit the gun ceased firing
About quarter of an hour elapsed
Then faint light appeared near the mouth of the pit by which could observe the figures of half dozen invaders
Two of them were nakedwhite in the soft warm tropical night but the others wore their suits and helmets
One of them was placing new screen over the THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS mouth of the gun pit
Others were carefully gath ering up the debris torn from the trees above
My first instinct was to slip to the ground and creep up on them
felt that in the darkness it would not be noticed that there was an additional member of their party and might be able to fol low them underground
But caution prevailed and determined first to communicate my discoveries to the dirigible somewhere in the sky above
We had planned an ingenious method of doing this
With the first grey light of dawn felt my way back through the jungle to the spot whre had left my helicopter for my radio would not have been powerful enough to reach the ship nor would have dared to use one for continuous message
The enemy might have picked it up and located me
The small amount of power and mere instan taneous spark that used to detonate my bombs did not matter
From one of the compartments of the helicopter took tiny model of the same sort equipped with little chemical engine
The whole thing was little bigger than cigar box
wrote my report and at tached it to the model which shot vertically into the air
When it was five thousand feet up it would automatically broadcast range finding signal and emit faint smoke trail which would enable one of our planes to pick it up
It would rise under its power for many hours then drift down on little parachute and finally if not picked up by the time it drifted below the foot level it would burn destroying the message
Into the Tunnel SLEPT the rest of the day for expected to be very busy that night
After nightfall return ed to my post near the gun pit but did not climb the tree
Instead hid behind its vast trunk and pressed the button that would detonate the bomb had placed near the gun pit
It blew great gash in the ground and must have put the gun out of commission for no roaring bar rage followed but short time afterward ten or twelve soldiers broke through screen of creepers and by the faint light of hand lamps excitedly in spected the crater my bomb had torn at the edge of their gun pit
They jabbered laconically in their strange shorthand tongue frequently pointing upward
circled and came up behind them joining their party yet not getting too close to the others as made pretense of searching the ground and look ing fearfully up toward the sky where only couple of stars were visible through the dense foliage
After bit their leader man bigger than the rest who had not donned his humidor suit grunted command and one by one they disappeared through the screen of creeping vines
approached with the rest but hung back bit hoping the commander would go in ahead of me
But he did not and in the end he grunted an angry command
He must have become suspicious as passed him
Possibly he had been counting and realized that he had an extra man
At any event he reached out and grasped my arm
But was on the alert for such danger
Twist ing quickly drove my fist against his unprotected jaw and he went down like log
And pushing my way through the screen found myself in cleverly concealed passageway which slanted down below the ground level
Following the lights of the others around couple of turns came upon section of corridor that was dimly lighted
After bit we came to junction of several corridors and the men turned sharply to the left down small tunnel
paused moment to take stock of this structure and if possible get my bearings
My little compass made several things clear
The tunnel the men had followed evidently led back to the gun pit
main corridor much larger stretched away in great curve to the South
An other curved gently Northward
And toward the West third one larger than any of the others slanted downward at sharp angle
In the big chamber where these corridors came together which incidentally reminded much of one of our old subway stations in New York were number of big complicated pieces of machinery
They were not in operation at the moment however
From down the big West shaft came distant murmur which little by little grew in intensity until finally thought it advisable to seek cover
hid behind one of the machines
The murmur grew into roar
The roar increased
And there shot out of the tunnel into the big sta tion where it came to an easy but quick stop great projectilelike car
It had no wheels but apparently rode on two systems of magnetic de vices one running like spine along the top the other like keel along the bottom
As noticed this the car settled down few inches and rested with bump on the lavalike floor
Several doors in the side opened and stream of soldiers began to troop out
At the same mo ment several of the gun crew came running out of the small corridor
They made their way imme diately to the commanding officer of the newcom ers evidently man of high rank from the breadth of the belt he wore and the numerous insignia ap pearing on it and made their report in some ex citement
They knew by now of course that their battery commander was missing
He replied angrily
gathered from his impa tient gestures that he was reprimanding them for not returning to the jungle to seek their officer
And realized was facing crisis
But dared not come from behind the machine to join the throng at this juncture for none of them was in humidor suit and would have attracted unwelcome attention instantly
was forced there fore to watch the squad which rushed off at once toward the exit to the forest and see my retreat cut off
It struck me that strategically speaking it was high time for diversion if on finding their com mander outside they were not to start an imme SCIENCE WONDER STORIES diate search of the tunnels
So drew my radio de tonator out and pressed one of its buttons then another and finally third
There was only one explosion which came to my ears faintly and muffled from point some three hundred yards away in the forest
The other two bombs would make no noise
One was smoke bomb which would so smother their hand lamps that they would hardly be able to see their hands before their faces
The third was gas bomb and would give those who breathed its fumes some thing new to think about hoped for as long as they were able to think
As expected detachment of only twelve men or so was sent out to investigate
Another detach ment armed with tools and implements of various descriptions ran down the corridor toward the gun pit and soon the sound of their apparatus was clanging in my ears
party from the gun pit came back and after reporting to the commander who was pacing up and down impatiently ran to one of the machines near that behind which was hiding
They swarmed over it manipulating little wheels and levers
And to my surprise the mass of ma chinery which reminded me something of small newspaper printing press lumbered to leverlike feet and shambled away down the tunnel to the pit
Every few moments the commander glanced im patiently toward the forestexit corridor
Finally he motioned to one of the girls in the ranks behind him for as mentioned before they seemed to make no distinction as to sex when it came to labor or military service and she ran off toward the exit
But she did not return
Nor did any of the others
opined that my gas was working nicely and now bitterly regretted that had failed to fill my pouch with gas grenades from my helicopter
At last the officer barked an order
The rest of the soldiers broke ranks unstrapped their humidor suits from their belts and donned them
Another order and they all moved briskly away toward the exit trailing their short spears
slipped into the rearmost ranks and went along with them for my purpose now was to regain my helicopter and send up another message to the dirigible explaining what had seen of their corridors and system of underground structures
CHAPTER VI Guerilla Warfare HE head of the column passed out through the screen of creepers
Others followed
Then suddenly the column recoiled
Some of those nearest the screen sank down gasping and choking
Others staggered and leaned against the walls
Through the confusion could see that some of them had torn away the foliage of the screen re vealing the piled up bodies beyond
At this moment gust of wind sent billow of the black smoke surging into the corridor
The rest of the column turned and fled from it crowding back down the corridor
chuckled as crouched to let them pass my gas mask in place for remembered the rumors that had reached us of these people leaping from white fogs that roamed the surface of the jungle
The black fog and deadly gases of Earth laborato ries were reversing the terror
As the last of the fleeing enemy disappeared around the bend in the corridor arose and made my way to the outer blackness where stumbled around for more than an hour before won free from my own black fog and gas and located my helicopter
At dawn shot another baby heli up with my report and filled my pouches with gas and smoke grenades
wanted to return and get more com prehensive idea of the extent of their corridor sys tems for was convinced by now that the whole invaders population had taken to burrowing into the Earth
In digging their volcanic shafts it would be no impossible task for them to adapt their won derful machines for fashioning the lava product into underground corridors and chambers instead of the castles or fortresses they had first built above ground
If this were the case our armies were going to have some little task ahead of them in dig ging them out
did not have an opportunity to pursue my inves tigations further at that time however for had hardly turned from my helicopter when became conscious of the slight continuous buzz in my radio box that was the prearranged signal ordering my return to the dirigible
So regretfully climbed into the machine start ed the motor and opening the throttle roared up through the tree tops
Before had gone far was sighted by the enemy and suction bombs began to burst around me
Stunned by the thunderclap of one of these lost consciousness not to awake until several hours later in one of the bunks of the dirig ible
For several weeks thereafter all saw of the war was from the air
was attached to one of the new superdirigibles as plane scout
The was one of the first of those dirigibles that kept permanently to the air and docked only at in frequent periods as the battleships of old took to their dry docks only for repairs
The big ship cruised above the utmost range of the coughing guns and most of the time was unable to see the surface of the ground owing to atmospheric condi tions
regular patrol was maintained however
and fifteen other pilots would catapult our planes down out of the big outlet port in the ships lower hull drop like stones to the point of visibility and then cruise our beats climbing again to land gently on the great top deck of the ship
It was in reality dull work
We saw little below with our own eyes but the endless stretch of the tropic forest
But we kept our cameras grinding and the subsequent development and comparison THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS of our films revealed much to the staff that could not have been gathered by haphazard visual obser vation
These films for instance showed at times where new Venus batteries had been expertly camouflaged below the floor of the forest
Twoton inflammite eggs in their new nonmetallic casings worked marvellous changes in the topography at such spots and must have permanently discouraged all nearby invaders
Still we didnt get any too many of the batteries
Suction bombs climbed up toward us all too fre quently from unspotted guns
It became obvious that we could not destroy the enemy from the air without blowing an impossibly large section of Brazil off the map and that the enemy had no in tention of coming up into the air to meet us
There was but one alternative
The ground army would have to close in on them from the sides and probably dig down as it went
The Ring Closes In WAS fortunate enough to be the observer of number of actions when finally the ring began to tighten
The description of one serves for nearly all of them
It opened with the innumerable flashes and con cussions of divisional artillery over sector prob ably five miles wide and ten deep
These flashes were but faintly visible from my extreme height
More vivid was the seething churning flaming forest where the shells fell
Somewhere on the edge of this churning area was our first infantry line
Then the barrage ceased and dived for closer view and better opportunity to cooperate
Like swarm of ants could see our men pene trating painfully and slowly it seemed into the devastated sector
Then at several spots in front and behind the writhing advancing line little clouds of white mist puffed out from openings that bubbled up in the churned area as though made by tiny moles
These clouds expanded
Then they began to move in definitely controlled directions
The invaders must have had some form of magnetic control with which they dragged these enveloping mists around with them
Some enveloped sections of our first line and from my position in the air could see the broken ends of the lines at such spots pivot back into new positions to prevent rolling up of the flanks
Two or three of the groundmist clouds suddenly evaporated uncovering enemy detachments of from to men
One was caught between cross fire of two machinegun companies and wiped out in trice
Another was equipped with fanray ma chines but the invaders quickly abandoned these when they found they were not stopping the new nonmetallic bullets of the Earth forces
One cloud noticed suddenly became motion less great dome of mist about yards in diam eter swaying under the pressure of the gentle breeze as though it were halffilled balloon
And it stayed motionless
spotting plane swooped low over it and zoomed for little radio chat with its battery
An instant later veritable hail of shrapnel tore thrugh the intangible mass but ap parently without affecting it
Then from nearby ridge one of our gas details liberated great billow ing cloud of smudgy vapor that rolled down on it like tidal wave
The vapor flowed around over and even through it but the mistywhite swaying dome still showed
saw shadowy grotesquely masked infantry pick its way down the slope from the ridge and with cautious yet alert decision plunge into the mys terious quivering mist
The wave of smudgy vapor rolled on and moment later the mist also sud denly evaporated in tenous swirling wisps that were carried along by the breeze in the wake of the rolling smoke
Only the infantry detail was there
Of Venusi ans there was no sign except the single figure stretched prone on the ground beside little port able machine of complicated appearance
learned later that this was the machine that controlled the mist by creating what for want of better name we called magnetic field although the force involved was not magnetism despite cer tain manifestations similar to magnetic phenomena
This particular mistcloud was decoy camou flage
The enemy had set his control machine on the ground and was about to sneak for safety but the shrapnel blast hit the misty dome bit too soon for him
The accelerated advance of our second line of in fantry ended the engagement
They plunged ahead in open order with supports concentrating on those spots where the line swept through the mistclouds
Curtains obviously cloaking enemy artillery were suddenly rent but not dissipated by pale flashes from within
Others hiding details of enemy in fantry awaited the onsweeping line quietly or moved slowly toward it
It was around in and through these that the heaviest fighting handto hand work swirled and eddied
But the line swept on engulfed the broken frag ments of the first line and in the end slowly surged into the dense forest beyond the area that had been torn up by the barrage while the third line which had now come up sent details of moppersup scour ing through the area of the engagement
Reserves had been rushed forward quickly in the hope that we might penetrate the tunnels from which the invaders had emerged
But in each case it was found that these tunnels had been blasted be hind them by the retiring enemy and had caved in
Innumerable engagements of this nature were fought through this period of the war
The fighting was heavy but the progress of the campaign slow for the enemy occupied vast area about as large as matter of fact as France
In actual number of men per square mile the lines were not nearly as tightly drawn as they were in the old World War but when the increased efficiency range and coordi SCIENCE WONDER STORIES nation of the machinery of warfare was taken into account they were in effect more tightly drawn than they were in that old crude struggle and there was far more finesse in strategy and tactics dis played by both sides
The Mobilization of Science GO cleverly were the strategic phases of the cam paign planned and carried out that it was long time before we ourselves sensed that the idea of our high command was to drive two wedges into oppo site sides of the area occupied by the unearthly enemy until they finally met and separated them in to two areas with the hope that in the process these wedges would pierce or bring us within close striking distance of one or more of the enemys main bases
Whether he had few or many we did not know
No system of espionage could penetrate very far into the lines of an enemy who had noth ing in common with us of Earth except superficial physical resemblance
No man of Venus could be tempted to betray his species by any offers Earth men could make
Few prisoners could be made to talk and those who did had little of value to tell of the plans or dispositions of their own forces
Most of them committed suicide almost immedi ately on being taken
During this period all the scientific resources of Earth were mobilized in grim determination to find methods of checkmating the peculiar sciences and stra tegies of the invaders from space
Vast areas back of our lines had to be carefully guarded for the enemy boring machines could burrow deep under the surface of the ground with relative rapidity and the rear of no fighting division was ever safe
Time and again the enemy surged up out of the ground far in our rear in locally overwhelming numbers taking terrific toll before entire divisions could be pivoted and reserves brought up to enclose them and choke them back into their tunnels
We knew they had to have air ventilating systems in their tunnels and underground communities
The weather bureaus of the whole world furnished their experts to study air currents over the enemy area
Spectroscopic ultrared and ultraviolet telescopes were developed in the hope that long range chemical analyses of the air might betray the proximity of ventilating out lets or intakes
Electromagnetic instruments of the utmost sensitiv ity were invented in the hope of detecting the presence of machinery underground
Penetrative rocketbombs were developed great projectiles to be dropped from aircraft which after falling safe distance would automatically develop their rocket power and plunge earthward with acceler ation and momentum many times that of gravity to penetrate far into the ground before they exploded
To see one of these shells hit the ground was sight indeed
It would throw up an earthspout from to feet high
Then after terrible pause would come an aweinspiring muffled rumbling roar and the surface of the ground for quarter to half mile in every direction would heave and surge and settle down again with trees frequently still standing but crazily tilted and askew The concussion underground must have been deadly to any living beings in tunnels within great distance of the explosion
High enough in the air we did not mind
But when we dived too close to the surface the effect was deadening to the senses
At first many of our aviators met death through loss of control over them selves and their machines due to the concussion
But of all the locating devices we used the micro phonic types proved the most practical of all
Of these there were two kinds audio and radio
It was the former that had by far the more general value
It was simple in principle
thin shaft would be sunk in the ground to depth of SO feet or more and into this would be lowered multiple microphone de vice each microphone element being carefully sound insulated from its fellows and directionally pointed and each having its amplifying units
Operators listened at audio receivers for sounds identified as mechanical And readers developed marvelous facility in inter preting the composite and individual graphs that the light needles made on sensitized paper as permanent records
The radio finders were not of course really micro phones but rather highly sensitive and carefully shielded radio receivers of specialized type which were grounded to the air above thus reversing the usual procedure
They picked up the ground waves of static given off by enemy machinery of an electrical nature
Little by little our scientists learned to detect with fair accuracy the presence of the enemy underfoot within distance of mile or more according to the nature of the surface and the subsoil and for the most part this proved sufficient to prevent their mining under our positions without detection
The success of these finders in turn was probably responsible for their last desperate move in turning loose the volcanic forces which had proved their un doing on their own planet and were fated to bring about their downfall again on ours
Finding they could no longer burrow under our cor don without discovery and subsequent annihilation from our ground penetrating rockets they took the chance of tampering with the internal heat of strange planet
The first we knew of the cataclysmic forces to be let loose was when the upper Amazon river suddenly dwindled and dried
It had been diverted from its course quite obviously somewhere within the enemy territory
It was only matter of hours before our air scouts found the place where great chasm had been opened across the river bed into which the waters were roaring and tumbling
But that was all the good it did us
Dropping penetrative bombs to kill any of the enemy who might be hidden under ground in the neighbor hood did not interrupt the waterfall that tumbled into the depths of the earth
Nor were all the explosives we could pour into the chasm sufficient to cave it in or close it up
Vast masses of earth were blasted loose THE ONSLAUGHT FROM VENUS within and around the great hole but the water washed it down before it had chance to clog them up
CHAPTER VII Cataclysm THINK our scientists had pretty good idea of what was to come for the high command suddenly got very busy
There was hasty shifting of divisions and even army corps without any reason then apparent
Certain geological areas were has tily evacuated
In some of them the troop movements were incom pleted when the cataclysm occurred
Hundreds of square miles of the earth suddenly heaved and boil ed at the outcroppings of certain strata and there began to flow down the valleys and ravines and along the river beds viscous streams of flaming smoking allconsuming lava
number of regi ments and one whole division were cut off maroon ed by the flaming flood that finally consumed them
Our line generally was thrown into confusion by its drastic readjustments and the effect on morale was far from good
The troops were keyed up to fight it out desperately with the interplanetary invaders
But how could they fight such vast forces of nature
In this moment of confusion the invaders who either by intention or accident had released forces that threatened to be more destructive to themselves than to us suddenly launched their great attack or migratory onslaught westward toward the slopes of the Andes which were well back of our advanced lines on that side
They had to break through or perish by the forces they had themselves conjured up
The deploying of our defense was far from smooth in view of the prevailing chaos and so sudden was the attack that there was no time to shift many divisions from the East to the West front
Up into the jungle out of their countless under ground burrows came the enemy hordes in their hel meted suits their great machines clanging grinding plowing blasting and slicing paths through the heavy vegetation for them
They abandoned the niceties of military tactics and came on en masse
The pale flashes of their suction guns faintly illum inated the jungles endlessly in all directions and gar gantuan inferno of shrieking and exploding shells tore air forest and ground to pieces in front of them as they plowed onward
Our first line went down before them as childs tiny sand fort is engulfed by the tide
It had no time to retire
Our second line evacuated its positions to depth of several miles while our air forces and ground artillerly cut into the game with terrific counter barrage
So heavy was the air fire that and my companion scouts were ordered into the mother ship for fear we might be annihilated by the rain of shells from above
Far far to the East could see the pall of lava smoke
Below in every direction the surface of the earth actually was obliterated by noxious haze shot through by the pale and flaming flashes of the Venus and the Earth artillery
Together with the other plane pilots stood in the ob servation room of the great dirigible
But our roles Of spectators were to be interrupted
Col Benner came in hurriedly
To your planes he snapped
Heres where we do diveout and get into it Umbrella ships reported below General plane mobilization ordered fifteen miles East foot level Were going to ride the tail of the whole enemy army and strafe out of em Theyre in the open now where their barrage has sliced down the jungle
Lets go One after another we nosedived out of the keel of the big ship and streaked Eastward in loose string climbing as we went
Morq than planes or six full divisions mobil ized at the rendezvous
As far as could see aloft and below the air was filled with the droning bugs circling by flights thirty planes to flight regiment above regiment ten flights to regiment brigade over brigade four regiments each and division beside division of three brigades each
For twenty minutes we circled perfecting forma tions and waiting for the late comers from the Eastern front
Then from mere fly speck in the distance position that must have been roughly over the rear of the enemy flashed the general orders on which every one of the pilots tuned in
Regiment by regiment nosed down dived for speed and streaked down and away in continuously flattening formations until viewed in perspective from where circled they seemed like vast sheet of immense length and width but no thickness skimming away from me through the hazy air
Then came our turn
Down we went the roar and hum of motors and wings swelling into shrieking whining crescendo
For while it was all could do to hold formation but as my senses automatically re acted from the effects of the heavy acceleration and my nerves tensed to sharper coordination
began to scan the haze below and ahead
Far to the right and below came the flash of suc tion bomb
It must have been feet below our level but from the corner of my eye saw an entire flight sucked down into the vacuum the planes strug gling crazily for control
There were blinding flashes from below and ahead now too and other bugs individually and in groups were sucked down out of formation
Destruction of the Umbrella Ships LL this time we were slanting down at an angle with ever accelerating speed
The contours of the ground took on definite form then the rolling masses of jungle and the churned surface of the earth far ahead
Finally the masses of greyuniformed helmeted invaders became distinguishable struggling writhing forward in massed groups and columns
Somewhere ahead our first line contacted with the umbrella ships
Regimentzooming it rose while Continued on page The bases of the cylinders went through the floor of the cavern
Their spinning move ment created terrific suction for the air in the cavern was swirling
Attached to the cylinders were hundreds of small tubes that gave off deep green ray
THE RADIUM POOL What Has AMES DOWELL reporter for the Los Angeles Outstander is sent to accompany Professor Bloch who is going into Death Valley to study strange human remains found there
In the desert they rescue an old man who tells them strange story
With his partner Driftin Sands he had gone into the Manalava Plain one of the hottest parts of the Valley to search for Allie Lane the sweetheart of Sands who has been missing for forty years
On the way Sands insists that he sees in the desert ahead of them Allie and her father with their wagon
They follow the mirage and finally reach crater in the hollow of which is pool of radium salts
Around the crater is circular cavern from the ceiling of which is suspended the skeletons of two men
Sands in falling down near the pool immerses his fingers in it Gone Before and on withdrawing finds only the stump remains
But his ea seem to be rubbed away and he becomes young man again
Meanwhile they witness strange sight
Out of the cave comes great sphere which revolves over the pool and finally disappears in it
They go into the cave hoping to find Allie Lane there and the wall of the opening mysteriously blocked up
They find themselves lost and are suddenly surrounded by strange sevenfoot beings with faces like frogs
They have tentacles above their heads and by these establish telepathic com munication with the two visitors
shot is fired at one of the beings but from his forehead greenish fluid runs out and the wound closes up without damage to
They close in on the two men and pick them up
OTH Sands and were carried on the broad chests of the mysterious creatures far into the cavern
They made several abrupt descents and the oppressive air told me that we were far below the surface of the Manalava Plain
Their movements were rapid and forceful and their long skinny legs bore their weight re markably well although they wab bled like strutting geese
During the entire course the tunnel was brilliant with changing colors of various hues from green to red and vermilion everchanging
As lay cradled in the tentacle like arms of the big brute who car ried me smelled his evil breath
The odor was the same nauseating smell that had curled our nostrils and threatened to explode our lungs on several occasions since we en tered the cavern
With each slow blink of his eyelids there was an accompanying metallic click
Occa sionally he opened his toadlike mouth and when he closed it hard bony lips snapped like the spring of trap
Sands was being borne along by broad backed creature in front of me
could see his head bobbing with each wobbly step of the beast and knew that he was unconscious
felt worried about Sands
The grip of the big fellows arm around his throat could have broken the spine of an ox without any effort
cursed the brutes venomously
The fellow bearing me tightened his grip around my chest and was forced to gasp for breath
When became quiet he loosened his hold
felt searing welt rise across my body
Presently we were carried into great circular chamber far below the surface of the Manalava Plain
The chamber was luminous with the strange pale green color
In the center spun huge glowing sphere and it was sur rounded by smaller spheres each spinning in an atmosphere of its own like the earth with its suns and moons revolving around it
The huge ball in the center seemed to float in air Ed Earl Repp without any visible support
The smaller spheres likewise spun in midair at perhaps fortyfive degree angle from the large one
They emitted highpitched whine as they spun
My eyes now accustomed to the luminous glow searched every corner of the chamber
To the right standing on flat rock plat form were three massive chairs of green metal that was studded with precious stones
The chairs were vacant Lined around the circular cham ber were several hundred more of the grotesque creatures who had carried Sands and far into the underground world
They stood motionless as though at attention
From deep in the bowels of the earth came clang ing of bells and each creature in the chamber with the exception of the two who bore Sands and across their chests hung their heads
heard the scraping of rock against rock over to my right and allowed my gaze to wander there
huge circular slab of rock was rolling away from an entrance into the chamber
watched it intently until its removal exposed glittering doorway
had become so engrossed in watching the door that failed to notice that was being carried toward the platform
As was borne nearer to the three chairs observed stand ing in the opening the majestic figure of huge bestial creature bedecked in purple and gold robes of metal that glistened blindingly
The fellow carrying me halted before the platform and placed me on the floor
The tall figure in the doorway moved quickly out of the entrance and walked stifflegged toward the chairs
From his dignity at once accepted him as the king or chief of the ERHAPS it is bit unethical for the editor to wax enthusiastic about any story but we certainly could not help mentally applaud ing when we first read The Radium Pool Not since The Moon Pool has there been such story and the second part which we are presenting to you now is certainly by far the better part of the story
The adventure interest accumulates gradual ly and with neverending vigor the story leaps from adventure to science so when finally one lays the story aside it seems as if an entirely new world had been opened to you world that is as strange as it will be unforgettable

grotesque frogmen
stood erect my gaze following him
He ap peared not to take the slightest interest in me
looked around as he neared what accepted as his throne
Sands was lying still on the broad chest of the brute who had car ried him in
His head hung loosely on his shoulders
Disconso SCIENCE WONDER STORIES lately my gaze again returned to the majestic hg ure on the throne
He sat stiffly the tubes above his eyes waving slowly
While my interest was centered on Sands lifeless body two other beings had followed the High Chief onto the throne and sat in the chairs on either side of him
To my uttermost surprise beheld two human beings sitting beside the High Chief one on either side
And one was young woman gayly adorned in brilliant robes of purple and gold
Her wealth of golden brown hair shimmered in the pale green light of the chamber
Her eyes were motionless and she looked out over the room like one in trance
Her finely cut features and appealing blue eyes caused my pulse to beat more rapidly than ever before in all my life
My whole body tingled with exaltation
had an impression that her features bore distinct resemblance to some beau tiful face that had seen before
She stared straight ahead with unblinking eyes
was unable to re move my eyes from her
Where had seen that fascinating clearcut face
Whose features were they
Ah had it
Instantly decided to look again at the photo graph Sands had found in the old album back at the spring
Perhaps it was the photograph that had given me the impression of having at some past time beheld the gentle features of the girl
walked unmolested over to Sands limp form and reached inside his vest
He was beginning to show signs of life when brought forth the well preserved photograph that he said was the picture of Allie Lane for whom we had been searching
Every owlish eye in that great assembly of un earthly beings was riveted on me as strode pho tograph in hand toward the platform
The digni fied leader sat motionless on the throne and re garded me through saucerlike orbs
felt even though no sounds issued from his mouth that he was conversing steadily with pur capturers
The tubes just above his broad forehead waved in all directions as though catching thought waves being broadcast by the others in the chamber
The girl sat in stony immobility
The man on the other side of the High Chief was likewise mo tionless his eyes staring straight ahead
The man was slightly wrinkled around the mouth though he looked to be no older than thirty
His jet black hair which had been freshly combed glistened as from oil
Was this man Alfred Forsythe Lane father of the beautiful girl whose trail led us to the edge of the radium pool
Hardly thought
At the edge of the platform halted photograph held up before my eyes
For moment was ut terly stunned
The photograph showed the same delicately rounded chin finely shaped lips and radiant blue eyes that marked the beauty of the girl in the chair
stumbled backward few steps in my astonishment
Allie Lane must have shouted at the top of my lungs for heard patter of feet that brought Driftin Sands to my side
looked at him
His face was white even under the luminous green glow that affected him
My God he breathed in amazement
Its Allie With leap Sands jumped to her side on the platform
An Inquisition TNSTANTLY the High Chief raised an arm menacingly and thin shaft of green light shot from the suckerlike tip at the end
Sands placed wearied hand over his eyes small round spot the color of chalk appeared on his brow as he sank to the floor heavily
Allie Lane moved her finely shaped head with its brown hair hanging in thin wisps curled around her temples and stared blankly at her fallen lover
She quivered slightly and raised her dainty white hands to her temples as though striving to bring return of memory
Presently she gave it up with shudder and con tinued to stare straight in front of her
The gaze rested upon me felt and shifted my own un easily helplessly
The grotesque people of the underground had displayed their protective pow ers on several occasions and was aware of what my fate would be if interfered to aid my friend
Whether Sands was dead or merely stunned could not guess but accepted the former readily enough
Expecting momentarily to feel the tingle of radium rays carrying me into oblivion hung my head
stood limply at the edge of the plat form full of sorrow over the turn of affairs
Here was Sands at the end of fortyyear search for his lost sweetheart the only living thing that had kept him alive and there was Allie Lane probably broken in mind and spirit and unable to go to him
Now thought his life was snuffed out while he stood on the very verge of complete happiness
offered prayer to our Maker to reunite them again and let them enjoy the happiness that was theirs by right of nature and heritage
didnt think how strange it was at the time for Allie Lane to be sitting there as fresh in the glory of youth as she was when the photograph had been made of her back in Kansas City forty years ago
only knew that we had found her
looked at Sands
He was lying in heap where he had fallen
No move had been made on the part of the giant tunneldwellers to aid him
Certainly could not
One move and would meet with the same fate
was not ready to die
strained hard to think of some way to help him to learn if he was
My mind was blank and seemed not to function
Some irresistible influence was smothering all thought
It was then realized that was being questioned by the High Chief on the throne
cast quick glance past Allie Lane at him
His antennae tubes were pointed straight toward me
felt the strange power that THE RADIUM POOL seemed to pass from his tubes to my mind
shuddered for it gave me terrific pain at the base of my skulL Nevertheless steeled myself for the ordeal of questioning that knew would follow
peculiar feeling came over me
felt that was gradually rising out of my physical body
It was an incredible sensation
Then my brain grasped vibratory mental question
seemed in trance
You Man of the Earth what brings you into forbidden country The peculiar eerie question gave me faint feeling that some time in the dim past had heard it asked of me through similar process
glanced down at my feet
They were invisible
seemed to hang eyes only suspended in murky haze
Before me on the throne sat the three silent fig ures glowing brightly and tinged with greenish hue
Sands inert body seemed to have vanished
strove to answer my questioner
My lips moved but could hear no words
My brain told me that an answer was taking definite shape but it would not be the answer the monster sought
Forbidden country here in America answer ed him silently
Why you must be crazy At that his saucerlike eyes blinked rapidly
His froglike beak opened and red fiery tongue flicked out of luminous opening that was his throat
The chamber was in stony silence
Only the click of the High Chiefs huge eyelids broke the stillness
You Man of the Earth the words telegraphed to my brain
Dare you jest with me
Do you know that Abaris second in command of Jupiter and the entire Universe have the power and the right to forbid anything or condemn any world His words struck me as inexplicably funny
How silly and absurd thought was this sudden boast of power from such hideous grotesque freak
Had he ever heard of the great armies of the United States that could fly over the Manalava Plain and annihilate his entire band of froglike freaks
Hardly thought
felt my lips curl up in scorn at his vanity
By what right have you to condemn and de stroy asked more controlled
His flat beak opened in froggish attempt to laugh
peculiar cackling sound issued from his cavernous throat
He seemed to be enjoying him self hugely
For lowly creature like yourself Man of the Earth who is doomed you speak strong words
What right have to annihilate you
Why ignor ant one have the right by all the power of the Universe
have the power of civilization ten million years in advance of your aboriginal powers
We your superiors by milleniums could condemn your earth to complete and instantaneous destruc tion should we so desire This lengthy message telegraphed to my stunned brain caused me to wonder what sort of beings these creatures were from where they had come and what was their mission here
Certainly the owleyed freak talked like military lord
began to feel that was the proverbial mouse and the cat was merely playing with me for hist own amusement
The strange power the High Chief had displayed in striking Sands to the floor awed me considerably
Of certainty we men on earth boasted of no such strange weapons that shot pencilthin light rays and killed instantly and silently
Perhaps this giant freak was not boasting after all
In spite of my sudden fears that perhaps this tribe of strange creatures might be able to bring into play powers far superior to our own still felt contempt and scorn for them
To have my partner my friend in years of toil and sorrow suddenly struck down by the beasts when he had found joy was enough to bring out my hatred
The fact that they held captive two human beings like myself one woman under strange influence only piled fuel onto the fires of my fury
What have you done with my friend Abaris Great and Exalted Ruler of the boundless Uni verse sneered contemptuously
Such Great and Glorious Ruler as you must take great pleas ure in striking down an unarmed man smite the hand that harms Man of the Earth his soundless words shot back hostilely
His was not the hand that harms Brave Abaris
His was the hand of love and loyalty with mind of sorrow and grief Abaris Explains AT this juncture shot glance at Allie Lane
fHer profile was beautiful as she turned to ward the grotesque creature sitting majestically at her side
Her eyes looked up into the owlish orbs appealingly
My heart jumped suddenly and felt lump rising in my throat
The High Chief Abaris looked down at her though wide lids
One of his snaky tubelike arms writhed upward and encircled her soft shoulders
His head tubes hung drooped in apparent affection for this beautiful girl for whom Sands had spent the best part of his life in constant search
cursed the huge beast roundly
understood it now
The frightful brute had saved Allie Lane from horrible death and through some process unknown to man he had re tained within her the youth and beauty that was hers when he found her at the edge of the radium pool
He must have jealously guarded that youth
through the passing of the years that had made
Sands her loyal suitor an old and broken man
What was the secret of the strange process
Was it the radioactive qualities of the radium that had retained her youth as well as restore the youth of Driftin Sands
If so then why hadnt gone through the same change
Then remembered that Sands had accidentally dipped his fingers into the radium pool burning off the tips
The radium must then have sent lifegiving qualities surging SCIENCE WONDER STORIES through his veins and restored the worn and frayed nerves and tissue of his body
The same injection but through different process thought must have been applied to the youthful body of Allie Lane
Her father too must necessarily have gone through the same procedure else how could he have been restored to youth
Why had he been permitted to live at all
Surely now his years had passed the century mark
But thought Allie Lane would have been better off had she died at the pool
With such beast as the frogfeatured Abaris constantly in her vision and showering her with his affections ter rible life at best must have been hers
And Abaris must have read Sands thoughts too before he struck the man down
He seemed to take great pride in his possession of the beautiful feminine creature felt and guarded her zealously from pthers
Suddenly my subconscious mind reeled under the pressure of Abaris strange power of mental telepathy
He rolled his great bald head aside and with owlish eyes languidly regarded me
My gaze became fastened on his steadily blinking lids
Their metallic clapclapclapclap as they opened and closed sounded dismally throughout the chamber which was now lighted only with pale green glow
The three figures on the throne deeper green but tinged with brilliant red aurora sat quietly
wondered what had become of Driftin Sands
Abaris grotesque features stood out abruptly and seemed almost as fair as Allie Lane and her father under the mixture of colors that glowed from the green and red hues
His great eyes bored into mine so deeply that felt sudden panic seize me
You ignorant Man of the Earth have seen the power of Jupiter greatest and most powerful planet in the Universe Abaris words booming and un spoken reached my mind
thought it strange that these grotesque beings could converse in my own language and by mental process at that
Yes admitted reluctantly
have seen them
But do you know that one of our American bombing planes could fly over here and blow you and your crowd to hell Abaris froglike features parted in grin
His throat rattled mirthfully
stared at him awed
Hoh hoh hoooah My mind throbbed under the force of his booming mental laugh
Why lowly worm he shot his tubes pointing straight at me If but minded to could destroy your entire world with one little globule of radium What do you mean asked with sudden desire to learn all could concerning these strang ers and their aweinsipiring powers
Just this Abaris said evenly and with sar casm We of Jupiter are so far your superiors that you are but worms in comparison
When your people were still clinging by their tails we of Jupiter had already mastered mathematics
Dur ing the years that followed and developed you to your present state we of Jupiter mastered many sciences one of which brings us to your world now
That is radium
We have mastered radium in all its forms and we are therefore masters of the Universe and all life in it Well said why didnt you destroy us here on earth then if you are so powerful
How did you get here on this earth if your planet is Jupiter We Man of the Earth he said amused as though enjoying the mental conversation immense ly and taking great pride in the vast knowledge of his people we do not take life without cause even though that life is no more to us than your reptiles are to you Then why did you kill my friend
queried earnestly
Why have you held these two white people with you Your friend is unhurt physically but mental ly he now belongs to Jupiter
His intentions were doubtful when he leaped up here beside Eloli whom your feeble mind refers to as Allie Lane
should have killed him instantly felt unable to think of anything for mo ment and stared fascinated at the features that confronted me
noticed that the colors in the chamber were changing again and that the lacka daisical visage of Abaris was growing more pro nounced under the varying hues
His saucerlike eyelids continued their resounding clapclapclap like the sound of shutters closing on camera
dont believe you Abaris my voice suddenly raised
You killed him because you knew that he was Allie Lanes man by all the laws of humanity ion this world What care we Jovians for the laws of your humanity Abaris thought wave struck me sharply
could have killed you both instantly
You were trespassing on forbidden ground and therefore had the right to remove you from it How did you know we were here
Our sentinels on the surface informed us of your coming long before you reached here
We had no intention of harming you unless you entered the crater Then thats why you hung up these skeletons out there to scare us away eh inquired
Did you think few grinning skulls would make us run The skeleton of anything on this earth tends to frighten away the living Abaris declared non chalantly
Even dog will run from the bones of its kind why not you who are just step higher intellectually than the dog Youre bragging cuss arent you Abaris shot back with contempt and sarcasm
Youve been misinformed as to the status of the human race on this world
could think up better way to frighten man than that We of Jupiter have many ways to frighten man if you like to call yourself such
But you see THE RADIUM POOL we are not particularly interested in whether we frighten or not
You and your friend and these two humans beside me are the first to have come here since we arrived from Jupiter
We felt no need of methods to frighten others away They Disappear TyTY Lord
thought had these creatures YX come to this world from another planet at time when we on this world were crossing the country in oxdrawn wagon trains
Had they ar rived here before Allie Lane and her father wand ered into the Manalava Plain
Yes Man of the Earth Abaris mental wave reached me in answer to my thoughts
We drop ped down from Jupiter long before your people began crossing your continent
We have been here exactly one hundred of your years and we are now ready to return to Jupiter if that interests you
Our work here is completed
We return soon to our own world four hundred million miles away Four hundred million miles
My mind whirled with staggering figures and gave it up
can understand your mathematical deduc tions Abaris said but just the same Im from Missouri and you have to prove to me that you covered all that space just to visit this world
It is hard to believe
that any living thing can exist long enough to do it
It dont sound possible Thats one of the failings of you Men of the Earth Abaris said evenly
You think that every thing that does not come within your scope of un derstanding is impossible
We of Jupiter long ago achieved immortality
But why should Abaris second in command of the great Jupiter explain to lowly creature such as you the vastly important facts of interplanetary travel You could tell me so might inform my fellows on this earth that it was actually performed
Other wise Ill have to call you liar said with false show of bravado
So far no harm had come to me and Abaris had informed me that Sands suffered no permanent physical injury
could afford to hold up my chin and meet on equal terms with the grotesque frogmen of Jupiter
What were they anyhow but unreal mechanical freaks
Well to tell the truth your world will never learn the secret from Jovian Man of the Earth Abaris thought vibrations seemed to say
might say that some day your scientists may evolve medium for interplanetary travel and we of Jupiter do not intend to shorten the period of time when you will eventually try to visit us
You will not be welcome Youre giving us lot more credit than you have been saying was due us Abaris remarked with grin
Im glad you have come around to to that
It makes me feel better to know that Im little more intelligent than crawling worm Suddenly the chamber brightened under the brilliance of powerful rays
Small spheres spin ning rapidly and glowing luminously shot restless ly to and fro in the far end of the chamber
At the sound they made instinctively turne to them for several seconds
When my eyes again returned to Abaris and his two human companions they were gone
They had vanished apparently in thin air during the few short seconds my eyes had wan dered around the brilliantly lighted chamber
Save for an inert heap lying on the throne in the same position that had seen Sands when he had fallen the chamber was completely deserted
The spheres continued their back and forth move ment as dashed quickly to Sands side
At the close range discovered that his body was tinged with the same luminous glow that had seen out lining the bodies of Abaris Allie Lane and her father
Sands seemed stunned
He was breathing but his lungs functioned laboriously
Sands cried shaking him by the shoulder
Are you hurt From his lips issued deep groan
swung his inert body around for look at his face
The color of it was deeper green than it had been before
stretched him out flat on his back and rubbed his numbed hands to restore his circulation but it availed me nothing
Then remembered that on my desert prospects always carried square lump of camphor in my pockets to rub on my lips when they became parched from the heat
searched through my pockets for it and was overjoyed when found it
It was soft and spongy
Quickly massaged Sands lips and nostrils
Whether camphor would serve in the place of the more powerful spirits of ammonia did not know but you can imagine my joy when his lids sud denly fluttered and his lips parted
The camphor fumes had actually brought him out of the faint into which the powerful rays from Abaris deadly weapon had thrown him
laughed nervously
Thats it old timer said Snap out of it
The devil said he didnt hurt you
Weve got to get Allie and her father out of here
These freaks are planning to get away from here in hurry taking Allie and her dad with them
Sit still and take it easy for minute Sands sat very still for several minutes his head resting in his hands
squatted on the floor of the platform beside him my eyes scouring every side of the circular chamber
To the right the entrance into the chamber through which had come Allie Lane her father and Abaris stood open
The huge circular rock which must have weighed many tons had not been replaced over the opening
The most conspicuous thing in the entire cham ber was the fairsized globe in the center resting on an axis and revolving rapidly
From the distance could see that it was lined with many crisscross markings and glowed as though contain ing transparent liquid of beautiful emerald color much similar to colored glass globes gener SCIENCE WONDER STORIES all displayed in drug store windows in the city
Occasionally the brilliant spheres that hung spin ning in midair darted suddenly toward the larger globe in the center
When one of the smaller spheres neared it the central ball emitted pecul iar highpitched hum
The globes combined with the darting lights gave me the impression that they must be used by the Jovians for some astro nomical purpose
The big sphere thought must represent the home planet of the grotesque beings
What else could they be used for wondered
But was due to learn much before got out of there
CHAPTER VI Sands Recovers RESENTLY Sands stood erect
He look ed around him for several seconds evi dently to get his bearings
watched him nervously
What had Abaris meant when he said that mentally Sands belonged to Jupiter knew when looked into Sands eyes
Like fath omless abysses his eyes glowed like sulphurous fires
The pupils had grown until they seemed to disappear into the rim entirely
He seemed to be in the same trance that had held Allie Lanes and her fathers eyes staring straight ahead without apparently comprehensive powers
Held in the em brace of the strange hypnotism that had probably forced Allie and her father to do the slightest bid ding of the froglike creatures Sands truly be longed to Jupiter
At once resigned myself to whatever fate might be in store for me for could not hope for any cooperation from Sands
When spoke to him he merely stared blankly although was certain that he understood my words
His lips moved to answer but no words formed in his throat
He seemed to have been stricken dumb
Suddenly began an attempt to converse with him through the strange mental telepathy of the Jovians but try as might re ceived no response
He was doomed man unless Abaris would restore him to his normal self
shook him by the arm
think said to him pointing to the opening from which Abaris had come into the chamber and into which he had doubtless vanished that we had better find Allie Lane and her father if we hope to get out of here alive
You know that shes here and alive dont you Sands To me it appeared that he made an attempt to speak when he heard Allies name mentioned but he merely stared dumbly
At any rate believed he understood what had said
nudged him and he trembled under the touch
If we can get to Allie and her father without these critters knowing it whispered into his ear she might be able to point way out of here
If we can get out Ill strike toward Stovepipe Wells and send telegram to Los Angeles asking for help
Im afraid well need couple of bombing planes from San Pedro to get us out of this mess grabbed him by the arm and hustled him toward the circular shaft leading from the chamber
He came readily enough but when loosened the pressure on his arm he stood there stock still
He seemed to have no will power whatever and his legs moved only because hustled him along
Per haps the grip of the strange influence that held him would soon vanish thought
But for the present he remained in its embrace physically and mentally
As we entered the only open shaft leading out of the chamber highpitched musical note became audible
wondered if our movements had sound ed some mysterious warning
As we continued on into the luminous tunnel that glittered with de posits of priceless gems the musical note rose higher and higher so that it seemed to tax the sense of hearing to its uttermost
Questioningly turned to Sands
One of his trembling hands was chafing his temples with thumb and forefinger
The sound gradually became wail ilke the metallic scream we had heard before entering the cave that led down to the chamber
Suddenly became aware that Sands had broken the influence that had held him
With frenzied scream he leaped aside and away from me
gazed in wonder at the man as he crouched like beast at bay
expected him momentarily to spring at my throat
But he finally recognized me and became controlled when assured him the Jovians were not in sight
His first questions were of Allie Lane
Had he really seen her he wanted to know or had he been suffering from brain fever
Was she really alive as beautiful as ever
assured him that she was
Lord he gasped shuddering
That noise would drive man insane Yes whispered softly But you ought to thank it for bringing you to your senses believ ed the shrill sounds were actually responsible for his recovery
What do you mean he asked blankly
Dont you know that the Big Chief of these freaks bounced you for jumping onto the platform dont remember anything but that Id seen or dreamed Ive seen Allie Lane alive he said dis consolately
Well explained The High Chief who calls himself by the name of Abaris didnt like the idea of you getting familiar with Allie and he knocked you out cold
thought he killed you and he might have at that had he wanted to
thought you were goner Hes got hell of nerve then he exploded his face twitching in terrible rage that under the glow of green made him almost as grotesque as Abaris himself
Ive loved Allie Lane all my life and now that Ive found her nothing but death will stop me from having her We havent found her yet Sands reminded THE RADIUM POOL him softly
Shes somewhere down this tunnel
think we ought to get to her as soon as we can
Those devils are going to leave here
Abarisll probably take Allie with him How do they think they can get away so quick he inquired
dont know that yet said
But well soon find out For perhaps several hundred feet we picked our way hugging the gemstudded walls along the tunnel though which Allie Lane had entered the chamber
Overhead small balls of light flitted occasionally illuminating the entire passageway
We encountered several smaller passageways branching off from the main shaft but we continued along the wider thoroughfare
What had become of the Jovians
wondered as we slowly edged our way along the wall
The only thing that seemed to mark their existence in the great underground maze of tunnel and caverns deep below Death Valley was the persistent highpitched musical notes that smashed into the eardrums with an unending viciousness
The Underground Search TRESENTLY our footsteps led us into an other circular chamber somewhat larger than the one into which Abaris had come
This great room was illuminated by darting lights which ex posed units of rapidly revolving machinery from which emanated the highpitched musical notes
motioned Sands to halt until we studied the appa ratus
In our appraisal of the machinery we saw what appeared to be perhaps half dozen cylindrical tubes that stood upright spinning rapidly
Over each glowed pale green luminosity
The bases of the cylinders went through the hard rock floor of the chamber and their spinning movement creat ed terrific suction for the air in the cavern was swirling
Attached to each of the cylinders were hundreds of small tubes that gave off deep green ray for their entire length
One tube ran from the cylinders to central manifold to which was at tached larger tube that fairly sputtered and glow ed under force similar to but more powerful than great vacuum tube
Audible even above the noise that was created by the rapid whirl of the peculiar machines came the steady rhythmic throb of centrifugal pumps
The throb was the same sound that we had heard while we stood for the first time on the rim over looking the crater containing the radium pool
Lights floated above the spinning machinery
They made little bright spots in the luminous green that formed the drafty atmosphere like lanterns be ing swung rapidly in murky fog
turned to Sands who was standing just behind me staring over my shoulder intently watching the motion of the machinery and the darting lights
Im beginning to believe Abaris now whis pered in his ear
These devils are actually drain ing this world of an unknown radium deposit
All this machinery the spheres and lights must be operated by radium power of intensity that is not possessed in the small quantities that we have found so far Well that might be so pardner Sands placed his lips close to my ear But Im interested in Allie Lane nothing else
Lets find her gave him an assuring nudge and we edged our way along the wall of the circular chamber maintaining safe distance from the whirling ma chinery for it seemed possessed with powerful magnetism
would like to have studied it closer but something seemed to warn me to remain safe distance away from whirling cylinders which spun like electrical generators with the tubes con nected like generating brushes
might be drawn into the whirling things and be sucked to death
was still awed over the sudden disappearance of the Jovians and felt that their absence spelled some sinister disaster to us
momentarily ex pected some of them to appear and seize us
With an effort cast off the feeling and we continued along the chamber wall
Suddenly we came to an exit shaft just high enough to admit Jovian without bending
raised an arm to estimate the height of the ceiling
My fingertips just scraped it
The tunnel was in total darkness and this appeared to be the only exit from the chamber with the exception of the one through which we had entered
We clung hand in hand as we went into it
We had not gone more than dozen steps until we were en veloped in an inky blackness
Certainly thought the Jovians must be aware through their peculiar mental telepathy that we were exploring their secret chambers
Why didnt they swoop down upon us and challenge our progress
Perhaps thought they did not figure it worthwhile believing that we would eventually lose ourselves in the net work of underground vistas tunnels and chambers and die as the result
It was grim outlook for both of us at best but had one thing the assur ance of Abaris himself that the Jovians had no intention of harming us seriously
On the other hand neither would they go out of their way to aid us
That was certain
Eventually we became somewhat accustomed to the inky blackness of the tunnel and we were able to make out the forms of each other
Staring straight ahead discovered what accepted to be small circular hole through which came faint luminosity
We made for it as rapidly as we could although we were extremely cautious and fearful lest we step into one of the bottomless abysses which felt existed in the underground world
We edged our way along the tunnel for per haps quarter of mile before we eventually came to the circular light which we had seen
was not surprised when we found that it was an en SCIENCE WONDER STORIES trance or an exit of another chamber
We ap proached it carefully not knowing what might lie ahead
We had no intention of exposing ourselves to the ire of Abaris could we help it
We wanted to find Allie Lane and her father now that he too was alive
crawled on hands and knees to the tunnel outlet
Sands was on the opposite side of the hole
We peered intently into the chamber which was brilliantly lighted
The white bright ness of the light gave me an impression that it emanated from the sun
It blinded us temporarily
The chamber was decorated gorgeously in pur ple and gold drapes that hung suspended from the rooms walls
Massive metal chairs like the three on the platform back in the first chamber stood in artistic positions
On one side of the wall draped with yellow cloth of metal that glistened like fire in the brilliant light hung great sheet of glasslike material that mirrored other objects in the chamber
Under it stood golden dressing table at which was frail silver bench
Truly thought as surveyed the mirror vanity and bench these objects could be of no use to anyone except beautiful woman
The thought gave birth to another idea
Perhaps this was the room to which Allie Lane had been confined
My eyes wandered to the far end of the cham ber
To my surprise there stood near the wall massive couch that seemed to have been hewn from great emerald block
Its coverings were of soft silken material edged with gold
As stared at the beautiful piece my eyes detected slight move ment of the coverings
looked on the couch awe struck
Reunion THERE before our very eyes and apparently alone lay Allie Lane on the silken covered emerald couch
From underneath her brilliant robes protruded dainty foot and ankle
Her face lay buried in her arms and her body wracked with silent sobs her brown hair shimmering in the glare of the light
looked at Sands across the tunnel outlet
He stared intently at the reclining figure his mouth agape
He allowed hand to run ner vously across his brow as though to gain assurance that his eyes were not playing him false
Then made careful scrutiny of the chamber to make certain that Allie was alone
Sands hissed in low undertones that could not have been heard beyond the few feet that sepa rated us
Theres your chance
Theres Allie Lane on that couch sobbing for you
Go to her partner
Ill stay here and watch Sands looked at me for an instant then taking my hand he squeezed it until my fingers ached
Thanks pard was all he said but his eyes showed what words would fail to tell
Releasing his grip on my hand he stepped softly into the chamber and strode lightly with buoyant step toward the silken couch
lump rose in my throat as watched him moving swiftly toward the girl he had gone through hell to find
Few men would have remained loyal as he to this slip of girl and hunted in every nook of California for more than forty long weary years
It was his great love for her in the first place his beautiful sense of loyalty that had caused me to join him in the last few years of his search
Now he was at her side
Allie his voice softly appealing came to me where squatted silently guarding the chamber
My eyes wandered around the room nothing escaping them
Again came Sands ap pealing call
looked at him as he stood beside the couch arms outstretched
The girl lay per fectly still now and her face remained buried in her arms as though fearful to look up
Slowly her head turned
From where squatted could see her profile as it turned towards Sands tears like pearls streaming down her cheek
expected to see again her sweet features staring mutely blank as they were before me when first beheld her
Suddenly the girl sat upright and turned her face up to Sands
Her eyes widened in amaze ment and fright
watched her closely temporar ily forgetting my own sworn duty to stand guard over the chamber
Would she recognize her lover of forty years ago
wondered if she really would
Or was she still under the spell of some strange Jovian trance
My blood pounded at my temples in those few seconds of uncertainty
could imagine her amazement at seeing Sands but could not comprehend her delay in flying to his embrace if she still loved him
She sat very still staring up into Sands luminous green features with their months growth of beard
Perhaps his radium affliction and his beard had puzzled her thought
That was true
She did not recognize him immedi ately as the result
For long minutes she stared at him through glistening tears
Then with soft cry Allie Lane literally flew into his arms
Sands squeezed her close to him his face buried in her tumbled brown hair
feeling of exultation and of triumph surged through my whole body and slapped my thigh with joy
was immensely happy
But my joy was short lived
always was more or less of crank and my happiness soon fled before cloud of gloom that formed sinister thoughts in my brain
Now that Sands and Allie Lane were together again how were they to escape from the under ground outpost of Jupiter
If we did succeed in finding our way out of the maze of tunnels how did we expect to traverse Death Valley without water
It was impossible
Better had we all re main hidden far below Death Valleys burning sur face than to expose ourselves to the sinister power of Abaris or the terrible fatal heat of the surface
Meanwhile my attention was drawn again to the two lovers as they stood beside the silken couch
Allie nestled close to the broad powerful chest of THE RADIUM POOL her sweetheart and spoke to him in low musical voice
Quickly glanced around the room trying not to listen to them
had already violent feeling of being an intruder on their reunion
Oh Robert her voice tense with both fright and joy
How did you ever find me why did you risk your life to come here in the midst of these terrible creatures
Im so afraid love you AHie Sands whispered affection ately
love you better than life itself
Ive searched for you for many years and would have continued searching until could no longer crawl
At last have found you Allie and shall never leave you again Why Robert she suddenly exclaimed
You havent searched for me for many years
You couldnt have because you are just the same Bob Sands you were when you started to California
Why did you let those terrible whiskers grow
dont like them Allie emitted little musical laugh then continued
You must shave those horrible whiskers off at once Dont you know Allie dear that you have been lost from me for over forty years
Ive forgotten just exactly how many years
Ive been searching so long that Ive lost track of time Sands whis pered softly looking into her expressive eyes
smile played at the corners of her lips
You are fooling Robert she said searching his face for proof of jest
It just couldnt be
Why Robert Id be an old woman now if it were true Id be almost sixty Good Lord gasped to myself as stood guard over the chamber and this secret love tryst between Allie Lane and Driftin Sands
Didnt she know that shes been lost to the world for over forty years
Poor girl
Sands oughtnt to tell her
Then again it might be best for her to know everything
listened intently for now wanted to learn any information that Allie might give to Sands re garding the grotesque Jovians and their plans
The information might aid us materially in finding ways and means of escaping them
CHAPTER VII How to Escape
ttO HE was crying softly Its hard to believe you Robert know that you wouldnt lie to me but it does seem impossible
Why Im just the same as was when you left me back in Kansas City dont seem to have grown older
Let me look at myself please dear Allie walked with faltering steps over to the huge mirror hanging on the wall and stared into it her hands wandering softly over her features
Sands walked to her side and peered into the ra dium reflector
The reflection he witnessed there caused him to leap aside
For the first time he saw his face since the radioactive qualities of the radium had restored his youth
Here he was in reality an old man who had been suddenly returned to youth
And instead of seeing the visage of wrinkled and weatherbeaten old man he beheld the features of Robert Sands as they were when he ar rived in California forty years before
His was surprise beyond description of words
He ran hand over his face incredulously
Taking this opportunity to attract his atten tion whistled softly
He looked up with jerk and patting Allie lightly on the shoulder he came to the entrance of the tunnel where squatted
Allie was staring into the mirror incredulously as though unable to believe that under ordinary cir cumstances she would be in the autumn of life on this earth that the beautiful face in the mirror would long ago have become wrinkled and shrunken
Hadnt we better get Aflies father and try to get out of here Sands asked him
Those devils might show up any minute plum forgot about you pardner he said apologetically
forgot about everything
Have you any idea how were going to get out of here
Maybe Allie knows of some way
Ill ask her
Yes ask her now advised
Its now or never With that he walked back to Allie
At the scraping sound of his boots she turned to him smiling joyously
Allie dear heard him whisper brought friend of mine here
Hes standing guard to warn us if anyone comes
Ive got him in this terrible predicament and want to get him out get you and all of us out of here
You want to go with me back to civilization dont you dear will go anywhere with you Robert she said placing her hands on his chest endearingly
Then dear can you tell me how to lead us out know of only one way to get out of here Robert she whispered but Abaris has guards there constantly
Im afraid we could not get through them
You neednt be afraid of Abaris Bob dear
He has been very kind to me and daddy Humph Sands snorted curtly
He has not been so nice to me
Id like to blast him to hell
He knocked me cold when first saw you Allie out there on the throne You saw me there Robert she asked
And Abaris harmed you when you came near me He did Allie
Knocked me plumb out and nearly killed me The brute she said angrily
Well maybe well find way out of here Robert
Let me call father
Hes in the room next to me
Wait here Sands returned to the tunnel and squatted in the semidarkness beside me
He was breathing hard with excitement and there was twinkle of joy and anticipation that formed crows feet at the SCIENCE WONDER STORIES sides of his eyes
He seemed suddenly very joy ous man and forgetful of the sinister danger that hovered over all of us
What would happen wondered if Abaris suddenly came upon the secret love tryst of Sands and his sweetheart
Would he fly into sudden rage and destroy us with his terrible invisible weapon that shot green pencil thin rays and killed instantly
We sat silently Sands with his thoughts of love and happiness with thoughts of danger and death
Presently we heard sound like the scraping of feet
Sands and shrank close to the tunnels wall in the semidarkness
Our fears fled however when Allie came into the chamber followed by her father
Lane appeared at close range to be man of about forty
His hair was black and his eyes were gray and penetrating
His carriage was that of man in his prime of life full of power and vigor and his eyes flashed as they searched Allies room nervously
Sands got to his feet and walked slowly into the lighted chamber
Lane stopped abruptly and surveyed him with an incredulous stare
Suddenly he stepped swiftly to Sands side their hands met firmly
Id given up all hope of ever seeing you again Bob he said in clear voice that tingled with ex citement
It is indeed pleasure to have you with us again
Im sure Allie is glad Thanks Mr Lane Sands returned
Its been long time but Ive struggled hard for this meet ing
Youve faired well under conditions you and Allie but weve got to get away from these frog faced freaks here
Tell me what you know about way out and well start at once Just like you Bob Lane said admiringly
You always did want to be the first to get started
Lets sit down and talk it over
Im terribly afraid that well find it hard to get out however Ive gone through lot Sands whispered
little more wouldnt amount to much Maybe not Bob Lane interjected with frown
But this is one time when you do not know what you are up against
As much as Id like to get back home to my friends cant see any definite way to escape
But Ill cooperate to the fullest for yours and Allies sake The three of them walked softly to Allies silken couch and sat down Allie close to Sands his arms about her waist
heard faint sound issuing from the tunnel that led from Lanes chamber
held my breath in fear
Was Abaris or some of his Jovians coming upon the scene
My blood pound ed as listened with my hands cupped behind my ears to magnify any sound
No more sounds came and breathed easier
turned again to the three in Allies room
Lane was speaking his voice in muffled tones reached me
Allie explained to me how you came to be here
Bob he was saying so we wont re count it again
These strange people here claim they are from the planet Jupiter and came here solely for the purpose of obtaining great supply of radium
It seems that they have exhausted the supply on their own planet
Through delicate instruments Abaris says their scientists discovered that this earth contained great deposit of the metal
They henceforth set out to get it because life on their planet depends upon it for existence
If Abaris fails it means that perhaps the entire population bf Jupiter will be wiped out unless some other heavenly body is found to contain deposit How the devil did they ever get here Sands asked interestedly
Lanes Story TM coming to that now Bob Lane continued softly
It sounds quite impossible but it is fact that Abaris and his henchmen left Jupiter in great spherical machine similar to some of the spheres that you probably saw on your way in here
This sphere which is capable of interstellar travel propelled by radium process known only to their mechanics is ready at this minute to return to Jupi ter with the greater stock of that metal
For long time they have been pumping radium out of the earth and sending it to Jupiter in small spheres which are controlled and guided by an unknown source of power
Abaris says that the deposit here is about exhausted and the cylinder pumps are bringing up the last drops of radium existing in this earth Abaris expects to halt the pumps very soon and enter the interplanetary sphere for departure to Jupiter
He has said that we were to accompany him to his planet nd being unable to escape Allie and have resigned our selves to whatever fate is in store for us
must admit that Abaris has been very good to us and while we would certainly like to get back to our people hold no animosity against him except of course that his appearance as are all the rest of his kind is horrifying to us
But we have become adapted to the environment yet we must naturally rebel against being spirited away from this glorious world of ours to perhaps be regarded On Jupiter much in the same manner as we have looked upon strange animals here
For sometime have suspected that Abaris in his grotesque way is exceptionally fond of Allie
She has wanted for nothing
Her every wish has been granted but he will not consent to our appear ing before the multitude unless we submit to being placed under strange power
In other words we are forced to undergo hypnotism for reason that have not been able to learn
That is why we did not see you when you stood before the platform in the throne chamber
As Allie told you there is one exit from this underground world and that is guarded constantly either by the Jovians themselves or their grotesque deathdealing mechanical guards in the shape of cactus tree with arms like an octopus
The me chanical Jovians seem to have all the powers of THE RADIUM POOL the creatures themselves lacking only their mental faculties
Unless controlled by living hand they are helpless
These Jovians are really geniuses in all forms
You have seen the series of spheres in the throne room with the large hall in the center
The large sphere is Jupiter in miniature orbit
The small spheres are its moons as good Abaris explained to us
Through these they are able to watch the progress of their radium spheres as they shoot their way toward Jupiter
The large spheres show their passage very plainly
But these explanations of Jovian objects and scientific genius are not getting us to our goal
So let us consider the possibility of escape
have plan that we may be able to use listened intently to the plan of possible action as Lane outlined it to Sands
Allies father ex plained that at certain time the guards at the only avenue of escape would be changed and the mechanical Jovians with their tentaclelike arms controlled by remote central would be put in their places
Lane explained how he had previous ly located the source of control over the mechanical men and was therefore perhaps in the position to disconnect the controlling system and suspend their activity
This sounded like very excellent plan but how thought would it be possible for us to steal near the central control apparatus in our at tempt to disconnect it
Surely the Jovians must maintain constant guard over such delicate and important apparatus
But on the other hand they may not feel need of it in view of the fact that Allie Lane and her father had been with them so long that they accepted them as being harmless
At any rate Sands approved of the plan and it was decided that the attempt to escape would be made at time when Lane was to give low whistle and we would all meet in Allies chamber providing of course that the way was clear
Lane with his forefinger drew an invisible outline show ing the tunnel through which we were to go
Sands watched him closely and absorbed the information
Meanwhile shot rapid glances around the cham ber in its entirety in my part as guard
Several times my heart jumped when heard sounds that softly broke the stillness of the cavern but the sounds failed to bring what expected the gro tesque Jovians
Sands was standing in the center of the room now Allie Lane in his arms
They kissed endear ingly
Allies father paced the floor nervously
Sud denly Lane stopped pacing and faced his daughter and her lover
He opened his lips to say something thought better of it then turned half away
He swung around presently as though he had decided on some question confronting him and spoke softly
Allie his words nervous and tense reached me
You love
Bob dont you dear As well as life father she answered
Sands turned to look at Lane puzzled
Suppose then Lane returned that you marry Bob now
It would be good thing in the face of whatever confronts us would marry him now father Allie said in half whisper that barely caught
But how You forget my dear that was minister back in Kansas City her father smiled
Ive waited long time Allie Sands put in holding Allies shoulder and looking into her eyes lovingly
Then will marry you at once Robert she said her eyes shining with happy tears
Father can perform the ceremony Caught
CCVASCINATED watched the procedure that followed forgetting my duty as guard in whose hands must rest the lives of the happy three
With my eyes and attention on Allie as she whis pered do failed to notice that Abaris had sud denly come to the entrance of the chamber and was standing there silently regarding the trio
Lane was saying now pronounce you man and wife when beheld Abaris towering form as he stood menacingly just inside the room
The tubes of his forehead stuck out rigidly his tentaclelike arms twitching in anger and his owlish eyes opened and closed rapidly
shrank back into the darkness of the tunnel fearful lest be discovered
From my hiding place however could see the entire cham ber
As though struck by some terrific force Sands and Lane at once spun around and faced Abaris
Allie emitted fearful little cry and shrank back against the wall
Abaris tubes were pointed at them menacingly and knew that he was speaking to them in his peculiar mental telepathy
What words flew between them was not able to catch for had learned that could not receive the wave vibrations unless the tubes were pointing directly at me
Suddenly heard Sands words as he angrily informed Abaris that Allie had just become his wife and that it was no mans business what he was doing in the chamber with her
His features twitched with growing anger as he spoke his hands were clenched
You frogface heard him shout Ive search ed for Allie Lane for forty years
Now that have found her and she has become my wife you nor anyone else can take her away from me alive Eloli is the bride of Jupiter Man of the Earth caught the thunderous vibrations from Abaris tubes which now waved spasmodically in all direc tions
His thoughts were so powerful that they carried to me where crouched
Allie Lane is my wife cried Sands hotly
We die before she goes with you to your planet of crazy freaks Yes Abaris Lane put in weakly shaking as one palsied
Allie is this mans wife
You SCIENCE WONDER STORIES cannot take her away from him
If is the law of humanity
Abaris froglike beak opened and then closed with resounding snap
expected him momentar ily to bring into play his terrible invisible ray of death
His skinny tubelike legs held up his bar relshaped body admirably thought as watched him from my hiding place
They seemed like stilts unjointed except at the hips around which was draped narrow breech cloth of goldedged purple
His body glistened oilily and around his bald misshapen head rested thin metal band glowing luminously green
His antennae tubes waved angrily
Eloli goes with Abaris to Jupiter Abaris thundered his vibrations reaching me sharply
shuddered under the force of his powerful thought waves
On Jupiter we have specimens of many planetarial beings
Our scientists would like to study specimens of the aborigines of this planet
Therefore the three of you will accompany me to Jupiter
Eloli comes as the bride of Jove We would die there Abaris Lane parried dejectedly
We of this earth could not adapt our selves to your environment You do not seem to understand Man of the Earth Abaris vibrations said that we of Jupiter have accomplished immortality
There is no death on Jupiter
Will you come voluntarily or shall be forced to resort to other methods From where lay hidden in terror watched Sands face
In his anger his features twisted with fury
could not help him should he attempt to attack the huge Jovian commander who stood be fore him
If only could how gladly would have gone into the chamber
Suddenly heard dismal hooting from some where behind Abaris that gradually grew nearer
watched the opening of the tunnel behind him ex pecting momentarily to see his followers enter the room
Two abreast they came their bodies shining with freshly applied oil their loins covered with shimmering breechcloths
Unlike Abaris they wore no bands around their huge heads
Like soldiers their line broke in the center where Abaris huge body stood like pivot and they singlefiled around the walls of the circular cham ber
shot quick glance at Sands
He stood bellig erently watching
Allie had crept into his arms and buried her head against his bosom
Lane stared down at the floor downcast and utterly de jected
When first beheld Lane was im pressed with his flashing eyes and strong power ful body and had figured upon his cooperation at such dire moment as this
But perhaps thought he realized unlike Sands and myself the utter futility of objecting to the demands of the Jovians
But Sands was of different mettle
Slowly he moved Allie behind him and again faced Abaris
The Jovians lined around the cham ber wall stood apparently at attention
They made no move to interfere
Had Abaris ordered them to remain inactive relying upon his own power of combat to force the three humans into submission
Frogface Sands shouted insultingly at Abaris
You call off your dogs and well settle this right now
Im not afraid of your crazy lights and even if was Id rather die than submit to you Abaris throat cackled with his peculiar laugh
His owlish eyes stared through unblinking lids
Sands approached him with sinister steadiness crouched ready to spring at the bulllike throat of the giant
stared at him fearfully
Here was the end thought as Abaris tilted his huge head to look down upon his insignificant antagonist
glanced around the chamber at the froggish Jov ians
They continued to stand silently at atten tion
CHAPTER VIII
The Struggle SI watched the unfolding the terrible AA scene in the chamber found myself won dering what would do if Sands actually attempted to fight his way through the deathdeal ing rays of the Jovians
My hand accidentally touched my gun butt and for the first time since had used the weapon back in the first tunnel re membered that still possessed it
felt some what heartened at the reassuring touch but how useless it was in fighting the grotesque frogmen from the distant world
Surely it could not kill or disable them for hadnt thumbed slug into the bony features of one of them
That slug would have killed man instantly but the Jovian had no more than croaked as the lead tore through his head
patted the gun affectionately and inspected the cylinder
Reloading snapped it back into its holster with grim determination that would use it
Better had Allie Lane her father and Driftin Sands rest in peace on this earth than in mortal terror forever on Jupiter thought
Suddenly my eyes were brought back to the chamber by curdling scream
Allie had fainted as Sands sprang at the bulllike throat of Abaris upsetting him in the suddenness of his attack
Lane stood petrified Allie lay unmolested and unaided upon the floor
Just inside the chamber near the entrance Sands and Abaris seemed locked in terrible embrace of death
Chest to chest they lay on the floor
Sands on top holding in his powerful hands the thin rubberlike arms of the hideous bestialvisaged ruler of the Jovians
Sands grunted as he strained hard to hold Abaris flexible arms to prevent him from bringing into play the terrible weapon that seemed to be concealed in the suckerlike tips at their ends
It seemed like the conflict of two great forces man and beast in terrible battle for su premacy like good and evil angel and demon
THE RADIUM POOL was thrilled at the great heroism of Sands and my heart swelled with the pride of having his loyal friendship
Slowly edged my way toward the chamber keeping well against the wall for closer view of the struggle
As uneven as it seemed Sands thought was the better of the two phys ically
But how could he hope to win such an unequal combat unarmed and against the terrible green death rays of Abaris
White man and plane tarial beast
No greater contrast could be imag ined
The muscles in Sands neck bulged as he labored to hold the tough flexible arms of Abaris
The Jovians skinny legs unjointed and stiltlike kicked spasmodically poor protection against Sands powerful limbs
From better point of vantage watched the struggle
Which of the two would win the terrible battle of physical forces
Suddenly Abaris gave great heave that cast Sands clear from his barrellike body
But Sands held with bull dog tenacity onto the writhing arms of the Jovian leader struggling vainly to pre vent Abaris from aiming his pencilthin emerald rays of destruction
Once Abaris shot his terrible ray and Jovian near him vanished entirely in puff of acrid smoke
ray struck one of the huge chairs and it crumbled
This combat felt would be more like wrestling match due to the fact that it seemed impossible for Abaris to rise on his stilt like legs
That much in favor of Sands
But what would happen to him if Abaris succeeded in strik ing him with green ray shot with uncontrollable anger
studied Abaris bestial features to see how he was accepting the terrific throttling he was receiv ing
His owlish orbs gleamed flaming red and stared bestially into Sands set features his terrible power of will burning into the mans brain
cast quick glance at Allie
She was just recovering from her faint and her father was at her side
From behind fluttering lids Allie looked at the struggling figures thrashing about on the chamber floor
She groaned softly and hid her face sobbing
Watching them my muscles involuntarily be came tense
My breath came in gasps born of sheer sympathy for Sands and his long lost sweet heart
Slowly very slowly the dominating will power of Abaris overcame the struggling physical force of Sands
Gradually he eased his terrible grip on the Jovians writhing arms and steadily Abaris was bringing their suckerlike tips toward his antag onist
Realizing his waning strength Sands made desperate effort to tear his eyes from the blaz ing relentless orbs of Abaris turning his head to the side
But struggle as he would with all the physical strength at his command he could not check the gradual domination of brainpower and will that was slowly but surely smothering him to submission
Presently Sands muscles relaxed and finally the terrific power of Abaris dominating will swept into the core of his brain overpowering him
cursed softly and hid my face in my hands for second
Sands head dropped to one side his powerful arms hung limply
Blood streamed from his nos trils caused by his tremendous physical efforts
caught glimpse of his eyes as his head fell
They were stark unseeing eyes
His body shuddered convulsively as it slipped inertly to the chamber floor
Abaris was hoisted erect by two of his Jovians his tubes waving victoriously cackling laugh in his throat
Allie Lane screamed and her father stroked her shaking head gently as Abaris strode wobbling like duck toward them
looked at Sands
His breathing was heavy and irregular
Abaris thought had not killed him outright nor had he brought into play his terrible rays
His great mental power alone had completely subdued him
Slowly my hand stole to the butt of my gun
With jerk snapped the weapon out of its holster holding back the hammer with my thumb
In space of several seconds could have hurled five slugs at Allie and her father and the inert form of Sands
The sixth had planned was to crash through my own brain
levelled the
gun at Allies temple exposed through wisp of her soft brown hair but could not find the heart tq release my thumb from the hammer
Suddenly felt wave of great remorse surge deep within me for not send ing half dozen shot into the owlish eyes of Abaris
Why hadn shot him as he lay there on the ground struggling under Sands and clipped the writhing arms from his body
Was actually the kind of coward who would stand by hiding like frightened jackrabbit while the life was being crushed out of my dearest and most loyal friends
Alone TERRIBLE rage filled me
What would my wife think of me back at Balch if she learn ed that had stood idly by like whipped cur and permitted those uncouth freaks to commit wrong against Allie and her lover
How could my chil dren ever live down the cowardice of their father
It was with these thoughts in my maddened brain that suddenly dashed out of the tunnel gun in hand and blocked Abatis passage toward Allie and her father
felt terrible urge to kill to spill the blood or whatever it was that coursed through the veins of the frogfaced beasts
Stop Abaris shouted hysterically
Stop where you are
Ill kill you if you move He stared at me through flaming owlish orbs
His froglike mouth opened and there came from his cavernous throat the mocking cackling laugh
It was maddening his cackling indifference
Sud denly remembering that it was within the power of these strange creatures to render my weapon use less causing it to heat and burn my hand lifted the barrel from my hip and let fly
Swiftly and with the flaming desire to kill pounding at my brain thumbed the hammer of my gun
In row six round green holes appeared just above Abaris SCIENCE WONDER STORIES flaming eyes
He tottered for an instant and then recovered himself
An emerald green liquid poured from the holes and ran down into his owlish eyes
So rapidly were the slugs hurled from my gun that the Jovians did not instantly grasp their sig nificance
Then abruptly the entire chamber seemed alive with thin green rays that played with deadly precision around me
Abaris suddenly ill from the effect of the six slugs passing through his head made weak attempt to lift tentaclelike arm
It was with an effort that he brought it up
made leap at him but was too late
ray shot from the tip of his fiendish arm
felt tingle on my left side just over the heart
The chamber floor seemed to rush up as fell heavily
For several seconds lay there in full command of my faculties but unable to move muscle
My head swam and had feeling that was being hurled through space at terrific speed
Then terrible blackness overcame me and seemed to be falling into yawning abyss
How long lay there do not know
For ages it seemed lay on my back making no attempt to move but staring into an inky blackness overhead
What had caused the chamber to become dark wondered
Were my eyes really open
pinched myself
was not dead after all
listened at tentively for some sound to indicate the presence of someone
heard nothing
The silence was awful
Then wondered if had succeeded in killing Abaris
If so he should be lying at my feet
With an effort wiggled leg in an attempt to feel the floor near it
Perhaps Abaris had crawled away or his men had removed him from the room thought
Then remembered the fu tility of trying to kill Jovian
felt no pain although the blood pounded at my temples and felt terribly weak and nauseated
My left side seemed numb deadened where Abaris ray had struck
Presently as lay in the darkness my ears caught low moaning sound
Increasing in volume the sound soon became highpitched wail like that which we had heard when we beheld the sphere whirling on the column in the center of the radium pool
My ear drums pounded under the force of the shriek and placed my hands over them to shut out the maddening sound
Suddenly the whole earth seemed to tremble
rumble filled the room as though the world were in the tumultuous throes of some great upheaval
With an ominous roar the floor under me shuddered and cracked
lay panicstricken thinking that terrible earthquake had swept over the Valley of Death
Crashing earthslides roared around me as lay helpless
Overhead could see thin streak of light penetrating through fissure that was slowly widening
The chamber was becoming brighter under the glare of light that entered it from the fissure
stood upon my feet and braced myself to keep from falling under the swaying movements of the earth
looked around quickly
The chamber was entirely vacant
Not sign re mained of Abaris his Jovians Allie or any of them
They were gone
At my feet noticed spread ing pool of green liquid
cursed Abaris and his hideous followers roundly
Presently as stood staring down at the liquid that must have poured from the wounds had in flicted upon Abaris heard terrific roar coming from somewhere near
The floor of the chamber rolled like the surface of an angry sea
was dashed against the wall where lay
expected momentarily to see the chamber close up and crush me to death sealing me in living tomb deep be neath the Manalava Plain
There came terrific thunderous crash the im pact of which caused me to rise from the ground and fall again yards away
With the crash came the blinding flash of some terrible explosion
great hissing sound reached my ears and then heard loud earsplitting shriek
looked overhead at the fissure in the earth through which filtered the soul gladdening sun light
caught glimpse of great sphere travelling at terrific speed into the sky
As it sped away the shriek of its passing became less discernible and soon died out altogether
The Jovians had departed for their own planet taking Allie Lane her father and Driftin Sands with them
Gradually the earth roar ceased and with it ceased the earths heaving
stared around me now able to see the entire chamber
Not an object remained in it not fragment of any of the beautiful purple and gold drapes that had decorated the room which had been Allie Lanes
The Jovians had removed every ob ject while lay on the floor apparently dead
Abaris ray could not have struck me squarely or else he had been too feeble and weak as the result of his wounds to do more than stun me temporarily
In my rapid search of the room discovered that the upheaval caused by the departure of the great interplanetary traveler had sealed the tunnel in which had hidden during the conflict between Sands and Abaris
The tunnel through which Abaris had suddenly appeared was likewise closed with massive rocks
As last resort to escape from the underground world began to study the possibility of crawling to the surface of the Manalava Plain through the wide fissure overhead
The opening was too high for me to reach up and obtain enough of handhold to support my weight
spent hours working con stantly piling some of the broken rocks from the tunnels under the fissure
Eventually succeeded in grasping sharp rock protruding from the side of the crevice and hoisted myself up
It was hard that climb to the outer world
Presently after what seemed hours of back breaking labor reached the surface
How good it was to breathe the pure air of Death Valley again
The atmosphere in spite of the terrific heat of the Manalava Plain was sweet and beautiful
My lungs long since taxed with the foul nauseating atmosphere of the tunnels and caverns deep below me pumped madly as breathed in the delightful air of my own world
POOL Vv
THE RADIUM The Manalava Plain as far as could see had strangely become ruffled and strewn with broken rocks
Wide fissures and crevices were visible at every hand and on several occasions as picked my way off the Plain was forced to leap over them or make wide detours in order to pass
After ter rible torture eventually reached the spring in the little hidden canyon
There drank deeply of the water that had previously been pale green in color and was now strangely colorless
looked around the weatherbroken wagons and searched the old trunk that Sands had found before we started to follow the phantom wagon with its two mysterious humans but failed to find anything in which could carry supply of water
After rolling in the spring struck off across the Valley
It was hell friends and would have lain down many times to die but the ever present vision of my wife and youngsters over at Balch constantly beckoned me to continue
So here am and thank you gentle men for saving my life CHAPTER IX Have Doubts HUS ended the strangest and most fascinat ing narrative that had ever heard in my en tire career as newspaperman
sat breath less at the very fearlessness with which the man narrated it and could not help but believe him
It seemed impossible for him to conjure in his imag ination in so short time such weird story
It could not have been done even by the most versatile tellers of fabricated stories
Long before he had finished his narrative night had fallen and with it had come its myriads of bril liant stars glowing overhead
So entranced were Professor Bloch and as he told it that we failed to notice that the shrouds of night were lifting in the east as the sun cast its first vermilion rays into the darkened heavens
Through the night the foreman had continued his tale uninterrupted and when he eventually fin ished mumbling his thanks to us the desert world had suddenly become brilliant with the everchang ing colors of desert dawn
stared intently into the glowing coals of the camp fire fascinated over the strange experiences he had unfolded to us
It was hard very hard to believe that tale but some how it rang true
shuddered at the thought of the grotesque Jovians and their uncanny powers
The Professor remained silent lost in deep thought apparently mulling over the story in his scientific way
glanced at him quickly expect ing to see doubt written plainly on his features
Instead they were more serious than had ever beheld them
The foreman hung his head in stupor of exhaustion
Dowell Professor Bloch suddenly called to me as sat staring into the fire
The abruptness of his voice caused me to jump nervously
Yes Professor answered very glad that the awesome silence which had settled over us after the foreman had finished his narrative had been broken
Im very much awake sir My friend said the Professor seriously you have heard this gentlemans weird story
Tell me plainly just how you have taken it
Do not be afraid to express yourself Well Professor said nervously
It is diffi cult for layman to accept such story without basic facts yet feel that certain portions of it are true
Taking into consideration the fact that as tronomers have just about proven that life exists on certain distant planets it is not difficult to be lieve their assertions that its development there could be much further advanced than our own in scientific achievements
It seems quite natural that any form of life on Jupiter would differ greatly from our own due to atmospheric conditions and environment
As for radium it seems quite possi ble that great quantity of it would contain more qualities than are found in the small amounts of the metal that we have been able to obtain
How ever in my opinion there seems to be but one factor in the narrative that has caused me to doubt certain portion of it Pausing cast quick glance at the minefore man
His head still hung in the stupor of exhaus tion
He appeared to be sleeping soundly in squatting position
looked at Professor Bloch
He was regarding me thoughtfully chin resting on his suntanned fists
Then continued It seems to me Professor said eyeing him that if the Jovians were immortal and could not be killed as this gentleman has related there couldbe no existing skeletal remains
You say that Dr James son has recovered huge skull
This man claims it fits perfectly with the facial characteristics of the Jovians
Under those conditions it is hard to ac cept that part of the narrative due to the fact that this man says that the Jovians cannot be destroyed and yet identifies skull as being in exact conform ity with the cranial structure of the terrestrial beings
How could it be possible to recover the skeletal remains of any creature that is allegedly immortal and therefore immune to death Your scientific observations and opinions my friend Professor Bloch said enthusiastically are great for newspaperman
congratulate you
Your City Editor told me that you were the best hand on the Outstander at scientific matters and believe him
However have gone over the narra tive thoroughly and find in it the very same faults you have mentioned
But actually believe this man told the truth
The green tint which marks his skin was undoubtedly caused by radium
have seen radium affliction several times and its power discolors the human skin permanently when it is exposed to its rays for any length of time
agree with you when you say that radium in large quantities must have more qualities than are known to exist in the small amounts recovered
As for the huge skull which Dr Jamesson re covered
It is my opinion that the Jovians were not SCIENCE WONDER STORIES entirely immortal that is when they are outside of their accustomed atmospheric conditions
It is easy to believe that they achieved immortality on their own planet for we today on this globe are slowly approaching period when longevity will be increased to an astonishing degree
It is my pre diction that we too will some day have achieved immortality to certain degree inasmuch as radium is already known to have removed the cancerous tissues of the human anatomy that cause death
However have reasons to believe that some of the Jovians were destroyed by the peculiar atmos phere of this earth when they arrived here
Nat urally they could not be accustomed to our atmos pheric conditions and results were that only the fittest survived the rigors of an alien planet
We must consider that years must have been consumed before they actually succeeded in locating the un derground source of the radium deposit
Those who were unable to keep up the strenuous pace weighted down by the earths own atmosphere were quite naturally cast aside
Some of them could not survive
Hence the skeletal remains re covered by Dr Jamesson But Professor argued seriously How could they survive the slugs from this gentlemans gun
Such slug as shot from his calibre of gun would kill an elephant instantly That my friend is one of their secrets of im mortality
do not know how they could survive
can merely hazard an opinion
This man nar rated that peculiar green liquid poured from the wounds
am convinced then that radium com pound instead of blood coursed through their veins with power enough to heal even the most gaping wounds instantly
Radium flowing through their anatomies would have the power to banish the leaden slugs even as they entered
The lead like other lesser metals would vanish into invisible atoms under the embrace of radium and would therefore have no more effect upon the Jovians than would pulverized dust
But great heat alien at mospheric conditions or some tremendous violence would actually destroy Jovian if he were not of the most hardy sort
feel certain of that my friend The Professor Makes Promise remained all that day at the camp by the Mesquite Springs
After hurried breakfast we lay down and slept until late afternoon
The heat was terrific and it beat down upon me with deadening effect
slept through it dreaming ter rible dreams
Eventually was awakened by Pro fessor Bloch who had already prepared light lunch
The mineforeman was holding pan of sizzling bacon over tiny fire while the Professor set other victuals on the tail of the buckboard
rubbed my eyes sleepily and tilted my hat forward to keep the burning sun from searing my face
We almost left you Dowell Professor Bloch laughted good naturedly
You were sleeping so sound and dreaming so pleasantly that hated to disturb you but our friend here thought it best to take you along Id just as soon die from the heat there guess as melt completely here
Lets eat
want to get back to Los Angeles
The City Editor is reserving room for me in the icehouse Very well were starting now Immediately after lunch we started across the Valley toward the mysterious red streak of table land that marked the Manalava Plain
For hours we rode in the bouncing buckboard for hours it seemed we walked along side of it to relieve the laboring animals
The sun beat down with terrific intensity and the heat waves danced blindingly from the sand
Eventually we found it necessary to continue on foot leaving the burros and the buckboard in lit tle partly sheltered arroyo
About noon we ar rived at what the foreman claimed to be the spot where he and Sands had located the radium pool
The surface of the Manalava Plain was jumble of broken rocks and maze of wide crevices
We stared at deep craterlike depression before us but it was void of anything in the form of liquid
Nothing but boulders lay in its basin and the sides had crumbled in steep loose rockslides
For what seemed ages we searched around the surface for some opening that might lead us down into the deserted tunnels and chambers of the Jovians
None could be found
Evidence of some great recent upheaval was everywhere and search as we did we could locate no avenue by which we might enter the strange underground world
Presently Professor Bloch decided that the un derground domain had been destroyed completely by the upheaval caused no doubt by the tremend ous force of the radium in propelling the space traveler from this earth
Disconsolately we trailed back to the buckboard
When we eventually returned to Los Angeles Professor Bloch refused to make public statement regarding the foremans strange experiences and was henceforth unable to submit the narrative for publication in the Outstander
did however write an account of Dr Jamessons discovery of the peculiar skull and hinted indirectly at its re mote connection with the chain of evolution on this globe and the possibility of this world being in vaded at some future period by Martians Jovians or Venerians but the Outstander published only few garbled paragraphs that were unintelligible and valueless
And for many months have se cretly withheld the narrative until at last have mustered courage enough to submit it for publica tion to scientific journal
Readers of Science Wonder Stories usually can tell fact from fiction
They know well that many unheard of tales come from the vast jungles of desert wastes and invari ably they are true
One thing Professor Bloch did say was that if money and inventive skill could be obtained an attempt might be made to go to Jupiter to rescue the unfortunate trio
If such thing were to happen will be one of the crew
The End The Problems of Space Flying By CAPTAIN HERMANN NOORDUNG AD ME BERLIN Translated from the German By Francis Currier By Gems back Publications Inc
is quite certain that Captain Noordung preceding articles on Space Flying have proven revolutionary
If the letters from our readers are an indication of what the rest of the scientific world thinks of these articles we feel sure that they will prove prophetic in the years to come
In this concluding installment Captain Noordung proposes some further revolutionary thoughts the most outstanding of which probably is his Giant Floating Mirror perhaps the most frightful weapon ever conceived by man
And it should be noted that as in his Preceding articles the final installment is based upon pure scientific reasoning and there is nothing contained in any of the articles that will not come into actuality sooner or later
As matter of fact all of the instrumentalities so vividly depicted by this gifted and noted German engineer could be constructed today if sufficient amount of money were forthcoming
CHAPTER VIII Continued The Investigation of the Stars ISTANT observation from the spatial station opens the most splendid prospects for as stronomy
In this case also there is the pos sibility of using telescopes of any desired size be side the advantage of having the radiation of the stars reach us unchanged
The blackness of the sky would also help by its contrast the observation of the radiation of stars
Showing how it is possible by use of simple concave mirror to converge the suns rays on an object and so ignite it
This latter circumstance would permit all those observations of the sun which from the earth are possible only at total eclipse by simple exclusion of the suns disk through round black shield
Our entire solar system with all its planets as teroids comets big and little moons etc could be investigated in the minutest details
Even Venus and Mercury the two inferior planets that is nearer to the sun than the earth could be observed just as well as the superior planets those farther away than the earth
From the earth as we have remarked this is not possible because of the phe nomenon of twilight
The surfaces of all the neigh boring heavenly bodies the moon Venus Mars and Mercury could be closely examined so far as they are visible to us and could also be mapped by telephotography
Even the question of the habita tion of the planets might probably be definitely de cided
The most interesting discoveries however would doubtless occur in the realm of the fixed stars
Many an unsolved problem of these extremely dis tant bodies would be explained
Our knowledge of cosmic events would be increased so far that we could with absolute certainty decide about the past and also the future fate of our own solar sys tem and the earth
All these researches would have besides their other significance the greatest importance for the further development of spatial navigation
Once we know exactly the conditions in those realms of space on the heavenly bodies flight into space would no longer be trip into the unknown for much of its peril would be lost
CHAPTER IX Giant Floating Mirror ET the possibilities of an observatory in space are not yet exhausted
From the fact that the sun shines not only in infinite power but also uninterruptedly aside from short chance passages through the shadow of the earth use might be made also for many technical uses on earth
From the spatial station itself the suns rays even on the greatest scale could be artificially directed upon various regions on the surface of the earth by properly constructed giant floating mir rors circling about the earth in free orbits and thus floating above it as proposed by Oberth
According to his suggestion they should consist of separate facets which are so arranged in mov able fashion that from one point by means of elec trical influence they can be given any desired po SCIENCE WONDER STORIES sition with regard to the level of the entire mirror
By proper adjustment of the facets it would then be possible to spread the entire solar energy reflected from the mirror according to needs over wide ex panses of the earths surface to concentrate it on individual points or finally when it is not needed to let it radiate into space
How the giant mirror in space proposed by the author may be used to give perenniai daylight tol the earth
The mirror is on the side of the earth that ia turned away from the sun
The suns rays strike it and are reflected to the earth or any part of it
where the concentration of the rays produces the equivalent of the direct light and heat of the sun
The fact that such spatial mirrors would be weightless because of their motion in orbits would materially simplify their manufacture
According to Oberth circular wire network is to serve as frame being spread out in space for this purpose by rotation
In its meshes the separate facets would be placed consisting of sheet sodium as thin as paper
According to his estimates such mirror with diameter of kilometers would cost about and would require about fifteen years to construct
Besides this there would probably be other pos sibilities of building such giant floating mirror
With smaller diameters of only few hundred meters it would be possible to give the entire mir ror so rigid construction that it could be turned in its entirety about its center of gravity by means of rotary motors and could be given any desired change of position
The electrical energy needed for guiding such mirrors would be amply available in the spatial ob servatory
The guiding apparatus itself would have to be in the observatory proper so arranged that it could be used during simultaneous observa tions through the giant telescope so that it would be possible to direct most exactly the illumination of the mijror on earth
The use of this equipment would be manifold
Important harbors or airports great railroad sta tions even entire cities could be illuminated at night cloud conditions permitting by natural sun light
How much coal could be saved if for ex ample Berlin and the other great cities were illu minated in this manner
The Most Frightful of Weapons HIS mirror like every technical achievement could also be used for the purposes of war fare and what is more it would provide weapon far surpassing in frightfulness everything thus far used
It is common knowledge that very considerable temperatures can be produced by concentrating the suns rays with concave mirror such as with the aid of burning glass
Even if the mirror is no larger than hand it is possible to kindle directly pieces of paper even such things as shavings of wood etc which are held at its focus
If we now assume that the diameter of such mirror is not merely ten centimeters but several hundred or even thousand meters as would be the case with mirror in space then steel would melt and even incombustible materials could hardly re sist permanently if sunlight so tremendously con centrated struck them
And assuming that the observer in space with the aid of his mighty telescope saw spread out be fore him the entire field of battle with the country behind the lines of the enemy with all his routes of approach by land and sea all this like gigantic map showing even the smallest details
Then we can form an idea of what such spatial mirror guided by his hand would mean as weapon NEPTUHS Fig
Showing the sun and the orbits of the suns planets
This in dicates the relative distances of the various planets from the sun
The four minor planets
Earth Mars Venus and Mercury are only frac tion of the distance that the four major planets are from the sun
By using it there would be no difficulty in blow ing up the munition dumps of the enemy setting fire to the depots of his supplies and melting his cannon armored turrets iron bridges the rails of important railways etc
Moving trains factories important for war even entire industrial establishments and great cities could be burned
Troops on the march or in camp would simply be carbonized if the bundle of rays of this concentrated sunlight were passed over PROBLEMS OF SPACE FLYING them
And the ships of the enemy no matter how powerful they were or how strongly fortified the harbors in which they sought refuge could not pos sibly be protected from it
They would be de stroyed burned out as we eliminate vermin from their hiding places with the blast flame
These would be actually the rays of death
Yet they are no other than the lifegiving ones which we daily desire from the sun
In this case how ever we would have little too much of good thing Yet matters would scarcely come to all these hor rors
No power would ever venture to begin war with nation having control over such frightful weapons
CHAPTER To Distant Heavenly Bodies our previous considerations we have not dealt with travels beyond the realm where the attrac tion of the earth is paramount
How are mat ters with regard to the real purpose of the journey in space the complete separation from the earth and the reaching of distant heavenly bodies
First let us briefly view the stellar universe as it will be viewed from the standpoint of spatial navigation as future realms to travel
We must therefore change and enlarge our mental out look
For if we wish to regard the entire cosmos as our world then what has hitherto seemed to us to be our world the earth will be our home in the narrowest sense
Not the earth alone
All else that is bound to it by its gravity such as the future station in space and even the moon must also be reckoned as part of our narrow home in the uni verse as belonging to the realm of the earth
After all how small the distance from the earth to the moon is some kilometers compared with the other distances in space
It is only hundredth of the distance of our nearest planets Venus and Mars
And the sphere that would be made by the moons orbit around the earth could easily find room inside the sun
The first unit in space to consider beyond our earth is the solar system with all the various planets belonging to it
There are eight principal planets of which our earth is one together with numerous other heavenly bodies
Most of the lat ter the asteroids periodic comets meteors etc are of small size
Of the planets Mercury is nearest the sun then follow Venus the earth
Mars Jupi ter Saturn Uranus and finally Neptune
Accord ingly Venus and Mars along with the moon are the direct neighbors of the earth
All these heavenly bodies are permanently bound to the sun by the power of mass attraction and compelled constantly to revolve about it as cen tre in elliptical paths
They form the realm of the fixed star the sun Illuminated and warmed by the splendor of its rays and also controlled by the stead fast might of its gravitational pull they are joined in eternal union an island in the emptiness and darkness of space
Such is our greater home in the universe the solar system
This is realm indeed of tremendous size even light though it hurries through space at the speed of kilo meters second takes more than eight hours to cross it directly
Yet how tiny is this world as compared with the incomprehensible extent of the universe from which many heavenly bodies the fixed stars heated even to gaseous state send us the greeting of their shining rays
Even the nearest of them Alpha Cen tauri is lightyears away that is about times as far as the diameter of the whole solar system
All the others however are much farther from us most of them hundreds and thousands of light years
And if there were already extinguished fixed stars nearer us in the eternal darkness of empty space we could never see them
From this it is already apparent that as for trav elling to distant heavenly bodies we can now take into account only those belonging to the solar sys tem
The Technique of Travelling HE manner in which distant travel through space would have to take place would in gen eral be in free orbits about those heavenly bodies in whose paramount fields of attraction the trip takes place
Within the realm of the sun there MARS Fig Showing the sun and the orbits of the four minor planeft
Mercury Venus Earth and Mars
This indicates also the relative dis tances of the orbits from each other fore we must move around the latter always in some sort of free orbit if we are not to become subject to its gravity and plunge into its sea of fire
Certainly we need not pay special heed to this point as long as we remain in the narrower realm of the earth or of some other world in the solar sys tem
For each of thdse revolves about the sun in its own free orbit so to speak and with it at the same time and because of it all the bodies belong ing to it
With the earth whose speed is SCIENCE WONDER STORIES meters second there also revolves the moon at present and there would revolve our future station in space the moon and the station being both satel lites of the earth
All of these bodies going around the sun its attraction thereby loses its direct effect iveness on them
This is called the stable condi tion of floating as regards the sun
Only when the space ship passes out of the nar rower region of attraction of one of the heavenly bodies revolving around the sun would it have to travel around the sun in free orbit of its own
For example if it is question of trip from the earth to distant planet then on the basis of what has been said not only the course of this indepen dent path but also the time of departure from the earth must be so chosen that the space ship arrives at point in the orbit of the planet to be visited at approxinuitely the same time as the point is passed by the planet itself
Showing the effect on body rotating about the aun of change in its velocity
If the speed of the body such as the earth ia accelerated it will withdraw from the sun to new orbit
If the speed is retarded it will approach to form new orbit
If the ship is thus brought into the region of at traction by the planet to be visited then the possi bility is open of either circling it in free orbit as satellite as often as desired or descending on it
In case the planet has blanket of air like that of the earth the landing can be by method already con sidered for landing on the earth Hohmanns land ing manoeuver by use of decreasing ellipses
If blanket of air such as the earth possesses is miss ing then the landing can be effected only by recoil braking making the force that operates the ship work in the opposite direction to the direction of fall during the descent
In order to journey within the solar system to another heavenly body after successfully getting free from one it would be necessary to change the orbital motion which we would have previously acquired around the sun along with the original planet by the assistance of the propelling force
Thereby we would enter an independent orbit about the sun this serving as an intermediary orbit to join the orbit of our own planet with that of the other
According to the laws of celestial mechanics for this purpose the original orbital motion must be altered according to the location of the goal that is it must be accelerated if the ship is to go away from the sun and retarded if it is to approach the sun
Finally as soon as the desired heavenly body is reached the independent motion of the con necting orbital path must be changed to that which the ship must take in relation to the new planet in order to carry out the manoeuver of cir cling about it or of landing
The return trip would have to take place in the same way
It is accordingly clear that in the course of such distant trip through planetary space repeated changes in the condition of motion are necessary
These must each time be effected by propulsion with artificial power and therefore require the ex penditure of fuel
This expenditure according to Hohmanns calculations is least when the orbits of the original planet and that to be visited are not cut by the connecting orbital path of the ship but are merely touched by it
In any event the nec essary amounts of fuel are considerable
Still greater amounts must be added if the planet to be visited is not to be circled about but actually landed upon directly
The amount of fuel needed in fact increases with the mass of the planet and accordingly with its power of attraction
This is understood when it is considered that ascending again from it in starting the return trip requires very considerable expenditure of energy as is al ready known from such an ascent from the earth
If furthermore the braking on landing must be done by means of the propulsion recoil braking in the absence of suitable atmosphere then there results further tremendous increase in the neces sary fuel
Moreover this fuel must all be taken along on the trip from the earth at least on the first visit to remote planet for we could not count beforehand on being able to secure there the fuel needed for the return trip
CHAPTER XI The Start from the Surface of the Earth commence such trip directly from the surface of the earth and to overcome its gravity it would be necessary to also lift this whole supply of fuel
According to previous re marks this of itself demands most extraordinary expenditure of work
In the case at hand at least with the efficiency of fuels now available the amount necessary to be taken along would accordingly make up so great part of the total weight of the ship that its con struction would be hardly possible
The only visit to heavenly body which could be undertaken directly from the earths surface by means of fuels known now would be the circum navigation of the moon for the purpose of closer observation of the nature of its surface especially on the side of it always turned away from the earth
In the course of this we could be imprisoned by the moon to circle about it as often as desired in In other words if the ship moves tangentially to the orbit of the planet it leaves and takes path that brings it tangent to the orbit of the new planet the energy required would be minimum
Editor PROBLEMS OF SPACE FLYING free orbit like satellite of the moon
The amount of fuel needed for this undertaking would not be much greater than for normal ascent from the earth to the practical limit of gravity
The Spatial Station as Basis for Spatial Travel HE conditions would be considerably more fa vorable however if as Oberth proposes fuel depot were constructed floating at proper height above the earth and constantly circling about it in free orbit to serve as starting point for the trip instead of the earth
In this case only slight expenditure of work would be needed to be entirely free from the earth and the ship would ac cordingly not need to be loaded with the fuel nec cessary for the ascent from the earth
Only little more would need to be taken along than would be required for the distant trip itself
Since the depot as result of its free orbital mo tion would be weightless the fuel could simply be placed there in any amount freely floating at any point in space
If protected against the rays of the sun even oxygen and hydrogen could be kept in definitely in solid state
The supplying of it would have to be managed by constant travelling of space ships back and forth
This might be from the earth or from the moon
In the former case the fuel at least so far as it consists of liquefied oxygen and hydrogen could be produced in great power plants operated by the heat of the tropical ocean
The moon would be an especially advantageous base as Max Valier suggests
There the mass and accordingly the force of attraction are much smaller than those of the earth which would greatly lessen the expenditure of work needed for the as cent and therefore for the carrying of fuel from it
Certainly this presupposes that the necessary raw materials are actually present on the moon that is that there is at least water even in the form of ice
The latter would be electrolytically decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen the required energy be ing provided by solar power plants
Unfortunately the probability of this is not too great
If it should be the case however we could use the moon also as Hohmann suggests for the start ing point of spatial travel and accordingly make the fuel depot on it
In spite of the many advantages of this plan Oberths proposal of freely floating depot seems more favorable because from it the complete re lease from the field of attraction of the terrestrial region including the moon would demand con siderably smaller expenditure of energy
Indeed from the standpoint of economy and energy it would be doubtless most advantageous to establish the depot one or several million kilometers from the earth especially if the fuel has to be transported to it from the earth
We shall nevertheless transfer it to our station in space making the latter thereby the base for the travelling because it is already supplied with all the equipment necessary
An especially important part of the equipment would be the giant telescopes
Thanks to their al most unlimited efficiency they would make it pos sible first to examine minutely from distance the regions to be travelled in the stellar world
Furthermore the space ship could be kept under constant observation during large part of the trip and frequently during the whole of it
By means of light signals shown by the ship at ap pointed times there could be communication at least on one side
Thus the spatial station aside from the many duties already mentioned would be able not only to initiate real travel about the universe but also to serve as an operating base for all spatial journey
The Accessibility of the Neighboring Planets OHMANN has thoroughly investigated the problem of visiting other heavenly bodies
Ac cording to his results expressed in terrestrial chro nology the trip from the earth to Venus would last days and that to Mars
round trip includ ing circumnavigation of both Venus and Mars at the relatively slight distance of about eight million kilometers could be performed in about year and half
For visiting Venus and landing upon it in cluding stay of months together with the trip there and back not quite years would be required
Let us assume that the journey is to commence according to our previous observations from the spatial station so that final release from the field of gravity of the earth would require only little energy
The return takes place directly to the sur face of the earth so that no energy at all need be used for this
One can descend merely with brak ing by air resistance
Let the weight to be trans ported be two persons together with the provisions needed for the entire trip and all the apparatus re quired for observations and other purposes
Hohmann calculates that the space exploring ship ready to start provided with all the fuel necessary for the trip both ways must weigh approximately as follows for the previously mentioned round trip including circumnavigation not landing of Venus and Mars tons per cent of this being fuel for the first landing on the moon tons on Venus tons on Mars tons
In the first of these three cases per cent in the other two about percent of the entire weight of the ship would have to be fuel
The expulsion speed of meters second from the earth is assumed
It is clear that the construction of ship to carry rocket propulsion fuel making up per cent of its entire weight would present such considerable tech nical difficulties that its manufacture could hardly succeed at present
Accordingly only the moon of all the larger heavenly bodies next to us could at present be in question for visit including SCIENCE WONDER STORIES landing
However we could at best approach very near the planets and circumnavigate them without however landing on them
Still we have hope that in the course of time by the aid of the principle of sectional construction we may finally succeed even with the technical means known today in construct ing space rockets which can even execute landings on the neighboring planets
Fig Showing two ways that body can travel from one planet to another
The first way shown on the left which is the easier the body leaves the planet on tangent to its orbital path and travels sqi that it approaches the orbit of the next planet on tangent to its path
The smallest amount of power is required for this
By the second method shown on the right the body is forced to cross the orbit of one planet to get to the other
This would be necessary if the calculation as to the path to take in space has been badly done
This method takes greater amount of power than the first for the body is forced to travel further away from the sun and therefore overcome for greater distance the suns gravitational pull
Doubtless this exhausts all the possibilities which seem to be offered to spatial navigation in the pres ent state of science
For the difficulties would be far greater which confront visit to more distant planets of the solar system
It is not merely that the routes to be travelled are far longer than those hitherto considered
Since all these planets are at greatly different distances from the sun than the earth in reaching them the field of gravity of the sun plays considerable part
This attraction would have to be overcome by energy
If for ex ample we travel away from the sun ascend from it we must overcome its pull exactly in the same manner as when we travel away from the earth
This is shown in the previously mentioned change in orbital speed about the sun necessary in distant travel through planetary space
But if we wished to descend on one of these planets tremendous amounts of fuel would prove necessary especially in the case of Jupiter and Saturn
These in consequence of their enormous masses possess very powerful fields of gravity
As for reaching the fixed stars their extreme re moteness alone makes them impossible of consider ation
Distant Worlds HIS does not affirm that we must for all time remain confined only to the region of the earth and the neighboring planets
If we succeed in in creasing the repulsion speed in recoil action beyond the amount of or perhaps meters second thus far reckoned the highest practically at tainable or if we find possibility of storing very great amounts of energy in small space then the situation would be entirely different
And why should not the chemists of the future develop propelling material far surpassing in ef fect those already known
It is even conceivable that in time we shall succeed in making technically serviceable and in using to propel space ships those tremendous amounts of energy confined in matter energy whose existence we already know
Perhaps we shall also find method of using for this purpose the electrical phenomenon of cathode radiation or by some other way to attain tremen dous increase in repulsion speed through electrical influence
There might lastly come into question suitable use of the suns radiation or of radium decomposition etc
Certainly natural possibilities for future investi gators and inventors are still plentifully available in this respect
If success should result then we could visit and actually set foot on many of those faroff worlds which as yet we only view at im measurable distances in the starry heavens
An ancient dream of mankind
Would its ful fillment be of any use to us
Certainly science would make extraordinary gains
No certain judg ment is possible today regarding the practical value
How little we know of even our nearest neighbors among the heavenly bodies
The moon still part of the region of the earth our narrower home in the universe is of all the distant heavenly bodies the one best known to us
It is cold has no covering of air and is without any higher form of life
It is gigantic mass of rock floating in space fissured inhospitable rigid in death world of the past
But we have considerably less knowledge regard ing the body next best known to the moon our neighboring planet Mars
But in comparison with our knowledge of other planets our knowledge of Mars is considerable
Mars too is an aged world though not nearly so old as the moon
Its mass and therefore its force of attraction are both much less than those of the earth
It has indeed covering of air yet of far less density than that of the earth
On its surface the air pressure is certainly considerably lower than even on our highest mountain tops
Apparently it possesses water
fairly large part of this may be frozen its mean temperature seems to be much below that of the earth even if in places as on the Martian equatorial belt comparatively high tem peratures have been determined
Because of the thinness of the atmosphere the differences in tem perature in the day and at night are very great
The strangest and most discussed of all Martian observations in the phenomenon of the socalled Martian canals Even though recently they are often regarded as merely optical illusions we really know nothing about them
PROBLEMS OF SPACE FLYING At any rate what we already know about Mars does not offer us enough clues to be able to form final judgment as to whether this planet is inhab ited by intelligent creatures or by any creatures at all
It would hardly be habitable for persons from the earth chiefly because of the rarity of its at mosphere
Therefore it would offer spatial navi gation an extremely interesting object of investiga tion from the scientific standpoint
But whether landing there would have practical value as well cannot be recognized today with certainty
It hardly appears likely however
It is another matter with our second neighboring planet Venus splendid shining heavenly body known to us as morning star and evening star Its size its mass and therefore the force of gravity prevailing on its surface are only slightly less than those of the earth
It also has covering of air doubtless very similar to ours though somewhat deeper and denser
Unfortunately Venus is hard to observe from the earth because it always appears near the sun and therefore is only visible at twi light
Accordingly we are still entirely uncertain about its rotation on its axis
If its period is ap proximately that of the earth about twentyfour hours as is widely assumed then Venus and the earth would have marked resemblance
It is therefore with this planet that we may mot reasonably count on finding conditions of life similar to those on earth even if the suspicion that it is always covered with clouds should prove cor rect
Even on the earth there was highly de veloped life of plants and animals at time when part of the water now filling the oceans was still in the form of vapor
Certainly of all the heavenly bodies known to us Venus offers the greatest like lihood of being suited to occupation and thereby of coming into question as future goal of travel
Since it is also the nearest of all the planets it might well be the most enticing object for spatial navigation
Mercury being still nearer the sun offers even less favorable conditions of observation than Venus
It is the smallest of all the planets having cover ing of air which is probably only extremely thin and surface apparently similar to that of the moon
For these reasons and especially because of its closeness to the sun the solar radiation is about nine times as strong as on earth extremely unfa vorable temperature conditions must prevail there
Mercury would accordingly be hardly at all invit ing as place to visit
Although in considering the previously men tioned planets it was possible to arrive at fairly probable result what we so far know is insufficient for the purpose in the case of those more distant Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune
We have indeed been able to determine that they all have dense coverings of air
The question of the nature of the surfaces of these planets is however still entirely uncertain
With Jupiter and Saturn this is because they are so densely enveloped by condensa tion products clouds of some sort or other that we apparently do not see their real surfaces at all
In the cases of Uranus and Neptune it is because their extreme remoteness prevents more exact ob servation
Concerning their value as goals for space travel it is difficult to say anything
Yet merely the cir cumstance that we have determined in the case of these planets relatively low average density from to of that of the earth leads to the con clusion that very different physical condition must exist from that of the earth
This alone must greatly lessen our expectations of visit
Still it would perhaps be possible that some of the satellites of these planets more especially those of Jupiter would offer comparatively more favor able prospects
One thing is absolutely certain the mass and consequent force of the field of gravity of each of these planets being tremendously greater than those of the earth would make visiting them ex acceleraton MIDDLE DECELERATION AS
TOTAL DISTANCE COVERED DIRECTION DEMOTION Fig
speed curve showing the method of acceleration and decel eration in going from point to
The body is uniformly accelerated from rest until it reaches maximum speed halfway between and then it is uniformly decelerated until it comes to rest at traordinarily difficult especially in the case of Jupiter and Saturn
Regarding finally the various other bodies be longing to the solar system it is reasonably certain today that we could hardly derive any special prac tical benefit from visits to them
We see therefore that we may not be too op timistic about the advantages to be expected of other members of the solar system
But thus far we certainly know far too little not to let our thoughts have free rein in these respects
It might well be that all these worlds will prove to be entirely worthless to us
On the other hand perhaps we would find on many of them fertile soil plants and animals possibly of sort entirely odd and strange to us
They might even be of gigantic size like those once existing on the earth
Indeed it is not incredible that we might find even human beings or similar creatures maybe even pos sessing civilizations very different or even older than those of our ative planet
It is even highly probable that life on distant planets in case it exists there is on another level than that of the earth
Then we could experience the marvel of viewing conditions from the evolution SCIENCE WONDER STORIES of our earthly existence conditions of the present time real and living yet pictures of past or future countless millions of years away
Or it might be that we would find valuable sub stances which are very rare on earth such for ex ample as radium occurring in an easily obtainable form
If the conditions of life discovered there were The suitable for permanent occupancy perhaps then incredible as it may sound today distant planets would in the course of time come into question for emigration and colonization
As we have remarked before there is little likeli hood that there are such suitable planets among those of our solar system with the single exception of the planet Venus
The Onslaught from Venus Continued from page the second line dived below them and the third drove head on into the enemy air formation
It seemed as if the entire atmosphere of the world blazed and flamed for split second
The three front lines somewhat shattered readjusted themselves to normal formation
And my own line was driving through acrid smoke as below me fell away the gro tesquely twisted fragments and wreckage of um brella ships and planes
took my hand off my guns
There was nothing to shoot at
There were no um brella ships left
And few seconds later our great sheet of planes swept down low in an undulating dive and drove along strafing the struggling and disordered formation of the enemy
It was kaleidescopic
Our speed was terrific
Twen ty thousand heavy calibre machine guns spat forth an instantaneous blanket of flaming death that pinned down the invaders by untold thousands
Here and there fanray machines raised fluttering futile pale canopies of wouldbe protection
But our shells were not of metal now
Great lumbering masses of machin ery heaved and plunged along on their queer leverlike legs only to tumble ponderously into great shell holes or suddenly shiver and tremble like living things then settle down with weakly waving metal leg or two and die As suddenly as was plunged Into it all found myself out of it
Subconsciously following the line ahead had zoomed and looped my way into the com parative peace of higher level
Automatically my brain registered the signals clicking in my ear phones and found myself streaking for new rendezvous preparatory to second attack
But we never delivered that attack
We were called off
The enemy mob which no longer could be desig nated as an army was plunging frantically against our new ground positions and for miles along that line un yielding regiments of infantry stood off the hordes of an alien planet
The End TTE saw little of what followed
To us there were VV vague hazy scattered movements of large and small detachments of troops and the interminable rip ping and rumbling of barrages
Little more was vis ible from our height
But there is no need for me to tell how the high command finding that our lines actually had checked The the demoniac fury of the Venus lunges and knowing their entire army was in disorder threw all available reserves into the fight even going to the extent of arm ing the girls regiments in the auxiliary services and hurling them into the welter how the divisions of Earth surged forward shooting hacking and thrust ing their way irresistibly through the invaders until to the last man and woman they were beaten and hunted down to that death which they preferred to surrender
For there already exists voluminous history of that particular phase of the struggle
have often wondered at what place and time during this great struggle the Venus girl Nyimeurnior met her end and the old miorurlia who learned English from me
And have often wondered too at that pe culiar lack of sympathy with which my memories and my speculations as to their possible fates are tinged for am not by nature an unsympathetic man
There seems to be no other explanation for it that can find than fundamental planetary antagonism
These people of Venus were intelligent beings much like us of Earth in appearance and in many physical respects
Yet could not feel for them the friendli ness that would feel for dog cat yes even for familiar insect of this earth
am convinced that the civilized nations would have extended them aid and mercy as matter of principle even after we had experienced this peculiar repulsion upon actual contact with them
They would have been given section of the world they could occupy in peace and relative comfort the almost uninhabited jungles in which they tried to establish themselves for in stance had they not blindly insisted on precipitating struggle that could end only with their extermination
But perhaps there is some little understood law of the Universe that was only proving itself in this case
These people of Venus did not belong on Earth
And though they showed superability and superpower in crossing the barriers of space and in maintaining them selves in the midst of conditions physically adverse though they unquestionably had the intelligence to co operate with Earth men well let me suggest it this way perhaps having had the effrontery to transgress successfully some fundamental propriety of the Uni verse it was ordained that they should destroy them selves in that accomplishment
But their vast labor and ultimate desperate terror was in vain
They might have better met their end on Venus dying without struggle or without vain hope

ASTRONOMY METEOROLOGY MOVIES SHOW LUNAR DAWN moving picture film of dawn on the moon was taken recently at the Princeton University Observatory and exhibited
The mechanism for taking the pictures was per fected by Fleming Arnott of Upper Montclair
The pictures were taken at the rate of one every six seconds whereas the usual rate is about to one second
By means of inch telescope the moon is seen as it appears miles away
At ninemileanhour rate the sunlight is seen creeping across the lunar landscape the darkness being broken abruptly by the strong glare of the sun
There is no intervening rosy haze as on earth neither is there twilight after the sun has disappeared
NEBULAR VELOCITIES PROOF OF RELATIVITY The discovery of nebulae of stars mentioned in these columns found to be travelling away from the earth at the tremendous velocities of to miles per second is proof of the Einstein Theory of Relativity according to opinions of famous astronomers in the New York Times
The high velocities it is sug gested are really illusions created by the crumpling of space according to the Relativ ity theory
Light waves travelling through enormous distances of space are distorted
Further the idea that space is curved is veri fied by the data taken on these fastmoving stel lar universes
Dr Clyde Fisher Curator of the American Museum of Natural History said that the validity of the Einstein theory is now generally accepted by most scientists and that the newer discoveries about the stars may lead to proof that cosmic space long held to be illimitable has definite limits and that light in stead of travelling on indefinitely is hedged by this closed universe
Dr Harlow Staple
of the Harvard Observatory said that according to the Einstein theory very distant objects would show spurious velocity of recession
MOONS TEMPERATURE MEASURED By the use of tiny thermocouple two as tronomers at Mt
Wilson observatory have been able to make measurements of the moons tem perature before and after an eclipse says Popular Science
The instruments are so small it is said that if thousand of them were placed in balance it would only need drop of water to equal their weight
Dr Paul Ep stein of the California Institute of Technology has determined from the experiments that the frozen surface of the moon was once cov ered with fiery volcanoes
He found also that pumice of volcanic origin cooled at about the same rate in laboratory as the moon did be tween exposure to the sun and an eclipse
The irregularities on the moons surface are be lieved therefore to be of volcanic origin
EARTH HAS TWO LAYERS OF OZONE Two layers of ozone in the earths atmos phere one due to ultraviolet light from the sun the other due perhaps to particles or corpuscles shot at the earth from sunspots were described at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union
In telling of his studies
Dr Fowle of the Smithsonian Institute said that one of these layers of ozone which is form of oxygen shows an annual period of change depending on the position of the earth in its orbit
He thinks it is due to ultraviolet light which varies in intensity at different times of the year
Unlike this layer the second layer of ozone shows close relationship to sunspots
When the sunspots are at their minimum number it will probably be absent entirely though the observations have not continued long enough to ascertain this
Dr Fowle suggested that some emission of minute cor puscles from the sunspots might account for this layer
NO RAINMAKING POSSIBLE SAYS The profession of rainmaking is that of the quack says the Weather Bureau
No known means have been successful in producing rain over any extensive area
The reason for this says the meteorologists is that the lack of rain is occasioned by lack of moisture and if there is no moisture there can be no rain
Those men who contract to produce rain usually do so at time when rain is about due anyway
Furthermore the Weather Bureau estimates it would require to horsepower to evaporate the moisture of square mile of cloud
MARS ALONE HAS POSSIBILITY OF LIFE Surveying the possibilities of life existing on other solar planets Waldemar Kaempffert in the New York Times finds that Mars alone has the potentialities necessary
He arrives at his conclusions from analyzing the conditions nec cessary for life and subjecting what we know of each planet to the test
The conditions he finds necessary for life as we know it are climate between limited temperatures an at mosphere containing oxygen this also is de pendent on the size and speed of rotation of the planet for only under certain conditions may planets have and hold onto an atmosphere
The next condition is the mass of the planet
If it is too large the attraction of gravity is so great that the organism would have tre mendous weight and be unable to exist
The planet must contain water
The length of the days and the length of the seasons are also determining conditions if life is to exist
Only the earth and Mars have the proper conditions to support life
But Mars says Dr Kaempffert is wornout shrivelled senile world thirsting for water It is agreed that it has vegetation but tough vegetation
And if any sentient beings existed those who built the canali they probably perished long ago
AVIATION AUXILIARY WING TO PREVENT STALLING new device to prevent stalling is the new Fernic Distance Cruiser TIX monoplane which will be put through its tests shortly
The method of preventing stalling very com monsense is the use of an auxiliary wing just over the nose of the plane
There is also an additional landingwheel under the nose which will prevent noseover when the plane lands
The plane has wing spread of sixty feet and is equipped with Wright Whirlwind motors
It is expected to make nonstop flight to some European field this summer
LIGHTS AND SOUNDS INDICATE ALTITUDE ON PLANES By recent development of Dr Alexanderson of the General Electric Company pilots can now have positive indication of their height above the ground even though the weather may be so bad that they cannot see the ground
The device consists of sending radio im pulse to the ground from the plane and pick ing up the same impulse after it is reflected from the ground back to the plane
The ground is picked up as squeal
Whenever the airplane changes altitude by half wave length whistling note goes through com plete tone cycle
By counting the cycles of the tone it is possible to measure the altitude
meter reading from to feet gives the pilot an opportunity to know accurately his altitude within those limits
As the plane approaches the ground the echoes become stronger
memory reader is connected with the meter by which the meter continues to hold the altitude reading and give off the same echo until the altitude is changed
Connected with the device in manner not explained are col ored lights
green light flashing on indi cates that the pilot is feet above the ground while yellow indicates feet and red light shows an altitude of feet
OFFICIAL RECORD FOR ALTITUDE AWARDED NEUNHOFEN Official examination of the recording instru ments used in the Junkers monoplane piloted by Willi Neunhofen indicated that he broke the world altitude record attaining height of feet or less than feet short of eight miles
During his trip Neunhofen passed through temperature range of degrees Fahrenheit for it was degrees above zero on the ground and below when he arrived at the extreme altitude
At the top of his climb he became unconscious from cold and his machine went into glide descending almost four miles be fore he became conscious again
His safety was made possible by an automobile device attached to the steering wheel
As soon as
his hands were taken from the wheel the time when he slipped into unconsciousness an oxy gen flow was released and the motor was shut off thus provoking the glide Neunhofen states that at almost right miles above the ground Leipzig and Magdeburg which are about sixty miles apart appear as though they were only few hundred feet away from each other
FOOLPROOF PLANE CONTEST NEARS CLOSE The contest for the best foolproof plane which the average man or woman can fly spon sored by the Guggenheim Fund for the Promo tion of Aeronautics is nearing close says Lauren Lyman in the New York Times
Very few known planes have already been en tered in the contests which will award prizes of and great deal of mystery sur rounds the actual plans of airplane makers
Believing that the average man or woman will not fly until the foolproof plane has been developed one which does not need an aero nautical expert to safely pilot the Guggen heim Fund is making the conditions that planes must fulfill rather exacting
Eor example one of the nine conditions states that the air craft must show its ability to take off or land on plot feet square surrounded by twentyfive foot obstruction Although the date set for the close of the contest is October only one plane has actually submitted it self at Mitchel Field Long Island for the tests
This is Brunner Winkle Biplane built in Brooklyn
Several other entries are definitely known
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES BIOLOGY
ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION MUST PRECEDE APPLICATION TO MAN Because of the infrequency of reproduction in man and long periods necessary to wait before results are shown scientists trying to determine the causes of heredity the determination of sex etc have been obliged to turn to the lower forms of life said Dr Blakeslee of the Carnegie Institution at Cold Spring Harbor
In this great laboratory many astound ing discoveries are being made about the con ditions that determine what form life is to take
The experimenters have been able in certain instances to bring reversal of sex and to endow the offspring with predetermined char acteristics
When enough knowledge about the determining factors are known it is hoped that they can be applied to man
EVOLUTION CAUSES RACIAL SUBDIVISION That the old conception of races being formed by interbreeding of characteristics is not true is the opinion of writer in the Journal of the American Medical Association
He brings to the support of his belief the work of Sir Arthur Keith and Thomas Huxley famous scientists noted for their work on evo lution
That the cast of features and pigmen tation of the skin are caused independently of racial interbreeding is the conclusion arrived at
The cast of features is said to be due to gland changes and disorders that may accompany environmental changes adaptation or survival as expressed in the evolutionary doctrine
The pigmentation is likewise condition of environ ment
If the thyroid glands take on strange activity declared the writer one might acquire Mongolian cast of countenance
This might also be caused by the endocrine gland when it becomes disordered
MOVIES SHOW BODYS ACTIVITY Motion pictures of the actual operation of parts of the human body were shown by Pro fessor Turner of the Massachusetts In stitute of Technology before the American Child Health Association
By means of rays which were photographed and made into continuous moving film the action of glands in the stomach by which food was digested was shown
In another film the activity connected with the swallowing of food was also portrayed
Professor Turner said he is now making pic tures of the action of the lddneys the heart the growth of the teeth and many other physio logical functions
The pictures are to be used in schools as means of visual education of children on the nature and activity of their bodies
Professor Turner will also exhibit his pictures at the World Federation of Education Associations to be held at Geneva
LIFE MAY BE EVALUATED MATHEMATICALLY That life and the life processes may be evaluated and studied mathematically is the be lief of Professor Donnan writing in Nature London
Our bodies and most of our activity are ruled by the necessity of the conser vation of energy
We are in effect cell build ing organisms obeying the laws of thermo dynamics
That is the part that we understand
Beyond that is the so far inexplicable phe nomenon of the cell building up something which is greater than the sum of its parts
That some new form of energy that we are unaware of may be present is the conclusion
That this phenomenon can be reduced to exact measurement and its activity understood through mathematical formulae is believed to be true
CHEMISTRY MAGAZINE DECLARES RADIUM MON OPOLY EXISTS That monopoly in the sale of radium exists and fabulous profits are made on it while thou sands of people are dying of cancer is the ac cusation of the Industrial and Engineering Chemistry edited by Dr Harrison Howe
The monopoly declared the magazine is con trolled in Belgium where radium costing gram to produce exclusive of mining costs and overhead is sold for gram retail and to gram wholesale
The magazine advocates that special rates be made to research organizations who will prom ise not to resell the material and so depress the market
The magazine declares that the monopoly now demands all the traffic will bear for material which means the difference between life and death MOVIES ICE RINKS MADE OF HYPO DECLARES CHEMIST revelation as to how moving picture studios procure their ice rinks for pictures demanding them is made by Arthur Maas of the Maas Chemical Laboratories in the New York World
Having been the source of supply for the ice for studios Mr Maas feels qualified to speak on the subject
They use he said warm sub stance called hypo made from soda and sul phur
It coats on the floor half an inch thick and can be used for skating just as real ice
Further after being used the hypo can be melt ed gathered up and used over again for an other rink
Mr Maas however doubts whether it will be put into general use for that purpose
For the heat that it exudes is enervating
And as it is well known skaters need the tonio of the cold to stimulate them to activity
MAKING MATCHES AND CIGARETTES FIREPROOF The treating of cigarettes and matches so as to make them less of fire hazard when they are discarded was recommended by the United States Bureau of Standards after num ber of extensive tests
That the cigar ette butts and matches that are dis carded each minute in the United States are responsible for fires causing loss of many mil lions of dollars in damage was the incentive for the work of the bureau
The cigarettes discarded while still glowing fall on inflam mable material such as dry grass and terrible fires are the result
The method of prevention suggested by the Bureau is the coating of the last inch or so of cigarette with water glass sodium silicate solution
By actual tests made the Bureau believes that this will put the cigarette out and reduce fire losses from such causes by
The preventative used for matches will be approximately the same the coating of all but half inch of the match with the water glass so that after the match burns the half inch it will be auto matically extinguished
PRODUCTION OF FAST COLORS Professor Schwartz of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was annoyed because the athletic signs on his campus faded so quickly so as to become indistinguishable
He determined therefore to study the problem and find way of making the colors of printing ink exposed to the sun fast
Starting with the knowledge that fading is caused by the ultraviolet rays of light the professor has discovered that the use of thorium one of the earths elemental con stituents will retard considerably the effect of the rays
Dr Schwartz hopes that his process may be used for fabrics such as cotton and silk as well as for printing inks

CLEVELAND TRAGEDY EXPOSES HORROR OF FUTURE WARFARE That the lesson of the tragedy of the Cleve land Clinic should be more farreaching than the immediate results was the conclusion of Elvira Fradkin writing in the New York Times
The clinic floors piled high with bodies should serve as warning of what to expect from modern warfare which would use gases even more destructive than the nitrogendioxide
For while the nitrogendioxide killed those immediately exposed it lost its effectiveness in the vicinity and did not spread
But some of the gases of modern warfare Lewisite and mus tard gas dropped from fast flying airplane over large city would drop slowly through the city and remain potent for many days
It would fill the subways and homes as well as the office buildings with countless corpses
Re cent tests have shown that planes can accom plish this and thereby paralyze metropolis
CHROMIUMPLATED CUTLERY RE DUCES HOUSEWIFES WORK As the inventor of process of chromium plating home fixtures as well as cutlery Profes sor Colin Fink of Columbia University de scribed the advantages of his process
By elec trolytically coating any metal object with chro mium no drying is necessary
The object may merely be subjected to hot water to clean it and then it may be left alone
The dish towel is doomed he says
The chromiumplated era is about to open
Its use is being extended also to ornaments for women replacing even gold and silver
It resembles platinum and has platinums ability to remain without being tar nished
ALLOYS MAKE METALS USABLE Altho pure metals are considered to be the ones that are valuable still they are not usable in that form
Practically all pure metals stated Sir William Bragg of the Royal Institution of London must be mixed with other metals to form alloys before they be come practically valuable
The number of uses that two metals can be put to will vary with the proportions used so that the uses are just as infinite as the proportions
XRay have shown that the atoms in mixture form different pattern thereby changing the Quali ties of the material
In pure copper the atoms are piled together like spherical shot each sphere touching twelve atoms
When small amount of zinc atoms are added they dis tribute themselves among the copper atoms without disarrangement
When however large amount of zinc is added new atomic pattern is formed
It is this new pattern which gives the alloy the property of brass which is copperzinc alloy
FARM RELIEF BY BYPRODUCT UTILIZATION That farm relief may come from the utili zation of hitherto worthless byproducts of the farm rather than through Congressional meas ures was the belief of chemists expressed at the Annual Exposition of Chemical Industries held in New York
Many new articles are being made from corn and cotton seeds that formerly represented large waste to the farmer
Corn crops that went into the making of corn whiskey are now used to make lacquer
More than fifty chemical products result from the corn kernel
Among these are table oil soap glycerine starch corn syrup etc
Cotton seeds are now used for producing stearins writing paper smokeless oil toilet ware sausage casings and as many equally incongruous things
Among the things also discovered was new sugar called Xylose which can be made from cottonseed husks and is declared by government experts to have absolutely no ten dency to increase the users weight
It is about onethird as sweet as ordinary sugar
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES GEOLOGY ORIGIN OP EARTHOUAKES TO BE STUDIED group of scientists from the Carnegie In stitution at Cold Spring Harbor will shortly begin worldwide study of the origin and activity of earthquakes
The first study will be in the Lake Tanganyika region of East Africa
Other places on the itinerary include the Himalayas Sumatra Java the Philippines China and Japan
Dr Willis who will head the expedition has had worldwide experience with earthquakes
During the severe Chile quake of at Atacama Dr Willis made detailed study
POLAR CAPS MAY FLOOD SEAPORTS DECLARES SCIENTIST That the presence of hundreds of miles of gi gantic ice fields at the poles particularly the South Pole constitutes potential danger to our seaports is the belief of Alfred Rosewood San Francisco scientist writing in the New York American
Although the ice has existed at the poles for long time the possi bility of them being warmed through changes in climate or having some heated body come close to the earth is enough to make us fear ful of fiftyfoot tidal waves sweeping our shores
INSANITY CAUSED BY ENVIRONMEN
TAL MALADJUSTMENTS Insanity is due to large extent to environ mental maladjustments declares professor Wil liam Ogburn of the University of Chicago
Certain neuroses and psychoses indicate that the individual has failed to make the necessary adjustment to his environment
The chance of person of fifteen years being placed in hos pital for the insane is about one in twenty the professor said
People unable to stand the con fusion and disorder of the city might live hap pily in rural sections while others languishing in the rural quiet might be stimulated to healthful activity in the city
FASTING CAUSES MANY DISEASES The modern belief in fasting as cureall for diseases and means of attaining sylphlike figure disregards dangers in the method de clares Albert Parsons Sachs of the New York World The result of studies of the popu lation of Berlin during the war when fasting was quite necessary discloses outbreaks of many diseases as well as mental and nervous degeneration
Although person can fast for number of days and apparently have no illeffects this does not prove that none exist
To carry on the metabolism of the body certain number of calories are necessary to Jnlace hurntup tissue
man requires gen ELECTRIC EYE HAS MANY USES The uses to which the electric eye may be put have been described by the Industrial Bul letin issued by the Arthur Little Corpora tion
This little instrument which responds to the slight fluctuations in the intensity of light may control the admissions to bridge or public hall and count the passersby
It will detect smoke and automatically start an extinguisher it sorts cigars according to the grade as designated by the color of the wrap per
Used in safe it will respond to the outstretched hand of the burglar and ring an alarm
In store it will respond to the flash ing of policemans searchlight and turn on the lights for his inspection
It counts the vehicles on highways and sets window display in operation when passerby stops in front
SCIENTISTS SEEK NATURE OF COLD LIGHT The discovery of what is the source of cold light as emitted by little sea animals consti tutes great problem for science declared Dr Charles Kofoid of the University of Cali fornia before the Pacific section of the Amer ican Association for the Advancement of Science
The mysteries of the luminescent waters of the Pacific and partly of the At lantic have been attributed to the metabolic action of small fish called dinoflagellata
It is Another of Mr Rosewoods conceptions is that the heat of planets depends not alone on the amount received from the sun but that they have natural heat of their own which de pends on the velocity of their passage through the gravitational field of the sun
The faster the speed the more natural heat is radiated away and the lower will be bodys natural temperature
AUTHORITIES NOW BATTLE SOIL EROSION The problem of soil erosion is becoming such serious one that number of interested authorities have gone into the problem to see what can be done to check it
Seven erosion stations are to be established in that number of areas by the Department of Agri culture
The loss yearly due to floods rain wash and gullying is estimated to be
Field and laboratory studies will be made of the terrain where erosion occurs and the most effective methods of preserving the soil will be determined
The work of the De partment of Agriculture will be handled by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Public Roads
MEDICINE erally calories day
If this is not forthcoming flesh is used up to supply the necessary energy
Further toxicosis is in duced in the blood by the change in its chem ical composition when the raw materials neces sary for the production of the allnecessary hormones are missing
So the woman or man who achieves graceful slenderness through fasting may find that he has induced some changes in his bodily structure that may well prove unpleasant
EIGHT HOURS SLEEP NONE TOO MUCH The results of recent tests of the effect of sleep on the body and brain find that eight hours sleep is none too much says the New York Times editorially
From the results of tests of students at Colgate University it was found that four hours of sleep are sufficient to restore the bodily functions to normal
But for the resting of the mind that is not suffi cient
The increase in mental power after awakening seems to have increased with every hour of additional sleep
But it was found also that the recuperative value of the sleep depended on the sleeping equipment and the other physical conditions under which the sub ject slept
PHYSICS believed that these organisms which have spread over the Pacific in great numbers give off light as part of their process of living
Since the action is chemical analysis of the water in which they live is expected to reveal something about them
MEASUREMENT OF ULTRAVIOLET RAYS NOW POSSIBLE The intensity of ultraviolet rays can now be measured by device demonstrated by Dr Rentsehler Director of Research of the Westinghouse Lamp Co
The purpose of this is to prevent people who are taking ultraviolet treatments either from the sun or from machine from receiving terrible burns
For previously no means of measuring the inten sity of ultraviolet was possible
Uranium which is sensitive only to ultra violet rays forms the basis of the device
An electrically charged uranium pole was put into photoelectric cell
The charge generated in the cell by the ultraviolet was transmitted to condenser and stored until given potential was obtained
The energy was then discharged through an argon tube which gave bluish flash
An ink pencil on chart marked the current of the discharge
By varying the current scale of values was obtained which acts now as an actual register or dosage meter which physicians can use
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY PROVIDES VARIED SERVICES The Geological Survey of the United States now celebrating its fiftieth birthday provides services more varied than are understood by the layman says Don Glassman in the New York Times The topographical map which is an abstraction to the man on the street is often very valuable thing to railroad plan ning new line
It is the first thing power company or city seeks for when ready to build dam or new reservoir
It has acted as the agent that searched out mineral deposits and led the way to the development of new lands previously uninhabited
Ascending moun tain peaks and determining their height is part of the work of the intrepid men of the Sur vey
Our knowledge of mountain peaks has come principally from them
It is the Survey also that provides the maps which become so valuable in time of war
For on these maps which often list every house every stream or every hill or valley the strategy of major engagement of war may well be fought
The lack of knowledge of sunken road at Water loo was Napoleons undoing
DIABETES DEATH RATE RISING Because of the richness of the modern diet in food and drink the death rate of diabetes reached new high figure declares the Statis tical Bulletin of the Metropolitan Life Insur ance Company
According to the company the death rate is kept down by the use of insu lin although the drug is no cure
Based on its experience with its million policy holders the company found the death rate to be for each persons
RUBBER HEARTS POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS In these columns the case of Dr Gibb of Dalhousie University keeping cat alive for few minutes by use of rubber heart was mentioned
Now Dr Goldston of the New York Academy of Medicine declares that we must not infer thereby that humans can have the same treatment
writer in the New York HeraldTribune however asks Why not People have had metal replacing many parts of their body in their skull larynx etc
The use of rubber hearts is not impossible declares the writer and viewing the alarming number of deaths from cardiac troubles in children from the age of ten to fourteen he believes that someone will consent finally when his heart is giving out to allow the experiment to be done on him
PHOTO TRANSMITTED ON LIGHT BEAM By device recently developed by Dr Vlad mir Zworykin of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company photograph or printed message may be transmitted over beam of light
The picture or paper contain ing the printed message is placed on cylin der which rotates and moves laterally at the same time
beam of light is projected on the paper and the reflected light gathered by parabolic mirror which passes it through to photoelectric cell
This creates an electric impulse corresponding to the density of the light
These impulses are then passed through gasglow tube which produces the carrier beam of light
This light projected across room is caught by another parabolic reflec tor and passed to photoelectric cell which again changes the impulses into electric im pulses
novel thing about this device is that the actual current is now used to reform the picture
specially prepared paper bathed in waten is on cylinder on the receiving end this cylinder rotating in synchronism with the transmitting
The action of the electricity on the chemicals of the paper by electrolytic ac tion changes the color of the paper and re creates the original image
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES RADIOTELEVISION INDICATOR FOR BEACON WAVES INVENTED Engineers of the Bureau of Standards have developed device whereby one can tell whether radio beacon waves are being maintained on their determined course
An indicator will show any deviation or shift in the waves
It will be known as course shift indicator
The instrument may also find use on plane which is directing its course by the radio bea con
When the needle of the instrument
re mains in the center of the scale the pilot is in the middle of his course
If he deviates from it the needle will swing to one side
RADIOPHONE STATION TO EUROPE OPENED The opening of commercial radiophone ser vice to Europe was initiated recently by the placing in operation of the short wave trans mission center of the Bell system at Lawrence ville
All transAtlantic telephone mes sages to Europe will in the future be relayed to this station and radioed from there
Three separate channels are now in use and it is ex pected that before the end of the year that two more one to Europe and one to Buenos Aires will be in operation
In Europe and in South America similar stations are being built
The transmitting antennae at Lawrenceville are strung on foot steel towers placed feet apart and at right angles to the direction the voice waves travel
MENTAL ILLS TO BE STUDIED IN GREATEST PROJECT The greatest project ever planned into the causes of mental ills including crime general delinquency sleeping sickness insanity epil epsy and others will be started shortly by the Neurological Institute of New York
When they have reached the completion of an endow ment fund of the Institute will have fiftynine leaders in neurology and psychiatry attack sixtyfive important problems of research into the mental ills
The prenatal mental in fluences as well as the organic changes of the brain which take place in early life will receive great deal of attention and the mental life of individuals will be studied completeness never matched before
The Institute is not waiting until its fund is gathered in full but will start its program immediately
MILES PER HOUR OBTAINED IN ROCKET SLED In recent test as reported by Max Valier of Germany in Discovery London speed of miles per hour was obtained in rocket sled
series of rockets were exploded and at the fifth series the speed was already miles per hour as an average
And inasmuch as the last seventy yards was under brake control the higher speed was believed to have been ob tained
Herr Valier who believes that the rocket will be the future means of propulsion is planning rocket ship by which he hopes to make trip from Dover to Calais this summer
The rocket according to him is in the same position as the airplane was in
SECRETARY DAVIS DEFENDS MACHINE AGE Answering recent article of Joseph Cail laux in the New York HeraldTribune on the evils of the machine age
Secretary of Labor James Davis defends our age though admit ting its imperfections
The machine age is lib erating man from physical slavery he says and the advances in science are removing poverty from the masses
Although we suffer from comparison with the golden age of Pericles in Greece for we have not the great men pro duced then still he says in that day the thinkers and artists were all aristocrats and the masses were held in dumb ignorant slavery
Now we have wide dissemination of knowledge
In fact more people can read Shakespeare today than in the days of the bard himself
The common people of today live better than kings in ages past and for this we must thank the great number of our scientific achievements in cluding the mass production of the necessities of life
SHIP TO SHORE RADIOPHONE SERVICE To fill the need of persons aboard ship con versing by telephone with persons on land series of experiments will be started by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company on shiptoshore service
Radiophone will con nect the passenger with the companys station at Deal Beach and from there it is planned the passenger can be connected with any telephone subscriber in the country
The first tests will be conducted between the steamship Leviathan and the Deal Beach Sta tion
The transmitters now used for trans Atlantic telephony will be used in the tests
COLOR ADDED TO TELEVISION IN DEMONSTRATION The ability to transmit not only objects but their color by television was demonstrated re cently at the Bell Laboratories of the Ameri can Telephone and Telegraph Company
On receiver about the size of postage stamp were received the images successively of red white and blue American flag the Union Jack watermelon and pot of ger aniums
The transmitter was located about feet from the receiver wire being used for transmission in this demonstration
The invention is made possible by the use of three photoelectric cells one being able to filter out red one blue and the third green
It would GENERAL THE ETHER STILL EXISTS SAYS LODGE Sir Oliver Lodge denies that the theory of ether filling all space has been exploded
He denies also that Einstein proved that the ether does not exist
The ether must exist de clares Sir Oliver
For without it the heat of the sun could not travel across miles to our earth nor could the heat from our fire place reach us few feet away
Ether is what conducts all electric currents as well as radio waves
In the former case it is not the wire that is the conductor
The wire merely guides the current as rails guide train
Amazing discoveries in physics that are not yet ready for popular consumption are being made at an astonishing rate
Sir Oliver also declared
They are being made so fast that each year makes those of the year before seem antiquated
The prospects for humanity are bright
Although we are barely scratching the surface of universal knowledge we are making progress at an accelerated rate
On properly guided science the hope for the world rests
WEAPONS OF SCIENCE WILL PREVENT FUTURE WARS That the terrible weapons to be developed by science in the future will by their very power serve as moral persuasion against war is the belief of Martyn writing in the New York Times
When men realize the terrific possibilities of the weapons they are using and have the picture of whole nations which are economically interdependent being wiped out they will hesitate to use those weapons
Of all the instruments to be used in the fu ture Mr Martyn finds the airplane and elec tricity to be the most powerful
Poison gas when spread by shells is too uncertain and there is limit to the use of high explosives for the more powerful they become the more possibility there is of premature explosion
Airplanes controlled by radio will spread death and destruction to whole countrysides
Then will come aerial torpedoes which will be guided by radio and detonated at exactly the right moments
Television will enable enemies to seek out the most vulnerable points of each other
And finally the use of electric power transmitted over radio beams will enable ene mies to electrocute armies hundreds of miles away
If science served only warfare said Dr Lewis inventor of Lewisite it would in deed be human curse But the writer feels that the knowledge of this curse will be the most effective bar against war
seem then that the device as it is now is limited to those colors
The image to be portrayed is scanned by flickering beam of light whose intensity varies and which is changed through the photoelectric cell into fluctuating dectrio current
No new apparatus is needed to transmit colors as attachments to the usual television set will add the color
STANDARDS BUREAU DETERMINES RADIO FADING CAUSES Resulting from an extended series of ex periments on the causes of the fading of the intensity of radio waves as received the Bureau of Standards has arrived at seven reasons for the fading
The experiments were conducted with two stations in Maryland using various types of antennae for receiving
The variation of the intensity was studied with relation to the local conditions of the atmosphere tempera tures time of day etc and the following re sults are among those that have been obtained The ray undergoes variation in intensity dur ing its course through the upper atmosphere be fore it gets to the antennae
In the case of nearby stations much fading is caused by in terference between ground and reflected rays
Direction shifts are responsible for certain amount of fading
Much fading is also caused by rotations of the plane of polarization of rays reflected from the upper atmosphere during the sunset period particularly
MANKIND THREATENED BY INSECT WORLD If man is ever wiped off the map it will be due to the onslaught from the insect world according to the New York State College of Forestry of Syracuse University
The great destruction of all kinds of valuable trees has shown the power of rising insect species and new fungus diseases
Means of combatting these insects are unknown and they are rap idly carrying on their work of destruction
Since the animals are more adaptable on earth than man and can escape detection they can carry on systematic work of destroying not only his woods but also his crops and so kill off our race
What is needed according to the college is determined and persistent battle against the insects
BEES NOT SO INTELLIGENT FINDS JOURNAL Bees are not so intelligent as they are re puted to be declares the American Bee Journal editorially even though they may be possessed of other qualities humans find enviable
recent test was conducted to determine their ability to return to their own hive when other hiv were placed close to it
Bees from certain hive were marked and then experi menters placed hives of color similar ta their own in the same neighborhood
Altogether bees returned to their correct hive while wandered into hives other than their own
All this happened during quarter of an hour
In another experiment photoelectric cell was placed at the entrance to hive to determine the number of bees that passed in or out
The number was found to be surprisingly small
MODERN CITY MENACE SAYS CRITIC That the modern city with its tremendous overcrowding and its storing of physical and psychical explosive power is potential menace to the inhabitants themselves is the belief of Stuart Chase as expressed before the League of Industrial Democracy
He showed city to be resting on an ever weakening substruc ture compressing noxious vapors storing hu man carbon dioxide and lying exposed to at tacks from the sky
Gases and clouds from the sky poison vapors from below and carbon di oxide between was his description of the city
Transportation systems overburdened pump us back and forth between places where we would rather not work to places where we would rather not live until saturation point and tragic breakdown results The only solution Mr Chase can see is to have the city planner in complete control

The Jury Brings Its Verdict Editor Science Wonder Stories have read every issue of the new maga zine so far published and hence am going to tell you what thoughts have concerning it will put in my opinion in trial form so lend me your ears alsoi your eyes
The courtroom was crowded with science fic tion fans the jury was ready the judge was seated and then there came low murmur from the massed spectators
Halfway Honest Criticism was coming
Behind him came his assistants Brick bat Critic and Comment among them in formidable array
Stories looked to his friends
He was defendant very much worried
Wonder whos defending old said one fan to another
His answer came with the appearance of Lawyer
Appreciative Praises
Lawyer Praises was not alone it seemed for with him was old Reader
The court having been called to order the trial began
Criticism to the delight the audience put Stories on the stand
After the usual ritual Criticism said gravely have here Mr
Stories some complaints against you and as district attorney adjure you to tell the truth about them object shouted Praises suddenly Mr
Stories is already sworn in Objection sustained said the judge coldly
Then to proceeding to take sip of water Go on Number one complaint is that you express preposterous ideas
Do you Criticisms voice was hard
As you well know the preposterous ideas of one decade are the accepted things of the next Let that go then said the prosecutor un comfortably
Next we find it said that your science is pseudoscience Well said Stories with smile have nearly twenty scientists of high repute on my board of science editors Criticism flushed Well pass that for now your answer is good enough he muttered hastily
Going on to point No
it is said that only halfcrazy ignorant people like your ideas and read them Theres real preposterous idea for you cried indignantly
Such people would never understand instructive stories often writ ten by scientists themselves Criticism was stumped
He turned to Praises
Your witness he stated
Praises looked at Stories
Passed said he the defendants stories spoke for themselves or rather Mr
Stories did Another witness queried the judge
began Criticism when he suddenly felt tug at his sleeve
He looked at Brickbat who sat at his side
Why yes just one more witness Mr
Brickbat will take the stand Brickbat went to the stand confidently
Well what is your testimony asked Cri ticism
read one issue of this magazine and its wonderful came the surprising answer
Those complaints have been proved grounded in an ul timate sense on nothing and Im for the maga zine first last and always Criticism snorted and turned to Praises
suppose youve no questions he grunted
No havent Then the state rests The jury was not out long
What is the verdict asked the judge Guilty Of what Of being the best magazine on the mar ket lit Then presently Praises turns to the judge And the sentence Is long one
hereby sentence Science Wonder Stories to keep going and growing forever Wild applause and court is adjourned
Frank Kelly Kansas City Mo
We found Mr Kellys description of the trial of Science Wonder Stories intensely in teresting as well as containing great deal of subtle truth
Anyway we are happy to receive the verdict and assure our readers that old SW has already begun serving his sentence
Why Is There Heat and Light Through Vacuum Editor Science Wonder Stories In the July and August editions of this singular magazine have been especially at tracted by the educational topics entitled The Problems of Space Flying by Captain Her mann Noordung of Berlin and your editorial entitled The Wonders of Space After having read these articles was left in deep abyss of doubt as to the proba bility of such an enterprise as space flying
am not skeptic
am merely making an attempt perhaps futile attempt to co ordinate logic with guesses
Before allowing the profound thinker to be gin thinking as to whether space or matter was in existence first dont you believe it would be better to have them solve the relationship of what space really consists
Because how could they attempt to solve that ageold ques tion before they know what space is or what it consists of
They contradict their own statements theo ries and hypothesis so often that it makes ones head dizzy
For instance they say that space is vacuum
Have they any concrete proof of it so that they could without doubt prove it to be so
Did they at any time really attempt to prove it
Then they go on to say that light and heat are vibratory motions that on earth these proven facts are transmitted through an un known phenomena an unknown medium filling alt space
But in space which vacuum and is therefore devoid of any such transmit ting medium because vacuum is an abso lutely empty space how then is it possible for the heat and light waves to reach the earth from the sun moon and stars or even to be transmitted for such short distance in space as one million miles
therefore believe that if these same think ers would solve the mystery of space existing at the present time they should then have concrete basis to start working on the prob lem as to whether space or matter was the first to exist
am in favor and believe it would be godsend to the layman for you to publish more such educational articles as The Problems of Space Flying The other stories are merely good to instruct and forewarn the public of future possibilities
am and was an ardent reader of your publications and editorials Mr Gernsback even though this is the first time take the liberty to praise or criticize
am college student and am not ashamed to show your publication around
Hymand Kaidor Bronx
When Mr Kaidor asks how it is possible jr heat and light to reach us through the vacuum of outer space he poses question to which science has as yet found no answer
That is to say it has found no medium through which heat light and even radio waves travel when they pass through vacuum
It was once thought that some allpervading ether was the vehicle that carried the vibrations
The ether theory however has received severe jolt at the hands of Einstein
The latest belief of Ed dington is that there is no total vacuum in outer space but very very thin dissemina tion of some material
That this material acts as carrier is to be doubted
We might say however that there is no necessity of an actual carrier medium for light and heat waves
The mystery of their trans mission through empty space merely defies our imagination
We profess not to be able to conceive of their passing through vacuum
The proof of the vacuum of outer space has been obtained by spectroscopic means
Of course no one has ever been there to test it but our astronomical instruments can do that job just as well
We do not know that an absolute vacuum exists but we know that it is pretty close to one
We agree that one must not lose his mental balance because one scientist makes so called discovery Each person must weight the logic and reasonableness of it before ac cepting it
Does Not Favor Forum Editor Science Wonder Stories The cover illustration of the August issue is the best of the three issues so far published
Paul certainly is doing his duty
am sorry to hear of the death of Garret Serviss
also read of it in Chicago paper that his articles were published in
Why not print some of his stories in Science Wonder Stories picked out The Alien Intelligence by Jack Williamson as the best story in the Aug ust number
The Radium Pool by Ed Earl Repp following close second and The Femin ine Metamorphosis by Keller MD third
am NOT in favor of the proposed new de partment on scientific technical questions and answers
You are taking enough room with Science News of the Month Neither the latter department nor the proposed one should be in science fiction magazine
The latest science news can be obtained in any of the many science news magazines on the news stands
What you publish is not the latest news
So much for brickbats received and read the first six of the science fiction series
All of them were very good About how often are you going to put out these books
liked the paper used in the books and think it would be good kind to use in Science Wonder Stories only it should be little thinner so as not to make the magazine so bulky as it is now
have nothing to complain against the stories as they all have been very good
Jack Darrow Chicago
We are very glad to get Mr Darrows views on the proposed department for the ans wering of questions on science
The asking for vote on the question indicates our desire to know what our readers want
We invite our readers to not only send in their votes but to express their views freely through these col umns
For it is only by your expressions of opinion that we really know what to give you
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES Thorough Classification Editor Science Wonder Stories Am writing primarily to let you know Ive received the first three issues of your glorious magazine and eagerly await the fourth
How ever as secondary matter Ill give you my opinion of your stories
Every story read put into one of three classes Very good
story Id recommend to person Id like to enlist in the ranks of the readers of Science Wonder Stories
story with charm imaginative appeal etc story like to reread
story which is good as long as it lasts but which do not care to reread
rare type of story indeed in our magazine
story in the place of which Id rather see another
An inferior type
Well here goesl
Warriors of Space James Marshall The Alien Intelligence Jack Williamson
The Moon Beasts William Locke
The Boneless Horror David Keller MD
The Reign of the Ray Lester and Pratt
The Marble Virgin Kennie McDowd
The Threat of the Robot David Kel ler MD
The Making of Misty Isle Co blentz
The Menace from Below Hari Vincent
The Eternal Man Sharp
The Feminine Metamorphosis Kel ler The Radium Pool so far Ed Earl Repp
The Diamond Maker Wells
There are none for so far but the Diamond Maker came near being total loss
The Problems of Space Flying cannot so far as can ee be contradicted or criticized in any way
Science News of the Month is huge suc cess with me
see in General Science News that Gar rett Serviss has died
am sure you would be doing many others besides myself favor by reprinting in forthcoming issues of our mag his five great stories The Moon Maid The Deluge The Moon Metal The Conquest of Mars and Columbus of Space
Or how would this do
Put each of the five stories in Science Fiction Series book
Theodore Engel New York City
This is the most carefully thought out classi fication of stories that we have received thus far
We rather like the divisions into which Mr Engel has placed the stories
We are sure that our authors will be very much interested to see where theif stories are placed
In case other of our readers disagree with Mr Engels classification of any story we in vite them to send us their own lists
It would be very interesting to compare them
So far Warriors of Space has been ac claimed an almost universal favorite despite the criticism that has been levelled against some of its science
Mr Pratt Reviews Warriors of Space Editor Science Wonder Stories dont know how far it is proper for one writer to criticize another but there is sci entific mistake in Mr Marshalls story War riors of Space in the June issue that seems to be worthy of some comment
Mr Marshall terminates his story by having the space cars tow Saturn and his moons down and fling them into the sun
Now in the first place the body of Saturns dimensions passing through the solar system as close to the other planets as it would have to on its way to the sun would be extremely likely to upset the whole system just what direction is largely matter of guesswork as it involves the prob lem of three bodies But it is certain that conditions on the earth would never be the same again nor on any of the other planets
However this is not all
If body of even asteroidal dimensions were to collide with the sun it would strike the surface with high ve locity and penetrate quite deeply through the rarefied exterior before stopping
Its kinetic energy would be changed to heat energy and would form center of heat greater than any thing found outside the bluewhite stars far greater than the heat of the surrounding solar layers as can be shown quite easily by calcu lation
This heat is sufficient to build itself up by bringing about further releases of energy from solar sources making the center of heat around the planet still hotter and as the sun acts as perfect gas this intensely heated pocket would explode
It is possible to show that it would blow the upper layers of the sun clean away from it with force so great that its gravitational attraction could not hold them
The sun would thus become Nova and be surrounded by layer of rapidly expanding gas rushing outward at speeds of the order of km
per second or enough to reach the earth in little less than the day
Now this flaming gas reaching the earth day after ward would burn the whole business to cin der in no time at all
body of Saturns size flung into the sun would in fact be enough to make the sun the most brilliant nova in the heavens and life could continue to exist on earth for just about hours after Saturn struck the sun
My authorities are Seeliger Pickering and Russell
Fletcher Pratt Brooklyn
In order to completely answer Mr Pratts criticism of Marshalls Warriors of Space we sent his letter to Professor Samuel Bar ton of the Flower Observatory University of Pennsylvania
Professor Barton is one of the distinguished members of our board of Associ ate Editors
We print herewith without com ment Professort Bartons letter
The annihilation of Saturn and its satellites would cause but very slight disturbance in the solar system
The magnitude of the dis turbance which would be caused by pulling Sat urn through the system would depend upon how closely Saturn approached the other planets in its passage and upon the length of time it re mained their vicinity
The disturbance to the earth would be very considerable If it ap proached closely enough to produce the tidal effects described
In the story the mass of Sat urn was merged with that of the Sun
The effect of adding this mass to the Sun would be to decrease the mean distance of the earth from the Sun by the comparatively small amount of miles and to decrease the length of the year by about five hours
Saturn might easily pass through the system and have but little greater effect than this upon the earth
The disturbance possible would range between this and that caused by an actual collision
The effects of the fall into the Sun are sub stantially as described in the second part of Mr Pratts letter
However as Saturn was drawn in it would greatly increase the speed of its revolution about the Sun and would not strike its surface perpendicularly
may state that the attractive force of the Sun upon Saturn is equal to the weight of tons
This enormous force would cause Saturn to move only inches in the first second
If Saturn were pulled straight into the Sun by the Suns gravitational pull in other words if it fell into the Sun years would be consumed in the fall
But the pull of the Sun varies inversely with the square of the distance and thus increases at great rate with the approach of the Sun
This gives some idea of the power ascribed to the space cars which pulled Saturn into the Sun in minus five days if read aright for in chapter nine wc are told that over days elapsed from the departure of the space cars from the earth before Donald gave the command pull and in the tenth chapter we are told that on the thirtieth day from the departure Louise no ticed the startling events caused by that same wonderful pull
The professor must have been bit excited when he stated that the light from Saturn takes three days to reach us
fear that the warriors of space from the ninth satel lite of Saturn which apparently was left be hind will sooner or later wreak their ven geance on the earth
The rings of Saturn suppose were placed by Donald on the fingers of Louise

Then thought just what does it mean
All can say now is that have great deal of respect for the author of Continued on page NEXT MONTH Science Questions and Answers AST month we asked our readers to vote on the Science Ques tions and Answers Department We received great many letters from our readers who asked us to enlarge the scope of the magazine by printing answers to scientific questions that they might ask of interest not only to them but to all readers
We put the question to vote and attached voting coupon which was to be filled out by the readers themselves
As we go to press we are in receipt of thousands of coupons fully of the votes tabulated show the unmistakable trend of our readers wishes and that is they vote overwhelmingly for new de partment
Accordingly Science Questions and Answers starts in the Oc tober issue
In this department we aim to answer scientific questions which our readers may ask and we will publish those questions and answers which we feel are of interest to the majority
If anything puzzles you in any of the various branches of science such as Astronomy Biology Radio Chemistry Medicine Physics Electricity or any general scientific topic write to us but please do not ask more than three questions at time
This new department does not answer individual questions by mail and of course it will be impossible to publish all questions
The edi tors will try to answer as many each month as space permits
There is of course no charge for this service
Address all questions to the Editor
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES The Life of the White Ant By MAURICE MAETERLINCK The Celebrated Poet and Author The Termites the white ants are small insects living in underground col onies without ever coming into the air
Their subterranean homes are marvel lously built with provisions for ventila tion central heating system etc
and are topped by cupola sometimes twelve feet in height
Millions of blind ter mites live within the nest divided into castes
Whenever the workers leave the termitaria they use tunnels working their way into trees furniture and walls of houses which they devour silently and invisibly with fearful destruction
All termites are subject to an iron discipline terrible tyranny which Maeterlinck compares to Bolshevism in its extreme
Maeterlinck does not hesitate to de clare that from many points of view the civilization of the termites grim and re pellant though it be is ahead of our hu man civilization that these insects pos sess more scientific genius than is found in men
As in The Life of the Bee the author has drawn from the story of the white ant profound and moving philoso phy of human life and its ultimate devel opment and goal
Dr David Kellers story The Human Termites is based upon this book of Maeterlinck and anybody wanting to have better knowledge about Ter mites should by all means read it
PRICE Add for Pottage STELLAR PUBLISHING CORP Park Place New York The Reader Speaks Continued from page that simple sounding title
If were the mas ter of dozen languages might possibly col lect dazzling array of bewildering adjectives that would exactly express my feeling toward Scientific Fiction
The first thing scientific fiction ever meant to me was recreation
used to pounce on every periodical with the idea of seeing my favorite authors latest brainstorm yes called them brainstorms
Now however Sci ence with me has become hobby recreation and source of educational experience
have perused textbooks laboratory manuals and trea tises on science of all imaginable sorts
And then chanced upon my first issue of Mr Gemsbacks original gift to the world of scien tific literature
Today Scientific Fiction to me means the easiest route to complete knowl edge of the relationship of physical and mater ial facts to myself and this planet we live on
This last statement feel brings my ideas and the printed word into the closest conceivable affinity
thank Mr Gernsback again for his second original and startling tribute to modern liter ature
Cooke Frankfort North Dakota We were very glad to get Mr Cookes sin cere and understanding view of the value of science fiction
The evolution he says he pass ed through is quite characteristic of that of most intelligent people
We think it quite natural that at first they view science fiction something absurd extravagant and fantastic
We are quite willing that it be so
For science fiction comes on them as such new and startling experience that viewing it from the standards of the cold realistic fiction they know they are unable to swallow it
But it is only after they have become acclimated to the thrilling adventures of science fiction and are able to mentally bridge the gap between these adventures and the world of the future that they can write letters such as this one of Mr Cooke
Prom Harl Vincent Having just finished reading the July issue of Science Wonder Stories from cover to cover feel that must write to you to ex press my pleasure and appreciation of its gen eral excellence
It can not fail to succeed after the flying start of the first two issues
am especially pleased with the makeup of my own story as printed
The titling and subtitling of the chapters was done to per fection and improved the story considerably
The concluding installment of THE REIGN OF THE RAY is great
Harl Vincent New York City
We print without comment this letter from Mr Vincent one of our finest authors Edu tor
On Lifting the Leviathan Editor Science Wonder Stories have received the first two issues of your new magazine and desire to congratulate you both as regards the contents and appearance of this publication
The stories which seem to me to be best are The Alien Intelligence The Reign of the Ray and the Boneless Horror These three stories seem to be distinctly out standing the last especially is of quite un usual type
The first shows distinctly skill ful and alluring use of imagihation and is in my opinion the best of the three
was much interested in your leading article on gravitation but have you considered the fact that whilst the weight of body varies from planet to planet the mass or inertia is the same on earth or in empty space
In other words to raise body weighing lbs we must exert greater force than lbs
weight the magnitude of this extra force de pending upon the rate at which it is raised
If we suppose that the man on our imaginary small planet were exerting maximum force of lbs we obtain the following rather in teresting results The ship to be raised to height of feet would require minutes which would impose rather strain upon the physique of our strong man
Further if he now released the ship it would still continue to rise another inches and would then gradually fall back to the ground reaching it in seconds
The above results can be obtained by simple arithmetic from the two well known laws of kinetics that Impulse varies as momentum and Space passed over the product of ve locity by time
These aspects of the question as indeed the whole discussion although purely theoretical are nevertheless very interesting to work out to their logical conclusions
approve very much of the good stout paper on which your stories are printed
Bain Brussels Belgium Mr Bains analysis of the problem of lifting the Leviathan out in comparatively free space is indeed very interesting
From mathematical point of view his conclusions are undoubtedly correct
That it would be quite strain on the strong man we grant
But we believe that for the privilege of being able with his physi cal strength alone to lift what on earth is tons one must be quite willing to risk the strain
We must look on the feat as quite phenomenal under any conditions
However we are very glad to get Mr Bains analysis Editor
Describes Science Correspondence Club Editor Science Wonder Stories have been wanting to write to you ever since the inception of your magazine but have been so occupied that was unable to communicate with you until this time
As you will notice by the letter head also am member of the Science Correspondence Club introduced to the public last issue through my fellow member
might add this to his reference
The clubs aim is to bring together those who wish to compare their pet ideas and theories with others scientifically inclined and to hold debates on the same by mail
Thus correspondence can be kept up indefinitely
The need for such club was often expressed in the columns of your former organ of science fiction but it seems to have been put off until recently
Now feel inclined to cruelly toss few more brickbats at the battlescarred veteran authors who have earned it by inserting glaring scientific fallacies in their stories
Warriors of Space The men of Dione had disintegrator ray that destroyed every thing but gold
Therefore as they had none of that element which woufd be needed to re flect the ray their own apparatus would be de stroyed and the Dionians would be as utterly annihilated as the Tellurians if the ray had time to generate itself
The Marble Virgin advance the same arguments as the other criticizers of the story
Moreover the statue was marble all the way through while the human body consists of dif ferent organs with variations in the form of pro toplasm
Again hold it inconceivable that consciousness can be endowed as the result of physiochemical reactions
This has never been proved to the contrary and never will be
Leonard May Jersey City
We were particularly happy to get Mr Mays letter as we are very much interested in the activities of the Science Correspondence Club
That there exists place for such club composed of people interested in the future of science and in discussing general scientific ques tions there remains no doubt
We are happy to extend any support possible to make the club sCiccess

The universe is indeed large enough ac cording to Mr Valets calculations to afford us breathing space
We must be impressed with our own insignificance to realize that even traveling with the speed of light it would take us hundreds of millions of years to reach the outermost limits of the universe
In fact there are stars in existence that we will never see because their first rays of light after they came into existence hundreds of millions of years ago are still travelling toward us through space and have not yet reached us
Why Is Uranus Neglected
Editor Science Wonder Stories Im writing this little epistle to air my views on Our new magazine
The very first issue sure clicked with me
The second was even better all the stories were excellent and the best were unusually good
The best story in the first issue was according to my way of thinking
Jack Marshalls superb Warriors of Space For sheer daring it almost took my breath away
Running dose second was Kennie McDowds story The Marble Virgin It is hard to choose between these excellent stories as to which is best
The Reign of the Ray failed to go over with me for some reason or other
Just didnt hold my interest
As have remarked above the second issue was by far the best
The paper was far and away of better class and didnt resemble Western maga zine paper so much
The size of the magazine looms big in my eyes for it makes nice looking magazine die size seems to give it distinction
Man but Artist Paul is sure put ting out the goods for our infant maga zine
The story that took the cake in the second issue was Jack Williamsons The Alien In telligence Talk about story
also greatly admired Harl Vincents The Menace from Below Why is it that our writers never touch upon the planet Uranus
dont remember having read story that even mentioned the planet
Is there no possibility of its being inhabited
Why cant we have some stories by Edwin Stoat
His Flight to Venus was sort of masterpiece in science fiction
sequel to this story would go well with me
like especially stories of the moon
The best story have read on this subject was The Death of the Moon We ought to have more stories like Mono rail To the Moon by Proxy and Re prisal These stories were models of what short but interesting science fiction story ought to be
Just few words more and will close
see nothing but rosy and successful future for Science Wonder Stoeies for there is no getting around the fact that they are interesting and instructive and when say this know what am talking about for have read all my life
In fact that is all do
So just keep Harl Vincent Jack Williamson Kennie McDowd and Jack Marshall at work not to mention Paul and sit still in the boat and dont worry about the future

NEWCOMER ASCIATE Broadway New York The Reader Speaks Continued from page It is very interesting to get Mr
Hoods analysis of the first two issues of Science Wonder Stories
We are glad to note also that he liked the second issue better than the first
The majority of comments we received about the June issue were on the stories that Mr
Hood picked as the best The Marble Virgin and Warriors of Space Our per sonal belief is that despite the criticism against its scientific faults The Marble Virgin hasi an excellent construction and plot
In many ways it embodied characteristics of the model science fiction story
Kennie McDowd has promised us sequel to it
Mr Hoods question about Uranus is cer tainly well taken
Uranus is one of the planets about which we know little
It is next to Neptune the most distant planet in the solar system and is supposed to have climate ex ceedingly cold
It has further no atmos phere and the chances of its being inhabited are quite remote
However some day an enterprising sciencefictionist will study the planet and evolve surprising story about Uranus
We are contemplating for future quarterly story about the moon that will make history
Religion and Science Compatible Editor Science Wonder Stories have just been reading What Science Fiction Means to Me and The Reader Speaks in the July issue of Science Wonder Stories
was surprised at the fact that all the letters in both departments came from the antipodes of our country
California and New York are unusually well represented while from the middle west there is not on single chirp
Is the spirit of scientific ad venture in this part of the world so dead as all that
Science Wonder Stories is living up to the promises you made in your letters to us charter subscribers
The Alien Intelligence is very good
There comes up that comparison with The Moon Pool again
am one of the unfortunates who missed The Moon Pool and would appreciate information as to where copy of it can be obtained
The Reign of the Ray is too complicated in plot and contains too much matter irrelevant to the scientific part
However whats one mans meat is another mans poison The possibility of an immense bubble under the earths crust inhabited or not is captivating and altogether possible much more so than the brain surgery contained in The Menace from Below The Problems of Space Flying brings out lot of obvious points apparently overlooked by space fiction writers
However such detail properly belongs in an article not in fiction
Keep on telling us just little about the stories for next month
It whets our appe tite for the feast in store for us
think the subject of the relationship of the structure of the atom to that of the uni verse and the possibility of our universe be ing composed of atoms of matter in super universe where second of time is an aeon to us is especially interesting and plausible
It also has great possibilities as scientific inter pretation of that future abode where time shall be no more The Fundamentals of Re ligion are becoming more and more compatible with science as research goes on
The man who says that scientific study made him an infidel is either an infidel from the start or is singularly unobservant
It is not too far fetched to believe that even the miracles re corded in the bible were the workings of natural laws with which we are not yet acquainted
impatiently await the arrival of the first quarterly
Foltz Indianapolis Indiana
We agree with Mr Foltz in that we see no incompatibility between scientific knowledge and true religion
By true religion we mean that feeling of seeing plan in the universe and drawing lesson or philosophical con clusion regarding our place in it and our mode of conduct
The great men of religious thought and teaching and the great men of science have always understood one another
Therefore the world of Einstein and the world of great religious leader unbiased and not prejudiced by dogma and cant should be one

Dont Do It Again
Science Wonder Stories have the July issue of your new Science Wonder Stories the one with the ship on the cover
May comment on it
like the general makeup of it very much though there seems to be too much ink on the illustrations
They are very dark
have no criticism to make on the stories and their au thors but The Cover
It is very misleading as it does not have bearing on any story and not much on the article as can see
An edi torial doesnt warrant an illustration even if it is by you
Besides the cover is too well too ordinary commonplace
Oh Mr Gemsback dont do it again
Wouldnt The Alien Intelligence have made much finer illustration
Wouldnt it now
So Paul heres to more fantastic and start ling cover drawings
The more daring the bet ter
Thats what we all most of us want
Your illustration for The Moon Pool long ago was marvelous
And Mr Gernsback hope that formidable array of scientists you have as associate editors wont influence you otherwise
You probably know what youre about though but remember you have compe tition The Paper
Why oK why do you in sist on giving us magazine so bulky
Make it thinner even if you use cheaper paper
Make it thinner
The Quarterlies are the worst of fenders in this line
The Table of Contents
Its table of contentment but only list stories articles and the Science News department in it
Leave out the questionnaire Reader Speaks etc
Other Publications
If you put out so many different books and magazines like the Quarterly and Science Fiction Series wont you run out of stories
That would be tough
It would be good
Then you could publish lot of reprints like Cummings Girl in the Golden Atom Englands Flints and Austin Halls tales
Why dont you print more of Wells also
He wrote plenty
Anyhow dont overdo publishing science fiction on account of your readers not being able to keep up with you
would like to see more shorter stories
By the way why have you quit using the word scientifiction when you popularized it
Is that word copyrighted
If it is it shouldnt be
Anybody ought to be able to use it
Dont put any articles in fiction magazine unless they are as good as The Problems of Space Flying see The Ark of the Cove nant is heading for Air Wonder Stories
This is one of the best works of scientifiction there is
Lester Anderson Hayward California
The editor is genuinely grieved that Mr Anderson did not like the cover for the July issue
Most readers who wrote in thought it was good
Truthfully we dont mind his saying that he didnt like it that it wasnt truthful that it was too flamboyant
But to have him say it was too commonplace is surprising
For commonplaceness is what we are desperately trying to escape from
And if Mr Anderson is right then it shall never be again We therefore invite the comments of our readers to this question
Was the July cover too com monplace The word scientifiction is trade symbol
The other of Mr Andersons comments were duly appreciated
They were brief sensibly stated and sincerely felt
Regarding the masterpieces of science fiction we have many in store for our readers as for example The Human Termites in this issue
The stories to come in Science Wonder Stories will make new high water mark in the production of science fiction
word to the wise Save all your issues

The Reader Speaks Continued from page Baffles His Friends on Science Knowledge Editor Science Wonder Stories My apologies for not sending in my views sooner but better late than never is my motto
am one of your younger readers
wan to say that the magazine is wonder
Ive got my friends baffled on the superior knowledge of science have over them
Now few criticisms and questions since they are less than the good parts
In The Feminine Metamorphosis the won derful woman biologist changed the women in shape and countenance
Dont you think that at the same time their views would change to those of male
It certainly seems logical
And then again please ask Dr Keller why Detective Taine never grows old
remember in the last story he was in the events took considerable time and at the end he was very old
Yet here he is apparently none the worse for the years he has lived
didnt like The Reign of the Ray it was too dry The Moon Beasts was great
Give us more of Locke
The Alien Intelli gence was very good story
That new author Sharp is good dont let him get away
His Eternal Man was one of the most interesting stories Ive read so far even though it is short
Guess this is enough for some time
Will write next month
With best wishes for suc cessful magazine Sidney Rishen Brooklyn
Mr Rishens question about the women in the Feminine Metamorphosis was very well put
The answer is that sex is determined by two sets of characteristics called the psychical and physical
The psychical are the basic qualities of the feminine nature such as mother love vanity capriciousness unstability desire for love and affection etc
The physical char acteristics are the more obvious physical ones such as feminine organs size and shape of body coloring and type of skfn tone of voice etc
Now as we understand it what happened was that only the secondary characteristics were changed by the biologists
The primary basic characteristics remained the same
Dr Kellers Taine is one of those char acters who suffer great many adventures
Therefore what happened in the Feminine Metamorphosis may be simply an incident sandwiched in between those Mr Rishen re ferred to
From Prize Winner Editor Science Wonder Stories just this evening opened my latest copy of Science Wonder Stories and you can imag ine what an agreeable surprise it was to find that my attempt at an essay had been awarded first prize for the third month of the contest on What Science Fiction Means to Me It is not every day that an individual finds that has been unexpectedly dumped into his lap so to speak
think that it was very agreeable feature of your contest not to let the author of prizewinning letter know of his good for tune until he has had chance to find it out through casual perusal of the pages of the magazine
The surprise is much more pleasant than if he had been notified by letter before hand
shall naturally be glad to get the when it arrives but the most gratifying of all is the fact that my humble effort was deemed worthy of being given the honor of first place in contest of such nature and when so many far more intelligent and experienced people than sent in their splendid contribu tions at the same time
Swiggett Jr Las Vegas New Mexico
We feel that Mr Swiggett need not apolo gize for his letter
It was good one in every sense being concise expressed in clear under standable language sincere and personal

SCIENCE WONDER STORIES The Reader Speaks Continued from page Terrible
Editor Science Wonder Stories Considering the facts fail to see how am to congratulate you upon your new maga zine
To begin with as did not see any June issue of the book dont have any idea whether it was better or worse than the issue of July and in my opinion it would not have far to go to be any worse
received the issue of July and was very glad to do so until opened it whereupon was frankly disappoint ed
had not counted upon this business of Story in Two Parts Part or Story in Two Parts Part II and in three places too
Under certain circumstances it is It is even expected but in the case of the story The Reign of the Ray cannot see the necessity of dividing the story into two parts as you have done the second part of the story is only pages long and most certainly could have been put in one installment
The story The Alien Intelligence is quite good story spoiled by dividing it into two parts al though it may be necessary
There are some stories which are much better if issued in serial form but that depends upon the type of the story
The Moon Pool was such story and very good one it was
As said before was frankly disappointed upon not receiving my June issue and upon seeing the lack of complete stories in the July issue
Another thing did not like was The Problems of Space Flying will admit that read it through and found it worthy of no tice in fact it is worth much study it is the principle of the thing that Im interested in
Its like this if want to for any reason study such it would not be hard task to get some thing on the subject in the library or some such place as that therefore do not like the idea of buying book to read for pleasure and relax ation only to be faced by some such discourse which reminds one of Einsteins theory or some thing equally interesting
The other stories seem all right but they certainly could be better by far
Science News of the Month is an excellent feature
also enjoyed the prize letter contest and congratulate you upon the excellent choice of first prizes
always enjoy the readers letters and have discovered that many of them show actual signs of intelligence al though have my doubts about some of them
for one dont see anything to this picture and biography idea which one of them sug gested neither can see why he dislikes Co blentz because he is very good writer
Until lately there was never an issue of your former magazine that did not read clear through and for long time had one of every issue ever put out and if its worth it intend to do so with Science Wonder Stories also
Science Wonder Stories seems to be pretty good book but it certainly can be im proved upon and suggest More complete stories
No short serials
Forget the authors and their histories
More stories and better ones
Futuristic stories and those involving the dimensions
And lot con cerning Interplanetary travel
DeVere Shillito Beaver Falls Pennsylvania
We fee
withered under Mr Shillitos in dictment
At least that is the first sensation
But then we must calmly reread his letter and analyze it
Our fighting spirit is aroused now and we will defend Science Wonder Stories
But only where it will bear defence
If Mr Shillito is right we must admit it
In the case of the Reign of the Ray or any other story Mr Shillito should remember that the size of the book is definitely fixed at pages
If therefore we had run the ten extra pages to finish completely the story we would have been obliged to leave out some other story
Which wouldnt have been fair to our readers
We believe that Mr Shillito is mistaken about being able to get the Problems of Space Flying easily
We brought this book over from Germany at great expense had it translated here and illustration cuts made before we could assemble it for publication
But we are very much interested in Mr Shillitos criticism and because he has something to say we invite him to write us again
From Lover of Astronomy Editor Science Wonder Stories Your first issue has so affected me as to cause me to write and wish you the best of success in your new undertaking
It was cer tainly very fine one and interesting as well
Needless to say have become regular reader and booster of your magazine although buy my copies on the newsstand
notice that you have most of the good authors with us and also some new ones who seem to know their science fiction
Now if you could only induce Edgar Rice Burroughs to join up with you everything would be jake Dont hesitate at all about reprinting some classics by Jules Verne or any of the old mas ters
They are always welcome and appreci ated
Above all more interplanetary stories do not hesitate to say that am literally fascinated by the study of astronomy
And your magazine has done quite lot to promote that feeling
have studied astronomy in my leisure time for several years and have re ceived great deal of pleasure and knowledge from it
would be glad to correspond with anyone who is also interested in astronomy
am seventeen years old
have nothing to say about the Science News Department except that it is quite interesting
would like to see more astronomical news
notice by way of your advertisements that you are the publishers of number of maga zines on the different sciences such as radio and aviation magazines etc
Well why not add to your list of publications magazine based wholly on interplanetary stories which might be called Interplanetary Stories Maga zine By this time you realize that most of your readers prefer the interplanetary type of story
see no reason in not accommodating them
believe that the science of astronomy is more interesting and to my mind even more important than the science of aviation or radio
And dont see why the science of astronomy could not be presented by an astro nomical fiction magazine
am certain that it would stand upon its own feet
And now would like you to consider this problem
Most interplanetary authors in trans porting their characters from our earth to dif ferent planets use as means of traversing the void separating these bodies space ships
The authors have recognized most of the ob stacles and dangers standing in the way of space explorers and have eventually explained them or else have left them for the reader to solve
Some of these obstacles are of such nature as to make them probable of being solved or overcome in the future
They are the nullification of gravity proper amount of velocity on starting friction from earths atmos phere travelling at speed of light etc
Now after great deal of thinking and much discussion over the various obstacles of space travelling my friend and have come across another obstacle and try as we might we could not give any satisfactory explanation to over come it
Perhaps you have heard it before or thought of it but am vitally interested in getting it solved if possible
We know that the air about us presses down upon everything with weight of approximately pounds per square inch
We also know that there is corresponding pressure exerted from our body which quite neutralizes the air pres sure
If this pressure was not exerted by us the air pressure would be so great that we would cave our bodies would simply fall in
The same way about if the air did not exert the pressure that it did upon us we would burst from the pressure exerted within us
Now travelling in space ship we would have lifegiving air within the ship which would press upon the occupants and even the ship with weight of pounds per square inch
As the space surrounding the space ship could give back no corresponding pressure to neutralize it it stands to reason that the ship would bust from the inside
Which is an ex ample of what our bodies would do if we had no pressure from the air
We have conjectured upon it very much but without success
What do you think about it
And now believe will stop as have already wasted much of your time if you have read it until here
Again wish you the best of success in your undertaking

IGNATZ BRING Formerly of Schlitz Hotel The Reader Speaks Continued from page We can agree with Mr Fox that Astron omy is one of the most fascinating of sciences and one of which we still know relatively little
The possibilities of our vast universe are as limitless as the universe itself and the editor is willing to go on record as saying that some where in the universe are worlds in which every conceivable thing within the realm of nature has happened
Regarding the pressure on the space flyer Mr Fox should realize the differ ence between it and the human body
Our bodies are made of plastic flesh within and over framework of bone
Fifteen pounds per square inch is quite large pressure for the flesh to endure for it has little resistance
But space flyer would be constructed of metal
Boilers in operation now use pressure of steam of and pounds per square inch inside whereas outside is only the pressure ot air
And only recently we learned of boiler which will use pressure of pounds per square inch
So the mere difference of pres sure of pounds per square inch in space is trifle to the space flyer
Captain Noordungs article in this issue brings this point out nicely
Mr Pratt Not AntiSoviet Editor Science Wonder Stories note with considerable interest letter from Mr Maurice Rabinowitz in criticism of The Reign of the Ray in the August issue of Science Wonder Stories
Permit me to say that think this criticism is based on wholly inaccurate view of the story
It was not our intention to express either approval or disapproval of Bolshevism or Fas cism as matter of fact wo dont think much of either system
suppose Mr Rabinowitz draws his idea that we wrote the story from an antiSoviet point of view from the fact that we had the United States and Italy fighting on the same side against the Soviets from the fact that we said the Italians had considerable success and from the methods of warfare we ascribed to Bolshevist Russia
Now these things were put into the story not because we are antiSoviet but as result of careful and we hope scientific consideration of the possibilities of the case
To take up the point in order The war as we outlined it
Nearly all European governments as well as our own have refused to recognize the Soviet and this recognition has been in many cases almost in sulting
On the other hand our own govern ment and all those of Europe maintain the most cordial relations with Facist Italy
We considered that war would be far more likely to occur between governments which are at enmity than between those
which are friendly to each other
Thats only cdaimon sense
Moreover the Soviet represents system radi cally different from any other in Europe and if it ever got into the control of such fanatics as we have mentioned for the sake of the story it is not at all improbable that Russia would set out to clean up the world as Revo lutionary France did in the past
The Italian victories in the story
Italy has large army it is by the common judg ment of military authorities in high state of efficiency if war were to come it is only logical to suppose it would meet with success
The Soviet methods of war
Every war in history goes to show that when country is surrounded by enemies its methods of war fare take on frantic and violent character anything to win The Germans resorted to the use of poison gas Napoleon levied on conquered provinces for soldiers and provisions without paying for them General Sherman burned out Georgia and so on
When na tion is fighting for life it has no scruples at all
trust that you will be able to bring this communication to the attention of the enthusi astic Mr Rabinowitz and would like to ask hini whether there are any other points on which he is hazy

We publish without comment this letter of Mr Pratt in answer to Mr Rabinowitz

SCIENCE WONDER STORIES BOOK REVIEWS THE EINSTEIN THEORY EX PLAINED AND ANALYZED by Samuel Guggenheimer pages stiff cloth covers size
Pub lished by MacMillan New York
Reviewing briefly book which is criticism oi the Einstein Theory is qnite an impossible task
What the presentreview can best do is to indicate what the book contains the method of approach and its value to possible readers
That Mr Guggenheimer is equipped for his task no one can doubt
His method of analy sis is both clear and incisive
He rips his way through theories and abstractions seeking for their logical worth
In this book he takes the Einstein method of approach and proceeds to lay bare its logical faults
He finds in fact that the chief basis for the special Theory of Relativity the constancy of the velocity of light irrespective of the speed relation between the source of light and the observer is an hypo thesis only
He claims that Einstein never proved it or if Einstein did prove it it came as corollary to the theory that depended on it
Like dog eating his own tail
The present reviewer finds that Mr Guggenheimers criti cism is sound
The famous Lorentz equations which are the basis of the Special Theory of Relativity are undoubtedly based on something which is taken for granted
Mr Guggenheimer however becomes so enamored of his subject that he often wanders off into his own abstruse speculations leaving the reader far behind him
great deal of concentration and more than an ordinary edu cation is necessary to follow the writer
The book however is exceedingly well written for scientific work
It suffers how ever from lack of cohesiveness
If Mr Guggenheimer had given in simple terms all that Einstein postulated in all his theories and then proceeded to analyze each the reader might have been able to follow him with feeling as to where it was all going to lead
But while one may agree with the independent conclusions arrived at by Mr Guggenheimer he is apt to give up in weariness the attempt to discover what it is all about
THE CURATIVE VALUE OF THE MIND by Marcus Rosenberg
pages stiff cloth covers
Published by Dean Company New York
This is one of the most curious books that the reviewer has had the pleasure of reading
In its ponderous style it is reminiscent of Kant and the reasoning is at times as lofty as that of the famous philosopher
Especially the deductive reasoning to explain such mun dane things as cold or headache
It is combination of mysticism transcendentalism and empirical medicine
It is with curious sense of futility yet with lingering hope that one turns page after page searching for the beginning of what the title promises
Instead the first half of the book is composed of learned discourse on the fourth dimension the laws of conservation of energy and matter and the Quantum Theory
In the second part one gathers from the index that we are approaching the heart of the sub ject
The author treats of colds headaches vaccination and the formation of habits
But gather few samples of the reasoning used to explain these bodily afflictions and the possi bilities of curing them
Colds he says have something to do with the nerves of smell
When the soul is not aware that it is in the body respiration takes place irregularly and the nerve
of smell want to transmit the irregular Breathing vibrations to the soul
Since the soul is not aware that it is in the body the nerves of smell have trouble in reaching the souk Hence the pain ful sensation known as cold Note Not colds and sneezing results representing the irregular breathing vibrations to which the nerves of smell were subjected An interesting theory of the nature of heat and light is presented in the idea that there is no heat in the rays ofi the sun or any other rays
The light rays striking an object release intraatomic energy of the object in the form of heat
Therefore we do not receive heat we generate it ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL by Catherine Mackenzie pages il lustrated
stiff cloth covers size
Published by Houghton Mif flin Company New York
This book is an interesting account of the life of the man known to be the inventor of the telephone
Written by one who spent great many years with him it is well documented and undoubtedly possesses all the facts about Bells life that one would wish to know
In fact it possesses many more than most readers would wish to know
Miss Mackenzie appears to have been smothered by the mass of material she possessed and while she gives surfeit of exact dates and facts she nowhere gives real illuminating insight into the man
The book has great deal of interest how ever for those unable to appreciate the mental attitude that greeted Bells announcement of the telephone or speech by telegraph as it was called
Curiously enough we learn that Bell did not have the equipment of an electrical expert
His ideas and feelings on the subject came from his knowledge of sound as applied to speech
He was in fact lifelong expert on elocution and was intensely interested anything that related to speech
We find him instead of the typical inventor of that day starving in garret young enthusiastic man with plenty of friends and enough money to keep the wolf from the door
It is said about him that if he had known more about electri city he would never have invented the telephone
Much of the book is taken un with the years consumed in patent suits directed against him and by him
There is also some interesting material on his less well known scientific ex periments on the graphophone the heavier thanair flying machine and on scientific breed ing of animals
The description of the way in which the actual discovery of the working tele phone came has value because of the light it sheds on the importance of chance in scientific discoveries
AN HOUR ON HEALTH by Morris Fishbein MD
pages stiff cloth covers
Published by
Lippincott Company Philadelphia
This book by the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association is part of onehour series on various topics that the pub lishers are presenting
It is quite common sense collection of the best authorities on such subjects as exercise diet general living habits digestion sleep and vacations
Dr Fishbeins counsel in all things is moderation
That ap plies to exercise eating healthful things taking cathartics and breathing
One could hardly quarrel with his conclusion since they seem to be founded as much on the experience of nor mal living people as on abstruse medical science
While he praises golf as form of re laxation and exercise for business men he cites the fact that every year number of enthusi asts drop dead on the links from heart disease
It was evidently case of good thing over done
Dr Fishbein finds no great evidence to sup port the contentions of the vegetarians that their possibility of life is greater than meat eaters
Those who eat moderately of meat he finds have just as much chance for long life as the vegetarian
And he adds dryly Meat eaters make better company because they have sense of humor The author treats most food fads contemptu ously
He finds that they are based principally on the desire of some commercial interest to exploit particular food
The raisin fad was one
warfare between the eat white bread and do not eat white bread Interests now rages
But what Dr Fishbein does not and evidently cannot state is that these fads are based on the authority of medical men who conveniently make discoveries But he finds the American public constipated and gullible
They will accept anything as panacea except right living
They are too busy for that
So the doctor concludes bluntly What fools these mortals be Learn to Play Bridge Well GOOD Bridge players are al ways popular always in de mand at parties always invit ed everywhere

CHAPTER guanamas gratitude
OMING from almost any American in Guanama the statement would have been mildly startling com ing from Edward Hemmett so long the sturdy citizen of the United States it was downright amazing
guess Um not an American any longer
Im an honest togoodness Gua naman for the rest of my days Fernandez his fatherinlaw smiled the plump and placid smile of advanced Argosy middle age and gazed from the terrace of the Edward Hemmett home
Sloping away from the hilltop to the waters edge the capital city of Puerto Carlo lay with its million lights
Beyond stretched the big harbor twinkling in the rays of the moon rich with the little redandgreen spots that meant ships while off on the distant north crescentpoint at the harbors mouth the huge searchlight of the new fort played aimlessly up and down the skies
You have never taken out your THE ARGOSY
citizenship papers here Edward mur mured Fernandez
Not yet
Ill get around to it some day yawned the president of the HemmettGirton Tobacco Company
And renounce your allegiance to the Stars and Stripes eh What Hemmett started little
er suppose so One might do worse Edward Fer nandez laughed gently
Ours is wonderful little country growing more wonderful all the time
In the four years that you have been here see what strides we have made in manufacturing
See what capital has come into Guanama
See what mighty factories have been built to furnish clothes and shoes and shells to the incredible armies of Europe
Another decade Edward and among the great powers will stand Guanama He nodded as he rose
Hemmett smiled indulgently in the velvet darkness
That was one small failing of all Guana mans to feel when new factory or two had been built that Guanama was the worlds industrial center
Nor was Hemmett disposed to argue the point this evening he was lazy with an afterdinner purely Guanaman lazi ness
He wished merely to sit here on the terrace of his beautiful home and reflect upon the almighty goodness of life in general
So that he did not even accompany his native fatherinlaw to the street when that gentleman made for his own ex quisite mansion just across the way he lounged farther back in his chair gazed at his cigar and thought
First and last Guanama had been good to him and to Steve Girton
Guanama had furnished them some of the finest tobaccoland in the world with the biggest profits
Guanama had paid the pair of them an even million dollars for the capture of Dr Manuel Hervira the national menace four years back
Guanama had kept Steve as its perfect secretary of war at very tidy salary and had been wise in so doing
Not to mention his other income from the country good old Steve was like to draw down that annual twentyfive thousand for life
And Guanama had given Hemmett Carmen Fernandez for wife which was best of all
Mr Hemmett then listened to the superb United States piano in his drawingroom and to the laughter of Edward Hemmett Jr aged three and yawned gloriously
North America was all right but South America and Guanama in particular was better
Steve Girton was happy here too al though he had not seen much of Steve lately
Girton to be sure lived right here in the Hemmett home but most of his days were spent at the war office and most of his evenings lately had been spent somewhere else
Mr Hemmett frowned drowsy amuse ment at his own lethargic mental state
Steve had mentioned dining somewhere but where
Not that he was worrying because Stephen Girton was capable of taking care of himself in Guanama or anywhere else
Hemmett stretched his legs and drowsed through another hour to rouse at the sight of Mr Girton him self
Or was Steve himself
Latterly he had been silent and preoccupied now he seemed to vibrate and glow in the dark ness
Latterly he had used many under tones now he shouted You
Wake up Eh cried Mr Hemmett
Its happened
Shes going to marry me
Whos going to marry you Mercedes Girtons voice dropped in something like awe
Mercedes Tesoro
Is that fact Hemmett was wide awake and staring at him
It doesnt seem possible does it It it may be possible Hemmett chuckled
If Carmen was willing to marry me theres no real reason why the next most beautiful girl in Guanama shouldnt marry you suppose but AMERICANS AFTER ALL
say do congratulate you old man
Carmen ll be tickled to death too
She said something about you and Mercedes and paid little or no attention but well by thunder we are Guanamans now in good earnest arent we For the rest of our lives guess muttered Mr Girton with the strange solemnity that had come upon him
Silence followed for little the heavy comfortable silence of two men who understand each other perfectly
Hemmett was thinking pleasantly of the luck that had come to his old friend Girton thrice started humming little native lovesong and thrice caught him self and stopped
And then his own thoughts straying in the direction Hem metts had taken he mused after time It isnt bad place to live our lives all things considered suppose it looks more like heaven to you just now than anything else Hemmett chuckled but its not so bad at that
We had sortie rousing adventures here in the good old days but things are quiet now and forevermore
Guanamas at peace with herself and the world and if they had only reelected Ferrata presi dent everything would be perfect Briefly Stephen Girton left the rose garden of his personal thoughts
How in blazes did they ever elect Altara anyway he demanded
No body ever thought the radical party had lookin everybody assumed that Fer rata could serve for the rest of his life
But they jammed in Altara by hundred votes and hell make rotten presi dent He will that Hemmett agreed
He seems timid abotit his own shadow
His darned inauguration yesterday was rushed through like wedding ceremony in an aldermans office But it was just as legal and binding Girton grinned
lot of those votes for him came down from Carama way where theyve built the uniformmanu facturing city know theydid said Hemmett and lot more came from the Ricoto neighborhood and the new factories there and if it comes down to that the heaviest Altara vote in any one region came from the section of this very town where the employees of the National Engine Works live
That went perfectly solid for Altara And here they stared at each other in gentle astonishment until Girton smiled Do you suppose theres any connection between the two things
Have our va rious new big employers of labor been influencing their employees to vote out Ferrata doubt it Hemmett said slowly
Although this whole industrial boom is rather queer to my mind
Almost any thing queer is likely to come of it
Why just see what is happening here at this minute Steve
Guanamas new factories are furnishing millions of dollars worth of supplies every month to the European armies thatjuld be made more cheaply and bought more cheaply in the United States and carried to Europe more cheaply after theyre made and Say
Thats fact isnt it cried Mr Girton
Well although have never given it much serious thought until the last week or so it is unquestionably fact
Ive been so infernally busy with the tobacco business that Ive never considered the matter until very recently but it is fact that certain European nations are paying more than they need to for the stuff made here
Why Well for that matter why did all the money flow in and why did all the fac tories start up at about the same time
It all began two years ago It all began about the time that certain of our senators decided that Guanama needed big navy and jammed through the proposition in the face of all kinds of opposition Girton spoke sud denly and second by second the languor of recent months left his countenance just as it was leaving Hemmetts
It all began about the time that Canita the THE ARGOSY
confounded pacifist went up in the air and decided that the harbor here needed fort big enough to defend two Panama Canals and jammed it through the sen ate too
In fact the whole business now that think of it seemed to begin at once
long halfminute they gazed at each other through the gloom
Stephen said Hemmett have we been suffering from the native tendency to hookworm of late years
Has some body been putting over something that got by us altogether Ive been wondering that without mentioning it ever since realized that Altara had been elected without reason in the world for electing him And so have Steve more particu larly since the infernal radical party got majority in the senate as well as president
And whats more Oh bosh
Theres nothing to it suppose Girton laughed shortly
Its queer all the same he per sisted
So are all the factories crop ping up so suddenly
So is the National Engine Works with what must be seventy or eighty million dollars worth of capital at least
What is the concern anyway Ostensibly mighty corporation partly native organized for the purpose of turning out the most perfect form of turbine engine
They must mean busi ness Steve
Theyve bought up hundreds of acres out there on the point opposite the fort and paid tremendous prices for the land
Theyre employing thousands of men and Yes and why are they walled off
Why have they fifteenfoot fence about the whole place with guards at every gate
Why is every man in the shops sworn to secrecy Because Hemmett said mildly theyre manufacturing an engine on device that is still dead secret because patents have not yet been issued in several countries
That isnt necessarily criminal even if it is bit odd
But He broke off suddenly for his native butler was at his elbow
messenger senor for the Sefior Girton
He wishes to see Senor Girton himself Send him here that gentleman said briefly
The man departed to return with another native of Guanama some thirty seconds later
The visitor was stranger small and slim and immaculate in his linens he proceeded straight to Girton and smiling and bowing extended an envelope
From the Senor Altara our president senor he purred
If there should be an answer will convey it He backed away while Girton whis tling softly switched on one of the electric lights set in the little tropical fern jar at his elbow
Whistling still he ripped the envelope and drew out the official sheet and be it said that he even continued to whistle as he read and then stopped whistling
exclaimed Stephen Girton
What is it Hemmett asked quickly
Another ten seconds Girton gave to rereading of the document before he looked up angrily
Well it is more or less courteous little note firing the secretary of war he stated
Im bounced CHAPTER II
LANCING through history one finds many secretaries of war who have been disrhissed without undue excite ment for all that we learn to the con trary most of them took it calmly enough but as it chanced Steve Girton had formed for Guanama the only real army that country had ever owned
By hard persistent work he had welded straggling individuals straggling units into as compact little fighting force as the heart could wish
When he appeared on the street people AMERICANS AFTER ALL
cheered the passing of Girtons official automobile periodically the papers had lauded him and resolutions had been passed commending his work invariably his lightest wish had been respected by Guanamas lawmakers and he was human
There is an answer senor asked the messenger
You bet theres an answer the retired secretary of war cried
You tell your ratfaced little president to go to the devil and find some one else wholl give Steve Hemmett cut in sharply
It may not be dignified but Ive ceased to be an official and dont have to be dignified Girton snapped
Im not in love with myself but know what Ive done with this army business
If Id been asked to resign in the usual way Id have called it politics and resigned and charged it up to the justly celebrated ingratitude of republics
But this things simply statement that am dismissed and that my tenure of office comes to an end when Ive read this letter Altara himself wrote that Hem mett cried in amazement
With his own hand
have seen it senor the messenger broke in placidly
Stephen Girton looked him up and down
You go back and tell him that Ive resigned he said bitterly
And if you want to go by the door instead of being kicked over the edge of this terrace go quick
dont like your face and Im mad The little whiteclad man vanished
Hemmett laughed annoyedly
That was childish Steve Maybe so snorted the exsecretary
It wasnt the job itself
We have plenty of money you know that
It was the idea of the thing and the way he did it and the infernal thanklessness of the whole proposition and and its queemess Hemmett nodded
Thats what impressed me first he said
Only yesterday the Novedades had an editorial on the possibility of new cabinet and mentioned the impos sibility of getting secretary of war in Guanama who could even continue your work and Once more he stopped for once more his little butler was approaching
The Senor Enrico Ricoro he an nounced
To see you both senores Together Girton and Hemmett gazed at the butler
The the rich Ricoro the latter asked
The tobacco Ricoro The same senor Send him out here then Hemmett directed and when they were alone again directed puzzled little smile at his old friend
Thats about the queer est thing of the day isnt it this call
supposed that Ricoro was in the deadly enemy class He has been ever since the mess when we tried to merge his tobacco interests with ours Girton muttered
It cant be two weeks ago that he gave out an interview to the effect that the Ricoro combine would never touch Psst Ricoro was with them not the ugly grunting little Guanaman millionaire of the past with every penny of his wealth tied up in tobaccoleaves and his ego swollen to several times its normal size but an oily bowing person who beamed pleasure unutterable
He held out his hands and Girton and Hemmett shook them wonderingly
He drew up another of the wicker chairs and proffered his case of really remarkable cigars
He rubbed his hands happily and lunged into the business of the moment itself an unusual performance in Guana man commercial circles which savor of the Orient in most things
You are astonish that come he chuckled
Pero one makes mistakes yes
have been in some things fool ish
It is to forgive no Consider yourself forgiven Ricoro Hemmett said curiously
Pardon me THE ARGOSY
is this just social call or business visit Both if you will permit since have come to your home senor Ricoro said his engaging smile growing even broader
To sit here on your terrace and survey our city it is wonderful
To speak at the same time of pleasant little business matters that is better yet
No should say that it might depend on the business matters Of certainty chuckled the amia ble gentleman
And these senores think you will find pleasant
come with your permission to buy of you the extensive tobacco interests so ably con ducted by yourselves To buy them For cash senor Ricoro went on smoothly
Why fence senores
You know know that the plantations have cost you perhaps one million and half dollars United States And theyve been paying dandy in terest on two millions said Girton
And for that reason senor come to pay you here and now in cold cash as you say two millions and quarter said the surprising Ricoro
Shall we have the papers drawn this evening and conclude the deal or may call in the morning An explosion of dynamite in the center of the terrace might have startled them little more but very little
This was Ricoro absolutely tobaccopoor as re garded ready cash this was Ricoro who had scorned their own splendid holdings not two years ago
Steve Girton kicked Hemmetts foot in the darkness
Mr Hemmett said simply Nix do not comprehend senor Ricoro inquired
Its nice offer but dont think well accept it
For one thing you are not talking actual spotcash But senor cried Ricoro
Before ten in the morning at the National Bank of Guanama the money shall be handed to you in gold if you wish Aha
And for another thing we dont care to sell
Tobaccoland here is more valuable than ever and when the tariff in the United States has had few more changes its going to be more val uable still The offer is not enough Not nearly Two millions and onehalf said Ricoro
Yes but whats the idea of it Girton rasped
Has somebody found gold on the plantations or is tobacco going to join the highcostofliving performers in some way we dont sus pect
What is it It is simply that having prospered wish to increase my holdings senor After which Ricoro waited silently giving them the vague impression that his feelings had been wounded while Hemmett and Girton conversed in that wordless telepathic fashion that comes now and then to men who have known and understood each other through many long trying years
Ricoro was seeking of course to give the affair the aspect of an ordinary big business proposition
Yet an intelligent tenyearold boy conversant with Gua naman affairs must have known that it was well something else
clairvoyant might have been able to delve into Ricoros brain and find the answer for themselves the certainty re mained that if their holdings were worth two and onehalf millions to Ricoro they held the same value for Hemmett and Girton
Youve sprung it suddenly and at first glance it looks good Ricoro said Hemmett
But were not trust mag nates and were not used to slinging millions around like cigars
Im frank to say that if you offered three millions we should not accept this evening
But when weve had week to think it over But week senor Well
Why not The native drew deep disappointed breath
AMERICANS AFTER ALL
As the excellent senor says why not he echoed
Still had hoped to close this evening
It is handsome offer senor It so darned handsome that it makes one suspicious Girton smiled with utter candor
Theres something so se ductively lovely about it that we wouldnt close if you had truck of gold in the street
Thats because weve lived years in Guanama It is final senor For this evening at any rate But after this evening slipped from the remarkable millionaire as he bounced to his feet and shrugged his shoulders disgustedly and as quickly smiled again
What about this evening Hemmett asked sharply
Why is this evening the particular one to
pay crazy prices for to bacco Ricoro spreading his palms deprecat ingly before them retreated behind his bland smile
It is trick peculiarly Guanaman and bafflingly Chinese
It means anything in the world or nothing at all
In this case it seemed to indicate that both of them were unduly suspicious of an inoffensive millionaire whose sole desire was to make them richer and when the smile had persisted long enough to convince them that Ricoro was done talking business he made few perfunc tory remarks about nothing in particular and took his leave
Down the street they heard the hum of his departing motor
Mr Hemmetts grin was quizzical as he asked What in blazes do you make of it Steve Nothing at all unless some over whelming trust is coming down here to buy in all the tobacco of the country and Ricoro heard of it and borrowed enough to corner the supply before they get here But he couldnt borrow two and half millions in one lump know that mused Mr Girton and by the same token you and know the country very well and doubt if theres one man beside your esteemed fatherjjnlaw able to hand out that sum in cash Through perhaps two minutes they smoked and pondered
Theres something behind that offer Hemmett announced
Something or other that has no immediate connection with the tobacco business Eh Sounds silly but it isnt Steve
Its the result of living so long in Guanama suppose and having thought about that queer election and the other queer things this evening
Theres reason for every thing that happens in this little old world my boy and theres no visible reason for anybody wanting to take over our tobaccoland at fifty or sixty per cent more than its actually worth
Hence the reasons invisible at the moment Steve Girton late secretary of war leaned back in his chair and chuckled little
Hemmett might be bristling with sus picion of an affair he could not quite understand but Girton did not bristle at all
Not one hour back Stephen had become engaged to the most adorable girl in the entire universe and when one is in just that state it is rather hard to bristle at intangible things
think youre all off Ned he said quietly enough
think Ricoro has brainstorm of some kind and believes that Guanama is about to monopolize the earths tobacco market
What he has actually dqife is to form little group of wealthy men make up pool of two millions and half and His voice trailed off
For the third time in few minutes Hemmetts little butler was with them
William Jones he announced this time
Again to see you both senores Jones Hemmett echoed rather loudly
What Jones Hush Girton said quietly
Thats THE ARGOSY
the mystery Jones Ned must be for his names William
Thats the chap who landed last month and has been living on whole floor of the new hotel ever since the fellow that rides around in the big white car he brought here with him Ive heard of him
What on earth does he want of us Why not have him here and find out Girton laughed
Mr Joiiess form appeared in the lighted doorway and moved toward them
Hemmett switched on another light or two and examined Jones as they shook hands
Very well dressed very conventional of feature he might have been anything from prosperous small tradesman to the head of corporation
He seemed to have the faculty of looking like absolutely no definite type and in crowd it occurred to Girton one would have passed him fifty times without knowing he existed
Yet there was queer assured ring to his voice as he said Gentlemen the pleasure of making your acquaintance is very great
bring you news News Hemmett said
News indeed smiled Mr Jones
You both of you are about to leave Guanama
CHAPTER III
JONES PROPOSES
AN the face of the thing the mysterious Mr Jones was mildly demented
That was the one explanation capable of holding water
Fifteen seconds back he had not known them now in the most ridiculously confident fashion he was ushering them out of the Guanama they had done so much to make
What was more having delivered him self he bowed and dropped into chair and laughed quite happily so that yes he was mad fast enough
Did er understand you to say Hemmett began wonderingly
That you were about to leave Gua nama
You did Mr Hemmett Jones laughed
You will leave think on the steamer that sails at one to morrow Just to please you Mr Jones Girton asked amusedly
To please me and because it will be to your considerable advantage said the caller his smile fading
have come with business proposition gentlemen which believe you will find yourselves unable to reject It seems to be quite an evening for business propositions Hemmett mut tered
Jones apparently did not understand nor did he waste time with questions
He smiled polite inquiry at Mr Hem mett for an instant and then leaned forward earnestly
Ive astonished good many people in my time gentlemen and expect to astonish you said he
However it is your own fault
You two gentlemen have piled up quite reputation in the past as engineers and railroad builders and down here youve piled up another as executives of the highest order
That sort of executive as you very well know is beyond price these days back home In the United States referred to it as your home of course Jones pursued with an odd flitting little smile
You have followed big business developments back there take it
But you have naturally
And still said Mr Jones you havent heard of the biggest one of recent years refer to the railroad development Head thrust forward the peculiar gentleman narrowed his eyes and studied them intently for three seconds finally leaning back with contented little sigh
see that you have not he went on
So much the better
Its the blackest kind of secret you know but you two have the name down here of knowing everything in the world and almost feared but thats nonsense of course
AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Mr Girton Mr Hemmett
The greatest railroad system in the United States is about to be built new system going into new territory with new rails and new bridges and new rolling stock with new methods of management and new methods of operating
It will be when finally worked out the greatest single feat in the history of railroading
That is absolutely every detail that can give you at the moment
Not another explanatory word can be spoken until you are established in New York He snapped his fingers quite excitedly
Girton leaned forward
Say what the devil are you talking about he asked
have done talking about the thing itself Jones smiled
have come to the point
We want two men at the head of the construction and we have combed the world for them
believe that have found them
Gentlemen offer you each post with tenyears contract at salary of one hundred thousand dollars annually
Hey Hemmett shouted
The first years salary to be paid to morrow morning and yourselves to sail for New York on tomorrows steamer But we cant But you cant afford to do anything else Jones said suavely
Your duties for three months at least will be essen tially nothing
You will find offices in the city and those in charge will assign you to your own quarters and give you every particular that am forbidden to give
Gentlemen you accept Mr Hemmett cleared his throat with some effort
If we were the brand of gentlemen who can be carried off their feet wed accept he said
Were not
We have considerable property here and am quite certain that it can be disposed of to advantage
would almost guarantee to take care of that And our home is here Hemmett went on irritably
We belong in Gua nama man and Who the dickens are you anyway Well my name is Jones and Im plain citizen employed by big interests the gentleman said simply
My father was an Englishman and my mother Ger man Ive got French grandmother and was born in Kansas City spent part of my boyhood in London and gathered parts of my education and business ex perience in Berlin and Paris
Is that answer enough Its little confusing but it ll do Girton answered dryly
Now tell us the reasons for the secrecy Jones about the railroad That
am simply forbidden to do
Can you start tomorrow The late secretary of war tried to catch the eye of his old friend Jones was between them
It was mighty offer staggering offer
Yet with its glittering gold it twanged so strongly on the string Ricoro had set vibrating that suspicion welled up in Girton
No we cant leave tomorrow Hemmett said sharply
And we cant accept thing about which we know ab solutely nothing or Can you accept it at salary of one hundred and twentyfive thousand What
Why er no
Hemmett stammered
Can you accept it at salary of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars asked Mr Jones
The money to be paid in advance tomorrow morning
Think It was the very thing they were trying to do and difficult thing when one looked at Jones utterly calm utterly commonplace talking like lunatic and still looking as if he meant just what he said
Covertly Edward Hemmett gripped the arms of his chair when he spoke it was something like man speaking in dream
matter of this kind cant be closed in one minute he stated with conviction
Its so overwhelming that THE ARGOSY
sounds er trifle crazy Jones
Well consider it for few days and then Thats just what youll not do Mr Hemmett Jones assured him swiftly
This thing demands an immediate an swer because youre starting tomorrow tell you
Why what ails you man
Dont you understand the figures Im offering
Cant you see that for ten years you
re acquiring the equivalent of another three millions apiece at five per cent
hadnt an idea that youd even hesitate gentlemen far less Well you have an idea now that Im hesitating Hemmett said dizzily
man cant readjust his whole lifq in fifteen seconds just because some one comes around and tries to hand him the national treasury
Well Hemmett cut in Mr Jones offer you two hundred thousand dollars apiece
Thats the limit Im empowered to go and that settles it
Will you be ready to sail Hemmett shut his teeth
Stephen Gir ton did one of the most remarkable things of his lifetime for he stepped forward and tapped Mr Joness arm and looked at Mr Jones much as if that gentleman had sought to pick his pocket
If you want an answer yes or no on the spot the answer is no he said sternly
We will not accept and we will not sail
You may be maniac or you may be trying to hand us something that is simply beyond human understanding at present but that doesnt affect the an swer
The answer is no And now if Mr Jones had astounded them it seemed that Mr Jones himself was astounded
His jaw dropped and his eyes opened incredulously he squint ed at Stephen Girton and his voice dropped
If theres any little deficiency in the mental stuff its yours he said unex pectedly
Once in while man is offered something so good that hes bound to take it blindfolded and thank his stars it came his way
Thats what Im offering you and bosh
Youre not refusing
Oh were refusing fast enough Hemmett contributed
Not definitely perhaps but until weve had time to consider Thats impossible
You accept to night and sail tomorrow or its off Then its off retorted Mr Girton and would haye liked to clasp his brow
Over William Jones came the strangest of changes
Where he had smiled he sneered where he had been amiable and commonplace hard lines appeared sud denly and gave him an indefinable evil threatening aspect where there had been little or no character there was quantity of very unpleasant character
In two seconds the man had become personality and very disturbing one
refuse to believe that thats final said he
It is final said Mr Girton
Youre turning down four hundred thousand dollars year between you rather than make up your minds to pull up Stakes in this Godforsaken spot We seem to be doing just that Its the most unwise thing you ever did Mr Girton Is it It is the new Jones said curtly
Will you be good enough to remember that told you that
Will you phone me if you change your minds before morning
You will
Very well gen tlemen
Good night
And think it over gentlemen
Think it over CHAPTER IV
RIFLE BORING
MRTON at the edge of the terrace watched the white motor coast downhill
Then he turned back to his old friend with confused smile
Just about five minutes more of Mr Jones and theyd have taken me to the new Puerto Carlo asylum said he
Was it real AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Hemmett faced him steadily
Maybe it was the realest thing that has happened to us in Guanama he replied
Whats that Theres something big behind it just as there was something big behind that offer of Ricoros Steve
No one man no one concern is strewing money around in millions like that
Im not exaggerating our own importance but were certain power in this country and Ive been thinking harder in the last two minutes than Ive thought in four years
The object of this evenings little lunatic game is to get us out of Gua nama Do you believe it Mr Girton asked sitting down quite suddenly
believe more than that
Why should those two propositions have been hurled at us that way if they wanted anything else
Any two ordinary men would have fallen for both of em Steve
If we closed with Ricoro and closed with Jones and the money was real wed have nothing to do but retire to New York buy up Central Park and build home in the middle and theres some thing big behind it You said that before And Ill keep on saying it until find the answer Hemmett assured him And heres another point that has been coming up in my mind
The factories the National Engine Works all the money that has come into Guanama in the last two years
Do you realize that almost every penny of it has come from one European nation His eyes snapped
Beneath the tropical tan long since acquired blood was surging up nor did Girton remain un affected
The recent dizziness returned to Mr Girton and he stammered You youve got the darnedest imagination Possibly
But the thing that appeals to me is that in all common sense nation and only nation can spend money like that and the nation that has been spending millions on millions in Guanama Wants us to get out Yes And here since the matter had ascended or descended to the purely ridiculous Girton threw back his head and laughed suddenly
He caught Hem metts frown and laughed the harder
He even slapped his knee and rocked for little and he ended with wheeze
Well its funny notion anyway he remarked
You think theres nothing in it asked the unsmiling Hemmett
have glorious opinion of you and another of myself but refuse to believe that great European nation wants us to move to New York Ned yes Mr Hemmett rose with dry smile
Just the same well step across the street and have guarded little talk with fatherinlaw said he
About all of this Not necessarily
Fernandez is Guanaman with all the national charac teristics
Ive no idea of telling just what has happened and having him form his own theories and chatter about them to every other capitalist he meets for the next month but it does happen once in while that by careful sounding Papa Fernandez can be made to drop helpful little hint or two Steve
Ive had more than one clue to peculiar situation from his lips and come along Silently he led the way across to the magnificent Fernandez home and Ste phens merriment died out within him
For one thing he could find no tenable answer to the double riddle for another Ned Hemmett had disconcerting way of being absolutely right just when one fancied that imagination had carried him away and at the doorway Hemmett was turning to his friend and saying gravely Let me do the talking Steve
If he knows whats afoot hell drop clue They found Fernandez in his library room magnificent as all the others but THE ARGOSY
rather cluttered just now with hunting paraphernalia
This was the season when of late years Fernandez had been taking to the mountains for week in quest of some of the reasonably big game to be found there
highpowered riflebarrel lay across his desk and he smiled at them over it
Ah Edward
The boy in bed he said
Not yet believe
He hadnt come to kiss me good night when left Hem mett said rather lazily
Thats the thirty gun isnt it That is the thirty Edward the one Pedro almost ruined last year
Look through her now He offered the riflebarrel and Hem mett held it to the light and squinted through
Rebored eh
Nice clean job too he said
didnt know youd sent it This afternoon smiled Fernandez
Thats when it came back eh
It takes good while job like that
It cant be done outside the good old State of Connecticut sent it this afternoon and it came back this afternoon Fernandez corrected amazingly
That wasnt rebored in Guanama But of certainty Edward
Is that so astonishing
We have gunsmith in town now Pedro tells me
nice job very nice job He patted the barrel which was well for he could not see the color flowing from Hemmetts cheeks during that minute which followed
Girton was doing some staring of his own too and now with jerk Hemmett was himself again and however brief the call he was moving toward the door
Well just dropped in to see if Carmen had left that second volume of Jean Christophe over here he said in slightly strained voice and remember now that its on my desk
Youre not starting tomorrow The day after Edward
Will you not sit and smoke Not now thanks
Theres er something in that book want to show Steve
Good night Not to the entrance of the house but straight down the corridor to the rear he led Steve Girton and there he clutched his arm and all but hissed Did you get it You think the job was done in regulation gun factory It couldnt have been done anywhere else in the world Steve
Weve got secret gun factory in Puerto Carlo and dandy
And yet ostensibly you can hardly have hammer repaired in this town and this is no crazy secret fac tory of the Guanaman government either because we dont need one
We have nineteen thousand more rifles than we have men and Here you
Is Pedro in the house The darkskinned native maid bobbed her head and hurried off
Mr Hem mett with another of this evenings efforts straightened up and shed some of his outward excitement he had all but accomplished his lazy smile when the dapper little native servant appeared
That gun of Senor Fernandez Pedro Hemmett said
Where did you have it fixed
Ive got one tfcat want rebored The gun senor
But yes came in liquid Spanish
took it to my cousin Agustin Zaro senor who labors in the National Engine Works
He it was who did the work In the National Engine Works Hemmett demanded
Yes senor but as to the other the gun of yourself senor do not know
There was trouble of sort about this one think
gave no heed to the mouthings of Agustin for he has ever been silly fellow senor but there was trouble about his having done the work
Still will inquire senor
For dollar or two perhaps it can be accomplished Well dont dont bother if it is likely to make trouble for your cousin Hemmett answered in husky voice that AMERICANS AFTER ALL
tried hard to be careless
Thats all Pedro
The man glided away
Breathing hard Hemmett led the way back to the terrace of his own beautiful home and now it was no amused Girton that he faced
Was it all imagination Steve Hemmett asked
Is there something afoot in this town and this country that has gone clear over our heads
Does the presence of an arms factory prac tically owned by that European nation mean anything Anything or nothing perhaps but And our new navy Steve Hemmett went on almost wildly as fact after fact rose up before him in the illumination of this startling evening
The new battle cruiser Almiranta out there in the harbor why do they object to people going aboard her
Why is that boat and others of the new boats supposedly bought as secondhand junk so infernally modern as to lines
Why Why is all of it Girton laughed shortly
dont know but do know this its time to have look at the National Engine Works at close range Can we manage it Can any one stop us if we sneak down there at night tonight even the late secretary of war asked
You know Im not exaggerating the thing yet
But if any European nation is establishing base of armament here with the United States just little way north Ned It was too absurd perhaps
He could not say it
The old Monroe Doctrines in fair way to be blown into million pieces finished Hemmett for him thickly
CHAPTER THROUGH THE NIGHT
HERE in the darkness utterly peaceful surrounded by every manifestation of civilization and wealth and placid prosperity Girton and Hem mett stood aghast
Seconds passed be fore Girton was capable of Its not impossible
Guanama owes too much to the United States to sell her out like that
Such thing couldnt be carried on secretly and It has been so far and heres another point look at the way prominent Americans have been getting out lately
Carter had an offer from New York native combine bought out Donaldsons business and he went back to Chicago with the whole force Britt traded his interests for others in Panama and made fifty thousand dollars and Dixons gone and Morton and Fowler And were here Yes were here and Im beginning to think that were not Guanamans
Hemmetts voice thickened suddenly and shook little
Im beginning to think that were Americans after all Steve because the very thought of what this forlorn little hole of country is trying to put over on the United States makes me so damned furious He caught himself but there was an other breathing hard just beside him
Stephen Girton would have spoken sev eral seconds sooner but for the peculiar clogging of his throat
When he did speak it was very quietly Well go and see the National Engine Works now he said grimly
One disadvantage of popularity is that one doesnt wander about without attracting attention
To step from Hemmetts home to the motor would have been simple and conspicuous
They conferred very briefly on this point and made their decision and each of them thrilled little for stealing out in the old khaki taking back streets and back roads to the National Engine Works savored strongly of the good old days before prosperity came when the blood moved fast and ones wits now and then were all that stood between one and the hereafter
Carmen Hemmett fortunately enough for she did not approve of adventure that THE ARGOSY
involved her husband was occupied with callers of her own
The chatter of girls the tinkle of the piano came from the drawingroom when Hemmett shabby in the clothes of their engineering days and with his automatic pistol in his pocket for the first time in months stole down the back stairs to wait for Steve Girton
He had kissed his beloved boy good night and yes be it admitted that Mr Hem mett felt bit odd
He was coming back in an hour or two of course
And really nothing would happen
And now that the first shock had passed he half expected to find that they had been making mountainrange out of an undersized molehill
They would discover that the National Engine Works was harmless and He turned to Girton
Ready he asked
Well go out the back way around Fernandezs and down the alley behind the garages once were down the hill it ll be easy enough to keep in the dark spots Right said Girton whose jaw was set
Its understood that were going into that engine works before we quit think it is March said the retired secretary of war
Side by side closing the door very softly they stepped into the gloom
Side by side they hurried past Fernandezs home with its soft lights and its marble reaches and then downhill into the less opulent quarters of Puerto Carlo
And it was gratifying to note that in their old togs they drew little attention from the casual night prowler they were to all intents adventurous derelicts of the type which drifted into Guanama often enough and drifted out again
Now they had passed the town alto gether and were on the barren stretch destined some day to be an attractive suburb that lay between the outskirts of Puerto Carlo and the bulk of the National Engine Works looming big and black at the end of the wretched dirt road
Four keen eyes peered through the pitchy blackness as they trudged along and could see nothing
Puerto Carlo wasted no electricity in this section but there were weird tales of sentries who shooed the general public from the vast factory shooting before they hailed
The tales were the product of the native mind of course but Halt said voice directly in their path
Its owner had come from nowhere but he was there and with flashlight and rifle
More he seemed puzzled as the light flared into their faces
His voice grew respectful
It is not permitted to pass this point senores We It is not permitted to pass this point senor
have strict orders Unfortunate was it for the unknown that Edward Hemmett had been meditat ing hotly these last minutes upon the trick Guanama seemed about to play on his own United States
There was swish and the flashlight went into the air to shine upon the grass dozen yards away
There was thud and stifled yell and then not sound until Did you knock him out Girton asked interestedly
think so
have him here and hes limp Hemmett announced from the ground
Im tying his hands with the handkerchief from my neck
Jam yours down his beastly throat and make it fast Steve
Thats the talk
Has he belt
Made of rope eh
So much the better
This ll do for his legs It was well for their reputations that no arc lamp shone upon their feat
Three minutes more and an unconscious man was lying with his closed eyes to the stars gagged and bound and the march to the National Engine Works was on again silently as before and little more grim because the stories of exaggerated precau tion had been true and the significance was sinister
AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Their eyes peered the more keenly and their steps grew light and cautious as they came to within bare fifty yards of the towering wooden fence that en closed the works
Behind that fence wideawake men were moving about for the sound of voices came distinctly through the night
Machinery of some sort was running too at considerable distance
And over there was little gateway in the board ing for they could see faint rectangular outline of light and past it back and forth sentry paced
Not that gate for us breathed Hemmett
Well sneak along this way and look for another
wonder if we dare go any closer Well have to Girton whispered
We look over there
Theres another entrance Ned There was at least another outlined rectangle and before this one no figure moved
Reaching it meant stealing along for three hundred feet and then ad vancing directly upon the gate and if the sentry in this case chanced to be beside the gate and alert the expedition had reached its end
Still now that they were within sixty or seventy feet no hail had come
They crouched and moved onward and through the night came gentle snore
Twenty seconds and they were beside the sleeper and he snored on
This sentry at least was typically Guanaman for he slum bered at the post of duty
Hemmetts hand was already upon the knob of the little wooden door
The thing opened freely and before them lay black shadows with the white light of arc lamps on the mighty open space beyond
They had entered the National Engine Works
Beside them loomed wooden build ing faintly illuminated with windows well above their heads
They gazed up at the nearest and with quick nod Hemmett bent forward and braced hands on knees while Girton more after the fashion of an acrobat than retired secretary of war clambered to his broad back and stood erect
He was down again within half minute snarling under his breath
Weve settled the status of the National Engine Works first crack he whispered
Thats the shop where they finish the stocks for army rifles
There must be two thousand of them in sight standing in racks while the varnish dries
Two thousand Look for yourself if you like Ned Ill take your word for it Hemmett muttered
Lets get up to the edge of this wall and see whats to be seen He stole along the wooden side of the building pausing only when another foot would have found him in the white light
Hat in hand he peered cautiously around down the vast yard that seemed to be the center of the establishment
Men were moving about Guanamans for the most part but visibly directed by at least three citizens whose blood held no Latin strain whatever three citizens who despite their white skins were total strangers to man who fancied that he knew by sight all the foreign population of Puerto Carlo
Mr Hemmett drew deep breath
fancy that were getting the whole story in allopathic doses Steve he re ported
That appears to be the main shop over there and theres little door partly open
Can we duck across without being seen Start when the chance seems good Girton said simply
minute dragged along while Hem mett watched the moving figures intently sortie near at hand some far down the big yard
Two minutes went and then three and quite suddenly the soninlaw of Guanamas richest man darted into the light with Girton at his heels darted straight for the shadows of the tre mendous building across the yard and vanished again in the shadows
We got away with it Hemmett breathed as he tiptoed toward the door
THE ARGOSY
We skinned through by one hairs breadth because by the piper that played before Moses he ended in an utterly thunderstruck gasp
Girton was at his side Girton with the effort of his life stifled savage yell because there was cause enough for several yells
Spread before them in the blaze of hundred arclamps stretching hundreds of feet away the big shop lay revealed
Cranes were there of gigantic proportions and from the nearest hung length of steel yards and yards in length with the black circle of its muzzle toward them sixinch rifle
Near the opposite wall an endless line of black circles met their eyes finished unmounted fieldguns of the seventyfive millimeter type
Yet the two giant lathes in the center of the shop claimed all their attention after that first dumfouqding minute one of them was empty the other beyond human question held thing plainly im possible in Guanama fourteeninch gun of the most modern type in process of manufacture
My Lord
My Lord muttered Gir ton
And every darned bit of it must have been landed in sections and at night and it must have taken months to Careful
Whos this whispered his old friend
Is that some one coming around the corner of the building or yes
Duck this way Even now the shadow of the newcomer fell plainly out there in the yard and he was moving swiftly as if to investigate their own particular nook
As one they crouched low and raced toward the far side of the alleged engine works prop erty the side that gave upon the shore of Puerto Carlo harbor
As one they slid to standstill beside another of the little gates in the outer fence and while sentries might be with out that figure behind carried rifle and was still moving in their direction
He seemed uncertain still as to their pres ence
He paused and looked about and with his back turned to them for an instant Edward Hemmett pushed open the gate and stepped forth into the blacker night with Girton at his heels
The gate they closed behind them with out creak
The steps within did not follow to the gate
They were safely out and Halt senor or shoot announced another of the nights black figures thrusting the muzzle of his rifle into Mr Hemmetts ribs
CHAPTER VI
ABOARD THE ALMIRANTA
HE silent excited little laugh which had been upon Hemmetts lips as the gate closed behind them turned to small wheeze
Involuntarily almost he said Dont touch him Steve
Hes got me covered
had no idea of touching him Girton reported breathlessly from point some five yards distant
His colleague has rifle jammed into the pit of my stomach The sentries were talking too both at once each apparently rebuking the other for not obeying orders and shooting down any person who came through the gate in either direction
Brief though the chatter it gave Hem mett and Girton time for some very painful thought
That they were done for seemed beyond question no estab lishment as large as the National Engine Works can keep its nature secret without very energetic measures and doubtless ether investigative minds which had passed this way had ceased to be
It was outrageous of course and in credible but so was the whole plant for that matter
Yes and now the sentries had concluded that orders were orders and the barrel against Hemmetts ribs shook little and the click of cocked hammer came to his ears
Edward Hemmett in perhaps the tenth part of one second gathered himself for AMERICANS AFTER ALL
the lightning drop the lightning tackle of the invisible Guanamans knees and through the gloom came Whats the trouble It was sharp voice yet strangely familiar
Following it another of the pocket flashlights blazed out and amazement came into the voice and note of sharp anxiety Senor Hemmett
And Senor Girton too
You fellow
Drop that rifle
The senores torrent of Spanish assailed him com ing from both sentries
Hemmetts voice shook with relief as he demanded Is that Luis Engoro It is Luis Engoro lieutenant of the Guanaman navy senor the anxious voice reported
But you senores
What are you doing here where none may come
Why Never mind what were doing here get us out of it Girton put in as steps approached from the other side of the wall
This is no time for argument kid
Remember that Hemmett and fed your whole family for six months three years ago Luis
Remember that Hem mett and came across with the cash for the operation that saved your life and But how can forget senor young Engoro cried agonizedly
It is that which wrings my heart because enough
Come quickly He was person of some authority in this accursed neighborhood
The sentries had permitted themselves to be swallowed up in the gloom and Luis Engoro was reaching out toward Hemmett and Gir ton with both hands
They caught the hands and clung to them and Engoro started straight down the steep bank toward the water
Al though it was not so very steep was it
And very broad flight of steps had grown up since their last visit to this particular spot
Above by the gateway flashlights were twinkling at intervals and voices rising in heated Spanish but they did not pause to listen
Engoro knew his way and even now he was leading them along narrow little dock
And now he stopped
Down here senores he whispered
It is the tender of the Almiranta see
shall put you ashore in the city If the tender had owned an engineer he was elsewhere
Engoro himself set the quiet motor to humming as they cast off
Engoro at the wheel turned the little craft out into the harbor and they were safe
It had been rather narrow squeak and not tljat either Girton brow nor Hemmetts was without warm shiny film induced mainly by excitement
But they were safely away from one of the worlds big arms factories and nobody had elected to shoot after them and with every turn of the screw lurid thoughts pounded through two brains that had grown altogether too much accustomed to the peacefully conventional
Week after week month after month they had fairly been sitting atop plot of such magnitude as Guanama had never known before
Where it had started where it might end whither might extend its present ramifications no man could say but that it had corrupted at least one of Guanamas more intelligent youth was proved by Engoro presence at that wheel and his utter silence
Luis Girton said suddenly
Come out with the truth
Do you under stand understand senor but it is impos sible said Engoro thinly
beg of you senor that the the matter be left undiscussed
have saved you And were grateful Luis and that doesnt alter the fact that this is one of the things that cant be left undis cussed Hemmett said firmly
You come out with the truth boy cannot Why not Because even for what have done may pay with my life answered the young man
Should speak freely who can say what will befall me THE ARGOSY
It was an astonishing statement con sidering that he had done no more than save the lives of two lawabiding citizens that he was lieutenant in Guanamas navy and that they were at this minute in government tender but he meant it
He even shuddered and glanced back at them with face that was pale in the light of the tenders lamps
Steve Girton rose abruptly and came to his elbow
Engoro said he Ive always liked you you know that
Weve tried to help you too and Id like to help you out of this
But were going to have the truth from you Luis and while wete on the job you can tell it to us aboard the Almiranta
think that vessel will bear looking over about now But sefior Engoro gasped
That too is impossible Why is it impossible will not lie and cannot explain the young man said doggedly
Then Ill help you out of the predica ment by leaving you no choice kid said the retired secretary of war and the muz zle of his automatic was trained suddenly on Luis
You make straight for the Almiranta take us aboard and show us around the ship and if you feel inclined to do anything else keep on heading for the shore and well blow your thick young head from your shoulders kick the carcass of traitor overboard and go aboard the Almiranta ourselves
What about it The face of Luis Engoro turned to ward him was no less than stricken
The wheel wabbled in his hands and then because Luis was all Guanaman after all he shrugged his shoulders philosophically and accepted the inevitable quite as Girton had expected
The tender veered about and made straight for the bulk of the Almiranta out near the mouth of the harbor
She was not all the visible part of Guanamas navy but she was the most interesting tonight
Whatever she might be it was certain that three more like her were anchored down the coast os tensibly by way of leaving more room in the harbor actually as the Americans suspected more and more strongly to keep them away from interested eyes
There was something too modern about the cut of the
Almiranta to jibe with her alleged status as the castoff of foreign navy and with the low price at which Guanama had bought her
Past the three destroyers they sped in utter silence past the two battleships that had formed the nucleus of the new Guanaman navy and on to the Almi ranta
At her landingstage they came to halt pair of able seamen came down and Girton and Hemmett with Luis Engoro between them hurried to the deck
The lieutenant had not solitary word to say
Nor was much information from him necessary once they were able to inspect the cruiser at close range
She was new
From her deckplates to her fightingmasts she was utterly new
Her engines when they came upon them were of the latest and the fastest and the most powerful type
The strange trio with Luis lagging hurried on to her gunrcoms
It had been announced and accepted as matter of course that the Almiranta had been purchased practically without armament
That would come another year with new appropriations
But when Girton and Hemmett had penetrated to the fighting section of the cruiser they grew breathless for little
She was not unarmed she was indeed overloaded with armament
Mighty batteries some mounted some ready to mount were behind those closed and rusty ports small quickfirers shining through the thick protective grease were there without end and below very deftly arranged so that they could be put into action with scant days notice three torpedotubes modem to the minute were revealed
The Almirantas magazines were not filled they were crammed
Shells of the AMERICANS AFTER ALL
newest type were there tier on tier ready for the ingenious hoists themselves so modern that neither Girton nor Hemmett had ever seen their like before
They had seen too much this last quarterhour to feel great surprise at the sight rather they stood stunned for little as the meaning of it all loomed be fore them
Steve Girton very quietly laid hand on Luiss arm
Look here kid said he you may as well talk little now
Weve seen what we came to see
Youre in it thick arent you Yes senor Are there many more supposedly de cent intelligent boys like you in this navy The pay is high senor Luis mut tered
The other cruisers down the coast are they like this Yes senor Engoro whispered
All three All eleven and the three battle ships Luis corrected
What It is the truth senor and now beg of you let me say no more the lieuten ant pleaded
owed you much seriores
have paid this evening
But before others come to ask about why took you from the shore will you not leave senores
To me it means life or death and there is no more to see
Upon that give you my word Ill Ill ask you one more question and well skip Girton ran his fingers through his hair and blinked confusedly and for the second time that night won dered if reality actually could be reality
Youre too bright to be in this thing blindly Luis
You know and we know that for the first time in history European power has established naval base on the American side of the world and big one
How in Heavens name it has been kept under cover for so long passes my understanding they must have bought Guanama body and soup But what want to ask you is this Are there more ships of this kind coming It has been said senor Engoro mut tered
And if enough of them get here to handle the job it is intended to attack the United States Girton pursued
It it has been said senor that that coercion that oh go senor Engoro floundered wildly
For it has been sworn that death shall be the portion of one of us who He could get no further
Girton teeth grinding gazed speculatively down at his automatic pistol
Hemmett white again and with hands twitching came close to Engoro
You nasty little brown rat he said
Id rather be dead than be in your shoes
You cant understand that can you
You cant understand what the United States has done for this country for you first and last can you
You dont know what gratitude is you dont know what decency even means but you do know how to sneak up on sleeping man or sleeping nation and drive in knife if you are paid eh
Id like to kick the life out of your filthy pelt but Id have to kick the life out of half of Guanama afterward to be consistent suppose
Well go Engoro and in very little time the United States will send forces down here to spoil the whole game and when that happens youll get yours
And if can have the job of punishing you assigned to me Ill truss you up to one of your pretty basketwork masts and leave you there till the birds pick your bones
Thank you for saving our lives Engoro and be damned to you
Come Steve CHAPTER VII
THE ALARM
LONE sailorman set into motion by Engoro whose legs bade fair to collapse beneath him ran them back to shore trembled incessantly as he peered THE ARGOSY about the deserted pier of the yacht club and then whirling about rowed off through the night as if the powers of evil were after the boat
It was early morning now as the two Americans tramped silently uphill to the Hemmett home silently because Puerto Carlo is largely ears even in the small hours and because each man was think ing more astonishing thoughts than the normal brain could conveniently handle
Only as they came to the terrace of the still dark house did Girton say softly Just what is going to be the speediest way of getting busy Ned Well sleep on it till morning Hem mett answered
Then well get Barton the more or less gifted American minister up here lay the truth before him and have report in Washington before noon
After that its up to the United States and while that has lately been darned sight more complacent nation than it used to be in our time still have suspicion that there will be something doing The nations all right it needs wak ing up thats all Girton said
And think this ll do it and whether it does it or not Id rather be an American hod carrier than the president of this dirty traitorous little hole
When think That youre engaged to Guanaman girl and Im married to another Hemmett laughed queerly
hadnt thought of that the retired secretary said rather blankly
Well had and theyre no more to blame for the doings of the politi cians here than the folks back home and we wont discuss the thing over the breakfasttable by the way Daylight came before sleep reached either man
Their personal world had turned upside down since eight oclock or thereabouts last evening
Mentally and to some extent physically they had been settling down these last years to Guanama and all that Guanama implied
They had been content and prosperous and too busy with routine work to give great heed to possible plottings indeed while neither of them had harbored the concrete thought perhaps they had be lieved that plotting and Guanama once so intimately associated were divorced for all time
Ferrata was president and due for reelection like the bulk of the lawmakers Guanama was hive of industry and all was well
And now Ferrata and his party had been ousted and sinister influences long at work beneath the surface were coming into full view with some of the manifesta tions focusing upon themselves
There could be no question that the hidden powers were more than merely anxious to see the last of them
Ricoro tool or conspirator had proved it con clusively could they have but read the true significance of his offer at the time of its making
Jones the incredible had proved it and both had proved that the giant fester was coming to head
Morning as rule found both men very clearbrained but not this morning
The whole thing was too overwhelming too grotesque for assimilation even now
Girton before breakfast went with his highpowered binoculars to the terrace and looked over the National Engine Works and the Almiranta as if to assure himself that they really existed
Rust was the thing mainly visible on such of the cruiser as might be seen from Puerto Carlo
Piles of packingcases tiers of harmless lumber were all the glasses showed of the works beside roofs and walls
Carmen it appeared wished to ride with the boy to an aunt in the uphill suburbs for the morning and her hus band assented with readiness that caused her to stare for moment
She went nevertheless and before the motor was out of sight Hemmett had John Barton the American minister on the telephone and was fairly ordering him to report at the Hemmett home
It was up to Barton alone of course and they wished sincerely that he might have been gentleman of different stamp
They looked him over as he came in AMERICANS AFTER ALL
plump commonplace man not very in telligent not very well educated political growth who had been power in his own section and for whom some provision had to be made
The post at Guanama is not quite in the class of the Court of St James and its incumbents are sometimes correspondingly below what might be desired
Still Barton was the whole visible supply of United States authority and when they had locked the library door and arranged things so that no interested listener could well come within range without attracting attention they told their tale
John Barton listened puffing out an exclamation here and there removing his glasses and polishing them at regular in tervals scowling incredulously at Hem mett and then at Stephen Girton until finally they came to the end and with dubious glance at each other impatiently awaited his views upon the astounding situation
They came when he had stared per plexedly across the room for long minute
think gentlemen that you exag gerate he said heavily
Does that does that mean that you dont believe what weve told you Girton demanded
should hesitate to put it in just that way the American minister smiled tartly
think gentlemen pardon me Im sure
that you have seen some of these things and fancied the rest
The United States as you are perfectly well aware is on good terms with the entire world So good as to make it impossible that any European nation should have decided to take chance on coming over picking fight and recapturing some of the un believable gold supply that has flowed into America of late years Hemmett cried
Barton laughed aloud and wearily
Oh but my dear sir he protested
Hasnt that bugaboo been laid to rest
thought sir that the yellow journals themselves had wearied of harping on that absurd idea But And for another thing Mr Hem mett the minister pursued testily operations of such magnitude as you suggest are perfectly impossible secret ly at any rate
To me the idea that gigantic naval base is forming in Gua nama is simply grotesque Well in spite of what does or does not strike you as grotesque you can go straight to the president of this republic and demand permission to inspect the National Engine Works cant you Girton asked hotly
can assuredly
And shall not render my office ridiculous by doing any thing of the kind Mr Girton
shall er report to Washington all that you have told me not giving the statements as proven facts but as hearsay sir And you will not even verify will do what have said sir and if my government wishes me to move further in the matter instructions to that effect will be forwarded to me as you know
Pah Mr Girton
Dont glower like that
know you will know when both of you are little calmer that the whole thing is false alarm
Granted that there is gun factory out there gentle men
What more natural than that the Guanaman government itself for reasons doubtless good and sufficient has decided to manufacture its own war munitions
And your nightmare cruiser and the fleet that is suposed to be somewhere down the coast
The reason for them stands on the very face of your recital
These Guanamans raise the very dickens at the idea of their precious taxes being spent for anything but plazas and public bullrings and band concerts as you very well know
Unquestionably the government is forming an efficient navy and very wisely keeping from the public the amounts spent THE ARGOSY
Then you think Engoros fake too think sir from your account that he was drunk Barton snapped
And please do not force me to say gentlemen that almost suspect er ahem We wont because if you happened to say it it might be necessary to take good grip on the scruff of your neck Hemmett informed him
And let me say this Barton believe what you like or believe nothing at all am going to take it upon myself to report to Wash ington direct that Here he stopped because the knocking on the door had become insistent
Girton answered it and came face to face with the little butler and behind the little butler stood Dr Cortera himself perhaps the biggest medical man in Guanama and their very good and very old friend
Pardon me for popping in like this Dr Cortera said quickly in his easy English
Its important the thing that brought me here
It concerns the United States and oh didnt see you Mr Barton Girton was locking the door again
Hemmett rose to his feet
What con cerns the United States Well deathbed confession old man Cortera answered after little hesitation
had rather intended tell ing you about it first and then going down with you to Mr Bartons office if you saw fit Go on
Cortera glanced keenly from one to the other then smiled grimly at Barton with his bored cynical eyes
It was Captain Zarata he said
Peritonitis got him after all and he well he wanted to talk to me alone be fore he slipped away and he did
He was commander of one of the battleships before disease got him and he had good deal on his mind that needed con fessing
Gentlemen Dr Cortera announced impressively Guanama has been bought up by nation across the Atlantic
Guanama from one end of the coast to the other reeks with plot of such size as has rarely entered history
And to the best of my information and belief that nation is making Gua nama base of supplies and when the base is all ready the said nation is going to hand terrible wallop to unprepared America
CHAPTER VIII
WILLIAM JONES AGAIN
DWARD HEMMETT and the retired secretary of war turned as one and looked at the American minister
Barton had been startled out of his stodgy calm at any rate he was holding the arms of his wicker chair and leaning forward scowling at Dr Cortera and blinking fast
The doctor for his part gazed mild astonishment at Hemmett and Girton
Nothing ever surprises you does it he asked
This doesnt because we knew all about it last night Girton said with faint smile
Leave us out of it Cortera and convince Barton that it is the truth
Weve told him once and he implied that we were drunk Hey Cortera exclaimed
er implied nothing of the sort said the American minister
was incredulous frankly incredulous and am still incredulous
This captain doc tor
Was he in his right mind
Could he not have been speaking in the delirium which Zaratas mind was as clear as bell up to his very last breath Guanamas leading physician said incisively
Dont fool yourself at all on that count Mr Barton
Zarata knew exactly what he was talking about and it weighed heavily on his conscience the existence of which take it he discovered about fifteen minutes after he learned that he was at deaths door
He felt that Guanama was playing AMERICANS AFTER ALL
the United States pretty lowdown trick and he wanted to feel that he was doing what he could to undo the work
If the poor devil had lasted another hour Id have had information enough to stand our unfortunate little country up oh edge
He didnt
He had given me the main facts and had informed me that the best part of the navy and threefourths of the poli ticians had been corrupted with large sums of real money and he was just about to give me some names when he was called to the other world
But its all true and it all fits in with dozen things Ive been observing this last week or two
The whole country is honeycombed with bribery the new navy isnt Guanamas at all
And the National Engine Works out there on the point gentlemen is Yes Ive heard about that Ive heard about that Barton said rising with growing agitation
shall act of course
shall act at once How Girton asked crisply
By reporting every detail to Wash ington in code immediately and signifying that the matter is urgent and needs instant action the American minister pursued with commendable force as he moved toward the door
was er wrong Mr Girton in doubting your statements apparently
Even now cannot quite believe but will act at once He departed quickly
Cortera shrugged his shoulders
wish could have kept the poor wretch this side of the Styx for another hour or two he said
Doesnt it beat the devil what any one with money can put across in Guanama
Ten dollars and our plain citizen will swear himself to eternal secrecy fifty and hell murder his own brother hundred and hell hand you mortgage on his eternal soul
Sometimes think the whole lower class here are like lot of defective children and Well the cure for that sort of defectiveness is spanking Hemmett snapped with excusable savagery
You are not going There is gentleman down at the hospital who is expecting me said Cor tera
He must be under the ether by this time but had to drop in and tell you first
You yourselves what are you going to do about it
Youre not the kind to sit passively and watch this kind of muddle Were going to do whatever we can do replied Girton
If Barton has waked up and rouses Washington per haps well have nothing to do
Goodby old man and thanks Cortera too hurried away
For little time Hemmett and Girton sat and threshed the matter out to the general end that there was really nothing to do until word had come from Washington
They were apparently beginning the circle again when the telephone bell rang violently
Barton said the voice at the other end
Is that you Mr Girton
It is
Do you know man named Jones sir William Jones Eh
Ive met him yes Who is he give it up
Why Jones sir said the American min ister and his voice trembled Jones came into this office Mr Girton sat on the edge of my desk laughed in my face sir and ordered me ordered me Mr Girton
to send no report whatever to Washington And told him to go to blazes sir and he laughed again and and threatened me
He informed me in so many words Mr Girton that my personal welfare would be promoted by keeping complete silence And Then helfiew some smoke in my face sir and left
thought it best to advise you
Im preparing my report at this minute Go to it old man chuckled the re THE ARGOSY
tired minister as he hung up
Little Bill Jones is on the job again Ned And somebody else is here for us stated Hemmett as he hurried to the door and unlocked it and then started back for hat on the back of his head cigar in the corner of his mouth inso lent smile on his lips William Jones stood there all unannounced
Pardon my arriving this way he said easily as he entered
The door was open and didnt want to lose any time in getting to you gentlemen
What with one thing and another this promises to be rather busy day and wanted to have my little chat with you early Well Ill be Girton began
Dont be profane at any rate Jones smiled
just dropped in you know to get your final answer
Ive communicated with my folks overnight and Im able to offer little added in ducement
They tell me that they still feel that youre the men for the jobs and that if theres no other way of budging you may offer you each fifty thou sand dollars bonus if youre willing to sail at one oclock
Well You said the retired secretary are the sneaking slithering agent of railroad Jones put in quickly
Never lose sight of that railroad
And since you seem to be in truculent mood this morning Ill come right down to cases and cut out the pretty stuff
You two are going out of this country on the one oclock steamer with your people and with your pockets full of money or youre going to be pair of idiots and stay here and take the con sequences
Get that There was pause in every sense dra matic
Girton doubled his fists and took step forward
Hemmett laid hand on his arm
Just minute Steve he said
He wants to cut out the pretty stuff and well help him
We have to take the consequences do we Jones You certainly do
And dont be an ass Hemmett
Just Well the first consequences well take is you stated Hemmett as he gripped the gentlemans two arms
Frisk him Steve
Hell be carrying at least oqe gun And then he chuckled as Jones with tremendous heave sought to wrench himself loose and failed completely and he chuckled again as Steve Girton drew from Mr Joness pockets pair of auto matic pistols that might have held off mob
Were getting right down to cases arent we Jones he asked
Well go little farther
Open that door Steve
And you if you wiggle Mr Jones youll get just one whack on the vulnerable spot behind the ear and after that well have to carry you Jones glanced at him over his shoulder
He was cool again and sneering
You poor clod he said pleasantly
Havent you brains enough to know that youre piling up trouble for yourself by this idiotic trick have not
March Where to Girton asked
Out back to my nice new stone garage said Hemmett
That has good look on the outside
Well let Jones cool off for while and then decide whats coming to him He was curious citizen
Instead of resisting he stepped along jauntily ac cepting the situation as if it had not been just what he expected
He smiled too he seemed to be laughing somewhere inside and now the door of the garage was open with only the runabout in sight and Hemmett sent the gentleman within and slammed the door
Just why did we do that Girton inquired when they were again in the library
wanted to put him where hed be accessible when weve had chance to consider his case Hemmett explained with half smile
Upon my word Steve that cuss with his assurance and his billiondollar talk makes me feel queer
Hes at the bottom of the whole AMERICANS AFTER ALL
thing and its all so big that havent quite comprehended it even yet
That man is the most dangerous enemy the United States has in all Guanama Leaning back in his favorite chair gnawing his cigar he gave five minutes to
contemplation of the bookshelves eventually to sit erect and shrug his shoulders with Third degree guess What It isnt nice of course but dont know that Jones demands any consider ation Steve
He has the eye of physical coward too and somehow after weve hammered him around that garage for little believe hell be in shape to confess all he knows And then Then we lock him up in the garage again my boy and send new report to Washington
Oh its bizarre and un lawful and all that sort of thing understand that much perfectly
But were Americans after all Steve and for the sake of the United States think its the proper caper smiled Mr Hemmett and gazed affectionately at his own brawny fist
Come along old man Be it admitted that Stephen Girton did not seek to stay him with protests
Stephen flexed his own hands and sighed lightly and thus they advanced upon the illstarred William Jones all unaware of the elemental forces he had unleashed and which were about to alter his physical appearance and perhaps his mental state as well
When this door opens said Mr Hemmett as he slipped the key into the lock he is due to make dive straight out that way
Stand there Steve and grab him Mr Girton bent forward alertly
The door slid back and Mr Girtons pose was unaltered
Nor after several sec onds had he gripped Mr Jones
And now the door was wide open and the whJe interior of the garage was visible even to the seat of the runabout and while the garage held pretty little American car and several kinds of grease and workbench and tools and rack for the light robes it gave no indication whatever that William Jones existed on earth
CHAPTER IX
THE VANISHED JONES
IT occurred to Hemmett that William Jones was hiding in the runabout ready to make dash for freedom
He crouched therefore and covered the two yards with queer little spring he reached over the dashboard with both hands and clutched quantity of Gua naman air
He isnt there could have told you that Ive been able to look across the car since stood outside Girton said somewhat faintly
But we but we locked him up here Hemmett stammered
We certainly did and just as certain ly he is not locked up here now Ned the retired secretary agreed
Dont stand there with your mouth open like that
Ramon is watching you from the house Well if Ramon has his eye this way perhaps Mr Hemmett began
The butler was approaching his small dark countenance lined with perturbation
He came to the garage itself and bobbed his head respectfully
There is something wrong he asked
He was after all not the chauf feur of the sefior What Ay de mi
The fault is mine the butler confessed emotionally
He came but to steal yet because of his splendid clothing have thought that he was as he said the new chauffeur of the sefior What did he do Ramon Hem mett asked with some difficulty
He did but come to the kitchen sefior and ask most courteously for the key to the garage five minutes back
He said that Sanchez because of his inso THE ARGOSY
lence had been dismissed and that he had been engaged
He requested the key that he might secure the can of heavy grease and he returned the key within one minute senor
Yet see
Because the fault is mine let what he has stolen be taken from my wage senor for see Oh shut up Hemmett said wearily
The escape could have been little simpler perhaps had William Jones paused to remove the garage lock and drop it into his pocket as he entered
William Joness own man had had his instructions and had executed them with neatness and despatch it seemed almost as if William Jones had expected to find himself locked in the garage and issued orders accordingly ahead of time
But whether that was the case or the man had simply been waiting had seen his employer imprisoned and had taken the quickest means of getting him out again Jones was gone
And the point of it is just this Hemmett said bitterly as he picked up his telephone in the library Jones got loose because he or his man acted quick Steve
That seems to be the key note of all his performances to move like lightning and hang trying to conceal anything
Why all that socalled engine works property was bought in the open and nobody thought anything of it
And the Guanama navy bills were jammed through the senate in the open and no body thought any thing of it
And now his agent walks straight into my kitchen and demands the garage key and gets it because Ramon couldnt see anything un usual in the stunt and Give me police headquarters Hemmett wound up dis gustedly
He waited tapping his foot and pur posely avoiding the rather sheepish smile which came to Girtons face as he pon dered the latest flitting of Jones
He snapped Headquarters
Give me Domez the chief of detectives
This is Mr Hemmett Ah
The pleasure senor to serve one so august floated over the wire
Cut the joy stuff retorted Hem mett
Domez theres man in town named William Jones man who has the whole third floor of the new hotel and drives around town in white auto mobile
You know him eh
Well fti glad of it
Catch him and bring him to me But but the charge Domez stam mered
Ill attend to the charge and Ill protect you if he makes trouble said the American
Dont worry about that part of it
Get him But it is told senor that the Senor Jones is man of great wealth and in fluence the chief replied dubiously
It is related So am man of great wealth and influence barked Mr Hemmett bitter ly
had enough of both to get you your present job Domez and Ive enough of both left to take it away from you
Not that Im asking you to do anything crooked you understand
If you round up Jones Guanama ll be handing you medals year from now
But get him If it be possible senor Domez agreed somewhat faintly and hung up
It was the last that caused Hemmett to curse aloud for like many other re cent happening that trick of hanging up the receiver was almost beyond belief
Domez these many years had been the soul of respect not to say adoration
Domez at the slightest word of either Girton or Hemmett had been in the habit of leaping at the task of the moment and now without string of compliments and assurances without so much as an apology Domez had cut off the conversation
If it didnt seem so confounded silly Id say that Domez himself was in Joness pay Mr Hemmett announced
Followed the daylong lull
They were at liberty if they chose to tear about town in search of Jones themselves
They were at liberty to go AMERICANS AFTER ALL to the new President of Guanama and state the case and demand action they did neither
For one thing the latter job was Bar tons exclusively for another the visit was like to prove sheer waste of time
Deeper than any other man in Guanama perhaps in this gigantic plot would be Jose Altara president of the country
There had been much talk of fraud just after his election and curiously enough it had been only talk
The papers with unanimity never before in evidence had assured all Guanama that not sin gle doubtful vote for Altara had been cast and the light of recent events was shining strongly on those papers this morning as Hemmett and Girton dis cussed the situation
It might seem farfetched yet either would have been willing to bet portion of his wealth that not newspaper in the country was actually owned by Gua naman now
Carmen and the boy returned for luncheon and it was rather silent meal the air surcharged with suspense the lovely young Mrs Hemmett asking questions with her eyes but not with her tongue the boy prattling with the cheer ful irresponsibility of the threeyearold and for the first time since last evening drawing Hemmetts attention from the crisis in Guanamas affairs and those of the United States
He was wonderful kid that Edward Jr
Hemmett still affirmed the fact to Stephen Girton not less than four times daily
He had the brainpower of savant he made remarks which for sheer wit and wisdom probably excelled any other remarks since children have been
Toward three they wandered down to the American minister and found him in distressed state
Barton had reported to Washington and was still awaiting reply
He had also in fit of energy gone straight to Altara and according to his own account confronted him flatly and ferociously with Guanamas treachery
The upshot of the interview had been apparently that Altara had exclaimed in amazement had denied all knowledge of anything of the kind had assured the representative of the great United States that an instant investigation should be set afoot and the plotters shot as soon as they might be captured and in the next breath had informed Barton unquali fiedly that none would be found because none existed
Following this Altara had slapped his chest and delivered short oration as to the eternal fidelity of Guanama to America and when he left even John Barton had understood that Guanamas president was lying at high speed
Evening was drawing near and still no reply had come
Hemmett and Gir ton having tired of watching Barton bite his nails of hearing him call up the cable office to learn that no official message was on the wire eventually walked back to their home
They were in for quiet night appar ently perhaps they were in for quiet sue months or year
Outwardly the international affairs of the United States were calm and pleasant and trouble of this kind cannot be forced in minute
Then too the eventual staggering move would mean troops doubtless to be moved as quietly as possible from Europe to Guanama and thence north when the time came
True they might mean to move di rectly across the Atlantic but it was all little way in the future
Having readjusted their minds to the trouble that was brewing Hemmett and Girton were almost themselves again as they climbed the white steps to the Hemmett home
And then leaving the state where it involved millions of human beings the mystery centered suddenly on the house itself
Hemmett was even laughing when shrill cry came from the direction of the garage lately the prison of William Jones
He brought up short he turned THE ARGOSY
to Girton and found the latter suddenly white
Was that the kid he gasped
Thats the kid and hes hurt Gir ton replied leaping to the side of the house and the runway to the garage stopping short then as Hemmett slid to his side
Look He pointed with his left hand fum bling wildly for his pistol with the right
He had left it upstairs that morning and he ceased fumbling and collided with the house itself as Hemmett dashed past
For the boy was there in the arms of lithe little Guanaman who had paused misguidedly to try thrusting cloth into the childs mouth
Wild with terror Edward Jr was beating at him with both little pink fists turning his curly head from side to side kicking and again managing to scream for help
And now in the second or so that fol lowed the scream his captor was turning to the father and looking straight into his eyes and since all Guanama knew of Hemmetts pistolaim since the automatic in Hemmetts hand was descending swiftly to shooting position he would drop the boy and seek to save his own life or no he had no intention of drop ping the boy after all
With tiger bound he made for the side of the garage and the boy was held high between his own body and Hemmett
And his heart must lie squarely be tween the pinksocked legs he clutched
Edward Hemmett turned to frozen steel fired and closed his eyes
CHAPTER JONES WORKS ON
CENTURY dragged along and still Hemmett could not force his eyes to look
Once upon time he would have wagered an even hundred dollars against nickel on his chances of hitting penny at that range now for two years at least he had fired hardly shot
And if he had missed the mark this time new scream of fright opened his eyes
He drew breath with gasp and dashed forward and already Girton had the boy in his arms and was soothing him and asking him if he was hurt and feeling over the round little body
You you didnt touch him thank God he quavered
Are you sure
Are you sure
Steve give him to me Hemmett mouthed frantically as he snatched the boy
Dad didnt hit you
Does it hurt anywhere sonny
Are you sure it doesnt Neddy
Are you sure
Tell dad Another shriller scream was coming from the house Carmen this time Hem mett gripped himself and held the boy little tighter
Your Guanaman girl has hardly conquered hysteria as yet al though Carmen held remarkable self control for one of her blood his own calm was very essential just now and he even contrived to smile as his beautiful wife sped to his side
Its all right little girl he said
Its all right
The kid isnt hurt Give him to me
Give him to me cried the mother as die turned shudder ingly from the sight just beyond
That man that oh And now the younger Edward Hem mett was in her arms and she sobbed over him while Girton rose to his feet after very brief conclusive inspection of the mistaken individual who had turned abductor
This was hH farewell appearance as kidnaper he said grimly
Hes stone dead
And better that he had died by tor ture Carmen cried surprisingly
For he sought to steal my baby and There there her husband put in himself decidedly whiter
Whatever it was it is all over now child
Take the boy in and get out of this yourself Carmen And you for killing him what will they do to you They wont do much of anything to AMERICANS AFTER ALL
me my dear Hemmett said grimly
Well have to leave him here for the police Steve
Tell Ramon to cover him He led the way into the house and Girton followed also decidedly jarred
Mr Hemmett having seen his family on the way upstairs returned to the tele phone and demanded speech with the chief of detectives
Thats you is it Domez he in quired
Well this is Mr Hemmett once more
Domez man just tried to kidnap my boy and shot him dead
want his body out of here inside of fifteen minutes and after that Im at your ser vice whenever you need me
No understand that youll make things simple for me if have witnesses and Ive got em
And another thing Domez
dont think as much of you or this country as did twentyfour hours ago and want to tell you candidly that if any one else tries anything of this kind on me Im going to hold you personally to account
Yes that means just what it says He pushed away the instrument with little shudder and rose
Ill go and see how Carmens getting on Steve he said
You attend to the matter out there It had been attended to before Hem mett returned oddly attended to for that matter
The motor patrolwagon bellmuffled had whisked around from the hill police station and directly up the drive to the garage with scant ceremony the misguided Guanaman had been loaded aboard
After that the suave officer who accompanied the vehicle took Stephen Girton aside and much as if favor had been done to the force itself and to himself in particular smilingly informed him that since no attention had been attracted from the street the matter might be considered closed
It was very very puzzling
In Gua nama when shooting has taken place little police officials are wont to swarm over the entire landscape waving hands taking notes and photographs question ing everybody summoning everybody threatening everybody and assuring everybody that the criminal will not only be found but also drawn and quartered
This unfortunate affair twenty minutes after the shot might never have hap pened
So Stephen Girton informed his friend when he reappeared frowning
Im sorry Hemmett muttered
It gives me the shakes to think about it but what else was there to do
The first thing that flashed on me was that this was more of Joness work Steve that he was taking the boy to hold for ransom and shot
And the way the police have acted bears it out too Perhaps perhaps not
Im more inclined to think that the man was operating on his own hook and His teeth clicked together he listened attentively
There was disturbance outside and the chattering of Ramons excited tenor and now steps came toward the room and Barton wildeyed hatless burst in upon them
Gentlemen he cried
The the devil is in this town
The my wife gentlemen Whats happened Girton asked quickly
Barton tottered into chair
Abducted he choked
She she is gone Gone where Great God man
Do you suppose Id be sitting here if knew that the American minister cried
She went for ride with her friend Mrs Halliday you know the woman
They stopped at one of the big shops downtown Tremi nos believe and Mrs Halliday went in to get something
She was just coming out when when it happened The shooting was quite forgotten
Girton on one side Hemmett on the other they came close to Barton as the latter choked on It it would seem Mrs Halliday was greatly excited it would seem that THE ARGOSY
another automobile drove up beside the one in which Mrs Barton sat gentlemen
Everything must have been prearranged for she says that three men stepped out at once and into the Halliday car
They threw blanket or something of the sort over Mrs Barton and lifted her bodily into their own machine and it was speeding away before any one could raise hand The retired secretary looked at his friend
Barton gazed wildly from one to the other
What shall do gentlemen he cried
Dont stand there like that
My wife
Dont you understand my wife We understand perfectly Barton Hemmett said quietly
My boy all but got th same dose
was lucky enough to shoot the fellow who had him
Has anything of the sort been threatened No nor dreamed of Have you been having trouble with any one Barton Mr Hemmett am positive that havent made an enemy since came to this hellhole Nor Mrs Barton Why Marthas positively afraid of the native element
Barton cried
Well have to charge it up to Jones think You believe that the man is so ut terly abandoned as to attack women and children Barton gasped and it was noteworthy that his faith in Hemmetts estimate of the Jones character seemed to have increased since their last meeting
Im not quite sure what think Hemmett confessed
Theyre coming little too fast for me but here
Give me that telephone
Police headquarters again He waited impatiently until the click came from the other end of the line then Domez
Yes its Hemmett again
Domez have you found Jones yet Senor in all Puerto Carlo there is no trace of the Senor Jones the chief of detectives informed him smoothly
Thats lie and think you know it
Listen Domez
The wife of the American minister has been kidnaped
Yes you may well gasp
Well dont know how youre going to find her but do know that if you dont find her youll have an American fleet shelling Puerto Carlo inside of week
Well Domez well put it in another way then
If you havent returned that lady to her home before midnight youll reckon with me and the same gun that killed the fellow who tried to get my boy
Think it over This time it was Mr Hemmett who hung up the receiver unexpectedly but there was no anger in his face as he turned back to them
Instead the slight pallor had returned and Hemmetts eyes were undeniably round
cant make it out he said
Unless Domez himself is in the very thick of the thing cant make it out
By all precedents he ought to have howled and protested when talked to him that way and instead he had the cold nerve to tell me that if the American fleet turned up looking for trouble it was likely to get all it came after Fact cried Girton
Almost word for word But my wife gentlemen gasped the agonized Barton
What of her
What did he say
What shall we do Hemmetts shoulders squared as he considered the unfortunate gentleman his round face fishwhite and wet with perspiration his collar wilted and his hands twitching incessantly
He said that he would start men out at once of course he replied quietly
That may mean everything or nothing
As to what well do Barton well get out and start the grand hunt for Mrs Barton ourselves
And want to tell you that so far this country hasnt succeeded in putting over anything on Girton and me
When we start for Mrs Barton well bring her back in good shape or well have half this town shot to flinders
AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Ill tell Mrs Hemmett that shes going over to her fathers with the boy
Fernandez is alert enough when hes roused to danger he can shoot straight and there are at least two men servants over there who can be trusted implicitly which is rare in this town just now
Ill be down in about five minutes and well start Breathing hard he climbed the stairs to the quiet upper floor
Now and then even in Guanama things grow too utterly outrageous and this was surely one of the times
That the younger Edward Hemmett had all but fallen victim to the abductor was bad enough but at least that stunt had bfeen nipped in the bud
When it came to abducting the middleaged wife of the middleaged and ostensibly impor tant American minister however in the open business street yes that was carrying the thing altogether too far
Mr Hemmett paused at his room to slip fresh box of cartridges into his pocket paused at Girtons room to secure that gentlemans automatic and then entered his wifes bedroom
Carmens maid sat there half asleep as usual while the boy little paler but even now settled down to picturebook sat on the floor beside her
The senora Hemmett said briefly
In the boudoir senor The senoras husband scowled about the room
Hasnt she finished dressing for dinner Not yet senor
She is but half dressed the maid droned
She stepped into the boudoir for her diamond comb think
She is still there Still eh
How long has she been there These fifteen minutes senor the maid informed him placidly
Mr Hemmett crossed to the closed door and tapped it briskly
There was no response
He tapped again
Still no sound came from beyond the portal
Carmen called Hemmett
Only silence answered him
And his skin crawled suddenly he could feel his hair rising
Not of course that anything could have happened to Carmen up stairs in her own home but Carmens husband opened the door suddenly and stepped into the boudoir
It was empty
Over there broken chair lay in three pieces upon the floor and over there was one of Carmens huge cutglass toilet water bottles upside down in the corner and unbroken
Yes and here was the torn fragment of silk petticoat and here again was one of the combs she had worn that after noon trampled to bits
And the door of the
big closet was open and several garments were upon the floor pitched about in wildest confusion as if violent struggle had drawn them from their hangers
And the farther door which led to the corridor and the back stairs stood wide open
But of Carmen Hemmett herself there was no sign at all
CHAPTER XI
IS ANY ONE SAFE
NCE upon time in railroad camp just east of the Rockies the seven foot camp bully had sought to impress his will upon Edward Hemmett who chanced to be in charge
They still talk about the battle out that way as one of the liveliest twoman affairs ever staged when it was finally over friends had carried the big man down to the creek and bathed his brow for something like an hour before he returned to life but at one period the outcome had been in doubt for the giants fist had landed directly between Edward Hemmetts two eyes
As concerned Mr Hemmett the entire universe had bounced upward about three inches and settled back again with soulshaking slam and for the second time in his life he experienced the same sensation as he stood in the center of Carmens boudoir
THE ARGOSY
His fists turned to ice were clenched but useless at his sides
His head whirled crazily he could feel his whole body swaying ridiculously for second after sec ond
Then blood began to flow again and Hemmett bounded at the open closet
She simply could not be gone
There had been fight of some kind in here probably with one of the servants be cause servants in Guanama are as prone to do the unexpected as so many dyna mite bombs
And she must have fainted into that closet or no she wasnt in the closet
Hemmett had dived down and both hands had covered the floor in three seconds and again the crazy reeling at tacked his brain
And as quickly the reeling left
This was no time for hysterics
If the mys terious blight had fallen upon his own wife it was the moment of all his existence ripest for quick action
Mr Hemmett conquering the wild glare of his eye the tendency of his voice to rise in shout went back to the door of the bedroom and beckoned the maid
It was gesture so odd that she obeyed instantly and when the door had been closed behind her and the younger Ed ward could not see Hemmett gripped both the girls arms and clutched her so energetically that his fingers drove into the soft flesh
Your mistress
Where is she
She she is not here the girl cried wildly
No and you know it
What hap pened in here her employer snarled
Dye hear
Talk or Ill wring your neck But senor the frightened girl pro tested faintly
do not know
have but waited for the senora
As you found me sitting so have been sitting since the senora closed this door this swear
At at one time it seemed to me that heard fall but called and there was no answer
It was not for me senor to go and open door which This fall when did you hear it Not five minutes back senor One of her arms Mr Hemmett flung away from him the other he gripped the tighter and dragged the girl across toward the corridor door
You come with me he panted
think youre lying but you come with me Quite unaware of her gaspings and stumblings he made for the back stairs and down them to the main floor
There was little foyer here with the kitchen and the storerooms at the sides the cor ridor to the body of the house just behind and the back door just ahead and while it had been Edward Hemmett intention to turn into the kitchen and summon every oily smirking servant in the place he halted at the open door
Part of the story at least lay out this way
On the concrete pavement was the companion to the broken comb upstairs on the pavement too lay little torn strip of ermine fur
It was not perhaps the only bit of ermine in Guanama but it was one of very few and as certainly as if he had seen it torn away Hemmett knew that the white fragment had come from the wide collar of Carmens opera cloak
His very breath seemed to stop
Sub consciously up to this very moment he had been trying to assure himself that the confusion above was merely accident that Carmen had stepped downstairs on some perfectly conventional errand now that last foolish little hope had departed and Hemmett pushing the girl from him was out in the air and looking around wildly
There was nothing whatever to be seen pavement was there and the garden beyond and the stone garage open but never sign of Carmen
He wheeled about causing the maid to scream faint ly and crouch into corner as he passed he dashed at the door of the only model kitchen in Guanama and through it
Amid white tiles and copper pots only the fat elderly Elenida was visible and AMERICANS AFTER ALL
she as he noted dizzily sat in chair and rocked whining the while
What what Hemmett choked
What the devils the matter with you
Wheres Ramon
Gone senor
And evil comes to this house for Gone where In the automobile the white auto mobile the woman chattered
And know that evil comes to this house senor for the gift has been given me to know when these things are to come
My mother senor was one of seven Youll find that gift has some redhot personal application to yourself if you dont calm down her employer said savagely as he shook her
Stop that howling and tell me what has happened
What white automobile
Where was it
Why did Ramon go in it How is it given to me to say that senor the woman choked
It came this milkwhite wagon of the devil and stopped behind the house out there senor
The eversneaking listening Ra mon laughed as it came senor and sped away as if possessed running up the stairway
After that do not know
There was struggle of some kind just over head think and then upon the stairs sound of feet and after that the white wagon went senor swiftly as the wind with Ramon sitting beside the driver And your senora somewhere else in the car Hemmett forced himself to say
The senora The womans eyes rolled in scared amazement
do not know senor
They carried something think
There were two men in the back one white man the other mighty brown man have never seen before
have spoken senor
know no more but the gift was given me early to know when evil was about to befall those who Edward Hemmett had left her
Car mens personal maid where was she
He looked up and down the corridor he raced back to the open air and to the side of the house
He saw her fleeing just turning into the back street
But at least she carried nothing and his heart bounded in momentary relief for an instant an overwrought mind had assured him that even in these few seconds the maid had secured young Edward
Straight upstairs he went without drawing breath through the boudoir and into the bedroom
The boy still sat there with his book and Hemmett snatched him up and held him fast as he made for the main stairway down this and into the room below where Barton sat and wrung his hands and Girton spoke what were intended for soothing reassuring words
Youre ready to start Mr Hem mett the American minister cried
Mr Girton says that My wifes gone too Hemmett exploded
Carmen cried Girton
Snatched out of this house while we were talking in this very room Car mens husband told them
Dont ask me how it happened Steve it did hap pen
Ramon the little devil must have raced upstairs and thrown her opera cloak over her head and carried her down to Joness own car evidently with Jones himself in it He laughed insanely at the sight of Girtons face
And Ill kill Jones and Ill kill Ramon and Ill kill every other dirty little Guanaman that ever took penny of Joness money or Ill Hush Hush
Hemmett fairly screamed
Good God Steve
Havent you any conception of what it means to have ones wife stolen and Yes Ive darned better conception than you think Girton said
Better than might have had myself six months ago
Ned youre going to leave the boy over with his grandfather Yes Then Ill telephone Mercedes and THE ARGOSY
have her come up there with her par ents
Her fathers pretty old man and they havent man servant on the place under sixty or so
It may be silly but cant help it Then telephone her and dont wait here till she arrives Hemmett snapped
understand but times too precious now to waste one minute He scowled as the telephonebell rang
He would have liked to snatch Girton from the room and out on the chase and he snapped his fingers impatiently as the retired secretary of war picked up the instrument and called Mr Hemmetts home
Girton speak ing
Well Then while Barton gnawed his finger nails and Hemmett gave over his finger snapping and tried to soothe his little son to still the frightened weeping that had come with these last few minutes and to answer evasively the questions about mother and where she had gone Mr Girton listened impatiently for the first five seconds mouth opening through the next cheeks whitening steadily through another five
And having listened so long he whirled upon Barton and Hemmett
Mercedes he shouted
Ned Mercedes What is it Steve Theyve got her too
Theyve taken Mercedes
CHAPTER XII
JONES SPEAKS
IN Hemmett the gift for swift thinking was temporarily numbed
Mercedes he repeated almost stu pidly
You dont mean Girton pale and panting was chatter ing at the telephone again
Go on
Go on he said
Yes Im listening
See here Tesoro
Dont waste one second in weeping
Yes shes your daughter but if you knew what she means to me
Yes pardon me
Go on please
Mrs Bar ton has been taken the same way and Carmen too He ground his teeth as the diaphragm clattered frantically for little and then it stilled and his white face grew more tense
Girton nodded thrice listened again and finally rang off with groan
Its the same thing he reported wildly
It must have been all worked out in the finest detail beforehand
Mer cedes and her parents were coming up here for dinner you know Id forgotten it Hemmett con fessed
So had for that matter
It seems according to her father that she was all dressed and ready even to that fuzzy white operacloak of hers
Her mother wasnt quite ready and Mercedes went into the garden and was walking around when His forced calm broke for moment
What else
What else Hemmett cried impatiently
She she was down near the foot of the place Ned and her father happened to be looking that way from his window
He says that there wasnt one seconds warning of what was coming that he saw no sign of an automobile coming into the back street or anything of the kind
That big latticed gate at the bottom of the garden opened and two men shot in threw something over the poor little kid and carried her out bodily to the white automobile that was waiting
He says that before he could even get breath enough to shout the thing was gone and when he went down there as fast as he could go the little policeman who was just coming up the street vowed that no white car had passed
Dye hear Ned
Even the uniformed police hear Hemmett answered grimly and with calm that had come suddenly to him
Barton was on his feet
And now let us start gentlemen he cried
In the name of Heaven let us start and AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Edward Hemmett laid hand upon his arm and smiled smile so awful that Barton gulped and dropped back limply
Mr Barton well start just as soon as we see what were starting after said Hemmett
Ive been thinking pretty hard this last minute or two and it seems to me that perhaps frenzied rush is just what is expected of us and the last thing to do
The impulse yours Girtons mine is to tear out and kill everything in sight But Mr Hemmett Just minute
Were up against something here thats looking bigger to me every minute
In half an hour our wives and Steves sweetheart have been abducted in broad daylight and theyre all women of prominence and way up in Guanama circles
Ordinarily stunt like that would be enough to start revolu tion and the fact that theyve gone about it so brazenly must mean that everything has been arranged for ahead of time
If were to get those women back unharmed wits ll have
to do the job But youre not going to stand here and deliver an oration about it until theyve been Girton began
am not Hemmett corrected sharply picking up his little son again
am going to take Neddfe over to his granddad and rouse Fernandez Steve
Meanwhile you call up the barracks and get Carmens brother Colonel Fernan dez You want him here If the Second Cavalry is as absolute ly right and as absolutely loyal as it has been since put it together want him to come up here with full troop and stand guard on all four sides of his fathers house
That ll take you about two minutes
Then call up Domez and tell him that want him here at once
want Domez personally Steve and
want him here by the time Ive returned from Fernandezs One arm around the boy the other hand on the butt of his automatic Hemmett strode out
The street was perfectly placid as he crossed
The hour of the siesta was long over now and earlydining Guanamans of the better class were strolling out on their way down to the plaza and the evening promenade and band concert
They stared at Mr Hemmett and his fierceness as they saluted him and for moment it seemed that none of the recent nightmare could have taken place and then he was confronting his father inlaw and barking forth the first words of the awful news and the spell was on again
Fernandez did not collapse neither did he scream or wring his hands for Fernandez owned certain solidity that had gone long way toward making him the richest man in Guanama
Rather he paled and listened quietly broke forth for moment in torrent of dreadful promises for the man who had taken his younger daughter then controlled him self and bade Hemmett speed away and have no fear for the boy
Feeling the tiniest shade of relief on one count at least Hemmett raced back to his home
The kids coming with his entire regiment take it Girton reported
He had bugles blowing before he rang off Domez He said he would speed here on the wings of the wind but he didnt seem enthusiastic about it Well give him five minutes Hem mett announced glancing at his watch
have notion that we can learn some thing from him but its not worth waiting longer than that on the chance
You see Domez Hello
Somebody else calling eh He picked up the telephone
This is Hemmett
Well This is Jones said the voice at the other end
Well You
You damned hound The time to stop that sort of tommy rot is right now Mr Hemmett the voice interrupted and even in the surge of fury THE ARGOSY
that was upon him Hemmett recognized the razoredged quality of the tone
am patient man you know
have tried to be very reasonable and liberal with you Hemmett and with Girton and it was really quite useless
Are you calmer now
Can you listen quietly to little proposition do you think What There
That sounds much better Mr Jones assured him
The propo sition is this Mr Hemmett We wish you to leave the country you and yours
Really we do and its no reflection at all upon yourselves
We wish it dp you understand
and what we wish we have as rule
Now the very pleasant and satis factory way to conclude this matter the very obliging way so far as am con cerned it seems to me would be for you and Mr Girton and Mr Barton and the several ladies concerned to leave Guanama this evening on yacht which shall provide and which will take you to the Isthmus and leave you there Jones Oh please the voice said playfully
Ill go farther
Ill have man aboard who will hand you every penny of the splendid sum promised Hemmett who will even take your signature to the con tracts which mentioned providing handsomely for your next ten years
As man to man ask you if any one could do more
If any one who has been treated as you have treated me would do as much
Do you accept No roared Hemmett
And Then listen and dont waste your breath yelling because youll need it all for weeping Mr Jones pursued and the change in his voice was as remarkable as had been the change in his expression during their interview
Youre an ass poor stubborn halfwitted dolt Hemmett
man tries to treat you white and you bawl and bellow at him and let it go at that
Youre going to be out of this country before day after tomorrow all three of you
And believe me Hemmett if youre not you will receive each of you the right ear of the lady in whom he is most interested
On the morning after that you will receive each the left ear of the same lady
And after that Mr Hemmett oh theyre beautiful two of them at any rate
Give your imagination full rein it will not overstep the probabilites believe me The words ended in ripple of sinister laughter
Choking numb and icy from head to foot unable to part his dry hard tips Edward Hemmett for the moment could not believe that he heard aright
So that is really the situation and if you doubt it so much the worse for your selves and your respective ladies the voice went on easily
Youve lost your chance at the money now poor fool still give you the chance to save the women
Do you leave this evening or do you not
You have just one minute in which to answer And here the lips parted Jones cried Mr Hemmett
As sure as theres God above us swear to you that if pay for it with my life Ill He ended in sudden gasp
He jerked the receiverhook up and down
Get that connection again operator
Get that wire again
minute passed and another and another
The diaphragm rattled faintly and Hemmett hung up the receiver with trembling hand
Hes gone he whispered
That was Jones and he has them
And he said that unless we get out of the coun try tonight Carmen and Mercedes He could not continue nor would Barton let him Barton on his feet was shouting Then well give him what he wants
Well go man
Well all go and tell him that Hemmett Im afraid its too late now Hem mett managed
Well stay Barton and promise you that if they dont kill me AMERICANS AFTER ALL
first Ill have the life of eveVy one in Guanama thats mixed up in this plot It was to be sure rather sweeping statement the Size of the intrigue con sidered
Having made it Mr Hemmett snatched up his hat and moved toward the door and even Barton shrank from before the eyes that blazed in his bloodless countenance
Yet as he turned the knob the door opened from the other side and they saw the plump elderly Elenida evidently the last remaining of the household servants and behind her the thick squat figure of Domez chief of detectives
He was more than merely nervous
He entered with what was meant for jaunti ness and his smile was ghastly thing to see
He bobbed his head at them and turning away after his first look into Hemmett eyes nevertheless addressed that gentleman directly You have sent for me snor Yes and now As to the ladies senor yes of certainty the little man broke in
It is of them Heaven be praised that bring news
What It is indeed the truth
They are still to be recaptured without great ef fort senor Domez declaimed fervently thrusting out his hands
This has been discovered by my men senor that the ladies even now have been started on their journey to the hill country CHAPTER XIII
ALVAREZ BRINGS TIDINGS OMING through the red haze of fury thaf enveloped the senses of all threej there was something strangely steadying in the statement of the de tective chief
It was as matter of fact the very first definite concrete bit to rise to the surface of the turmoil and Hemmett at least seized upon it within the second
One stride and he had gripped the smaller Domez by either shoulder his eyes were burning into Domezs own and he was saying HU country
Which hill country Ah senor
Not to that accursed region where rocks freeze the soul and Never mind the poetry
Where are they being taken To the region of Las Almas senor where once the senor great army was in training
There senor are the es teemed the suffering senoras the lovely senorita to be taken This time he faced Hemmett squarely and the effect was rather curious
Mr Hemmett returned the stare and found himself facing smile in which relief played no small part
Mr Hemmetts lips opened suddenly and closed again so suddenly that they heard the click of his teeth
Well go on Domez he said quiet ly
Your men found out that much My men indeed senor It was clever
What else is there to tell And now he even smiled and deep pleased breath escaped the chief of de tectives
He looked keenly at Hemmett for an instant and grew downright bland
See senor what it is to have trained men to the great efficiency he said
It has been learned it has been re ported to me by Perequito peer of all detectives in Guanama that vast plot exists even as the senor has suspected that the ladies were to be held as hostages
This came to my ears senor and leaped to action that should pre vent the crime
Too late
Even as my men were mustered word came that the worst had happened see said Mr Hemmett even more quietly
What else With all speed despatched Pere quito and seven others senor to learn what might be learned and that without an instants delay
And senor the hon ored secretary of war had but telephoned me little while ago when they came to report once more
THE ARGOSY
The ladies have been taken and are being held by superior force so that my men dared not attack yet they have learned that special train was waiting senor
They have learned that the scoundrels mean to imprison the ladies in the far hills and have provided for the rescue How The large official police car waits without with five men senor and nine more have been sent to follow the special should it start before we can reach it
Come then and it may be that even before they can start from Puerto Carlo the rescue may be effected
If not Well If not we will follow by the high road pass the train and await it at Las Almas
Come He turned toward the door with queer assured little jerk as if entirely certain that Hemmett and the rest would follow
For that matter Mr Hemmett did take pace or two after him but only to call Domez Senor Dont hurry away
Just wait min ute like this
Hemmett lunged
His powerful fin gers wound suddenly about the amazed little mans thick throat swing and the chief of detectives had been flattened face up across the heavy table
And Mr Hemmett choking at him with an enthusiasm that boded ill for Domez hissed Stop that gurgling
look like an idiot Domez thats evident but there are still few people in this abandoned hole who cant put anything over on me and it is your misfortune to be among the number Senor squawked thickly from the throat
want the truth and want it quick and Heaven help you Domez if you dont tell it
want to kill somebody and youre handiest
Talk and dont try to wriggle loose The truth the truth senor Domez sputtered wildly
do not know the truth
Then think Ill send you where theyll get it out of you with redhot pitchfork Hemmett stated and the fingers tightened again
And not without effect this time for Domezs thick fingers gripped his hands and tugged at them as his face blackened
Domez just as Mr Hemmett was read justing his grip screamed Hear me then
Hear me senor Well Hemmett relaxed his hold almost regretfully
It is but the orders of the great senor the Senor Jones that follow cried the detective chief who had acquired remarkable directness of thought and speech during the last few seconds
speak the truth in this
swear it
It has been said to me by the Senor Jones himself thflt the women are to be ab ducted and that the police are not to see
He paid me much money senor before this thing was done Dont stop there Hemmett said quickly
Where have they been taken Kill me but that cannot tell you shrieked Domez
certain signal senor certain signal and was to come and say to you that the women went to the hills
More than this do not know but If eyes meant anything if waving hands and general expression meant any thing he was telling the truth this time
Mr Hemmett the fingers still on the throat studied the popeyed congested countenance for many long seconds at last to release the little man and step away
Thats enough Domez
Youll stay here while now That that is the truth senor the detective chief chattered staggering to his feet
And as for staying here dare not go farther now
Jones has spies senor even in the churches of Guanama
Jones has spies in every store in every street in every stable and garage and AMERICANS AFTER ALL
every company of the army Jones has spies
Now he will kill me And darned little loss to anybody Mr Hemmett observed
Ill settle with you later Domez
Just now Whos that Some one else to be sure had arrived some one who came into the house with bound spoke swiftly to Elenida apparently dashed into their very midst
Girton cried
It was indeed Alvarez their friend Alvarez who had been their friend years ago when first they came to Guanama
He had been very young man in those days now he had prospered and the Alvarez docks eventually bade fair to handle the bulk of Puerto Carlos com merce
But he was the same old Alvarez hon est and open as the day devoted to themselves as he had been in the earlier times and now he stood with hands outstretched in wildest excitement
Senores he cried gaspingly
The Senora Hemmett the lovely Senorita Tesoro the Senora Barton think
have seen have seen Seen them Girton said
Alvarez gripped himself hard well aware of times value
have seen them he said swiftly
At this minute they are being taken from Puerto Carlo on the torpedoboat destroyer El Fuego CHAPTER XIV
CONCERNING THE NAVY
VENTS had pressed very swiftly this late afternoon
False though they knew it to be the impression of the women being taken to the hills still lingered in three brains
Hence three men stared blankly at Alvarez while the fourth which was Domez huddled down in corner of the room and gazed fear fully at the windows El Fuego Hemmett stammered after second or two
El Fuego to be sure senor the swift the racer El Fuego
have seen it with my own eyes How From the roof of my No
dock where men were working and where went to see the progress they had made
stood there Senor Hemmett gazing across the harbor and as gazed there left the yachtclub dock speedy tender and How long ago Girton shot at him
Six minutes perhaps seven it cannot be longer
came here so swiftly Senor Girton that police from one end of town to the other screamed at me and sought to pursue my little car
stood there then and watched the tender and in it saw women struggling violently two of them that is while the third the Senora Barton sat and wept groan escaped her husband
stood astounded unbelieving Alvarez raced on dramatically
Havora the contractor was there as well enjoying his view with his binoculars
snatched them from him
looked more closely
am here And its the last place for us to be Hemmett snarled as he dashed into the library and out of the library and to the terrace overlooking the harbor
When with the exception of Domez who still cowered in his corner they came to his side Hemmetts glasses were focusing on midharbor
Nor had Alvarez erred
Ten seconds and the powerful lenses were cutting cleanly the deck of El Fuego first of the new destroyers
Smoke belched from the three short funnels anchors were already up and the boat already in motion and on the deck in plain sight of all who cared to look was the brilliant spot that must be Carmens operacloak
And there gowned in gray was the form of middleaged woman too yes and just coming into sight led by white man who could be none other than William Jones was young woman in THE ARGOSY
long white cloak
Her features he could not see at the distance nor was there any need of seeing them
Mercedes Tesoro was an intimate of the Hemmett household since the early part of the season Hemmett had seen that same white cloak wide and volumi nous spreading at the bottom
It was Mercedes
Youre right Hemmett said briefly
He has them there and and he means to carry out the program he threatened
Well never catch them in your motorboat Girton cried running beside him to the steps and the street
Never and we couldnt get aboard if we did Steve said Hemmett
But well get them well get em or is that your car Alvarez At the service of yourselves Yachtclub dock and go like the devil Hemmett directed as he leaped in
There was roar from the motor and for time the two most eminent Americans in Guanama had left their home neighborhood
Just why Alvarez failed to dash them to bits on the steep hill passes explanation now and then his light car left the ground altogether bounding crazily from one side of the street to the other now and then turn ing corner it seemed that they were about to leave the vehicle altogether and hurtle through the windows of home
and yet Alvarez had not lost his smile when they came to the level part of town and with Girton jabbing incessantly at the horn broke every speed law ever laid down for the regulation of Puerto Carlo traffic
The business section merely flitted past and then the poorer residential quarter
Out there in the twilight the harbor stretched away mysteriously with every now and then glimpse of El Fuego steaming straight for the open sea
Hemmett jaws set was ready to leap at the yachtclubhouse before the car had even slowed down and cheerfully aban doning his property Alvarez darted after at Girtons side
There was certain mistaken attend ant who came forward smiling and bowing and smirking to welcome the eminent members
Because of his error in bowing directly before Hemmett he picked himself up from the far corner of the big assembly room vaguely of the impression that tropical earthquake had taken place and while he was still sitting on the floor Edward Hemmett had leaped into the beautiful cedar boat and was working over the engine while Alvarez and Girton dragged back the canvas cover
And they were off
Spray whirling up in white mass settling then until it seemed that sheet of clear glass stood high above either side of the speedboat the expensive ex quisite craft whirled out into the harbor with Hemmett camped grimly behind its automobile stering wheel
Just once Girton managed Where Destroyer Pavoroso Hemmett shouted
Only thing afloat around here thatll catch her Then he pushed spark and throttle for ward to their last notch and bent his head before the wind and so they whizzed down Puerto Carlo harbor and directly to the side of the Pavoroso com panion destroyer to the El Fuego
But two or three sailors were visible languid and not greatly interested until the speedboat came directly alongside
As the motor stopped however the trio above quickened and grew visibly excited and expectant of just what
Mr Hemmett would have given much to know as he climbed the short Jacobs ladder cast one backward glance at Alvarez busy with securing the motor boat and barked Mozo
Where is he El capitan senor
He is ashore the sailor nearest responded
So much the better
Youre in com mand of the craft Steve
Drill any man who disobeys or tries to leave
Alvarez AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Senor Get into the wirelesshouse quick
If theres nobody on duty stay there and keep every one out
If there is any one there see that he doesnt work the ap paratus
Wheres the engineroom
see And having apparently taken over the boat for his own purpose these lhst twenty seconds he was gone
He had been aboard the Pavoroso on the day of her first coming when the reception was tendered and he had agreed heartily at the time that Guanama had acquired the fastest thing in destroyers and he remembered the general layout
So it came that reaching the chief en gineers office in rather less than another twenty seconds Mr Hemmett walked in and snapped his fingers at the portly ornately uniformed official who smoked in the easy chair
You Rodero
How much steam have you Steam senor
Oh it is the Senor Hemmett said the Pavorosos chief and the queer insolence he had seen in other quarters was before Hemmett again
had thought senor that you had left Guanama
No Steam
pound or two perhaps
No more
The fires are banked senor and Why do you ask Because Im interested
Snatch down that telephone and tell em to have running head of steam in those boilers as quick Oh but my good Senor Hemmett the chief smiled flatly and impudently
How can it be that one accepts orders from yourself
Our new president has appointed you the secretary of the navy perhaps or given you command of the Pavoroso Ill tell you how it can be that one accepts orders from me the caller ex plained as his automatic pressed directly over the chiefs heart as the chief himself turned white abruptly raised heavy arms hastily
cant waste time explaining the matter Rodero but can tell you one thing youll have this boat running under full head of steam without losing more than one second or Ill kill you and take charge of this end myself
Which He was of course insane
The chief engineer who entertained hearty respect for armed lunatics did indeed snatch down his telephone and the sincerity of the words he uttered into it almost warmed Hemmetts chilling heart
And having uttered them he dropped back in his chair scared and perspiring and the cold blue of Edward Hemmetts eye drilled through his very soul
El Fuego has just started out of the harbor bound for dont know where said the owner of the eye
Were going to overhaul her or blow up this boat and if through any fault of yours we do neither you will not come back
You know me pretty well Rodero
If you want to take chance on any tricky stuff take it Below coal was rattling and shovels scraping and if Rodero knew Mr Hem mett it was more certain that Hemmett knew Rodero
In the wellfilled ranks of fullblown Guanaman cowards Rodero was among the brighter lights
Judging by his present expression the odds that he would try disobedience were perhaps one to five hundred and Hemmett ac cepted them with grunt and hurried back to the deck
Girton after fashion had taken command
Some thirty of the crew were standing there regarding him silently as he addressed them too silently and in surly fashion that was far from reas suring
Touched by the unusual mood that had grown so curiously prevalent the crowd looked downright ugly
Girton turned to his friend and snapped in English Safe to risk it with this gang Is there any other way of risking it But yes senor Alvarez put in un expectedly
There is indeed another way for even can be of assistance
THE ARGOSY
Even though it be possible pray that you do not start until return He had left them
He had gone over the side like monkey and was down in Hemmetts motorboat and backing away from the long thin destroyer
Somewhat dazedly Hemmett watched him go wondered just where he might be heading observed that he was making directly for his own docks and turned to find that the destroyers crew on their own initiative had moved forward in body
What did you say to them Steve Hemmett asked
told them that we were going to sea and that they were under my or ders and they hardly made sign one way or the other
One of the devilish little petty officers laughed and shrugged his shoulders and that was about all And if they try anything rough therell be three of us to handle thirty or forty of them providing that Alvarez gets back Hemmett muttered
He turned and peered through the thickening twilight to the harbor mouth and the Atlantic beyond
The stern of El Fuego was just vanishing as she head ed down the coast and behind her lay heavy trail of black smoke
It may not have been sob that escaped Hemmett it was at any rate sound that caused Girtons hand to rest rather suddenly on his arm and Girton to say Dont let yourself think about it know that sounds ridiculous but its the only way to keep from going mad just now
When looked at that crew and saw the way some of them were looking at me and considered the way Guanaman crew ought to look at one of us why for second or two was on the very verge of pulling the gun wiping out such of the little rats as could and then going down in fight with the rest
Thats the sort of mental state well have to avoid old man if were ever if were ever He himself had to pause for mo ment
Hemmett breathed deeply
Well were going to bring the girls back or were not coming back ourselves if thats what you mean he said
This little pesthole of country has never beaten us yet Steve and it cant beat us now But its closer to it at this minute than it has ever come before Girton snllled bitterly
Side by side they gazed through the gloom toward the Alvarez dock
The speedboat had disappeared long before this and the smokeclouds overhead were growing very dense
In very few min utes the gages below would show head of steam and if Alvarez had not reap peared when there was pressure enough to send the engines into action there would be two men against the crowd in stead of three
Although from the thick evening mists near the Alvarez dock that gentleman himself certainly seemed to be returning now
The foggy white spot was the spray of the speedboat but the spray and the motion of the craft behind it were dif ferent now
Ordinarily Mr Hemmetts marine wonder almost soared over the surface of the water whereas it was al most wallowing now
Its owner and his friend stepped to the other rail and strained their eyes
Shes loaded down Steve Hem mett muttered
Yes and with men breathed the retired secretary of war
Look at it
There must be fifteen of them jammed up forward and there are as many more aft Silently they watched and be it ad mitted thrilled little
If it was relief expedition Alvarez was wonder
He had been gone all told perhaps eight minutes and now he was coming along side again the highspeed engine ham mering viciously under its unusual load
And now it had ceased hammering and the crew of the Pavoroso were streaming aft and Alvarez before them threw out his hands and smiled glori fied smile
AMERICANS AFTER ALL
It is done senores he reported
To sacrifice the beautiful boat is sin yet we cannot drown these pigs who have elected to laugh at the great Senor Girton
You will stand back senores It was more than request and they were already standing back for over the side of the Pavoroso swarmed uncouth men great husky men picd for their jobs as heavyweight dockworkers large tough men in shirts and flapping linen trousers who went to work without one seconds delay as Alvarez their employer barked commands
The general sense gained by Hemmett and Girton during those dizzying seconds was that the Pavorosos regular crew was being ordered into and then thrown bod ily into the speedboat
Fists flew here and there for moment some one fired shot and thanks to dreadful uppercut from brown fist toppled over the side with the smoking pistol still in his hand
whitefaced little officer evidently first assistant engineer came trotting to report that steam was up and the anchors weighing nor had he more than stam mered the words and hurried away than the quiver of engines shook the vessel
And fifty yards astern the packed motorboat with its yelling snarling passengers drifted toward the shore
The Pavoroso shook again
The fifty yards widened suddenly
The chase was on
CHAPTER XV
SHELL ACROSS THE BOWS
CUCH is the psychological distinction between motion and the lack of mo tion Girton and Hemmett felt their spirits rising higher with every turn of the highpowered engines
Carmen Mercedes and Bartons wife might be in position quite as perilous as heretofore or even more perilous if Jones chanced to resent the pursuit but at least help was coming nearer to them every minute now
The destroyer surged out between the crescent points of the harbor and headed south in the brilliant light of the rising tropical moon before they quite realized that the thing had been accomplished and that Alvarez was missing
He turned up suddenly smiling
All seems well senores he reported brisklv
Eh have visited every part of the vessel save the engineroom which seems to be working nicely
There are on deck no more than six or seven of the crew for many were ashore on leave and these six or seven having felt the hands of my men are humble and willing to obey
Youre youre wonder Alvarez Girton muttered
To serve yourselves senores that is joy the younger man stated with smile
Later perhaps these men of mine will be of further service and upon them you may depend for they are tried and true fighters loyal to me which means loyal to yourselves
speak they obey
What is next to be done There was something distinctly helpful about Alvarez with his excited smile and his utter confidence in the force he had precipitated so astonishingly on the destroyer Pavoroso
Looking at him it was rather difficult to believe that all would not end well and Hemmett even smiled faintly
It might be as well for both of us to leave this rail and give up trying to see vessel already out of sight he said and find out just what weve got aboard
Hows the wireless man Alva rez Small and easily cowed Alvarez reported
He was smoking in his little cabin senor when we came aboard with the telephones on his ears and evidently expecting something
You will now find him somewhere outside his cabin and here is the key
You will take it may need it and Hemmett dropped it into his pocket
Well leave THE ARGOSY you in charge of the deck Alvarez and see the navigating officer
The ship isnt steering herself take it Young Arturo Polito is in charge
You remember him Guanamas professional fat boy eh Girton said
remember him very well
He graduated from our naval college remember that too because indorsed his application Hemmett at his side he walked to the wheelhouse and opened the door
Polito was indeed its only tenant very plump and sleepyeyed young brown man good natured as ever
They greeted him with mingled emotions for he among some thousands of others had much cause to be loyal to Guanama
So you were in it too eh Mr Hemmett observed
In it and out of it again senor ap parently said the second officer of the Pavoroso quite easily
Many strange things have happened recently in our navy senor things about which one may ask questions and learn nothing
had intended in another week or two to ask for my discharge and join my father in business for do not like strange things
And now few minutes gone the excellent Senor Alvarez points pistol and informs me that on pain of death we are to catch El Fuego
So now If you understand that much youve got it all Polito Girton said sharply
Can we overhaul the boat It is possible it is not likely Polito said placidly as he kindled fresh cigar ette
On the trials you know El Fuego averaged the tenth part of mile better than this vessel
That is the difference Then get busy with your engineroom telegraph and see if the Pavoroso cant make that extra tenth herself and little more
Because were going to overhaul El Fuego His steady eye bored into the large cowlike orbs of Polito some ten seconds Polito studied the gaze and the face of the man behind it and then with little shiver he nodded
Yes senor said he plainly con vinced
If it be within human power we are to overhaul El Fuego
Be as sured of my poor best efforts to that end He picked up the speakingtube and took to shouting energetically and sin cerely as Rodero had shouted to his fire room force
Hemmett and Girton little easier left him and walked forward where Alvarez already peered into the night ahead
have ordered the searchlight manned he reported
It is one of the wonders of the navy this Pavoroso searchlight
With it and the moon we shall soon pick up El Fuego think He was wrong
The searchlight flaring out after another two or three minutes swept the water ahead all in vain
East of their path it went and west through painful minutes
There was no sign of El Fuego
Half an hour had gone then and abruptly pencil of light rose on the skyline dead ahead rose and disappeared again
Thats it Mr Girton exclaimed
And theyre making for the open sea theyre heading east
added his friend
In that senor think you are wrong Alvarez smiled
have had speech with one Barra head of the fire room
He spoke freely to me senor for we are old friends
It is said by Barra that the other destroyer is making straight for Parilla to take on coal Eh And think that this is true senor because coal for El Fuego is lying at my own dock and was to have been taken aboard tomorrow And the bunkers here They are full senor Well that sounds something like
Girton exclaimed
That ought to mean that well overhaul them before mid night Before eleven should say senor Alvarez answered cheerfully
Again their anxious hearts quickened again as the searchlight was switched AMERICANS AFTER ALL
off at last they took to peering through the soft moonlight reaches
They were doing all that lay within the Pavoroso several trips below at reg ular intervals proved that much
What ever Roderos affiliation with the plot that bade fair to make Guanama the ranking traitor nation of history the chief engineer was accepting this evening at its full face value
The periodical visits below of Hemmett may have had something to do with it or the three square jawed tattered steve dores who stood about the engineroom at any rate it was certain that another pound of steam would rend the boilers
They had been heading south for an hour and now they had been heading south for two hours and more and despite his best efforts fear was creeping into the heart of each man that Alvarez had been wrong and that El Fuego was not bound for Parilla and coal
Her searchlight after that one flash had not reappeared and terrified pessimism was working its way to Girtons lips when Alvarez cried suddenly There senores
The smoke to starboard
She is running not mile from the coast
Do you see The moon was coming from five minute obscurity behind thick scurrying clouds and through the growing light they strained their eyes again and El Fuego was there surely enough
Plowing along far far ahead that thin dark spot with the thin white wake must be El Fuego and Hemmett fairly bounded into the wheelhouse and hurled at the sleepyeyed Polito Shes over there
Can we pick her up with the searchlight It should be possible senor Try it Tense seconds and the white stream shone across the rolling ocean nosed about for bit and rested steadily upon the destroyer ahead and to their excited eyes it seemed that even in the seconds El Fuego had lost ground
She was nearer by quarter of mile or was it only two hundred yards
or was it anything at all
Mr Hemmett gave it up and dashed toward the wirelesshouse where the philosophical operator still sat upon the step and smoked
Wake up he shouted
The doors open get in there and call El Fuego message senor the operator said calmly
message for Jones yes see that you know Jones
Get him you and tell him to stop thats all
Tell him to stop or well sink him my man and remember that Im standing here beside you and that spent several years in wireless work and that if you begin sending code or anything else mysterious youll go overboard and Ill do the sending my self Considering that his one attempt to learn the mysteries of the Continental wireless alphabet had been dismal fail ure the statement was slight exaggera tion yet it went well enough
The operator had absorbed some of this evenings atmosphere aboard the destroy er he seated himself obediently and set his quenched sparkgap to hissing and crackling softly
He adjusted his tuning apparatus and waited
Once more he called once more he waited and this time he smiled slightly
They are listening he reported
They refuse to take message How can they Hemmett snapped
How can one force them to take message when the telephones are thus easily removed the operator smiled blandly laying aside his own
You put those back on your head and send them message whether they acknowledge it or not commanded Mr Hemmett
Tell Jones to stop or well sink him yes and Ill put an added point to it too He dashed off again leaving the oper ator pressing resignedly at his key
He found Girton and Alvarez where he had left them
THE ARGOSY
Well send one shot across their bows he announced
What is this affair threeinch rifle Yes the new type Girton assented
Five charges in the small magazine at the base and probably couple of Hun dred more below One will do for us
Firing her is your job Steve
Can you get the range In minute or two said Girton without great enthusiasm
He could not forget that Mercedes Tesoro was prisoner aboard El Fuego he could not drive from his mind the fact that this was the ocean and that his really deep artillery study of recent years had been all upon land
Up at Las Almas in the training days of the army both as an example and because the practise interested him deeply the secretary of war had per sonally piled up score at the targets which still stood unmatched but this well this was different
Still he went to work and Alvarez at his side watched every move absorbedly drinking in each little detail with that overwhelming interest that had gone so far toward making his own success
Ready Girton announced simply
Let her go There was flash and roar and shock that set the slender bow of the Pavoroso to quivering and six hands clasped at the rail while six eyes darted down the path of the searchlight to El Fuego
And cry escaped three mouths for there was splash and spurt of white water just ahead of the other destroyer and El Fuego even when they had stared hardly breathing through an other minute showed no signs of coming to standstill
Didnt they see it Hemmett mut tered wonderingly
They saw it fast enough but Jones is aboard that boat said Girton
We neednt stop at that
Ive got the range business down to hairs breadth Well The next one goes through her engineroom Ned To sink her gasped Mr Hemmett
She will not sink Girton smiled
Shell stop though and theyll shut her watertight compartments in hurry and by the time theyve been shut we ought to be alongside and boarding her Alvarez all enthusiasm all faith was even now drawing out another shell and another firing charge and although the very notion sent chills up and down Hemmett spine he offered no objection
Teeth set he watched Girton tinker his rangefinder delicately almost unbreath ingly and the wireless man was beside them with fluttering bit of paper
They have answered senor he cried
have sent as you requested and they have replied Edward Hemmett snatched the paper from him and held it in the faint reflected light from the searchlight
It was ad dressed to himself and it read The women are lashed to the after deck
The boats and every man on board are ready to leave
If you wish to sink El Fuego sink her CHAPTER XVI
JONES COMES ABOARD
VOU are ready senor Alvarez was saying tensely
You watch the spot beside their engineroom and youll see Mr Girton was just beginning
Well dont Hemmett shouted
You you here wireless
Get back there and say say nothing at all until give the word Girton turned somewhat blankly from his gun
What now Jones says that all hands are ready to leave Steve which means that if you put hole through her they wont bother with the compartments
And the women are lashed down tight The gunners enthusiasm cooled ab AMERICANS ruptly
His hands dropped and he smiled bitterly
Jones always seems to have some thing ready doesnt he
His coals giving out too and hes slowing down
Look at that Yes and since hes so handy with the ultimatum stuff Ill have try at it my self Hemmett stormed
Well be alongside in another five minutes and Im going to warn him that He broke off and sped after the radio man
He found that person sitting before his instruments telephones already ad justed and smiling interestedly
The operator held up restraining hand
moment sefior he cried softly
More is coming now His pencil scratched ahead and Hem mett scowling over his shoulder watched the words and damned his own earlier lack of persistence in matters telegraphic
His mind would have been easier could he have but read those clicks and buzzes audible even with the telephones on the mans head
We are coming to anchor grew swiftly to You will drop anchor at least five hundred yards astern
Should you fail to do this or should you choose in any way to attack El Fuego the women will be shot in cold blood before you can possibly reach us This time the signature of William Jones was added and having scrawled it the operator looked up
They have signed off senor he reported
That is the end of the mes sage Without comment Mr Hemmett snatched it from the table and left the little cabin
moment only he hesitated as at the door of the wheelhouse he gazed across the black water El Fuego was gliding to full stop and they were coming very very near to her now
The distance between was surely less than half mile and should Jones happen to estimate it as less Mr Hemmett barked an order at Polito which set the engineroom telegraph going sud AFTER ALL
denly and hurried to his friend still in the bow still gazing at El Fuego
Theyve stopped Girton said super fluously
Whats the matter with this tub
Engines busted Were stopping too Mr Hemmett snarled
Here read it Glasses were not needed now to watch El Fuego
The moon had disappeared again and the searchlight showed the motionless destroyer against back ground of solid impenetrable black and showed as well the bustling about toward the stern where hung the gasoline tender
Whatever their purpose they were making ready to lower away the little boat
Men were scrambling in to the number of half dozen Guanaman sailors all by their uniforms then dis tant and tiny the figure of Jones advanced and climbed into the tender and after him man in civilian togs whom they had not seen before
The tender slid to the black water and they caught the faint hum of the engines
Ive read it Girton muttered as his eyes went back to El Fuego
Hes coming aboard here Yes and the other boats are swung out from El Fuego and shes settling too said Hemmett
Settling Look at her
She hasnt taken on any cargo since we started Steve but shes half foot lower in the water Silently they studied the new phenom enon for little while the tender hummed through the night toward them
It had covered half the distance before Girton coming to the end of new train of thought spoke softly Alvarez
Yes senor and the younger man came closer
Have them drop that long boat on the port side and have it done quick
Then pick me dozen of your men who can scrap
See understand senor
And then Youve dealt them out the pistols from the arsenal below THE ARGOSY
They are all armed senor Then Im going to take them over and officially capture El Fuego as soon as Jones sets foot on this deck Mr Girton said simply
If ever stand here and look at him and think about the girls Hemmett nodded quickly
had thought of the same thing he said
Take Alvarez with you and beat it Steve
Ill have the searchlight kept off the water and when youve matters in your own hands start the wireless
Make dots and nothing else you can manage that Inasmuch as Ive been giving lessons in field wireless yes And if you need help simply point the searchlight at the sky and leave it there because shall be able to quit Jones and come to help you about three minutes after he has boarded us Youre not going to slaughter the man Heaven forbid Mr Hemmett said grimly
Im going to hang on to my self if can until see whos with him and hear what he has to say and think can The Pavorosos searchlight switched around to reveal the tender not fifty yards distant and making gracefully for the destroyer
Hemmett bit off the words and Stephen Girton was gone
He heard Girton cross the dock heard the soft pattering of many feet and the creak of pulleys and presently the faintest little splash
Mr Hemmett stepped to the man at the searchlight and snapped an order his white beam rose and hung over the top of El Fuego in purposeless fashion and up from the starboard landingstage in the most matteroffact fashion William Jones was stepping to the deck of the destroyer
Calmer or more pleasantly smiling no man could have been
An assured lazy little swagger was in his walk and his shoulders swung to it
Behind him in the faint illumination of the destroyers decklights stood short thickset Gua naman and for an instant as he viewed the latter Hemmetts fury at Jones almost subsided for that was Jose Canita new president of the National Bank of Guanama millionaire who ranked almost with Fernandez mighty hidden power in the darker more mys terious depths of politics and sometimes mentioned as the most powerful one man in all Guanama
Lowbrowed pigeyed oily he smiled directly and significantly at Edward Hemmett and in less than five seconds Hemmett felt queerly he had learned more about the plot more about the recent elections than he had ever known before
Our dear Mr Hemmett eh Jones observed easily
Oh you know the excellent Canita dont you
wish you wouldnt look at him just like that Hemmett it isnt politic
He might insist on having you taken back and sentenced to death by one of his pet judges or something like that
Wheres dear Stephen Girton He didnt come Hemmett snapped
Well Didnt he really Jones smiled
Is Stephens superb vitality ebbing that he funked the spectacular chase
could have sworn that hed be with you ready to eat the whole world raw and hello
What the devil kind of crew have we here he concluded with genuine interest as he gazed at the tattered group of overdeveloped dock workers that hovered near
Thats the substitute crew Hem mett said
Theyll let you alone unless Oh theyll let me alone without any unless Jones assured him
Well Mr Flemmett
Youre calmer observe
Thats nice
Youve been looking at El Fuego believe these last minutes
Is it necessary to outline the situation in mere words It is not Canitas rasping accent put in
You are not fool Senoi AMERICANS AFTER ALL
You are ready now think to do the wise thing
The wonderful Senor Jones will still guarantee that you and the women shall be delivered safely at the Isthmus
It is most gdnerous
It is more than should do Because if that bullheaded dementia still possesses you the little game will end here and now Hemmett Jones pursued
Upon my word you dont seem very intelligent after all
Do you quite realize that the seacocks on El Fuego are open and water coming into her hull at the rate of an inch every minute or so
Havent your eyes told you that my men are in the boats ready to leave when the boats themselves come to the water level
Dont you really believe that your ladies are trussed to the rail over there Hem mett He sauntered nearer and looked at Mr Hemmett interestedly
Now youve got about ten minutes to decide he explained
Guanama doesnt need you Hemmett you or Girton
Neither does the er railroad which have the honor to represent
Ill still let you have your ladies intact
Ill take you to the yacht mentioned aboard this very boat Hemmett
And please dont glare
Youre dreadful and desperate character but all by my little self still have you where the hair is very short
You cant give particle of assistance to the unfortunately sinking El Fuego old chap because you cant get there
Even if your whole somewhat shabby looking crew here were to pile into the small boats it would really avail nothing at all because my own crew have orders to fire on everything and anything my own tender excepted that comes in sight
You take the general sense of the argu ment Im sure
Now what propose is this you will come with me to El Fuego as hostage
Well get the ladies and well get my crew
Your own remarkable crowd here will put out for the shore
And then well turn around and steam back to Puerto Carlo and youll have pleasant trip on nice yacht just as soon as Ive had Mr Girton sandbagged and brought aboard
And youll have the positive assur ance that if you ever show your faces again in Guanama youll be shot on sight
Do seem to exaggerate
It is wrong impression believe me
Sweeping changes are coming in Guanama oh so soon
Well These last few seconds Hemmett had been straining his ears for sounds across the water
When they came something inside informed him there were certain things which he would do in fraction of time less than measurable
But they had not come yet
And the fact that we are American citizens Jones he began
Thats old stuff dreary old stuff these days Jones said impatiently
If youre nasty youll be dead citizens you know and dead or alive you may be entirely sure that no credible word will ever come to your precious United States
If you live and raise rumpus youll find officially that you were expelled from Guanama for arson or grand larceny or something of the sort
If you die pouf
control every means
of commu nication out of Guanama
control every newspaper in the country
con Across the water wild chorus of yells rose suddenly and wilder than any of them was Edward Hemmetts own yell aboard the Pavoroso
Heres where one swelled head is smashed
thundered Mr Hemmett as he plunged at Mr Jones
CHAPTER XVII
SEACOCKS AND ACCIDENTS
LIPPING across the black water Stephen Girton gazed
hard at the moon and drew breath of relief
That cloud was growing thicker toward the THE ARGOSY
center and the moon would remain be hind it for all of fifteen minutes
And he seemed to have left the Pavoroso without attracting attention
Jones was aboard too by this time
His tender was bobbing at the ladder and Girton held his breath once more as he watched the three or four sailors in her and prayed fervently that the almost inaudible plashing of oars might not reach them across that bare two hundred feet of black water
And then he eased for they were quite absorbed in their own chatter smoking laughing they sat about the engine pit and now the danger virtually was over
And the job that lay ahead was not exactly without danger
Behind him were some dozen of Alvarezs men armed fighters by preference but on El Fuego what might he find
The little destroyers were always un dermanned and shoreleave prompted by universal sympathy with the Guanaman thirst was chronic evil of the navy but it was entirely possible that forty or fifty armed men were awaiting his coming
Not that it mattered very much save as concerned the chances of quick suc cess
With Mercedes aboard El Fuego the powers of evil themselves would only have invited Mr Girton to battle to night
He whispered ordering little more speed he looked very thoughtfully at the faces about him and then glancing up at the lights he noted that they were fairly under the stern of El Fuego and sliding around to the starboard side and the ladder
And just overhead now
Why men were swarming out of the small boats there
They had been detected at last and they were bumping the side and his own men were rising as one and Mr Girton automatic in hand bounded up the ladder to El Fuegos deck
The very suddenness of his advent seemed to have paralyzed those nearest him
Teeth bared gun for the moment forgotten the pentup emotions of the evening exploded within Stephen Girton
There was dark face near and rifle barrel his fist obliterated the dark face and the rifle flew overboard
And behind him there were yells and the jostling of his own men and shot or two and after that for little Hades itself broke loose
Although for Girton it was joyful infernal region
His fists were swinging and swirling pounding and hammering ecstatically
Men were yelling and men were falling in twinkling instant he saw Raporta first officer of El Fuego narroweyed and savage fire shot at one of the dock workers saw the first officer lifted bodily and sent crashing to the deck senseless saw knife coming in his own direction and heard the crazy scream as he gripped the arm and all but tore it from its socket saw Patero mightiest of the stevedores as three men dragged at him saw Patero hurl one out of sight along the deck and the other bodily into the near outhanging cutter saw him grip the neck of the third and squeeze and shake until the bulgingeyed face vanished from Mr Girtons ken in new surge of battle
Another knife was coming his way and he leaped toward it and laughed madly for his very expression seemed to have frightened the senses out of this latest member of El Fuegos crew and he had thrown away the knife and was running to the side saw three more coming at him head down and leaped at them as well bleeding fists hurling at them like two triphammers
There was perhaps nothing really civilized or intellectually uplifting in any of it but the fact remained that all things considered Stephen Girton had not enjoyed himself so thoroughly in long long time
And then why he was slamming and punching at the empty air and dock man with one eye closed and cheek badly cut was grinning at him and saying AMERICANS AFTER ALL
Enough senor
They have fled
See one and all they have gone and those that could not flee were thrown after into the boats Eh stammered Mr Girton
And the women senor
They have been liberated and they are unharmed for He said no more
Girton in one sec ond had come to his senses had looked about swiftly and had Mercedes Tesoro in his arms
It was heartstopping moment
The civilized element in Girton welled up and silently and fervently he gave up thanks as he pressed the frightened sobbing girl to him
It was the first tear that Mercedes had shed since that astounding rpoment at the foot of the garden as these were the first tears of Carmen Hemmett standing by Mrs Barton and striving to still the hysteria that had afflicted the older lady ever since the beginning of the amazing adventure
Stephen Girton returned to life quite suddenly
Patero white and breathless still was tapping his arm
Senor he said
The vessel is sinking What It is said by Miguelo that the sea cocks have been opened
He would ask if the senor would know how they may be closed Girton blinking bit his lips
dont know he confessed
Get the searchlight into action and If it needs electricity senor it is impossible said Patero
Water is in the firerooms and the engineroom
This much have seen but if there be other power perhaps If there is dont know how to find it Girton told him
Im no marine engineer and Unusual man that he was in the vastness of his relief he laughed outright
Well have to take to the boats and get back to the Pavoroso And that too is impossible for the boats are gone even to the one in which we came said the dockman energetical ly
And more evil than this has been the act of the crew senor
To the last lifebelt every means of keeping afloat has been cast overboard
It was the work of murderers and we should have understood when we saw the two chests hurled into the sea but in the great turmoil Girtons laugh had died altogether
So had Mercedess excited flood of words up to this minute continuing in spite of Patero
tremendous stillness seemed to settle on the deck of El Fuego
Do you mean to say Girton de manded thickly that this things going down and that we have no means of getting off With the shore two miles away senor Then yell cried Mr Girton
Yell like blazes for help and Patero smiled forlornly
Help from the Pavoroso
The night wind blows squarely in our faces from that quarter senor CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEED OF ALVAREZ
UST how the thing had happened Edward Hemmett could not recall but Jones was lying there at his feet senseless and bruised and very un wholesome to look upon
Canita had suffered too Canita lay huddled down by the hatch weeping queerly and appar ently unable to move and the senseless figure over there wore the cap of El Fuego as did three others who were being held by the Pavoroso scrub crew
Further Alvarez was holding his arm and saying Senor
understand but we shall settle
You would not kill the pigs with your own hands Didnt didnt finish Jones Hemmett panted as his vision cleared little and familiar objects of the deck THE ARGOSY
impressed themselves on his brain once more
No senor but it shall be done and well and What are you doing here anyway Hemmett broke in
thought youd gone with Girton It was by his order that remained behind senor Alvarez smiled and Hemmett wondered vaguely at the smile
It was an unearthly sort of expresion pallid wideeyed it suggested that Al varez was seeing visions
And we Senor Hemmett will go think to his assistance now Eh am not sure
think the Senor Girton calls for help
The wind is against them now but as it rose there were wild cries senor and much All right said Mr Hemmett
Well get over there in hurry then
Get your men together go senor
and the Alvarez smile grew more peculiar with every second
And these dogs and traitors even to the crew of El Fuego we shall bind fast that they may remain
And Polito senor and the boy of the wireless we shall take them with us and three of the fireroom force as well for know them and they are less traitors than fools Edward Hemmett stared after him as he flitted away
He had known Alvarez for many years as person of vivid en thusiasms and tremendous initiative once an idea had gripped him yet he had never seen Alvarez carry on just like that before
It was queer but meditating upon it was not nearly so pleasant as watching Alvarezs men truss up William Jones and the unspeakable Canita and the snarling members of El Fuegos crew and Hemmett turned his attention in that direction
It was solid fact that he could not remember single detail of the attack but he had certainly done thorough job on William Jones
He remembered that Carmens face and the boys had floated before him just as his fingers touched the corrupter of Guanama and that was all
And it had evidently been quite enough and to save himself Hemmett could feel no twinge of conscience
He smiled grimly and faced Alvarez just speeding into sight again
And now to go senor the younger man cried
It is to hasten think and all are ready
El Fuegos tendqr will hold us easily He led the way to the side and over it and Hemmett followed briskly enough his mind turning to El Fuego and what might be happening aboard her
human stream came after them filling the little boat and the Pavoroso for time was free to drift as she pleased
Ever and anon as he worked over the engine Alvarez glanced back at him smiling almost contentedly
Hemmett watched him and sighed once in while your excitable Guanaman goes stark staring mad under too much emotional strain
Then his gaze wandered to the scared wireless man to the fat young Polito who smoked another cigarette and gazed philosophically and contentedly ahead
Polito by the way should have been left in charge and We are here and safely Alvarez announced
And there was doubtless genuine fight waiting for them
Mr Hemmett giving over observation of his companions swung up to the deck and felt them swarming after him
Mr Hemmett came face to face with his old friend Stephen Girton and three ladies and one of them flew to Mr Hemmetts arms with scream of joy and for little he cated nothing about the impending battle nor did he even note its absence until Get the women into the tender Ned
Heaven knows sympathize but you two cant stand there and spoon all night
This tubs not going to float another ten minutes
You say senor Alvarez gasped
Were sinking and that tender ll AMERICANS AFTER ALL
have to take the women over to the Pavoroso first and then come back for the rest and great luck if some of us dont have to make the trip swimming Alvarez wrung his hands
El Fuego sinks he shrieked
She sinks
Then have He said no more
Off where the Pavoroso lay the ocean seemed to open wide and belch forth flame and smoke
roar that shook the deck and seemed fairly to beat them down came within the second and there was queer loud hiss
And the moon coming at last from be hind the cloud shone on the spot where the Pavoroso had been
There was only curiously turbulent water now with great surging white pall of smoke over head
So shall all Guanamas traitors die said Alvarez between his teeth
Mr Girtons head was just settling back on his shoulders after the blast
Youre responsible for that he gasped
With timefuse senor kindled the magazine before we left the aston ishing Alvarez cried brokenly
It was right
It was just for such as they even this death was too merciful
Yet had known Yes had you known that you were likely to drown the whole crowd by doing it you wouldnt have done it Hemmett thundered his own senses returning
Why you confounded little lunatic He choked
He felt that he too was going mad
For here came Polito stroll ing toward them cigarette and all and smiling
The vessel senor will not sink the Pavorosos officer reported placidly
The the seacocks Girton stut tered
They have been closed of course by the levers which lie in the upper balcony of the engineroom Polito smiled
Otherwise have also started the pumps which run by the aux iliary power astern senor so that in an hour or so we shall float quite easily
And by way of reaching the shore since the fires are dead and the engines flood ed we shall use the auxiliary electric gear think the storagebattery plant in the watertight compartment astern provided for the emergencies of battle
It is slow yet we shall effect landing in Parilla before two oclock believe Girton moved limply to his side
Polito he managed with queer shaky smile maybe youre youre some good after all CHAPTER XIX
PUTTING THINGS THROUGH
it admitted that Edward Hemmett even now had not readjusted him self
He had bathed and shaved and breakfasted he had slept three good hours after their return by rail from Parilla and since Fernandezs cavalry had been around the house he had slept soundly
So that he was thoroughly rested and fit for business again but the calm of Guanamas big senate chamber was almost disconcerting after the things that had happened last night
And it was calm
Gazing down from the speakers desk at the hundred or more faces Mr Hemmett reflected that never in all its history had this hysterical gathering of Latins been so utterly calm
Here and there faces were pale here and there faces smiled tried to laugh gave it up
The air was downright thick with suspense and for cause
So many things had happened since this time yesterday that sorting them out in any kind of sequence was downright impossible as yet
Alvarez the indefati gable the avenger had reported them verbally as Hemmett and Girton break fasted Alvarez had not slept and showed no signs of wanting to sleep for his country was to be saved and the two Americans served in the tremendous task that had descended upon them suddenly as any thunderbolt
THE ARGOSY
For one thing it appeared that Altara alleged President of Guanama had fled at dawn after an insane hour of bar gaining with Marado late secretary of state
The upshot of the interview had been that Marado agreeing dazedly that the recent president should not be pur sued Altara had left signed confession in his hands to be put to whatever use Marado or any one else elected
As document it was wonder
Hastily written even ungrammatical in spots
it breathed one panicstricken Guanamans desire to save himself by exposing all his accomplices nor did it lack in the definite quality for
it gave names and dates and amounts of bribes at such length that Hemmett at least all but forgot the substantial meal before him
News travels fast in Guanama
An hour after daylight Alvarez stated there had been something very like proces sion of laden motorcars making for the northern border
Puerto Carlos three morning papers were wallowing helplessly in the trough of events without editors or visible owners five of the big gray army automobiles had fought for the right of way on the first hill north of the city packed with uniforms trunks and gesticulating men
Not less than eleven senators had re signed and disappeared and it was related by Alvarez that the cruiser Almiranta had started out of the harbor had been halted by some saner souls aboard had transferred her cargo of Guanamans to the huge yacht that had followed William Jones to Puerto Carlo and it was gone leaving the navy shorter of officers as such and decidedly longer of good ones
thousand miles nearer the north pole the whole thing would have been gro tesque and impossible in Guanama it was only little more than might have been expected for when panic and fear strike into Guanaman circles they strike hard and spread more rapidly than any wildfire
And now because the senate had no speaker and Barton had collapsed com pletely when his wife returned because there had been certain strong demand this morning in influential circles that he grip the situation instantly Hemmett was sitting up here and looking at Gua namas senate while Stephen Girton at his side assorted documents pushed this one forward and then that grunted and occasionally chuckled to himself
Perhaps the most cheering document of all of them was the long official message from Washington decoded now and ready to be fired broadside into the choice little collection of legislators
The clerk was calling the roll in small hushed voice
Senators from the north the south the west and the east answered also in rather small hushed voices although here and there con sciously righteous man spoke vigorously in response to his name and even cleared his throat impressively afterward
The clerk turned toward Mr Hemmett and murmured There are nineteen more than we require for quorum senor Then well open the days business
Hemmett smiled grimly as he arose
Gentlemen Absolute attention was his in one second
The senate of Guanama has no speaker this morning Mr Hemmett went on
He is in the federal prison awaiting trial on charge of high treason
He will be shot
have taken the chair because there are things to be said which perhaps better than any one else am qualified to say
Has any mem ber an objection to offer on parliamentary grounds or any other grounds Absolute silence rewarded him
Mr Hemmett looked significantly at one Ramon Matora from the Las Almas district who rose promptly and faced his brother legislators
move that the most excellent and highly esteemed Senor Hemmett be ap AMERICANS pointed speaker pro tem by acclama tion he cried
There was no need of any seconding
One might have fancied that of all wishes that nearest the hearts of the gathering was to have the excellent and esteemed Senor Hemmett for speaker pro tem
The speaker smiled acidly
There is much business to be trans acted this morning and that in very short time he stated
It wiH be transacted in an informal manner and once matter of record it will stick
The first matter concerns the recent elec tions
We have the confession of Altara lately president that fraud governed these elections from one end of Guanama to the other
Does any one wish to dispute this statement Gravelike silence brooded over the senate chamber for long minute
Then well assume that the elections were fraudulent and if any one is contemplating disputing it later on may say that up to the time entered this chamber one hundred and nineteen election officials had been arrested since daylight and with the help of the military we hope to gather in the whole seven hundred and something before night gasp ran through the assembly
Therefore the first piece of informal business before the senate this morning will be to declare the late elections null and void to declare Senor Ferrata president for another full term and to declare illegal the election of all other officials of every sort whatsoever who came into office for the first time at the recent elections Will that stay put on vote of this kind Girton asked softly
That ll stay put Mr Hemmett assured him
The two best typists in Guanama are sitting right in the west retiring rooms with microphone receivers on their ears and reducing this stuff to print as it goes along
Before we leave this room the great seal of Guanama will have been stuck on it Stephen along AFTER ALL
with the signatures of everybody from Ferrata down Matora was on his feet again
Let this too be carried by acclamation he cried
roar of assent arose
Youre volatile obliging lot Hemmett assured them
Fiftyone of you havg just voted yourselves out of office
Will you kindly rise and walk straight out of that door
Your prede cessors are waiting to resume their seats Followed five minutes of wildest con fusion
The fiftyone having gazed at one another and doubtless reviewed the known events of the last few hours moved toward the door and through the en trance on the other side of Guanamas senate chamber entered long file of smiling welldressed unduly important brown gentlemen mustered in by Mar ado late secretary of state
This gathering together of deposed senators had been the hysterical Marados job and he had done it well
Nay he had done more for when the room began to calm down little he was at Hemmett side with bundle of papers waving his hands and speaking Observe my dear Senor Hemmett
How have labored
As ate dictated
As rode about gathering these gentle men dictated
And now
As enter the capitoi my splendid Zanape hands me these ready
How have worked for my beloved country You certainly have old scout Ste phen Girton agreed as he gazed at the papers over Hemmetts shoulder
They are in good legal form too Theyre ready for action now before somebody dynamites the senate cham ber Mr Hemmett smiled grimly
Wheres Ferrata Coming as soon as he has finished signing the official complaints demanded by the federal prison that the multitude may be legally held senor beamed Marado
Hemmett rose again
Silence came suddenly
THE ARGOSY
An act rasped Mr Hemmett
An act to expel from the navy of Guanama and from the army of Guanama every officer and enlisted man who has served less than two years and every other of ficer and enlisted man whatever his period of service who shall be unable to prove his absolute loyalty at all times past and present to Guanama The clerk read it and it was sweeping and impressive
It was indeed astonish ingly impressive when one remembered that it was Marados composition and when it had been read vote was taken and the act became law ready for Ferratas signature
And again Mr Hemmett had risen and brought down his gavel
Another act said he
An act this time to declare the National Engine Works confiscated by the government of Guanama for its own private purposes hereafter and forever and providing that the nominal incorporators of the said engine works shall receive as indemnity the official valuation they have put on the plant one million dollars United States
Its worth about thirty he added infor mally and theres no real reason for giving up that one million but it looks better The act was read
The vote was taken
Guanama had another new law
Another act continued the speaker pro tern
An act granting immunity to any resident of Guanama upon the fur nishing of permanent bond of ten thousand dollars who may confess vol untarily and in detail to his participation in the scheme by which Guanama was to have been the naval base of foreign power and further providing penalty of life imprisonment for any such resident who may not have confessed and who may be found within the boundaries of Guanama fortyeight hours after the signing of this act There was hush after the reading of this act and much shifting about
Sev eral decidedly pallid faces appeared too yet the act became law
And still another one Hemmett in toned
This act provides that to the last vessel Guanama hereby sells to the United States of America every vessel of the Guanaman
navy as it stands today in every particular and at the price named in the records of the Gua naman navy as the purchase price
For example your Almirantas down as having cost seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars as secondhand junk and thats what the United States pays for her
The fact that shes worth about six million does not figure here at all
Thats somebody elses loss but it isnt Guanamas
Get in your vote on that Mr
Clerk It came more slowly this time
There was much waving of hands and much undertone discussion but the gavel came down thrice and hard in the thick of it and they looked at Mr Hemmett and felt the power of great republic behind him
The Guanaman navy as such ceased to be
Theres rather sweeping bill re garding the character of men who shall be assigned to duty at the coast forts and the general cleaning up of European men and things in the army and political circles but that ll have to be put into better shape before we take action on it continued the speaker pro tern
So think we can come to the most important piece of work of the morning gentlemen
It is this Guanama is about to have new and new kind of treaty with the United States
With the help of the American minister well have it drafted and signed before night but the general import of it is this The government of Guanama agrees to deposit within one month the sum of one hundred million dollars with the government at Washington
Yes thought that would start you yelling smiled the speaker as he hammered his gavel
Suitable interest will be paid and the money ll be safer there than here
Should the government of Guanama at AMERICANS AFTER ALL
any future time be found guilty of plot ting against the welfare of the United States this sum becomes immediately forfeit
And further each of the coast forts will hold permanently one regiment of United States Coast Artillery supple mented by whatever Guanaman troops may be desired by the colonel of that regiment
And still further thundered Mr Hemmett who was enjoying himself hugely should the United States on proof of Guanamas continued good be havior decide to resell at cost certain of the naval vessels it is agreed that they shall be officered and partially manned by Americans
Now holler yourselves hoarse he concluded when the turmoil arose again and see what you make of it The odd thing is perhaps that when the tumult subsided saner chastened minds were in the ascendency
The terms were ratified
Guanama had been spanked
And as foreheads were being mopped and smiling men were talking to scowling men and hands were waving everywhere Ferrata president restored hurried into the senate chamber and Edward Hem mett stretched
My jobs done here Ferrata he said simply
Take your chair CHAPTER XX
AMERICANS AFTER ALL
ND so the explosion in Guanama came to an end and by evening most of the smoke had cleared away
People with too much on their minds had been leaving town all day three steamers had cleared quite unexpectedly for Europe laden down trains for the north and south had been packed too yet now quiet was upon Puerto Carlo and the residents were strolling down toward the plaza and the evening band concert just as usual talking little more animatedly perhaps but otherwise moving along quite as they had moved these many years
From the terrace of the Hemmett home the owner and Steve Girton smoked and watched them silently
They had reached the stage of weary relaxation where conversation was distasteful just now they listened thankfully to Edward the youngers pe from the upper floor smiled suddenly and waved to Carmen and Mercedes as they appeared at the window two young women rather paler than usual and not so prolific in dimples yet two who were recovering splendidly from terrible experience
The danger was over
Guanama ever ready for the psychological somersault had executed series of them this later afternoon surrounding the house within five minutes after their return cheering hailing them as deliverers of Guanama finally permitting the marine band to force its way through the howling thou sands and splitting the hot air with excited gusty discord to serenade them
Just as they had always been they were lot of children to be lured this way by white stick of candy and back again by striped one
In their lighter moments they were amusing in their darker moods Mr Hemmett shook his head as he pondered and then rose to meet his fatherinlaw Fernandez too was decidedly weary
Business men had been besieging him all day long some furiously proposing league of the righteous and blameless business element others begging hyster ically that he aid them in clearing away certain recent smudges on their reputa tions
You are national heroes again Ed ward he smiled
You and Stephen Circumstances have way of taking the taste out of that job Mr Hemmett said rather sourly
know but it was wonderful nev ertheless murmured Fernandez
You gripped the whole thing so amazingly you thrust through laws even before the sen ators could catch their breath and THE ARGOSY
Ah yes
Guanama may well be proud of you both Mr Girton smiled
Considering the time weve lived here and the money we have invested here and all the rest of it Id darned sight rather be proud of Guanama he remarked
True enough and doubtless some day you shall be sighed Fernandez
Jones ay de mi
it is not to be believed Jones is dead and Canita with him and it is said that of the corrupt fivesixths have already fled
And so Guanama is purged and purified
And you two will become citizens as you have said He waved his hands placidly
Edward Hemmett looked suddenly at Stephen Girton and discovered that Girton was eying him narrowly
And as had hap pened many times before there was no need of words between them
Mr Hem mett smiled and shook his head
Well Guanamas great little coun try he said
We owe lot to Guanama and she owes lot to us and there are lots of things about Guanama that like pretty well but guess not But Edward cried his fatherin law
Living here in business here with wives of Guanaman blood you do not mean He paused before Hemmetts steady smile
The speaker pro tern had laid hand upon his knee
mean said he and the odd emo tion of patriotism clogged his voice little that Guanamas all right and everything else is all right
But Im afraid that we Steve and well Im afraid that were just Americans after all THE END
HE first time Bronson spoke to her Sheila McNeil decided that he was unlike any man she had ever known
He had been about the office for several days great broadshoul dered fellow whose very voice was tuned to the outofdoors and as accustomed as they all were to men from the West John Bronson was man good to look upon as he went about his business
There were some of the girls who laughed at him he was not the fashion THE WOLFER
of the figure that they worshipped in their favorite movies but not so with Sheila
She knew in moment that he was the type of man her ancestors had been redblooded individuals who did not need gaudy neckties nor suede tops to their shoes to make their women love them
Their first conversation had taken place while Bronson was waiting to get into Mr Hamiltons room Bronson as was the habit of the outoftown men who were practically visitors came wan dering into the salesmanagers office and stood looking down at Sheilas fingers as they scarcely touched the keys of her machine
Some different from the way we do things in my country Sheila did not answer him at once she finished the letter and then looking up into his face asked him where his coun try was and if he didnt hate the city
Hate it He shrugged his shoul ders
No only people who live in the city hate the place
Folks like am know they dont have to stay here its lark to us Only people that live in cities hate them Sheila was thinking aloud at the same time mechanically arranging her papers for the next letter
Yes think youre right and Ive lived here forever and forever An insistent telephonebell called her then and Bronson left the room
How ever when he saw Hamilton the head of the company that was disposing of his cattle for him he asked about the little blackeyed girl who had desk
in the room at the end of the hall
Who Sheila
Why shes Philipses secretary
Philipse is head of the sales department and guess he couldnt get on without Sheila McNeil
Shes been here some time and to be truthful with you its rather interesting to me to watch those two
used to think that they were in love but guess not for Philipse has taken wife and Sheila is still Sheila
Why did you ask about her Nothing Come Bronson confess
Youve been talking to her and think shes the quickest brightest little girl youve ever seen
know Im an old man but am still able to recognize one of Gods little ladies
If wasnt afraid by the color of your face that youd propose to her and disrupt my sales department Id send for her and give you proper intro duction wish you would Bronson spoke before he realized it and Hamilton laughed heartily
will just to prevent you from put ting her over your shoulder and walking off with her
And remember Bronson shes product of civilization not cave woman from your native bad lands Hamilton pressed the button that sum moned his secretary and asked for Miss McNeil
He sat back in his chair and smiled at Bronsons efforts to be uncon cerned thinking the while that Sheila would laugh at the cattleman
Miss McNeil this is Mr Bronson Hamilton introduced them
Hes been asking about you and havent told him much
am going to let you have first advantage and say hes great big boy whos never been east of St Louis be fore in his life
Hes got cattle ranch and half million dollars good dispo sition and absolutely no knowledge of the polite way to talk to lady Oh come Mr Hamilton Bronson broke in Ill admit to part of that speech but do make objection to the end of it And so do Sheila added
You see hes spoken to me already Yes and his conscience pricked him so that he demanded this introduction Poor Bronson
His hands twisted the pencil he had picked from Hamiltons desk and he tried to hide his discomfort by smiling
Hamilton his keen sense for laughable situations photographing both expressions was thinking what splendid story it would make to tell at the club
Really its most rude of Mr Ham THE ARGOSY
ilton to make fun of you and of me Sheila said
If it werent that Id worked here for such very long time that know Mr Hamilton like almost like father Id be angry
Im very glad to have met you Mr Bronson and now Ive got to run to finish Mr Philipses work Where is Philipse Hamiltons mood had dropped in an instant and the girl responded He went to the Jersey yards to look over the new landing facilities they wrote about and on the way back hell stop at the Erie office
Hes spending the day investigating railroad conditions cheap er shipments mean cheaper deliveries Hamilton nodded
You keep close tabs on him dont you The girl replied with quick nod flush slowly creeping up over her face as she turned and hurriedly left the room
Bronson was busy the rest of the afternoon
He had much to discuss with the man who represented him in the East and had full care of all his money transactions
There were moments how ever when he thought of the little dark eyed girl in the sales department and wondered if propriety allowed him to ask her to spend the evening with him
Mr and Mrs Hamilton both of them twenty years his senior had tried to show him the town but just once he would like to go to restaurant with young woman
He did not dance at least not the dances that could be performed on the floor of the fashionable New York cafes but he wanted some one who would smile at him laugh with him and make fit ting picture for the frame of lights and colors that was called room
He was still questioning his courage when Hamilton announced that he was going home
Coming uptown with me he asked and Bronson quickly found an imaginary excuse to wait
Other nights he had been only too anxious to get away from the bewildering efficiency that was responsible for the firms success
Tonight he wanted to linger and possibly speak again with Sheila
It was almost five oclock and every where there were preparations for the end of the day before he could summon enough courage to go into the office of the salesmanager
He passed the door twice and finally entered
Sheila was there but not alone
Oh Mr Bronson come in this is Mr Philipse The two men shook hands each quick ly appraising the other
Bronson saw slender man of some thirtytwo or three immaculately dressed in rather flashy clothing
He did not trust the brown eyes that held his own for short time and then moved away and there was only contempt for the little waxed mustache
stranger in the city Philipse asked
think heard that you were to be here
How do you like it Not much Bronson said quietly
Ive seen few nice things since Ive been here and plenty that dont care for Isnt that true of every locality
Im sure should hate your native West Bronson nodded
The highpitched voice with the carefully spoken words would be laughable in the land he called home
He could not help but think of the guying that this man would get if he should ever stumble upon roundup
trust youll excuse me Philipse kept on
Ive got to sign these letters in hurry my car is waiting for me
Going up town
Id be glad to give you lift No thanks Im not quite finished for the night and Bronson crossed to the window out of the circle of light shed by Philipses desk lamp
He heard Philipse issuing orders in peremptory tone and wondered how it was that he dared speak to such girl as Sheila in that manner
Pie shook his THE WOLFER
head and looked out of the window down the canon of Beaver Street the lighted buildings looming with grandeur that was almost equal to the canons he knew
He waited there till Philipse had finished then watched him put on his overcoat and depart
dont think much of that fellow he told Sheila
Somehow wouldnt trust him much more than would snake Mr Philipse is very very clever Sheila said after second
Hes one of the best salesmen in the city Salesmen yes but if youd have said best man should have doubted the worth of your city The girl laughed
She was busy fold ing the letters her small thin fingers moving with rapidity that fascinated the watcher
You are very frank Mr Bronson most of you men who live outofdoors are brutal about telling the truth Why not
You see nature is our real mistress she never lies
wonder if youd think was too
frank if was to say that like you lot and wanted you to go out to dinner with me The girl sent quick look that went straight into Bronsons eyes
For min ute their gaze was steady and then the girl let her eyes rest on the mail she was folding
dont think ought to go Mr Bronson
You see Ive only just met you and havent any one could ask as chaperon Do they really have chaperons out side of books Bronson inquired with an amused smile
Even if they do Id like just one dinner when there would be some one to talk with that is some one Id like to talk with
Im afraid Im putting my invitation in jumble of words but wish youd eat with me Sheila laughed
You speak as if you had been lone some these past few days Lonesome
Id never thought of it in that light but guess thats the trouble
Ive been hanging about with Mr and Mrs Hamilton but theyre old and they dont hate the city
Why lady cant talk to you cant seem to say what want to but honest to goodness Ill try to be gentleman
Ive never yet had to be ashamed of the way treated woman Sheila believed him
You see the real trouble is that if were to go with you some one might think it odd You mean they might think and say something wrong of you There was aggression as well as surprise in his tone
Yes just that And youd like to go if it wasnt for what might be said Id like to go very very much
Ill be very truthful with yOu Mr Bronson and say that your invitation is very tempting and whats more Im going to accept Fine He stepped forward his face alight with boyish enthusiasm
Yes Im going to let you call for me at seven oclock
That ll give me half an hour to get home and an hour to dress
If youll have taxi Ill wear my party gown and my lovely silver slippers
See Im just as enthusiastic as can be even if have only known you few hours Five minutes later she was giving Bronson the address refusing to let him send her home in taxi
While she had been putting on her hat she wondered why she had accepted the invitation but Bronson was so much of man and Mr Hamilton had truly introduced them that in spite of what she feared was her better judgment she did not tell him that she had changed her mind
It was exactly seven when the maid announced that Mr Bronson was calling and should she let him wait in the parlor downstairs or should she bring him up to Sheilas sittingroom
Bring him up Nora Im going to let him see my green lampshade and the piece of rock that came off the Blarney stone THE ARGOSY
Nora Irish herself was laughing as she showed Bronson the way and think ing all the while that it was fine boy who was calling on Miss McNeil
Im all ready Sheila greeted him from the doorway
But Im just vain enough to ask you to come and see my rooms
When first came here to live had back room on the fourth floor but each time Mr Hamilton gave me raise got little nearer the front door and last year got these two honestto goodness rooms one flight up and fur nished them myself
Its such fun having your own sittingroom But Bronson was not looking at the room his eyes were all for Sheila
For three days he had seen her trim little miss in tiKlormade clothes but she was no longer secretary to the sales manager
She was sprite whose gar ments were blue and silver silver cord in her hair and silver shoes and stock ings on her feet
Dont eat me she laughed
Say good evening and if you look so hard at my dress Ill think theres hole in it think that that youre about the most wonderful girl Ive ever met Bronson said gravely
Hush or Ill think youre Irish and have kissed the Blarney stone
My uncle was there once he brought me back chip he picked up and kiss it most every day She left him for moment to get her coat and Bronson looked critically about the room
He was not used to womans room women never had played very great part in his life since he had been old enough to ride away from his fathers chbin
Now he looked about him at the silken draperies at the wicker furniture and at the few pictures that were on the walls
dont see how you can hate this place he said when Sheila was with him again
dont see how you could ever wish to leave it Its pretty but to me it stands for so many disappointments so many days when wished was dead
Sometimes when count the cost Id like to pile it all up and burn it Bronson did not understand and said so
Its long long story Mr Bronson
Im afraid it wouldnt interest you at all
Lets go
Im very very hungry II
It was after midnight when Bronson left her and Sheila decided that the eve ning had been decided success
They had dined at noisy restaurant where the cabaret was famous had been to see her favorite musical comedy star and then had supper at the quietest and most fashionable hotel in the city this being Sheilas choice
Still the girl was not happy for spirit of discontent had filled her
It was not that she longed for chance to live in the pleasurefilled world that she had just seen but she wished to run away from the life she knew out to the broad existence that Bronson pictured
Their conversation had been largely personal
With frank curiosity they had questioned each other as to their lives
Sheila had told about her parents her life at the convent and of going to work at seventeen
Bronsons story was not altogether dif ferent
He had started on the lowest rung of the ladder and climbed up hand over hand
Only the settings were dif ferent the stories were about the same
Sheila did not see it in that light how ever she was thinking of the little an noyances that had filled her life and of the confinement
She tried to reason it out that any existence might become monotonous after time she even tried to think that every community might hold its Philipse
Sheilas face drew into grim line when she thought of Philipse
She knew that he had been largely re sponsible for the luxury she now en joyed for as his secretary she received thirtyfive dollars week
THE WOLFER
She tried to tell herself that Philipse was only business employer that everything else between them was over
Once she had believed that to be the case but tonight how could she deny the fact she knew to be the truth
With sudden jump she sprang onto her bed and snapped out the light
Good night she said aloud cus tom that had grown on her and intended to hide her loneliness from herself
To morrows another day and who can tell Ten minutes later she was asleep and not even her dreams told her that in his big hotel room Bronson was smoking his goodnight cigar and wondering if Miss Sheila McNeil would be contented in ranch house till he could build place fitting for such lady
The more Bronson saw of John Phi lipse the less he liked him
And the more he spoke to Sheila about Philipse the more annoyed he became for she would say nothing about the man
Bronson however could see that Sheila was not happy at her work
He was trained to know sensitive horse or to guess the reason why cattle were rest less
It was this knowledge that told him Sheila was unhappy
To him she seemed frightened ani mal like his big bay horse that always shied at the Tompkins crossroads be cause of the bit of newspaper that had blown in her face the first time he drove her down that way
It was Wednesday afternoon when Bronson and Sheila first met and as Bronson explained it the following after noon he was going home on Saturday and he didnt want to lose any time in talking
He had to work during the day but his evenings were free
know its sort of rushing you but then thats what want to do he con fessed
Please dont say that cant see you tonight Sheila after minutes thought told him that he might call on her
Bronson would have preferred another theater and supper party but Sheila was firm
He could call on her for an hour or so and she would ask Miss Goode the school teacher who lived on the third floor to come in and make Welsh rabbit
Shed ask few other people and have party
You see if you dont go anywhere but to theater and cabarets youll never know what we New Yorkers are like at home so Ill just let you meet half dozen real ones the kind of people who only go to the theater once month and then sit in the balcony Bronson was willing anything as long as it meant he could be near Sheila and he hurried through his solitary dinner and then waited lonesome hour till it vas eight oclock
He was the first of Sheilas guests to arrive
If she had been sprite the night before she was Miss Simplicity this evening
Her dress was dark linen with collar and cuffs of white and her hair was twisted low on her neck giving her the appearance of country miss to whom the outsideworld is legend
Now you look like my people Bronson said in greeting not letting go of the hand she offered him
Now you look as you would if you came from the ranchhouse to meet me Sheila started and drew away her hand
suppose shouldnt have said that
Im not what you might call really cul tured and cant help being natural and saying what think And you think belong in ranch house Yes in mine but suppose youll end up by living in tenstory apart ment with some fellow like Philipse flush crept over Sheilas face
Please dont talk about him
want to be very happy tonight and forget all about everything that isnt pleasant Oh so Philipse isnt pleasant sub ject
Now look here little lady if you just say the word Ill break every bone THE ARGOSY
in that chaps body
know hes mar ried man and know he used to be kind of sweet on you
What did he do throw you over
Just say the word and Mr
Bronson Sheilas head went very high
Please remember that it isnt quite the thing for you to say that Philipse threw me over
Its its insult ing Bronson was nonplused
didnt didnt mean to be insulting he faltered
hope youll forgive me Yes under the condition that you dont speak about Mr Philipse again promise There was moment of strained si lence Bronson picked up book and turned the pages and then Miss Goode came in and eased the tenseness of the atmosphere
Even if he had promised not to speak about Philipse Bronson did great deal of thinking and as if his questions were incidental he asked Mr Hamilton to tell him something of the man
Hamilton had little to say
He was splendid salesman married his wife was sup posed to be rich and there the story stopped save for business details which were many and all to Philipses credit
At noontime finding Sheila alone Bronson reminded her that he had only one more evening in town and asked her if it couldnt be celebrated in what he termed bangup manner Sheila hesitated before answering
Since the previous night she had rather feared to be alone with Bronson
Still his very presence in the office was enjoy able
She had smiled many times at his eagerness to break every bone in Philipses body there was something about Bronson which made her feel that he would really do such thing if she demanded
Sheila did not know it or rather would not admit it but Bronson had come to mean much to her in the past two days
She was modem enough to scoff at love at first sight and yet would like to go she said simply
Only lets see something big and grip ping
dont feel like silly tinkly enter tainment tonight They chose the play and Bronson sent for tickets
Now you put on your pretty dress again and well have bangup supper anywhere you say
This is going to be an evening to remember the rest of our lives At closing time however Sheila told Bronson that they would have to forego the dinnerparty
Mr Philipse wants report got out tonight
Ill have it finished in an hour and you can call for me in time for the theater
Im sorry but the report is mighty urgent Cant it go over till morning he asked
Mr Philipse wants it mailed to night What is it dont know
He hasnt told me yet Then Im going to tell him to get some one else to do it No please dont
Just you go right along and call for me about half past seven no make it quarter past and then we can have coffee at one of the hotels and pretend we had wonderful dinner
Therell be time if you get there at quarter past Quarter past Bronson repeated sharply and went back to Hamiltons room for his coat and hat
The office was almost deserted now the latergoers hurrying with their work
He debated minute and then went to the elevator
He walked slowly the length of the block and then turned with brisker steps in the direction of Broad way
At the subway entrance he paused again
What right had Philipse to want report on this of all nights
This time tomorrow he Bronson would be speeding westward and Philipse could have all the reports he wanted unless THE WOLFER
Bronson had been used to having his way that was why his cattle were fa mous everywhere that cattle were bought and sold
Was he going to let Philipse thwart him now
He stamped his heel against the ce ment pavement and headed with brisk steps to the office
He was going to take Sheila away with him if he had to break every typewriting machine in the office
He was going to take Sheila away with him if The very thought that came to him that minute was overpowering
He laughed aloud startling two or three peo ple who were near him
He almost ran into the building his steps reeling as if be were intoxicated
He was going to take Sheila away with him
Not only tonight but for ever
What did he care for conventions
Nature demanded no chaperon and long engagements
He was natures son why should he care for manmade laws
He reached the eighteenth floor and hurried down the long corridor
The officedoors were open for horde of cleaning women had come out of no where and were busy making the rooms ready for the following day
He skirted pile of wastepaper and stepped over pail of hot water
Most of the offices were dark but bright light shone through the glass partitions about Philipse sanctum
The door was partly closed and as Bronson started to push it open he heard his name mentioned and hesitated
Im sorry you had to disappoint Bronson but then wanted to talk to you Philipse was saying
Then there wasnt report after all Sheilas voice was choked with anger
Yes report one to be settled be tween ourselves
Ive been asking you to go out with me for two weeks and you wouldnt
Yet you let this lout of plainsman tow you all about town
Whats the game Bronson shifted uneasily wondering if he had better stay concealed or whether to break into the room and thrash Philipse within an inch of his life
He heard quick movement and Sheilas voice verging on tears
Please be man enough to stand aside and let me go Go nothing youre going to stay in the corner there till you promise me youll take my terms
Ive been mighty decent to you
love you You degenerate cad
You mar ried man to talk to me like that
loved you once and you married wo man who could give you polo ponies and racingcar
Ive stopped loving you forever But never loved my wife Well at least you ought to be decent to her
If you dont let me pass this minute Ill tell Mr Hamilton the whole story in the morning and Ill tell your wife right afterward And dont you suppose could tell my story
Dont you suppose Hamilton is wise to why went to him three times in six months and had your salary raised
You poor little fool even this man Bron son knows
You say Hamilton intro duced you well Bronson wanted good time and Hamilton knew the girl to send for You know you lie The words were low moan from Sheilas heart and she reeled as if struck
Philipse moved forward to meet her but hand on his shoulder sent him sprawling to the floor
Bronsons move ments had been as the whirlwind and it was his arms that closed about Sheila
For minute there was no sound
Philipse picked himself up from the floor and his hands sought the back of small chair
Sheila was sobbing noiselessly against Bronsons coat
Well Philipse asked after min ute
He was good talker and might brazen himself out of this situation
dont give damn if what you said minute ago was true Bronson said slowly
dont believe it
It wouldnt THE ARGOSY
make any difference if it was true but its about the last rough talk youll ever pull to any woman Philipses hands gripped tighter the back of the chair and swung it few inches from the floor
Put it down Bronson roared with out moving and Philipse obeyed
Now you whitelivered snake Im going to tell you something and then Ill probably thrash your soul to hell Sheila shuddered and lifted her head
Bronsons arm was still about her and she made no effort to move from his em brace
This party makes me think of fifteen years ago when was kid and just starting out to earn my way
There were bunch of cattlemen in our neighbor hood and the wolves were bothering their calves and getting an occasional twoyearold
It was bad business and they offered me my first regular salary to kill all the pests
The Wolfer thats the name they gave me in the neighborhood and the Wolfer is what they caH me today
And you know Philipse in the last halfhour Ive come to think that wolfer is what is needed right here in this city you folks are so proud of
They need them for fellows like you
Out in my country they look on wolf as about the lowest thing God made but if theyd ever heard you tonight theyd take off their hats in respect every time they saw wolftrack in the snow Bronson moved quick step forward his hands clenched
Philipse started and his hands sought the chairback
With lightninglike move Bronson pulled the chair from his grasp
Dont kill dont Sheila cried and she tugged at the arm that Bronson was lifting to strike
He isnt worth kill ing Bronson looked from the cowering whitelipped Philipse to Sheila
guess maybe youre right
It would mess things up and weve got to get away tomorrow Philipse straightened perceptibly
Now you get and if ever see your face again it ll be just as if Id caught wolf in trap death and with one threatening shove he sent Philipse hat less and coatless into the darkened cor ridor of the office
dont know how can thank you Sheila whispered after minute
Both for what youve done and what you said About not caring whether what Philipse said was true She nodded
Once thought loved him Yes heard all that And about the money Yes and Mr Hamiltons introduc tion
He lied about me as he lied about you
Now cant we shake and forget about him He offered her his hand
She took the big hand that seemed to hide her own in its palm
Im glad you were wolfer once she told him smiling through her tear stained eyes
And now Im going to ask you to please let me off from to nights party
Im tired and Id like to be alone Bronsons face mirrored his disappoint ment
If youd rather not go he said slowly and then But before you leave me want to tell you something
Its about calf picked up once after Id shot two wolves that were getting ready to enjoy good meal
The calf had tear in its foreleg so took it home with me halfcarried it most of the way and the men the animal belonged to thought it was such joke that they gave it to me for my own
It was the first head of cattle ever owned the very first and old Mrs Calf is still living out there at Sunrise and Ive got painting of her in the ranch hallway
Now you know he stopped minute when came back here to night it was to tell you that wanted you to stop having to do things for Philipse
To tell you in good allround SOLDIERS HONOR
United States that loved you and wanted you to marry me tomorrow
And you know when beat off that wolf it made me think that That was your pet calf Sheilas tears were banished by her laughter
Bronson was crestfallen
wasnt thinking to insult you any only cant tell story the way it ought to be shouldnt have laughed
Thats the trouble with us that are Irish we laugh most of the time and sometimes at the wrong time But guess you were laughing at something funny then it must be funny to hear me tell you that love you Funny
Do you suppose old Mrs Calf thought it was funny when you half dragged her home after killing the wolves
Dont you remember that song we heard the other night When the right man comes along Sheila lifted her face to Bronsons her eyes glowing with light
You mean he asked wonderingly
mean Wolfer that well go to dinner and then Ill have to pack if were going away tomorrow night CHAPTER
MANUFACTURED BRIDEGROOM
EST POINT and FortySecond Street
An hour and half by train two separate worlds in ideals and tradi tions
The motto of West Point is Honor Valor Country FortySecond Street has many slogans but none of them is just like that
Neither is Early to bed and early to rise At West Point reveille has long since sounded and the work of the day is on at full swing before FortySecond Street has awakened to much more show of life than the rumbling of the morning milkcarts
As to being Healthy wealthy and wise well maybe West Point scores on the first count but when it somes to gathering in the mazuma or proving up as wise guys where have the soldier boys got even lookin
To tell the truth they rate in the eyes of FortySecond Street as little better than bunch of comeons
Take for instance the case of Cadet Kerr Mosely and Miss Queenie Sinclair
This Kerr Mosely mind you too was rated as some pumpkins in the corps
THE ARGOSY
He was halfback on the football team close up to the top of the list in class standing soldier every inch of him and the leader in every mischievous prank or bit of deviltry that was going stalwart redheaded young giant who could out ride outbox outshoot and outflirt any other man at the academy the idol of his fellows and terror to the tacs And Queenie Sinclair was just has been of chorus girl some people said that she had been in the first production of Erminie at the Casino way back in eighteen hundred and frozetodeath but that may have been slander she looked like cross between colored comic sup plement and the ruins of Blarney Castle
But at that she put it over this Mosely Silas seven ways from Sunday
Thats FortySecond Street for you also the fe male of the species
Not of course that the scheme was of Queenies contriving
Like most dear old grandmothers of today she was brilliant enough of hair and complexion too bril liant to be true but even Queenies best friends could never have rated the glim mer of her mental attainments at more than half kilowatt
No it was Tommy Wilburt who doped out the great idea Tommy Wilburt former pressagent but now one of those lilies of Broadway tiger lilies that toil not neither do they spin yet in some mysterious manner manage to exist
His inventive genius spurred by cer tain trenchant remarks on the part of his landlady and the knowledge that his bankroll had dwindled to one lone fish folded away in the corner of his waist coatpocket had worked out the project during the watches of more or less sleep less night and as he started out the next morning for breakfast he felt that all he needed was suitable instrument
Strange are the ways of destiny
If Mr Wilburt had possessed even so much as dollar and quarter he would prob ably have chanced eating at one
of the sumptuous places on Main Street but that single lone bone drove him to econ omy and to the Sixth Avenue bakery where Queenie Sinclair was fortifying her self with rolls and coffee for her weary daily round of the managers offices
Queenie was very much at liberty which is the polite theatrical term for out of job Even the burlesque shows and the tabloid musical comedies of vaudeville must draw the age limit some where and as one outspoken producer had told her only the day before Its broil ers were using in this show Queenie not soup stock In short she was in desperate and bitter mood ripe for almost any proposal from manslaughter down and Mr Wil burt as his eye encountered her along the line of marbletopped tables and noted the defiant tilt to her hat instinctively recognized the fact
He sauntered over and seated himself across from her
Hello kid He affected tone of glad surprise
How re they coming Queenie drew herself up haughtily pre pared to resent the advances of mere beanery patron but Tommys rather puffy face
and protuberant light eyes stirred chord of memory
Why if it aint Mr Wilburt She melted
aint saw you since that sum mer opera snap what Mannheimer took out Yes and you got raw deal that time if any one ever did Tommy pro tested eagerly
told Mannheimer he was making the mistake of his life when he canned you to put that Swede cham bermaid in for leader of the march and Canned Miss Sinclair interrupted shrilly
Never think that no stiff the size of Mannheimer ever done nothing like that to me
got better offer to join out with the Girl from Dayton company and quit him Mr Wilburt realized his mistake and hastened to retrieve himself
Just another lie of Mannheimers eh he nodded
Well dont you care kid
knock from him is always boost SOLDIERS HONOR and anyhow its all ancient history now
By the way what are you doing these days Queenie Me Her tone of careless ease was only too obviously pretense
Oh Im resting week or two
The pictures is after me hard but cant just see it
They say them studio lights is something fierce on the eyes
Then theres girl show that been offered swell part in and But Wilburt was in no humor to listen to long list of mythical prospective en gagements
Say look here kid he cut in got part that believe you can play
It aint strictly professional he glanced at her narrowly across the platter of ham and eggs which had just been set before him but theres bunch of coin to be made if its handled right The significance of that look and of his tone was not lost upon her
She hesitated moment then she twitched her shoul ders with reckless movement and gave an unsteady laugh
bunch of coin
Thats what were all after aint it
Go ahead and shoot Mr Man
Whats your layout For answer Tommy extracted news paper clipping from his pocketbook and handed it across to her
It was the story of West Point cadet who had been ex pelled from the academy for marrying
Thats what gave me the suggestion explained Mr Wilburt after he had read the story
But Queenie only looked puzzled
dont get your idea at all She shook her head
Where is there any money in getting the rollers put under cadet
Are you wise to another stunt of the kind and want me to tip it off
Is that it No no Wilburt shrugged impa tiently
On the contrary want to pull off wedding which shall be dead secret
And you Queenie have cast to be the bride She stared at him moment then with the suspicion that he was merely hoaxing her an angry red overswept the rouge upon her cheeks and her eyes took on vicious glitter
Trying to kid me are you Her voice trembled
Why you miserable rat and she reached for her cup of cof fee if wasnt too much of lady Id dash this in your ugly grinning mug you Hold on Tommy protested hastily
Im not joshing you
This is on the level Sinclair
really do want you to hook up with one of these guys in se cret marriage
telUyou theres money in the proposition Money she scoffed
Why them cadets only have fifty cents week spend ing money
know cause boarded in family once what had boy at West Point
And marry one of them
No thank you aint looking for no children to raise just at present
Besides She stopped abruptly as if checking herself in something she had been about to say
Besides she went on trifle lamely whats that old saying about catching your rabbit before you cook him
Where am going to get my cadet He picked up the morning paper which lay beside his plate and folding it over so as to disclose the headlines dealing with the ArmyNavy football game scheduled for that day passed it across to her
Where will you get cadet he re peated
Why the town will be full of them tonight and as the chances are about six to one that the Army is going to win theyll all probably be in high good humor
If you do as tell you old girl you can land any of em
But theres one in particular that Im out after He considered moment then taking back his paper made checkmark with his pencil opposite one of the names in the lineup of the Army team
Kerr Mosely she questioned as she read the name he had indicated
Wilburt nodded
What you got against him Nothing Tommy laughed except that hes the only son of old George THE ARGOSY
Mosely United States Senator from Cali fornia and generally known as the Rockefeller of the Pacific coast Now do you begin to get line on the workings of the plot little one You mean that if marry this cutie the old man will pay to get rid of me Yes to get rid of you and avoid all the scandal and publicity that would come from having his son fired
Hell come across for million And they cant do anything to me for it she demanded warily
Arrest me for kidnaping or anything like that Not chance Tommy brushed the suggestion aside with wave of the hand
This boys of full age twentythree years old
He can tie himself up to Mr Wilburt searched his imagination for something to stand as totally impossible bride but nothing occurring to him as worse than Miss Sinclair he ended by simply saying you
He can tie him self up to you and nobodys got right to question it
Besides their one effort will be to keep the thing quiet Queenie stirred her coffee thoughtfully
Give me the sketch she said
How do we land him Easy as fish for Friday
Catch him on the old chivalry gag protest womans honor and all that sort of thing
You make up for an ingenue part under stand curls and ruffles and giggles of sweet sixteen
You can do it all right
remember bit you had with the Mann heimer show that was just the type want
Only for Heavens sake tone down that makeup of yours
This doll is sup posed to be shy clinging homebody not belle of the manicure parlor You leave that to me Miss Sinclair interrupted impatiently
Get down to the action
What happens Well its like this
Youre at dance place with your cousin can get some chorus man with dresssuit to do that part of it for ten or fifteen dollars and youre just as excited as can be over the novel experience of being out at such place at night
Then come along with Mosely and stop to speak to Cousin He introduces us to you and insists that we sit down at your table Then you know this Mosely al ready broke in Queenie
Know him
But Ill make his ac quaintance today never fear and Ill manage to steer him to that dancejoint too
Dont you worry about my part of it Just pay attention to what tell you and figure on what youve got to do your self
Lets see where was at
Oh yes
Cousin introduces us and we sit down at your table
Then after few minutes Cousin excuses himself and fades saying hell be back shortly
You and Mosely have dance or two
You play up to him but not too strong understand just the sort of fluttering interest that girl of sixteen would show toward brass but tons and for the love of Mike say as little as possible
Youre regular Anna Held with those eyes of yours Queenie but you know well enough conversation aint your long suit
And now the real work of the piece commences
Cousin doesnt come back
You begin to get worried and uneasy ask what time it is and when you find it is after midnight look scared and wonder what papa will say
volunteer to go hunt cousin up and come back looking grave
draw Mosely aside and whisper that cousin has got bun on and has gone off with crowd of rahrah boys
The rotten souse say hes apt never to think of this little girl again
Weve got to get taxi and take her home So into taxi the three of us pile and speed it
up to old Dilseys house on NinetyFourth Street
Dilsey comes to the door himself in dressinggown and slippers playing the heavy parent
Whos there he snarls
Its me papa you say
These gentlemen brought me home Then you try to slip by him but he bars the way and puts up roar that SOLDIERS HONOR
makes the fathers curse in Hazel Kirke sound like Qod bless you You plead with him and we argue but we might as well talk to stone
Never shall you cross that threshold again he declares until you can do so with marriage certificate in your hand
Then he goes inside and slams the door in your face
What are we to
Youre bawling and crying telling us theres no place for you but the river and so put it squarely up to Mosely that the only honorable thing for him is to marry you
divorce can easily be arranged later tell him but in order to protect this poor childs good name and save her from suicides grave somebody must go through at least the form of wedding with her
Id do it myself say but un fortunately already have wife so it looks as if you were elected And you expect him to fall for game of bunk like that queried the chorus girl scornfully
My dear its been my business to peddle bunk around this town for many years and never yet fell down on any thing really wanted to put across
Ive seen older and wiser men than this cadet fall for stuff that was fifty times rawer than this is
No sister the one gift have is persuasive tongue and if youll only play up to your end of it Im willing to guarantee that can coax him in front of justice of the peace over in Hoboken and that youll be Mrs Kerr Mosely by this time tomorrow Again Queenie musingly stirred her cof fee
How much real money can you hold the old man up for she questioned
dont want to hear about millions but what hell actually give up Well we ought to get fifty thousand dollars at the very least averred Mr Wilburt
And how are you planning to cut it she bargained
Four ways
Equal shares to me and you and Dilsey and fourth share to the lawyer that well need to conduct the negotiations and collect the money for us Miss Sinclair drained the last of her coffee and set down the empty cup with an air of decision
Twelve thousand five hundred for mine eh she calculated
All right Tommy
Bring on your cadet CHAPTER II
THE HONOR OF THE CORPS
AS Tommy Wilburt had predicted West Point won the ArmyNavy football game that day and consequently when the victorious team returned home the following afternoon the reservation rang with shouts of exultation and long after taps were sounded the barracks still continued to celebrate its triumph the authorities for once winking at the breach of regulations
But the one man whose name was on everybodys tongue and who more than any other had helped accomplish Navys defeat took but little part in the general jubilation
Whos got the Navys goat sang out cheer leader as the hero of the occa sion appeared in the quadrangle
And the admiring corps crowding around in congratulation chorused back Mosely
Mosely Spell it out shrieked the cheer leader and five hundred lusty throats chanted in great volume of sound KERR MOSELY They would have carried him on their shoulders in their exuberance but he shrank back from the ovation and in stead of seeming gratified acted as if he wanted to run away
As soon as might be indeed he did make his escape and slipping off to his quarters where none could intrude save his faithful roommate Darwin remained there in gloomy seclusion
Hanged if know whats got into him Darwin reported to group of in THE ARGOSY
quiring comrades later in the evening
Youd think to see him that hed chucked the game for the team instead of winning it practically singlehanded
He just stands there staring out of the window with nothing more to say than particularly reticent clam
If he wasnt so allfired fit Id think he was starting in on sickness
Why just to show you how hes be having Darwin went on he got tele gram from his dad tonight
Just the one word Congratulations it was but the way he looked youd have thought it was death warrant
He went white when he read it and believed for minute he was going to faint
Then he sort of caught himself together
Oh its the game he means he muttered
Yet what else could he have supposed the old man was wiring him congratulations about Pshaw
Its probably only the effect of coming off training suggested one of the others consolingly
Ive seen fel lows go queer before because of that and Kerr has been sticking to it pretty close you know
Give him day or two and hell come around all right But day or two passed and month or two passed and still Cadet Mosely maintained that glum and repellent atti tude toward his world
From being per haps the most frankly sociable and genial chap in the whole corps he degenerated into recluse and grouch He acts to me like sort of Eugene Aram said one keenwitted chap in dis cussing the change one of those guys you know thats got guilty secret on his mind
Half the time he goes mooning along without noticing anybody or any thing and then if you happen to speak to him suddenly or unexpectedly hell al most jump out of his skin There was the more opportunity to ob serve and speculate upon the former favo rites altered demeanor because there was little else to occupy the attention of the cadets in their hours of leisure
It was bitterly cold winter that year starting in just after the ArmyNavy game in the West Point calendar every thing dates from that and lasting un broken until now late in February the river still lay sheathed in ice the snow was piled deep across the plain the biting winds of the Highlands whooped and whistled around corners and through sal lyports and the Gothic buildings showed along the spouting and eaves grotesque gargoyles and projections which the archi tect never planned
Visitors to the post were few and the ordinary entertainments of the season in consequence languished
It was dull depressing period during which both the cadets and the officers in charge of them chafed under the monotony of their rou tine
Various reckless outbreaks and esca pades on the part of the corps were natural result of these conditions and proportionately there was steady in crease to the ranks of the Area Birds those offenders against military discipline who for their sins are compelled during recreation hours to pace the quadrangular courtyard of barracks chins up guns shoulder and at quickstep
Ordinarily Kerr could hardly have escaped this dragnet and with the others would have been trudging fivehour stretch in the bleak quadrangle on Wed nesday and Saturday afternoons but this year he was too absorbed and indifferent to join in any of the lawlessness
Not so though his roommate
Dar win was mixed up in nearly everything going and although for time he man aged to evade the vigilance of the tacs was finally gathered in and given sen tence circumstance which strange as it may seem was materially to affect the ambitious plans of Mr Tommy Wilburt and Miss Queenie Sinclair
Widely separate worlds West Point asid FortySecond Street may be but just as stone cast into lake will cause an ever widening ripple that spreads until it reaches the farther shore the little inci dent up the Hudson was not to be unfelt in the land of the bright lights
SOLDIERS HONOR
So far the project of the two schemers for annexing wad of the elder Moselys wealth had been progressing as smoothly and expeditiously as even they could have desired
The lawyer they had retained an ar tist at blackmail within the forms of the statutes had already opened negotia tions with Kerrs father and the latter having come to West Point and satisfied himself by rather painful interview with his son that the marriage had actually oc curred was now bargaining with the plot ters to have the union dissolved and the whole distasteful business definitely closed up
Its plain holdup he growled to his attorney
Kerr had never seen the woman before he was introduced to her the dancehall he left her at the altar
They inveigled him into the ceremony solely through his foolish sense of chiv alry
Yet what can we do
They know that publicity in the matter would ruin my boys career
We must simply settle with the woman as cheaply as we can and then get her off to Reno or some place where this farcical marriage knot can be quietly untied The lawyer was an adept at extricating the sons of his wealthy clients from the scraps into which they managed to get
This was not the first time he had dealt with chorusgirl brides by suggesting fi nancial balm as salve for their broken hearts
But he had to confess that Miss Quee nie Sinclair coached as she was by Tom my Wilburt and the shady legal adviser was just about the toughest proposition he had ever encountered
It was Queenies last chance to play the role of trusting and deserted damsel and recognizing the fact she was deter mined to make the most of it
The lawyer had finally to report to Senator Mosely that an even was the very lowest settlement that he could effect
The Senator knitted his brows mo ment then he wrote out check for the amount and pushed it across the table to the lawyer
Some price for chivalry eh
But cant afford to haggle any longer
Tell my daughterinlaw he made wry face that the money is hers as soon as the courts have done their work But the bestlaid plans of millionaires and also of blackmailers sometimes gang agley
Papa Moselys rosy belief that he had disposed of the affair by signing that check and likewise the dream of easy af fluence in which the SinclairWilburt combination was indulging were both due for jolt
It fell about in this wise
Kerr hurry ing back to his quarters one snowy after noon was halted by one of the disciplin ary officers lieutenant named Crosby who had been his cadet captain when Mosely was plebe and against whom the latter consequently cherished an un dying hatred
Crosby was exulting over the fact that he had finally succeeded in landing the luckless Darwin among the Area Birds and he could not resist the temptation to rub it in on Darwins closest associate
Ah Mr Mosely he said with ma licious grin
just saw your wife over at headquarters having an interview with the colonel
expect youll be want ed next If ever there was case of guilty con science proving mans undoing it was then
Kerr gave start which almost split his tightly buttoned fatigueblouse up the back and turned as many colors as chameleon on piece of plaid
My wife he gasped in consterna tion
Is that woman actually here at the post The next moment he could have cheer fully bitten his tongue out for he realized from Crosbys stare of utter amazement that the other in speaking of his wife had only been using the West Point slang term for roommate
It was too late now though to recall or amend the fatal admission
The as tonishment in Crosbys fishy eyes had al THE ARGOSY
ready changed to gleam of malevolent satisfaction
So The lieutenant significantly drew his notebook from his pocket and penciled an entry
wasnt far wrong was when said the colonel would like ly be wanting to see you too
In fact guess you would better come right along with me and have your talk with him now There was no help for it
Over to headquarters Kerr was marched and ushered into the presence of that grim autocrat the superintendent
From his notes Lieutenant Crosby read verbatim transcript of the conversation which had just occurred between Mosely and himself laying especial stress upon the cadets confused and stammering re sponse to the statement regarding Dar win
As he caught the implication contained in Kerrs unfortunate slip of the tongue the colonel drew himself up sharply
Then he leaned forward across his desk his face set and severe
Cadet Mosely and his stern eyes pierced the culprit through do you real ize that this remark of yours must be in terpreted as confession confession which unless explained will necessitate the lodging of charges against you your court martial and your almost certain ex pulsion from the academy do sir Have you any explanation then which you wish to offer Kerr gulped once or twice he found it hard to speak
None sir he finally managed to an swer
The colonels frown deepened his voice took on an added tinge of hardness
Cadet Mosely ask you the direct question
Are you married man The legal procedure at West Point has crude primitiveness which would turn the ordinary hairsplitting barrister of the courts green with wonder
No objections are permitted there on the score of in criminating ones self
They ask straightout question and they expect straightout answer
Moreover they get it
They have an institution called The Honor of the Corps perhaps the most cherished tra dition of the place which prescribes that every cadet must reply truthfully when interrogated concerning his personal ac tions or behavior no matter how disas trous the results may be to himself
Queenie Sinclair and Tommy Wilburt had never heard of The Honor of the Corps and evenif they had they would never have believed it
From the view point of FortySecond Street they would have said There aint no such animal But Kerr was only too well aware of its existence and he never once thought of disobeying or evading that unwritten ob ligation
There was but one recourse left to him slight one but he decided to take ad vantage of it chiefly because the lump which kept rising in his throat at the thought of all this was going to mean to him made speaking increasingly difficult
If you please sir he said should like to reply to that in writing As you wish The colonel nodded his assent
But as he turned back to his papers Kerr from his manner was mis erably conscious that the superintendent already regarded him as an outcast and pariah
CHAPTER III
ROYALTY TO THE RESCUE
rARWIN returning cold and weary after his five hours stretch of duty in the Area entered the quarters jointly occupied by himself and Mosely to find Kerr seated before the writingtable in brown study
So absorbed was he in his somber re flections that he did not even glance up but Darwin had by this time grown ac customed to these fits of reverie on the part of his formerly lively comrade and paid no heed
SOLDIERS HONOR
Brrrl he shivered as he hung over the radiator tenderly massaging his red and frostbitten nose
Talk about the hardships of Scott and Peary getting to the pole
They didnt have anything on me
Ill bet Ive got icicles on my lungs He stood there scowling out of the window across the snowheaped plain
By George Im done he went on
Anybody that wants to flatten his feet and freeze his spine in that confounded quadrangle can do it As for me quoth the raven Nevermore Mosely roused from his abstraction and stood up
There was trace of bit terness in his faint quizzical smile
You think youre playing in pretty tough luck dont you
Why Monk it goes without saying that this was the nickname in which Darwin rejoiced Id give anything on earth just to be in your shoes
This and he picked up sealed envelope from the table is my walking papers The other stared at him incredulously
Not until he had stepped quickly over to the table and seen for himself the super intendents name on the envelope did he begin to believe
Your resignation he gasped
Well practically that
Its state ment to the supe which is bound to break me Why make it then expostulated Darwin
He asked me the direct question
told him would give my answer in writ ing
This is it Oh Darwin gloomily nodded his comprehension
He too was familiar with the obligation imposed by The Honor of the Corps Then suggestion came to him
But look here Kerr theyll never put the skids under you
Why man alive it wouldnt be common gratitude after your showing in the Navy game
Every officer in the service from the chief of staff down would let out roar
You might as well talk about firing the Vic tory monument But Mosely disconsolately shook his head
Football isnt going to save me here Monk
No nor anything else
Im married bombshell could hardly have created greater surprise and consternation
Dar win slumped weakly into chair round eyed his mouth opening and shutting like fishs without uttering sound
So thats whats been the matter with you he managed finally to articulate
Oh Kerr Kerr why couldnt you have waited just few months until commence ment and then it wouldnt have made any difference Wait
You dont imagine did this thing deliberately do you
was framed dont you understand
They caught me with my guard down and rushed me to the ropes before realized what was hap pening
Oh know its hard to believe as Darwin cocked skeptical eye at him
But its true nevertheless and whats more you or any other file would have fallen for their game just as hard as did Then he went ahead to tell how in the flush of his day of triumph he had been entrapped by the sophisticated wiles of Miss Sinclair and Mr Wilburt
All they wanted was money he ex plained and the ink was hardly dry on the marriage certificate before they had crook lawyer writing to my father to de mand settlement
He came right up here to see about it
As you may imag ine it wasnt very joyful occasion
But the old boy agreed to see me through on it
And then he groaned and sunk his head between his hands just when everything was arranged when the terms had been settled and the marriage was to be annulled and began to see myself clear of the whole rotten mess just then this sneaking quill of Crosby had to come along gloating over me on your ac count and stubbed my toe
Theres nothing to be done now he finished
The supe has put it up to me THE ARGOSY
in so many words Are you married and although Ive written him the circum stances just as Ive told them to you cant get away from the fact
cant get away from it and neither can he
Theyre bound to expel me they cant even give me the opportunity to resign
The only drop of satisfaction can get now is that the bunch of flimflammers will get left at the same time
am telegraphing the old man to call off the deal he made with them He tried to speak nonchalantly but in spite of himself his voice choked and he turned quickly away to hide the quivering of his lips
Darwin who had been listening almost in stupefaction suddenly straightened up
Hold on there he cried eagerly stretching out his hand
Maybe theres way out of the muddle after all
Ive got an idea
No listen to me as Kerr gave an impatient hunch to his shoulders
This is something that looks as if it might work
Now tell me first he went on did you take slant at that notice on the bul letin board this afternoon You mean the one about calling off all the classwork for tomorrow on ac count of distinguished visitors
Prince Chu Yang of China and party coming up to give us the onceover
Is that the one you mean Thats the baby Darwin nodded
Prince Chu Yang of China
Hes what
had in mind when told you was done with this infernal areatramping
If we can only dope out the proper formation with him Kerr all our troubles would be over that is mine would for certain and am almost sure yours would too They would eh Kerr exhibited scant enthusiasm
Well maybe so but youve got to show me
All ever knew to come from visitors of that sort was about dozen extra drills
Look how they trotted us around the parade ground for that greasy Central American presi dent last month and when the Duke DOrville was here Im not talking about any rattrap presidents or four flushing dukes or counts interrupted Monk
What you have to have for this play of mine is genu ine royal blood prince or king
When one of that sort puts up request to the supe no matter what it is hes got to grant it as compliment to the nation the guy represents dont you understand
At any rate thats what was pulled off when Prince Louis of Battenberg was here about ten or twelve years ago
The gang got next to him somehow and Louis be ing good scout in his way up and asks that all punishments be remitted And the supe stood for it Without whimper
He had to dont you see or maybe provoke what they call an international incident
Or at least thats the way Joe Phelps put it to me and he got the story from his cousin who was here
at the time Mosely began to show more lively in terest
And now youve got it in your head to tear off the same stunt eh Sure provided of course that this Prince Chewoftobacco or whatever he calls himself is really royalty
Nothing short of actual blowninthebottle royal blood will serve you hive me and Ive been bothered more or less to know whether Chink would turn the trick
Prince sounds all right of course but you cant always tell about these ring tailed titles
In Russia as understand it prince doesnt mean much more than justice of the peace Oh guess that part of it is all right Kerr thoughtfully wrinkled his nose
China is republic now believe or was up to day before yesterday but there was some sort of an arrangement made remember for the members of the royal family to keep their rank and this guy must be one of them
Prince Chu Yang of China is the way theyve got him billed on the bulletin board
Come to think of it too he ex claimed heard Cap
Blendon tell Sleeper that he was cousin to the late Emperor of China
SOLDIERS HONOR
By George Monk He flung up his head with sudden flash of excitement
If this things as you say it is we may be able to save my bacon Hold on minute cautioned Dar win
Dont start to celebrating too soon
Weve got to catch our rabbit you know before we can cook it and Im won dering just bit how were going to man age his royal highness and make him un derstand what were after
Ten to one none of the party can speak word of English Ah
Thats where your Uncle Gyrus plays trumps Kerr cried exuberantly
You never heard me spout Chinee did you Monk
Well can good enough anyhow to make myself understood
picked it up from old Hop Lee our cook out at Santa Barbara But even so Darwin still shook his head how will you get to the prince to tell him what we want How Kerr shot him glance of withering disdain
Why bawl it at him from the ranks if have to you bonehead
Never fear but what Ill get to him somehow
chance like this comes too pat to let it slip through my fingers So all that evening the two schemed and plotted to the utter neglect of their duties and when at last the bugle sound ed Lights out Kerr retired firm in the belief that the problem had been solved and feeling as if the load of care he had been carrying for so many months at last had fallen from his shoulders
Did any uneasy forebodings trouble his pillow that night warning him of the con sequences of his proposed action conse quences that were to lead him halfway around the world and test his fiber in the fire of great experiences
Truth to tell no
The routine of day at West Point with its rigorous grind is hardly conducive to visions either pro phetic or otherwise
slumbering young giant Mosely lay there on his narrow army cot deep breathing oblivious to both his past and his future while destiny perched on his footboard and waited for the day
CHAPTER IV
theres many sup
VEST POINT prides itself on always being prepared
Less than twenty four hours notice had been given of the impending royal visit yet at noon when the party arrived arrangements had been completed covering every detail for the proper reception of the prince his daugh ter the Princess Chu Sing who accom panied him and the various members of their retinue
Kerr Mosely painfully bugling cadet slang for stalling at recita tion in mathematics felt his heart leap with thrill of excitement when he heard the rap of the professor calling halt for the dismissal of the section and the subsequent announcement that all mem bers of the corps donning full dress were to hold themselves ready for immediate assembly
In spite of the notice on the bulletin board Kerr had been haunted with anx ious fears lest something might happen to interfere with the coming of the party but now with the assurance that the prince had actually arrived he shot glance of purposeful significance at Dar win and his heart beat high with spirit of adventure
Colonel Vance the superintendent rigged out in all the regalia of his position chapeau goldfringed epaulets and clanking sword and surrounded by his equally glittering staff met the distin guished visitors at the station and extend ed them ceremonious welcome
Then as the cannon roared out royal salute they were escorted up the hill where the corps was drawn up long gray line in front of barracks present ing faultlessly as the cavalcade whirled by
Standing at rigid attention Kerr scanned the impassive Oriental faces of THE ARGOSY
the prince and his suite as they stared phlegmatically about at the gray battle mented buildings and the sparkling sweep of snowcovered plain
Out of the corner of his mouth he whispered to Darwin who stood next him Dont seem to be much difference in looks does there between royal Chink and one of the ordinary washeewashee variety he commented
There isnt Darwin responded with assurance
All Chinks run in one of two patterns either fat and greasy or skinny and dried up
Dont you remem ber piping off the members of the Chinese embassy when we were down at the in auguration at Washington
No you dont need to be afraid of bracing this prince tell you
Just make yourself think youre talking to some old laundry man There was no chance to say more at the moment for with the conclusion of the salute the battalion was relieved until the time set for an exhibition drill later in the afternoon all except the members of the Third Division who were ordered to shape their rooms immediately for special inspection by the visitors
Kerr and Dar win being among those so designated hurried off to busy themselves with broom and dustpan in tidying up
They had expected this and never had they gone at the distasteful chambermaid work of their joint establishment with such zest and anticipation for upon the forthcoming inspection they were basing all their hopes
That had seemed to them the propitious moment for preferring their request to the prince and they had rehearsed again and again the scene they expected to be en acted
Knowing the custom of visitors on such occasions they never doubted but that the prince would make some comment or ask question regarding the arrangements of the room
He might address the cadets directly although they believed it more probable that he would speak through an interpreter
In either case this was to be Kerrs op portunity
He would give the answer in Chinese and the prince surprised and in terested at hearing his own language spoken would hardly fail to pursue the conversation and thus afford an opening for broaching the allimportant subject
Indeed it seemed to the two cadets that no possible bar could now arise to the complete success of their project
Every circumstance was in their favor
The Chinese from the time of Li Hung Chang down have been given to asking ques tions at every opportunity and so infre quently must it be that the prince heard himself spoken to in his own tongue that Kerrs use of it would almost certainly stir him to feelings of goodwill
And now the footsteps of the party could be heard upon the stairs
Hastily the two assumed an attitude of rigid at tention as they awaited the expected knock upon the door
Kerrs breath went little faster and he involuntarily braced himself for the ordeal
The footsteps were at the very threshold now
But there was no knock on the door
Without pausing the party passed on down the corridor
Blankly the cadets stared at each other
For some reason or caprice they could not tell why possibly from the sheer mal evolence of fate the superintendent had chosen not to show their quarters
Maybe theyll stop in on their way back ventured Monk hopefully al though his lips were pale
But Kerr only shook his head
He sank down miserably in chair and buried his head in his arms
Their chance was gone and he knew it
His was not nature though to cry long over spilt milk or to languish in de feat
Indeed when he dropped his head into his arms it was lessin token of sur render than to review the situation and to ponder what steps next to take
And now he straightened up suddenly his jaw set glint of determination in his eye
By Jove Im not going to fess out SOLDIERS HONOR
like this without getting even lookin he declared hotly
Where theres will theres always way
Monk what are the orders for the day Exhibition drill this afternoon
There go the bugles for it now
Then tonight theres reception at the supes house Ah Kerr exclaimed
reception eh Yes but thats for officers only
No chance to horn in there
dont know old man but what our only hope is to shout out an at the prince from the ranks as you first suggested No Mosely shook his head as he struggled into the sleeves of his overcoat
America first my boy
We mustnt let these foreigners get the impression that there is any ragged discipline here
Be sides it would only prejudice old Choo choocars against us
These Orientals are great sticklers for etiquette and ceremony you know
No he repeated Ive got better scheme than that
Invitation or no invitation am going to that recep tion Accordingly there was no disturbance or undignified interruption in the exhibi tion drill to which they now betook them selves
With the rest of the battalion Kerr and Darwin sloshed around through the snow of the parade ground in series of evolu tions which caused the somber eyes of the Chinese prince to lighten with gleam of wonder as he admiringly clapped his gloved palms
The shy fawnlike little Princess Chu Sing wrapped in her furs also applauded daintily
With Asiatic reserve she showed nothing that was in her mind but down in her heart she thought she had never seen more inspiring sight than these sturdy young sons of Mars
And when they passed in review company front with lines as straight as ruled edges her brown cheeks glowed with an irre pressible touch of color and the breath came fast between her parted lips
After the drill was over and along to ward dusk gentle south wind sprang up bringing with it distinct moderation in temperature
At about the same time lights began to glow out from the windows of the superintendents residence and busy preparations were in progress for the evenings entertainment
How the ensuing complication occurred no one afterward was able to determine
It is grave misdemeanor to tamper with the guard roster of an army post and cer tainly not one ordinarily apt to be at tempted for the purpose of hogging extra duty
Yet strangely enough when the commandant that evening instructed the first sergeant of company to de tail cadet as special sentinel for the superintendents quarters during the hours of the reception the name found deco rating the top of the roster was that of Cadet Mosely
It was quite out of order Kerr belong ing properly almost at the foot of the list but the first sergeant was rather dense youth slave to routine perhaps that fact had also been reckoned on and when he saw the name there that settled it
The assignment assured Kerr prepared for it with the best his division could fur nish
pair of new trousers was requi sitioned from plebe whose waist measure and length of limb approximated Moselys own Darwin contributed dresscoat with prayer that the seams might hold some one else gave shako and the various remaining articles of ap parel were borrowed from other rooms along the corridor either with or without the consent of the owners
If one is pos sibly to hobnob with royalty one wants to put ones best foot forward even though it is in another fellows shoes
So thus accoutered and with the cape of his gray overcoat thrown jauntily back to show his emancipated status as an up per classman Kerr emerged from bar racks and strode across the quadrangle
Nine oclock found him at the superin tendents door and regular answered his ring
Inform Colonel Vance that Cadet Mosely reports as ordered With mili THE ARGOSY
tary punctilio he brought his gun sharply to an order The soldier vanished and in few min utes the colonel resplendent in gold lace appeared
But the dazzle of the colonels raiment was not reflected in his counte nance
He seemed perplexed annoyed perturbed
Kerr however paid no heed
Erect as Darwins straining dresscoat and the corset of West Pointer trunkmus cles trained to the quality of whalebone and tempered steel could make him he riflesaluted
Cadet Mosely reports sir as or dered Mr Mosely did you say peering at him from under bushy gray eyebrows
Even yet the superintendent appeared in credulous
Yes sir briskly
had hardly expected to see you The superintendent bit his lip in inde cision
It was most irregular that cadet who was practically under charges should be acting as sentinel
Yet to go through the red tape necessary to secure substi tute at this late hour would be impracti cable and anyhow he had dozen other things to look after
As he debated the question he raised another issue
May remind you Cadet Mosely that the communication you promised in answer to my question of yesterday is not yet in hand Kerr had rather expected this and was prepared
Reaching inside his blouse he drew out the letter he had written the day before and handed it over
The colonel started to tear open the en velope then paused and held it thought fully in his hands
Mr Mosely if this should contain what fear it does should be forced to order you under arrest and that would necessitate my securing another sentinel
Consequently shall leave it unread until tomorrow He turned and laid the letter away in the drawer of desk which stood there in the hall
Kerr could hardly repress gasp of re lief
That had been the one weak spot in his scheme the moment he had feared and now he had surmounted it success fully
The rest would be easy sailing
Yoif will continue your detail there fore proceeded the colonel curtly
Take your post on that short walk He pointed to gravel path which ran along the side of the house
At the order Kerrs burgeoning elation evaporated like cloud of steam struck by sudden current of frosty air
It had been his idea that he would be stationed at the front door where even though he failed to encounter the prince himself he was almosf certain to gain speech with some member of the suite either going in or coming out
But off at the side where there was no chance of meeting any one but kitchenmaid or one of the caterers men he might as well be in his own room at barracks
You will remain on duty went on the colonel pitilessly until after the re ception is over and under no circum stances are you to allow any one except my own domestics to pass you
Those are your orders
Do you comprehend them do sir Mosely dejectedly saluted
He was too overwhelmed to hear slight rustling on the stairs overhead or to notice two shadowy feminine figures watching the in terview from the landing
Then take your post directed the colonel
And with another faltering salute Kerr obeyed
CHAPTER WHO GOES THERE
TREARILY Cadet Mosely began to pace his gravel walk between its two banks of melting snow
Gradually however he becrme interest ed in spite of himself in the brilliant com SOLDIERS HONOR
pany gathered within the house and plainly visible to him through the parted curtains at the windows
The prince did not especially impress him being of that pattern of Chinaman which Darwin had described as skinny and dried up and like the gentlemen of his suite attired in American evening dress with only broad yellow ribbon to indicate his rank
The princess and her ladies in attend ance on the contrary were in native cos tume and proved far more satisfying to the critical eye of the observer on the walk
Indeed Mosely always suscep tible youth might readily have lost his heart to the delicate little ivorytinted lady who looked as if she might have stepped out of fan had it not been for the surpassing charms of one of her fair associates
This girl showed scarcely trace of the Mongolian characteristics
Her brows were arched not slanting her complexion as exquisite as the flush upon briar rose her profile chiseled like Hebes
Her eyes were dark and met those of any one who spoke to her openly and frankly not with the shrinking deference of the Oriental woman
In short she was girl of today love ly laughing wholesome unaffected
She wore short jacket of brocaded ivory silk fastened with buttons of carved jade and caught by curiously set pearl pins and skirt of heavy satin of the same shade reaching hardly to the ankle dis playing underneath the goldfringed pan taloons and tiny embroidered slippers
Her hair worn low over her ears and under net of gems only served to ac centuate with its hint of an unchanging fashion the difference between her and her companions
Some femme that muttered Kerr slowing up in his stride to gaze upon the entrancing vision
guess it would go bad to have her up here in the summer time and take her for stroll around flirtation not He halted suddenly jealous frown creasing his features as he saw her talk ing and smiling up into the face of the despised Crosby
What can she see in that rotten quill he snarled disgustedly as the two sauntered away together out of sight and he resumed his solitary pacing
Eleven oclock came and with the band striking up The Star Spangled Banner the company inside formed for gala entry into the ballroom the colonel and his royal guest leading the van
Outside the lonely sentry fairly dragged his feet striving not to keep step to the music and choking down the lump which the familiar refrain brought to his throat for rail as he would at the mis eries of cadet life there was bitterness in his heart at the thought of leaving the gray old academy with its many fond as sociations and he was more than loath to give up the military career to which he had dedicated himself almost since the time he had laid aside pinafores
Yet it was useless to repine
He knew that he was marked for expulsion as in evitably as that tomorrows sun would rise
And what would his stem old father have to say to this final outcome
Ah that was question on which the cul prit did not dare to reflect
With head down engrossed in his moody meditations he lagged up and down the stretch of gravel walk oblivious to everything save his own troubles until suddenly the sound of soft footstep and the sight of two figures looming up dimly almost directly in front of him brought him to recollection of his duties
Halt he challenged throwing his gun viciously to port Who goes there And then he almost fell over backward for as the moon sailed from under cloud he saw laughing out at him from muffle of wraps the face of the Antipo dean divinity at whom he had gazed through the window while close behind her equally shrouded was the figure of the little princess dainty shy and lovely
To Be Continued
Small Town Tragedy
AY what do you want with all these shirts Walt Harry Anderson owner of the lit tle store on High Street wrapped three silk shirts in blue paper and handed them across the counter to his old school friend and pal Walter Leeds who worked at Canning Brothers the seed store farther down the street
Not possible you didnt know Mildred Race is coming back today is it Mr Leeds tucked his package under his arm and added And anybody workin in big store like Wells Wells in New York will be some swell dresser take it from me
Shell be used to fellows wholl know what to wear and when
She shook me to go to the city and now Im aimin to let her know Im not so slow if did stay in Wedgely Anderson grinned and swung himself jauntily to seat on the counter
Ahha that explains the white flan nels the barrels of ties the oodles of shirts the marvelous assortment of socks he exclaimed
Come to think of it though Ed Brown did say Mil was some babydoll Sure she is but she wont outdoll me
And when she compares her hometown sweetheart with those city guys that trot her to cabarets every night dont intend to retire behind the tall grass on the farm
Some line of stock you carry old top Yep all the latest
Its payin pretty well too
Decent of Mil to spend her va cation here with the old folks aint it added Anderson as he followed his friend to the door
Oh Mils all right
Well so long So long II
The express from New York paused beside Wedgely station where several hacks were drawn up at the platform
One rather smartlooking car and run about driven by girl in middie com pleted the scene which greeted the slim little maiden who sprang from the second GLAD RAGS
car almost into the arms of Mr Walter Leeds who was wonderfully got up in the very best that Anderson Gentle mens Furnishings could produce
His ruddy face glowed above pale pink silk shirt which was adorned by string tie of deeper pink whereon re posed as though but transient guest large golden fly with ruby eyes
The rest of Mr Leeds was encased in white duck trousers black silk stockings and white canvas shoes
But he thought proudly he had nothing on Mildred
Mildred Race was small and thin with the flatness of board and she wore green silk sport suit high white shoes and Panama hat with green band
Her blond hair came down on each pink cheek in flat ring and in some mysterious fash ion remained there
Long pearl earrings dangled from the ears that were hidden somewhere behind the misplaced hair and pair of limp doeskin gloves hung in one little hand
Mildred Race was the living definition of chicken queen babydoll and some kid She almost bowled Walter Leeds over
Gracious Walt youre lookin grand she told him with languishing glance from under the dark lashes
Get em to take my trunk up will you
Theres love
Heres the check When they were seated in the
hack Walter procured she appeared eager for news of the old crowd and apparently oblivious flf her escorts presence pro duced vanity case as he talked and powdered her nose moistening one finger and passing it over brows and lashes
Dont look so fussed Walt she gig gled when she caught his stare of amaze ment
Everybody in town does it these days
You see were all so busy and so rushed we dont get time of finish at home
Too bad you never got to see me Walt its some little old town It must be said Walter Leeds with long breath
wish Lelia could have come with me
She shares my room at the boardin house sighed Mildred
Gee you ought to see her Walt
Shes class you bet
Dif ferent fellow every night in the week and clothes
My that girl is clever
She makes all her own clothes and some of mine
She made this She did Words failed him
Are they wearing many er things as gay as that Gay with fine scorn
For the love of Pete
This is deep mourn ing besides some of them
But the really swell ones cost too much money yard couldnt go the price
But wait until you see my summer furs
bet every girl in Wedgely would faint if she knew the glad rags Ive got in that little old trunk
Say Walt do they have those dancing contests out at the White City yet on Friday nights Yes want to go tonight
The bunch is going and we sort of hoped youd want to Sure Ive been dancin every night in New York
Is that Steve Farrel over there Walt Yes tall cleancut young fellow in work ing clothes passed them with nod and wave of his hand and Mildred Race looked after him with wide eyes
Dont he look awful in that getup
Is he still at the works Walt Yes says he wont quit until he knows it all from the bottom up Looks as if hes liable to then she giggled
Hes awful good lookin though Yes but our bunch has sort of let Steve alone since he began that sort of thing and Mr Leeds flicked bit of dust from his pink silk sleeve with polished fingernail
Mildred Race stared across the pretty street long silent moment her fingers absentmindedly crumpling the doeskins
Cant pay you for these now old top but let em go on the bill wont THE ARGOSY
Ive got to dress up to Mil
Gosh you oughta see the glad rags shes got in her trunk Walter Leeds leaned confidentially over the counter of Andersons haberdashery store and wiped his perspiring brow with fiftycent handkerchief sporting an elegant palegreen border and huge green in one corner
saw her last night talkin to Steve Farrel out at her gate grinned Ander son folding up one skyblue tie and one salmon one
She was some little looker then believe me
Had on kind of white and red thing pretty near as short as bathing suit
noticed it more because Steve had on that old suit he wears to the works all over paint Yep shes looker Mr Leeds stared absentmindedly at box of purple bordered handkerchiefs marked six for thirtyfive cents
But shes got no time for Steve not the way he looks
Funny he dont seem to care goodlookin boy like him too
But paint joints no place to be gentleman in Harry
He ought ave gone into the seed business maybe it dont pay so much but gosh its refined
Miss Mildred Race came out to the porch that evening when Mr Leeds called in pink sport suit made extremely short and extremely full and while the neck was cut very low in the sleeves came al most over the little hands
Her blond hair brought down over her ears lay flat to her small head and was built out in thick knot midway between her neck and the top of her head
She sat down on the step beside her caller and for once made no remark about his new flannels or his shirt which always challenged attention whether of the ad miring variety or otherwise
Her manner was graver than usual and her eyes rather wide and wistful
Gee Ill miss you Mil when you go back Monday Mr Leeds sighed pres ently and lifted one freshly blancoed shoe to the step beside her meanwhile resting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his palm as he had seen Francis Bushman posed dozens of times
This towns slow enough anyhow without fellows havin special reason for thinkin it is Oh dont know its not so bad She drew long breath and moved the hand he was groping for
Say Walt Steve was tellin me his mothers sick Yep got rheumatism cant get out of bed
Steves got housekeepin down fine they say But who cooks for him them when hes so busy
Wheres little sister Old Julia our washwoman cooks for them when they can get her
guess Steve manages he dont fuss around much with girls or anything
Little sister Lola is well guess that kid is worryin Steve lot just now
Shes been goin around with some fat drummer and they say hes got wife
Steves dead crazy about Lola too Mildred did not reply and presently Walt moved again restlessly
You didnt say whether you liked this shirt or not he ventured
Aint the socks dandy match Fine Have any of your city beaux got any thing on me when it comes to dressin Mil Not thing Walt
You look just like some of them Gosh New York must pay good sal aries he muttered ruefully thinking of his debt to Harry Anderson
And what would he do with all the truck when Mildred was gone
It was darned nuisance dressing up every day and as for matching shirts and ties and hose and handkerchiefs goodnight
Well all go out to the White City Saturday Mil he said then nettled at her unusual abstraction
The bunch will go want to Sure anything Walt IV
Mil and Steve are gettin thick Walt Anderson teased some days later when Leeds dropped in at the store after GLAD RAGS
She dont seem to care how he looks
Met em walkin toward the plant ten minutes ago
She had on middie no class to that is there Oh guess guess shes glad not to dress up in the mornings like she has to in town said Mr Leeds weakly
She was class enough last night
Were goin to the White City tonight
Cant Nan and you come along
Ill settle that little bill Harry as soon as Dont let that worry you Walt your credits good grinned Anderson good naturedly
Sure Nan and Ill go along
See you at School and High at eight Yep guess so
Ed and Bess are going too
Gosh Ill miss Mil when she leaves Cant you persuade her to stay in Wedgely Walt Ive tried to ask her twice but she wouldnt let me sighed Mr Leeds
Im gonna try again tonight Sure thats right never say die Mrs Race Mildreds stout mother came to the door that evening when Wal ter called for her daughter
aint no idea where our Mil is Walt she told him peering up and down the street
She aint been in since right after supper
My dont you lookgrand
And she didnt tell me where she was off to
Will you set spell and wait Walter Leeds mystified and bit hurt set spell in stiff rocker in his white flannels his navyblue coat and tie and hose and twiddled his straw hat with its navyblue band
Presently when his watch told him it was ten minutes to eight Mildred Race came down the street slim white fluttering form between the bars of moonlight and the velvet shadows the great trees threw
She had on little demure gray dress and palepink silk sweater and she was breathing rapidly one hand on her breast
My stars Walt if had weak heart Id drop dead at your feet she giggled leaning agaiiftt the vinetwisted pillar near him her face flushed prettily
did some Marathon believe me
Knowin you were on the point of suicide
Wait until get hat and powder my nose and well run right along And she was gone like flash into the house before Walter could voice the ques tion he had some right to ask
On the way to the trolley he asked it
Oh said Mildred carelessly
dropped in on one of the girls
Gee Walt is that Nan Dawson with Harry Anderson
Got the contour of cushion hasnt she
If ever come to that Miss Race drew long breath and hitched up the fluffy white furs closer about her little rounded chin
Youll never come to that said Wal ter Leeds with finality as they reached the other couples standing at the cor ner of School and High Streets
The White City was much as other white cities mostly yellow glitter
Per ilous dips and paths outlined in flaunting lights against the skies here the swaying enticing music of the Habanera from Carmen there the more enticing notes of the latest fox trot and over to one side little artificial lake outlined in light and decorated by various rowboats and launch or two
Among those who trotted untiringly at ten cents trot were Mildred Race and her crowd Mildred had not been herself according to her escort all the evening
She was quiet and abstracted even her feet forgot themselves now and then and when that happened Walter grew really perturbed
Something must be wrong
He felt vaguely angry with Mildred in that she was not exerting herself to make his eve ning pleasant
After all he had spent on his clothes for her sake Holy smoke
girl had right to laugh when man said something smart anyhow
Lets go have soda Walt Mildred suggested right when he was noisily demanding another encore
Dont you want the rest of this he began but she was threading her way through the swaying couples to the door
Sick Mil THE ARGOSY
She threw him flashing smile the first he had seen that evening
Gee Walt youve got pace that belongs to New York she grimaced saucily
Here comes the bunch
Im askin Walt for soda Ed and he dont want to buy me one
Whadda ya think of that Among the couples who sat at the mush roomlike little table in the openair re freshment parlor was slim dollfaced girl who was plainly not over eighteen and stout grayflanneled party old enough to be well very big brother at any rate
The girl was pathetically pretty with the big eyes and tiny mouth that belong to youth eager to learn but wistfully afraid
The man was desperately at tracted and very attentive and the girl looked at him now and then and flushed prettily
Mildred Race had not put her spoon in her ice cream soda before she saw them
Walt she pinched Mr Leeds sharp ly below the elbow
guess thats Lolas drummer aint it Walter Leeds remarked the curiously tight look about her pretty mouth
Sure it is theyre everywhere
Hes rushin her
Everybody says his wife ll get on and then Whats his name asked Mildred
Dawson believe
Whats the mat ter Mil Why the devouring interest in the stout party Mildred added Harry An derson leaning across the table
Does anybody know where hes from Mildred asked her eyes still on Steve Farrels little sister
Sure Buffalo Where you going demanded Walter as Mildred rose pushing away her soda
Ill be back in minute she nodded
Im going to get that little babydoll and take her home And before her party could voice any protest or do more than stare at one an other she was halfway over to the other table
How are you Mr Dawson she be gan cordially her hand extended You dont know me but Ive met your wife shes shown me your picture often enough for me to recognize you right off and Mr Leeds told me was correct
We make lot of strangers here in Wedgely you know its our way
And then having met Mrs Dawson oh hello Lola The fat drummer was on his feet very red of face mechanically pumping Mil dreds slim hand up and down
Lola Far rel was staring at him with horrified eyes
Mildred youre wrong Mr Dawson isnt married she got out primly through her pretty tremulous lips and Mildred laughed musically
Nonsense Lola know Mrs Dawson very well
visit in Buffalo Mr Dawson Apparently the stout drummer had had no idea of denying the calm statements of this breezy cordial innocenteyed young woman and he just as apparently had next to nothing to say
Why you you were asking me to marry you cried Lola rising excitedly
What did you mean
Answer me are you married Come Lola deary you come home with us soothed Mildred Race putting an arm about Steves little sister fondly
Of course Mr Dawson is married know his wife didnt you hear me say so
Tell the little girl youre married Mr Dawson Dawson stared suspiciously at Mildred Races smiling face and somehow under her smile he sensed something he distinct ly did not like
Why er was just kiddin you along Lola he tried to grin
Of course Im married
meant to tell you when Thatll be about all from you cut in Mildred sharply and now she was not smiling
And Id advise you to walk while theres nothin behind you to make you run
Ive got some perfect gentle men with me over there who might be bit interested in your immediate de parture and as for this kids brother well say GLAD RAGS
Mildred paused dramatically and Mr Dawson seized the opportunity and his hat itnd walked hastily out upon the crowded promenade
Lola caught Mil dreds arm convulsively
Oh Mildred he was asking me she began hysterically but Mildred patted her shoulder
Didnt time my entrance just right
Now you come right over with me and after Walt buys you sundae and me some more ice cream for guess what left is now mere soup well all take you home deary where you ought to be cookin for your mother and Steve
Im not goin to read you any sermon Lola Farrel but your place is surely in the home from now until your mother can walk and then some The following evening when Walter Leeds called on Mildred Race he knocked vainly upon the screen door and at last sought out her shambling father in the back yard
Mrs Race washing the dinner dishes came out at the kitchen door in big soiled apron
Land is Mil gone again she de manded
Father dont you know where Mils went to
She was on the porch while back Walt
Dont you dress just fine these days
Come in and set spell do But Walter Leeds had set his last spell waiting for the truant daughter of the house of Race and he withdrew after an aimless inspection of old man Races vegetable bed and glance at his watch whose hands pointed maliciously to ninethirty
Mildred had know he was coming to night and he was angry and hurt
She had given him the shake after all he had spent on clothes to make hit with her
It would take him months to crawl out of debt he would have to forego lunches and cigars
That was fine way to treat fellow
And she was taking mighty big interest in the Farrels biggest fool thing he ever saw taking Lola Farrell away from that fat drummer and bring ing her home last night
The bigeyed kid would find another drummer
Why was Mildred Race so darned interested
The bunch would talk about it for month
Could it be that Steve Farrel
Here Mr Walter Leeds in his spotless flannels paused moment in the quiet street and laughed aloud and scornfully
That guy in his paintsplashed old brown suit
After the sports Mildred Race had tearing around after her in New York after him Walter Leeds who had outsported any of those city dudes in this one dazzlingly extravagant week

He was walking moodily past the Race house the next evening early when Mil dred came running down the path to him
She wore the middie Harry Anderson had spoken of and the earrings were not in evidence
Oh Walt you must be furious at me
she gasped when she reached him
She laid one small hand on her throat and the other on his arm looking at him appealingly from under those long lashes
Ma says you are but told her we were too good friends for that
All these years little thing like that little thing All his hurt was in the three words
Mildred where were you last night Down at Farrels Walt

SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTERS ALREADY PRINTED
ARDEN BROOKE young farmer has recently been appointed justice of the peace for Bells ville near Linhampton
Sam Vane after capturing thief in Brookes woods hands over to Brooke the booty valuable jewelry stolen from the home of Dr Bates in Linhampton which Harden stows away in his attic for safekeeping overnight
Meanwhile he hires tramp Claude Miller as farm hand but in the morning Miller is missing and in the attic near the spot where he has concealed the jewels Harden finds lying unconscious Letha Severly pretty school teacher who boards with Harden and his sister Marion
She says man has frightened her in the night but insists that it was not Miller
Brooke tries to get on the trail of the latter through telephone Central and meanwhile drives in to Linhampton seeking other clues but does not dare admit he has lost the jewelry committed to his care
Thus he is set into panic when on his way home Raymond Bates hails him to say that he is going to motor out to Brookes place to identify and check up the jewelry in order to set his mothers mind at rest
CHAPTER BARGAIN OFFER
HILE Harden Brooke had his own troubles this morning Miss Letha Severly calmly conducted the studies of about score of boys and girls at the little schoolhouse half mile from the farm
There was nothing in Lethas appear ance to Suggest that she had passed through terrifying experience during the night which might well have excused her absence from the school
In her well fitting dark gown relieved by touch of white lace at throat and cuffs and with her shining Titian hair in perfect order she was quite as charming and efficient as usual and the morning session moved along with its accustomed smooth ness
No one saw any difference in teacher At noon there was the usual recess and she had the room to herself while the rampant crowd of youngsters after consuming their lunches played about outside
She had just disposed of her own sand wiches and cake put up for her by Marion and had stepped to the window to gaze thoughtfully across the fields at the farmhouse which had suddenly be come the scene of so much mystery when the door opened and heavy footfall made her turn
She felt resentful at once toward the man who stood before her
She did not like his white eyelashes nor his smirk This story began in the May Argosy
THE ARGOSY
nor his short nose nor his eyes that were too close together
His citymade check suit was too loud and his yellow low shoes with their sprawling silk laces and thick soles were an offense
With quick feminine ap praisement she judged him to be not more than thirty
Miss Severly he interrogated re moving his straw hat with what he evi dently meant to be courtly flourish
Yes Ah He coolly turned the key in the door and waved one hand toward the window while he slicked down his light hair with the other
Softie of the kids might want to come in he explained and have some thing important to say Letha still stood near the window which was partly open
If the stranger had expected her to betray emotion at his words or apprehension because he had locked the door he was disappointed
She calmly waited for him to go on
My name is Marcus Tolman
am in the law office of Strike Boxall in Philadelphia
When John Landon was charged with stealing five hundred dol lars from the cashiers office at the Im perial Market where he was employed three months ago handled the case for the firm
Landon got away
We know that he took the name of Claude Miller
have succeeded in tracing him here to Bellsville Well did not get here till late last night and made the mistake of not arresting him as soon as found out where he was
When went to Harden Brookes house this morning found he had skipped
It looks as if he might have been tipped off
Brooke could not tell me anything about him
didnt tell him that Landon married your sister
But knew you were teaching school here and naturally came to see what you have to say What do you expect me to say she asked icily
Oh now Miss Severly whats the use
Ive got the goods on Landon and dont think it would be hard to prove that you helped him to get away from that farmhouse last night
know you had letter from Philadelphia yesterday afternoon and Im guessing that you were told was coming and were asked to give Landon word of it if you saw him Your guesses are interesting
But have no comment to make
If this is all you have to say Ill She finished the sentence by walking past him quite unhurriedly and unlock ing the door
Dont open the door yet he re quested his smirk wider than ever
Ive only told you part of what Ive come to tell
Youll find the rest of it even more interesting than my guesses
It may be chance that has brought you and John Landon to this place but am lawyer and have way of putting this and that together have to open the afternoon session of school in few minutes she inter rupted
All right
Ill be brief
You came here at the request of somebody prob ably your sister to find out if you could whether her husband had any claim on the Harden Brooke farm which was owned by John Landon hundred years ago
The present John Landon or Claude Miller came because he was down and out and he thought you might give him lift
Do you know Sam Vane of Linhampton Ive heard of him Well hes mighty slick policeman and hes helped me in this case
But to come to the point
know where there is will that gives the whole farm with everything on it to John Landon
The old man made the will after the one be queathing the property to his daughters son who was Harden Brookes grand father
Thats how it has come down to Brooke
He has no more right to that farm than have FACING CRISIS
dont see how that can be she broke in with sudden indignation have been told that it had been allowed to run don even worse than in the original John Landons time and that Mr Brooke has worked hard on it for ten years to bring it to its present satis factory condition
That should give him right to the farm independently of any will My dear girl She flashed look at him that caused him to change his form of address and seemed to jolt his watery eyes closer to gether
Miss Severly mean
There can be no right except under the law
will show you or tell you where that will is so that John Landon and of course your sister will get this farm
All ask is thousand dollars cash
The farm is valued at ten thousand
thousand for my services is too little but want to see the rightful heir get his own
Then there is another consideration
am here to have John Landon arrested and taken back to Philadelphia
If make this ar rangement with him through you why shant be able to find him
You un derstand He gave her sly wink that made her fingers itch to bestow ringing slap on his pasty face
All she did however was to take up the school bell from her desk
School is going to take up again he squeaked his smirk widening
Well Ill come back at five oclock for my answer and would advise you to be here then if you want to keep your sisters husband out of jail
As for the will dont mind telling you that it isnt thousand miles from the old farmhouse over there
Goodby for the present
wish could come to school to you
Only Im afraid Id be making love to my teacher Marcus Tolman made quick exit
Perhaps it was well for him that he did
There was heavy ebony ruler on Letha Severlys desk and she dropped the bell to reach for it just as the check suit followed the aggressive yellow shoes out of the door
The girl shrugged her shoulders and laughed as the door closed
Nevertheless two tears of angry annoyance appeared like dewdrops on her cheeks
She brushed them away quickly but she could not brush away the feeling of hu miliation caused by the interview that had been forced upon her
The coarse ness of Mr Tolman had seemed to exhale from his person so that Letha felt actually sticky with it
She glanced up at the clock
It was time to call the children in
But she did not take up the bell again just then
In stead she locked the door and opened one belonging to little room at the back of her desk which had been an extra classroom at one time when the attendance was much larger and which no one entered but herself
Come out John she called in low tone
The person who stepped out was none other than John Landon known to Har den Brooke as Claude Miller
He wore the old coat and trousers in which he had dropped from the hayloft the afternoon before
But he had on one of Hardens clean gray flannel shirts and in his hand was the soft hat which Har den had carried up to his room at five oclock in the morning
Has he gone was his anxious ques tion
Yes you can see him through the window going down the road to the vil lage
wish could have got you other things besides the shirt and hat
But couldnt
wrapped those up in paper and even then felt as if were not acting quite square with Marion You always act square Letha he declared earnestly
Does Tolman know am still about here Im afraid he does What shall do
dont want to be lugged back to Philadelphia
They will find me guilty if ever they put me THE ARGOSY
on trial
am innocent but dont see how Im to prove it
Besides there was that automobile took to get away in
left it at the side of the road when saw chance to jump freight for the West
But theyll say stole it just the same
Im an unlucky devil
If it wasnt for Nettie and the kid Id swipe gun and end it all
Say thing like that again and Ill do it for you myself with this ruler threatened Letha the impatience that goes with redgold hair flaming up sud denly
Weve got to get that jewelry back to Harden Brooke before you can commit suicide
You know that dont you know you say it grumbled Miller ungraciously
And mean it hate to do it
dont know whether can
There are others who have some thing to say about that
How do know that they will let me She gave him look that made him shuffle his feet nervously
This slight little sisterinlaw of his always had had way of making him stand around when they all lived in Philadelphia
Now that he was in worse fix than he ever had been in before with three charges of rob bery threatening she was taking hold of his affairs with firmness which he felt was the only thing that might save him from States prison
Get back into that room till school is over she ordered as he looked at her pleadingly very much like dog ex pecting whipping
Then Ill tell you what you are to do
must have little time to think it all out It never seems to me that you need to study thing much
Your ideas come to you all worked out and by George they are always good With this tribute he moved back into the little room and she closed and locked the door
Then she rang the bell for the afternoon session
Meanwhile Marcus Tolman walking down the road made his own plans which were not intended to benefit either Letha Severly or her weakfibered brotherin law
CHAPTER VI
THE BURGLARPROOF SAFE
FTER leaving the Bates home and the longlegged Raymond calling for his chauffeur Harden drove to Bellsville at speed that barely missed recklessness
Something had to be thought up to meet the horrible situation in which he found himself
How was he to explain to Raymond Bates that he could not produce the jewelry for inspection without admitting that it had been stolen again
Harden had faith in his own ability to run down the thief eventually but in the mean time he must keep the loss of the jewels secret
It would be bad enough to admit it when he had failed
But he would not fail
Once let him get his hands on Claude Miller which should not be difficult and the booty would be recovered as natural sequence
He drove his car into the bam and assuring himself with sigh of relief that the Bates machine was nowhere in sight he walked thoughtfully over to the house
The telephone bell rang as he entered
It was Gertie Kelly calling to tell him that she had warned everybody west and south to look out for Claude Miller and that they had all promised to do so
He hasnt been seen so far she added
You didnt find him in Lin hampton did you No was his brief reply
He wanted to shut off the garrulous Gertie but it was not easily done
She liked to talk to the goodlooking young farmer whom none of the girls had been able to charm and besides she was des perate in her curiosity to learn what was at the bottom of this Claude Miller affair
She suspected that it was much more im portant than Harden had intimated
FACING CRISIS
Have you recovered any of the things he stole she asked
Not yet hope you will hope
Goodby Do you think you will get the things back persisted Gertie before he could hang up
think so He slapped the receiver on the hook but it had not been there five seconds when the bell rang again
Deuce take it grumbled Harden
What does she want now He took his time about removing the receiver and the bell rang once more
Hello he snapped
It was mans voice that responded this time with sonorous That you Brooke
Raymond Bates speaking This is Harden Brooke
Been ex pecting you up here
Where are you At home
Find cant come up till the afternoon
Will be there to look over my mothers stuff about four oclock
Will that suit you Very well Harden contrived to say this in care less even cheerful tone
It was putting off the evil moment for little but none the less he would have to face the music later and it was with something approach ing despair that he rang off and went into the kitchen to speak to his sister
Havent found him Marion
But have lines out and ought to round him up before night
suppose you havent heard anything Nothing she answered as she laid sisterly hand affectionately upon his arm
But youll get him know
You always get what you go after
Why dont you hunt through the woods
Thats where they found the other thief will
But cant spend too much time scouring the country
have that thirty acres of hay to cut this week
It will be too ripe if dont get at it soon Marion nodded
She knew her brother would not allow even his anxiety over the robbery to stand in the way of his haying
Cant you get somebody to cut the hay she asked
intend to do that if can
This is busy season but might get that Morrison boy to help if can hire man to run the mower
Morrison has three boys and he might spare me Dick
Ill call him up this afternoon
But he wont be much use to me unless can find man He went out to the living room
The next moment he had flung himself upon an individual who stood at the open door of the staircase
He was heavyset fellow of thirty five or so in the bluejeans and shape less soft hat of farm laborer behind the times
His square unshaven jaw was set in permanent truculence emphasized by the glittering black eyes under heavy brows
When Harden seized him by his mas sive shoulders and swung him around he glared as if wondering why he had been attacked
Now Garrett what are you after
Speak quick before smash you Harden Brooke had had great deal to disturb him and his nerves were ajangle
He felt that it would do him good to thrash this discharged hired man of his if there were the slightest excuse for it
He needed the exercise
aint doing anything Harden growled Garrett
was looking for you Did you think was upstairs
Didnt you hear me talking in the kitchen
was speaking loud enough
Thats too thin
You were going to sneak up those stairs if hadnt come in
Ive mind to land one on your jaw anyhow The steel thews of the young farmer stiffened and he shook the burly Garrett with his left hand while his right fist drew back as if setting for blow
Hold on protested Garrett
There aint no call for you to get mad
know you done right to fire me
oughtnt to have kicked that horse and wouldnt THE ARGOSY
have done it if hadnt been drinking
But ant to come back
Ive had enough of the city
Theyre all after fellows coin
When they get it they chuck him out on his head
You have haying to do
Youve got to have some body
heard you say so Oh you heard that did you in terrupted Harden
Then you knew was in the kitchen
Well Ill hire you for week
But you must cut out the drink and if catch you hurting one of my horses again Ill send you to the hospital
Get that All right
You can bank on me doing the right thing
Youve got to say can do as good days work as any man you ever had How did you get here from Lin hampton
Didnt walk did you asked Harden suspiciously
didnt pass you on the road
Ive just come from there Caught ride on an automobile
Reckon was in front of you as you came home
Thats why you didnt pass me
came right up to the house and found the door open
was looking for you when you grabbed me Well come on and get out the mower
Youd better cut that fifteen acres in the north field along the State road first While Garrett went about his work with an industry and skilfulness only second to his employers Harden looked carefully through his big wood lot and assured himself that Claude Miller was not there
All the rest of the day he spent in riding about in his car visiting many of his neighbors and making constant in quiries
He had no success and it puz zled him
What had become of the man
About three oclock he came to the schoolhouse on the Town Line road
He could not help pulling up to look through the window
He had blurred vision of groups of restless heads and shoulders but could not find Lethas among them
He was just going on when the door opened and she stood on the threshold
havent found Miller he an nounced havent seen him have you His tone and manner were matterof fact but there was glint in his eyes as he looked at the flushed cheeks of this girl who had stirred him more in few days than all the Gertie Kellys had been able to do in years
You have man working for you havent you she asked evading his query
see somebody in that field above the barns
thought it was you till you stopped here Its Garrett the man discharged for drunkenness
He asked to come back so put him to work cutting hay
But dont think shall keep him
Hes surly fellow and dont care to trust him with my horses Will he sleep in the house No
Ill give him cot have in the loft over the stables
He used to sleep there about half the time when he was with me before
He would rather be there than in regular bed
Hes tramped and beaten his way all over the country worked in Dakota for two years and he says the best bedroom in the world is moving boxcar
Well wont keep you from your school
If you should happen to hear anything of Miller but of course you wont
How could you He acknowledged her smiling Good by with wave of his gloved hand and drove down the road to his ftrnv As he got there he saw big gray car gliding easily to smooth halt in front of the barn and Raymond Bates hailed him from seat by the side of the driver
Here we are Brooke
Hope havent kept you waiting Well the crucial moment had arrived
Now what was he to do
suppose you have the jewelry at the house
Run the car to the side of the road Turner he directed his chauf feur
Now Brooke if youre ready Raymond Bates had been accustomed all his life to having things done for him as he wanted without trouble to himself
FACING CRISIS
He had told Harden that he would be there to identify the jewelry belonging to his mother and he never doubted that it would be produced
He sauntered up the lawn by the side of Harden chatting on indifferent mat ters entirely at his ease
He did not notice that his companions sunbrowned face showed peculiar white spot in the middle of each cheek or that the lips were drawn so tightly over the teeth that they too were purplishwhite
Marion peeped at them from her kitchen and there was anxious sympathy in her eyes as they met the fixed gaze of her brother
Then she went back and shut the door
She could do nothing but somehow she had faith that Harden would find some way out of his dilemma
Indeed he had hit upon plan that would give him more time
That he felt was all he needed
If he could have day or two he would find this wretched tramp who had stolen the treasure
He led his visitor into the office
Ah see
In that safe exclaimed Bates nodding approval
It looks strong enough to hold kings ransom
Open her up Brooke Harden went over to the safe and turned the knob as if he were working the combination
He did this for more than minute
Then he stood up and looked in dismay at Bates
Whats the trouble old top asked Raymond
Forgotten the numbers It ought to open murmured Harden as if reflectively
Ill try it again With deliberate care as it seemed he turned the knob certain number of times each way watching closely to see that the pointer always stopped at the right place
Then he tried the handle as he had done before
But the safe would not open
It must be out of order he said in distressed tone
Unlucky when you want to see the jewelry so particularly
Perhaps didnt do it right
Ill try once more But the next attempt was without re sult
So were two more that he made
Sure you know the combination asked Bates lighting cigarette and im mediately throwing it to the floor and stamping out the fire in his impatience
Maybe you have the wrong figures
Have you got them written down No
But Im quite sure of them
Ive used them dozen times since Ive had the safe
But this isnt the first time it hasnt worked
may have to get man to come from Syracuse to open it
cant do it today however
Wed bet ter call it off for this time and Ill tele phone you when get the door open Never till now had Harden Brooke supposed he could pretend so successfully
It was his disposition to be entirely open and straightforward
Yet here he was twiddling knob that he knew had noth ing to do with fastening the safe and do ing it with an air of sincerity that as tonished him
hate to come up here again ob jected Bates
The mater will go into hysterics if cannot satisfy her this afternoon that her precious gimcracks are all right
You dont know my mother or you wouldnt propose to stand her off even for day when she is set on thing Harden Brooke was rather glad he did not know the lady if she were likely to be more insistent than her son but he did not say so
Instead he made one more pretense of trying to unlock the safe and shrugged his shoulders with most edifying look of disappointment when he failed
Its no use Mr Bates
Well have to give it up for today
am sorry but you see for yourself that it cant be helped
Thats the worst of these burglar proof safes
When they do get out of order it takes an expert mechanic to get the door open Bates was not at all inclined to accept this unsatisfactory decision however
But he protested
It seems to me Perhaps can THE ARGOSY
Before Brooke realized what he in tended to do Raymond stepped past him and seizing the knob and handle of the safe gave them violent pull simul taneously
The door swung open
Wow ejaculated Bates with tri umphant grin
Is the inside door un locked It was unlocked
Flinging it back he hurriedly investigated the interior which obviously contained nothing but the scat tered law books and papers
He turned on Harden Brooke ac cusingly
Where is it he demanded
There is no jewelry in this safe
And by the Lord Harry he shouted this com bination knob is nothing but bluff CHAPTER VII
lethas enigma
ETHA SEVERLY was not sorry that Marcus Tolman came at four oclock instead of five as he had said he would
School had been dismissed and the girl was sitting at her desk lines of perplexity between her perfectlyarched brows and faraway expression in her eyes when he knocked at the door
Then she saw that horse and buggy were outside her window and she recog nized it as the property of the black smith in the village
Come in she called
Tolman smirked at her confidently
Then he struck what he felt was an easy attitude
Leaning on desk with one hand and crossing one yellow shoe ele gantly over the other he fanned himself with his straw hat
My appointment was for five oclock he reminded her
But borrowed the rig you see out there and got here ahead of time
saw the children leave so ventured to knock He waited for response but she did not speak and he continued briskly As lawyer it is my custom to come directly to the point
What is your an swer
Will you pay me thousand dol lars for that will
It will give John Landon the farm and make your sister comfortable financially for the first time since she married him The reply came short and sharp No For moment he appeared to be dum founded
Then he asked with osten tatious meekness beg your pardon Miss Severly
Are you authorized to decline my offer Yes If she could have expressed her con tempt more forcibly than by answering him in monosyllables she would have done so
look of ratlike cunning sprang into his little eyes spreading slowly over his whole visage
You are authorized he said smoothly
Then you must have seen John Landon since this morning She saw that he was trying to trap her but there was no sign of trepidation as she returned coldly There is nothing else believe He moved toward the door
Only that it was part of my offer to quash the Philadelphia charges against John Landon alias Claude Miller
Dont forget that She did not reply and with his oily smirk in full working order belying the malice in his shifty eyes Tolman walked out
Through the window she watched him drive down the road until he reached the bend which would take him to Bellsville
Then locking the outer door she opened the one belonging to the little room and spoke to her brotherinlaw without let ting him come out
You are quite sure of what you told me this morning she began in low dis tinct tones
The man who came from the window of the farmhouse gave some thing to the other one who was waiting Hugging himself together with shiver of vague terror he passed limp hand FACING across his mouth and replied in tone of puerile petulance Of course Im sure
The moon hadnt quite gone down
It was little package done up in paper
heard the paper crackle
The other man opened it and held up something that glittered and sort of tinkled
Hello says
That guy must have pinched Brookes jewelry while he was in there
Gee says Never mind what you said she broke in
What did the men do Claude Miller looked pained and his loose under lip quivered as if he were about to make tearful remonstrance
But she didnt give him time
The quickest way will be for me to repeat your story as you told it this morning and if make any mistakes you can correct me
But do it in very few words
If you are to keep out of prison we must hurry But Letha he whined
Keep quiet and listen she admon ished
When saw Harden Brooke taking you up to your bedroom last night had no chance to speak to you
But Id had the letter from Margaret telling me that Tolman was coming here after you How did he know would be here and who told Margaret She silenced him with flash of her dark eyes and went on rapidly My poor sister cares for you though youre such poor excuse for man that dont know why Ive always been good to her he bleated
When had work and before they framed that job on me at the Imperial Market gave her all made and So early this morning she con tinued did what Id been trying to work up courage for all night
went up to your room and told you to get away and come here to the school Yes that was good thing
gave you back the key didnt The tendency of his mind to run on small things was characteristic
She did CRISIS
not trouble to answer but warned him with gesture to pay attention
When you got to the ground you lay down behind the bushes to make sure no body had seen you
Soon these two men came over the lawn and one of them climbed up to your window
He was in the house about ten minutes Fifteen should say Well fifteen
Then he came down and gave the package to the waiting man Thats how it was assented Miller eagerly
They talked for while fuss ing about who should keep the package
Then the guy who had it not the one who had been in the house swore and said something didnt hear except got the word Syracuse and thought he talked about bank and safe know he said box But it was all jumbled up and he talked down in his throat
There was something about mer chandise or mercantile too that will do
Youll stay here till come back with some food
dont know how long shall be
Mind you dont show yourself at the window She had opened the door and after cautiously surveying the road both ways was about to step out when Claude Miller laid tremulous hand on her arm
Look here Letha
You know didnt do that thing in Philadelphia dont you he pleaded
If didnt feel certain of it wouldnt raise my hand for you not even for my sisters sake was her cleancut answer as she went out and closed the door listening to make sure he turned the key inside
Any one who might have seen this trim pretty girl walking easily down the road in the direction of the Harden Brooke
farm loose ends of her shining hair blow ing about her cheeks would certainly have been attracted by her elflike beauty
On the other hand he would have ridiculed the suggestion that weighty matters were on her mind
As she entered the house loud voices in the office made her pause
THE ARGOSY
Raymond Bates and Harden Brooke were talking over the absence of the jew els from the safe and it was evident that the former was suspicious yet Brookes reputation for absolute honesty and un blemished integrity had spread far beyond the bounds of Bellsville
But how do you account for it Mr Brooke Raymond demanded as Letha reached the halfopen door
You said the jewelry was in this safe andthat the only reason you could not show it to me was that you couldnt get the door open
Yet when opened it very easily con sidering that you couldnt do it with all your trouble there was nothing inside but few books and bundles of law papers
The question is where are my mothers jewels Mechanically Harden fumbled among the papers in the safe while his mind worked busily
He could not see way out but it was some relief not to be obliged to look into Raymond Batess in credulous face
Harden was not used to deception
You cant find them can you barked Raymond
They certainly are not here Well then what is your theory Raymond Bates was the son of wealthy man and most of his time was devoted to the mere joy of living
But he had inherited the business instinct and his tones were hard
There is only one theory replied Harden
That is that the jewelry must have been stolen for the second time That seems to be the only explana tion assented Raymond with keen look
Yet dont understand why you could not open the door when it gave way at my first pull That is very simple
Everybody knows that often defective lock will stick fast for long time and then all at once without any apparent reason yield of its own accord
This safe lock has its whims like any other It Weis at this moment that Harden caught sight of Letha standing at the door
He was quick to seize an opportunity by speaking to her to turn Raymond Batess thoughts in another direction for few moments
Good afternoon Letha Good afternoon she responded
beg your pardon if am intruding
But could not help overhearing you say that you had missed some valuable property and Mr Raymond Bates Miss Severly interrupted Harden introducing them
She smiled graciously upon the tall Mr Bates and he embarrassed by the unex pected advent of beautiful young wo man blushed until his neck face and par ticularly his outstanding ears were in condition of violent inflammation
Miss Severly is my cousin several times removed explained Harden
You are to be pit mean envied of course
er beg your pardon stammered Raymond
While young Mr Bates never quite composed in the presence of pretty girl floundered miserably in his endeavor to present graceful front Letha conveyed to Harden with slight raising of her brows and lightning dart from her dark eyes that he must follow her lead
Was it the beautiful necklace and things you showed me last night that you were looking for in that safe Harden she asked smiling
Yes cut in Raymond becoming more coherent when business took the place of social exchanges
They belonged to my mother
They were taken from our house by burglar who was captured
Later they were placed in the care of Mr Brooke
came here to identify them
But when we opened the safe They were not there interrupted Letha still smiling
could have told you that before you looked You broke out Harden
Why what can you know about Mr Bates she continued calmly ignoring Hardens interjection that safe is not to be trusted
You have seen that for yourself
The jewelry belonging to FACING CRISIS
your mother is in safe deposit box in Syracuse In Syracuse Yes
Mr Brooke has been away all day
His sister and both know that anybody can open that safe if he tries long enough
Was it not natural for his sister and his cousin to take the liberty of conveying such treasure to place of real safety
And what safer place can there be than the vaults of bank Turning to Harden she added with smiling contrition
hope you wont be angry with us
But you can assure Mr Bates that the jewelry is in safe deposit box in Syracuse and that it can be produced when required Well when can see it asked Ray mond
My mother Is it necessary for you to see it at all she asked quickly Only to identify it But she smiled
Mr Brooke has no package of jewelry except what was taken from your house by the burglar so there cant be any question that it is Mrs Batess property
You can set her mind at ease by telling her it is in place of perfect security in Syracuse bank What bank is it My safe deposit box is in the Second Mercantile she replied
There was pause during which Ray mond Bates tried not to look conscious that she was gazing at him with mis chievous amusement
At last he blurted out Very well Miss Severly
will tell my mother
It was er very good of you to take so much interest in the matter
appreciate it am sure Well to be frank Mr Bates did it for my cousin Harden more than for you
Still am glad that you approve what Ive done
only hope Harden wont scold me too much when you have gone This was hint that Raymond Bates felt obliged to take
There was no ex cuse for his remaining any longer
So he stammered out confused Thank you Miss Severly
Good afternoon and managed somehow to get out of the office and the house
As the big car surged away in cloud of smoke and dust Harden Brooke turned to Letha with puzzled smile that was quite without mirth
CHAPTER VIII
LETHA HAS HER HANDS FULL
THAT was an ingenious way of help ing me out Letha said Harden looking curiously at her
But it is only temporary expedient
What shall we do when he finds weve been lying to him Who says weve been lying she countered with an enigmatic smile
Some stories that seem doubtful are marvelously like the truth
Dont you think Mr Bates believed me Perhaps
But it will be easy for him to telephone the Second Mercantile Bank in Syracuse and find out whether you have safe deposit box there or not He cant very well telephone tonight
By the time he gets back to Linhampton there will be nobody at the bank except the night watchman and he wont know Thats true admitted Harden re flectively
But he can get the bank in the morning and it will come to the same thing
For that matter there may be somebody there tonight who can give him the information
It wont be late when he reaches home
know you meant well but when he learns that you have no box at the Second Mercantile he will be so suspicious that am afraid the whole truth will come out
Look at it as may can see only that am in very bad fix Not so bad but that you can get out of it if you follow carefully the clues in your hands There will be no time for that Im afraid
What have to do first of all is to hide from the Bateses the fact that you have no box at the bank
There is only one way to do that and it will be an off chance THE ARGOSY
What is that way For you to be in Syracuse when the bank opens in the morning and rent box
should say Raymond Bates is not an early riser and you may have the box in your name before he telephones
Of course the bank will tell him so and he will be satisfied
He wont know how long youve had it Letha looked at the office door to satisfy herself that it was tightly closed
Then she broke into ripple of laughter that Harden thought was the most musical sound he ever had heard and this too in spite of his being worried almost to despair over his dilemma
Your plan has great deal to recom mend it she conceded as her laugh quieted down to the smile which always bewitched him
But it is unnecessary Unnecessary
What do you mean Only that need not rent box in the Second Mercantile Bank because have box there already
And are the jewels in it did not say so You told Raymond Bates they were No
Not even that she corrected
Although gave him that impression
If you will try to recall exactly what was said it was this After had told him his mothers property was in box in Syracuse bank he asked what bank remember perfectly And you recollect that evaded his question by saying My safe deposit box is in the Second Mercantile Yes and of course he took
it for granted Naturally
He supposed meant the jewelry was in that box
admit wished him to think so
But you see did not actually make such an assertion Harden Brooke drew in and emitted long breath and passed hand across his forehead
This is too deep for me he confessed
What does it all mean
You really have box in the Second Mercantile Bank Yes
rented it two weeks ago
have papers of some value as well as other articles that do not care to carry around with me and it has been my custom for year or two to have safe deposit box
It is not expensive and it saves great deal of anxiety And are Mrs Batess diamonds there No
If they were should have told you at once
But she added quickly as his face fell Ill tell you for your comfort that am pretty sure they are in some safe deposit box in Syracuse Why do you think so cant tell you now
If you will trust me for day or two feel sure can lay my hand on the thief or thieves for there is more than one in the plot
But must be allowed free hand for the present Harden gazed earnestly at the fair young face with its sweetlycurved lips and the eyes glistening with selfconfi dence
Then he decided that he must let her haye her way
will not interfere with you he promised
Thanks She smiled reassuringly and tripped away to talk to Marion in the kitchen
As for Harden although he had pledged himself not to hinder her plans by asking questions or making suggestions he men tally reserved to himself the privilege of following any independent line of action that might lead to the recovery of the stolen treasure
The capture of the thieves while important was secondary consideration
He went out to the barns where Gar rett had already begun the feeding and bedding of stock and other stable tasks that come under the general head of chores There was no conversation between the two men
But Harden helped in thd work in matteroffact way giving an occa sional brief direction which Garrett ac knowledged with grunt
So it was not long before everything was done including the milking and pasturing of the cows and Harden strode over the lawn for supper
FACING CRISIS
Am to come too growled Garrett
suppose get supper dont His employer did not relish having this surly illconditioned fellow at the table with Marion and Letha
But there was no way out of it and five minutes later Garrett was washing his face and hands outside the kitchen door waiting for the call to the meal
Supper was nearly over with nobody speaking except in monosyllables when Garrett turned to Harden
Aint heard anything about that fel low who got away with your stuff last night have you the man who was working for you No was Hardens short reply
He must have climbed down the ivy out of his window eh dont know Garrett scowled at the noncommunica tive Harden but did not press his ques tions
Soon he had finished his meal and getting up from the table abruptly with out word shambled out of the house to lounge about until it should be time for him to seek his cot in the hayloft
didnt suppose he knew anything about the robbery said Harden as he watched his hired man going down the lawn
Who told him saw him talking to the driver of that motorcar that brought Mr Bates answered Marion
Afterward when Mr Bates started home Garrett was leaning over the car asking something sup pose for saw Mr Bates speaking to him and Garrett nodded Raymond Bates is one of those loose mouthed idiots who doesnt know enough to keep his business to himself com mented Harden
Ive no doubt he told Garrett all about it Letha said nothing
She left the room while Marion and her brother were still talking and hastily collected what food she could in the
kitchen for the hungry Claude Miller whom she had left waiting for her in the schoolhouse
It was dark when she got there but she did not light any of the lamps
She knew her way about well enough to find her way to the door of the room in which she had instructed her brotherinlaw to stay
It was only when she found that the door was wide open and that he did not answer when she called him both as Claude Miller and John that she struck match and looked about her
There was no one in the building but herself
Involuntarily she let the match bum down almost to her fingers before she blew it out
She lighted another quickly for as the flame died down on the first one she had noticed small folded paper on her desk
There were other papers there which had prevented her observing it before
She read the few penciled words on it before her second match was exhausted
They were Had to leave
Will see you later
For minute or more she stood in the darkness reflecting
She was certain to begin with that her brotherinlaw had not left of his own volition
Somebody had come and made him go
It must have been Marcus Tolman
She decided also after very short con sideration that Tolman had not arrested him
In the first place he was not police officer so could not do so legally and again if her weakkneed relative were prisoner of the law he would have said so
She took her regular seat behind her desk to think it out further
At the end of five minutes she had come to con clusion
Getting up briskly she left the school house and as she closed the door which fastened with spring lock she stood and listened
Not sound indicated the proximity of any one about but herself
So still carrying the parcel of food she had brought with her she went back to the farmhouse
THE ARGOSY
Harden has gone out with his car announced Marion
He said he might not be home till late CHAPTER IX
CROSS PURPOSES
RE the doors and windows of the house all secured asked Letha when the two young women had settled down in the spacious livingroom Marion sewing and Letha with book
do not trust that man Garrett Neither do returned Marion
That is why have locked and bolted jthe outside doors and the stair door
cant do anything upstairs except shut down the window of the room belonging to the hired man because everything is open up there
But we can prevent any body getting down to us And there is nothing up there that could be stolen Nothing that know of Letha smiled and shook her head
You did not know the Bates jewelry was up there
Yet it was and it seems other people knew it as well as Harden
should like to look about that upper story if you will come with me
We might come across something else that would attract burglars now that Harden is away wouldnt go up there tonight for million dollars declared Marion
But do not expect burglars to come again
Who is to know that Harden isnt at home
He often goes down to the village with his car in the evening and unless some one is watching nobody could say when he comes back Thats true assented Letha
But should like to go up to that floor
Those old beams and the way they are laid have interested me very much Not for me was Marions resolute negative
If you want to go do it
But wouldnt if were you Letha dropped the subject and seemed to bury herself in her book
Occasionally she and Marion would exchange few words but most of the time Lethas thoughts were racing along as she tried to decide what her next move should be leading not only to the recovery of the jewels but the capture of the thieves as well
It would have been comparatively easy if her brotherinlaw had not disappeared
With his help she believed she held the key to the mystery
Now she would have to begin all over again
At nine oclock Marion who had been nodding for half an hour or more declared that she must go to bed
She was too sleepy to see her needle and she had to be up at five
Arent you sleepy Letha
You ought to be for you had little rest last night to say nothing of the awful time you put in with that strange man
Doesnt your head pain you Nothing to speak of was Lethas careless response
am not at all sleepy just now
But dare say soon shall be
You go to bed and Ill stay up and read while longer
Perhaps Harden will be home
Then we shall both feel safer in our rooms
Is he certain to be very late dont know
Hes going on business about the robbery
think hes heard something about that Claude Miller
Of course he is the thief
But Harden may be home soon
He only said he might be late
Well Ill go to bed she added with yawn as she got up from her chair
Good night dear It was very lonely when Marion had gone into her room and closed the door and Letha wondered why the wind always blew so much harder around the house than elsewhere
For half an hour she sat book in hand listening
Then she got up and softly opened the door of Marions room which like her own adjoined the livingroom
Marion was fast asleep
It was now that Letha did peculiar thing
She went into the office where the big safe was the principal article of furni ture but which contained besides an FACING CRISIS
open rolltop desk and took from pigeonhole in the desk an electric flash light
Then she opened the door of the stairway and went softly to the floor above
She shuddered as she passed the open trap above the stairway and had difficulty in repressing scream when some unseen creature flapped loudly almost in her very face
But she held herselfin and indulged in little smile at
her own fear
She re membered that bats held high carnival at night in this ghostly place
Harden Brooke had told her so more than once
The bat flew out of one of the big window openings and Letha went about her investigations with businesslike com posure
That she was possessed of strong nerves notwithstanding her delicate frame and sweet face has been demon strated already
She felt that she needed all her nerve now
On the other hand she did not hesitate in the task she had set herself which was to find the will for which Marcus Tolman had demanded thousand dollars
He had been indiscreet enough to ad mit that it was not thousand miles from the farmhouse and Letha had soon come to the conclusion that if old John Landon had secreted it anywhere most probably it was here among these ancient beams and rafters
She had been up here before and had noticed the star and arrow cut into the beams even before Marion who had ac companied her pointed them out
She had seen the initials too
When Tolman talked about the will it was natural for Letha to associate these sym bols and letters with the unknown hiding place
That Tolman had taken her brotherin law away from the schoolhouse she felt sure
Also she believed his disappearance had something to do with this will that Tolman meant to turn to his own profit
Her purpose was to obtain possession of it before the rascal could get it
Then she could bargain with him on behalf of the unfortunate John Landon who was so pitifully unable to take care of himself
The swinging beam under which had been hidden the Bates jewelry and where Harden Brooke had found the old coins was still displaced and it did not take girl of Letha Severlys quickness of ap prehension long to understand the prin ciple on which it had been made to move when properly manipulated
She argued that other beams might be swung aside if one knew the secret of them
So she tried two of them but with out result
Then she turned the light of her flash on the arrow and star alternately until with low ejaculation of satisfac tion she believed she had hit on the solution
Examining the star closely she noted that it had five rays
Also that one ray was noticeably longer than any of the others
Taking this as guide she found that it pointed to place midway between two of the beams
For moment she was at loss
Then throwing her light upon the arrow she observed that it aimed in the same parallel direction as the long ray of the star but three feet to the left
Between the two imaginary lines was beam
pause for inspection and calculation and Letha was working to remove wooden tongue like that which had been found by Harden in another beam and which he had accidentally broken off
It did not take her long to decide that she must have some sharp tool to get the tongue out
She looked about her but there was nothing there
little shrug of vexation and down she went cautiously to the kitchen where she knew box of carpenters tools was kept
In few minutes she was up again with chisel and hatchet
Naturally handy it did not take her long with the aid of these implements to extract the tongue
Then with slight exertion she swung the beam aside and upward revealing the same sort of cavity as that in which Harden had so vainly secreted the Bates jewelry THE ARGOSY
She had just time to take out two folded papers yellowed by age and to replace the beam with the tongue thrust back into place when slight scraping outside one of the yawning window open ings made her switch off the light and hide behind pile of old lumber in far corner
Listening intently she knew that the scraping was caused by the placing of ladder against the outside wall
She could hear labored breathing and then three men crawled in and stood still
It was very dark but the stars enabled her to make out the outlines of the three intruders
She saw that one was thin and rather tall another shorter and stocky of build and the third burly individual who seemed to be in command
To Be Concluded
course when man is being paid hundred and forty month by young millionaire as wireless op erator on said millionaires yacht and he is only secondrate amateur at wire less anyhow its hardly appropriate to step up to the gift horse pull its teeth apart and start criticising the beast
But maintained certain degree of independence by quarreling with my boss about twice as often as really wanted to
had got through college on the money he had paid me to get him through
But my Lord man had once de manded of him what in the world are you getting out of your education An awful lot of fun you old grind Louis Hartman had retorted
And the use of your brains is the least expensive part of most of it But what will you know Why should know anything
Al ways sure of being able to hire somebody else to do the knowing It was wofully true
The millions old Gottfried Hartmann made out of sausage will keep Louis busy spending them for long while especially if he always hires somebody else to run the business
Of course he didnt live down to his idiotic philosophy
If he had Id never have accepted his invitation for that win ters cruise around the West Indies
As said before could afford to argue with him quite heatedly but it wasnt my place to tell hint where to take his yacht
But when he dropped light anchor half mile off what looked like big ash heap or coal dump with fringe of unhealthy palms around it having sailed four days from as sunkissed and amusementpro viding little harbor as ever lured other yachtsmen like himself was ready to get down to personalities
It was probably the last yachting trip Id ever have
Then having ordered the IT WAS WAR tender lowered he came up and slammed me on the back remarking Some things worth being rich for after all eh For Heavens sake what demand ed crossly
That dump But your glass havent you used it he cried fixing his own on certain spot and keeping it very steady
had used mine for tensecond sweep over the whole of that unsightly pile and had decided that further in spection wasnt worth the strain on my eyes
To humor him raised it again
It was one of Louies many and powerful enough to make Mars look like good sized marble
And happened to hit the spot at which Louies glass was trained
Instant ly perceived that that ugly little island had beauty all its own
She was almost halfconcealed by one of the decrepit palms branches
But could see twothirds of her face also an arm with the sleeve well above the elbow likewise glimpse of the belt that con nected her shirtwaist with one of those narrow skirts they wore before they began to take half yard off the bottom to make them fuller and finally pair of natty white boots that actually looked small
gave the screw of the glass half turn until she looked as if she were standing about ten feet away from me and was all for that island if had to swim to it
Then she raised huge pair of binocu lars and pointed them straight at us
For an instant dropped my glass and so did Louie
Its rude to stare at pretty girl and have her see that youre staring
Huh grunted Louie
She isnt acting bit encouraging She wasnt
If ever gesticulations bade one to depart full speed ahead or astern immediately if not sooner and to keep on departing she was giving us the high sign to get scarce
But Louie muttered never was any good at reading signals
think wed better go over and make sure of what she means
Hey Pete is that ladder down All ready sir Pete responded
Come on Harry Louie invited me
And went
Id lot rather have gone by myself
Id have given years salary as wire less operator on Louies yacht to have fif teen minutes alone with that young lady ashore in which to inform her that Louie looked intelligent only because Id taught him about half of what know that he wasnt really tiptop overgrown boy but halfwitted boob and that any money he displayed he had obtained by stealing from me enough to outfit small gunboat and rob Belgian relief ship
But the motor tender was lot the fast est thing that could get us across the shal lows to that shore
So got aboard it and reflected glumly that the idiot hadnt sense enough to leave me ashore that he just took it for granted that real girl like that would never see my brains over his little pile of gold
For most of the last half mile of that run raised faint hope that the tender would hit something that would rip half her bottom out
could swim good bit faster if not quite so far as Louie
kept up the hope until we were less than hundred yards from shore and could have talked to the girl if she hadnt been holding her finger to her lips in fashion that would have enforced silence on class of boys at baseball game
Then reversed my hopes so suddenly that it jarred my whole system
We had hit something
Tom Healy at the engine reversed it as suddenly as had reversed my hoping apparatus
Nor he nor Billy Nock at the wheel nor Louie nor had ever seen mine of any kind before
But we knew we were seeing one now
As look back on it it wasnt very big mine
But if the whole world ever looks as big to me as that mine did just then Im afraid Ill get worldly
For some reason it didnt go off that time
But Healy was so scared he forgot to shift the clutch ahead again until we were backing up and then the clutch THE ARGOSY
bound and the engine stalled
And Billy Nock was so rattled he forgot to steer backward so that we just set sternfore most for that round head of steel
Back back at that steel can of sud den and unpremeditated death
The girl gave shriek of terror that made my star tled stomachpit sink mile or so
It completely drove from my head the plan had suddenly formed and was rising to execute dive over the opposite side
It made Healeys hand slip from the crank and dropped him full length in the for ward cockpit
never shall know what it did to Billy Nock
For was watching with fasci nated horror the movements of Louie who was leaping over the stem deck and sticking his foot out to push the mine and us apart before we made another more violent bump than the bare shave we had accomplished the first time
It might be the height of presence of mind it might be just little the worst thing in the world to do
Louie didnt know didnt know nobody knew
We just waited and waited and Boom
As toppled off the cockpit seat saw Louie drop overboard
That is all can account for
And then just before passed away there came another boom trifle muffled so that it didnt sound much too large for the general blowup of creation
dont really believe fainted or lost consciousness
My first impression tend ed to confirm the old adage that marriages are made in heaven
For there right be fore my eyes stood the wonderful girl though we had never even been intro duced to each other on earth
But my next sense was one of doubt about the heaven part of it
My head had hit and was still resting on corner of the hot exhaust muffler and there was nothing suggestive of heaven about that or in the remark heard Louis sputtering in the water outside the boat
could not imagine any one in heaven exclaiming Huh
Well Ill be damned Since he was going right on pretty vo ciferously making himself the noisiest center for the moment got up and be gan to rub the scorched back of my head preparatory to stepping over to the side where he clung
Then didnt step
stood still and stared
It wasnt our little mine that had blown up at all
The lesser bang had evidently issued from gun on the deck of very businesslike little patrol launch which was now proceeding deviously but with evident intent of reaching Louies yacht
blurry puff of blue smoke hung lazily about hundred yards behind the launchs present position
But about quarter of mile seaward from our small ship was bank of yellow smoke that made perfect cloud of itself
It was mine blown up out there to hint to the captain of the yacht that it might be safer to lie still and have talk than to attempt any swift getaway
Apparently the little tender had escaped observation thus far and the owner of the yacht was supposed to be aboard
figure that the heavy fog which had broken but fifteen minutes before our arrival at the island had enabled us to get in unobserved especially since we had ar rived on that side of the island where there was no sign of life
The only explanation have ever thought up for our getting through the nice network of mines as we did is be cause Louies yacht was one of those ex treme shallowdraft affairs which really had no business venturing quite so far at sea at all and couldnt have hit mine that couldnt have been in plain view of lookout on real steamer
However it had happened there we were and there was the yacht between the terrifically evident mines and the per fectly obvious and leisurely selfassured patrol boat
Also there was the girl
She recurred to my mind when Louie now only kneedeep in the water stopped his profane sputterings and turned to her
As he spoke too looked at her
She IT WAS WAR was half hysterical over all that had hap pened
It takes quite girl to look beautiful and half hysterical at the same time
But that girl was doing it perfectly
per mitted myself under protection of Louies query to gain complete survey of her attractions
Surely those dainty hands and feet were French or Spanish or something ro mantic though the blondness of her hair and skin proclaimed that she must have come from the northern part of any of the Latin countries she had darkbrown eyes
was thinking very fast
If she were only French or even Spanish it would be all off for Louie
Heaven grant that she be not German
For Louie could get away with whatever dialect his sausage making father had brought over with him
But Louie was trying her in plain English
Pardon me but could you possibly tell me what it all means fairly ached for je ne le comprends pas or No entiendo to But that fairy vision spoke Queen Georges English she spoke it fluently not to say gaseous ly and in perfect uptotheminute Fifth Avenue style above Hundred and Tenth Street
cannot bear even yet to comment You bet your granmas crayon por trait can tell you what its all about
Its about years residence on this coal dump for yous though there aint no particular good reason for hopin it wont be six years
If you two tender babes had had the sense between you to take the cue was tryin to hand you you might made getaway with that pretty little toy ship of yourn
But now you might just as well let me pinch the bunch of yez in stead of waitin for the guard to wake up and poke you around the beach with bayonet
You cn come quiet and peace able please and the baron will listen to any other particular questions thats on yer minds We started peaceable and quiet
She turned to Tom Healy and Billy Nock
Yous cn come along too she in vited
And they came too
It wasnt much over half mile to the end of the coalheap along wellbeaten path at its base
Then we turned along the inner side of what now showed itself to be almost ring with snug little har bor in the middle
Louie had told me he was going into the harbor if the island proved worth looking over
We were going into it all right
And here were buildings long low shacks of the most temporary construc tion also some of the heavy concrete walls that are known as the protectors of ord nance by any one who has ever been to Fort Wadsworth
Warped to dock in the middle of this little harbor lay long black ship which just about filled the ca pacity of the place
It certainly would have been squeezing to put two such ships in there at once
Louie gave me one gasping look
handed it back to him
We both knew
We had stumbled upon the hidden coal ing station of that mysterious raider that had been making the newspapers interest ing when we had last seen any we could read at Porto Rico
And that grim mon ster into which just then men were car rying almost at run huge bags of the soft black coal piled to the height of small hill all over the island that was the raider herself
Before we had gone another fifteen feet younglooking officer ran down the hill to meet us
The girl brought us to halt
Here Rudy are four of the men off that yacht out there she introduced us
They got off in little gasboat before Captain Heiny seen em reckon
Any how they landed down at the other end Gott Rudy exclaimed
And you bring dem guys up here all by yourself already
Say Mamie you could take it from me youll get one iron cross from der kaiser yet Mamie laughed disdainfully
Not reckon fr bringin up them THE ARGOSY
They come like they was little lambs what was leadin to pasture
Youd ought to seen em
They got mixed up pretty close with one them little bombs along the shore just about the time the Friedrich fired shot and you let go the mine the other side of the yacht
This soaked guy went clean overboard
The other toppled into the cockpit an lay still with the muffler singein his hair and neck
And these two makebelieve sailors just laid down to die anywhere the layin was good and handy Rudy had turned now and started back with us toward the row of shacks nestling in the hollow of the great crescent of soft coal
He bade the girl follow
Mean while was making an inventory of Rudy
All told he looked good to me and he sounded better
His broken English was not the sort German learns in school but the kind one picks up in stay of few years right around New York City
Apparently that same idea of the young officer had occurred to Hart mann
Say Herr Offizier he spoke in that utterly nonchalant manner which is the similitude of his entire attitude toward everything would you mind giving us some sort of steer as to what theyre go ing to do to us for accidentally stumbling on this delightful little island of yours dont know Herr Offizier Rudy replied quite seriously
It would make whole lot of difference for why you want to come to our delightful little island
Youll get plenty of chance to exblain that to dem Herrn Capitan
Whether he be lieves you might be something else again see But but Louie began
Anyhow aint supposed to talk with you fellows
But say his voice dropped you dont neither of you hap pen to come from Newark do you Why my fathers sausage factory is out on the meadows hastily responded Hartmann
You dont happen to know anybody by name of Shiffen on Sixth Street num ber hundert and one
got one sister named Hilda what boards there when come away
Her and Mamie here aint never got along good you know how girls is
So Mamie dont know nothin about whether Hildas still there or alive or dead yet Louie apologized for his utter ignorance of Newark beyond his fathers factories save as to the main streets by which mo torists get through and out of that town
His regret sounded pretty genuine
It must be devilish hard he mourned to be cut off from your rela tives like this could have understood his regret if Louie werent half as sympathetic big kid as he is
was regretting lot my self and was guessing whether it would be safe to assure out keeper that knew his sister Hilda perfectly
The trouble would be that if he asked any questions about Newark Id be caught bluffing
dont remember ever seeing even picture postcard of New ark
Anyhow didnt have time to take the chance
In another moment we had been ushered into the august presence of Herr Lieutenant Baron von Hilberstein pink cheeked blueeyed goldenhaired youth of trifle over twenty who stood up to greet us looking as if he was afraid to death of us
It was not of us however that he was afraid
It was of his own almost fault lessly though much too carefully pro nounced English
trust gentlemen he said when he had managed some form of general intro duction you will understand our in quisitiveness from the fact that the usefulness of our station here depends en tirely upon our enemies ignorance of its existence
You will also appreciate that it is difficult for us to understand why you should have brought your yacht here from so pleasant resort as San Juan oh yes we have been the ones inquiring your po sition every few hours under different IT WAS WAR wireless names
We even tried to head you off Jwo days ago by storm warning you did not choose to heed
We tried again this morning but could not get you
Now we see that you have passed forty or fifty more attractive islands with out giving them look
You choose this of all others
You will not mind explain ing why hope If worse came to worst could have ex plained the only reason had ever come
My desire to be anywhere on that island had begun when had caught sight of that pretty girl who had turned out very disappointing thus far
It might be an unpleasant thing to explain in the pres ence of the young lady herself but it wasnt pleasant having that pink boy looking at us as if he thought we were dangerous while he had it in his power to order us blindfolded and shot
had come because Louie had brought me thus far
But Louie Well Louie faltered something rais ing within him creepy sensation that what he had to say didnt sound much like sense you see this island is down on the chart as uninhabited
Nobody seemed to know much of anything about it except that it was on the chart
got the notion it might be interesting to explore er explore the place up little dont you know
He broke off growing red in the face
Exploring an island as small as that and already perfectly indicated on the charts it did sound weak
see our inquisitor broke in
Some such curiosity take it as animated His Excellency ExPresident Roosevelt to discover the River of Doubt this with the merest trace of smile under the fuzzy mustache
Louie and both laughed nervously
Oh just took the notion whim guess you might call it Hartmanns boyish nonchalance was all but going to pieces
see see The young officer spoke as if in hurry to let it go at that
He was wonderfully businesslike con sidering his apparent age
And no doubt it was similar whim which led you to come in close behind our mine field under cover of fog at the top of the tide
Also seeing you had no idea about the place except that it was unin habited beyond what the charts show it was certainly not reason but whim pure and simple which caused you to anchor your vessel outside when the charts indi cated safe harbor as the only possible advantage of the spot Louie threw up his hands
He grinned amiably at the girl
Murder will out he cried flushing
hope this young lady will forgive me
You he turned again toward her will have to admit that hes driving me to it
The captain got little mixed dead reckoning in the fog and we thought we were going down to the front door of your harbor all right he went on
In fact we thought we were over mile beyond it
and making wide circuit to get the end of the channel as the chart shows
If the fog had waited another ten minutes to lift imagine wed have come very near trying to climb your coal mound for we thought we had half mile more to the turn
The first look got at the shore gave me the notion that didnt want to land at all and was on the point of giving the order to back out and start for some thing more interesting when happened to see the lady here
The island was not uninhabited
credit all of you with taste enough to understand that such sample citizen of any land would tempt one to take the shortest cut to some ac quaintance with it It might have broken the tension en tirely but its effect did not reach
The boyish lieutenant blushed shade deeper while he smiled as if he would re buke himself for levity in so serious mo ment
Only Rudy seemed to laugh whole heartedly as if we had somehow tickled his personal vanity
Of course Louie and THE ARGOSY
emitted sort of choked spasm of chuckle which was more or less hyster ical
But the girl thus flattered or honored as she might choose looked highly indig nant and spoke The nerve of him
Say Id just like to ask you and she turned on Louie if them glasses of youm was so good you could see all these bewitchin charms hanging onto me if didnt hand you as many signs to beat it as person could hand out who didnt know the deafand dumb for scat Gawd knows didnt aim to act invitin You certainly didnt Louie admit ted
But your actions failed to out weigh your good looks Freshie she uttered in deep scorn and stuck out her tongue at Hartmann in dead earnest
Whereupon the pinkfaced lieutenant cleared his throat for action again
This is hardly time for jesting he asserted with that deep solemnity one has to use if he isnt going to give up being solemn altogether and laugh
While shall not take any hasty action there be ing plenty of time so far as can see for full consideration of details and consul tation with the superior officers of such vessels as are supplied here it must be quite patent to both of you that much more rational hypothesis to account for your presence than the highly whimsical one you have given would be to the effect that you represent your government in having entertained some suspicion of this island and in attempting to satisfy that suspicion under guise of an innocent yachting cruise Representing my government gasped Louie
Why my dear er lieutenant that is preposterous
That yacht of mine is absolutely private prop erty
Im no more member of the United States army or navy than you are
Ah coldly rejoined the lieutenant his mild blue eyes growing sharp and hard perhaps there has been mistake
Perhaps it is another Louisa II and an other Mr Louis Hartmann who owns the yacht listed as member of the United States Power Squadron of New York which was Number NinetySix in the practise maneuverings held in New York Bay last September There are times when one can get through more thinking in thirty seconds than he could accomplish in thirty ordi nary hours of close application
My first thought caused me to give one startled glance at Louie
was afraid hed blow up and say things unbecoming quasinaval officer made prisoner by German Herr Baron
If theres one thing calculated to get Louie started its the United States Power Squadron
He was enthusiastically in that effort to give amateur owners of pleasure vessels the proud feeling that they were practically commanders in the He was in it at the start
He had stayed in it up to this extremely parlous moment
Most of the members of the are ready any minute to swear that they were asked to form their association by the authorities of the navy
There isnt any question that they formed it
They trained themselves like anything
Those of them who were rich enough got new boats that looked as warlike as deck cleared battleship
And then the navy didnt take them on
It was great disappointment
It was worse
It was an outrage
It was an un speakable act of ingratitude to the high minded patriots who had spent themselves and their hardinherited gold
The thought that after all Uncle Sams unappreciative ungrateful failure to recognize his pet society he should be here actually accused of acting as spy in danger of being summarily shot for be ing spy this thought was enough to get Louie started
It did then and there
Louie forgot the lady
He forgot his own danger
He forgot everything but the raw deal suffered by the United States Power Squadron at the hands of the IT WAS WAR United States navy
He surely taught that pinkcheeked lieutenant lot of Eng lish not to be got out of any books pub lished while Anthony Comstock was alive or even since
Oh it was lucky for Louie that in peace times you cant commit treason against the United States government with your mouth
Even at that dont know as he could have got away with some of the stuff he put across except in very close circle of friends
And although the kaiser and Woodrow Wilson were just then weeping on each others necks in warlike and peaceful peace notes it wasnt right to give the impres sion that our navy could be chased out of the sea by properly manned and man aged fleet of model sailboats
Louie did that as Id heard him do it before and he went on to pay his re spects to all the other departments of the government in fashion to have made the king of Siam wonder if it werent his duty to humanity to take us in order to provide us with government if not quite kul tured at least endowed with faintly hu man intelligence
If that pinkfaced baron wirelessed half of Louies remarks to Wilhelm II its no wonder the imperial government decided that no ruthless submarining could be so insane as getting mixed up in peace efforts with the halfwitted brainsoftened sen iledecayed defective Louie painted for Uncle Sam
Its no wonder the baron softened to ward us
He probably thought it would be shame to waste bullets on the deadli est possible spies from hostile chicken run
Is that true Herr Corporal he asked of Rudy
About this here Power Squadron Rudy responded aint never heard nothing in America
wasnt there long enough yet to be buyin me hundred thousanddollar yachts to play navy games with But by the time he had said this the American girl had got from the corner of the little room to which she had receded
She had planted herself squarely in front of Louie
Her cheeks were blazing and her brown eyes had turned the color of good anthracite
Do you know anything about it Vet terchen Von Hilberstein asked her
About what she asked with the craokle of fire in pine board
About this Power Squadron Power Squadron she repeated hot ly
No cousin mine never heard darn thing about it till right now
But can guess lot moren Ive heard
If this here boobs specimen of this Power Squadron outfit can guess hes got the wrong steer about why it aint recognized by the United States navy
can guess lot better reason than hes give
Its because the United States navy aint so hard up for hospital ships as to be takin floatin bughouses already loaded with loonatics even at gift
Its because the As little navy aint and never was no asylum for feebs even though they might have the dough to buy their own floatin nurseries and hire their own nurses
An while Im talkin Herr Cousin Lieutenant Baron Heiny von Hilberstein Im goin to tell you these here aint no spies
The United States aint got no such system of spies as you Dutchmen to be sendin suspicious reports about what the cop of Squeedunk Crossin ate for his dinner mebbe but the United States when she needs spy cn afford the few cents extra to get one what could tell arsenal from his own big mouth Then she flashed her eyes back at Louie Hartmann
They were already brimming with angry tears
You you an American she cried scornfully
Oh you big boob
you big boob
You you big big She broke off sobbing hysterically to the exclusion of articulation and dashed from the shack
And knew lot more about that little girl than Id dreamed of either when Id heard her sadly unclassic English or when Id first looked upon her THE ARGOSY
absurdly pretty face and thought her the most beautiful woman Id ever seen
Of course she was German German enough to be the cousin of this pink cheeked baron the sister of Corporal Rudy as guessed that evening when heard the baron call Rudy Vetter too and Louie told me that meant cousin German enough to be here with her kin however in the world she had got here lending all the energy and courage she had to them in forlorn island likely at any moment to be turned into hell of deadly danger
But she was American too
could guess that this was not the first time she had given Uncle Sam the support of her highly colloquial eloquence
No doubt the whole station teased her
lot of goodnatured and bitterly lonely soldiers or sailors would be sure to tease as pretty girl as she was
But imag ined they had not teased her about Amer ica after the first week of her stay among them whenever that had been
forgave her her bad English
Al though had never counted my own pa triotism anything to brag about it struck me that heart as loyal as hers could be plenty of excuse for overlooking the fact that the tongue tied to it talked the slang and grammar of shops and cheap tene ments
The man that won that loyal lit tle heart would be well paid for the labor it might cost him to train the tongue to higher speech would be rich in posses sing it even if his labor utterly failed
Was willing to be the man for the labor or the failure even
Well forgot all about our parlous position in figuring that she liked Americans better than Ger mans and that of the two real male Americans present the other one had shattered his chances with the girl beyond all hope of repair
While was doing this reflecting the others were talking mostly in German
It appeared that our position was rapidly getting over the worst of its parlousness
At all events the Herr Lieutenant was leading us out to shady spot under what was left of pair of palms for afternoon coffee and cigarettes
As we stepped from the shack the Louisa II was being towed very carefully into the tiny harbor
The baron stopped for an appraising and approving glance
say Herr Baron Louie spoke up in manner that indicated the effective ness of his normal buoyancy is there any good reason why we shouldnt remain prisoners aboard my yacht was on the point of making that suggestion myself Mr Hartmann the lieutenant responded warmly
We real ly havent any spare room for prisoners on shore here And may ask if theres anything in the code to forbid me the pleasure of in viting our captor and his company aboard this evening for little dinner in honor in honor of Louie broke off falter ingly
Des Kaisers prompted the captor
Oh say Hartmann appealed to him you wouldnt ask that of me yet would you
You know told you Im all against you in sentiments about this war What then Louies honesty had almost put the skids under his painfully builtup safety and nearfriendship with the man who held us prisoners of war
The barons tone had turned stiff and sharp again
Well Id like to make it dinner in honor of your pretty cousin and by way of public apology from one American for insulting the navy of the best little American ever
Wouldnt that go Baron von Hilbersteins face relaxed
He glanced toward the shining smile on the face of his subordinate cousin Rudy
guess we could stand for that he decided
Eh Rudy
The way the foods been lately could almost dine in honor of any of the Allies except Eng land It was after the coffee as we were be ing escorted by Rudy back to our own yacht now very securely tied to the side of the long pier at the end of which the IT WAS WAR raider still yawned for more and more bags of black dirty coal that Louie told me the outcome of the confab in the shack
He wont let us go mourned Hart mann
He wouldnt take my oath or my word as gentleman or my check for half million as security for our keeping our mouths shut about this black hole
He said the secret was too important to trust with any one
Were here here Harry until the islands discovered by the British or the end of the infernal war Well couldnt help it if my tone lacked the mournfulness of his
It might take time to win the affections of the love ly stormy little adopted American Well the man next me at the table was just telling me all this stuff about Ger manys being at the end of her rope is bosh
He says the Central Powers can keep up the fight for ten years Louie looked as if he wanted to bite me
thought you called yourself paci fist he snapped
always knew that was just another alias for damned pro German
You sound as if the idea of ten years more war tickled you Well if it should take me that long maybe it did
If ex Warden Osborne ever wants to get some rudimentary points on the real way to make prison the sort of place for which an old offender will long with pangs of homesickness Im the man to give any points the criminals friend may have overlooked
think that next week had almost got Louie resigned to our gloomy prospect
Certainly our captors spared no pains to make us feel at home
They dined with us that night and they lunched with us next day and they accepted another invi tation to another dinner in the evening
They sang lively songs to console us for our loneliness and grew happy over our being consoled until they sang the mournful songs that showed they were really overjoyed themselves
By the third night it looked as if the festivities were at an end
They had eaten us out of provisions
But on the fourth day they gave us generously of their own meager stock in pay and seemed to love us as well as they had while we were playing the hosts
And that night the raider which had sailed away before dawn of the day after our arrival came in with all hands sing ing
It seemed that the three previous trips had been lean ones in the matter of securing food supplies
The ships they had caught had been inward bound near the end of their trips and of their provi sions
This time fortune was kindlier
Two passenger ships had been bagged within an hour of leaving South American ports their buffets perfectly intact
Also there had been no difficulty in quickly landing the passengers before they had time to raise appetites after the scare of being captured
The raider was fairly fat with food and the stock of two firstclass and one secondclass bars
The genial captain had not had time to acquaint himself with our existence the day we came but he now sent us over an invitation to dine with the officers of his vessel and the lieutenant in charge of the island station
Of course this affair start ed off lot stiffer than our previous din ners had inasmuch as the invited includ ed none of the lowranked men of either ship or shore
But it soon warmed up
The captain made us the guests of honor seating us at either side of his own plate
The first toast proposed was long and painstakingly pronounced eulogy of the President of the United States
an swered it with paean of praise for the kaiser which was so warm they voted to drink it in schnapps instead of cham pagne
To the toast America Louie managed to reply with one to the Ger man people and was sane enough to re frain from any hints that he thought he THE ARGOSY
could tell them better way to govern themselves than they had
Followed toasts and more toasts
Then they grew less formal and got to telling us delicious yarns of their raids yarns that would have made fortune for story writer
They may have been all true or part true or mostly pure fiction but they were all good
Then they grew still less formal
Some body got the piano going and they all sang
Somebody else started phono graph and well it was good night then
The partizans of the machine made music didnt even bother to line up opposite those who held to the piano
Each chose his song and did his best with it until it happened to go softer than the other when he would shift to the one he could hear better
And Louie and made our getaway as gracefully as our legs would let us
Meanwhile they decided that the Louisa IIs cold storage plant was the place to keep the best of the food to be left for the shore guard
The next morn ing it was crammed beyond possibility of shutting its doors
We were bidden to help ourselves
After the raiders depar ture our deck became the messroom for the officers of the station
Another three days brought the lucky raider home again with another load of provisions
There was another night of high yet decent revel
Without raising any idea that all Germanys warprisoners were treated alike was becoming quite convinced that so far as we were con cerned enduring prison life was going to be mostly question to be solved by the capacity of our stomachs to stand up under the strain of some two and half banquets day
Joyprison it was that with the joy raised to the th power and the prison part lowered to the irreducible minimum
It was that for just one week and then it wasnt that at all
For that week think was the one to catch the wth power and that multiplied by several times what the rest were get ting out of it
For wasnt enjoying just food and drink and good stories and songs and boisterous stag dances
was enjoy ing the society of the girl
Because Corporal Rudy could get along pretty well in English because maybe he was the lieutenants cousin and in line for little favoritism but still more as figured it out because his presence pro vided chaperonage to afford his sister little change from scene that must be driving her to the verge of dementia to the comforts and the society of the brighter world aboard our yacht Cor poral Rudy was put at the head of the half dozen marines assigned to keep our prison tied to the dock
And he and the girl spent practically the whole of each day aboard with us
And had the girl to myself
She re fused to warm up to the man who had blackened her countrys navy before the officers of the navy of another country
And since Rudy and Louie seemed to hit it off together beautifully it required lit tle engineering to keep the four of us paired off exactly to my liking and almost to the satisfaction of my hearts desire
Hearts desire well there wasnt any doubt in my mind about my hearts de sire before the second days sun had set
forgave her East Side English forgot it
Not until the end of the week did discover the flattering fact that she was using my own style of conversation as model wherewith to reform her own and had already begun in her more careful moments to improve on several charac teristics of the model
She was wonder that little girl
None reflected but wonder in cleverness and versatility could have so thoroughly Americanized herself in the brief time Rudys English indicated for their Amer ican residence
None was quite sure but wonder could have got me in the depths of love to which had fallen in all but no time
had every twoyearold collegealum nuss conviction that was no susceptible boy
IT WAS WAR None but wonder was forced to admit by the end of the fourth day could have kept me from proposal of spon taneous combustion not to say explosion
knew wasnt keeping that proposal down
It was just some look in her face or quick twist in her ready wit which al ways saved me and made me choke back the earnest love talk with feeling that Id have to do it or give up the happiness of any talk at all with her
There were moments when it looked to me as if she knew she was the life and animation of this sordid wretched coal dump the only influence that was saving the station from being emptied of men by series of murders and suicides
Then guessed that she also perceived that she was losing her punch for her job that she must find some diversion or start the train of selfslaughter herself
recalled that she had snapped up Rudy unmercifully over some trifle the first morning they had come aboard
It looked to me as if she recalled similar in stances and decided that if she couldnt get on with her own brother any more she wouldnt be able to help the others much longer that it was time for her to get some diversion
At such moments was dead sure she would have much preferred that had been girl but was doing her desperate best for herself and the others with what was
But was so completely fatuously in love with her that was ready to stand for it
was her slave for life
Im not sure Id have been able to keep away from her had she entertained the bar racks with nightly imitations of my con verse of the day
In the darkest of these dark moments of belief that she was mak ing toy of me was still ready to de clare myself dividend of happiness in the thought that tomorrow would be an other day like today
Joyprison dont think Ill ever be so happy again in this world
Im not sure that Id willingly realize again that was utterly foolishly made with the sort of insane love that doesnt care how fool ishly insane it is
But it was happiness while it lasted it was happiness for week
And then If you can imagine Dr Jekyll deliver ing nice little lecture to his churchs Dorcas society and suddenly breaking off to regale them with one of Mr Hydes most richly vulgar tales you can form some notion of the way the joy went out of things aboard our yacht and that island
It was noon dinner hour and we were lunching the raiders officers in re turn for the second feast in which we helped them celebrate the capture of two or more wellprovisioned ships
We were all roaring at story of the captains when the wireless operator of the island station stepped up to Lieutenant von Hil berstein saluted and handed over mes sage
Von Hilberstein read it with smile of satisfaction growing broader with each word
It was as if only the presence of his superior prevented him from turning loose whoop of joy
He handed it to the grayhaired cap tain
The captain read it read it again as if it were too good to believe
And he did not try to prevent himself from shout ing bullthroated Hurrah The clamor for more definite informa tion was instant
Even as voiced my own eager What is it Herr Captain felt wave of hope that at last the kai sers definite peaceterms had been pub lished
It is cried the captain and there was instant silence at the resonance of his voice it is that at last our real foe is to be reached
It is that our last and sure weapon is to be wielded
It is that England is to get taste of that empti ness she has inflicted on our helpless wo men and children
It is that the soft pal avering is over about rules that England has been permitted to change at her own sweet will
It is the answer to our enemies scorn for our benevolent offers of peace
It is THE ARGOSY
the end of the war
It is victory vic tory at last made certain for the Fath erland victory over whole world full of enemies
Come meine Jugenden
Quick wine schnapps beer anything
We drink to our Wilhelm our kaiser Hoch
At last he has signed the order and published it to the world for the beginning and prosecution to the bitter end of the war of the boat The glasses had been filled with what ever drink each could reach handiest were raised even as he spoke the last words were clinking joyously to punctu ate the end of his fiery speech
Then suddenly the lips that had parted to receive the glasses fell wider open in gasp of amaze
Above the clinking and the rising murmur of satisfaction broke the voice of the girl shrill harsh fierce to the verge of fury vulgar unquestion ably in its wrathful loyalty to land that was not the home of the Uboat or theirs
May your kaisers soul bum in hell for it Down on the mahogany deck dainty glass monographed with the yachts name shattered into thousand pieces and splashed water over the feet of the offi cers
They stared at her moment in blank amaze
Many face and the captains was among them paled with rage at the unexpected insult to the high representative of all their mighty pride
And she answered them stare for stare defiant her lips parted with panted breathing her fair cheeks afire her hair in the sunlight dash of flame her eyes lambent coals
But no man capable of being the cap tain of that raider could have remained angry with wrath so pretty as hers
The captain let himself down with little chuckle
Perhaps he remembered an inestimable service she had already rendered to his cause
The others followed his example and laughed as he remarked goodhu moredly enough Our little lady doesnt like the boats She waited an instant trying to get breath for more of the sort of tirade of which she was master
Then she wheeled and went swiftly to the gang plank to the pier toward the shore
Ach Vetterchen the baron called over the rail dont go away mad He must have learned that from Rudy
She paused just long enough to bid her higherbred cousin go whither she had just consigned his emperor
But by this time all of them had awak ened to the fact that their hosts were more Americans
They had looked at us and discerned that our glasses were still full
There was an awkward silence which some of them tried to cover by drinking the toast
The lunch was begun again
Our cap torguests were even more punctiliously considerate in every word and gesture than they had been before
They plied us very gently with queries as to the atti tude of our country
They assured us very earnestly that their rulers had no wish to offend America
They declined to believe that the United States could longer fail to perceive the justice of their cause and their action
But the free and easy goodfellowship was gone
We were glad when the raider again put forth to sea
Their politeness had been at such tension it was relief to give over the effort to match it
Our storage plant was still the refrig erator for the station officers mess
Even these meals lost their spontaneity
Rudy and Mamie spent the two following days aboard the yacht as usual
But Rudy had gone stolidly silent
He no longer discussed with Louie his ambi tious plans for the day when he would get back to America
As for Mamie it seemed as if her very beauty were fading by the hour
She tried to make conversation tried to listen to mine again and again she tried and failed
At length she frankly gave up
thought again understood
IT WAS WAR Her job was done
In the very best conceivable fashion she ha been mother ing that brood of big lonely generally gloomenshrouded marines
Now they were weaned from her and she was weaned froiji them
From the beginning she had strenuously asserted that her love for the fatherland was second to her love for her adopted land
It was at noon of the third day after we had learned of the new Uboat campaign when we heard of Washingtons conse quent action in severing relations
The baron sent the word by the messenger who had carried it to him from the wire less station
With it he sent brief note of command to Rudy
There was also curt note to Louie which was sufficient to show us that we were now prisoners in deed of nation unfriendly
Humph Rudy exclaimed at reading his order
So cannot be your keeper any more
Was ist los guess this is Louie answered turn ing over the copy of the radiogram
Rudy and read it together
Humph Rudy grunted again his rather heavy features taking on trou bled expression
No he added re flectively dejectedly like that not
It is it is bad Well Louie snapped like this not
One would think that esteemed cousin of yours took it as personal in sult that his government has driven mine to break off relations Again Rudy and read together
Ma mie had crowded up and we parted our heads to let her see between us
Mr Louis Hartmann Yacht Louisa II
Sir regret that business and circumstances will prevent my lunching aboard your vessel today
May trouble you to permit my men to get from aboard the portion of the victuals which and my officers would have eaten
At my earliest possible convenience shall arrange for the transfer of the sup plies from your storage plant that there may be no unnecessary occasion for fric tion between my soldiers and your crew
trust that you will suffer no incon venience in remaining strictly aboard your vessel pending further arrangements
In doing so you will assist me in protecting your persons and property from any possi ble difficulties
Awaiting any different in structions from my superiors shall of course take all possible means to leave you unmolested in your present quarters and to afford you the fullest protection at my command
With best wishes for your comfort and wellbeing beg to sign myself esteemed sir most respectfully yours Henry von Hilberstein Lieut
It was
Rudy who first pronounced upon this document
No doubt he understood better than we the difference between an essentially official communication and the possibilities of personal intercourse
But He still plays that United States Power Squadron note was Rudys criti cism
dont like that neither Before we could quite grasp the signifi cance of his words he turned
Well it comes my relief
must say AufWiedersehn Come Mamie
We go by the electric tower again His friendly blue eyes blinked as he turned to the gangplank
Once on the pier he croaked couple of commands
His six men came stiffly together
Six other men headed by an officer in uniform similar to Rudys marched out from the always busy shore end of the pier
They paused saluted and were sa luted
Rudy and his men marched stern ly shoreward
The new six took up their places which divided the length of the yacht into tiny beats
Neither of us recalled having seen before either the new corporal or any of his little guard
The men who came shortly after with trays on which to carry off the lunch for the officers might as well have saved their scrupulous care to leave plenty for our selves
Louie and were in no mood for eating
We were in no humor for talking
We had nothing to talk about
Every body in America had long since taken for granted that the breaking of diplomatic relations would be almost instantly fol lowed by hostilities
Neither of us could THE ARGOSY
conceive any idea as to what might be our condition or our fate as prisoners of war
At least the ideas we did conceive were so unpleasant and gloomy we could not hear ourselves utter them
Prisoners of war we were
Neither of us gave himself the mad pleasure of dreaming of escape
It had been Rudys first task to put our electric equipment out of commission
Without it we could not get an explosion from one cylinder of the powerful engines one turn of pro peller
Our problems were all beyond our power to figure even on solutions
As to whether this renewed mention of the power squadron was to pave the way to ward treating us as outandout spies from nation already making hidden plans for warlike action as to whether such treatment would involve merely continuation of slightly closer confine ment than we now endured whether it would mean incarceration in dingy coops ashore while the yacht went to join the German fleet whether it would mean just backing up to wall and facing dozen rifles we could only guess
And the guessing was nothing nice to be talking about
About three oclock we had more visi tors
The lieutenant himself led them aboard the vessel
The stiff formality of his mornings note was now reflected in his rigid bearing
He curtly informed us that his men were come for the supplies
Our steward conducted him to the storage box
But supplies were not all he had come for
There had been sufficient evidence of hasty search of our vessel having taken place while it was being towed from its outside anchorage to the pier in the harbor
But the search which now proceeded under the personal eye of the baron was thorough enough to have satis fied storybook detective
Not bag or trunk or chest or draver escaped
Not scrap of paper was left unexamined
And not scrap was left aboard the vessel
Even our light vaca tion literature was removed from the walls of the saloon and borne ashore
All the captains instruments were taken the papers of clearance from Porto Rico and elsewhere the logs of all the voyages the Louisa II had made since her launching in the spring
Our main ccmpass was removed from the stand on the bridge together with the binnacle lights
Our sailing lamps were confiscated
The oars of our tenders were tossed to the pier
Even the marlinspikes were taken from our masts and any other deck tools which might possibly become weapons in any sort of free fight
No doubt the baron was acting within his rights
Our coming held at least ground for shadow of suspicion
Our escape could hardly mean anything else but the destruction of his post and that was of vast value to his government
But it is hard to see such things calmly while they are being done to you especial ly when the doer has made himself al most an intimate chum
Even though there were occasional indications that our captors stiffness toward us was pose that hardly softened the acts which ac companied the posing
The barons men were working to re move the entire wireless equipment when we were bidden to go below for search of oUr persons
When that had been ac complished clear to our skins we were al lowed to dress again and return to the deck
glance about revealed what might have been the deck of comfortable houseboat on which to loaf away sum mer at cheap resort
It seemed to have been swept clear of almost everything that could suggest real seagoing vessel
Most of the men were gone the ones who had just searched us disappeared up the gangway
The baron himself remained for last word
hope well be able to restore all these things to you again some day he said softly in his careful English
We are not really intending to confiscate them permanently IT WAS WAR That hardly melted our hearts or took the rebellion from our faces
Von Hilber steins lips quivered little and his eyes blinked as he held out his hand toward Louie who happened to be nearer him than was
Im so sorry he uttered trifle thickly
Im afraid havent even made you understand that this wasnt pleas ant duty We gave him our hands
Somehow we felt better to have him go that way
But more cheering sight than his somewhat relaxed back was the appearance of his pretty cousin at the end of the gangplank as he was about at the top of it
The baron undertook to bar the way
Look here Vetterchen you cant go aboard there any more he said sternly
Who said so she returned impu dently
Why did he tried to reply with dignity
Well just stand there second and Ill show you youre talking from wrong steer she told him
not only can go aboard that yacht but Im going But Vetterchen he argued cant have my discipline overridden completely like this
Id hate to have to punish you in any way but You bet your grandmas daguerreo type youd hate to
Id make you hate it worsen fight with buzzsaw
And look here my sweet Cousin Heiney
You said yourself lot times Ive saved this whole outfit from windin up in series of Dutch acts
Any time you want to see that little serial show start just try but tin your discipline into my goins and comins
You get that He seemed to get it
He let her pass
The pert grin had faded from her face and most of the color as she got to the deck
had to forego the idea that she was coming especially to console me
She addressed herself to Louie
Aboard she hurried us across the deck and then made sure none was near enough to listen to what she had to say
Look here you she snapped into Louies face me and Rudy want to know if theres sand enough in you an Harry here to take long chance Chance Louie repeated slowly
On what chance on beatin it out of here to night
Me and him has been doin some figurin up there in the tower
An weve got the dope out that its one in hun dred now mebbe but it wont be one in thousand after tonight
That power squadron thing has got Heiney and it ll get some of the others harder than him
Besides tomorrow theyll be double guard put on here which wont help none
So make up them minds of youm without stoppin for bastins
Are you game or aint you But the engines wont go
Our elec got all you need for your electricity hid in my clothes right now
An got some pills that ll put them guards asleep if they can be got to take drink apiece
An Rudys handlin the buttons on the minefield
It ll mean couple shots from the battery mebbe but Rudy says it ll be devil of job to hit you when you get goin at the speed you got
Its chance lot chance of your bein able to get over the anchored mines
But its heap better chance than youre likely to get again
Are you on or aint you Were on both of us whispered and added quaking guess Its no guessin about it she warned again
You got to go through it or go to hell reckon Were on we decided more firmly
Then show me stateroom where can get some of the plugs and switches out of my dainty apparel
An get your crew lined up somewhere below sos we wont lose no time on the instructions stuff
The tides at eleven tonight
Its then or never for youse As we left her at the top of compan ionway that would take her straight to the door of our spare stateroom Louie and looked up into each others face
THE ARGOSY
am free to admit that the swiftness with which the girl had fairly shoved us into this situation left me breathless dazed
held out my hand to Louie
Goodby croaked weakly
Goodby he echoed in gasp
What do you mean
Are you going to back out No of course not
Im going with you right to the end
But there might not be another chance to bid each other goodby you know
Youve been devil ish good fellow to me Louie
And Good Lord
If thats the way you feel about it wed better better He broke off
There wasnt anything better no matter how felt about it
It was war
Over nearly half the world millions of men were in some such posi tion as ours at that moment unable to guess their fates unable to alter their fates their only choice between nearly certain immediate but honorable death before and utterly certain but little de layed and dishonorable death behind
never was so totally panickily paci fist in my life
Louie and had blun dered into this infernal situation
That man should deliberately walk into re cruiting station and sign himself up for just such situations as this was the crowning example of human capacity for doing the idiotic
Thank Heaven we had little time for further reflection
Ive too vivid an im agination to figure up any more manners of death for myself than the one it is set down for me eventually to encounter
Louie had gone down the other compan ionway and had followed dumbly
We had the six members of our crew ready when Mamie came into the narrow quarters with bundle of small brasses and steels
The engineer seized them
Be getting them into place while talk she commanded
Make sure theyre all there
And just remember its hotter than this where youll be if one of them guards outside hears any tinkering For once an engineer managed to use wrenches and screwdrivers without in terfering with the conversation
Mean while the girl shot her brief instructions
Mostly they summed up in one phrase preparedness that could find and do everything in the dark
It seemed as if the real work was going to be all up to the crew
What Louie and had to do was to get back up on deck sit and chat with the girl long enough to make it appear that our time spent below had not excited us enough to signify anything suspiciously interesting afoot
The crew had to arrange the hold and make every adjustment possible with out an actual trial of the motors
This must be done under cover of get ting supper
And then it was up to them to get on such terms with the guard that would come on duty at eight oclock that the offer of few drinks would be accept able
Theirs the hard part
Not if you ask me
It was all very well while the girl kept up perfect phonographic perform ance of mirthful quip and loud laughter
But when she left about half past four with another hour of daylight left well the next time Im fixing to take my life and spin it on the end of one finger Ill let the crew come up and look perfectly natural while go down and sweat around the engine
And then to eat dinner please spare the tale
At length the crew came up and made its way to the little afterdeck
With them they carried clinking bottles and heavy glasses
The night guard had come on halfhour before
Suddenly realized that here was the weakness of our plan or the weakest of all its weaknesses
Successfully to drug seven men so that they will all drop to sleep at once or nearly enough so to pre vent any one of them becoming alarmed at his companions condition wished the girl would come down to help us do it
wished it the more as time went on
Hope grew when chorus of voices up at headquarters sent strident chords out into the sticky air
They must be trying to console themselves thought for losing IT WAS WAR us
But their singing would have its psy chological effect on the seven men who cheerless themselves though with good cheer within arms reach must know their superiors were thoroughly enjoying them selves
Our men took it out in loud laughter in requests for schnapps or beer in tone that could not fail to reach the audi ence above
But it was an unconscionably long time before we saw one of our guar dians step to the edge of the pier to look down on their mirth
Tom Healey tried to make something of this slender opportunity
Hello up there he called goodhu moredly
Wollen trinken It was probably the limit of his Ger man
had learned enough in the past week to catch the drift of the sour re sponse Not with the enemies of my father land Oh Lord groaned Louie in my ear
That settles it
Hes put the bug in their ears
Once give Dutchman the idea that eating his dinner is disloyal to something he ought to be loyal to and hell starve to death
reckon know
My father But great Heaven
What are we going to do now
Its after nine
Weve got to be moving at tenthirty or miss the top of the tide
We cant jump up there and expect to get away with silent fight that will knock out as many of them as there are of us
Oh what fool was not to see this
Surely Rudy never worked out this part of the deal
That girl must have been reading nickel libraries all her life
Dope seven men all at once
Well this settles us It was my turn to try to encourage though must say couldnt just locate the cheer stuff to use for the job
If she planned this you can bet your last dollar she will see it through prophesied in as nearly as possible tone of belief in what could not help realiz ing was not so
And then as if had brought it about by speaking it the girl was there
My heart almost stopped as heard her clear voice answering the challenge of the cor poral
Oh thought you boys would be lone some so far away from the fun
Anyhow dont feel up to batting with those bunches tonight
Who are you all here anyhow
Hello Hans Hello Gus why Karl
Did they stick you down here with them Americans too could catch her German words be tween those she spoke in English
Her tone was one to make man forget any but the most important duties to his fatherland or his own father
What you got to drink she asked when they had all got within easy hear ing of her voice
What coffee
Nichts besser als das
Ach Gott in Himmel
want real drink
Hey you Ameri cans
Hand us up something wet before you all get so gebummelt you dont know your bottles from your glasses
Say youve got some swell notions of prison life down there aint you
Give us some wine
Give us some of that bitter wine off the Italian ship
liked that
Bet none of you ever tasted it
Just imagine its wops blood and it ll go down good
Hey goin to get that wine or aint you
Well come down and take it if you say so Charley Prince our steward nearly toppled down the companionway to the galley calling back to know if there were clean glasses on deck just as we had in structed should be done in order that the glasses should be the ones we held in readiness
He hurried back with an armload of bottles
Tom Healey came up with tray
We handed him seven mugs that tinkled as We
tried to hold them
And heres one wineglass for the lady Louie mentioned genially as he added it to the trayful of mugs each moist at the bottom with the water it had taken to soften chloral tablet
Charley waited on them with the grace THE ARGOSY
of Broadway headwaiter
Then came the suspense
The Uboat Hochl the girl cried with au apparent fervor to surpass their own enthusiasm for their pet engines of destruction
Hoch she urged und trink aus
For some of them had hesitated as they tasted the strange wine with its stranger drug
Her final command was all but compelling
Those who hesitated were lost
But there was one Louie pointed to him and whispered in my ear He hasnt touched his mug The glass stood full on pilehead
That fact with all its possible train of fatal dangers had hardly dawned upon my freshfrighted brain when the girl also saw
Whats the matter with you Otto
Dont you like the Uboat
Why dont you drink
Maybe you dont like the kaiser yet she flung at him in voice that seemed almost dangerously accusing
drink not the wine of my father lands enemies grunted the stem throat of the man
Its the one with the bug Louie whispered
Well never do anything with him
Shes wasting her breath he finished impatiently as she continued to urge Aw come on Otto
Youll drink anything with me
didnt think youd turn me down like that
Boys fill up again
Ottos going to drink to an Amer ican girl if he wont drink to America She filled her own tjny glass
She got up from the heavy timber that formed low bulkhead over the end of the pier and approached the stolid upholder of the last jot of principle
She lifted his glass from the spiles cap
She held it toward him
Youre going to drink to me Otto she insisted
Here Ill hold it for you
If you dont drink Ill never speak to you again He backed little away from her
could guess how foolish she was making him feel
He was old enough to be her father
She followed him and he backed farther grunting disgusted protests at her of the nuisance she was making of her self
he kept growling but he was the one
who was going back ward
For an instant let my eyes wander from the pair
Already the strong dose of narcotic was taking its effect
One of the men had tottered
Another bending over him and trying to speak gave up and sprawled across him
third pressed his heavy palms to his forehead and kneeled over
fourth How long was it going to take Otto to perceive this
swung my gaze
He was still dancing clumsily backward from the girl
Suddenly caught her purpose
Louie and the men in the little afterdeck had caught it already and were standing ready to catch him
He reached the edge of the pier
With out waiting to see if he would discover his danger or go and plunge off himself the girl raised the heavy mug of vermodth and thrust it wine and all into his very eyes
The waiting crew hardly let his boots clatter against the railing as they seized him
Billy Nock not always too ready of mind was ready now with bandanna handkerchief for our guards mouth
Quick now get their guns cut the ropes quick The girls voice was weak whisper as she held herself together to remind us of the need of haste
Louie and both jumped to the pier with two of the others
The girls trembling fingers snatched two of the guns from the limp hands that held them
But we were at the ropes with carvingknives we had specially whetted for our dinner roast
In split seconds we were getting back aboard
felt as if had served through war already
The hum of the starters gears came muffled from the engineroom
wanted to lie down and faint after the strain
But realized we were just at the beginning point
IT WAS WAR looked about and discerned that Louie was but halfway down the gangplank and that Mamie really had fainted
sprang to his assistance to get her aboard
Was she going with us gasped
Shell have to now Louie spoke in tone bordering on despair
But he left me to get the exhausted girl to long seat where she could lie down and turned to help the men who were shoving off the gangplank
They left it dangling down the side of the pier
The work of bringing the girl hack to consciousness kept my mind for mo ment off the terrible thunder of battle that would wait but seconds until we were dis covered
leap to the low afterdeck procured me bottle of whisky and had it to her lips before the engines had backed us off the piers end and we were starting with reckless jerk full speed ahead
The touch of burning liquor on her lips brought her to
With frightened glance about her she sat up still panting weakly
Rudy wheres Rudy she gasped
Why Mamie you fainted and we couldnt leave you on the pier and Oh thats all right
Im going with you
But Rudy where are we Were only about hundred yards off the pier as yet but its almost another hundred while Im telling it
And Once more was interrupted
shot rang out bullet whined above the rig ging
ducked involuntarily
Oh this is all right Mamie was say ing cheerfully
The fun hasnt started yet But it had by the time she was finished with the words
It seemed suddenly as if the whole harbor had become crackling riflepit
The lights of the pier were turned on full as
when the raider was being loaded at night
By now however we had got far enough away so that the arcs hardly helped the heavily clouded moonlight to reveal our white hull
Hoarse shouts blended with the rifle fire
To this was added the heavier boom of threeinch gun from one of the little concrete pits in the great coalpile
That was answered doubly by pair of its like on the opposite side of the harbor
For an instant the startling terror of the thing had rendered me incapable of speech
Then the terror seemed to have died out
couldnt believe that all this was being aimed at us
had been trying to ask the girl to let me help her below deck out of danger
Now though the phosphorescent splashes darted up all around us couldnt see any danger
felt as if Mamie would laugh at me if suggested it
Then the twang of bullet from the rail within six inches of myjand served to put me into something like proper re lation with the situation
was no longer scared didnt seem to be afraid save for the girl
Id better take you below shouted in her ears
The wicked rattle of machinegun had joined the song of death
They may need me on the bridge she answered
But that she thoroughly understood the nature of our danger she showed by climbing down from the settee instead of standing up
She crawled forward toward the raised section that overlooked the pilothouse this last being in reality the main saloon
We reached there just in time
bul let flattened against the mast just behind this bridge and still carried strength to knock the captain senseless over his wheel
It happened as we arrived
Hes headed wrong anyhow the girl cried to Louie
Theres rocks over yon der She snatched the wheel and began to help Louie turn it
Get him waked up again she bade me
Well need him unless one of you can steer by chart and compass Well need him Louie put in
Weve neither chart nor compass left
This will be steering by the stars and there arent any stars tonight THE ARGOSY
Oh why but had compass the girl exclaimed
its there yet she laughed
Not much of one but it steered one boat down here She turned aside to fish it from her stocking
Is that the compass you had Louie asked as she showed him an instrument few sizes larger than mans watch
Ill give you two thousand dollars for that any day you want to sell The captain was restored as quickly as the girl had been
stood wondering what about compass could make Louie and the girl so oblivious to our danger as that he should offer twenty times its worth and she should refuse with death playing tag with us
In righting our course we had run lit tle close to shore
Instantly another ma chinegun began to spew its stream of lead along us
For it had our range
From fore to aft and back again it swept at height some two feet above the deck level
We first knew what effect it was taking from the sharp rattle on the steel bulwark Louie had put along the sides of the bridge for the naval maneuvers
An instant later there was series of dull clinks that told of plateglass cabin being punctured by bullets too swift to break them
Then the deadly stream was leading forward again toward us
It was fascinatingly horrible an invis ible knife that sawed its way toward us
Again the dull snapping of glass duller drubbing through mahogany straight line of lambent splatter in the water be yond while the drill of bullets found noth ing to stop them forward of the cabin in the rear of the spacious deck
Then quick stab of fire as if whitehot needle had darted through and out of the calf of my left leg brought startled yell of pain hardly felt
Why the devil didnt you duck snarled Louie
And perceived that the others had flattened themselves against the false pilothouse behind the protection of the short steel bulwark while had but stood and waited to be shot
Dont tell me you can make soldier over night
It takes training to know what is dangerous
The captain had some of that training having managed to be in al most everything that happened in the SpanishAmerican war
Mamie had it because she had been absorbing it from surroundings wholly military
Louie had ducked properly because the captain had pushed him where he be longed
Im not hurt any answered easily
Just nipped the skin on my leg But five minutes later was taking sur reptitious swallows from the flask to keep myself upstanding until we were beyond this rain of death
And now we were reaching the mouth had almost said nipple of the harbor
sharp turn made under the girls direc tion had put ridge of coal between us and the interior which evidently had seen us plainly enough to know we were gone since its firing ceased instantly
Heres where we catch the big fel lows the girl uttered calmly
And dead ahead its straight out now is the grandfather of all the mines
hardly think theyll waste that on us But it flashed upon me that they would be more apt to use everything they had on us than on an attacking vessel
For we were going away and they believed we would send back an attacking fleet
Yet in spite of that it was the cannon for which was waiting when the explo sion came
The tremendous cloud of flame was to tally blinding
The yacht seemed to stop dead as if it had run into stone moun tain
All four of us crashed against the pilothouse
We had bruises that would last us long while if all or any of us lasted with the bruises
And the noise of the explosion It was like nothing else had ever heard
For had heard all the other noises
Hearing could not compass this
We felt it
It shook every fiber of our bodies with IT WAS WAR shock quite distinct from that of our bump
Somehow it seized every nerve and bone and sinew
It seemed as if the whole of lifes en ergy had been blown out of me and left me standing
hadnt strength to put the bottle of stimulant again to my lips
And Louie the imperturbable could hear his teeth rattling together as if in chill
The captain hardly yet completely re covered from the stunning he had got few moments earlier sat motionless where he had fallen
The girls shaking hand was laid on my shoulder in her effort to rise
It lost its grip and had to catch her with an
effort that called for strength which had left me
It could not have been more than fraction of second but it seemed deadly hour before the engines recover ing from the sudden load on the propel lers first in spasmodic coughs then in more regular rhythm at length in their normal purr settled down to their heroic test of dependability
Is that the engines Louie gasped faintly
Then he added They wont run long
That did for us Im not so sure argued the captain from wider range of experience with the sensations of the sea
That was Rudy and he missed us purpose the girl now whispered
Give him little light aft and hell miss us some more if they dont chase him out of there too soon on account of that miss God hoarsely ejaculated the cap tain hope he misses us little farther next time
Another shake up like that The two sixinch guns on the opposite sides of the harbors mouth spoke almost at once
It did seem as if the Louisa II was getting more than she had ever been built to take
Once more the whole craft shivered as shell exploded directly over her stem
We forgot the scattering bits of steel in our efforts to cling fast to the railings and stanchions
The automatic pumps are starting Louis Hartmann remarked moment later
Since they would not run until there was water for them to take their running now showed that the terrific shocks had opened seams
We didnt need any ballast for getting over whats ahead Then it seemed as if we all settled into sort of apathy that no longer cared what became of us
The next attempts of the larger guns to find our range were total failures
Somehow their very noise seemed to have weakened
second mine exploded couple of hundred feet to the right of our course
doubt if any of us batted strained eye
We knew that we were drawing deeper than when we had first approached the island we were making no attempt to dodge those mines we might set off by contact
There was no means by which we could have dodged them
Two more of the mines under electric control from shore blew up
doubt if one of us noted the relative positions of their explosions and our boat
We just waited to see which second would bring death and waited more seconds indif ferent whether they brought death or no
Well came from the captains lips in voice that rattled across cords half paralyzed were good ten miles off shore and out of the way of the mines
The patrol boat you say wont be back around before twelve
Wed better find out what we can as to what shape were in for getting back to Key West
And the engineers ought to have chance to give the machines the onceover before we start any racing again Not word or sigh of relief from any one that our worst danger was over just reminder that our work might be mo mentarily changed to advantage
None of us felt any relief
We were just numb
Well put in the girl we got to wait for Rudy and them now anyhow Rudy Louie and gasped together
How do you mean You dont suppose Id be here if he wasnt cornin die snorted
THE ARGOSY
How The motor tender
Its been layinin little creek on the back of the island ever since you two fell ashore off it
Rudy and Willie and Adolf theyre all coming in it Louie and looked at each other in sur prise
Then we quit it
We didnt really care enough whether we took Rudy and Willie and Adolf or not to be surprised about it
Louie had made it point to maintain crew of United States citizens that there be no possibility of trouble or delay with any of the foreign warvessels so generously sprinkled along our coast
Rudy and and the other two were Ger mans
An Allies cruiser might make de mands upon us for their surrender as war prisoners
We didnt care
The engineers below decided that the engines were still ready to turn up their allotted number of revolutions per minute
One of the clutches was being tightened
The leaks were gaining just trifle on the automatic pumps
But barring heavy storms we ought to keep afloat as we were straight to New York if we so de sired
We didnt
Key West would do us
But we didnt care wher we went or how we got there
And then we had to begin caring all over
From somewhere behind the island now quite invisible in the drk and half mist long shaft of light stretched it self toward the west lifted described half circle and dipped to the east came back dropped vanished flashed hither and yonder and finally revealed its source in white point of tense light now clear of the island
The patrol boat Mamie whispered
Then sudden idea flashed into her brain and whirled her query upon Louie How fast cn that little tender youm travel About twelve miles an hour Louie responded
For an instant we had turned on such lights as we needed now she stared at Hartmann as if the thing he announced were too monstrous to believe
Then she arose and swiftly crossed to where she got an unobstructed view of the performances of the patrols searchlight
She dropped into deckchair there so weakly that was not sure she had not fainted
set my numbed muscles into motion to follow her and give any aid could
When could see her face her whole figure seemed to have collapsed into huddle of misery from which only the dark eyes emitted the slightest ray of life
If youd just turn that light off it shines in my eyes she responded to my offer of help
With the light turned out she drew herself into yet more shriveled and for lorn heap
She continued to stare fixedly at the ever shifting searchray
Huddled as she was she looked cold
hurried below and returned with rug which adjusted over her shoulders
She made no effort to help or hinder me
But nevertheless performing the little act of protection warmed my love to the verge of flame
An hour ago had indeed revived her from faint but now had time to be and to feel tender in what did
It was sentiment her tense spirit had given me no previous opportunity to indulge
It was the sentiment every man likes best to indulge toward the woman he loves
laid my hand over the tiny cold one she rested on the side of her chair while her shoulders and face hunched forward to watch for the beginnings of the next race for life
He has always the chance that he can come straight while the gunboat is dodging the mines broke the silence once to suggest
There are plenty of straight courses out from the island for that boat she corrected dishearteningly
And the race was more disheartening
The weather had cleared little enough so that we could discern the white hull of the little tender the instant the gunboats searchlight located it
The tender was IT WAS WAR about four miles off shore then the gun boat quite close in
But one could have figured the race from the start
The patrol had twice the speed of the tender
That the three men in the tender made any run at all could but be accounted for by deliberate intention to be taken dead rather than alive
From the very bottom of my heart wished that Rudy had been satisfied to fight on for his own country
The tender was not much more than halfway to us when the forward twoinch guns of the patrol boat opened fire
That did not deter the men in the tender at all
They kept on with their flight
We could see their silhouettes now out lined in the broken reflections of the big lamp behind them
Two crouched low and close to the little engine the third forward crouched over the wheel
hated to try to imagine what their grim faces must look like
The biggest of the patrolboats guns spoke again
splinter shot upward from the stem of the tender and the three crouched lower
At the third round plank was shivered for half its length
But now the race was too nearly over for further flight
The desperate men in the tender without diminishing speed faced behind them and guns to shoulders began to pump bullets at the glaring lamp
It was clever stroke
The light van ished at the first feeble volley from the three guns
Though the white of the boat might be near enough for target the men themselves could no longer be seen by the pursuer
Of boats or men we could see nothing at all
All the while our course had been almost athwart that of the oncoming craft
Now we had crossed their line and the captains telegraph had buzzed the signal below for threequarters speed ahead
For we must not get in range of the patrols twoinchers
Of all three boats we must be the most visible for we must make it possible for Rudy and his two companions to see us so long as there was chance of their reaching us
few moments more of waiting ensued
Then the guns of the patrol vessel spoke sharply
The flashes seemed turned trifle to orte side
In this last darkness the girl had got up and gone silently to the rail
We glimpsed pale light apparently showing through the open door of the deckhouse and indicating that the pa trolboat had turned sharp in her course
While was trying again to focus my eyes on the spot the end came
It was one more flare of horrible flame one more detonation that tortured the ears
And in that flare both boats were plainly visible their bows almost together and raised high into the air their frames and sides seeming to collapse in shapeless masses
There were great ugly howls of men in pain unspeakable then silence
steadied the girl back into the seat once more wrapped her in the big rug then sat beside her
laid my hand com fortingly upon the cold little one on her chairs arm
But this time she seemed conscious of the gesture and drew her hand away and for while sat staring at it uneasily
The captain touched my shoulder
Mr Hartmann wants to speak to you he announced almost gruffly
He took my chair as headed for the bridge
Well what is it asked dully
Its just this Harry
want you to let that poor girl alone not to bother her with any more of your damned nice attentions to keep out of her way at all events while shes aboard my yacht was almost too astonished for words
When they came my astonishment had turned mostly to anger
dont know what you mean snapped
Im not aware of annoying any one with unwanted attentions
could imagine something of what blow that out there was to her
wanted to do anything could for her And what in the devil do you think THE ARGOSY
you can do for grief like hers came back from my old chums lips
Youve got wonderful respect for your imagination it seems to me
suppose you imagine you love her Its none of your business if Say he cut me off havent you really ever heard of the way she came to be down here in the first place Why why no
dont think she has told me confessed
Well Ill tell you
Rudy and those other two there were six of them at the start got wind of the existence of this coaling station somewhere down here
All of them were reserve men of course
They hadnt much money but they had whole lot of patriotism that wasnt get ting the slightest exercise up in the United States
So they concocted the fool scheme to sail down the Keys from Florida in rickety old catboat with kicker in it
That wouldnt have been any worse than lots of other things only Mamie wouldnt let Rudy come unless hed bring her along and he was still loony enough about the thing to bring her in order to get here himself
And even that might not have been so bad in fact weve been seeing it work out very nicely in the end
But some thing went wrong with the engine of the catboat just when there was tenday calm for which theyd been too low in funds to provide against with decent ra tions for the two days theyd figured for the run they were making
And well Im not going to go into details right now havent time
They got ashore finally
It was Rudy that managed to sail the boat into some sort of port
And two of the men were dead three more and the girl were in delirium of starvation
And the folks that got them out of their boat made queer dis covery
The girl still had plenty of food
She had it tucked in little bag she carried on her lap
It was her food too her por tion of the rations they doled them selves out when the bunch began to real ize its plight
And somehow by one lie one time and another lie another time she had kept Rudy eating something enough to hold soul and body and brain together right along
And he hadnt known that shed gone without herself to accomplish it
Do you think youve got anything to console that sort of love with
Dont you think theres time somewhere when your cheap flirtations are bit out of place Flirtations echoed indignantly
After all he had but added capsheaf to my own estimate of the girl
Maybe Im something of an ass but Ive meant to marry that girl if anything could ever induce her to take me Marry her Louies jaw dropped
He stared at me in blank noncomprehen sion
Well maybe you could now
But before now
Why what do you mean Well dont know as IM let you stop me
Im pretty sure wouldnt want to let our baron lieutenant chap back there take her away from me
And dont see why her brother should seriously object to me if she didnt Brother
Who Louie insisted crazily
My God
You didnt think Rudy was her brother did you And before my bewildered brain could even then grasp the truth it was borne in upon me in the tone of womans voice
It was voice dead and hollow with long vigil and strain and anxiety hoarse and weak and thin
The girl was at the rail again as she cried ut her fingers point ing toward something none of us could as yet see or hear
Rudy It was voice to call man back from the dead
And the cheerfullooking rather overenthusiastic and distinctly sensationloving young man who was swimming toward the lights of our boat was her husband
Well he spoke simply as we got him aboard guess now got to fight for my new country Pkuing tKejyaiv bif Joseph
Ivers Lawrence SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTERS ALREADY PRINTED
AVID TREVES returns to his home in New York after seven years devoted to his education in England
The period is and he is strongly Tory in his sympathies so that when Dale Kirby declines to drink toast to King George there is trouble at once and duel
But David discharges his pistol into the ground and thereby placates the friends of his cousin Godfrey with whom and the latters wife Caroline he has taken up his residence
But on the arrival of courier with news of the outburst of the Liberty men at Lexington there is such excitement in the New York colony that David decides to betake himself to the home of Nathaniel Winnington wellknown Tory whose daughter Jessica he has recently met and for whose safety he is troubled
Things quiet down after bit and he returns to the Wall Street house which however in the course of the next year reverts to his cousin Godfrey when David declines to subscribe to the patriots pledge put up to him by General Lee
He is proscribed and goes out into the suburbs to live with the Murrays at Incleberg whither after skirmish his patriot friend Adrian Ingold betakes himself for refuge
David insists on seeing the wounded man back to the Continental lines and in doing so gets safeconduct pass from the British commander Sir Henry Clinton
This however works to his undoing when next day he is captured by the Americans
CHAPTER XIV
WANTED MIRACLE
AT Adrian Ingolds suggestion the scouting party conducted David to the American headquarters on Har lem Heights
The two horses of the fallen British troopers were caught and Ingold mounted one and rode away down the valley to look for his own command
The other horse was given to the pris oner and as the battle on the heights was growing in violence and spreading toward the valley the party headed for the oppo site heights at good pace
On top of the rocky elevation north of the valley known as Point of Rocks David saw group of mounted officers one of them being particularly conspicuous by his superior height and by the milky whiteness of his charger
General Washington believe said David casually to the captain who rode at his side
Ask me no questions sir was the answer an Ill not have to offend you with ungracious replies David nodded understandingly and kept silent for the rest of the ride
But he viewed with interest the hastily thrown This story began in the March Argosy Argosy THE ARGOSY
up fortification on the successive eleva tions of the heights and when his captors halted on knoll to observe the valley they had quitted he was permitted to look for himself
Lowhanging smoke clouds now ob scured the Hollow Way to large extent but bodies of troops were moving rapidly in huge patches of kaleidoscopic color and it took but moment to determine that the rebels were once again in re treat
The heavy firing ceased little by little and the smoke cleared and pres ently fanfare of British bugles rang out from the middle of the valley in notably tuneful call
Whats that theyre sounding cap tain asked one of the Virginians
Why damn their insolence mut tered the captain dejectedly its no mili tary call its the foxhunters call at the close of the hunt
They think theyve bagged their foxes but well show em yet
He scowled angrily as he saw suspi cion of smile on Davids face and at his surly command the party turned about and continued the ride at swinging trot
As the captive had vaguely surmised their destination was the Morris mansion which was now the center of the rebel camp with the beautiful lawns cluttered with light ordnance supply wagons and nondescript camp paraphernalia
They trotted into the yard passed around the house to the large barns and dismounted
guard officer came from the barns and received the Virginia captains report
He was informed of the circumstances of the capture and he read the pass that was evidently so incriminating and ordered soldier to conduct the prisoner to an im provised cell in the large barn
The cell was room some ten feet square which had evidently been used as small granary
There was keg in one comer for the prisoner to sit on and be fore he had been there many minutes soldier came in and placed jug of water on the floor
Then David was left to his peculiar reflections for several hours
They were not pleasant nor yet notably melancholy for he could hardly take the situation as gravely serious
If he had to spend long time in such prison he would sorely miss his luxurious quarters at Incleberg but he felt that his incarceration could not extend over many days
The true and softhearted Adrian would get him out by hook or crook before he was subjected to any positive hardship and the chances seemed strong that his friend would not permit him to pass single night in such place
He heard many sounds of excursions and alarms outside the barn
Bodies of horse and foot passed along the road and after one burst of shouting and trumpet calls he made out that horses were hastily attached to the light artillery pieces in the yard and driven away at great pace
About noon as he figured the time continuous and aweinspiring din was borne across the hills
The rattle of musketry became steady tattoo and was punctuated by jarring salvos of artillery fire
He listened with eager interest but as the apparently considerable engagement continued without abatement he became vaguely anxious
It seemed highly probable that the reb els would be annihilated or put to rout and he scarcely relished the idea of being rescued by men of his own political sym pathies at time when he might find ex planations difficult
If the cavalry patrol that had pursued him returned to head quarters and described him accurately he might fare worse among his friends than with the enemy
For an hour or more the battle thunder rolled without intermission then it fluctu ated growing fainter in the distance or louder with probable shifting of positions
At last it subsided gradually and ceased
He heard men cheering near the barn and galloping horsemen shrieked out tid ings of victory as they approached
It was incredible the listener thought yet it seemed to be true
Then came another fanfare of trumpets somewhere on the heights and fresh bursts PLAYING THE MAN
of cheering
The rebels were replying in kind to the British taunts of the morning the buglers were sounding the victorious call of the fox chase
After an hour of bustle and hilarious confusion about the place he heard horses entering the yard and the name of Wash ington was roared out by hundred hoarse voices
David sat down on his keg and shook his head in puzzled be wilderment
It was too preposterous for belief but of certainty there had been great battle and it seemed that General Washington had won the day
soldier came into the cell as darkness fell and put down piece of bread and jug of fresh water
have heard sounds of great rejoic ing David said to him quietly
Did your troops succeed very brilliantly to day The soldier grinned but leered at the prisoner with contemptuous air
The kings men will not stop running this fortnight Im thinking he said
Certain it is they wont come this way soon again David was eager for more detailed in formation but the man turned about abruptly and left him alone again
The bread was dry but David was hungry and he ate it all washed down with hearty drafts of the cool water
It grew dark and he had no light
He was cramped from sitting so long on the keg and when it seemed that he was to have no bed fir blanket he took off his full skirted coat spread it on the dusty floor and stretched himself wearily upon it
little later came more considerate visitor
It was the captain who had taken him prisoner and he brought small candlelantern coarse blanket and porringer of stewed beans
Here Mr Treves he said not un kindly Im commander of the guard for the night and Ive no wish that my pris oners should suffer
You can be bit thankful to his excellency too for hes in high good humor ever the victory and hes given orders that all prisoners shall be treated kindly even spies shall try to prove to your satisfac tion that Im far from being the latter captain returned the prisoner
The officer smiled but shook his head
wish you luck sir he said but Id not be in your shoes for anything can think on
Youll appear before the court martial tomorrow believe and the the execution of the sentence is us ually carried out the same day Come youre rather gloomy for night visitor David exclaimed half facetiously
should dislike to think that tomorrow would end for me before sunset
cant think that Im such desperate enemy to your cause The one little paper that found on you convicts you sir said the officer soberly
dont see what could save you short of blessed miracle To his surprise David almost smiled
He was thinking of the faithful Adrian as blessed miracle and his mind was not disturbed by misgivings or by the gloomy predictions of his jailer
Come come captain said David dont let my plight cast gloom over you
Im an optimist by nature and shall not give up hope until feel the noose
As loyal subject of King George really should be most dejected over the ill fortune to his arms today
Believe me cant comprehend it
thought that Sir William had struck at last with an army that could do no less than overwhelm you The captains eyes sparkled in the lanternlight
It ll take more than mere numbers to overwhelm us Mr Treves he said
They crowed too early in the day and they paid dearly for it
The heights around Bloomingdale are littered with red coats tonight poor fellows thatll never fight again
We fought em for two hours running hand to hand sir in buckwheat field just above the Hudson River bank and then we chased em
Theyre THE ARGOSY
back in the city tonight and they wont come out again tomorrow nor the nex day
It wasnt cheap victory for us though he continued more soberly
We lost some fine fellows although our losses were mere nothing compared to theirs
Some of our officers say that we might not have won the fight had it not been for the rare work of Colonel Knowl ton of the Connecticut Rangers and poor fellow
he fell in the second assault
Major Leitch of our Virginia fellows went to reinforce him and he fell at the same time
But their men went on fight ing and God be thanked
we got the victory Its terrible business declared David solemnly
Ah you may well say so returned the captain
Blood and murder in land that ought to be blooming in peace and plenty
and all for that pigheaded dolt that wears the British crown
Do you mind that officer that we saved from the redcoat cavalrymen this morning just before we captured you sir
Very well indeed answered David coolly
He was from my own colony of Vir ginia Major Ingold as true man as ever knew went on the officer and he fell sir in that accursed buckwheat field leading his men against the British bayonets There was an instant of tense silence
The candle in the lantern guttered and almost flickered out
The officer heard something like stifled sob
Is anything the matter with you Mr Treves inquired the captain squinting curiously through the half light
There was no answer and the officer leaned closer to his prisoner
he exclaimed Ive quite un nerved you sir
But vow your emo tion does you credit
suppose these things sound more terrible to civilian gentleman than they do to us that are in the beastly business
Death is around us all the time and it comes quick to us
Well sir Ill leave you
wish our ac quaintance might have been pleasanter can see that youre man with heart David heard the door close and the key click in the lock and then he clasped his hands convulsively to his head and threw himself upon the blanket at full length
My poor poor Adrian he groaned in an agony of grief
Poor lad
that you had to be one of the first to go And then suddenly he caught his breath in gasp and sat up
With more of amazement than horror he realized his own predicament
He was in fair way to be sentenced to death on the morrow and there was not one man who could prove that he entered the rebel lines to serve rebel officer
CHAPTER XV
THE FOEMANS WAY
AT noon next day David Treves stood in the big courtmartial room of Gen eral Washingtons headquarters it had been Mrs Morriss famous drawingroom and heard the president of the court declare that he stood convicted as British spy
Your deportment before this board has been that of gallant gentleman sir the officer observed and my profound sympathy goes out to you
It is not our wish to appear vindictive or brutally se vere and as you may have friends with whom you would communicate would not deprive you of sufficient time to do so
It is the sentence of this court sir that three days hence at sunrise you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead The pallor of death was on Davids face but he uttered no sound his shoulders remained square to the front and his head retained its courageous poise
If the prisoner has anything to say spoke up one of the officers of the board let him speak now Davids chest heaved as he took deep breath and he moistened his lips
PLAYING THE MAN
With your indulgence gentlemen he began slowly in low voice would ask very great favor favor that may well be too great for you to grant
My only hope lies in certain things that might say to one man and that man is General Washington If you hope to win clemency sir by giving up certain information with re gard to the enemy said one of the officers gravely such proposal should be made to this court not to General Washing ton You misjudge me sir David re plied in firmer tone
am not one to barter honor for life in such manner
It was my pleasure to meet his excellency on certain occasion and what would say to him now is private matter be tween one gentleman and another
could say it only to General Washington The president of the court shook his head almost sorrowfully
Such requests are not uncommon Mr Treves he said and fear that it would be difficult for you to gain the desired audience with the commanderinchief
However shall include your request in my report and if possible will see that it comes to the notice of his excellency He nodded to the officer at the door as he finished speaking and the prisoner was led quickly from the room and conducted to his cell in the barn where he sat down on his blanket and remained for long time in state of dumb stupefaction
Hours passed and he thought with con stantly increasing agony of Jessica and of the few good friends who would sin cerely mourn his untimely and undeserved death
And his grief for the death of his friend did not cease
He and Adrian Ingold had known each other but few months more than year yet their friendship had been of rare quality surviving even those vital differ ences of thought and action which com monly serve to break the most fraternal bonds
In his extremity of anguish and emotion he permitted himself even to wonder if Adrians ideals had been more just and true than his
For himself he was loyal to the crown because his fathers had been sc before him but Adrians ancestry had been no less loyal
He had lived in rare old England aqd been educated in British ideas and spirit but so had Adrian
He believed the colonies to be indubitably the possessions and dependencies of Britain as essentially British as the British Isles but Adrian had been an older man and wiser man and Adrian had seen the future of Ameri ca all bright and glorious in the liberty and independence of selfgoverned nation
The slender ray of sunlight that pene trated the tiny hole that served as window near the top of the cell now lay horizontally in the dustladen air and the sufferer thought dully that the afternoon was waning
Then as the beam of light grew more golden soldier came and unlocked the door
Come out prisoner he commanded
Ive orders to take you before his ex cellency General Washington
Make haste David sprang up with cry of hope and relief
Never fear my friend he said haste is too slow word for me at such moment He was unshaven his hair lacked powder and his good black coat was creased and dusty but he entered the Morris mansion again with the spring and vigor of new hope in his step and carriage
The house was full of officers and despatch bearers were darting in and out but General Washington was found sitting alone in the large room on the left of the entrance
You will wait outside the door which you may close said the commanderin chief to the soldier as they entered and then he bowed gravely to David without rising and waved him courteously to chair
regret that our second meeting is so inauspicious Mr Treves said the rebel THE ARGOSY
leader quietly and with deep note of sincerity in his voice
readily recalled you from your name you were friend of the gallant Major Ingold whose death added so greatly to our loss in yester days engagement with the enemy David bowed sorrowfully scarcely trusting himself to speak
You will understand sir said Wash ington that almost every man convicted of espionage is inclined to regard his case as exceptional and that he almost invaria bly craves the privilege of laying his plea before the highest authority
If were to yield to every petition of the sort my time would suffer an appreciable cur tailment
may say however that in deference to the memory of Major Ingold have made this exception in your case
You will oblige me by being as brief as possible Mr Treves If the interview avails me nothing your excellency said David fervently shall leave your presence happier for this mark of your consideration
will be very brief sir
could not tell my story to other men without the danger of compromising certain innocent persons but feel that it is safe in your hands He then told hurriedly in terse sen tences how Adrian Ingold had been sheltered by those distinguished Tories the Murrays how he had been prepared for his perilous journey to the rebel lines and how finally he himself had gone forth with him to afford support and guidance
Without pause and with convincing earnestness he told the story to the end then fell grimly silent
General Washington eyed him with earnest intensity throughout the recital
At the end he bowed his head and was thoughtful for some minutes
The most important phases of your experience Mr Treves he said sudden ly but kindly are those which followed your departure from the house of Mr Murray
Major Ingold unhappily is no longer with us
General Sir Henry Clin ton might an he would bear testimony to the incident of
the pass which seems to have been somewhat irregular
But could any one vouch for your movements from the time you left the British out post to the moment of your arrest David shook his head
Major Ingold and were alone sir until the final pursuit and skirmish he said
Washington sighed audibly
The most unpleasant thing we have to experience in the exercise of high authori ty Mr Treves he said is the official hardening of the heart
Our own impulses our own best inclinations have to be thrust aside with ruthless hand David bowed silently and got up
beg your excellency to believe he said that am not lacking in gratitude for the attention and consideration that you have shown me Mr Treves said Washington with deep feeling as between man and man believe every word that you have spoken
As General Washington can believe nothing until have seen the conclusive proof
hope however that may lighten your heart little before you re turn to your place of confinement
shall give orders sir postponing the ex ecution of the courts sentence to one week from this day and shall privately make some investigation of your case if find that such an investigation is possible David stepped to the door and bowed again solemnly
Your excellency knows me to be kings man he said huskily but would like to say sir that if it comes to pass that must give up my life shall die with no feeling of bitterness toward the commander of the army for which my good friend gave his life am grateful to you for that assur ance sir returned Washington little hoarsely
It is my prayer Mr Treves that the Lord of Mercies will deal gently with you David opened the door and passed out quietly but with heart full of high emo tion
The soldierguardian grasped his arm and led him rapidly back to the barn and into his cell
PLAYING THE MAN
The sunlight had now quite departed and dusk was gathering but the place was in some was less gruesome less grim in its squalor than it had been before
CHAPTER XVI
MONDAY NIGHT
FRIDAY came three days after the sit ting of the court martial without further incident beyond the dull routine of the improvised prison
Late in the morning David heard coach rumble into the yard and an hour later the guard opened the door of the cell and Jessica Winnington and her father came in
David uttered great cry and clasped the girl in his arms and she sobbed con vulsively with her head on his breast while Nathaniel Winnington choked and strove manfully to find his voice
Verily David said the old man huskily at last we never thought to see our land under such reign of terror David shook his head vaguely but could not speak
He caressed the soft golden hair of his betrothed and held her close to him
Oh David she cried at last
We must save you my dear
We shall save you
This this General Washington as he calls himself sent message to us through the lines by the gracious cour tesy of Sir Henry Clinton and we were permitted to come here to plead for you
have been on my knees to the man
have told him in this last hour how noble you are how brave and hon orable yet he knows not even now if he may release you
The monster He was kindly and courteous ob served the temperate Mr Winnington
Though he condemns me himself said David shall still believe him gallant gentleman Would you both drive me mad wailed Jessica
The mans not gallant
If he were hed not doubt ladys word and youd now be in the coach with us going home again David Poor Adrian exclaimed David ab ruptly
You have heard Ah yes she cried breaking forth in sobs again its but one wo upon an other
It is the way of war remarked the old man
mourn our poor friend and deplore his unfortunate misguided course David we may remain with you but an hour sobbed the girl
Will you pass the time in talking of mens politics
We shall not be permitted to see you again but tonight we go to Sir William Howes headquarters in the city
He shall save you
He shall tell this Gen eral Washington what it means to to torture one of the kings loyal subjects
This is not the Spanish Inquisition My dearest exclaimed David beg of you do not go to Sir William Howe
It seems that hes not in po sition at present to dictate to his enemy and youll surely compromise yourselves and our good friends the Murrays
If it were known that you so much as sheltered rebel officer thereby aiding him to escape through the lines your estates might be confiscated you might even be thrown into prison
Mr Winnington you have too much discre tion to permit such folly Father will do as say declared Jessica firmly
Shall lady sacrifice her future husband merely to save con fusion to save paltry house and garden Leave it in my hands my lad said Winnington
Poor Jessica is quite be side herself and no wonder
believe that Mr Murray will accompany me to call upon Sir William and we shall speak to him discreetly
We may say that you strolled through the lines in the indul gence of whim
Sir William is genial gentleman and Im sure he will make representations to this Mr Washington and possibly arrange to exchange you for some rebel prisoner now held within our lines They talked on until the end of the THE ARGOSY
hour and the sentinel at the door then asked the visitors to withdraw
But he was forced to repeat the request three times
Jessica screamed in awful an guish at the first summons and at the last she swooned in her lovers arms and was borne from the cell by her father and the soldier
Thus David was left to an afternoon and night of black gloom and poignant grief
His hopes of the last three days were shattered
Washington had sent for the only available witnesses and it was evident that their testimony had not greatly affected his judgment
On Sunday afternoon there came to the cell dashing young aidedecamp very smart in the elaborate uniform of staff officer
David was reclining upon his blanket and the visitor sat down on the keg
am Captain Alexander Hamilton Mr Treves he announced in kindly tone and am come to offer you the sincere compliments of his excellency General Washington and his deepest sympathy and regret understand sir responded David quietly but the words came forth with great sigh
Will you do me the honor Captain Hamilton to tender my compli ments to his excellency and say to him that do not cease to thank him for his gracious kindliness to me
am hardly resigned to my fate but accept it as one of the unfortufiate incidents of war Hamilton leaned forward and placed hand gently on the prisoners shoulder
Faith sir he exclaimed was told that you were right good fellow and believe it now
But come Mr Treves he added al most jocularly youre not far from my own age and we youngsters dont give up so readily
Its my unpleasant duty to well almost to give you death warrant as it were but worse men than you sir have escaped from under the very noose
War has made you and me enemies and promise you Id be the first to shoot if saw you attempting to flee but Oh well prisoners have es caped from the most vigilant of captors
See sir youll have me quite maudlin in my talk if you keep that long face cant keep it for long in such genial company sir declared David forcing sorry smile
Pray dont think that Id make light of your trouble Hamilton added hastily
have brought you at his excellencys request Bible and sundry writing ma terials
If you require other articles for your comfort or convenience they will be furnished and on leaving shall or der for you table and chair as well as comfortable cot
believe his excel lency does not know that your prison is so ill furnished The sprightly aidedecamp already known as one of Washingtons favorites prolonged his visit to an hour and Da vid found himself chatting almost lightly with him at the end
The call had blighted his last lingering hopes but the virile spirit of the visitor strengthened him in fortitude and pre pared him in way for the imminent ordeal
Monday the last day was warm and sultry for late September and the heat in the cell was stifling as the prisoner spread his writing materials on the small table and prepared for his final melan choly duties
sentinel was now sta tioned directly outside the door the deathwatch and David could hear him panting and cursing the oppressive weather
When the guard was relieved at ten oclock the new sentinel opened the door
Look ye prisoner he called out
Ive orders to open the door and give ye air to breathe but yere not to come near it an Im here to see that ye dont
Yell have it no hotter nor this me lad wherever ye find yerself tomor row David winced at the brutal jest but held his peace and sat himself down to his task
For Jessica he filled score of pages PLAYING THE MAN
with love and heartrending messages of farewell
He bade her seek happiness in the world as soon as the first shock of parting was over and cherish him only as tender memory of early life
Death he declared was nothing to him but the killing pain of parting from his love
He wrote affectionate messages to the Murrays and to Mr and Mrs Winning ton and rather ceremonious cousinly note to Godfrey and Caroline Treves
The letters were finished in the after noon and he sealed them with wax and left them on the table
The officer of the guard offered him the attendance of clergyman but he asked to be left alone to his own prepara tions until an hour before the dawn
It was very quiet now around the barns and the headquarters
The rebel army had been spread out over the coun try to the north to fortify the banks of the Hudson and prepare for possible win ter quarters at the upper end of the island
Mounted orderlies arrived and departed at intervals but there was no more passing of wagon trains or
march ing of troops
As the sun went down gradually fad ing from the tiny window David covered his eyes with his hands that he might not see the last ray disappear
When darkness came he shook off his spell of gloom lighted his candle and fell to reading in the Bible
He was counting the galloping hours now and his most stunning shock came with midnight the beginning of his last day
He heard the sentinels along the scattered posts cry the hour in turn each one adding the familiar Alls well and he bowed his head on the table and groaned
It was the way of the world he was to die at sunrise to leave life and love and the happiness of living yet the rest of the world was crying Alls well Directly afterward the guard was changed for the next three hours and the broad back of new sentinel blocked the
still open door
Another hour sped on flying feet and just after one oclock tall fiercemus tached sergeant of the guard with clank ing saber and bayoneted musket came through the barn and spoke to the sen tinel gruffly
Theres not men enough here to fur nish ordlies he grumbled half the guards on outpost duty tonight
Look you
Youre to run with this despatch to Genral Putnams headquarters and be sharp about it
It ll take you an hour an its my job to take your place here till youre back The sentinel seemed glad of the chance to go into the open air
He took the des patch and was off directly at dogtrot and the tall sergeant blocked the door way in his place
David feared that he would assume by superior authority solicitous and talk ative attitude but he cast no more than sympathetic glance within and within five minutes he yawned and leaned his great bulk against the doorframe while he fanned himself with his cocked hat
The prisoner applied himself devotedly to the Bible and read steadily with no thought of sleep until strange noise brought him up with start
The noise was repeated and it was sterterous hearty snore
David leaned forward vaguely agitated and peered over the flickering candle to the door
The sergeant was propped like dum my against the side of the opening his head was supported by the muzzle of his musket and his breast and he was snooz ing like man utterly free from care and responsibility
Instantly like flash of inspiration came back the words of the debonair Captain Hamilton Worse men than you sir have escaped from under the very noose from the most vigilant of captors And here was of all things the least vigilant of captors
David stood for moment poised on his toes breathing hard with excitement
But the opportunity was too rare too THE ARGOSY
Godgiven to be trifled with and he waited not another second
bullet from one of the sentinels outside might end him but it would be happy end compared to that which was impending
He caught up his blanket and wrapped it like cloak about him to cover his telltale skirted coat and his knee buckles then he crept forward never breathing and slipped with infinite cau tion through the narrow space between the sergeants big body and the opposite side of the doorframe
The sergeant snored like peacefully slumbering ogre
Poor fellow thought David
This work may cost him Tiis life but its war
War He stood free in the broad passage way and saw the blackness of the still autumn night beyond the great barn dopr
Three noiseless strides and he was in the open air
He almost cried out in his wild joy
lantern burned on the porch of the mansion but it was the only liglit to be seen
Southward was the only way that offered sure liberty and he went boldly forward toward the main gate but recon noitered as he approached it
The light on the porch threw feeble rays just beyond the gate and they showed him slim rather statuesque sen tinel leaning against tree at the road side swinging his musket idly in his left hand
The man was faced straight away from the gate and for full minute he did not once turn his head
It was another chance thrust upon the fugitive by beneficent and smiling fate
On quivering toes he went forward
He glided around the gatepost at the left within six feet of the statuesque watchman slipped swiftly into the shad ow beyond and then darted clown grassy declivity ran cautiously more freely leaped out with glad bound and flew down the slope toward the Harlem River and the neutral valley
voice on the heights brought him to breathless halt
He listened for cry of alarm but distant sentinel called out Two the clock
clear morn ing and alls well Oh God in Heaven thank Thee cried David stretching his arms to the pale stars
Alls well
Alls well CHAPTER XVII
THE STERN SENSE OF DUTY
IN the afternoon of
Monday the of September David emerged from the small farmhouse of Dutch set tler on the eastern bank of the Harlem changed in appearance as though by the spells of magician of the Orient
His weeks growth of beard was shaved lightly in patches to give it ragged uncouth appearance his eyebrows were trimmed to new angle and his dark hair free from powder was allowed to straggle over his ears and forehead
He was dressed in rough suit of but ternut homespun with coarse woolen hose and clumsy woodensoled shoes
On his head flapped soft wide peasants hat and the heavy pack of pedler rounded his shoulders till he looked shorter in stature by three inches
He had pulled across the river in skiff just before dawn and with the money left in his pockets by his recent captors had won the heart of the Dutch farmer and purchased the clothes and pedlers outfit
The farmer in winter was wont to take to the road to sell small wares and had the pack ready filled
As final service the Dutchman rowed him back to the west bank of the river and David swore him to secrecy for the tenth time and went plodding down the river road toward the city
Near nightfall he halted at small roadside tavern frequented by farmers and boatmen unslung his pack and sat down in the general room to supper of porridge and hard bread
What news from the city brother he said to countryman on the opposite side of the table
PLAYING THE MAN
Why the fires out they tell me was the astonishing answer but tis told theres woful little the town left standing
News indeed spluttered David affecting looseness of speech
Im from Westchester an Ive heard of no fire Save us exclaimed the rustic
Then ye dont know that the city took fire on Saturday an burnt Trinity meet inghouse and thousand houses round about David concealed his dismay with diffi culty
Yere the first to give me such news brother he replied
Well well might fare ill there with my pack then
Haply Id do better to pay visit to the rebel camp
Do ye know aught of mat ters thereabouts Me an my lad drove wagon of cabbage there but this morning an swered the rustic but we been ill paid
The orfcers were in bad humor for some great prisoner had beat the hang man by fleeing away in the night an twas sore matter with em Now now exclaimed the listener
How came that about think ye Why twas right strange mystery was the willing answer
They do say theres somewhat much amiss in the camp
sergeant tall as sentrybox sent the prisoners guard running off with message an took the watch imself
The guard came back betimes but the prisoner was flown an so likewise was the tall sergeant
Then sir twas learnt that no such tall sergeant of the guards description was known to the army an the message that was carried by the guard proved no message at all
Twas sorry hoax an the orfcers are biting their nails an cursing the underlings for knaves an fools David laughed boisterously at the re cital but finished his meal presently and took to the road again
As he trudged along the dark and dusty way his brain was in whirl
Some one had saved his life
Who was the tall sergeant and by whom was he sent
And again who was the slen der statuesque sentinel at the gate who kept his head averted while the fugitive made good his escape
He pictured again that slim watchman who must have heard the rustle of his footsteps unless he were deaf and must have seen the darting shadow but for sudden blindness
And as he puzzled another picture shaped itself in his mind
He gasped at sudden thought
Could two men be formed as nearly alike as that slim sentinel and Captain Alexander Hamilton
All at once he stopped short and clapped his hand to his forehead
Great Jove he cried aloud
Could such thing be
The sergeant was as tall as as am
as his red face real
Did that mustache grow naturally from the lip
And was he asleep
By the high gods he cried in fresh amazement that tall sergeant was no other living man than His teeth came together with snap
He was the man who saved my poor life he finished humbly and my true friend forever For another minute he stood still in the dark road then he strode on with heart throbbing with gladness and deep emotion
The dusty miles rolled away beneath his feet he came to the Boston road and swung into it with joy and be fore he realized the distance he had cov ered the great house of Incleberg loomed before him
It was late but that house was his des tination
He stepped upon the porch and tapped softly at the door
man ser vant opened it fearfully peered out then ordered him savagely away
happy inspiration suggested to Da vid the old nickname that Mrs Murray had applied to him
Go tell your mistress Mrs Murray he said that pedler named Petruchio would have speech with her The servant closed the door and THE ARGOSY
David wondered if it would open again
minute passed and then the welcome face of the lady df the mansion looked out upon him
she exclaimed wonder ingly as she gazed at the uncouth figure of the pedler
Its Petruchio that is the tamed one this time dear lady whispered David and Mrs Murray uttered cry that rang through all the house and caught him in wild embrace
David Treves is alive she screamed
Alive and here There was rush from the inner rooms and Robert Murray and Mr Win nington dragged the pedler into the draw ingroom with frantic joy
Jessica exclaimed the masquerader inquiringly
Ill unto death with breaking heart sobbed Mrs Murray but the healing will be speedy David Then Jessica was aroused from the deathlike trance into which she had lain since the previous day and brought to the drawingroom in her fathers arms attended by her sorrowing mother
Slowly they explained to her that the grimy pedler was her lover miraculously restored
She listened dumbly for while with pathetic listlessness then her keen eyes penetrated the disguise and torrent of tears broke the killing ten sion and restored her to life and happi ness
No one slept until David had told his story but he left the mystery of the two mysterious guards for
his listeners to solve in their own way
Next day he heard with wonder and consternation the full details of the fire that had broken out on Saturday and reduced the city in many parts to ruin
The treacherous rebel sympathizers were blamed for it Mr Murray asserted and some of them had been put to death al ready by the royal troops
But my cousins Godfrey and Caro line exclaimed David
Truly my friends am ashamed of my thoughtless ness but have not thought to ask you where they are and how they fare Never fear David said Mrs Mur ray you may trust Mrs Caroline to protect her husband and herself
They are once more in possession of your house in Wall Street and in the course of events they have become professed and accredited Royalists and Tories You may well believe that am amazed said David but of course am highly pleased
am glad that my house is no longer divided against itself
What of our residence
You say that they are there Your house was providentially spared by the fire answered Mr Murray and believe that your cousins were keeping it
in order for you when they heard the crushing news of your impending fate
Now they will be overjoyedto know that you are safe Later in the day David wrote cor dial letter to Godfrey Treves announcing his safe return and congratulating his cousifl upon his conversion to the ranks of the Royalists
He sent it into the city by his faithful valet and on the fol lowing day letter arrived from Godfrey with postscript added by Caroline Indeed David you must yield to God freys urging and visit us at once
You will find your house in order dear cousin and we shall welcome you with great joy
You may feel assured that we do not regret our new allegiance and it will be rare pleasure to gather about the old table and pledge family toast to his majesty the king
Yr affnte cousin Caroline
David waited another day loath to leave Jessica even for few hours then he drove into the halfruined city in postchaise to call at the Wall Street mansion and spend an afternoon with his relatives
Trinity Church was wellnigh razed to the ground and some three hundred houses were leveled
It was tragic dispiriting sight and he was glad to gain DAVE CRASSONS BRONCO
the shelter of his own roof and find it sound and much as he had left it
The welcome accorded him was hearty it seemed to him just trifle too hearty
He checked himself in wonder ing if Godfrey and Caroline would have mourned him sincerely
They were am bitious people and in addition to the mansion they would have received his money from the British funds after his death
He banished such thoughts in mo ment and sat down gaily to repast such as Caroline was proud to provide
They toasted the king with real enthu siasm and then David at their request began recital of his strange experiences
He was interrupted presently however by the arrival of visitors but Godfrey or dered the butler to bring them directly to the diningroom and requested David to proceed
There was shuffling of feet in the hall and David turned to see Captain Goring standing on the threshold while at his back were three fully armed grena diers
Caroline uttered soft cry and fled suddenly through side door
Captain Goring said Godfrey with strange sharpness in his voice this is your man What gasped David starting back
Why David Treves snapped the British captain arrest you in the kings name for treason to the royal govern ment for consorting with notorious reb els and for lending aid to the rebel cause Who dares to fasten such accusa tions upon me cried David livid with rage
As loyal subject said Godfrey with virtuous gravity of countenance was forced most unwillingly to report your duplicity to the military governor
have done my duty To Be Continued
rasson cf Paul Bailey AVE CRASSON left Waverly on the afternoon freight
The train didnt stop
It didnt even hesitate
But Dave Crasson wasnt the sort of individual to let little thing like that interfere with his very necessary de parture
He just raced his pinto along the station platform and grabbing the side of car swung aboard
Our posse arrived in time to take in the performance and we fired one volley
Then seeing that Crasson was out of THE ARGOSY
range and still traveling eastward we surrounded his bronc
Well sir it was the first time any of us had ever had the opportunity of studying Steamboat at close range
So we roped him from four different angles and then looked him over
And he returned our scrutiny with such utter unconcern that we all found it mighty hard to believe that this was really Steamboat the fastest long windest meanest piece of horseflesh in seven States
And would you believe it Sheriff Hazen wished that critter on the Bar Maybe it was because we happened to be the nearest outfit to Waverly maybe because the foreman yours truly was an easy mark
Anyhow Steamboat was given durable little corral all to himself and became our star boarder
For three days we didnt do thing on the place but greet visitors who thought they could ride the critter
For three nights we did nothing but sit up with the victims
The day Sam Bransford the worlds champion bronco buster took his turn the Bar would have made the Denver Round Up look like game of huck chuck
Folks came from miles around
And when we led Steamboat out of his corral they yelled like pack of Comanches
The pinto was on his metal
Somehow he seemed to know that it was to be decisive battle and it was all we could do to get both girths cinched up
Then we let Bransford ride
That is the biggest part of the audience was will ing and anxious enough that he should ride but the darned horse just stood up on his hind legs and started rocking like steamboat
Wed heard of that trick of his
Thats how hed got his name
But wed never seen it before
Backjumping rainbowing and sjunfish ing had proved effective enough to unseat all previous candidates
Now however Steamboat was doing his darnedest
After hed rocked Bransfords left lung over to the far side of his right he just naturally brought down his forelegs stiff ducked his head and the matinee was over
That settled it
Steamboat had made good and we all went back to the even tenor of punching cows for old man Elihu Martin
Elihu had daughter Miss Kate and along about this time she came home from the East where she had been ex changing some of the old mans beef dividends for roll of sheepskin
Dave Harkness the new man drove her in from the depot at Waverly and they ar rived just as our Jarge and appreciative audience was hitting the trail for home
Of course Harkness had to tell her all fibout it and Harkness was some teller
Having been with the Bar but two days he wasnt quite up on all the de tails but he told Miss Kate enough about Dave Crasson the outlaw and his won derful horse to fill dime novel
He even took Crasson picture from the bunkhouse and showed her the living likeness of the blackbearded roadagent
Then he led her to the durable little corral and introduced her to Steamboat
happened along at that moment
Isnt he beauty she says to me and choked when nodded
Id grown to despise that calicocovered dynamo and it was hard to acknowledge his good looks
But hes maverick told her hating to see her lose her innocent young heart to such critter
Dave Crassons the only man who ever rode him Surely you dont believe that she says pushing handful of grass over the pickets
Well butts in Harkness he didnt until hed tried the critter himself Then we both gasped
Relieve it or not that long lanky bronco with the wicked rep whinnied like hungry colt and trotted right up to her
Why says Miss Kate as he took the grass out of her hand think you boys have been libeling him And as she spoke she reached over and DAVE CRASSONS BRONCO
rubbed Steamboats muzzle
And he liked it
Yes sir
The sonofagun liked it
If he hadnt kept one mean eye on me Id have thought it was another horse
Inside of twentyfour hours Steamboat and Miss Kate were pals
Before the week was up they were bosom com panions and if it hadnt been for the old man who had dealt with horses for some thirty years shed have tried to ride him
But Miss Kate and Steamboat didnt furnish the only affair for discussion around the Bar that summer
It wasnt more than week before all hands were talking about the way young Harkness was getting better acquainted with the old mans sole heir
If Hark ness hadnt been such darned likable cuss it might have caused more than little talk for the boys all looked upon Miss Kate as the one bright star in firmament of alkali hard work bacon and eggs
Sometimes wondered why the old man never seemed to notice the way those two young souls looked at each other as they talked in low tones which nobody else could hear
But it wasnt my fu neral
wasnt her old man
Besides the job of foreman on the Bar didnt allow much time to devote to other folks affairs
decided to keep mum
But decisions dont count when Fate steps in
It happened like this
was at Waverly doing some shopping for the old man when suddenly looked up and started
Tacked to the side of Pete Spragues liquor emporium was picture of Jake Harkness
The wind or something had got away with the lower half of it but it was Harkness all right
From the nose up the only part left was Jim Harkness
And across the top of that poster was printed Five thousand dollars reward Well sir stood and looked at that picture openmouthed for ten minutes until finally stranger came along touched me on the shoulder and says Do you know him Know him says
Sure who is it The stranger grinned
Huh he says
You must be newcomer to these parts
Everybody knows that face
Only the black whis kers have been torn off
Thats Dave Crasson Oh says and went inside
But it got me thinking
Id seen Crasson picture all over the country for the past six months
But Id never before seen it without the whiskers
When got back to the Bar called Jake Harkness aside
We stood right by Steamboats corral
Jake says how long since you shaved your whiskers off Well sir told myself then and there if Jake Harkness was Dave Crasson they were both darn good actors
He just simply grinned and says Whiskers
never had any Pete Oh yes you did says
And you shaved em off between the time Dave Crasson hopped the freight at Waverly and Jake Harkness got job on the Bar Im wise Jake
Own up Laugh
You could have heard him half way to the railroad but he stopped as quick as hed begun
Miss Kate stepped in between us
Shed heard it all and her eyes were flashing mighty prettily
She bent them right on Dave and she looked him through and through
But though hed stopped laughing at her first appearance he was complete master of himself
He was more surprised than anything else
And he waited for her to speak
Jake she said heard what Pete said to you
What does he mean dont know said Jake and fig ured that Id been bit hasty
She turned to me
What did you mean she asked her eyes still flashing
Well said judging that might as well own up and then apologize saw picture of Dave Crasson today over at Waverly
All that was left of THE ARGOSY
it was from the nose up and Miss Kate believe it or not it was the image of Jake here
So when got home just made up my mind to ask him if by any chance he happened to be next of kin or otherwise related to the road agent You mean corrected Miss Kate that you thought Jake might be Dave Crasson himself Her question made it easier
Again she turned to Jake studied him several minutes and asked Are you Dave Crasson He was serious now
An accusation like mine was enough to make any one serious
He returned her gaze without flicker as he said Miss Kate my names Jake Hark ness
never saw Dave Crasson and if lucks with mrf never will
Do you believe me She studied him again before commit ting herself
Then she nodded
Yes Jake she said
do Then to me Pete it was horrid of you to think such an awful thing of him know it answered and Im awfully sorry stuck out my hand Jake grabbed it and the incident was closed without blood shed
But somehow or other couldnt get that picture of Dave Crasson out of my head
Id lay awake nights thinking of it and at times Id almost make up my mind to talk it over with the old man
But never did
Jake Harkness proved to be too much of an asset to the Bar Before the summer was over he had be come an absolute necessity to the outfit and when told the old man as much he said hed known it himself for some weeks
So things drifted along
Miss Kate and Harkness became thicker and thick er and before cold weather set in it was generally understood around the Bar that Jake was about to tak unto himself wife and Old Man Martin sonin law
And the boys were tickled to death
Harkness was popular cuss
Yes sir even who still entertained sneaking notion that he had some sort of past that wasnt in his family Bible was look ing forward to that wedding
Then things occurred
First Ken tucky thoroughbred arrived as sort of preliminary wedding gift from the old man to the blushing bride
And he was some horse
He went over the trail like German torpedo and ought to know
tried him out
And after Id pronounced him safe and sane Jake Harkness hopped astride
Id never seen Jake on spirited horse before
He was stickler for easygaited mounts the kind that dont go in for the fancy steps
But Hercules how he did ride that thoroughbred
Say there wasnt man on the place that didnt wonder how hed kept his ac complishments under cover and Miss Kate laughed in sheer pride
As for me my mind reverted to that torn picture of Dave Crasson and looked over toward Steamboats corral
It gave me an idea
Jake said after hed circled the house couple of times and then hopped down youre the only man hereabouts outside the boss thats never had try at Steamboat
Im thinking you could make the critter go some Sam Bransford couldnt he says easy like as he helped Miss Kate to mount her preliminary wedding gift
She looked down at him and smiled
Maybe she had thoughts something like mine
Maybe she was thinking of the story about no man but Dave Crasson ever riding Steamboat
Anyhow she said Why dont you try him Jake What could he do
The boys had the dynamo under saddle and out in the open before you could say Daniel Boone
And Jake looking as if he was about to enter the electric chair stepped forward
Well some
Harkness started it with an Indian yell and savage slap on the flank
Up went the pinto and DAVE CRASSONS BRONCO
when hed risen to the full extent of his long hind legs he commenced rocking
It was gruesomefor we could see Jake Harkness slowly succumbing to the tor ture
Then down headforemost went Steamboat aild headforemost went Hark ness to the turf
tell you was relieved
It didnt look like acting
glanced at Miss Kate and she was relieved too
Every ounce of suspicion went out of us then and there
And in her happiness Miss Kate just slapped that thoroughbred across the neck and he bolted
Off went her hat one stirrup flew wild and the brute was running away
Miss Kate didnt yell
She wasnt that kind of girl
She stuck to the little English saddle and die pulled on those reins with all her strength
But it wasnt enough
The horse had the bit between his teeth and he was boss
Yes sir and there wasnt another horse under saddle on the whole place that is none except Steamboat
And guess he was the only one that could have caught the thoroughbred anyway
However some of the boys beat it for the corral
They had to do something
And might have gone too
But as swung around saw something that turned my blood cold and let me say right here and now that was darned glad to see it
Jake Harkness had leaped toward Steamboat
Snatching up the dangling reins he went clean to the saddle with out so much as touching the stirrups
And Steamboat
He just stood rigid until Jake had whispered something in his ear
Then pivoting he went after that runaway like bolt of Texas lightning
And it sure was exquisite
half mile up the trail went cloud of dust which was Miss Kate and her preliminary wed ding gift
And when Steamboat got under full headway that cloud of dust didnt seem to be doing much more than just moving
Harkness must have put in some slick io Argosy work for when the action ceased and the dust drifted clear he had that thor oughbred on one side of him and Miss Kate on the other his arm about her and Steamboat was trotting back toward us as meek as my old Bess
Harkness was Crasson all right
There wasnt man on the place who didnt know it
But say you ought to have seen the boys grab his hands when he got down after handing Miss Kate to me
And you ought to have seen Miss Kate look at him when shed finally got over the scare
When she spoke we all lis tened
Jake she said why did you lie to Pete and me that day by the corral Because loved you he said and he seemed awful stuck up about it
You see turning to me Id de cided to go straight when hopped the freight at Waverly
But later wanted to be near Steamboat
He was the only friend Id ever had
planned to get away with him and go East
Then met Miss Kate
couldnt leave
But guess its all over now
If some of you will come along Ill just jog over and give myself up to Sheriff Hazen No you wont neither said before realized that it wasnt up to me to pro nounce the sentence
noticed that the boys all nodded and Miss Kate grabbed Jakes right hand and said Of course you wont
Your real name Jake is going to remain secret with everybody on the Bar You cant go unless you take me Well sir Jake Harkness is my boss now
The old man just sits around and smokes his pipe and plays with the two little Harknesses
And when Jake goes into Waverly on Steamboat folks look at him and say Harkness and Dave Crasson are the only men who ever rode that pinto And if any of us happen to be trailing along we grin and think pf the day Steam boat made that preliminary wedding gift look like crippled coyote
HAT are we coming to The youth held his three companions enthralled by what he had been saying and the fire that flared in his eyes
Where are we going to end he continued
Food riots have commenced
The mob begins to rule
Next bomb play will be intro duced and death He threw out his hands in prophetic gesture
Thats the result fellows he went on growing more voluble in his wildness
Why look here
Do you know that the investigation which the Federal govern ment has been conducting into the high food prices has resulted in the verdict that the prices are occasioned by speculators food manipulators and that the condi tions are facilitated by general car shortage and all that
And then the commission adjourns without recommend ing single remedy
tell you boys well never get satis faction in this country well never rid ourselves of high prices and speculators until we take drastic measures
Hang few of these millionaires who corner the food market and shake millions into their coffers He paused minute and glanced through the Pullman
Karby seated three chairs behind the fellow met his wild eyes with an even but interested stare
It was apparent that Karby had at first been amused then infected by the youths ardor and enthusiasm
maga zine lay face upward across Karby knees but it had gone unread for some moments
pretty girl in the chair diagonally opposite had also lowered book and listened
Her face had changed color slightly at the wild suggestion of capital punishment for food speculators Karby fleeting glance caught the expression and he vaguely wondered at it as he prepared to hear what further the youth had to ex pound
It was very evident that his stronger arguments were about to burst forth
He cleared his throat straightened to more commanding attitude and stretched forth FIGHTING THE EGG KING
his long arms as though preparing for emphatic gesticulation
Theres our own town for example
Potatoes selling for threefifty bushel thats at the rate of about three cents apiece
Think of it more than we paid for lemons two years ago
And that isnt all
Mr Grimes our butter man told us the other day that he has five hundred bushels of potatoes in his cellars and that he has been paid big price by some agent who came along two weeks ago not to sell these potatoes for at least three months
These agents have gone all over the country making similar overtures to farmers in order to keep low the potato supply and thus permit prices to be boosted He took another breathing spell swal lowed and plunged into his subject again
Theres Truxton in our own town Cassius Stanley Truxton who says bold ly that hes going to clean up million dollars in eggs
He doesnt make any bones about it puts his fingers through his vest and comes right out with the in formation that he has two hundred thou sand gross of eggs in cold storage gross not dozens and that hes going to hold them until the price soars and then hell sell and what he asks insolently is the public going to do about it
Do about it
Nothing of course
What can the public do about it when the government permits such proceedings
And hes only one of the many specu lators who has corhered eggs all over the United States
Theres sugar he exploded going off on another tack
For year the specu lators have been trying to comer the sugar market and have at last succeeded
Sugar sells at twenty cents pound in some of our larger cities and the supply is so low that many houses cant get bit of it
Fine state of affairs for peaceful nation country that isnt at actual war with anybody prices higher than they are in Germany in England
Do you know what theyre paying right now for potatoes in Toronto and they think the price exorbitant
Sixtyfive cents bushel
Thats fact have cousin living in Toronto who wrote that to me
Now do not believe in mob rule and anarchy he went on in quieter tones as though he realized he had broached ticklish subject
But what are the peo ple to do when the government that rules them sits back and discusses the situation in cabinet meetings and then suggests an appropriation of four hundred thousand dollars for thorough investigation which they propose to extend over period of six months
Six months when the food crisis is on us now
Six months when the people in our large city slums are starving
Six months when anarchy threatens now
Might as well operate on man after he is dead as to say they will deal with this situation in six months
Do you fellows know what it is to starve to feel the pinch of hunger gnaw ing at your stomachs
had touch of it once was lost three days on hunting trip in northern Canada
tell you hun ger will make people do anything
No six months investigations will not help
What we want is action drastic action now now He shouted the final now till the car rang with the noise
There fell silence
After his burst of oratory the silence hung like the hush which follows the boom of great gun
Karby stared re flectively at this young firebrand
He had spoken fanaticism yes
But there was great thought behind his words prophetic warning review of the situa tion which was startling
Karby glanced at the girl diagonally opposite
Her cheeks were red with the flush that had bespread them some time ago and her eyes like his stared with studied expression as though her mind might be rehearsing the better points the young fellow had made
What suggestions would you offer one of his companions now asked the speaker
BOO THE ARGOSY
would suggest drastic action at once by the government
But do you know what would do if was one of these peculiar millionaires who had so much money he didnt know what to do with it and yet who couldnt get any pleasure any enjoyment out of life
We read about these fellows occasionally in the yellow journals
Heres the case for instance of multimillionaire who kills himself because he couldnt get any thing out of life who had been melan choly for months
There are lots of these men
Well if was one of them Id get some excitement some enjoyment out of this very situation
Do you know what Id do
Well Ill tell you
Id take town like our own for example where the food prices are high where there resides an egg king like our friend Truxton
Id go into that town and secretly Id rent hall place like the old fair building on South Street for example
Then Id hire an army of men to work for me and Id stock that place with everything in the food line could get hold of
Id spend millions send men out through the country to buy up potatoes eggs vegetables canned goods preserves everything in the eating line and then one day Id throw my place open after had such supply that they couldnt buy me out in month and Id slash prices Id practically give the goods away
And eggs
Id sell them for fifteen twenty cents dozen and put this man Truxton out of business
It wouldnt benefit the country at large one whit but by George Id be one millionaire whod be getting some enjoyment and excite ment out of life
Why Id have thou sand speculators at me threatening bribing coaxing
Thats what Id do
Its an idle dream vision but Id do it if had millions of money at my con trol
And then Truxton could rot with the eggs hes piled up Karby was leaning forward as if at play of intense dramatic situations
He stared at this orator as though he had been Luther
Karbys calm gray eyes were now fired and spit forth glints like bits of chipped steel
His hands were trembling
There was perspiration oozing over his broad high forehead
For second he glanced toward the pretty girl feeling sort of companion ship for her from the fact that he and she were in reality the immediate audi ence
The girls face was crimson and she was prey to confusion
Karby stared at her fascinated by the guilt which seemed to shine in her features
She swept her eyes up
Karby caught his breath with jerk
They were deep eyes pretty wide set and the blue in them now seemed gray now blue now gray again
They were eyes which Karby knew he would remember long after he had forgotten the accompanying details of her face eyes which he might awaken at night to see staring at him out of the vistas of his memory
For second Karby forgot the oratory and the subject that had so stirred him and lost himself in staring at the girl
Coming to at last he turned away his glance
At that minute the porter bustled into the car and began his obsequious and re munerative task of wielding the whisk broom
At the next station the orator and his three friends prepared to alight and their conversation told Karby that this was their home town
Without more ado he followed them from the train hailed cab and directed to be driven to the best hotel
Karby had found way of buying himself such an interest in life as he had never possessed
As his cab swung out of the station he saw the pretty girl who had sat diagonally opposite him being handed into wonderful motorcar by chauffeur who was the last word in adorn ment as far as livery was concerned and in the rear of the car striking looking FIGHTING THE EGG KING
man tall and broad and rather gray made room for her beside him
One month later the old fair building on South Street was the scene of wonder ful activity
It was gigantic frame structure which covered one square block of ground
Time had weathereaten its paint and its ornate embellishments but its hugeness was still intact it yet loomed up big and Titanic on dark night picture of desolation reminder of days when the whole county dispensed with business for the greater part of week and journeyed here in droves to witness an exhibition which to them was the epitome of expositions
It was ten years since the place had responded to the call of human patronage and dust and swallows and sparrows bats owls spiders and pigeons had usurped the ihterior and by right of con quest claimed it as their own
But now the great double doors in each of the four streets were standing wide open teams were driving in and out veritable thousand men were scurrying over the place like rats
The interior reverberated with the sound of banging hammer and sledge
Joists came down and new and stronger ones replaced them
Men ran hither and thither with blueprints and folding rules
Superintending the work of construc tion consulting with foremen and bosses was Nathan Karby
He was ubiquitous now on the inside of the building now on the out directing the laying of rail road siding to his unloading platfqfm
His aims seemed to be speed unity of action concentration of work to one end in view
glance told the most casual that his word was law that neither blueprint nor plan verbal nor written contract mattered whit
What he said went
As one day followed another and this army of workmen continued their labor order began to emanate from the chaos of beams lumber stone brick tiling
Six great long aisles which ran the whole length of the building paralleled each other like six great streets of city These aisles were very wide and soor they were equipped with counters bins glass cases shelves cupboards drawers In his quarters at the Jefferson Hotel Karby had set up an improvised office and here behind flat top desk he inter viewed agents sellers farmers grange officials salesmen
At the same time he recruited an army of workers whom he sent out through the country into neigh boring cities and villages
These agents spread over the land like the tentacles of an octopus and they went equipped with cash and bought and bought and bought
Karby was elated
He was purchasing his interest in life
His gray eyes shone
He caught his breath and thrust out his firm jaw and smacked his thin lips when he anticipated the scenes in which he would soon participate
The moneyed men of the community would sweep down on him in droves
The food speculators and manipulators would haunt him like bad dream
He would welcome these scenes
He could scarcely wait for them to develop
One noon when Karby returned to the Jefferson for luncheon he noticed in the lobby myriads of young girls who were accosting the hotel guests in quest of funds for one of the city hospitals
Karby had read in the daily papers that cam paign was being inaugurated to raise hundred thousand dollars
People were tagged with yellow check as they re sponded with contributions
Karby had escaped the campaigners in the street by reason of the fact that he drove motorcar and had been off too early in the morning to be approached
But now the minute he stepped into the hotel most charming young lady picked him out as her victim and came hurrying toward him
Karby paused and found himself look ing into the same pair of beautiful eyes that he had looked into that day on the train
As his gaze met hers Karby saw that THE ARGOSY
she recognized and placed him on the instant
The slightest shade of confusion swept over her for second and brought tinge to her cheek and downward sweep of the long brown lashes
In this nearer view of her Karby was astounded that such charming creature had been displaced for single day in his memory by his absorption in his scheme
Perhaps you have read of the cam paign to raise money for an addition to one of our city hospitals she began tremulously and not without trace of confusion
Were trying not to miss any body and thought perhaps some of the guests at our hotels might want to sub scribe suppose its worthy object Karby said easily playing for time for the purpose of detaining the girl longer
Im stranger here you know Oh indeed can vouch for the worthiness of this hospital
They do need money so badly and they must have more room or dont know what they will do
We will be so grateful for any thing you may care to give She select ed tag from bundle in her hands and made ready to tie it through the lapel of his coat
should think that in these times Karby replied still angling for some scheme to detain the girl that couple of gross of good fresh eggs would be about as acceptable as anything else to hospital Karby had intended to elaborate on the remark and give it quite facetious turn but the girls actions checked him
She flushed red to the roots of her hair deep deep red her eyes went down and he saw her lips quiver
Whei her lashes went up he saw that her eyes were wet with tears of wounded pride and hurt vanity
She stared at him for just second then turned so cold that her very glance chilled him to the bone
Then she seemed to rise straighter than ever as she stood there like statue
should not have accosted you she said icily
should have known that one must expect to find your type in hotels She made as though to move past him but he touched her on the arm and de tained her
beg your pardon he said sincerely
Believe me meant no offense what ever
am so sorry
Ill admit my re mark was ill chosen to one who is stranger to me
want you to accept something for
this worthy cause
do not care to have my name men tioned or even known but if you will wait here just bit while go to the bank and draw my contribution in cash
should like to give thousand dollars
You will wait and you will assure me that you have overlooked my remark He smiled at her and his smile was nearly as contagious as her own
She murmured something in the affirmative and he was gone
When he came back he handed her sealed envelope and per mitted her to tie tag to his lapel
Was it fate or destiny or marvelous coincidence that the very next day on motoring into the country to interview some farmers engine trouble left him stranded miles from the city and she happened along in huge touringcar ordered her chauffeur to stop and render aid and his car refusing all calls to mo tion she was unconventional enough to give him lift back to town
Moreover she was affable to the extent of engaging in conversation tribute which the occasion did not necessarily de mand of her
Karby was elated
Meantime work progressed rapidly on the old fair building
Such an army of men must soon accomplish results
Karby spared no expense was thorough to detail although his natural business ability saw to it that no cash was wasted
In two weeks the building was nearing completion and the traffic manager whom Karby had imported from one of the larger railroads began delivering carload after carload of foodstuffs
FIGHTING THE EGG KING
It seemed as though the worlds produc tion of potatoes was being emptied into the building
Karbys agents penetrated the country to its depths
Motorcars had driven them into localities where the food shortage and the speculator had not set foot and they were able to buy at prices far under those demanded by wholesalers in the cities
Karby himself marveled at the miles which these provisions were covering to reach him
Without being conscious of it he had whipped together wonderful organization
And not alone potatoes came flooding into his place
Every known popular and necessary edible which mankind caters to came in superabundance
Of course the town soon began to wonder about the project
The press sent reporters in droves to interview fore men laborers superintendents con tractors but Karby himself had given no information to single soul and therefore they could divulge nothing
Rumor and idle gossip and speculation ran high
The newspapers supplied fic tion where facts were lacking and by pub lishing something which was not true tempted Karby to state his real purpose trick of the press by the way but Karby only smiled and held his peace
He meant to open his great relief store as he called it on Monday morning and the preceding Sunday he intended to carry brief but glaring ad in the papers of the town stating his list of prices and his purpose in selling at cost or below
The whole gigantic affair was to be loss to Karby from beginning to end
Financiers would have stood back appalled at the idea and had they seen his expense accounts and compared them with his intended selling prices they would have succumbed to emotion or voted Karby subject for an asylum
Karby forgot no detail
As the time approached to divulge his great scheme he employed corps of detectives and upon their advice procured the services of two hundred special deputies
His money brought certain politicians to exert their power which made the deputies possible
These deputies guarded the building day and night
It was necessary pre caution
Food manipulators were none too exacting about the means they em ployed and Karby was advised that once his scheme was out and the finer points of his great plan were discovered the rage of the speculators would soar and they might possibly stoop to force to thwart his scheme
Meantime his detectives were busy taking such steps as would prevent spec ulators agents invading the store when it did open and buying up the foodstuffs
On Friday the building was an arsenal of provisions
And it was on this Friday about four oclock that the storm broke
Karby had returned to the hotel early and was sitting at his desk framing the advertisement which he desired for the Sunday press when Mason one of his clerks entered and informed him that delegation of six men desired to see him that they would present no cards and appeared to be the gloomiest surliest group of individuals he had ever seen
Karby sent out detective to explain that he was
at present engaged and would be unable to see them
He also ordered the detective to discover if possible some thing of their identities and to refuse to book them for any interview as he didnt wish to argue his position to anybody
The detective returned sweltering
He declared he had never put in such ten minutes that the six had nearly tom him to pieces and he had only got rid of them by threatening to call for help and have them ejected forcibly from the suite
He also reported that the big man of the assemblage was Truxton the egg king and that he had with him man named Macavey his secretary and farmer whom the detective discovered was presi dent of one of the granges
Another of the men was proprietor of large whole sale house in the city and the remaining two he could find nothing about
From that moment on Karby was more THE ARGOSY
sought after than the President of the United States
double and then quadruple guard was placed before his suite and all afternoon and late into the evening men came excited men enraged men perturbed men men who pleaded threatened then pleaded again to be granted an interview
Karby turned them all down
He would see no one whose business he did not know beforehand
He was forced to dine in his rooms as precaution against annoyance and he spent the evening reading the towns pa pers
The reporters had at last hit upon something like the truth and had dis played the news in glaring headlines
This no doubt was responsible for his popularity and had set the six excited men on his heels
Speculation ran high
One sheet carried brief editorial commenting in general way on the rumor and offering neither praise nor con demnation of the plan
Karby smiled
He ordered the night guard at the store doubled and went to bed
The next morning early the interviewers started their vigil and lined up in the corridor outside his door until the place looked like the floor of the New York stock exchange
At eleven Karby ap plied to the hotel management for aid with the result that the police were called in cleared the corridors patrolled the place and kept it clear
At eleventhirty one of the policemen brought Karby card stating that very beautiful woman had sent it in and desired to see Mr Karby on matter of the utmost importance
Karby glanced at the name on the card which read simply Miss Truxton
Karby stared at the card as though fascinated
At first his calm and rather tantalizing smile puckered his lips but he sobered immediately and studied the sit uation second
So they had got delegate through at last they were resorting to woman to tell their message the egg kings daughter
Karbys sense of chivalry produced struggle within him
Ordinarily he would have been invulnerable to this means of reaching him but if woman of breed ing was willing to sacrifice her pride to the extent of coming here to see him he believed he should grant the interview
He told the policeman to admit her
Karby went to the window and stood looking out
He heard her enter heard the door close softly heard her take step into the place and then pause ap parently to collect herself
This was what Karby desired
He turned slowly and looked into the ex quisite eyes of the woman on the train die very girl who had approached him in the hotel lobby soliciting donations to Lakeside Hospital
She was dressed in tailored suit and presented that wellgroomed and well tended appearance that had so impressed him when he first saw her
She wore hat which rather shielded her face but it did not prevent his seeing the look of incredulity that swept into her features as she recognized him
As for himself Karby was not sure whether he changed color or no
He merely stared at her again prey to her exquisite eyes
It was shock the knowledge that this girl was the egg kings
daughter and even as he stood there looking at her the re alization of the situation came over him
The plan of his general relief store the slashing of prices the eggs he already had in stock which he was going to sell for song all meant ruin financial downfall for Truxton
He had known this before all along and had even counted on it but now the realization seemed to turn cold and dampen his ardor
The girl was the first to recover her self
She came forward holding out her hand and smiling frankly into his eyes
am so glad to find some one here FIGHTING THE EGG KING
that know
Ive come to see Mr Karby you will present me to him it will make things so much easier for me Great Heavens she hadnt yet awak ened to the real situation
He smiled rather wistfully shook his head slowly and said quietly Miss Truxton am Mr Karby The horror that came into her features was only compensated by their beauty
Her eyes opened Until he imagined he was looking into two wonderful worlds and she fell back one two three paces and stared at him
Karby turned slightly to give her chance to recover from the shock of his announcement
When he faced her again she was staring calmly at him her big eyes regarding him with something of awe
hadnt dreamed that you were Mr Karby although might have guessed put two and two together
You were on the train that day and heard the wild talk of that wild youth
Mr Karby she took step forward and stared hard at him it isnt true that youre going to open your store and sell at such low prices that it will ruin those who have stocked up on things hoping to sell when the price was up Karby smiled
He shook his head slowly in the affirmative and said quietly Im afraid its all true Miss Truxton
Im putting into effect the very idea which that wild youth as you call him declared he would follow if he was one of those eccentric and peculiar millionaires who couldnt get any enjoyment out of life She stared at him permitting him the fullest view of her wonderful eyes and the sweet features that went with them
Karby caught his breath
He found madness seizing upon him madness which he thrust back with an effort
You know what they call my father she went on slowly
The egg king though didnt know until now that you were his daughter
understand now why my remark that day caused you such annoyance but was not aware of your identity then She passed over the explanation as though she considered it trivial in com parison with what she had come to say
You will slash the price on eggs Mr Karby Storage eggs for twenty cents per dozen fresh ones for twentyfive and the strictest kind of fresh eggs guaranteed for thirty It means financial ruin to my father she said slowly her eyes not meeting his directly but staring at the wall as though she were speaking some speech which she had committed to mem ory
He has two hundred thousand gross of eggs in storage Listen Mr Karby my father stands ready to buy up every egg you possess for forty cents dozen if you will agree not to stock up any more Karby shook his head and smiled
No Miss Truxton cant be bought neither can the eggs have
Those eggs are for housewives who havent had the privilege of owning eggs in any quantity for months
Men who have cornered the egg market will have to suffer along with those people who cornered potatoes sugar
Your father is not the only one Miss Truxton But Mr Karby my father has done no wrong
Why people buy real estate and hold it until prices go way up and then sell
Its the legitimate way to make money
Why do you enter into this wild scheme
Youre losing millions of dollars by it Exactly Miss Truxton He paused collected himself and faced her squarely
Miss Truxton it was more than coin cidence that day which brought me listener to that wild youth with his fanatical scheme
But was one of the very men he described millionaire if you will permit me the term lor lack of better who could see nothing interesting in life
was veritable nomad on the face of the earth
That very trip was making had no definite destination in view
was just going from one place THE ARGOSY
to another seeking something that would enliven me and found it
Never in all my existence have been so keenly interested in life as now
This exploit has made me
shall never forget it
Of course shall be losing millions by the scheme but what of it
It is my own money
Moreover am not stupid enough to believe that this one relief store as call it will affect the prices of the country in general
It wont
It cant
But it satisfies me serves my purpose and some of the people will benefit by it And you would not consider selling out
your eggs to father at the price he named Most decidedly no Miss Truxton Well remember Mr Karby that came to you and made you an offer
Dont forget this
wanted to give you chance
You spumed it
Men Mr Karby dont give up easily especially when they see their fortunes slipping away as you threaten to make them slip away
Goodby Mr Karby Before he could reply she was gone
Karby stared after her rehearsing her final words and trying to ferret out their hidden meaning
Why had she come to see him
Had old Truxton really offered to buy his eggs or had she come for some other purpose
She had given him chance
Her final speech hinted at trouble seemed to insinuate threat
What did these food speculators mean to do
What scheme had her father con cocted to thwart him
And did she know that scheme
Her words sounded as though she did
That night at nine he had the answer
It came by phone and was from one of his special deputies on guard at the store
mob was collecting about the build ing mob already thousand strong mob that threatened violence had been stirred up by the news that the goods were stock which Karby had cornered and that he was going to sell at top notch prices and squeeze the people
Karby saw it all now
He jumped into his car and headed for the store
If the rabble was thousand strong when the message reached him they had doubled by the time he arrived at the outskirts of the crowd
He parked his machine and proceeded on foot
Whoever had stirred up the mob and had put the riot idea into their heads had dohe good work for the speculators
There were women in the horde wildeyed women some holding babies in their arms some leading children by the hand
It was motley throng throng of all nationalities speaking polyglot tongues
And above all came the cry of We are hungry we are hungry Alcohol had done its work
Money must have been disbursed freely
The move was hardly one of eleventh hour fomentation but held been brewed all through the day possibly for several days
Karby stood aghast
No one knew him
He was safe
But his heart sank
His two hundred deputies were on duty but violence might ensue and death might result
And this Karby wished to avoid
The instigators had done their parts thoroughly
Karby could tell by the stray bits of talk he picked up
millionaire who had been working for months cornering potatoes sugar eggs was ready to unload on the public at hitherto unheard of high prices
The people were to be robbed
He was one of the causes of the food shortage throughout the country
Karby stood bewildered by what he heard
He listened to threats against his life violence against the building which housed his provisions the provisions he had been weeks collecting for the relief of these poor deluded creatures
Karby censured himself for his lack of foresight
If he had only advertised his sales in the Saturday papers instead of waiting until Sunday all would have been well
But now
Tomorrows quotations would lead the FIGHTING THE EGG KING
people to believe that it was the mob that had forced him to the low prices and that they had not been his intention from the first
If only he could work his way to the front but this was impossible
He must stand here an idle spectator and await developments
And then the mob closed in pressed together made of itself body more com pact
great din arose
Shouts and jeers rent the air
Threats were no longer muttered beneath breaths or hissed into the ears of nearby companions but were shouted openly
few police perhaps thirty or forty appeared on the outskirts of the crowd and tried to disperse the people but mobs and riots were new to the police of this city and they were incompetent to handle the situation
The hope their presence had inspired in Karby died
By this time the rabble had pressed so close to the building that Karby was scarcely forty feet from it
He could see dim light burning through the windows and his deputies on guard armed to the teeth
The rioters increased their shouts and jeers
Waves of motion rippled over the mob as though they meant to rush the place and storm it by force
Some one presently hurled brick which crashed through window
At the noise of fall ing glass the crowd went crazy
Karby sickened
It was all over
They were on the verge of violence
His deputies might control the situation by the use of arms but this would be awful
Then suddenly the whole building blazed forth with light and made the surround ing scenery bright as day
Men could be seen hurrying to and fro in the store and presently in every window there was posted one of the huge placards bearing the prices which were to go into effect Monday morning
The jeers of the crowd died
Silence developed
Those who could read English perused the signs hungrily
Presently low hum rippled through the mob
They were translating to their companions what they saw
Again semblance of silence ensued as though the rabble were considering their course
This was intruded upon by yells of Its lie
Its game
Dont be lieve those signs and Karby knew these cries came from paid instigators
Some shouted to burn the place pro visions and all while others shrieked to storm it and carry the foodstuffs away
But the majority were quiet
The printed prices were there before their eyes
The multitude were plainly puzzled and perhaps disappointed
They had come to do violence
They were to be cheated of their prey
This was to be store for them
These prices were within their reach
There was something wrong
In vain did the instigators try to in cite violence try to rush the people for ward in great attacking movement
But the throngs were plainly stirred and Karby knew by the attitude of those near him that they had been impressed
The psychology of the mob is study
It is like torpedo it must be handled rightly or it may boomerang and attack those that assembled it
Some one suddenly shouted at the top of his lungs Lets get the egg king
Hes cornered eggs
He admits it
He asks what is the public going to do about it
Lets show him
To the egg kings house to the egg kings house Karby caught glimpse of the fellow who had raised the cry
It was the orator who had spoken that day on the train
In second the mob had taken up the slogan and Karby heard the noise of rushing feet and the next instant the whole mass swung into movement and dashed on their way
Karby was swept along with them
His mind worked fast
Once they gained Truxtons house the rage they would have vented on his store and food stuffs would burst forth with increased and added vigor
Karby dared not think THE ARGOSY
what they might do to the place
They were armed with all sorts of weapons and would as soon fire the mansion as any thing else and once this rabble under stood the real situation and it was like ly that some one in the crowd might stumble upon the truth at any second their rage would know no bounds
Karby thought frantically
He slowed his pace and permitted the rushing mad men to pass him
Presently he found himself so separated from the stragglers that he stopped altogether turned and made for his automobile
He gaified it jumped in swung past his building and sang out orders to his deputies to leave two or three of them on guard and for the others to hurry to the house of the egg king
The orders were received rather sullen ly and there were signs of rebellion but the promise of handsome reward if they saved the place effected the desired change and Karby was satisfied to see them start forth in pursuit of the mob to do what they could to quell the riot
Karby then took one of them into his car to show him the way to the Truxton house
Down one street up another they flew taking the shortest route in the effort to get there before the mob arrived
Karby could hear the rioters in the distance and urged his car to greater speed
At last huge residence loomed into view
Karby alighted and rushed through the spacious grounds up broad flight of front steps on to wonderful veranda and rang the bell
butler responded and Karby did not wait for ceremony but brushed past him into the house
He burst into room where he heard voices and threw into violent agitation Miss Truxton her mother and Truxton himself who was at deskphone in smiling conversation with somebody
The egg king was tall man well de veloped and broad
His hair was gray his eyes active but rather small and sparkling
He lowered the phone and stared aghast as Karby swept into the room and rushed toward him
Quick youve not minute to lose
Escape from this house at once
The mob you stirred up against me Truxton has turned on you and is now headed here shouting Get the egg kin get the egg king
They only stared at him apparently too overcome to comprehend what his words meant
Mrs Truxton sweet rather weak faced woman who looked as though her very life was dominated by this husband of hers showed signs of swooning Trux ton himself rose slowly to his feet
You are Karby he began and it was evident he intended working himself into rage but Karby interrupted him
Yes am Karby but for Gods sake hurry
That mob which your own agents stirred up is mad mad not alone out of belief in the justice of their cause but mad from the alcohol which your money furnished them
Do you want to be trapped here like rats
Theres no telling what they will do
They surrounded my storehouse threatened violence and wculd have demolished the place had not my deputies thought to flash in the windows the huge posters bearing the price list which will go into effect on Monday
Then the mob turned and with shout of Get the egg king stampeded down the street
came here to warn you its more than you deserve but dont want to see violence done
Listen He rushed to the window and threw it open
In the distance came the roar of the mob gathering in violence as the seconds flew
have turned my deputies in to try to quell them but there is no quelling that angry mob
They lust for destruc tion
Give your butler orders to get the servants out of the house and come your selves
Dont wait to order your car
have mine outside The police Truxton began with FIGHTING THE EGG KING
movement toward the phone but Karby stopped him
The police are powerless forty of them tried to quell the mob before my place and failed torrent of angry voices now burst upon the air
The sound brought aetion
Truxton pale and with set lips gave orders to the butler
Then Karby led them from the house to his machine and piloted the same to side street where he drew up and bade them wait while he went forward to see what he could do
Even as he started the noise increased to Bedlam and he saw the advance guard of the mob closing in on the Truxton place
They paused before it and waited until their number was sufficiently aug mented to begin violence
Karby saw that he was cut off from his deputies
He stood there wondering what to do when movement near him caused him to wheel about
Miss Truxton stood there beside him
came after you made them let me
Mr Karby want you to know that think you are white as the saying goes one of the whitest men have ever heard of
Father is impressed by your actions by your coming to warn us She shuddered and drew nearer to him as perfect howl and shriek of rage ascended from the mob
patrol wagon clattered by and dumped score or more of police who rushed at the mob with great flourish of clubs and pistols
But they were in timidated almost immediately and hadnt the courage to use firearms against this Bedlam of raving people
So they stood there trying to awe the crowd by their uniforms and shouting for them to disperse
The shout was answered by cries of derision and hoots of laughter and some one hurled missile which crashed through one of the Truxton windows
In second the house was bombarded with bricks and stones and clubs
The glass showered down like rain
The girl clutched Karby hand and hid her face in his shoulder
He threw his arm about her and tried to murmur words of comfort
At the same instant there came to him great idea
He bade her follow him rushed to corner and turned in fire alarm
In second it seemed the firebells were ringing and the apparatus could be heard in the distance the gongs clanging fero ciously
Karby went into the crowds and spoke word or two to the police who caught the idea immediately with drew to the street intersections and when the fire apparatus drew up ordered the firemen to attach the hose to the water plugs
This was done in minute the firemen realizing instantly that the power of dispersing the angry mob lay in their hands
The police gave the word and great streams of water came tearing from the nozzles with terrific force
These streams were turned directly on the mob
The throng was stunned
cry of rage went up
Those in the front ranks made rush at the firemen but the nearer they came the greater was the force of the water
The leaders paused irresolute
At the same time another stream and then an other and another were turned upon them
They were being soaked like drowning rats
Still they stood their ground too stunned and bewildered apparently to re treat
In another minute three more streams were deluging the crowd and at suggestion of Karby these latter streams were directed over the heads of the nearest in an effort to reach the out skirts of the throngs
This did the work
As the water descended on the stragglers in the rear they gave way thus making room for those in advance of them to re treat
At the same time the firemen rushed forward wielding their hose with deadly accuracy
Several men were knocked down by the force of the streams and the women in the crowd broke and flew for shelter
THE ARGOSY
This was signal to ply the water with greater agility and the firemen followed up their advantage as the now bewildered mob gave way
Presently the rioters broke helter skelter and in one mad plunge turned and fled getting away from the merciless torrents as best they could
In another ten minutes the streets were clear
Heloise Truxton drew close to Karby and as they started back for the machine she told him softly came to you today because knew my father and his agents were go ing to recruit mob to try to demolish your great store
made him promise to let me come and make the proposi tion to buy your eggs
If you had agreed there would have been no mob
want ed to save you even though didnt know then who you were
failed and the mob was organized and they turned against my father and would have burned us out had it not been for you
We father would have deserved it all and yet you stood by us warned us to flee and then helped us to get here and it was your idea that brought the firemen oh you are splendid Mr Karby just splendid Not splendid Karby told her
warned your people not because of any idea of returning good for evil but be cause of you
wanted to save you
Thats why did it He stopped her in the darkness of some trees and faced her
Do you understand that he said
He took her by the hands and looked into her eyes
It was for you
would have gone through fire to save you She swayed toward him
Karby never knew just how it happened but the next instant she was in his arms and he was holding her tight
Her face was upturned to him and on sudden he stooped and kissed her
Her lips were not unresponsive but yielded with warmth that thrilled him to the soul
He murmured words to her which were for her ear alone and her arms came up and tightened about his neck
And then the city rocked with the roar of an explosion that made the very ground beneath Karby and the girl tremble
The concussion was awful
Karby disengaged her held her at arms length and stared in the direction of his store
There came faint illumina tion from that point and then the heavens flamed with deep red glare and Karby saw tongues of fire shooting up and up and up and gaining ground as the seconds went by
He lowered his head and stood there picture of dejection despair
The girl threw her arms about his neck and asked him what it was said she was afraid
But Karby stared down into her eyes
Its all right Miss Truxton
Ive got you and Im going to keep you marry you
Bit your father has won
with drew my deputies to help fight this mob
Your fathers agents got in their work
That explosion came from my store
They have fired it
He wins
His comer in eggs is safe
The people lose
Im sorry Hawthorne Daniel GAN wiped the sweat from his fore head with muscular forearm
He stood for moment gazing at the glaring blaze of one of his furnaces and mumbled something to himself
Then he turned and resumed his toil
aint got any nerve he muttered as he swung his filled scoop up to the furnace door scattering the coal over the fire
aint got any nerve He shoveled fiercely for minute and slammed the door
Then he straightened up and leaned against his shovel
And everybody on the ship knows it too he added
vivid picture of the shameful scene of an hour before came to him
Why had he not fought when Fisher gave him the lie before the others on the pier
Thats it he mumbled aint got any nerve He paused and narrowed his eyes
But Ill show em yet Egan was one of dozen stokers on the Ardmore small dirty British steam er loading at dock in Brooklyn for Liverpool
Already the ship was filled until the little white circle placed by Lloyds on her streaked side was splashed by every wave
The big tarpaulins were being unrolled over the hatches by group of deck hands and man was taking down the metal disks that kept the rats from journeying over the cables that led to the pier
The second engineer had finished his inspection of the engines and was watching the steady rise of pressure in the steamgages on the big boilers un der which the stokers were stirring up the fires
They were all but ready to start to sea
The stokers not on duty had been given the day ashore and had taken ad vantage of it in the oldfashioned sailor way
Every one of them had returned with more stimulants under his belt than were good for him
Egan had been with the bunch but had taken less than the others not be cause he wanted less but because he knew that if he took any more before going to work in the overheated stoke hole it would go to his head and he would have to be carried out
That might lose him his berth
The rough crowd had made day of it day to remember
They spent all of their money and most of their energy
They were peaceable enough until their feet touched the splintered planks of the pier
Then they could not resist little rough play before going aboard
They pushed each other awkwardly about as they trouped gaily down the pier
In the horseplay Egan was shoved forcibly and fell over cable that lay stretched across his path
He hurt him self just enough to make him angry
THE ARGOSY
Youre drunk shouted Fisher as Egan rose to his feet
Youre drunk aint drunk returned the angry Egan
You are insisted Fisher
Youre drunker fool aint growled Egan
only had two drinks You lie yelled Fisher aggressively holding his muscular elbows out from his body
You held dozen Egan turned
The others of the party cleared away from the pair expecting what was to them the logical outcome of so gross an insult
To their utter amazement Egan only glared at Fisher only stared him in the eye for moment
Then he quailed be fore the smaller man and boarded the ship without word
some one shouted and the others jeered
Fisher guffawed loudly in his drunken glee
Egan went to the forecastle changed his clothes and was ready before the others of his shift
They said nothing when they came up
They only poked each other and grinned
Their shift was called and they slid down the slippery ladders into the black pit to feed the fur naces
The engineroom bell jingled and the engines started
When Egan climbetl to the deck after his watch below the ship was gliding through the Narrows flying row of flags from her signal halyard
ragged smudge drifted from the big funnel toward the Staten Island shore almost blotting out battleship that lay anchored there
Egan stood by the rail for minute
Then he went forward to wash up
Regularly he took his shift and regu larly he came on deck after the grinding toil to stand by the rail for minute
Always his thoughts for that minute were the same How can show em aint quitter In the sixteen days that followed no one spoke to him except when it was necessary
He grew sullen and deliber ately kept away from the others
He fretted over it and could think of no way to reinstate himself in the good graces of his fellows
The ship was nearing the end of the voyage
The skipper checked their posi tion on chart and called the engineer
They talked quietly for minute
The engineer nodded and returned to the engineroom
He gave an order and the sweating stokers worked furiously in the dim light of the dingy pit
They watched their fires carefully
They shoveled and poked and shoveled again
They worked like slaves and the quivering hands on the pressuregage gradually rose
Five pounds ten pounds and the pop valve on Egans boiler opened
It hissed malevolently for moment and closed
The shovels clanged against the furnace doors and scraped under the piles of coal
Then one of the stokers collapsed
He was carried to ventilator and another stoker was called
He dropped down the ladder and took his place
At first Egan did not notice who had come
Then as furnace door was thrown open the glare lit up the heavy body and bullet head of Fisher working at the next fire
Egan said nothing
He only worked harder
The furnaces roared
The gagehands quivered on the dials
The men worked furiously expending every effort
Fisher dripped sweat and panted as he shoveled
The men looked like goblins in the glare and heat
The old steamer plowed through the sea with more foam before her nose than she had ever raised before
The captain was smiling as he stood on the bridge
The engineer was lean ing against polished rail in the engine room
He reached into his pocket pulled out plug of tobacco bit it and thought of the baby he would see in its mothers arms when they docked at Liverpool in the morning
Everything was running smoothly
Egan closed the door of furnace with WHAT HAPPENED BELOW
He straightened up to rest his aching back
He threw back his shoul ders and as he did so tremendous ex plosion shook the ship
Her bow lifted high into the air
The stokers in the grimy pit slid scrambling across the tilted metal deck straight for the heated fronts of the furnaces
Egan thrust out his shovel and saved himself
He reached out with one long arm and grasped Fisher jusf as the man was about to fall against the hot metal
The ship rolled back and the stokers made dash for the ladder
The trim mers darted from the bunkers and in mad fighting group they tried to force their way to the only escape
Egans heart was pounding rapidly
For moment he almost joined the rush
Then he saw stream of dirty water trickle through crack in the bulkhead
He thought of the boilers that would explode if the water reached them
With leap he reached the frightened men at the foot of the ladder
He flung them aside and stood with his back to the only escape from the pit
Get back he shouted
Get back an pull your fires They pushed toward him
Fisher made leap for the ladder
Egan struck him in mid air with his powerful fist
He crumpled up and sprawled out on the floor
The others crowded forward ter ror showing in their eyes
Egan swung his arms like flails batter ing their flesh as they advanced
In their fear they made no effort to return his blows
They halted staring wide eyed at the demon in front of them
He advanced step
Pull them fires he bellowed shak ing his huge fists in the air
Pull em damn you pull em Keeping wary eye on every man be fore him Egan reached for his long handled rake
He pushed the uncon scious Fisher aside with his foot
For moment the others watched him sheeplike
One started suddenly for the ladder
Egan stepped back and struck him
The man staggered his mouth bleeding
He looked at Egan for an in stant
Then he turned and opened the furnace doors
The others did the same
The burning coals tumbled from the grates and hissed into the water that washed about the floor
It grew deeper forward
Egan paused for moment to haul the still unconscious Fisher onto pile of coal
The fires were ptilled and still the men hesitated
Steam was filling the dingy place
The water continued to rise
Fumes from the coals on the floor all but strangled the men
Break the watergages roared Egan
Groping in the darkening pit the men reached for shovels and rakes
They broke the glass gages
Steam and scald ing water poured into the place
Now beat it shouted Egan
The men swarmed rapidly up the lad der
Egan waited until they disappeared in the steam
The water had risen to his knees
He strode through it to the pile of coal on which lay Fisher moaning now amid the choking fumes and steam
Egan picked him up
The electric lights sud denly went out
The inrush of water had lessened but the steam was awful
Egan gasped for air and splashed through the blackness
He groped for the ladder in the dark
For moment he could not find it
terrible fear gripped him
Then his outstretched hand grasped rung
With Fisher on his shoulder he started to climb
He tried to hold his breath against the gases and the steam
He reached land ing gasping and fell against another lad der
This he clutched and climbed again
Sunlight streamed through com panionway
Wearily he walked out onto the listed deck and let Fisher slip gently from his shoulder
He saw British de stroyer standing by its thin bow twisted
She rammed em said some one be side him
Thats where they went down Egan looked and saw little distance THE ARGOSY
off large uneven stain upon the water
It was oil
Rapidly it grew larger and from beneath it steady stream of bub bles wobbled slowly to the surface and broke
Egan leaned against the rail and with his minds eye saw ghastly struggle against violent death far down beneath the quiet water where the crushed sub marine was sending up its dying gasps with each bubble that broke on the sur face
How much waters in the hold de manded the captain of no one in par ticular
Not very much sir answered Egan in funny little voice
And the fires are pulled
dont believe well sink sir He leaned weakly against the rail
He heard some one tell the captain of the fight in the stokehole
He listened and tired smile crept over his face
Well he muttered to himself showed em but my Gawd was scared PHYLLIS ON PULLMAN WAS on bounding Pullman car That like vision from afar In matchless beauty tress of gold And eyes to turn the arctic cold To tropic shimmer with their glance And ways suggesting song and dance She dawned and held me neath spell No words can adequately tell But oh good Lord
When evening fell my how she snored The cries of Indians lifting scalps
The avalanches of the Alps
The roar of cannon and of shot
The echoes of some mammoth grot
The scream of seagulls in their flight
The song of treetoads in the night
The oompah of the big bassoon
The honk of some impending loon All got aboard And swelled the tune that Phyllis snored
Mozart and Verdi both were there And hints of Wagner filled the air And every dissonance in life Was added to the nasal strife That permeated near and far Each nook and cranny of the car And made me feel as if trod Some battlefields encrimsoned sod Where nations warred Steelarmed and shod as on she snored
Oh Maxim great or Edison It matters not to me which one Wilt thou not take this chance in mind And for the good of all mankind Some day from out thy genius rare Devise an instrument with care sort of nasal silencer To still the tumult and the whir That wholly floored My heart when lovely Phyllis snored

oar Lenivers Carew HE people all around here are keyed up to quite pitch of ex citement George Eastman had just come back from the quaint little general store of the tropical seaside town bearing can of petrol for roadcar in which he and his wife were touring the French island colony
Its all over the homecoming of famous criminal and outlaw man named Victor Berard continued East man as he prepared to feed the volatile fluid to the hungry machine
He has been doing tenyear term in the penal colony of New Caledonia and is such desperate character that his return to the islands fills the natives with dread which they seem to find almost delight ful
Berard it seems is singularly savage and ferocious and has the most amazing courage deadshot with rifle and pistol and terrible artist with the knife
These people are absolutely ecstatic over the prospect of being slaughtered in their houses as soon as he returns to resume his depredations
could hardly per suade them to sell me the petrol there was such buzz of gossip in the store Wed better put our car on the first ship thats leaving and get away from here before the terror begins said Louise Eastman with nervous little laugh
dont think Id care for the tropical variety of Robin Hood
fancy that Victor Berard is sort of island tradition sniffed her husband with shrug
These emotional people cherish their bad men you know and paint them and their escapades in vivid colors
Dont worry about it the return of Berard will add another note of ro mance to the tales we shall hear The sublime extravagance of going halfway round the world by motor will come near enough to ruining us George said his wife without having dis tinguished bandit capture and hold us for ransom am already disappointed in ouf dis tinguished bandit chuckled Eastman
He would have had something more than ten years at hard labor if he had done anything splendidly devilish
Im afraid that sober analysis will narrow his depredations down to sheep stealing or something sordid like that
We may as well forget him and go about our business
managed to extract few bits of in THE ARGOSY
formation there at the store in spite of the breathless chatter about the bandit
Theres tiny primitive but highly re spectable inn about halfway down the south shore of the island and it will ap parently do very well for our dinner and nights lodging
The innkeepers wife speaks and cooks in French Spanish and English and the man himself sells supplies for motorcars in at least two languages With pleasant prospect of savory meal and decent lodging on the shore of lately savage island they motored along the sandy beach road glistening with shells of pearl and amber and opal hues and lapped soothingly by the gentle sap phire sea
In place of the cawing crows of the travelers home cornfields green and scarlet parrots screamed in the tops of the coconutpalms and the small animals that scrambled among the branches were monkeys not squirrels
Proceeding at leisurely speed to miss nothing of the novel scenery they came toward sundown to the inn that had been described
It was mere cottage of coral slabs and palm thatch but clean and pleasantly harmonious with the landscape
In the driveway that led to the house vagrant nail perhaps one of many pierced the shoe and tube of front tire and the loud pop of the blowout brought Monsieur Tournier forth with suspicious alacrity and eager offers of new tube and skilful patching of the shoe
It was evident Eastman whispered to his wife that the traditional thrift of the French peasant was not affected by the languor of the tropical trade winds
It was clearly necessary however for the host to keep an eye to the main chance even to the sprinkling of the road with nails for it was the offseason for tour ists and the four guestrooms of the inn were vacant when the Americans arrived
We heard in the town of the sensa tional return of your island hero and villain Victor Berard Eastman re marked to Mme
Tournier as she served the guests with delectable combination of herbs and sea food and handsomely turned omelet
Ma joi yes it is terrible monsieur exclaimed the woman with an elaborate shudder
Ten years you see we have had peace without that apache he should more better have been sent to the galleys for life think
Now he comes again
Is he really so horrible Mrs East man inquired
Or do the people fear for their chickenroosts and gardens Mme
Tournier sighed profoundly
she wailed
If Victor Ber ard desired chicken it is not that he would visit the chickencoop he would come to my door and order that the chicken should be cooked for him aux champignons sauce piquante
No madame it is no joke
Victor Berard is terrible fellow
He desires some money
Does he rob man of his purse
No he goes to the town and demands the money of hundred men he would fear thousand no more
In the street full of people Victor Berard speaks and all the men they stop and grow pale
Ah he is the devil When Victor Berard shoot the pis tol supplemented Tournier stand ing by his wife always man die the bullet is in his heart
When he flash the knife already man lie dead in Blood
But when some man he shoot Victor Ber ard poof
Berard he is not dead he shake himself like the bull or the lion he is all right Ten years at hard labor will have sobered him bit perhaps suggested Eastman
Nevair declared the Frenchman with grim conviction
Does the tiger grow tame in the cage monsieur
Victor Berard he will now seek his revenge upon the whole world
He will demand much money from us all and we must pay or die But you have police service here in the islands monsieur
exclaimed Mrs Eastman
THE JACKALS MIGHTY ROAR
The innkeeper shut one eye mysteri ously and put his tongue in his cheek
Victor Berard have many friends madame he said pointedly
It was an officer of the police who was killed that Victor had to go away to prison but it was for ten years only because the officer had fired his pistol first
Many men had died before but always it was that Victor fired his shot in selfdefense you see
Some of his good friends were very large men in the colony and that makes the difference The evening meal was finished with sweety pancakes cheese and coffee and after that the guests sat in the large general room and were regaled by their hosts with marvelous tales of the desper ate escapades and achievements of the celebrated outlaw
little later the innkeeper excused himself to set about the repairing of the motorcars tires against the earlymorn ing departure of the guests and Mme
Toumier took upon herself the burden of the entertainment
adore stories of adventure Mme
Tournier said Mrs Eastman but dont know how well shall sleep to night
hope that your desperados ship will not arrive until we are well away from the islands Ah but it was to arrive in port to day the woman assured her unfeelingly
Victor Berard he may be already en gaged in evil adventures Then for mercys sake let us talk of the scenery and other pleasant things for the rest of the evening begged the lady affecting an air of terror
man was hpard walking along the hard shell road
Hola he cried loudly halting be fore the inn and Tournier hurried out to meet him
Bon soir et Mme
Tournier thundered the stranger
The innkeeper fell back pace and stared through the starlit gloom
Victor Berard he almost yelled in mingled consternation and surprise
Tournier with even less re straint emitted shriek
The two Americans sat breathless with amazement and vague sort of expect ancy as the celebrated outlaw swaggered into the room
The welcome you give me old friends said the returned convict harsh ly is noisy even if it lacks warmth
Cofne show some joy at my return
Bring me at once bottle of that Beau jolais of eighteenninetysix friend Toumier He threw himself luxuriously into chair near the American visitors then peered at the latter curiously and waved them bluff greeting
Distinguished travelers from Europe or America see he exclaimed boldly
Iam honored by such company
Tour nier the visitors will join me in three bottles of the Beaujolais thousand thanks monsieur ex claimed George Eastman but madame and have finished our dinner and we shall soon retire to rest after day of fatigue am Victor Berard the man an nounced belligerently
You know
When offer entertainment it is not re fused monsieur We will wait to take just one glass of the wine with Berard said Mrs Eastman in conciliatory but rather tremulous voice
adame is as gracious as she is beautiful exclaimed the outlaw with an insolent grin
He turned and peered sharply at the innkeeper as the latter obediently brought in the bottles of wine
Friend Tournier he said have returned to my beloved islands with empty pockets
am unhappily forced to trouble you for assistance at once
need twenty five thousand francs Tournier deposited the bottles on the table with thud and began to tremble with an ague of terror
Have mercy Berard he cried brokenly
You should know well that THE ARGOSY
have not quarter of so much money in all the world and that to give you even thousand francs would ruin me
Tournier threw her apron over her head and burst into dismal wails rocking her body backward and forward and wringing her hands
shall quickly learn for myself how much you have Tournier declared the bandit
You know how gently deal with liars
Tournier whimpered and his wife sprang to her feet and howled incoherent ly for mercy
am not easily moved by womans tears Mme
Tournier said Berard im patiently much less when they are shed in cloudbursts to the accompani ment of such devilish howling
Be quiet now or your sniveling husband shall be made to gag you By all the saints Berard cried the innkeeper brokenly am speaking to you with truth and honesty
Would you then ruin poor dog who has worked so hard for the little he has We shall see how far the poor dog shall be ruined muttered the outlaw settling back comfortably in his chair
It occurs to me friends that travelers from distant lands must be well furnished with money
Come now we shall see that my desperate need has already touched the generous hearts of this lovely lady and her gallant husband
They will come to your relief Tournier
May it not be that in their liberality they will endow me with ah
not mere twenty five thousand but with fifty thousand francs
It will be beautiful sublime
Yes yes that is an end to all my press ing problems of the moment fear that you jest rather broadly monsieur Eastman said quietly
am not unwilling to help fellow traveler on his way with few francs from my pocket but my wife and are spending even more than we can well afford on our travels and we are not wealthy persons by any means
Americans are protected by their government at home you know from such dangers as capture for ransom and blackmail
Any unpleasantness you might be rash enough to cause us would quickly grow into an international affair
That would mean too much publicity for you you see and you would hardly get off with ten years in New Caledonia
You are man of evident intelligence Berard and think make myself clear The outlaw sprawled over the table and leered at the American
Fifty thousand francs he said with emphasis upon each word
The money must be paid at once or shall lose pa tience
Let us then have no more fool ish talk If it is not paid Eastman queried meeting the mans ugly glance unflinch ingly
Berard took sip of wine then languid ly drew from his pocket huge navy revolver which he placed beside him on the table with elaborate care
Why then he said at last if the money is not paid the affair will become melancholy tragic
The lovely madame will suddenly become lovely widow and shall have the honor of being her escort upon her travels
It is too simple to need more explanation monsieur Look here note of deep concern sounded in Eastmans voice as he saw his wifes face blanch refuse to take this outrageous affair seriously
You are not fool you must know what row you would kick up by making any trouble for us
The world is too small for such villainy as you suggest Berard
As matter of fact if the lives of both my self and my wife were actually at stake we could not in any way raise such sum as fifty thousand francs particularly in this part of the earth Make me an offer drawled Berard with the suavity of tradesman
Great Heavens
Im not haggling with you cried Eastman angrily
havent the slightest thought of being in danger from you and wouldnt give you sou
Youre an impudent swash buckler youve played upon the ignorant THE JACKALS MIGHTY ROAR
fears of the natives here and youve got an exaggerated idea of your importance
dont care snap of the fingers for you or for your threats
Come Lou he added to his trem bling wife well go to our room and tomorrow Ill see the proper authorities about the outrageous actions of this bully Have care monsieur spoke up the innkeeper in shaking voice
Believe me you do not know half the evil that Berard is capable of
You are braver man than monsieur but you will pay great price for your defiance
speak as friend Victor Berard took the big revolver from the table and his thick stubby forefinger crooked indolently around the trigger
You talk like an American and fool
he said to Eastman harshly
Do not try to leave the room
If you reach the door monsieur it will be as dead man stretched across the threshold
Your wife will then have the choice of go ing with me or of dying do not permit women to worry me
will have money tonight or you cannot live until the morning You are weaving terrible net around yourself Berard declared Eastman tensely and his face had grown as white as that of his wife
You can gain nothing from this folly but return to prison
With my travelers letter of credit and all the credentials that have could not raise more than five thousand francs at the American consuls office
And even so would not give you the smallest part of that
Now think well of what you are doing Go to the American consul now or dered the outlaw and bring me the five thousand francs
will take that and we shall see what will come later
Your wife will remain here and shall wait two hours for you to make the journey in your motor
Yes will be gracious will take the five thousand francs believe you are insane said East man
Do you think that if went to the consuls office would not return di rectly with police with French marines with all the authority that could get back of me
Your frank assurance is ridiculous
Not at all monsieur replied the outlaw blandly
am not child
Of certainty you could get the police company of marines if you wished
But it would be sorrow for you mon sieur to find your beautiful wife with her throat cut when you arrived with your police
Is it not so
While you are gone madame will sit here and my pistol will point at her heart
When you re turn to this room shall know instantly whether madame is to live or to die
can shoot very quickly monsieur
Ha ha
You see it now he went on chuckling
Myself take no chances
With man alone it would be different but with the lovely lady as forfeit have no fears
Now go Mrs Eastman spoke suddenly in despairing wail
Give him all we have George she said
The man is savage
How can we expect reason or mercy from him Madame is endowed with brains as well as beauty exclaimed the outlaw
It would be thousand pities to spoil such beauty or to spill such excellent brains
Do not delay monsieur George Eastman stood with clenched hands his face working convulsively
You are the first man have ever wanted to kill he declared
The outlaw shrugged his shoulders
Myself have no fierce emotions like that he said virtuously
should like to avoid killing you monsieur
No it would not be pleasant to kill either you or madame
Eastman looked at his wife long and earnestly
His eyes blazed with hot an ger and resentment and he longed to at tack the desperado and take his chances but the piteous hopeless face of the frail woman unnerved him
Well then he said suddenly with THE ARGOSY
sigh of bitter dejection Ill go
But warn you Berard that if give you the money it will not be an end of the affair Get the money and make haste muttered the outlaw grinning content edly
It is terrible Eastman that such crime should be committed in my house moaned Tournier but you are wise to yield before there is bloodshed
We know this man and he has no mercy You see what my dear friends say of me exclaimed the outlaw happily
The American ignoring the brute and his gun went to his wife and took her in his arms
He whispered encouragement of sort to her and begged her to be brave and patient in the ordeal while he went to the town and talked with the United States consul
It might be he told her boldly that way would be found to circumvent the scoundrel with out risking danger or disaster
am quick shot and sure one warned Berard
Be sure that will keep my word Eastman embraced his wife tenderly then sprang away from her and walked to the door
shall be back in an hour if it is possible he said quietly
If the hour stretches out too far said Berard shall take madame in my arms and console her
find myself al ready growing foolish with tender emo tions Take care that dont kill you cried Eastman and stepped forth reso lutely into the night
Without help from Tournier he got his car from the shed at the rear of the inn made certain that the engine and the tires were in working order and then started at high speed for the distant town his heart beating faster than the valves of the motor
It was late in the evening and the con sul might be hard to find
What then
And if he was in his office could he cash the letters of credit without infinite com ing and going and hours of delay
With the money secured and paid to the ban dit what would the travelers do then without means and so many thousand miles from home
Thus his mind ran on in turmoil of apprehension and excitement and he drove the motorcar over the hard white road at prodigious speed
Suddenly the throbbing rataplan of the engine stopped and the car coasted for thousand yards under the impetus of its speed then slowed down and stopped
Eastman sprang out and threw open the hood in frenzy of anxiety
There was tense moment of inspection then the man cried out and shouted at the car as though it were living creature
It might run again after an hour or two of laborious tinkering but in the present emergency it would not move for any man
He shrieked madly at the thing to have mercy on him and rally to his need but the machinery remained stolidly in ert with sort of grim fatality
He heard all at once far off the faint sound of wheels and drumming of hoofs and he cried out in wild expectan cy
Unable to wait he ran swiftly down the road to meet the approaching vehicle and when he was panting for breath and almost exhausted he came upon two wheeled native cart pony drawn and occupied by single man
He tried English words upon the way farer and there was an encouraging re sponse
Turn your cart around and take me to the town and make your price what you will
he gasped as soon as he could breathe
But monsieur it is very late and my own destination is far off the driver protested courteously
Eastman explained frantically that he was the victim of treacherous motor and that he must get to the town
You will do well to wait until morn ing it is now so late advised the stran ger
There is good inn some distance THE JACKALS along the road and will take you there But came from that accursed place just now cried the American
tell you sir it is matter of life and death and you must take me to the town Ah some person is very ill mur mured the driver
Then that is differ ent
But there is an English doctor here on the road will take you to his house Must tell you everything groaned Eastman beside himself
have to see the United States consul have to get money at once
money to save the life of my wife
Is that enough for your curiosity Monsieur is excited observed the other with maddening ease of manner
But you give me mystery to puzzle over my friend
It is very strange that madame your wife her life may be saved by money
The situation is peculiar Eastman swore at the man he assailed him with frightful epithets and dire threats but scarcely disturbed his equa nimity
But if you must have the whole story why have it then he stormed
intend that the world shall have it to morrow so whats the difference
my poor wife and are the victims of your precious islands hero Victor Ber ard
Ah exclaimed the man blandly
Continue monsieur if you please The beast returned from ten years imprisonment today as you doubtless know Eastman hurried on and he se lected us as the first victims of his new career of crime
My wife is half dead with fright
He holds her prisoner at the inn ready to kill her if do not bring the money do you see
If summon the police he will kill her and if fail to get the money he may kill us both
Now will you take me to the house of the consul The driver appeared vastly interested but scarcely perturbed
Monsieur has had no previous expe MIGHTY ROAR
rience with bandits he exclaimed
But that is not strange at this day they are not so common
Eh bien mon sieur you will permit me to help you as friend
Be good enough to get up here beside me
We will drive to the inn The devil we will cried Eastman aghast
Man alive that will do no good it may be fatal Have the goodness to follow my ad vice persisted the stranger
will talk to this Victor Berard and show him clearly the folly of his actions
He will listen to me promise you on my oath monsieur He will shoot you dead declared the American
The man shrugged his shoulders and threw back the front of his jacket ex posing to view the butt of revolver that hung in holster at his waist
We shall meet on even terms mon sieur he said quietly
Vaguely bewildered and exhausted by his prolonged frenzy Eastman mounted to the seat of the cart reluctantly
He started fresh series of objections to the mans proposals but the native cut him short by starting the pony abruptly and whipping it into wild run flinging the cart sickeningly from one side of the road to the other
Eastman clung to the sides and kept his seat with difficulty and the jolting of the vehicle precluded further argument
As they drew near the inn the driver pulled the pony to an easy trot but he made no further attempt to diminish the sounds of their approach
Be good enough to get down here monsieur he said presently that may appear to be alone if am observed
When reach the door and enter you may follow quickly Eastman dropped to the ground hun dred yards from the house in deep shad ow and waited
He was dumbly obe dient now for there was certain author ity in the mans speech and actions which reassured him and gave him something like hope
THE ARGOSY
He watched his mysterious friend as he drove up to the inn and got
down from the cart
He saw him casually tie the horse to post and saunter up to the door then he followed directions and scurried forward keeping in the shadows
When he reached die door it was open and there were loud voices sounding from the room
In flash he saw his friend engaged with the terrible Victor Berard and he darted into the room and seized his sobbing wife in his arms
The cartdriver held the outlaw by the collar of his shirt with one hand and with the other hand he dealt him prodig ious blows across the face
Crimson welts appeared where the hand rose and fell and between howls of agony the fa mous outlaw shrieked that his nose was broken
This is the beginning announced the stranger desisting for moment
Also it is punishment too mild
At tend to what say
You have fright ened lady to distraction you have dis turbed gentleman traveling in strange land and you have masqueraded as better man
What punishment is ap propriate then
You mean that this fellow is not Vic tor Berard cried out Eastman bewil dered and incredulous
The stranger stepped back struck an attitude and pointed at the moaning out law derisively
Victor Berard he said dramatically has been described as handsome man
Would any one but the unfortunate mother of this goat call him handsome
Victor Berards enemies call him brave he went on oratorically
Could any one mistake this whimpering booby for brave man
Victor Berard was outlawed and sent into exile but when did he prey upon travelers and upon frail women
Victor Berard believe me might throw the pal ace of prince into panic but he would not seek adventure in the parlor of an inn
Eastman utterly aghast glanced cu riously at Toumier and his wife and was further puzzled
The keepers of the inn were apparently quite as terrified as they had been before their faces were drawn and of the color of yellowed ivory
They shrank back together close to the wall and stared at the stranger in sort of fascination
Now resumed the person of myste rious authority we shall get this canaille out of our atmosphere and he grasped the culprit again by the collar and flung him upon the floor
Have mercy monsieur pleaded the wretch who had lately swag gered so recklessly
will spare your life if do not meet you again said the stranger
ship leaves the island tomorrow see to it that your departure is simultaneous with hers
This island is my home do not wish that travelers should find such rats as you upon it The cringing clown whimpering soft ly crept furtively toward the open door
He gained the threshold and rose to something nearer standing posture and then the stranger took long stride after him and administered the worlds record kick propelling him like rocket through the darkness
At the same moment the administrator of picturesque justice whipped the re volver from his belt and fired fusillade of shots into the air at random
They heard the terrified clown running on the road moment later running perhaps as athletes sometimes dream of running
Now you and Mme
Toumier thundered the stranger turning suddenly upon the innkeepers with face dark with wrath
But why began Eastman
These old foxes also must leave my island said the stranger
The rat who masqueraded as man is their precious son and he was but playing out their shrewd scheme to wring money from credulous travelers Have pity monsieur wailed the THE JACKALS woman
We shall starve we have nothing if we leave here
Out with you commanded the avenger
See that you take the ship tomorrow
Tonight you shall walk to the town
Monsieur and madame the American travelers shall sleep in peace and will keep the inn You have indeed saved us from ridiculous but horrible adventure MIGHTY ROAR
monsieur said George Eastman step ping forward with outstretched hand
My wife and will never be able to ex press our gratitude
Whom have we the honor The stranger interrupted him with an elaborate bow of studied grace
The honor is mine monsieur and madame to be your humble servant Victor Berard he said
THE FOOL HE Prince sat on his carved throne And wine from gold he quaffed The Seer in drear dull monotone Read of his sagacraft The Bard stood near musing alone Watching the breezes waft The roseleaves through the window on The Fool who sang and laughed To you Prince the power of lord That force almost divine Of right of might and law of sword Arid rule of fear malign That wait but for your spoken word Nor need another sign

And Seer of what import the spark Of wisdom from the school
You Bard how can ye laud the Lark When those hot lips are cool
trow when we the Summons hark Id rather be the Fool Raymond Ashley Tke Eook rBy tKevlEditor FRANKLY admit that rule of The Argosy is transgressed in the opening para graph of the July complete novel
The story does not start off with bang this in spite of the fact that it leads our Fourth of July number
Nevertheless there is bang and it comes ahead of the first paragraph
You get it in the title McPHEES SENSATIONAL REST BY GEORGE FOXHALL Author of Those Eyes from Kama Why There Was Murder on Pearl Street etc
and you get it good and plenty in the story itself which is all about distinguished young novelist seeking change from work and persistent woman who lands him in the midst of happenings beside which wars wild alarms are almost tame
Mc Phees Sensational Rest in short moves with the rapidity of machine gun leaving the reader fairly breathless at the finish
For those of you who like outoftheordinary tales the July number will provide JIMMIE BARTLETTS BARGAIN BY JOHNSTON in which trade between rich and poor leads to extraordinary complications
The Empress of the Paper Hoops by Olin Lyman is Fourth of July yarn with circusy flavor and what happens when patriotism runs counter to the call of love is set forth in FOR THE SAME FLAG BY NEIL MORAN There are many other rarely attractive features in the July Argosy but theres big mail from my readers awaiting attention so Ill now step aside myself and let you talk to one another
FINDING BALM FOR FACT IN FICTION wonder if you all arent as pleased as am when answers are made to my request to be told how each one came to know The Argosy
Drop me line about this
Meanwhile heres new fashion in which fellow became ac quainted with publication that was destined to give him great deal of pleasure
Kingman Arizona
have just laid down the March Argosy and wish to say that the February and March issues have been exceptionally enjoyed
FourForty at the Fort Penn was good story THE LOGBOOK
which believe enjoyed more than One Cylinder Sam and that is saying great deal
Most magazines improve gradually but The Argosy seems to come forward by leaps and bounds
note that you request in the LogBook that we relate what it was that first attracted us to The Argosy
In my case it was more of case of sympathy than anything else
In the spring of was stranded in small town in Tennessee and happening to pass news stand and noting The Arcosy story Up Against It felt that if the fellow who wrote that story had any solution for the problem that could be applied to my case was strong for him
Since have missed but few num bers of The Argosy this being due to the newsstands running out of it before got around
am moving most of the time and have to depend upon the newsstands instead of regular subscription
In all the country there is not bunch of authors that hand out as much pleasure as The Argosy writers and have no criticism to make on any of them
YOUR FAVORITE STORY Here you are readers letter that opens the way for flow of opinions from you on more than one topic
After all not the length but the strength of story is the thing and do not believe in hampering the author by rules and regulations when genius burns
good idea this of Mr Padgetts as to what story each reader liked best
Im waiting to hear from you
Andalusia Alabama
enclose herewith one dollar for my re newal
The Argosy is the best ever and only one thing would cause me to quit reading it and that would be to make it weekly publication instead of monthly
do not have time to read weekly magazine for recently tried that on the AllStory Weekly beginning with the opening chapters of The Matrimaniac This story was good and read it all but havent had time to read the other stories in the copies that bought
want to entreat you to quit drawing the serials out so long
Please change your mode of printing them back to the old style of three instalments each divided into three parts
Three serials each month with one going out and new one coming in in each issue is in my estimation much better way than the present method
realize that the serials hold subscribers but the suggestion have offered will not interfere with this and will give the readers the entire serial while the first part is still fresh in their memory
The present method of drawing serial out from five to seven months is objectionable because when the last is reached the first is too far away and is not clearly remembered
Please take vote on this and see if the majority of your readers do not prefer serials in three instalments
would like to know through the LogBook just what story each reader liked best
That is just what story fitted in and reminded them of some part of their life
liked The Third Act better than any other for the reason that it almost completely followed certain chapter of my life
Hoping that you dont forget to con tract the serials am
ITS THE STORY THAT COUNTS The magic of circulationbuilding is ex plained in the simple act related in the sub joined letter
Somebody likes certain story in The Argosy hands it to friend to read and presto another unit is added to the maga zines clientele
Which story in the present issue say do any of you consider worth recom mending to friend
Syracuse New York
Please find enclosed one dollar to pay for my renewal to The Argosy which have read for long time
The first Argosy remember reading had Trolley Tangle in it and friend considered the story so good that the book was handed to me and at once became an admirer of The Argosy
always liked Hawkins but will abide by
the decision of the majority and forget him
In regard to authors never notice an authors name
Its the story that counts with me not the author
Hoping that this escapes the scrapheap am Harold Gutterson
THE PULL OF THE SERIAL especially commend the subjoined to those readers who want us to abolish serials
They are the anchor to windward that steadies circu lation
Without serials Mr Graham would very likely have waited for the March number when he found he was too late for February
Ukiah California
Enclosed find ten cents worth of stamps to pay for the February Argosy
was too late to get it from the town near which live
think The Argosy is about the best magazine have read
have not subscribed for it yet but intend to later
The Motive Daring the Danger Zone and The Gilded Trap are very good stories and as they are continued in the February Arcosy is why am so anxious to get it
Diahl Graham
PREFERS THE LONG SERIAL Mr Rich runs squarely counter to the pref erences of Mr Padgett in the matter of the length of serials
November was the second issue of the present type of Argosy that is to say all fiction
Seattle Washington
have just finished reading FourForty at the Fort Penn by Perley Poore Sheehan in the March number of The Argosy and must say think it is crackerjack
have read number of novels by the same author including The Star of Adventure and Phyllis ot Fountain Square all good every one but THE ARGOSY
FourForty at the Fort Penn beats them all
call it his masterpiece
was thinking few days ago while reading The Argosy how long it had been since first began to read it
My mind went back good many years when was sailor on the Atlantic coast
think it was in the summer of that first saw and read the little weekly called the Golden Argosy and think it was in November that read The Argosy as monthly
was in Portland Maine at the time and some sailor brought it aboard my ship along with other reading matter
Sailors as rule are very fond of reading
read it then and have continued to read it ever since and it grows better all the time
like your complete novels very well but my preference is for long serial story the longer it is the better it suits me
enjoy reading the LogBook
The different opinions given by the various readers are very interesting
read the letters of the LogBook first of all then the continued stories next the complete novel winding up with the short stories
For the small sum of ten cents you are certainly giving your army of readers great treat in publishing magazine up to the standard of highpriced publications
read all kinds of magazines also fiction from the public library but get more satisfaction out of copy of The Argosy than from any of them
WANTS NO SERIALS AT ALL Now for the man who dislikes serials but in this case he has nullified his objection by sub scribing so that there is no danger of his miss ing number
He makes The Argosy bit older than it is by harking back to the seventies
The first number was dated December
The volumes were at that time yearly ones
With the increased number of pages they were shifted to halfyearly and when still more pages were added to each monthly issue to three year as at present in order to obviate books too bulky for easy handling
Etna Wyoming
Please find enclosed two dollars for which please renew my subscription for one year to The Arcosy and also please send the Railroad Mans Magazine
like both of these magazines
The only objection can find to The Argosy is too many serials
would be better pleased if there were no serials at all for if you miss copy especially if it is in the completion of story it is very annoying and out in this wild country seventy miles or more from railroad you cant step over to newsstand and buy your missing copy
How any one can like serials better than complete novels cant imagine as cant remember what serial is about from one month to the next
But in my estimation The Argosy is the best fiction magazine pub lished
have taken it now about ten years believe and have read stray copies of it since it was the Golden Argosy back in the seventies in old Missouri
have never subscribed to the Railroad Mans Magazine but have read good many stray copies of it
Edward Lever
NEWS IN NUTSHELL Many thanks to my Georgia friend for telling so much in so few words
You will note that he mentions what he considered the best novels his favorite short stories and the authors that have appealed to him the most strongly
These are expressions of opinion very helpful to an editor and matter which am sure you all enjoy reading in the way of comparing with your own ideas
Bellton Georgia
Would you allow fellows letter to be printed in the LogBook
have no kicks on The Argosy at all
like all your stories
think In the Blue Limousine Southwest of the Law The Green Lamp The Trap Line Runners The Border of Blades and The Great White Wastes in the April issue best
But in fact like them all
My favorite short stories that have appeared in The Argosy lately are And She Took Me In and Ranch Secret My favorite authors are Lenivers Carew Seward Hopkins Norcross Forbes Rex Parson Katharine Eggleston George Cain and BedfordJones
am not much on the serials
will not miss copy of The Argosy as long as it is as good as it is now
Always on the good side of The Argosy remain James Quillian
THE MATTER OF SHORT STORIES Tell me readers how many of you hail with joy the sight of the contents page when it pro claims that there are tfin short stories in the number in place say of five or six
That means of course that either the complete novel is shorter or that there are not such long in stalments of the serials
The more short stories of course the more variety but how many of you stop to think about this wonder
To comply with Mr Torreys suggestion would limit the shorts very decidedly
Housatonic Massachusetts
Enclosed please find check for years sub scription to The Argosy which kindly mail to my address beginning with the April number
Heretofore have bought it from the news stands but it comes at irregular dates and thought would try years subscription and see if it did not come on the date expected
have not missed copy in fifteen or eighteen years and find no other magazine that anywhere near interests me as does the good old Argosy
hope to read it for many more years
must say however that am greatly disappointed to have you go back to the serials
Before you cut them out did not realize what an im provement it could be but after having every number complete enjoyed the reading so much more that now am holding everything back THE LOGBOOK
until it is completed and it sometimes makes tiresome waiting
Hoping you may some time cut them down to at the most two or three part stories am ever and sincerely yours VV
MAKING ARGOSY READERS Fresh light on the manner in which Argosy readers are made
In view of what he says suppose must count Mr Edgerly as voting for fewer short stories
Blue Mound Kansas
neighbor who was moving away gave me several Argosys for the latter months of the year
read them and became perma nent reader with the January number of and during these nearly seventeen years have never missed number nor story and in all these years have never found poor story in The Argosy except the Hawkins stuff
That was certainly rotten
think that the booklength stories are infinitely better than the short ones and wish there were more of them
save the magazines until have all of serial story then read it as would book in one or two evenings
That way is far more satisfactory to me
take seven other magazines but none fills the place that The Argosy does for good clean interesting fiction
find very many interesting letters in the LogBook and you may publish this if you wish
THE BEST STORY Heres an early response to my request in the April Log for readers to tell me what they con sidered the best story they had read in The Argosy
The Land of the Central Sun by Park Winthrop is not out in book form
Quincy Illinois
just purchased The Argosy for April and turned to the back pages to the LogBook as have always done since the LogBook has been printed
saw letter from
telling of the best short story in The Argosy
The best story ever read in The Argosy was serial which began in the July number of
It was The Land of the Central Sun and that story has kept me buying The Argosy every month since and do not intend to miss one as long as live and know that my son and daughter will do likewise
know full well my old friend
will want to know the best short story have read in The Argosy
Now my kind friend
have no choice
They are all good good good
Will you please let me know if The Land of the Central Sun is published in book form and where can pur chase it
RANCH SECRET WINS FOR HIM This is fine having my readers answer so promptly the questions ask
Here is another reply to my desire to know the best short story
Mr Peck will be delighted to hear that the complete novel for August will be by Seward Hopkins
Lake Providence Louisiana
am regular bookworm and have been regular reader of The Argosy ever since it was first published
have always thought that the complete novels and serials were the best as it gives the author chance to deepen the plot and explain it in more satisfactory manner
This dont prevent me from reading and en joying the short stories
In your April number you ask what is the best short story
In my opinion Ranch Secret by Seward Hop kins is about the best ever read
If it had been written as serial it could have filled one hundred pages or more of interesting read ing and made the author famous
hope yet to read long story by the writer
read nearly all the best magazines but like The Argosy best of all
WEST AND NORTH TO THE FORE Heres case of off again on again with The Argosy
Possibly can arrange for serial of England in the long ago
new story of the North is now under way and have in stock fresh one by Raymond Spears
Canterbury Connecticut
was reading The Argosy in the year think when the magazine was bound in yel low covers but the stories did not suit me
In my opinion they all seemed to be in the same vein so did not buy it long
After year or so my brother brought home copy that he got from neighbor
The complete novel was entitled Waters of Strife by BedfordJones and all of the stories were good and have not missed copy since
In the same issue was serial story of England

have no fault to find with The Argosy
Better than ever at ten cents per copy
Edgar Parkhurst
FINE THREE MONTHS SCORE The Argosy is certainly making great record with its novels
The January Southwest of the Law set the ball rolling with perfect chorus of praise
February followed hard on its heels with an avalanche of good things said about The Blue Limousine and now Four Forty at the Fort Penn in March is scoring heavily
The author of The Man With the Chest was Rath
Hazelwood Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
have been reader of The Argosy for number of vears
and want to sav it is the hest THE ARGOSY
magazine have read
Just finished Four Forty at the Fort Penn by Perley Poore Sheehan
It was purely great
think the author means the Fort Pitt Hotel instead of Fort Penn
It is opposite Pennsylvania Station
The first copy of The Argosy read was The Man With the Chest forget the authors name but it surely was great tale
Hoping this passes the wastebasket remain Arthur Mason
WHAT SETTLED THE BUSINESS
sprained ankle set this man to reading The Argosy
How about somebody having been won to it by seeing an attractive coverpicture on the newsstand
Are there any such
pause for reply
Southworth Washington
Enclosed you will find one dollar for years subscription to The Argosy
You wanted to knowhow the readers got acquainted with the magazine
In August was laid up with sprained ankle
friend loaned me two Arcosys and that settled the business
Have never missed single number since
Have paid from ten to twenty cents for it and would gladly pay the twenty cents again
enjoy every one of your booklength novels also the serials
Just finished FourForty at the Fort Penn It certainly is grand
Also just finished the serial The Motive This to my mind is the best have read for long time
The Blue Limou sine was crackerjack
Have always bought at the newsstands but as have now to go ten miles to get it will subscribe
If this goes in the LogBook please use only initials
Have no choice of your authors
They are all good
Long live The Argosy the best fiction magazine that is printed today
NO TEST NEEDED The letter below is another of the sort am glad to get as it gives me some illuminating ideas of the readers tastes and preferences
Lease and other Jackson fans will be glad to know that Fred has come back
have two long stories from his typewriter now in the safe awaiting publication
Seattle Washington
have been reading The Argosy for so long that have lost track of the exact date of the first magazine though well remember the story that started me as steady reader
found an old Argosy in cabin in Lewistown Montana and started reading it
The story was The King of Arcadia do not remember the authors name but from that time till now have not missed single copy
have no kick on any of the stories though some are better than others
The Desert Crucible The Trap Line Runners Gold Grabbers Waters of Strife all three of the John Solomon stories and The Clutch of Siberia October are to my notion the best stories that you have published
Of the authors like BedfordJones Zane Grey Perley Poore Shee han William Wallace Cook Stephen Brandish and Fred Jackson but best of all Zane Grey
He knows his West as few authors know it
am not writing this as test to see if the LogBook is fake or not as had one letter printed some three or four years ago and am sure that if mine was printed the others are from readers of your wonderful magazine
delighted reader Lease
PATRIOTIC NOTE am very glad to give space to the follow ing eulogy on the patriotic little tale that closed our April number
It appeared at timely date and assure Mrs that deeply appre ciate her good words for it
Washington District of Columbia
Much as like The Argosy the Log is to me the most interesting but your last number April contains gem by Kenneth Rossiter What He Could Do and is worthy of the vignette of the old soldier saving the flag from desecration by the vandals who would destroy it picture which should be carried by every patriotic man in his pocket and be in the scrap book of every woman who loves the flag and the nation
The dear old veteran saves the flag under which he had the honor to fight in the perils of the dear old soldier going through life so patient and silent and willing again to give his life for his country
The story is pretty one and well told by the author
never read one better and congratulate him on its success
It is not necessary to publish my name
LOGBOOK JOTTINGS Danella Paine Queen Nevada and Albin Lotus Illinois in sending yearly sub scriptions both use exactly the same phrase to the effect that they do not want to miss num ber
The latter has taken the magazine for twelve years and the former since old enough to read
Ross Gualala California also subscribing explains that he is forty miles from the nearest railroad and as he cannot get along without The Argosy sends the money in ad vance
Acknowledgment is made to Jim Port Norfolk Virginia for his very flattering tribute in verse
Aleshire Craig Colo rado thinks The Argosy the best magazine in the world but it is hard to Ht at Craig without missing some of the numbers so he subscribes
Clarence Race Denver Colorado found FourForty at the Fort Penn as interesting and exciting as horserace
New York City is informed that we are constantly looking for fiction
There is always room in The Arcosy for the new writer who has good story to tell and knows how to start it off with punch in the very first sentence

Jimmy dragged him into tins middle of lha road and left him

There were moments when Jimmy could think very fast indeed
His man had not counted on that Then Jimmy went alraiit np to he door of thesiaistor dark house and nuig be bell
TTra door he noticed was beautiful Joor

The police whistle had Leiai heard
Doors openM
Timmy Inrkod in sliadow by tho buautiful door and waited

Nothing moved iu the strovl

Jimmy Toarhed post him and gently puilod the dnnr to witba out actually intebing iL Then he dragged Ualdy two or three paces up thfl itrrel and into deep and dark doorway

He could not forget that dyiiie man who crawled to his miignlew door and he luid no lyn lathy at all for Hatily

Ho left Baldy ia the street to be pickeil up by the police and tJius provide tluio with dual mystery and he gently closed the door luid stood alone in tho dim light of the rather intpoiing and wide entrance passageway

He appears to bo an urdiiiiiry British subject snil os such is entitled to the fail cnnsidenitian of the law
Hr has not dune aiiliiog criminoJ
and os matter of fact has alrsadj performed several note worthy actions iu public welfare since arriving in England
Fur the mujuent therefore we ran only adrisa our listcnera iu Uertfurdsliire to keep on tlie lorjkont for any sign of the Ternu
We suggesl
liwt tliey cndotfVQOP fo keep cut of his way
Wo shall lifOrKlrast at intervals of pinrtrr of nn hour unlit we know the Governments decision
Tho Terror frowned
Should he continue to lislonin It might bo an hour nr so before any further news came through
Tiieyl probably make an attempt to rumid me up lio thought Theyll pro hatily try tu have me confined somewhere
Well if theT cemo to tank me sliall bo only too ready to meet and talk to Hipm

For the inoment dont think Hn withdrew Uis nviii
As fte did so tfiere camo noali from iiuidt Mie bar pnzlour
To tho Terror of course it was only the Caiatest of eouiidsnud it fnilPtl to penolruto his cOniciotvUieiW
limiite his full heiglit
he Jerked the lions elmin And continued onwards
Hat ihst enuh in the barnarluur of the inn had been paused by the falUug of an oil lamp which had stccil alongside the iunler
It souulied ou tu the flur nml stream of oil poured in the dtrooiion of the firqrlacc where bright fire was buiuiiig
Hvrii ns the Terror left the village so did tho oil catch firo
and sonn ihn bar puilour was Mazing mfeniu There was nobody in the xiikgc to raise the alum
The um Via nn old building iuid it oncient hcaras burned fiercely
When he was some ten miles away the Tenor turned his head and looked hock
In the distance ho saw dense trail of smoke Ho fruwned
Somexthere Iwhind him was tre mmduus fire
He shook bu head
Wialuver it wa

At Bawyars Circus very few men Ixad gono Iu slerp after the Terrors departure

MoneyMaking Opportunity for Men of Character EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE FOR An Invention Expected to Replace MultiMillionDollar Industry Costly Work Formerly Sent Out by Business Men Now Done by Themselves at Fraction of the Expense This is call for men everywhere to handle exclusive agency for one of the most Unique business Inventions of the day
Forty years ago the horse and buggy business was supremetoday almost extinct
Twenty years ago the phonograph industry ran into many millionstoday practically relic
Only comparatively few foresighted men saw the fortunes ahead In the automobile and the radio
Yet irresistible waves of public buying swept these men to fortune and sent the buggy and the phonograph into the discard
So are great successes made by men able to detect the shift in public favor from one industry to another
iNW another change is taking place
An old established industryan integral and important part of the nations structurein which millions of dollars change hands every yearis tn thousands of cases being replaced by truly astonishin si mple inven tion which does the work bettermore reliablyAND AT COST OFTEN AS LOW AS OF WHAT IS ORDINARILY PAID
It has not required very long for men who have taken over the rights to this valuable invention to do remarkable business and show earnings which these times arc almost unheard of for the average man
EARNINGS One man in California earned over per month for three monthsclose to in days time
Another writes from Delaware Since have been operating just little less than month of actual selling and not the full day at that because have been getting organized and had to spend at least half the day in the office counting what have sold outright and on trial have made just little in excess of one thousand dollars profit for one month
Connecticut man writes he has made in single days time
Texas man nets over in less than weeks time
Space does not per mit mentioning here more than these few random cases
How ever they arc sufficient to indicate that the worthwhile future in this business is coupled with immediate earnings for the right kind of man
One man with us has already made over thousand sales on which his earnings ran from to per sale and more
great deal of this business was repeat business
Yet he had never done anything like this before coming with us
That is the kind of opportunity this business offers
The fact that this business has attracted to it such business men as former bankers executives of businesses men who demand only the highest type of opportunity and incomegives fairly good picture of the kind of business this is
Our door is open however to the young man looking for the right field inwhichto make his start and develophis future
Not aGadget Not KnickKnack but valuable proved device which has been sold successfully by busi ness novices as well as seasoned veterans
Make no mistakethis is no noveltyno flimsy creatioo which the inventor hopes to put on the market
You probably have seen nothing hke it yetperhaps never dreamed of the existence of such deviceyet it has already been used by corporations of outstanding prominenceby dealers of great corporationsby their branchesby doc tors newspapers publishersschoolshospitals etc etc and by thousands of small business men
You dont have to convince man that he should use an electric bulb to light his office instead of gas lamp
Nor do you have to sell the same business man the idea that some day he may need something like this invention
The need is already there the money is usually being spent right at that very moment and the desirability of saving the greatest part of this expense is obvious immediately
Some of the Savings You Can Show Too wIk into an office and put down before poor prospect letter from sales organization showing that they did work in their own office for which formerly could have cost them over
building supply corporation pays our man whereas the bill could nave been for
An automobile dealer pays our representative whereas the expense could have been over
department tore has expense of possible cost if done outside the business being well over
And so on
We could not possibly list all cases here
These are just few of the many actual cases which we place in your hands to work with
Practically every line of business and every section of the country is represented by these field reports which hammer across dazzling convincing moneysaving opportunities which hardly any business man can fail to understand
Profits Typical of the Young Growing Industry Going into this business is not like selling something offered in every grocery drug or department store
For instance when you take order can be your share
On worth of business your share can be
The very least you get as your part of every dollars worth of business you do is centson ten dollars worth on hundred dollars worth in other words mo thirds of every order you get is yours
Not only on the first orderbut on repeat orders and you have the opportunity of earning an even larger percentage
This Business Has Nothing to Do With House to House Canvassing Nor do you have to know anything about highpressure selling
Selling is unnecessary in the ordinary sense of the word
Instead of hammering away at the customer and trying to force sale you make dignified businesslike call leave the installationwhatever size the customer says he will acceptat our risk let the customer sell himself after the device is in and working
This does away with the need for pressure on the cus tomerit eliminates the handicap of trying to get the money before the customer has really convinced himself
You simply tdl what you offer showing proof of success in that customers particular line of business
Then leave the invention without dollar down
It starts working at once
In few short days the installa tion should actually produce enough cash money to pay for the deal yvith profits above the investment coming in at the same time
You then call back collect your money
Nothing is so convincing as our offer to let results speak for themselves without risk to the customer While others fail to get even hearing our men are making sales running into the hundreds
They have received the atten tion of the largest firms in the country and sold to the smallest businesses by the thousands
No Money Need Be Risked in trying this business out

Lacey sat behind the wheel driving with unconscious skill his steelgrey eyes filled with strangely ruminative light his black fedora hat pushed back over the queerly white expanse of his forehead so that the crisp curling brickred hair which clung tightly to his skull was visible
Red Lacey Goes Berserk When Terror Path of Courageous Hardboiled Sleuth
the sap broke teeth and mouth MASQUERADE Both sides of the street were lined with pushcarts
There were car tracks in the center of the street and multitude of trucks and drays pounded and jounced over the cobble stone paving
The pushcarts were lined in solid mass
Piled on them was an assortment of merchandise appalling and profuse piled up jumbled masses of merchandise which fat perspiring women pawed over lackadaisically watched by sleepyeyed almost inert merchants who seemed completely disinterested in salesmanship or customer interest
Fruits and vegetables meats gar ments hardware notions odds and ends of bolts of cloth haberdashery cart after cart pushed into position indiscriminately
And the hot sun beat down into the narrow canyon of Fallon Street and the cluttered pave ments and cobblestones gave off shimmering heat eddies until the space between the ancient brick buildings became like the interior of crematory
Draymen and truck drivers cursed lethargically
Trolley motormen clanged bells halfheartedly
Even Routs His Old Home Stamping Grounds
POPULAR DETECTIVE the children playing in the street at peril of life and limb seemed to run and to yell in slow motion
The win dows of the tenements were fes tooned with pillows and on the pil lows ladies of the neighborhood leaned on meaty elbowsleaned with fine disregard for the ran dom display of feminine anatomy which should have been reserved for the eyes of more or less fond hus bandsleaned and conversed hap hazardly as if no zest remained in neighborhood gossip
Strange smells hot foreign im pregnated the heat
Laceys eyes looked at the traffic of Fallon Street looked at the faces the skullcaps the beards the black vestments the tired draggedout women the whitefaced children the straining horses and the sizzling trucks
ESIDES him surrounded by an aura of almost regal splendor rode Willie Quirk
Willies uplifted nose was distinctly sniffing at Fallon Street odors
His freckled impish face was drawn up into grimace of impatience
Jeez what joint complained Willie
How come you didnt cut over to LaFayette Street and get decent break goin uptown The cabriolet was stopped by the immovable traffic ahead
Laceys head turned his eyes looked at Willie Quirk
The queer rapt look was still in the steelgrey depths
Every now and then Willie deliberately drive through here he said strangely
It kind of helps guy to keep things straight in his mind
It kind of keeps his sense of values in proportion dont get it groaned Willie
Its hotter than the inside of rhumba dancers instep Look Willie said Lacey with nod toward the teeming sidewalks
See those pushcarts
See those stores
See those people Sure grunted Willie
So what Those people are the backbone of New York City remarked Lacey in the same strange voice
And people like them are the backbone of the whole United States of Amer ica Willie Quirk merely stared at Laceys face
There was little frown of worry and perplexity on his forehead
He looked at Laceys face anxiously as if to assure himself that his beloved Chief was physi cally and mentally fit and in no dan ger of heat prostration
He nodded vaguely
You said it Chief See those little metal signs on those pushcarts Willie Them peddlers licenses Yeah
Know what that means Sure they go down to City Hall and put up couple of bucks and get one of them tin signs they tack it on the cart and theyre in business More than that smiled Lacey
Those little tin signs represent taxes paid
Thousands of dollars gor ing into the treasury of the City of New York and to the Government
Those stores there on both sides of the street
Every one of them pays license and taxes on top of that
Taxes mean money
Taxes build big beautiful buildings like the new court buildings we just passed
Taxes the dollars sweatcovered grimy dollars from Fallon Street and other streets like it Well gosh everybody pays taxes dont they asked Willie
Why didnt that Man with the Whiskers make me pay out on that dough we made
Aint taxpayer Its little different with these people Willie said Lacey in the same almost sombre tone
They get so little back for their money
guess proportionately they pay more taxes than anybody else in the country
They pay em more hon estly
You see they cant cheat
They dont make enough to hire fast talking slippery lawyers to chisel the Government and the city
They cant cover up
They just pay what theyre told to pay and no questions asked
And the damned shame of it is that lot of the money they pay goes uptown to make Central Park sections beautifulso that the tax DEATH MASQUERADE chiselers can have lovely places to walk their dogs
lot of the sweat stained money that comes out of Fallon Street goes uptown Laceys eyes closed for minute
Perhaps the glare of the sun had something to do with it
His voice became distant
Squalor and magnificence side by side
Maybe upstairs in one of those tenement rooms little kid is stand ing with fiddle under his chin
little kid who never had quite enough to eat
And the bow is going back and forth across the strings and the little kid doesnt even feel the heat
And maybe someday that little kid will stand up in front of boiledshirted audience in Carnegie Hall and hell be another Elman or Heifetz
And maybe in another room kid is sitting in front of pianoa piano
Maybe an old man is going around with holes in his shoes and mother is not going to doctor about that pain in her side to get that piano
And his fingers are push ing down those keys and maybe another Gershwin will come out of that boy
Or another kid is standing up on the roof looking down on this street dreamy eyed drinking it in and another Fannie Hurst is being born Whatfan dancers too asked Willie
Fannie Hurst is writer Willie grinned Lacey suddenly
Oh scuse me
guess the first name kind of threw me off
Sure Fallon Street has something Park Avenue never will have said Lacey
Fallon Street has its dreamsit sleeps with the dreams
It forgets the heat and the smells and the clamor and the gongs
roundeyed people shuffling in here from other countriesbringing with them nothing but dreams
Exploited gouged victimizedstill they cling to the dreams
Dreams are life down here guess thats why like to drive through Fallon Street
Park Avenue has no dreams
Park Avenue hasnt feeling enough to dream isnt close enough to life Gee Chief said Willie you got relatives down here See that corner asked Lacey with faint white smile
Sure Fallon and Orchid
Why My grandfather was born right around that corner and lived there to the last day of his life Your grandfather marveled Willie
Any reason why shouldnt have grandfather
Most people have Nono
Only Gee its funny hearin you talk about grand father
Somehow guy gets the idea that you was always here that you were born grownup
Get it
Just kinda happened along just as you are Lacey grinned
HE traffic started its slow move eastward
The tired horses strained at traces
The ironrimmed wheels rolled and crunched on the cobblestones
The truck engines chugged raced backfired
The trol ley bells clanged querulously
The heat beat down soaked into bodies
And over the grinding pound of the traffic there was sudden shriek ing voice
single voice uplifted in hideous throatstraining scream
The sound ripped through the ordi nary sounds of the street like knife stabbing to the heart
The horses suddenly stopped
The truck engines were stilled
silence gripped Fallon Street
silence which seemed made up of white deadeyed faces staring to ward the source of the scream
girl stood in front of shop
Her hands were beating her breast
Long black hair seemingly torn vio lently out of place fell down over her shoulders
Her eyes were wide and staring
She stood stark in the doorway of the store and screamed
Over and over
In breath Lacey was on the side walk
The door of the cabriolet was still open
The car stood in the cen ter of the stalled traffic
He glanced once at the girls face
She was beautiful almost Oriental
She wore POPULAR DETECTIVE onepiece dress
The dress was ripped at the throat exposing one full beautifully rounded breast
Her eyes were wild with fearand new born grief
Lacey grabbed her by an arm whirled her around
Whats the matter with you he barked at her harshly
The scream died out of her throat
She whimpered little
Her face was ashen
Her throat moved spas modically
She seemed unable to speak
She turned her head her eyes stared into the shadows of the store
Lacey looked inside the door
There was crumpled something on the floor close to the counter
heavily veined white hand outflung inertly the wrist disappearing into rusty black alpaca coat
Lacey was inside the store in three strides
He banged the door after him
He dragged the girl with him
The thing on the floor was man an old man
An old man with white beard
skullcap was pushed down over the old mans eyes
The angle was ribald
He lay quietly half on his back on his side
There was little trickle of blood running from the corner of his mouth
His eyes were closed
There was an ugly bruise on the parchmentlike flesh covering his jaw
Excepting for that he might have been asleep overweary asleep on the floor of his store
Lacey picked up the hand
The hand was warm but soft and inert
He felt for pulse
There was no pulse
The old man was dead
The girl stood quiet now looking down
Outside faces pressed against glass of the window and door
Lacey looked over his shoulder
He got to his feet snatched open the door spoke angrily
You people scram he told the crowd
The old man faintedheat nothing serious
Scram now or There was authority in his voice
The authority these people knew
They looked at his face
There was authority there too
They drifted away talking to themselves look ing back
Lacey strode through the already impatient traffic
Drive the bus in front of the store he told Willie Quirk
The hell with these guys in the trucks and things
Put it up on the sidewalk if you have toand stay with it
Ill be in that little store CHAPTER II Protective Union ACEY went back to the store entered closed the door after him
He stood facing the girl
Her face was quiet but still ashen like mask
Her hands were clenched into hard fists
Hesdead she asked quietly al most resignedly
Lacey nodded
Hes dead he said
Something rushed up into his throat at the look which came into the girls eyes
Something that seemed to strangle him
What happened he asked huskily
They came back Her voice spoke out of semistupor
They said theyd come back and hed have to pay
He didnt have the money sothey did that to him
They hit hima big manheavy with gold tooth
He hit him in the face cursed at him Wait minute said Lacey
What men
What money did they want dont know said the girl
only know they came in the store maybe ten days ago
They said they were forming societyunion
Yes protective union they called it
All the merchants were joining to keep from being robbed and it would cost Papa twenty dollars week to belong Well grated Lacey sudden chill in his voice
Where would he get twenty dollars week to join union
And nobody had ever robbed him or anything in ten years in DEATH MASQUERADE business right here
So why should he join union And they told him hed join or else is that it growled Lacey
He had to pay the twenty bucks week whether he wanted to or not She nodded
How did you know asked her dead voice
There are lot of unions like that said Lacey grimly
Well he didnt pay
So So the two men said theyd come back and he better have the money
So they came back today and he tried to tell them that he didnt want to join the union couldnt
And then one of the menthe big one with the gold tooth took some thing black out of his pocket and hit Papa across the mouth and laughed and said next time the price would be fifty dollars week And they went out still laugh ing eh Icy glints were swimming in Laceys eyes
Papa stood there staring at them as ifhe couldnt feel any thing
tried to keep them from hitting Papa
They hit me tore my dress
When they went out the door Papahe came around the end of the counter and suddenly he fell down
couldnt make him hear or open his eyesor anything There was sign on the window
The letters were reversed
Lacey read the sign
SAMUEL GOLDEN Notions He looked away from the window at the pitiful little stock within the store
At the impeccably neat array of shelves and counters
And the clean scrubbed floor and then at the white face with the trickle of blood oozing from the corner of the mouth
Hes Samuel Golden asked Lacey as if for something to say to break the terrible silence and the hoarse breathing of the girl
She nodded
Samuel Goldenmy my Father
My name is Rosa Rosa Golden Suddenly she fell her knees buckled under her weight
She fell across the black alpaca coat and the black trousers
Her face buried itself in the white beard
Agony flooded up out of her soul shook her body
Lacey stood looking down at her for moment
Then he lifted her face
Ive got to talk to you for mo mentIm sorry he said
Why she moaned
Why should they do this to him
All he ever did was be kind to everybody
Every day of his life he worked
Every day he sat here and workedand dreameda bigger store maybe
He was good manhis voiceso gentlehis eyeslike childs Dont let anyone in here said Lacey
Nobody in here
And dont talk to anyone or go out of that door until come back Her eyes merely looked at him without seeing
He turned his own eyes swirling almost devilish
He closed the front door of the store after him
The kids were playing in the street
Tha endless procession of trucks and drays went by
Heat eddies steamed up from the cement and pushcarts and cobblestones
He saw public telephone sign on corner store
He went in closed the door of the booth after him called Police Headquarters
Gimme Johnson of the Homicide Squad he barked at the police oper ator
After moment he was talking to Johnson
little storekeeper named Golden was killed couple of minutes ago by couple of thugs
Samuel Golden four eightysix Fal lon Street

Ill talk to you after you get here
Ive got an idea
Remember nothing that looks like the police and no sirens or so help me Ill never give you an other break as long as live He went back to the store
He picked Samuel Golden up in his arms carried him into back room put his body on worn sofa
Ten minutes later Johnson came POPULAR DETECTIVE IB in
Lacey talked to him in voice vibrant with nervous energy
Once he broke off to shoot question at the griefstricken girl
Youd know these two men again if you saw them Her eyes blazed
Yes she said simply
Youd like to keep them from do ing the same thing they did to your father to some other girls father She shuddered covered her face with her hands
Yes oh yes she moaned
Dont be afraid said Lacey kindly
This is Detectiveinspector Johnson of Headquarters
My name is LaceyRed Lacey
Were going to try to punish the men who did this
We may want you to help little
Those were bad men
Unless we catch them they will go on do ing things like this
If you dont help us some other girl may lose her father as you lost yours The flame in her black eyes was suddenly dazzling
It seemed to transfigure her whole being
She stood very straight and very white
Her voice shook with emotional un dercurrents
am willing to do anything she said
Johnson looked at Lacey and nodded
think youve got something there Sherlock he admitted
Ill play ball with you
Play it out see where it gets you
Only cut me in when it gets hot and if you need help holler What help will need trapping couple of rats asked Lacey
ONE saw the dead Samuel Golden taken out of the little store in which he had been buried ten years of his life with his dreams and ambitions
Johnson took care of that
litter crew came in the early morning through the alley behind the store came silently departed the same way bearing the old man be tween them
No one knew that Samuel Golden was gone
No one knew he was dead
Because Red Lacey labored for an hour before mirror studying the dead face of the old man work ing and molding his own features with infinite care into perfect re semblance
man from Headquarters arrived in taxi
An expert on makeup he studied the dead face and head
He departed
An hour after his going messenger boy delivered package to the little store
The messenger boy was Willie Quirk in uniform
The package contained wig the exact duplicate of Samuel Goldens hair and pigment of the proper shading for makeup
Laceys crisp red hair disappeared under the wig
So Samuel Golden lay still on the sofa and Red Lacey sat at table and copied him feature for feature line for line
Even to the little stoop between Samuel Goldens shoulders and the wart over his right eyebrow
And while he worked the girl Rosa watched her eyes filled with an almost hypnotic horrorwatched her father made to live again in the person of Red Lacey
Watched as if it might have been terrible nightmare
Watched in silence
When Lacey stood up he had Sam uel Goldens beard fastened to his own face with spirit gum
The beard masked the young grim lines of his mouth
He wore the black alpaca coat and the worn black trousers and the watchchain and the skull cap
The girl put her hand over her mouth held her breath
Lacey kept talking to her all the time he manufactured himself into replica of the dead storekeeper
You must believe it in your heart he told her
You must not think of your father as being dead killed
You must not give sign that anything has happened in this store that anything is changed
You must go about your daily affairs just as you did until today
You must treat me exactly as you treated your father She nodded
Laceys voice went on talking
What did you do usually Her voice swam through layers of weary numbness in her brain
DEATH MASQUERADE Imade my Fathers meals and took care of his house
And sang Sang said Lacey casually touching an eye shadow with pencil
What did you sing Folk songs things he loved Youll have to sing just as you did whenbefore todaysing the same way Her throat trembled
He worked so hard so that could sing
He would sit there looking at my face when sang to him and sometimes the neighbors would come in and listen and he would be so proud
He used to say Someday Rosa you will sing for the world Her voice broke suddenly
She was looking at his face
Sing now said Lacey
Her eyes closed
Sing she said hollowly
Sing Her voice went up ended in little shrill screaming pitch
Youve got to be trouper Rosa he said kindly
Youve got to sing
Youve got to tell yourself that youre in the wings and its your cue to go on and youve got to sing There was silence
Her hands were fists again her body rigid
Very well she said in whisper
Ill sing Deadwhite face of Samuel Golden on the sofa
Ghost of Samuel Golden in the person of Red Lacey
Stark figure of the girl half covered by the shadows of the room
Only her eyes alive in her face and her mouth opened and sounds came out
Low sobbing throbbing sounds in deep contralto voice
The sound filled the room rose and fell
Elieli Her eyes looking at her fathers face
The grief and anguish in her heart rushing into her voice
Her hands lifting up and up
Lacey sat there looking at her spellbound
She was suddenly thing of exquisite beauty the living figure of
Tragedy singing threnody
Tragedy hands uplifted to the heavens
Her voice died away crooning minor tone
She sank down on the floor covered her face with her hands
Lacey said in husky whisper God what voice Then the men came in the door and carried out Samuel Golden
Car ried him away in the darkness
CHAPTER III East Side Hero ED LACEY sat be hind the counter of Samuel Goldens no tion store
The black skullcap was on his head
The half light touched him
The girl Rosa moved about through the store
Now and then she looked at Laceys face at the bread and the cap and the black alpaca coat and strange halffrightened half unbelieving light filled her eyes
It had been like this for four days
Lacey playing the part of Samuel Golden
Never leaving the store
Rosa preparing his meals acting her part in the grim little drama
Waiting for the men to come back
The men who had crashed black jack off the jaw of Samuel Golden killed him
One manwith gold tooth
Hours like slow moving eternities
Hours filled with suspense with tin gling nerves
Hours waiting watch ing that front door
Under the counter close to Laceys hand was submachinegun and automatic
When customers came into the store he carried out the part of Samuel Golden
His stooped form stood erect
He smiled under his beard
And the girl was thorough bred
She sensed everything
She came running into the store to greet neighbor customers
She talked to them
She laughed
She sang
And she watched the front door
Traffic moved endlessly through Fallon Street
The rumble of heavy wheels shook the building
The heat beat down mercilessly
Across the POPULAR DETECTIVE street Willie Quirk lounged in his uniform
Now and then he went into store now and then he went from one end of the block to the other
There was police whistle in his pocket
He had explicit directions on how and when to use that whistle
He played his part so well he nearly effaced himself
Certainly no one gave him second look
And then on the afternoon of the fourth day the girl Rosa was in the back of the store singing
Sing ing one of those deeptoned croon ing things that made the heart liquid and her voice broke jaggedly in the middle of strain
She stood staring at the door
The little bell over the door had jangled
The men had entered
Lacey hardly turned his head
He looked at the girls face
It was enough
He knew the visitors he awaited had arrived
He got out of his seat slowly his hands resting on the counter
MAN in white suit panama hat orchid silk shirt white sport shoes and diamond ring bellied up to the counter
Hi Sam he said
There was wicked glint in his eyes
The grin grew broader as he looked at the ugly purple bruise Lacey had dupli cated on his own face
Hows the jaw he asked
It didnt bust
Cripes for an old guy you can take it The second man was ratfaced little punk with pinpoint irises and twitching hands
He mirrored the grin on the face of his companion
Now and then he glanced through the window at the street
He was restless almost itching
He was overdressed
His face was sallow unhealthylooking
The mark of the drug addict was on him
Laceys voice shook little
What do you want he said in an old mans tones
The heavier of the two laughed loudly and poked the hophead in the ribs with an elbow
What do we want he mocked
How do you like that
He dont krnv what we want He whirled suddenly stuck his face close to Laceys
Listen you punk he snarled
Were through playin with you get it
From now on things are going to get toughbeginning right now
We figured that maybe that little rap on the teeth with sap would wake you up to the fact that we aint playing bean bag
You get the dough on the line and be glad youre getting off at bargain rates
Twenty bucks week is the price
And come up with itbe wisesave yourself grief Twenty dollars moaned Lacey in quavering voice
Where should get twenty dollars
dont make twenty dollars hardly in week
Be sides dont want to belong to no Business Mans Protective Associa tion or whatever it is
dont need it positively
Nothing is happening in this store
In ten years already nothing happens His voice trailed away
You mean up to now laughed the spokesman with grating sad ism in his voice
Now look were talking business and you may as well get used to it
From now on Im the guy who will make the collections see
collect the membership fees
Sure every Friday like clockwork Ill be around
And you better be ready for me see
We dont carry no delinquent customers
We leave that job to the hurryup wagon from Bellevue
Now kick through with this weeks dues
dont want no trouble with you Laceys voice was the same stub born monotone
havent got twenty dollars
wont pay
Why dont you go away
dont want to belong
told you The man in the white linen suit shrugged and looked at his ratfaced pal
Well guess we may as well start he said meaningly
The dopehead had voice like rat
Sure he squeaked
Might as well start The man in the white suit made sudden lunge forward
His hand grabbed for the beard in front of him to pull the bearded face toward him
sap leaped out from under DEATH MASQUERADE the sleeve of his coat
sap with the loop around his wrist
This time you get it righthe grunted
And suddenly the bearded face in front of him glided out of reach
And at the same instant white shak ing hand came up from under the counter and the hand caressed automatic
Why you greasylooking louse screamed the man in the white suit
You got rod huh
little pop gun
Where in the hell do you get off being so brave all of sudden
Just for that Im going to break your arm
Put that lousy rod down was suddenly looking at the glinting lights in the eyes over the beard eyes staring out from under the white bushy brows of an old man
But they were not old mans eyes
He took step back
The girl Rosa stood unmoving her hand resting on her heart
The black sap ugly dangerous looking was still clutched in the beefy hand of the gorilla in the white suit
Be so kindly said Laceys voice imitating the voice of Samuel Golden as Rosa had described it to him to step across the storeface to the wall The ratfaced punk made sudden dive for shoulder holster
There was cracking sound like dry stick breaking
The expression on the rat like face changed stared
crim son blotch spread over the fellows shoulder ran into the texture of the sport coat he wore dripped down the sleeve
Against the wall kindly said Lacey
dont like shooting Why you sap
You cant get away with something like this cursed the man in the white suit
The mob will come in here and take this place apart
Theyll murder you Against the wallkindly urged Laceys quiet voice
The man in the white suit turned abruptly faced the wall walked for ward
He plugged me Ratface mum bled through white trembling lips
The damned old mug plugged me There was whimper in the voice
Shut your trap snarled the man in the white suit
Well take care of this guy
Hes nutsraving They stood there face to the wall hand half lifted
gentle hand ran over their per sons
The same gentle hand took belly gun from the bird in the white suit tossed it behind the counter
Just as gently it removed the ugly looking sap from around the right wrist
So youre coming every Friday to collect is it said the gentle voice
Every Friday should pay twenty good dollars to gang of chiselers like you which go around hitting honest people with blackjacks
Well wouldnt pay it Youll pay it snarled the voice of the man in the white suit
The old mans hand balanced the sap reflectively
The old mans voice said Turn around The man in the white suit turned his eyes swirling with hatred and rage
The old mans white hand suddenly went up the sap with it It cracked down
The sap hit the man in the white suit across the mouth
There was nasty grating breaking sound as the sap broke teeth and mouth
Ratface shrieked almost like woman
So my friend
How does it feel to get hit across the mouth The sap went up again
It smashed down second time
Across the bridge of the nose of the man in the white suit
There was sicken ing crunching sound
The nose col lapsed became pulp terrible looking thing
Blood spurted on the floor
Quite calmly Lacey looked at the ratfaced dopehead
He took step forward
Dont screeched Ratface
Dont The sap fell
It ruined the rat face
It fell again this time on the collarbone
There was breaking sound
So on Fridays youll come POPULAR DETECTIVE asked Laceys voice calmly
So on Fridays Ill be waitinglike this
Only it wont be Friday for you gonifs not for lot of Fridays The door opened
blue uniform filled the doorway
The cop on the beat walked into the store
He was grinning little tight white grin
The grin got little sicklooking as he looked at the two faces in front of Lacey
couple of customers Mr Mul ligan said Lacey in Samuel Goldens voice
Good customers too
little damaged maybe but good
Maybe youll take them with you Leave em to me promised Offi cer Mulligan
was just passin He winked
Itll gimme something to occupy me mind He grabbed the half dead gorillas by an arm each
The white linen suit on the bigger gorilla was blood soaked ruined
Come oh said Mulligan gruffly
Lets go for ride Maybe when you get chance to talk to these boys they could tell you something about who sent em maybe Theyll sing promised Mulligan when the boys downtown start ask in the questions He dragged the two men out with him
The girl Rosa her eyes wide stared at Laceys face the face which looked so much like the face of her own father
face with swirling grey steel green eyes crowded with the lust of battle
CROSS the street Willie Quirk almost dancing in excitement but still acting the part of the random messenger boy followed the cop and the two ruined mobsmen
It was terrible said the girls deep voice
It was cinch grinned Lacey under the beard
But its only the beginning
Theyll be back Only the little fellow was here before
The one with the thin face and funny eyes
The other man didnt recognize
Before it was man with gold tooth big man
The sidewalk outside the store was milling with excitement
Shirt sleeved men and perspiring women shoved and pushed to peer through the windows into the Golden store
Chattering voices and excited yelp ings filled the street drowned out the noises of the traffic
Men rushed into the store shook hands in emotional hysteria with the man they believed to be Samuel Golden
Women wept and screeched and looked frightened
After while horde of news paper men descended on the scene
hot story
Photo bulbs flared in side the store of Samuel Golden
Reporters shot questions
At five oclock the evening papers came through Fallon Street and Fallon Street grabbed them avidly
There was big picture of Samuel Golden on the front page of the papers and big black headline
COURAGEOUS STOREKEEPER BEATS UP GANGSTERS The caption under the picture stated Meek Storekeeper Half Kills Two Thug Extortionists
There were pictures of the two thugs
They did look half killed
Features swollen
Eyes closed to slits
Mouths crushed out of shape
Pictures taken in the precinct sta tion by grinning reporters
The running story with the photos said Believe it or not but stooped kindly eyed bearded little man sere with the years which have sprinkled snow upon his head today defended the sanctity of his home and business so well that he handed out terrific beating to two habitual tough guys The tough guys have police records as long as the beard of Samuel Golden who vanquished them
Reporters viewing the remains of the two muscle men who attempted to levy tribute on Golden found it difficult to believe that sixtyfiveyearold man slight to the point of selfeffacement modest as whisper looking belligerent as the proverbial lamb could so manhandle twice his weight in hoodlums
But there is no doubt of what occurred in the little notions store of Samuel Golden this afternoon
The two racketeers representing Mer chants Protective Association demanded tribute from Golden on threats of physical violence to his person and injury to his DEATH MASQUERADE property
The lamb swung into action took from the two hoods the artillery they carried for selfprotection and worked them over to the queens taste
Officer Mulligan cop on the beat which includes Fallon and Orchid Streets entered the store after the smoke of battle had cleared away and half carried the two semi conscious tough guys to the nearest police call box
All in all Samuel Golden wrote himself oneman Declaration of Independence from the vicious extortion racket and racketeer ing which has Fallon Street and its environs by the throat
few more fighters like Samuel Golden would make racketeering impossible
Fallon Street read the story
Fallon Street looked at the picture of Sam uel Golden on the front page and at the picture of Big Mike Cleary and Tony Piazzini whom the police had identified as the collectors for the Merchants Protective Association Fallon Street looked at Samuel Golden in the flesh and was bit dazed by it all
But Fallon Street crowded the Golden store to pay tribute to its hero modest hero who contented himself with waving gentle protests with smiling little and permitting Rosa Golden to do all the talking
CHAPTER IV TommyGun Party
HERBERT SLO CUM MOORE paced the thick Chinese rug which covered the floor of his pri vate office
He clutched late after noon edition of the NewsTelegram in his right hand
His left hand was jammed into the pockets of his tailored trousers
His thin strangely white face was cold as ice and his black eyes swirled with anger
There was suggestion of cruelty about the exquisitely molded features of Mr Moore
The nose trifle too thin and mobile suggested the wolf
The thin almost colorless mouth added to the illusion
The manner in which he wore his hair sleek drawn sharply back from his forehead added to the animal likeness
The expensive materials and tailor ing of the lounge suit he wore did nothing to dispel the illusion
Neither did the gardenia in his buttonhole
In chair set beside massive rosewood desk sat floridfaced man with gold incisor
Little blue veins ran about the mans nose
He had massive head slightly bald with greying sandy hair
His mouth was largelipped
His teeth were clamped down on cigar
He chewed at the cigar
There was worried almost furtive look in his bloodshot grey eyes
His hands were soft and white pudgy with good living and he wore threecarat diamond on the third finger of his left hand
His clothing was almost as ex pensively fashioned as Moores
He was uncomfortable
There as the suggestion of invisible perspiration about him
Now and then he squirmed in the chair as he looked at Moores thin white face
At the end of the rug Mr Moore turned suddenly faced the man with the gold tooth
His voice was cold almost plaintive but seething with carefully controlled undercurrent of fury
The trouble with you Angelo said Mr Moore to the gentleman beside the rosewood desk is that cant trust you with the execution of even petty details Aw Mr Moore protested Angelo
The guy went raving nuts
He couldnt get away with play like that again in million years
He just kind of took Mike and Tony by surprise
They didnt ex pect that Golden mug to pull rod on em
They figured after that sock on the jaw this Golden would be all softened up like everybody else and that it was just business of walking in and making the collec tion
But the little goof must have gone nuts
To pull stunt like that Look at this paper invited Moore coldly
How do you think that will react on all of ourclients
Suppose they suddenly band them selves together decide toerre sign from the Merchants Protective POPULAR DETECTIVE Association refuse to pay theirer dues Listen Boss growled Angelo
You lemme handle this business
know how to take care of that Golden punk and how to keep the rest of those babies in line
Im go ing to make an example of this Golden
When get finished with him hell payif hes able
Hell run with the dough in his hand
And so will those other suckers down there in Fallon Street
If they have any fancy ideas Ill put em to sleep quick Mr Moores eyes looked at Angelo
Im afraidreally am afraid Angelo that perhaps you are get ting littlehow do you put it soft
You dont stand prosperity well
You fail to take care of details properly
This Golden case proves it
do all the work and all the planning and take care of all the legal technicalities involved
You have only the simple execution of orders and yet you involve the or ganization in something like this
Really its inexcusable It aint nothin but an accident like said that can happen to any body insisted Angelo
said Id take care of that monkeyand will
Ill show that guy And we had Fallon Street so well organized mourned Mr Moore
Everything going so smoothly the dues are paid so promptly
Really it isa crime to permit something like this to happen He threw the crumpled paper on top of the desk
His eyes were slits
His mouth drew away from his teeth little
His teeth were white and small and sharp
His voice was still calm still cold but like the slashing of wolfs fangs
shall expect you to straighten this matter out he said
am impatient with failures
will not tolerate failures
cannot personally take care of the little details con nected with the running of this or ganization
If you dont take care of it properly or if this affair assumes serious proportions am afraid shall have to part company with you Angelo It seemed that little shudder ran up the spine of Angelo
He sat in the chair his eyes fixed on the white aristocratic face of Mr Moore
Eyes in which lurked sudden fear almost terror
Perspiration broke out in beads on his forehead
His hands opened and closed spasmodi cally
Aw gee Boss he said huskily
IJ Thats all Angelo said Mr Moore and his voice was almost kindly
You may go now
Im ex pecting you to justify my confidence in you Angelo came up out of the chair
You leave it to me he growled
Ill give that punk dose of medi cine that will make him well for the rest of his life He backed out of the office bump ing into chair on the way his hat still in his hand the light of worry and fear still in his eyes
He left Mr Herbert Slocum Moore to the contemplation of Corot landscape hanging on the wall of the exquisitely appointed office
con templation made up of frown snarling mouth and tightly clenched hands
ED LACEY still in the role of Samuel Golden sat in the dark ness of the store near the window looking out on Fallon Street
His eyes were closed his body relaxed
The grey beard fell down upon his chest
The black skullcap on his head completed picture of repose
From the living quarters behind the store the deep contralto voice of Rosa Golden crooned Russian gypsy song
Crooned it with pas sionate love for the music crooned it her throat and mouth seeming to caress each note
Now and then she moved across the doorway became silhouette against the yellow glow of light
Her body was tall and straight her head carried proudly
Now and then Lacey opened his eyes little and looked at her
Now and then he shifted the position of the tommy gun lying across his knees
Night had stilled Fallon Street
DEATH MASQUERADE The heavy rumble of wheeled traffic was gone
Only random street car clanged and crashed its way over rails
Between the street cars there was silence
The pushcarts along the curbs were covered over against the night and the merchants van ished
Even the children had disap peared
The footsteps of hurrying passersby echoed hollowly from the buildings
The street lamps threw fitful illumination
HE only living thing in Fallon Street seemed to be that crooning voice of Rosa Golden
The quiet was heavy oppressive like the quiet be fore the unleashing of summer thunder storm
black sedan rolled slowly through Fallon Street
It was show ing parking lights only
It rolled around the corner disappeared
Lacey glanced at it followed it with his eyes
figure in od
serge messenger boy flitted through the shadows darted across the street came to the door of the Golden store entered
Willie Quirks impishlooking face was touched for an instant by street light
His face was tense his eyes snapping
Get ready Chief thats them he said
You sure asked Lacey
Sure black car
Four guys in it
Its cinch they were giving the joint case the first time around
When they come back its the busi ness Laceys voice was like the crack of whip lash
Okay Willie
Beat it back across the street
You know what to do and when
Keep out of the busi ness
Get it
Out Aw gee Chief protested Willie
Scram The od
serge uniform drifted back across the street was swal lowed up in the shadows
Lacey strode into the living quar ters behind the store
He carried the tommy gun in one hand
The round pan with its hundred rounds was slung over the gun
Rosa Golden looked at him her eyes wide
Her voice seemed swallowed by her throat
dont want you to be frightened Rosa said Lacey
havent but minute to talk
Theyre coming
want you to go out in the backyard
You wont be in any danger there
Go out and stayuntil its over
think this will be the last visit There was terribly grim something in his voice and the steely depths of his eyes were swirling
Im not afraid the girl said in steady voice
If there is danger should share it
should not let you Outsidein hurry ordered Lacey
Stay there He almost pushed her by main strength out into the darkness of the backyard
He put out the lights in the living quarters
He ran across the store in half dozen steps opened the door quietly went out onto the sidewalk of Fallon Street
There were three galvanized iron ash cans on the side walk near the curb
They were heavy and filled with ashes
They were arranged in strange pattern
They had been there for four days
They formed breastworks dozen feet east of the entrance to the no tions store of Samuel Golden
Lacey crouched on his knees be hind the cans
He held the tommy gun in his hands the muzzle behind the top of the cans
He was breath ing through set teeth
The silence was heavy oppressive
Then at the west end of the block the lights of car swung into Fallon Street
It passed under the first street lamp
It was black sedan running with parking lights
It eased over to the south curb running slowly
It ran more slowly as it drew abreast of the Golden store
Suddenly the windows of the car were rolled down and the machine came to momentary halt
Three black objects flew out of the car crashed through the plate glass win dow of the store
The muzzle of an automatic sub machinegun was thrust out of the car
It began to vomit flame to buck and jump with the recoil
The POPULAR DETECTIVE chattering staccato filled the canyon of Fallon Street with typhoon of noise
The most murderous noise in the world
The interior of the Golden store seemed to erupt flame and concus sion
The roar of three closely sep arated explosions shook the street
There was the sound of splintering and showering glass
Wood blasted to splinters flew through the air
Bits of bricks and stonework swirled madly fell with clatter
voice from the black sedan yelled Okay
Lets go
Ill bet that damn mug kicks through now The voice was answered by laugh
Behind the ash barrels Lacey white grin on his face rested the muzzle of his tommy gun on the top of barrel
His finger crooked around the trigger
The engine in the car raced roared
The car lurched forward
At that moment Lacey squeezed the trigger of his gun
The muzzle spat flame and de struction
The windshield of the black sedan disappeared
There were momentary screams from within the car
The car rolled over the side walk crashed into wall spilled over on its back and above every other sound was the terrible rivet hammerlike firing of Laceys tommy gun
After minute the gun went dead in his hands the ammunition ex pended the gun whitehot
He knelt there looking at the wreck of the black sedan
Then he got to his feet took his automatic from his vest pocket walked slowly toward the overturned car
CROSS the street Willie Quirk blew one shrill blast on his po lice whistle
At almost the same instant squad car with submachinegun operator came around into Fallon Street stopped with squealing of brakes
Lacey was standing over the wreck of the car queer tense expression on his face
He watched while the cops pulled riddled bodies out of the car
Watched the expressions on the faces of the cops
He watched until the morgue wagon came up until Fallon Street was in the midst of seething excitement such as it had never known with men and women half dressed thronging the street
Men and women looking at the ex plosiongutted remains of Samuel Goldens store and at the bearded face of Samuel Golden who stood with tommy gun in his hands
Be careful of that mug with the gold tooth whispered Lacey
He was in the back seat and tried not to hurt him much
want to talk to that guy later
Take good care of him and save him
He be longs to me The sergeant on the detail nodded
The morgue wagon pulled away
Lacey went into the ruins of the store into the backyard
He found Rosa Golden standing there her face white little trickle of blood run ning from her cheek where splin ter had scratched her
Is it all over she asked tone lessly
Lacey looked at her face
Its all over he said
Ive got little mopping up to dobut that gang is going to leave Fallon Street alone from now on Suddenly she seemed to collapse
He put his arm around her the arm holding the tommy gun
He held her with the wreckage of every thing her life had been tumbled and heaped about her in ghastly debris Willie Quirk was standing in the shadows of the ruined building
Look Willie growled Lacey Take care of Miss Golden here Stay with her till come back
wont be long Then the stooped figure still in the likeness of Samuel Golden made its way through the blackened ruins of the little store and disappeared DEATH MASQUERADE CHAPTER Fallon Street Triumph NSPECTOR WIL LIAM JOHNSON of the Homicide Squad threw open the door of the little room and kicked bloody snarling fig ure inside
gold tooth was promi nent in the mouth of the bloody face
The little room was without windows
When the door was closed it was like cell
The walls were dead white
There was one chair in the room
plain wooden kitchen chair
The floor was concrete
The walls were thick and sound proof
There was tripod in one corner of the room tripod with brilliant reflector and two thousandwatt lamp
Johnson looked at the man
He grinned
You look like hell Angelo he said almost cheerfully
But dont let that worry you
Youre going to look lot worse There was muffled knock on the door
Johnson crossed the room threw the door open
Four men came inside
They were big men with huge shoulders
Two hundred pounders
They were in sweatshirts and gym pants
They were grinning
Grinning with icy eyes
They looked at the man
They looked at Johnson
Suddenly the atmosphere within the room became grim taut
called you boys in because want you to meet AngeloAngelo Vittori said Johnson pleasantly
Maybe you boy have met Angelo before
Hes big shot
Yes sir big shot boys
Angelo is in the gouge racket
He runs Merchants Protective Association over Fallon Street way
Does his collecting with pineapples and tommy guns and blackjacks Dont you Angelo There was an ugly glinting light Johnsons eyes
There was silence
Angelo Vittori sat in the middle of the room on the kitchen chair
Why the hell dont you go to work and cut out the gags he snarled
You might as well get in your licks now
Ill be sprung out of this rat trap as soon as my mouthpiece gets the news
Until thenamuse yourselves

The four men grinned mirthlessly and their hands opened and closed spasmodically
They looked at John son for the cue
Angelo and his partners went drumming up business tonight
They threw the works into little store on Fallon Street pineapple and tommygun business from the street
Only something happened
Its all so strange
Just when they were ready to roll away in nice new Caddy tommy gun picks em up and Angelo here is the only sur vivor
Isnt he lucky Those terrible mirthless grins were turned on Angelo Vittori
He sat there his mouth snarling sweat running down over his eyes from his scalp mixing with the smear of blood on his face
Whos your boss Angelo asked Johnson suddenly in low whisper
Go to hell Come on whos your boss in sisted Johnson
You can save your self lot of grief by playing this straight You heard me sweatshirted sleeve suddenly swung
There was the crack of knuckles across Vittoris mouth
Blood spurted from under the knuckles
Say sir to the inspector you chean punk growled voice or Ill feed you your own teeth Vittoris tongue lapped up the blood on his mouth
His eves swirled as he looked at the detective
Big brave guy he sneered
See how brave youll be in the hot squat said Johnson sweetly
Under the blood and hate Vittoris face was suddenly white
His eyes glistened
Where the hell do you guys get POPULAR DETECTIVE that hot squat stuff he said in the same sneering voice
But there was brittleness mixed with the fear and fear crawled in his eyes
Why dont you know
They still fry gorillas in this state for mur der said Johnson in patient voice
You guys must think youve got an amateur snarled Vittori
What dya meanmurder
You cant frame me

Youd have to have connec tions
Somebody with brainsto tell you what to do Yeah

Speak when you are spoken to hood said the husky voice
So you think youre not going to fry eh said Johnson
You said it

He looked at the men in the room with him
After mo ment he said and he was still smil ing Bring in Mr Goldento iden tify him Mike sweatshirted figure went to the door opened it went out
He re turned in minute and with him came the counterpart of Samuel Golden
The lights went down in the room only the cruel white light beat on the face of Angelo Vittori
Golden said Johnson look at this man closely
Ever see him before Cut out the comedy growled Vittori
Ill answer
Sure he saw me
Hes Sam Golden
He runs that store on Fallon Street Thats right isnt it Mr Golden asked Johnson quietly
The mouth under the beard moved
An old mans voice nervous an swered
Its right Mr Johnson
Hes coming to my store to make me join Merchants Union which am not wanting to join
Hes asking me twenty dollars weekdues hes calling it
Im refusing to pay
dont make so much
So he hits Sam Golden an old man with blackjack which he is carrying up his sleeve Johnsons eyes were looking at Angelo Vittori
His mouth was smil ing but the eyes were deadly
And youre not going to burn
he asked in the same soft voice
Listen what is this
Where do you get that burn stuff Vittori eyes were scornful
Well anyhow you hit him with sap is that it There was sud den quiet in the room
You hit Sam Golden an old man with sap because he wouldnt pay dues to your Merchants Protective Associa tion
So hit him with sap
So what
So make something of it growled Angelo
Ill beat that rap too
And that fry stuff dont kid me
aint killed nobody
dont never kill nobody
Only chumps go round bumpin guys off
Im no chump
Sure hit Golden little love tap to soften him up
But that aint killin
And Ill be out of here in twp hours The men in the room took long breath
They smiled little more
They looked at Vittori
So you hit Samuel Golden with blackjack because he wouldnt pay dues in the Merchants Protective Association Johnson seemed to caress the words as they came out of his mouth
You can hear cant you snarled Angelo
And so what DEATH MASQUERADE The old mans hands went up to his head
Very slowly
His eyes were fixed on Angelo Vittoris face
The hands took off the skullcap deliberately tossed the black object into Vittoris lap
Then just as slowly the same hands manipulated an old mans wig took it off almost like scalping himself revealing close cropped brickred hair under the wig
And little by little the hands worked at the spirit gum and the beard came away from the jaws
The beard followed the skullcap and the wig onto Vittoris knees
ITTORI sat there his face ghastly staring
His throat worked
His eyes stared
As last gesture the cunningly contrived lines were wiped off the old mans face on the back of sweatshirt
And Red Lacey stood in the room still dressed in Samuel Goldens threadbare pants and al paca coatbut Red Lacey
Remember me Vittori asked Laceys voice coldly
The name is Lacey There was hoarse cry in Vit toris voice
Hey what the hell is this
What the hell is this guy going around dressed like Golden for
Whats the angle Did you say you werent going to fry Angelo asked Johnson in voice that suddenly held chill an icy chill
Did you say youd beat the rap
Did you say you hit Golden on the jaw with sap but that was not killing Sure said it There was little shriek in the voice
Youre wrong as hell Angelo said Johnson
It was murder
He was dead when you were running out of the store after you conked him with the blackjack
He was an old manyou killed him Vittoris hands clutched at the air
Its lie
plant damn it
The boys see him in the store after that
Dont he half kill Tony and Big Mike Cleary when they go around to collect
Dont he get his mug in the papers What
An old man like Sam Golden beating up two tough guys like Mike and Tony chided Johnson
When brains were passed out you didnt hear the dinner bell
The gentleman who gave Mike and Tony the rocking and socking was Mr Lacey here
All dressed up like Sam Golden
Sure using you guys as suckers
Making you come back and dig your own graves wiping you out
The whole mangy squeal ing pack of you
Spilling your blood on the same street where you spilled Sam Goldens

For the hot squat Suddenly Angelo Vittori collapsed in the chair
His eyes stared down at the skullcap and the beard and the wig
You guys wouldnt kid me about something like this would you he whimpered
Naw we wouldnt kid you An gelo nodded Johnson
Its on the level
Sam Golden is dead
You killed him And in my neighborhoodal most on my own corner snarled Lacey

And your boss who got the import ant dough from the racket is going to Like hell he is screamed Vit tori
His face was purple his eyes staring

Sure he told me that today
Well he aint going to sit in that picture gallery and eat off gold plates and look at guys as if they were worms while fry
To hell with him Ah sighed Johnson
Now we are getting somewhere Go get him screamed Vittori
Bring him down here
Throw him in lousy cell
See how that fits his Park Avenue clothes and his Harvard line of talk
Let him lay on the cement and feel the lice crawl over him
Who the hell is he any way Yeah whispered Johnson
Who is he Moore spat Vittori venomously
Herbert Slocum Moore of the Park Avenue Moores
Hes the front for this mob
Its his racket

They ran tongues over mouths

Nothing less than the Supreme Court for him
Moore Laceys voice was grating

Naw aint liar

You guys will be able to fry two eggs He laughed wildly cackle
He isnt lying said Lacey grimly

But anything to aid the police Johnson looked at him
At the sleek hair and the gold and black dressing gown at the richness of the room and the wolflike features of Herbert Slocum Moore
May offer you gentlemen your first cigar of the day smiled Moore
He lifted walnut box that matched the desk opened the lid held it toward Lacey and Johnson
No thanks said Johnson gruffly
Dont use them said Lacey
He was watching Moores eyes
Moore sank down in chair be hind the desk
And now Inspec tor whats on the mind of the po lice force so early in the morning DEATH MASQUERADE am here to arrest you as an accessory before the fact of murder committed upon the person of Sam uel Golden Johnsons voice droned ominously within the dead stillness of the apartment
Moore drew long breath

Really its little out of taste He reached for cigar his hand stopping halfway across the desk
Its no joke Moore snapped Johnson
Weve got Angelo Vit Herbert Slocum Moore stood in front of his desk the automatic in his hand half raised
There was look of polite surprise on his face
Then his mouth sagged open and his eyes glazed and he fell forward his head smashing inertly against the heavy top of the walnut desk
Johnson was across the room in three strides
He looked at Moore and then he looked up at Red Lacey
Damn it he beefed at Lacey

PROBAK junior Steve Lake Slides Out of Favor on Hot IceBut Cool Thinking Lays Trap for Killer
By FREDERICK PAINTON Author of Hot Dough Brute Kill etc
TEVE LAKE stood in the echo ing corridor of police head quarters in Centre Street and stared glumly at the door through which he must presently enter
It was simple oldfashioned door half of wood half of frosted glass
And on the glass in gold leaf letter ing was printed INSPECTOR RIORDAN
Steve Lake had to go through that door
Standing here he was detective thirdgrade in the Jewelry Squad
But after he went in there he would be patrolman flatfoot assigned to some precinct in the Bronx where he could break his arthes on long beat
In short they were going to bust Steve Lake
If he had deserved this break he could have pushed his chin out and gone in to take his medicine
But to be broken to harness bull simply because older policemen in the de POPULAR DETECTIVE partment were jealous of his quick promotion aroused his anger at in justice
Was it his fault that he chased three bandits escaping from drug store stickup and shot it out with them killing one and wounding the other two after he himself had been shot down
Was it his fault that Commissioner Harkness anxious for favorable publicity had publicly com mended him and then announced that patrolmen of such courage should be rewarded and promoted him to detective thirdgrade
He took deep breath got new bite on his gum
Standing there thinking wasnt going to help
He had been put on the Dewarr stick up because the guys that hated him knew he couldnt break the case
And he hadnt
It didnt matter that the Dewarr holdup was perfect job without clue that Einstein himself couldnt solve it
He had flopped and hed have to pay the price of failure
Someone calling his name broke his reflections
Hey Lake telephone for you couldnt imagine anything im portant coming over the phone but he seized on the interruption to postpone his appearance before In spector Riordan
He hastened back to the Jewelry Bureau
The two older dicks ignored him except to nod coldly to the phone
Lake picked up the receiver said Hello Lissen Lake came rasping nervous voice this is Gimpy Martin
Watchu willin to pay for hot tip on the Dewarr stickup Gimpy Martin was fink stool pigeon
He had also been what is called punk or gang hangeron
Every New York dick cultivates and builds up his own sources of infor mation through stoolpigeons
And Lake had caught Gimpy trying to push in an East Side cutrate jew elry store
He held this charge over Gimpy and bought occasional hot underworld tips from Gimpy at ten dollars tip
He was reliable
Lakes facie grew tauta lead at last
He might still break the Dewarr case and stave off the loss of his shield
He said Ill pay plenty
What have you got Bring fifty bucks around to the Barkley Hotel said Gimpy cun ningly and Ill belch an earful The line clicked and went dead
Lake put the receiver back on the cradle
Old Pieter Van Hoosen who had been cop when Steve wore diapers growled gruffly Inspector Riordan just called and says for you to hop in and make it snappy Lake smiled
If you boys are waiting around for the funeral you may have long wait He strode briskly into Inspector Riordans of fice
Hello Chief he forced smile
Detective Lake reporting You mean Patrolman Lake re porting corrected Inspector Rior dan
He was big leathery man with square face square jaw and hard disillusioned eyes
Now wait minute Inspector Lake began and told him of the new development withholding only Gimpys name as was customary
With this lead Lake concluded think can bust this case wide open Maybe you could Inspector Rior dans expression did not change only its been busted wide open
Its settled
The diamonds have been re turned What Lake was staggered
Dont you read the papers Riordan held up noon edition of the Sphere
In black headlines across eight columns it read DEWARR DIAMONDS RECOVERED And in lesser type Asah Stone famous private detective re turns one hundred thousand dollars in gems to Dewarrs after police fail to break case
Lakes eyes sped down the thick blocks of grey printing and he was sick at what he read
It was Asah Stone this and Asah Stone that the renowned private detective the bril liant private sleuth who had sue WHAT
NO IMAGINATION
ceeded where the police had failed
But when you got rid of all the compliments and the literary efforts of reporter trying to pad out story it summed down to this that Asah Stone by means which he had not revealed had recovered the hun dred thousand dollars in diamonds stolen from Mrs Jonathan Dewarr when she had been held up in her suite at the Hotel Superbe fort night ago
There was something else too that Steve read with sick heart
Set two columns wide in bold black type was short editorial boxed at the top of the page entitled WHATS WRONG WITH THE POLICE
It said lot of bitter terrible things about inefficiency hinted at graft and corruption and political stupidity and wound up by saying Has it come to this in our city that private detective can succeed where eighteen thousand policemen fail
Is Asah Stone more brilliant than our two thousand detec tivesOR IS HE MORE HONEST
Wow muttered Lake
He knew that the Sphere was against the present police commissioner but this was the boldest most vicious attack yet made
Wow is right growled Riordan
The first thing Harkness did was to call me and have you suspended on charges of inefficiency
And thats where you are now The goat said Lake bitterly sent to join the other goats in the Bronx Its worse than that lad said Riordan
Youll probably be dis missed from the force
Harkness is in spot and somebody has to take the fail Lake recoiled
His anger flushed his face red
But they passed up older men to stick me on this case because they wanted to see me busted he yelled
They wanted to reduce me because older men were jealous Thats department politics Rior dan said coldly
You laid an egg on this case and you pay He held out his hand
Ill take your shield Slowly Lake unpinned the shining shield
How proud he had been of it
Blowing on it to polish off the moisture proud of it looking upon it as symbol of high duty
Riordan took the bit of metal and flipped it into the drawer
He sat silent in dicating that the interview was over
Lake said suddenly Well if Asah Stone recovered the diamonds where is the pinch
Who did he turn over for the job IORDAN stared disgustedly
He didnt pinch anybody
He just made deal with the thieves and got back the jewels He snorted
How dumb are you anyway
You know Asah Stone is retained by most of the big insurance companies
Those diamonds were insured for hundred thousand dollars
If Asah Stone can make contact with the thieves and offer them fifty grand no questions asked they take it
Mrs Dewarr gets back her diamonds
The thieves get an easy fifty grand and the insurance company saves fifty thousand dollars But thats compounding felony protested Lake
Thats just urging these bandits to go ahead and keep on knocking off rich dames who wear too many jewels
Maybe that accounts for the sixteen big jewel stickups in the past year Riordan twisted impatiently
The trouble with you Steve is that you havent got any imagination
You cant figure beyond cause and effect
Thats why Im satisfied youll never make detectivebeat it now Im busy The bright sunshine on Centre Street seemed pale and weak as Steve Lake stumbled to the curb
Mechanically he tossed away his gum unwrapped another stick folded it and put it in his mouth
The first shock had passed his fury was under control
Whats imagination got to do with being dick he muttered
Suddenly his teeth clicked
He waved down cab
Fulton and Broadway he growled and sank back against the cushions
He didnt move all during the trip
At the POPULAR DETECTIVE corner of Fulton and Broadway he climbed two flights of stairs and entered an office whose door bore the sign ASAH STONE Private Investigator To the girl at the desk he said Hi sweetheart is the man marvel in She went on smearing lipstick with the tip of her right little finger
He just came in
dont know whether he sees dicks with broken arches
Im not your sweetheart Lake grinned Right you belong to the world He pressed on be fore she could reply to the door marked Private He opened with out knocking but evidently the girl had pressed buzzer for Asah Stone was standing smiling toward him
Well well he chuckled if it isnt Steve Lake the harmonica player in person
Hows the oneman band Asah Stone looked like smoothie
He was tall with broad shoulders
He had smartly cut grey hair nar row grey eyes
He wore grey suit and his thin long grey face had the wary expression of one who knew all the answers
Looking at him Steve thought of clever grey fox
SAH STONE was guy going places
The best night spots saw him he squired the snappiest look ing blondes
He spent big money and got his name in the paper often enough to have reputation as the best private dick in Americaand he charged accordingly Hello said Lake
He kept his dislike for Asah Stone out of his eyes
Deduction tells me said Stone that youve come about the Dewarr diamonds You must do it with mirrors re joined Lake
What want to know is will there be pinch in the Dew arr case
How did you recover the diamonds
And One question at time laughed Stone
happen to know that you dont own badge any longerthat if youre lucky youll wear your heels to the ankle shuffling around in harness
But at that Im willing to tell you few things Go ahead Lake kept his moutn stretched in forced grin
There will be no pinch stated Asah Stone
First because this was dicker made as representative of the insurance companies to save them money
Second dont know who did the job anyway He gestured to Lake invited him to approach the flattopped desk
Here is the record he continued
put an advertisement in the Sphere to make contact with the thieves
Read it if you want to
The advertisement was answered by this letter the words cut as you can see from daily newspapers
They or he or she asked fifty grand
talked with the Consolidated Insurance people and they okayed the price
put another ad in the Sphere accepting
There it is
And heres the reply telling me to put up the dough in old fivebuck bills and check the package at Grand Central Terminal He grinned smartly at Lake
Neat but not gaudy eh Go on said Lake grimly
Asah Stone shrugged
was to walkas you can read in the in structionsto the Twentieth Cen tury train gate
was to drop the check
did so
guy picked it up and handed it back to me
It wasnt the same check
walked to the checking booth and turned in my stub
The package got contained the diamonds
Thats all Not quite said Lake quietly
You saw the guy that handed you the substitute stub No corrected Asah Stone
deliberately didnt look at him so wouldnt have to testify Lake stared at him
Its racket he muttered
You and the thieves and the insurance company dishing somebody out of fifty grand
Whats your cut The insurance company pays me an annual retainer Then therell be no pinch no clues Asah Stone shrugged
Im paid WHAT
NO IMAGINATION
to recover the jewels not to grab hot boys
If you had any imagina tion youd see that It dont take any imagination to see that you connive with thieves Asah Stone flushed redly
Are you insinuating Im crook wouldnt know now snapped Steve
How did those thieves know youd play ball
Before they had the dough they gave you the check stub
How did they know but what having got the check stub you might have slipped them package of cut newspaper Ive got reputation for playing square Settled other cases like this Fifteen Stone said softly
So what So Im keeping on digging
might turn up plenty TONE thrust his chin out came close
Thats another crack and the last
Get to hell out of here He made the mistake of giving Lake rough shove
The trigger on Lakes anger snapped home
His right arm swung up throwing four hard knuckles and riding behind the punch one hundred and eighty pounds of fightingmad cop
The knuckles clicked on Asahs jaw just as the private dick himself threw punch
large engraved black onyx ring on his hand scratched Lakes fore head
But Asah Stone himself went backward
He lit on the back of his neck and did not get up
Lake rubbed his forehead looked at the onyx ring
cutting ring he said
Im fool but feel better now He backed to the door
Stone glared at him
In twenty minutes punk every cop in New York will be looking for you to make pinch for assault and battery
Ill not only see you dis honorably discharged but Ill see you in stir for that blow Nuts said Lake
He turned and went out of the office down to the stairway
Lake went down to the bright sun shine of the street
He stood for moment wiping the scratch on his forehead with handkerchief
Steve darling said voice that snapped him upright with thrill of joy
figured youd be here
And heres me to give you an earful Lake grinned at her
Hello Scrumptious
Well have to put off getting married until get my shield back Youll put it off until say yes Marjorie Steele said and that wont be until the sixth Friday in October
Im career gal Your career will be cooking corned beef and cabbage and rais ing mess of kids They started walking up Broadway
Youre immodest she smiled
But cut out the cracking
Ive got news Good news If you had any imagination it would be
was around to the Dewarrs to see about an inter view on why bigbosomed lasses wear diamonds
learned from her that the diamonds had been recov ered
immediately suspected Asah Stones crooked hand and dropped by here to check with him before wrote my story
And who do you think saw going into Asah Stones office Lakes eyes gleamed
It wasnt Santa Claus Scrumptious It may be Santa Claus to you she retorted
Darling it was Moxie Ardery Not the beautiful boy bandit The longlashed peachskinned little rat himself she nodded
Lake stood very quietly then pulled out crumpled package of cigarettes straightened one lit it handed it to Marjorie and then lit one for himself
Stand very quiet Lovely he said until think this through
Ive got an idea and since it didnt tear my head open maybe its good He stared abstractedly across City Hall Park
Moxie Ardery was notori ous from one end of Broadway to the other as youth of twentyfive who had started out as punk and had become in few years the smartest bandit in the game
His POPULAR DETECTIVE downy skin and handsome looks got him into the better hotels where women fell for him and he sized up lone woman or husband and wife with jewels
The jewels were stolen either by sneak thief or at the point of gun
Moxie was never caught with the goods and if ar rested had an alibi
OXIE is an underworld term meaning smart having lots on the ball
Moxie Ardery had all that
The connection between him and the Dewarr diamonds was obvious
The proof of his guilt was something else again
The fact that he came to see Asah Stone was important enough to show Moxie as the probable intermediary to settle the details of returning the diamonds
But you couldnt prove that
In short as Lake realized about all this tipoff was good for was to make Gimpys information of value
He had to see the stoolie at once
He raised hand hailed cab
Where are you going Marge de manded
Im going to see man about horse grinned Lake
Thanks Scrumptious
Have dinner with me tomorrow night and Ill give you Santa Lucia on the new harmonica
Its honey He got into the cab and Marjorie climbed in beside him
go for the dinner but God forbid have to hear you play
Lead on MacDuff
smell story for the Sphere If break this youll have story he agreed grimly
This is what you people call ring of jewel thieves
There are plenty of brains behind it There was silence for while until Marge suddenly said Youd be great detective if you had imagina tion to go with your memory for facts Hey lay off growled Lake
Detectives dont need imagination
Youve been reading books Marjorie sighed
Skip it Lovey And so nothing was said until they reached the Barkley Hotel on Third Avenue
The Barkley was cheap hotel where for few dollars week you got room with key to it within walking distance of bath room
Gimpy had room on the fourth floor walkup that left both Steve and Marge without wind
The corri dor even in daylight was lit by the sickly glow from drop cord bulb
The numerals twentysix were pen ciled on the chipped front of door
Lake knocked
Its me Gimpy he said Steve Lake He heard no sound and rattled the door knob impatiently
Then he pounded
Open up Gimpy Still silence
Lake looked suddenly at Marge
She was pale and sud denly her eyes were wide with in tuitive horror
Lake hurled himself at the door
His broad shoulders re bounded and he hit again
This time the flimsy lock gave and he sprawled inside
One look was enough
Stay out there kid he rapped
But she was already behind him
He felt her sway against him
My God she muttered hes dead He wasnt sung to sleep Lake countered
Come on kid buck up He left her there and walked to the body that lay sprawled on the cheap whiteenameled bed
Gimpy had looked like weasel in life with his big buck teeth and now his mouth opened in death he looked more like weasel than ever
Lakes trained eye took in the details so he knew what had happened as well as if he had been here
Somebody socked him on the jaw he said
See the bruise on his cheek
Oddshaped bruise
He started for the telephone in the hall and he was shot with silenced gun
Right through the pump no it must have just missed the heart be cause theres blood on his lips
But he didnt live long
Just long enough to take out that dollar bill Dollar bill said Marge
wonder why He felt of the body
Already get ting cold
Say an hour ago he was shot he said
And as he spoke these words his eyes widened in sur prise
By the Lord Scrumptious WHAT
NO IMAGINATION
he was killed within minute or two after he called me at Headquarters
Somebody heard him or knew he was going to squeal
Now hell never squeal The realization sickened him
He never knew until now how much he had banked on Gimpys information
He was up against blank wall once more
Moxie Ardery Marge called
He did it Steve
He must have
You told me yourself Gimpy used to play around with Moxies mob Lake nodded
The theory is log ical darling but you have to prove it He studied the bruise memoriz ing the purple pattern of it
Then he searched the body and found noth ing
He stood for space bitterly dis appointed
Then he took the dollar bill and stared at it curiously
Funny thing for dead man to do he muttered
Whywell Ill be damned What is it Marge cried breath lessly
Lake pointed to the dollar bill
In the upper righthand corner and in the lower left was printed the bills serial numberEN
But someone with an indelible pencil or ink had marked the letters and cer tain numbers
The letter was marked then the numbers two eight three one seven and finally the Marge looked puzzled
see it but what does it mean she asked
AKE looked at the corpse
Gimpy you were genius What do you mean Suppose said Lake softly you wanted to keep telephone number and didnt want to carry around paper that could be found
Sup pose Marge cried It is telephone number Steve
EN twoeight threeoneseven Endicott on hunch said Lake
Its clue Marge was trembling with excitement
Lake shrugged
He didnt get it out for tip He wrapped his hand in hand kerchief and telephoned Centre Street
After he got Inspector Lana han and had told the facts of Gimpys murder he said And Inspector have them bring the infrared cam era
That bruise is peculiar Hey what you doing there
You wait until Lake hung up
Wait until he pinches me for socking Stone he muttered
Come on Scrumptious lets trace this telephone number They called the superintendent who when he heard police busi ness immediately dug into his files
Its private listing he told Lake
Robert Hardell Importer Ninefiftyone Riverside Drive Marge cried Moxie Ardery for dime Maybe said Lake
Anyway you go into your office and write what you have and Ill meet you at eight for dinner Then we go calling she laughed
Then we go calling At eight oclock however
Lake was not waiting for Marge
He was crossing the lobby of the apartment house at Riverside Drive
Shed be sore he knew but if this was what he expected it to be then no girl belonged
The Nassau negro took him up to the ninth floor and pointed to door
Mr Hadell lives there but dont know if hes in Lake rapped on the door
For long time there was silence
Then voice said Whos there Janitor said Lake
Theres water leaking into the apartment be low There was long silence the sound of whispering
Then the door was unlocked opened about six inches
Listen janitor said voice fix it later cant you
My wifes Lake put his number nine shoe in the opening his shoulder against the door and pushed
He went inside in hurry as the resisting body sur rendered to his strength
Just minute Moxie he said this is pinch and the charge is murder The boy bandit was beautifulno other word described him
Yellow POPULAR DETECTIVE curly hair bright blue eyes and soft pink skin on perfectly chis eled face
Only his ear lobesor rather lack of lobesdistorted his face hinted at the mental twist that had made him crook
That and the bitter cold inhuman blaze in his eyes as he stared at Lake
Lake thrust the door closed behind him and backed the youth into the living room
There was consterna tion hateeven fearin Moxies ex pression as he slowly retreated
Once Lake saw him glance swiftly at his wristwatch diamond and platinum affair that belonged more properly on awomans wrist
Lake kept his hand in his right pocket the nose of his gun pressing hard against the cloth and making lump
Beyond Moxie he saw yel lowhaired bit of painted fluff with wide saucerlike eyes
Also short stocky man whom Lake had never seen before
Drop your guns in the middle of the floor Lake said and do it easy Im just holding this trigger with my thumb Moxie said You cant do this you punkheaded lug
You aint dick any moreyoure out
You aint got any right to come in here Skip it cut in Lake
Im here
You killed Gimpy Martin Thats lie screamed the girl
He was with me and Ill swear to it Yeah said Lake
How did you know when the kill was done Her crimson mouth bit down
Moxie said Shut up Mae every time you open that trap of yours you put your foot in it Lake waited until two guns and blackjack lay in the middle of the floor
Then he moved slowly toward the table where the telephone was
Sit down he said while call the Homicide guys Moxie was purple
But didnt bump Gimpy he screamedand be sides It was the short stocky man who changed the complexion of things
His hand flicked once and an ink stand flew through the air as straight as an arrow
Lake had no time to duck
It smashed into the side of his head glancing blow but sufficient to trip him make him lunge to catch his balance and blind his inkfilled eyes to the trio
The short stocky man was hustling in on followup but Moxie beat him to Lake
Moxie made one flying leap landed on Lakes back and hooked both hands around Lakes throat
Get his gun George Moxie cried
George did more than that
He hooked punch to Lakes jaw then kicked the detective in the stomach
With Moxies weight on him Lake went down
Then they had his gun
He was brutally kicked toward the sofa
that instant had Moxie changed
His eyes grew to pinpoints and his mouth was lifted in terrible smile
Swell work George
admit he had me going Never let dumb cop get you going said George
had that ink stand all set the minute saw him come in They searched Lake but found noth ing but his twodeck harmonica the one he had paid twentytwo dollars for
Moxie laughed
remember now youre the guy that plays the mouthorgan Lake went on wiping the ink off his face
The girl called Mae laughed hysterically God thought he was gonna bust up the big job we got Shut up snapped Moxie and George added Geez get twist into something and you start walkin on dynamite Moxie glanced at his wristwatch again
He reached for the telephone
Ill ask what we got to do with this flattie he said
Im worried silence came over the room and Lake sitting there listened intently as Moxie dialed the number
The de tective reached out and picked up his harmonica but he did not blow into it
He was counting the clicks as Moxies forefinger wheeled the dial and let it slide back
Presently Moxie said Hello yeah
Why we was all set to shove off for this job and this lug Steve Lake came in behind rod Yeah WHAT
NO IMAGINATION
we grabbed him
Do we throw him to the crabs He listened intently
So did Lake but while he could hear certain metal lic sounds over the wire he could not hear word spoken
Moxie nodded as if he could see the speaker
get it
Timetable stuff
Okay Ill do it that way
Ill drop the stuff with you and then fix this punk dick He hung up and turned to George
You stay here while me and Mae do what we got to do
If this lug gives you any trouble bounce him one good And how grinned George
Per manent Moxie nodded slowly
Perma nent Lake blew softly into the harmon ica and with his fingers cupped around it made Pennies from Heaven come out with surprising melody and skill
Moxie thrust Mae through the door
He drew on his gloves
Permanent he repeated
Mae was saying as the door closed never knew mouthorgan music was so pretty
Now you take Pete You take him growled Moxie hes your husband The door banged after them
Lake played the last bar
Does this bother you he asked
EORGE blasted smoke from his nostrils took out the cigarette spat in the waste basket
Go ahead it dont bother me none Lakes eyes moved reflectively around the room
He blew into the instrument and this time more loudly played The Night and You The music was quite loud
George lit cigarette from the stub of the first and all the movement he made was his foot beating time to the music
His automatic pistol and the hand holding it lay idle in his lap
Lake stopped for time staring at the opened windows and French doors that led to balcony
You really blow that thing George said
Lake said Yeah Ive been prac ticing since was kid He glanced at his wristwatch
shade of frown passed over his fore head
He began to blow again hot swing tune that had both of Georges feet tapping had his shoulders swing ing his head nodding appreciatively
George began to whistle through his teeth in accompaniment
The gun more relaxed was disturbed by his legs movements and slid over to one side
Gun and hand both were ready to slide down toward the floor
George was completely relaxed
Lake beating time with his feet got himself into position for plan he hoped to carry out
Swifter and swifter he worked up the time shoul ders shaking sitting bolt upright
George said Hahchaa
Boy is that hot And then as he was blowing out the last swift measures Lake already taut came off the couch in one hurt ling movement that was flow of strength and desperation
The har monica flew out and whacked George across the nose
He tried to raise his gun but it takes time to coordinate your muscles after youre all let down
And he didnt get the gun straightened out until Lake was alongside
One powerful downward blow para lyzed Georges arm and the gun belched redly to drive slug into the floor
Lake hooked George to the chin
He lifted him up socked him again
And George staggered back tripped and fell headlong to bang his head nastily against the side of the desk drawer
Blood drooled from his scalp and he didnt move
Lake got the gun tore up the portieres to make bonds and trussed George until he looked like mummy
Lake hurried to the door then went back for his harmonica and nodded
Swell he muttered and went out in the hall
He almost knocked Marge down
She had policeman with her
For once Marge had lost her poise
She leaped at Lake and flung her arms around his neck
Steve she gasped
thought they had you
Oh you were smart
It took imagination to play that har POPULAR DETECTIVE monica so could locate the apart ment
heard it and knew they had you and got cop Lake said huskily You mean you were going to crash in against those monkeys Youre okay she said flustered except when you run off and leave me to pay for my own dinner Did you get Moxie The mention of the boy bandit brought Lake back to reality
He nodded to the cop
Theres guy in there named George
He knows things
But you wont be able to hose them out in time
You take him down
Ive got things to do He glanced anxiously at his watch
Come on Marge he grabbed her hand
In the taxicab Marge gasped My God wheres the fire
Whats up Lake said Were going to bust up this jewel gang Youve got ideas she said
Yes but he didnt tell her what they were
At Times Square he stopped long enough to call Centre Street
To the detective who replied he said new hotel robbery re ported He gave his name
Mrs Ida Whitehouse was robbed of eighty grand in pearls not twenty minutes ago
But how the hell did you know Do you believe in fairies Lake said and hung up
Back in the cab Marge said to him Where are we going Pishing said Lake
Lets hope they all bite good At City Hall Park he picked up the cop on the corner
Get your gat ready Lake said this may be tougher than you think They cov ered the two blocks to Stones office
Something in Lakes expression brought the policeman silently at his heels
Marge was panting with ex citement as they went up the stairs
The same girl was putting more lip stick on the same lips when Lake camf in
Is the mental giant in there Steve asked
Yeah but hes busy No tipoff he growled waving his gun at her head
She let go the plug
He banged against the door and when it held drove his fist through the frosted glass and then reached inside and unlocked the door
Asah Stone was jumping up from behind the desk
Moxie Ardery had gun out but the cop said Now now and Asah Stone halfturning growled Are you crazy
Put up that gun HEN his eyes blazing he strode to Lake
Now what the hell does this mean stupid It means rejoiped Lake calmly that youre under arrest for the murder of Gimpy Martin
Youre charged with being the big shot of bandit syndicate picking out the peo ple to be robbed and splitting the insurance dough that you get for re covering the jewels
It means rat that youre an ac cessory before and after the fact of the robbery of Mrs Dewarr and Mrs Ida Whitehouse
And one buck will get you fifty that Moxie Arderys got the pearls on him or theyre in your desk Youre nuts laughed Asah Stone
Me kill Gimpy Martin
Why should want to kill punk like that Because he knew you were the guy that engineered the thefts said Lake pleasantly
You got your rec ords from the insurance company
They told you who had the most valj able jewels and how much insurance they carried as precaution
You got guys like Moxie to go out and knock off the catch and then split with them on the dough paid by the insurance company Well grinned Asah Stone if youre that crazy are you crazy enough to say you can prove it Sure nodded Lake
All of sudden he grabbed Asah Stones right hand
He wrenched off the ring the black onyx ring with the peculiar design
You hit Gimpy with this and the ring left its impression
This new photographing by infrared rays picks up designs like that easy
It was your trademark His face never revealed what hunch what guess that was
NO IMAGINATION
Asah Stone turned livid
Then went on Lake Moxie tele phoned you after he caught me in his apartment
Called you about this Whitehouse job
He dialed the num ber in silent room Stone and counted the clicks
Two two six six nine two one
Check that on any telephone and its Canal Before Stone could say word Lake went on And Moxie you take rap for murdering Gimpy too
You were with Stone and that makes you an accessory
Gimpy put the finger on you by holding dollar bill that had your telephone number on it No no howled Moxie suddenly
Stoney knocked him off
On account of Gimpy seen Stoneys girl wearing that Dewarr necklace before Stoney sent it back
He did it
didnt know he was going Stone went for the man in death struggle
But Lake and the cop pulled them apart and held them screaming accusations and invectives
phone call brought prowl car and the Homicide Squad men
The next day Lake went to the Sphere office in response to Marges summons
Youre reinstated she said
Just got call from Centre Street
Better yet Harkness says he intends to make you secondgrade detective How sweet of him said Lake sourly
They make you second grade dick today and tomorrow if you fumble they take it away However he was thrilled though he didnt let Marge see it
She said earnestly Steve youre wonderful
never knew you had that much imagination
Figuring out that telephone call marking the print of that ring Imagination the devil protested Lake
Those are facts
You just find them and you dont need any imagination
They tell their own story She reached up gave him hearty kiss
Does that arouse your imag ination she demanded
No said Lake that tells me that on detective secondgrades pay we have an apartment on the West Side and you learn to cook corned beef and cabbage at least once week Next Month THE BUDDHA WHISPERS Diamondstone Novelette by FlemingRoberts NOT GUILTY Dont be gnilty of scraping your face

But wasnt sensing any thing when started back to my office after dinner that night rounded the corner without thought in my mindand then saw it
car was in front of my office building
girl stood next to the car back to it facing the building entrance
Her face was crazy with fear and her hands were tearing at her throat
No not at her throat
They were tearing at two hands reaching out from the sedan hands that strangled her
saw veins knot on those mur derous hands saw the girls face suffuse with blood
pounded toward the car at top speed
If could get my mitts on the strangler But he heard me coming
got just flash of blue serge sleeves above the strangling hands then the To Whitewash Black Deeds Wily Killer Tactics Against Game of Greed
girl was released and the car screamed into gear
took one leap after it and stopped
The girl needed attention badly
Shed looked like shj was dead when she slumped to the walk with her face white and her throat bruised
But she opened her eyes when bent over her
Blue eyes
Ill take you to doctor said picking her up
NoIm all right she came back voice thick and burred
fainted for minute
Thats all Game kid
Her throat was turn ing livid now
Put me down please she said huskily
How did that happen bade there
Who was trying to kill you The girl shook her head
had my back to the car when the hands reached out
didnt see who owned the hands
PleaseI have to see man named Tevin in this building Youre seeing him now said
Runs he Gamut Mass iurd POPULAR DETECTIVE Youre Private Detective James Tevin Right replied setting her down on her feet
Come on up to the office and tell me about it She sat in the visitors chair trembling but not hysterical and explained
was nearly killed three days ago
Somebody tried to club me down late at night on the street
thought Id see private detective about it
You were recommended
came here and your office was closed
walked around the block then stopped at the entrance next to that parked car which thought was empty
And thehandsreached out for me If you were attacked three days ago said how is it youre just getting around to asking for help
And why not the police instead of private detective went to the police The girl shrugged
They said must have been attacked by common thug who ran when screamed
But know better
The man didnt try to take my handbag
But the police took three days to come to their conclusion
After which came here nodded
Lets start the routine
Name Harriet Warner Circumstances Im private secretary to paper wholesaler
An uncle and two cousins of mine live in the city but live alone She looked around my office
Its pretty well furnished if do say so myself
Im afraid cant afford you for very long Skip the walnut and bronze said
Ill make the fee right
Youre an office worker not wealthy yet twice youre almost murdered
Got any idea why It might have something to do with the other reason why wanted to see private detective she said
What other reason snapped her up
Another uncle of mine living in the Colchester Hills section died few days ago
His will is to be read tomorrow evening at his country place
After the attack the other night thought needed detec tive not only to investigate but also to go with me to the place as guard Well said
will several heirs
Maybe youre to be mur dered for your share of your uncles fortune Harriet Warner shook her head
Uncle Rudolph had money but Im not to get any of it
He told me short time ago that all was to get was his Colchester Hills home
The rest goes to my Uncle Ralph Rudolphs brother and my two cousins sons of Rudolphs dead sister shrugged
Perhaps theres something of value hidden in this new home of yours dont think theres buried treasure angle Harriet smiled
Youll see when you get there
It would be like trying to bury treas ure in city street
Its solid rock around my uncles house MADE an appointment to meet her next morning and drive her to Colchester Hills
had things all docketed in my mind
Wed hear the will read discover that Miss Warner had inherited more than she had expected to and thus find motive for one of the other heirs to murder her
With the motive in my possession could soon nail the killer
All neatly docketed in my mind
And all just as wrong as hell
She was Harriet and was Jim before we got to the Colches ter Hills nett evening
An awful nice kid
The more saw of her the more liked her and the more liked her the madder got at the skunk who had tried to strangle her barehanded
We got to the place at eight
Col chester Hills is rich mans stuff
Big estates
High meshedwire fences
Picturesque cliffs and waterfalls
The dead Rudolph Packers place was modest though only an acre in extent
The house was small Cape Cod in style of whitewashed brick
And how
The stuff DEATH IN COTTAGE was so spotless that it hurt your eyes to look at it
The grounds were solid humped stone with barely skin of soil over it
Harriet had been right about buried treasure
You couldnt have buried dog biscuit here with out dynamiting
Three cars were in front of the Cape Cod cottage
Two were nice jobs
The third could have been six years younger without hurting anything
Thats the lawyers car said Harriet of the latter
Uncle Ru dolph didnt have city lawyer
He did business with man named Cook from the near village of Boyn ton Your uncle lived here alone asked
Alone except for Strine said Harriet
Strine was with Uncle Rudolph for years
His servant
He cooked cared for the house and grounds everything
Hell be broken up about Uncle Rudolphs death Did Mr Packer commute to city office No
He was retired
He played the market now and then thats all
Played it shrewdly guess HE door of the house opened
An old man with leather face under white hair looked at us
Good evening Strine Harriet said and smiled
The old man bobbed his head
This isa friend Strine
Mr Tevin George Strine The old boy bobbed his head again wordlessly
Harriet and stepped through the door and into the liv ing room
drylooking elderly man with sideburns came up
Ive got something to tell you heard old Strine say to him in whisper
The elderly man only said Later please and looked at us
Harriet introduced him as the lawyer Bruce Cook
The others are all here Cook said
Theyre out in back
Ill get them Harriet and settled ourselves in the living room and in minute the rest straggled in her Uncle Ralph middleaged man with close set dark eyes her cousin Arthur Fitch blond young fellow with mouth like gash in his face her other cousin Corey Fitch taciturn man of thirty who stared at me with hostile eyes
didnt like Harriets relatives
It didnt make me like em any more to have Arthur Fitch say Why is Mr Tevin here
He has no connection with the family
reading of will is certainly private thing Is there any clause in the will forbidding me to bring friend demanded Harriet spunkily
Cook looked over the top of his reading glasses fussy but not un kindly
As far as the will is concerned you may bring any one you please Miss Warner With that settled Cook droned over the contents of the will
Har riets guess had been right
She got the house and grounds and all therein contained
The dead mans brother and nephews shared about fortyeight thousand dollars in cash
Such was the essence of it
Cook started packing papers in his briefcase
Corey Fitch and Ralph Packer walked to the French windows ignoring Harriet and me
Arthur Fitch went toward the back of the house
MOMENT later his horrified shout came to us
My God
Strine ran through the rear door of the living room through the dining room with the rest at my heels
Arthur Fitch wasnt shouting any more but could hear his heavy breathing like sobbing and ran for that
found myself in the kitchen
Fitch stood beside table staring down at something
Something of which could see only two legs sprawled in grotesque angles on the floor
jumped to the table and looked down ata corpse
POPULAR DETECTIVE It was Strine
He lay on his face in red pool
From his back stuck the wooden handle of butcher knife
The blade had pierced Strines heart
Hed never known what hit him
turned to keep Harriet back but she had already seen
Her face was the color of death
She looked at me with horror in her eyes then stared at the dead man again
They did to Strinewhat they tried to doto me she whispered through white lips
put my arm around her shoul ders and helped her back to the liv ing room
Then called the Boyn ton sheriff
KEPT thinking of one thing
The old servants urgent whisper to Lawyer Cook
Ive got something must tell you Had Strine been killed to prevent his speaking to Cook
But what could he have had to say that led to murder
He hadnt been given any thing in the will but home in this house for the rest of his life
Noth ing there to kill him for
The sheriff came from Boynton
His name was Schule and he had belly and chinablue eyes that stuck out
didnt think much of him
If didnt like Schule cared even less for Harriets relatives in the red light of murder
Ralph Packer was greyfaced with fear and his closeset dark eyes darted everywhere at once
Corey Fitchs dark face was bloodcon gested and his eyes glittered in feverish way
Arthur Fitch wan dered around with his hands in his pockets and his slitlike mouth as hard as granite
sadists mouth
How the hell had girl like Harriet emerged from his brood
Schule started with me first alone in the living room
Did you hear the old man yell or anything when he was killed in the kitchen No said
He wouldnt have been able to yell
He was struck from behind and the blow killed him instantly When want opinions Ill ask for em snapped Schule
You just answer questions
Were you in the kitchen between the time you got here and the time Strine was found dead shook my head
Got proof of that Miss Warner can tell you
was in the living room with her from the minute set foot in the house Shes your only proof Schule looked as triumphant as though hed discovered something
Was Strine killed before you gathered in here do you think
Or afterward You told me you didnt want opinions reminded him
Im duly authorized officer of the law be blustered getting pur ple
You answer my questions Okay
You want me to say whether Strine was killed by the man who found his body Arthur Fitch or not
dont know
But think Strine was killed before the will was read while everybody was out in back except Miss Warner and myself
The blood had begun to coagulate little when got to him Yeah but which could have done it muttered Schule for minute not pompous
The two Fitch broth ers old Cook Ralph Packer He jerked himself up
But dont think Im lettin you and Miss Warner out just because shes pretty and youre private detective
Tell Miss War ner to come in here Its bad luck to paste sheriff on the jaw so just went out
The rest were in the dining room
Some how my flesh crawled when saw them silent and whitefaced sit ting around the dining room table like so many ghosts
looked at Harriet who sat lit tle apart next to old Cook
Some one in this room it was almost cer tain had tried twice to kill her
The same person with almost equal cer tainty had murdered Strine
But why
motioned silently for her to go in to the sheriff
DEATH IN COTTAGE CHAPTER II Hidden Treasure IL the sheriff was grilling the rest moved around
had swung back to my first belief
Some thing valuable was hidden around this place that made Harriets bequest the richest of the lot
Something known only to the killer who had tried to murder Harriet to get it and had succeeded in murdering Strine to keep him from giving Law yer Cook hint of it
That was the only theory that fitted in with the attacks on the girl the killing of the servant and Strines urgent whisper There is something must tell you Something of value hidden here mentioned in the will only to the extent that Harriet got the house and grounds and all therein con tained set out to track it down
The grounds as has been said were out
You cant bury things bonds jewelry what notin solid rock
That left the house and garage
The garage was ruled out soon
Its walls were solid concrete
Its floors of cement could not have been disturbed without leaving trace anyway under them was the inevitable rock
Its ceiling was rafters with shingles laid directly on them and certainly no valuable article would be hidden in can of oil or box of tools or the dead mans sedan
That left only the house which seemed doubtful to me
The walls were out
had no ticed that the partition walls were of paperthin modern construction
No room in them for anything in the first place in the second any disturbance of them would have meant calling in outside labor to replaster or repaper which might have given the hiding place away
The outer walls were of brick two bricks thick
You couldnt hide anything there either de cided
Attic was too obvious
Floors Old Rudolph Packer in building the place had gone in for antiquity
Ceilings were beamed with bare wood of the floor above showing be tween the beams
No space there to store things secretly
And there was no basement the house rested on solid rock
That left the furniture consider ing which was slightly melodra matic idea or the trick of hiding something right under your eyes
walked toward the house white as snow in the moonlight with its immaculate coat of whitewash
saw Harriet coming out of the side door
She looked around and waved
She came toward me
couldnt stay in there any more she said in low voice
Im afraid nodded
That was certainly un derstandable in view of the proba bility that murderer was under that roof
Of course the rest were safe now with the sheriff right in the house but nevertheless Harriet couldnt be blamed for wanting to get away
We walked slowly around the house toward the front driveway
kept looking around
If there had been any lawn ornaments would have investigated them
But there were none
Ive never seen place so bare of possibilities for hiding things
Harriet would have to pull the furniture apart thought if this idea of hidden valuables per sisted enough to make the effort worth while
had to admit that was losing my own conviction again
How long will we be here
Jim she asked me wistfully
dont know said
You should be able to leave pretty soon now
Me too think
The others well it depends on the sheriffs ideas And added but only to mysdf If it was me Id hold the two Fitches and your uncle and give them plenty grilling POPULAR DETECTIVE We stood looking at the road fifty yards or so from the drive
Cars hummed past
Now and then local driver recognizing the sheriffs car at the door would pause little
But for the most part they sped past serenely unaware that mur dered man lay in the snowwhite Cape Cod cottage
It gave me kind of funny feeling
Harriet gripped my arms sud denly
What was that hadnt heard anything
sound from behind us she in sisted
Around the side of the house We walked back to the corner of the house and around
And the mo ment we rounded the corner we saw the long dark blotch on the ground next to the white wall
And Har riet screamed while grabbed her elbows and turned her around
Into the house
Get the sher iff went to the long blotchand looked down into the dead face of Arthur Fitch
face that was un touched though the bony structure of the head behind it was shat tered mass
mechanics heavy hammer reddened and gleaming in the moonlight lay near the pulped head
HE rest safe now with the sher iff in the house
echoed my thought of moment ago with cold chill touching my bones
Id bumped up against lot of vio lence in my life
But Id never seen anything to match the ruthlessness the icy recklessness of this killer now among us
ran on blind impulse to the nearest door and into the house after Harriet
didnt want her out of my sight
Not any more
Two men dead within space of an hour and half
One of them murdered while law officer was conducting an investigation under the same roof
But the sheriff wasnt having any of my guardianship over the girl
With two deputies hastily called from the village to watch the din ing room in which every one sat he beckoned me out to the second dead man
went leaving Corey Fitch looking numbed by the shock of his brothers death Lawyer Cook badly unstrung and fussing with one of the deputies who refused stolidly to let him get into his briefcase and Ralph Packer palsied mass of fear
have never seen man so frightened as Packer
But it was not the double fear youd expect
The fact that he was logically murder suspect didnt seem to oc cur to him
It was fear of death from the as yet undetected murderer that seemed to hold him most ab jectly
Looking around outside with Schule catalogued the findings
It was pretty easy because they were so few
Arthur Fitch had been killed from behind with the hammer taken from tool box in the garage
man could have done it all in three minutes by running from house to garage getting the weapon and running back to where Fitch stood smoking in the moonlight and re turning swiftly to the house again
Harriet and had been in front so we were out of the way
Why had Fitch been outside
Well half smoked cigarette put out by the damp grass near him told that
He had been out taking cigarette getting relief from the tenseness inside the house
And the killer had seen him and seized the chance to get rid of him
Well why had Strine been killed and Harriet attacked
It all seemed to make increasingly less sense as it got more complicated
Schule had shed his pomposity by now
This second killing done while hed been within ten yards was going to look like the devil for him
He flashed his light feverishly and pointlessly around
was talking to Mr Packer he said over and over again
said to him to get Arthur Fitch in again
told him to hunt Fitch up because it seemed to me before that Fitch had something he wanted to say and that he wasnt quite sure enough DEATH IN COTTAGE about it to put it into words
Some thing on his mind
So wanted to talk to him again
And then the girl comes running in saying theres dead man out on the lawn and its this guy Fitch
Damn it Im sure he had something to say only be fore he wasnt positive enough
You wouldnt talk against brother or uncle for instance unless you knew what you were talking about You sent Ralph Packer after him repeated
And uncles have killed nephews before
think Ill arrest Packer He looked pathetically re lieved
Yeah thats the stuff
It must have been Packer
He went after Fitch on my orders found him alone and killed him Why Eh said why
What reason would he have for murdering his sisters son How would know
But thats what must have happened Where was Corey Fitch Schule gnawed his lip again
dont know
He wasnt in the din ing room
Mr Cook can testify to that
So both the uncle and the brother of this guy were on the loose
Either one might have done it Or Cook or Miss Warner or me said
His eyes came back to mine with plenty of suspicion in them
Im not forgettin you and the girl were out on the lawn Keep on remembering it and see what it gets you told him
Id have lot of reasons for killing guys never even saw before Miss Warner would have rea son
She splits this guys share of Packers money now bit my tongue over that one
It was so evidentand so unexpected
Harriet had motive for murder in the eyes of the law
answered possible law court as well as Schule when said Nuts
was with her when both men died
saw her being at tacked herself
If you dont want to take my word for it just re member how much strength it takes to stick knife into meat
Miss Warner wouldnt have the strength to drive dull kitchen knife into mans heart from behind You would said Schule
And on that friendly note we went in to the house again and Schule again began chasing in cir cles to get his man
Meanwhile stuck close and tried to nail the killer on my own hook
But got no farther than Schule did
Ralph Packer sweating so that perspiration stains showed clear through his blue serge suit said he had been in the bedroom still searching for Arthur Fitch till just before Fitch was killed
Corey Fitch claimed he had been in the bathroom
Cook had been in the dining room
Amazingly when you remember sheriffs presence right in the house any one of them could have
made murderous oppor tunity out of the fact that Arthur Fitch had nervously decided to smoke cigarette in the moonlight
CHULE grilled us all again one by one
He asked some good questions at that noted with pro fessional interest
But he didnt get anywhere so he started sec ond time
We were again in the dining room Cook and Packer and Corey Fitch and Harriet and Schules voice came to us from the living room
Cook Cook got up moistening his lips averting his eyes from the door lead ing into the kitchen
There were two dead men lying in the kitchen now
One of the deputies opened the dining room door for the law yer and he walked through the tiny hall into the living room
And then just before the deputy had the door closed again saw Cook stop next to the outside liv ing room door and stare into the night
His mouth went slack
His hands went up to pluck at his trem bling lips
And he yelled hoarsely
It was high brittle cry almosl like womans scream
He pointec through the screened doorway
POPULAR DETECTIVE Sheriff
Out there
Oh my God The deputy wasnt interested in closing the dining room door any more
He threw it wide open and leaped toward Cook
Schule got there first
His hand gripped Cooks shoulder
What is it
What do you see out there Cook fought for words
When they did come they were like icy whips
figureout therein the moonlight
saw it
It looked like Strine CHAPTER III In the Dark ARRIETS gasp was like sob
sort of moan came from Ralph Packers lips
Then was out of the dining room on the heels of the other deputy and Corey Fitch
They started for the grounds
went for the kitchen where Strine lay
got the door open had one glimpse of two sprawled bodies on the floor and then the lights went out
All of them
Every light in the place
heard Cooks fearpacked scream sound out again from the front of the house
And an instant after that sound that drew hoarse shout in echo from my own lips
Harriet Warners shriek which died in horrible fashion into choking moan which was succeeded by com plete silence
lunged from the kitchen hit ting the partly opened door in the pitch darkness
got to the dining room door and it was locked against me
Through it could hear ter rible scraping of high heels on hard wood floor
The sound drove me crazy for minute
banged my shoulder against the door backed off tried jt again
Running steps sounded outside and the kitchen door to the back yard burst open
saw four dark shapes outlined against the moonlight heard Schules voice
My God Whats happened now
Strine voice thought was Corey Fitchs cut the sheriffs words off
Strines here where he was be fore
Anyway theres two bodies These things heard with half my mind
The rest was in that locked dining room with the girl whose heels were rasping so desperately and convulsively on the floor
caught up kitchen chair and smashed it to kindling against the door
And the door only quivered little
turned thrusting couple of shadowy figures out of my way ran out the back door and around to the dining room window
smashed the glass and climbed in
As the glass crashed thought heard sound across the room from the window but wasnt sure
In the rooms dimness saw Har riet lying near the table
jumped to her side bent down
couldnt feel pulse
Her face was ghastly in its pallor
Even in the dim light could see how her throat was swelled and discolored
got her hands saying some thing or other to her all the time
Things hadnt right to say so soon
But they came out anyway
began working her arms back and forth in artificial respiration
heard somebody yell in the liv ing room and then after quite little while the lights went on
All of which meant little to me
The important fact was that Harriet was beginning to breathe again and in little while she opened her eyes
Jim she whispered
Dont talk said chafing her wrists and making her head as com fortable as possible on my knee
Lights went out somebody grabbed me
Almost got methis timeJim kept on chafing her wrists
Al most got her
Hell she had been DEATH IN COTTAGE actually and literally dead
Only artificial breathing had snapped her out of it again
carried her to the bedroom
Im not leaving you again if the house burns down around our ears told her grimly
She smiled at me and rubbed her throat
Yes you are she said words coming painfully
Ill lock this window so no one can get in with out breaking the glass and lock the door
And Ill sit up in bed out of line of the window with your gun in my hands
Youve got to help the sheriff get this killer Jim Well she was right though hated to agree with her
And finally went out hearing the key scrape in the lock as she closed the door after me
went to the kitchen first
Old Strine lay on the floor as he had before
There was the knife handle protruding from his back with the slowly coagulating blood all around it
Dead as yesterdays mackerel
The knife handle sticking up proved that
went to the living room
Why the hell had Cook said hed seen Strine in the moonlight when that was utterly impossible
In the living room got the next shock out of night of crazy sur prises
Old Cook lay on divan with Schule and deputy and Corey Fitch all bending over him
The lawyers forehead was laid open and blood ran down his cheek smearing in his sparse sideburns
We found him in the living room doorway like this Schule said to me
The sheriff was completely lost now
What happened asked Cook
dont know His voice trem bled
sawthat horrible figure in the moonlight
Then the others ran past me out the door onto the grounds
didnt see it any more but heard step behind me
And then something hit me on the head and was through Howd the lights go out asked Schule He had an answer for that if he didnt for anything else
He held up pin
It was discolored and some of the point had melted off
It had been thrust into an electric cable causing short circuit
We found this in the dining room Schule said
blinked at that
In the dining room
remembered the proces sion that had crowded out after Cooks yell
The two deputies Corey Fitch and myself
Leaving two people in the dining room
Har riet and Ralph Packer
ACKER was in the living room with the rest of us
He sat in chair not far from the divan
stared at him suddenly and caught his closeset eyes just sliding from my face
Sweat stood out on his forehead
minute ago said slowly all of us ran out of the dining room except you and Miss Warner
Shortly afterward somebody came within hair of killing her Packer said nothing
His heavy breathing sounded out
You must have been in there when she was attacked said
No His voice was thick
It looks bad for me but wasnt
went out just after the rest of you did leaving Harriet aldne
My own niecesurely you dont think You could have come back in again said after youd blown the light fuse with that pin didnt
was in the living room Then snapped him up you must have seen the attack on Mr Cook Packer shivered
He wiped at his forehead but new drops of perspira tion came out at once
II couldnt see thingexcept Cook
saw him standing there in the doorway and then heard him scream and saw him fall
It was as if he had been struck by something invisible
By ghost You couldnt have been the one that hit him by any chance said
POPULAR DETECTIVE swear didnt Schule joined in
You were the one sent to find Arthur Fitch just before he was killed
You were out in back at about the time Strine was killed
You could have knocked Mr Cook out after youd blown the lights and then could have gone back into the dining room after Miss Warner No
No turned from Packer to the old lawyer lying on the divan
What in the world made you think you saw dead manGeorge Strinemoving out on the lawn He shook his head weakly
dont know
Maybe Id been think ing of Strine
When saw moving figure out there may have fitted Strines face to it because he was in my mind
And yet dont think thats the explanation
saw the face so clearly
even seemed to see aa knife handle sticking out of the mans back It couldnt have been me he saw Packer cut in swiftly
was in the dining room with you at that minute
You know that your self CHULE wiped his forehead which was almost as moist as Packers
Maybe Strine wasnt dead after all he muttered
We didnt feel for his pulse to find out
We took it for granted he was dead because of the knife
He might have had strength enough left to regain con sciousness crawl out to Hie lawn and then get back to the kitchen again Leaving no blood spots in his trail and not trying to call out for help snapped
No thats out
Its impossible All right Mr Cook didnt see Strine
guess that is kinda im possible
But he did see somebody
That means an outsider did all this
Somebody hiding on the grounds killed Strine and Arthur Fitch
And theyre probably miles away now But Cook objected
He shook his head winced at the pain the move caused dont think so Sheriff he said
There was something fa miliar about the figure
Ill agree that the notion that it was Strine saw is insane
But there was still something familiar about it in my opinion
Though thats only an opinion Schule sighed
Only one thing to be done
Ill have to take every body in till morning
The coroner might have some light to throw then He stopped abruptly
Wheres Corey Fitch he snapped
We all looked around
There were the two deputies Schule Packer Cook and myself in the room
He was here second ago said one of the deputies
He was sitting near the door Howd he get out with no one seeing him snapped Schule
That question answered itself
We had all been hanging on the words first of Packer and then of Cook
By moving softly Corey Fitch could have got from chair to door un noticed
The question in my mind was why had he moved so stealthily
And on the heels of that question came lightning burst of fear
Fear for Harriet
jumped to my feet and tore from the room
The room in which Harriet lay was at the end of the short hall
pounded on the door almost yelled with relief when heard her voice come in alarm Who is it MeJim said
wanted to be sure you were all right heard Schules voice then
You Fitch
What the hell are you doing out here The voice came from the kitchen
went there
Corey Fitch white faced was staring at Schule and the deputies
He was standing be side Strines body and there was little blood on his hands
What are you doing here Fitch stared at Schule and then at me
With all the talk about seeing Strine came out to see if he was really dead
had crazy notion that maybe he was just pretending DEATH IN COTTAGE to be dead with fake knife handle glued to his back and blood from butcher shop or something spilled on the floor to make it look con vincing Schules snort was an indictment
Thats swell explana tion Its the truth
Mr Cook seemed so positive he saw Strine Why did you sneak out here without saying anything The idea was sort of crazy Fitch said stubbornly
thought youd laugh at me if suggested it
So slipped out by myself to make sure he was dead Howd you get that blood on your hands took hold of the knife handle to see if it was really attached to knife blade Fitchs face got paler yet
It is
Strine is dead all right You took hold of the knife han dle Schule grated
What swell excuse for finding your prints on that handle
You didnt have time to wipe em off the handle after you killed Strine so you tried an alibi Damn you Fitch began
And then the last act of the swift drama hit us as we confronted Fitch in the kitchen
Oh my God came shout from the living room
Help CHAPTER IV Dead Men Dance GHTING to get through an all too narrow doorway once more that night we ran from room on each others heels
We got to the living room
was first with Schule close enough behind to see over my shoulder as we reached the living room doorway
Cook and Packer were swaying in deadly struggle in the center of the room
chair was knocked over nearby
The chair Packer had been sitting in when we left
Cook had his arms desperately around Packers body
The arms were striving to pinion Packers arms to his sides while with his right hand Cook held the wrist of the heavier man in tense grip
The briefest possible glimpse we had of the two swaying figures
Then as we crossed the threshold the two men fell
They fell with Packer on his back and Cook on top
Packers arm continued to be bent at grotesque angle behind him
And he did not move
Cook crawled off looking white and sick
There was blood on his right hand which he drew from under Packers body
My God he whispered
He turned the body over little
We saw the handle of paper knife sticking out of Packers back
Cook moaned
Ive killed him The lawyer picked at loose lips with trembling fingers
He cowered back from us
didnt mean to do it
He came at me with knife
twisted his arm behind him
He was getting the best of me when tripped him
He fell on the knife he held in his own hand
It wasnt me Schule touched his shoulder
Youre all right he said gruffly
Youve got plenty of witnesses that it was self defense and that you didnt have the knife in your hand
It was self defense Yes babbled Cook
Self de fense
An accident
You saw said nothing
looked at Bruce Cooks left coat sleeve
On the sleeve there was faint smear of white
And the white smear was telling me all had wanted to know
Piece by piece the whole thing was fitting into shape now
Schule glared down at Ralph Packer
Got no more than he deserved
Killed two people
Youre damned lucky he didnt get you too Mr Cook
Anyhow the case is washed up
The murderers dead whichll save the State the cost of putting him in the chair No said looking at the streak POPULAR DETECTIVE on Cooks sleeve
Whitewash it was
The murderer isnt dead
Hes standing here now jittering around about self defense What are you talking about panted Cook apparently recovering strength slowly from the battle for his life
Youre screwy snapped Sehule
We all saw how Packer was trying to stab Cook Yeah said
For how long
For about fifth of second
Then Cook tripped Packer and Packer fell back on his own knife
Oblig ing guy Packer Cook was staring at me with as tonishment and sort of patient in jury in his eyes
dont quite understand Mr Tevin he said
was attacked by the man as though he had sud denly gone mad
managed to beat him off and we fell and he was killed by the very weapon he had meant to use on me Interesting said
But that doesnt explain the streak of white wash on your sleeve LOOKED at his sleeve with nothing but bewilderment in his face
Then stared questioningly at me again
It was damned well done
You were outside this room while the rest of us were in the kitchen charged him
You brushed against one of these freshly whitewashed walls outside Your attitude is insulting and unwarranted sir
may have had this streak of white on my sleeve since first arrived here You may have cut him off but you didnt
It wasnt on there five minutes ago
Which means you went out within the last few min utes
Was it before you killed Packer or afterward But my dear sir you saw Packer killedaccidentallya few seconds ago We saw you dancing around with him
But we didnt see Packer killed shot out
thought there was something funny about the way his knees were buckling
Packer teas dead before he fell
Youd have had to kill him before you went out of the house or hed have asked questions or raised an outcry
You put on an act with dead man Cook Cook turned to Sehule
Sheriff is this man authorized to attack me in this absurd way No he aint Sehule growled
He switched his eyes to me
Back out of this Shut up told him
returned to Cook
There is something of value hidden around this property now belonging to Harriet Warner
As Rudolph Packers lawyer you knew of it
You tried to kill Miss Warner so the house would be un tenanted and you could steal it
She was lucky enough to escape your first attack down in the city
stopped the second
We all came up here tonight
The first thing you were greeted with was an indication that old Strine knew the secret too though he didnt know you were in on it
You killed Strine to shut him up
Arthur Fitch you discovered saw something to make him little sus picious
Probably he saw you either enter or leave the kitchen just be fore the will was read
Sheriff Sehule was going to question him second time because the first time Arthur Fitch had acted as if he had something on his mind You spiked that by racing to the garage when you saw him walk out onto the lawn and getting hammer with which you later killed him Cook was shaking his head al most pityingly
And the pin that caused the short circuit he murmured
That was found in the dining room
At the time it was dropping was lying in here unconscious Thats what you say
Actually you werent at all
You caused the short while you stood in the living room after the rest had run past you and out the door
Packer came out then and you put on an act for him pretended to be attacked and droppedafter carefully gashing your own head
Packer couldnt see you at the floor level in the dark DEATH IN COTTAGE and didnt see you crawl to the dark dining room lock it from the inside and then attack Miss Warner once more after dropping the fused pin as plant CHULE was staring atCook lit tle more uncertainly now and little less angrily at me
You made up the silly yarn about seeing Strine in the yard to distract our attention so you could have one more chance to kill the inheritor of this house told the lawyer
At the moment it seemed like good idea
Later you began to realize that it might draw suspicion to you
So you planned goat
You killed Packer while his back was turned
You ran out into the night ran back in again and put on the cockeyed act we caught glimpse of as we ran here in answer to your yell And why would go outside the house at such tense moment demanded Cook with sneer
Because of the thing of value hidden here which has been youi motive from the first shot back
Obviously this thing is somehow part of the outside house wall which explains the immaculate whitewash put on carefully to cover the object
Now it seems to me your anxiety to rush things which led you to the terrific risk of doing murder while law officer was right in the house can only mean that this valuable thing is in danger of becoming visible
Maybe the white wash is coming off from over it
dont know
Yes thats probably it
And you ran out after killing Packer to try to cover it up so you could have at least few days more in which to get Miss Warner out of the way and steal it Cook sighed
should be very angry young man
But Im not be cause fortunately you cant harass me with your insane theories
You all saw me fighting for my life with man who attacked me for no reason the man who is the real murderer
Schule at least will tes tify to that extent
So think you are to be disregarded Mr Tevin Schule looked at the lawyer and then at me
Got any way to prove what youre spouting about
he chal lenged me
grinned little at that
Id been angling for the question
The whole case said rests on the fact that theres something around this place Which Miss War ner has inherited that is worth lot of money and that Cook alone knows of it and has killed to get it
Right Yeah or youre crazy Schule grunted
Now if we can go out side find the part of the wall where Cook picked up that smear of white wash and discover something of value there it would hang him wouldnt it Its an idea said Schule strid ing for the door
Wait Cook cracked out
Schule and turned
He had looked con temptuous before
Now he looked damned mad
His eyes were hard glitters in his face
The veins in his forehead stood out
demand my rights Sheriff
It may be remotely possible that thi man has chanced to guess an amaz ing truth that there is something valuable concealed here
But if that is so it would prove not one thing The hell it wouldnt said Schule
Come on Tevin We got to the door
Cook came after us
He moved fast for man who had been hit in the head lit tle while before
tell you Sheriff Schule ignored him
We moved down the wall
To the left to the right
Cook came with us talking clutching first at Schules arm and then at mine
Long before we came to the end of the search Schule had glanced meaningly at the two dep uties who closed in behind the law yer
And to the right near the cor ner of the house we saw dis coloration in the gleaming white wash
It was little patch of dried mud no larger than silver dollar reached to scratch at the mud
POPULAR DETECTIVE And Cook cracked
scream like that of an animal came from his lips
He lunged toward the two deputies then stopped
saw his face congest with the dreadful apoplexy of stroke and he fell Later that night we got back to the mud patch
We scraped it away and some of the whitewash around it
The Cape Cod cottage was con structed of brick
But right here was slab of gold as thick as brick and ten bricks in area
When the gold moratorium had gone into effect Rudolph Packer had secretly bought some and cast it into this ponderous slab
He had put it there in the wall which every one passing could see but had ruled bricklines in it and had washed it over with whitewash with which he kept the cottage meticulously covered from then on
The only man besides Strine to know of it was Cook who had been instructed to inform Har riet of its presence when in future years it was once more legal to own gold
Cook had planned to kill Harriet so he could loot the gold from an uninhabited house
The sheer weight of the slab made it impossible for him to cart it off alone during normal short absence of hers or of Strines
When he had come in that night he had been horrified to see that bit of whitewash had flaked off the glittering slab
And at the end of his murder spree he had rushed out to rub skim of mud over the metal getting the whitewash that damned him on his sleeve
Harriet wanted to give me tenth of the slab for my fee
Nothing doing said
Why should take tenth when Ive got shot at the whole thing You think you have chance at it she murmured
Why not said
Youre pretty well fixed now
You need detec tive in the family to watch over your interests and keep you from being lonely out in this nice cot tage She looked at me for full min ute
Swell eyes
It would serve you right if took you seriously she said at last
We were under the moon
took her hand
Go on said little thickly serve me right guess my voice told her how far was from kidding
Anywayshe did

HE girl had been crying
There were no streaks on her face for she had done good job with her powderpuff
But her eyes were red they were good eyes toowide and frank and deep blue
Her ankles were slim and thats criterion with me
Faces run pretty much alike nowadays what with facials and mudpacks and electric vibrators but never saw ankles like hers on anything but thorough breds
Speck Chandler talked to her his homely freckled face as kindly as the face of bulldog can be
She was pulling at the fingertips of her gloves but she looked straight at us
It was up in our office in the Federal Building which has on the frosted glass of the door Narcotic Squad Agent in Charge David Chandler My name is Julia Proctor the girl said
live in Fenway hun POPULAR DETECTIVE dred miles south of here
Itsits about my brothermy kid brother
Hes just seventeen
Im working in Fenway to send him to high school
Wewere orphans
Jimmy has been brilliant student
Worked too hard think
Then he got to where hed come home in hilarious mood
Hed laugh and singand say that the most ordinary thingslike electric lightswere the most beautiful things in the world
And then it would only be little while before hed be sunk in the depths of despairactually groveling in despondency She shuddered
His grades fell off at school
He looked haggard and kept wanting more money
It frightened me
caught him smok ing cigarettesa brand Id never heard of
So watched him one day when school turned out
There was swarthy man parked in coupe about block from school
Several boys went to his car he slipped them something and they gave him money The girls honest gaze was direct
II dont want Jimmy to get into any trouble
Butbut want to break up this awful thing whatever it is
took this out of Jimmys clothes HE handed Speck crumpled pack with few cigarettes in it
It was labeled Smokeys Speck broke open one of the fags riffled its contents in his palm sniffed it then handed the whole business to me
He took the girls arm steered her to the door
Will you wait in the lobby Miss Proctor he said
left the office by rear door
We have enough of lab back there to lift and read fingerprints and enough of file to check against the main ones
It all didnt take over three or four minutes
steely glint was in Specks eyes when returned to the office
Heavenly weed cracked
With its roots in hell Speck finished
And neither of us smiled when we said it
Marijuana is no smiling matter
Four sets of prints on the pack said
Probably the girls yours and the kid brothers
The other set is Honey Savonis That means Nick Dariant Speck said
Honey has always been Dariant manpeddling everywhere but working specially among high school kidsbuilding up hellish busi ness for the future Specks face was more like bulldogs right then than ever
The image of Nick Dariant was in my mind
Nick Dariant the man we wanted the Number One man on the divisions list
man with the figure of marathon runner the classic face of screen loverand soul as black as the pit of hell
He had taken powder in Chicago when narcotic agents had closed in on his gang and hideout
He had done the same in Saint Louis
Ditto Los Angeles
most slippery cus tomer Mr Dariant
In those other places it had been hasheesh and bhang
Down here it was marijuana probably the most insidious and hell ish of them all
Wherever he oper ated Nick Dariant had cleaned up wad and left few thousand wrecked lives behind him
Wed had other evidence that Dari ant was at work in our vicinity
Here in the city we had picked up and convicted half dozen addicts and small time peddlers we knew were Dariant menor women
We had nailed down the town pretty tight
That was why Dariant men were working in the smaller places like Fenway
But we hadnt been able to learn where Dariant was or how he was getting the stuff
We knew that he wasnt fooling around with win dowboxes and backyard gardens
He never operated on twobit scale
This is the best lead weve had Dinkey Davis Speck said
They call me Dinkey maybe because Im sort of short and squat which had come in handy because before came into the division was flashy shortstop on Class baseball team with an exmarine sergeant for captain
He HEAVENLY WEED gave me the nameand it had stuck ever since
told Miss Proctor an agent would go to Fenway with her Speck went on
We may learn some thing from her brother
And besides the girl may need protection Dari ants hoods might be watching her
Dariant always works big crew and hes still got some of his old gang left
Theyre mean bunch of rats Protection for ladies said
Thats right up my alley Maybe was thinking about the girls ankles
put on my hat and began to look around to see what Id want to take with me
Speck put hand like bunch of bananas in my face and pushed me back into my chair
No sentiment in this business he growled
saw you looking at that girl
Im going griped but it didnt do any good
That AgentinCharge business means what it says
Phone Fanny for me Speck said whenhe left with the girl lit tle later
Tell her Ill be back on the train tonight about seven
If dont make it Ill phone you One of the first rules of an agent is to keep in contact with his head quarters
Thats to keep from get ting out on limb and then finding it sawed off behind you
Speck didnt come in that night and he didnt phone
Fanny called me the next morning and said that Speck hadnt come in during the night
Of course she was scared but Fanny is game and didnt show it except for little choke in her voice
That day wasnt much fun for me
Fanny would phone about every two hours the choke in her voice getting little more noticeable each time
And no word came from Speck
put in call for him at Fenway and couldnt get him
Then put in call for Julia Proctor and couldnt get her either
Hell surely be in tonight Fanny said bravely the last time she called
Im having whitefish for dinner to nightbroiled the way Dave is crazy about
Come on out and eat with us We ate the whitefish aloneFanny and and the two kids
Speck didnt show up and Im afraid we didnt enjoy the dinner good as it was
sat around faking cheerfulness for couple of hours with the kids crawl ing over me and calling me Uncle Dinkey The boy is four and looks so much like Speck its spooky the girl six looks like Fanny which is plenty goodlooking
It made my stomach go cold those kids talking about their daddy and asking when he was coming home and Fanny go ing kind of white every time Specks name was mentioned
When left she went to the door with me
She kind of reached out caught both my arms tight and be gan to cry
let her use my shoul der
Im crazy about Fanny
Shes swell people
told her to keep her chin upthen got out of there
had to or Id have been blubbering too
got in my car and headed south
ENWAY is nice little town with Chamber of Commerce and all the trimmings
At one oclock in the morning it was blot of dark ness with the exception of two blocks of street lights and the lights in front of the new courthouse
got the directions to Julia Proctors house from bent and toothless old night watchman
It was pocketsize cottage with vines around it
It seemed to fit her all rightand verify my judgment on her ankles
It was dark of course
walked around the cottage
And didnt go clanking
couldnt spot anything queer
Finally went up and tried the front door
It was locked
rang the bell thinking it kind of foolish
had funny feel ing down under my breastbone
Maybe was sticking my neck out
The lock clicked the door came open with jerk and the lights snapped on
had yanked out my POPULAR DETECTIVE service gun but the man who opened the door had jumped to one side
The door slammed behind me and its spring lock clicked
Take it easy copper Honey Sa voni said
We was kinda expectin you All could see of Honey was one eye half of crooked nose and half of his grinning gash of mouth
The rest of him was behind the casement of the doorway down the hall
But saw what Honey had
It was tommygun and it was pointed just about where had recently experi enced my funny feeling
We found out long time ago Honey cracked that Federal dicks run in pairslike other snakes
All right take him Sailor Thats where Honey made his mis take
When theyre going to take me they ought not to let me know about it
learned in Class baseball how all at the same time to dodge popbottles from the visiting fans fight the umps with one hand and members of the visiting team with the other
Ive often used that tech nique
This time dodged
The sap that Sailor Pringle swung down at me would have knocked me cold as welldiggers foot
It didnt even do my shoulder any good when jerked my head aside
Sailor was the punk who had opened the door
He used to be thirdrate pug before he got the killers itch
HE momentum of his blow threw Sailor onto my back let my gun slip whipped my hands over the back of his neck locked my fingers hunched low and heaved up like bucking burro
Honey didnt use the tommygun to open up my hide for two reasonsone was in our tangle Sailor Pringle was as likely to be come bloody corpse as me the other was they didnt want four alarm bedlam in this quiet burg
My heave did the work for Sailor
With cry like frightened guinea hen he went over my back and slammed down in front of me
didnt let him go to the floor
grabbed new hold and held him up in front of me his back to Honey and the artillery
Fire when ready Honey yam mered
See if Sailor can take it Sailor couldnt
He squirmed like worm on hot rock bawling out for Honey not to shoot
But Sailor still had some of the stuff he had in the fight ring and he began to fight back
And Honey Savoni was clos ing incautiously because Honey likes himselfbut closing in never theless
And the ruckus brought two more of the rats from the room off the hall
knew all of them
Not person ally of course
Their mugs were on file in the division
The last two were Skeet Filmore thinfaced little rat with buckteeth and Fats Googan beefy one with tic that made his mouth twitch
All four were Nick Dariant trigger men
Both newcom ers had rods and Skeets had muf fler on it
figured when they got ready to kill meand it looked like that time was coming on Skeet would be delegated to do the job
was fighting nasty
My knee had found Sailors groin one fist in his face and the other in his stomach below the belt
Which doesnt mean that Sailor wasnt doing anything about it
My chin had found his fist three or four timesI lost count and was as groggy as gob on shore leave
But Sailor was plenty sick and made wild swing that caught him flush on the button and sent him reeling staggering away to flounder blindly into the wall and slump down
The others were right on me then and had to shake my head hard to keep the hallway itself from jumping up and down
was thinking that girl with nice ankles had let me in for this
Let me drop this copper Skeet Fillmore wheezed through his nose
His gun with the awkwardlooking muffler was shoved against my teeth
He had been smoking up his own profits could smell the weed on his breath and see the ugly shine of his eyes
HEAVENLY WEEDS How did it dont know
Again the practice from dodging popbot tles guess
Skeet just didnt pull the trigger fast enough
My hand slapped up whacked against the gun
It coughed in my face parted my hair neatly in the middle and powder burned my forehead
had sense enough to know that an automatic with that kind of muffler had to be cocked between shots
While our misguided Mr Fill more was trying to do that hit him
The blow cracked like cap pistol and his head went way back
Skeet went over sank flat on the floor lay still
ONEY SAVONI was cursing fer vently he hit me over my ear with the muzzle of the tommygun
slogged to my knees and couldnt get up
Honey drew back for finishing blow but Fats Googan caught his arm
Everything stopped in that hall way like moving picture when the film breaks
Somebody was pounding on the door
Open up
Open up The lawthe hick law Fats whispered hoarsely his mouth jerk ing hard
Scram Honey cried
They were leaving and couldnt get up
My elbows kept folding un der my weight
Sailor Pringle was going too yawing behind them in zigzag trail
Then hefty body hit the front door and it cracked heav ing in couple of big cops in Tooner ville uniforms
Halt called one of the cops
He had big round face and he raised big heavy black gun
But Sailor didnt halt and the others were al ready through the back door of the hall
The cops jumped over me and Skeet Fillmore on the floor and went rushing after them
Doors slammed and then the big guns started off
heard Honeys tommy chattering wild and devilish out there
Then car roared
was surprised to see the cops come back in both as good as new
Luck of the Irish guess
They got away one said dole fully
Whats all this the other de manded
Im trying to find out mum bled and managed to show them my badge
The watchman told us you asked the way to Miss Julias the red faced one said
We didnt like the looks of it this time of night so we came out
Im glad you didyou saved my life One of the cops had drink on him and he offered it to me
It brought me around
They found sur gical tape in the house and patched the places where Id had the corners knocked off my skull
went over and took look at Skeet Fillmore
He was dead
Thats the trouble with longtime addict
Life hangs by such slender thread with them
little sock and out goes his heart
And was genuinely sorry because dead man cant talk
They took Skeets body away with them and said theyd phone in an alarm to go on the shortwave
let it go at that
What wanted what the division wanted was the hide of the devil behind all this Nick Dariant
Honey Savoni wouldnt lead us to him as long as he was chased
In the living room of Julia Proc tors cottage flopped in an arm chair and searched around
started putting two and two together and got hatful of things didnt like
The girl had been watched just as Speck had guessed
Perhaps the kid brother had sung to Savoni
Then Speck had stepped into the buzzsaw just as had
The Savoni mob had taken him the girl and the boy Jimmy
They had come back to sit on the cottage like hen on nest of eggs
And smart guy had walked into their parlor
went over the house with fine toothed comb
No soap
Back in the living room searched around some more
Two demons were beating tin pans in my head
POPULAR DETECTIVE Then saw book lying open face down on the mantle
That book meant something
Sa vonis mob would not have been read ing Oliver Twist
Either Julia Proc tor or Speck Chandler had left the volume there
If it was Speck thered be some message about it for me
marked the place where the book was open and put it through an examina tion
At last got it There were tiny indentations such as might have been made by fingernailunder certain letters of the reading matter
Grabbing pen cil searching those faint marks out with acute care wrote down the letters
farmeightmilesnmilstead Farm eight miles north of Mil stead
could reconstruct what had happened here
The gang had held Speck here probably waiting for chance to move him out
He heard them talk knew where they were go ing to take him
When they were not watching too closely he had left this message
Milstead was seventy miles north west of Fenway hamlet on the highway
called Fanny by long dis tance and told her had lead and was going right on after Speck
But didnt tell her that Nick Dariants favorite method was spray of ma chinegun bullets in the face and in terment in limepit
noon the next day was up pole literally
Linemans climb ing spikes were strapped to my legs safetybelt encircled my waist and the pole and through binoculars was studying farm quartermile away
This wasnt the first pole had climbed nor the first farm had studied through the glasses
There were bunch of farms eight miles north of Milstead and hadnt passed up bet
This one at casual glance looked like all others in the vicinity
But big section at the rear of it was bordered on all sides by thick bois darc hedge and in that section was growing brand of cotton no cotton farmer would ac knowledge
It was growing lush thick and broadcast instead of in rows
Under my glass it had long downslanting ladyfinger leaves
Mexican hempthe marijuana plant
Here then was Nick Dariants supply of the weed
Roughly cal culated he had about half million dollars worth of it on the stem enough to ruin the lives of the popu lation of city
About the time had that thought one of the glass insulators about eighteen inches from my face ex ploded
Chips of glass cut my face bullet screamed away like ban shee and across from the big mod ern twostory farmhouse came the sound of gun
whipped my glasses that way and saw the figure of man in one of the upper windows
His rifle winked again and long raw splinter ripped off the crossarm to which was holding
Jerking my spikes free wrapping arms about the pole began to slide down
The bullets followed me
They made ugly notches on the pole right at my face
One breezed through my clothes with hot breath scraping my hide at the waist
Other guns be gan booming closerhoods in the bois darc hedge who had been guard ing the marijuana field
And saw car put out from the house
was slipping as fast as could without letting go entirely
was about half way down when bullet cut the safetybelt and gravity did the job of getting me to the ground
It was shocking jar but no bones broke
got up running
The car was racing along narrow lane and would be here in seconds
There were five men in it and saw machine gun poking out the rear window
was in timbered pasture land ducking among bushes and low brush
And right there pulled little trick of psychology on them
knew theyd expect me to run away from danger so ran toward it
My car was in the other direction but had brought up carryingcase with my equip HEAVENLY WEED ment in it and cached it not far from my lookout pole
Men had left the car and were running through the pasture
Honey Savoni had the machinegun
Fats Googan had thirtyshot Luger
The others were as well heeled
They were getting closer and closer
They were as wary as lynxcats
Behind bush shed the linemans doodads strip ping for speed
Ill bet the rat run the other way Fats cried out
tumbled into shallow depres sion with some weeds along its sides
scuttled along on all fours going toward the lane until was just op posite the clump where my stuff was cached
But there was open space between it and me
The chance had to be taken
sprinted up and ran for it putting on all my steam
Honey Savoni yelled
His tommy began its insane jabber
heel was knocked from my shoe
saw pieces of ground eaten away in front of me
That brush clump was the home plate and slid into it like runner in the last of the ninth with the score tied
Thorns clawed at me but hardly knew it
grabbed up the carryingcase with my left hand and plunged out of the bushes on the other side
Right across from me was the gangs car parked in the lane
hood was standing by it on guard with big automatic in his hand
He had seen me coming had his gun up
My own was up too
shot him in the chest just as his gun went off and his bullet zipped by my head
That cured him permanently of the gang killers favorite trickshooting at his victims face
The motor of the car was still go ing and Savonis mad crew was still coming like pack of hounds
pushed the dead man from the run ning board and leaped in under the wheel
It was big heavy car with thick nonshatterable glassalmost an armored car
made tank out of that car
didnt go back down the lane because that way they would cut me off lit erally rip the tires off of it with their guns
whirled the machine halfway around and headed straight into wire fence
Wires snapped like fiddle strings and roared across rows of cotton straight for the house
The machine cut through the plants like scythe
While drove with my left hand opened the case beside me with my right and took out the submachinegun
Guns opened up from the house
Spider webs appeared on the wind shield
Bullets beat like sharp ham mers on the body
And gun noises were driving me on from behind
RIPPED through another wire fence hurdled ditch and roared across gravel lane that bordered the grounds of the house
Then was facing sturdy white paling fence
The car hit it with crash made hole in it slapped the fence to the ground for twenty feet on each side
The grounds of the house were nicely landscaped with dwarf cedars and firs
The car took these in its stride Slicing down tall graceful Lombardy poplar for extra measure
couldnt stop and get outit was raining lead and had no umbrella
There was tiled sun porch on this side of the house just about level with the yard
drove straight at it
It had two thick brick columns but gunned the machine to the floor thought could drive between them
did but left rear fenders behind
Looking out on the sun porch was big wide cathedral window reach ing to the floor
Again gunned to the bottom hit the window center
Glass metal framework mortar crashed around me like all hell
There was twofoot drop beyond the window and the car leaped in like some live devil from hopheads dream
There it came to halt astride studio couch with its nose hooked over library table
On the other side of the room was an open archway with double col umns on each side of it
man was behind the right side columns with the nose of machinegun poked be POPULAR DETECTIVE tween them belching fire and death at me
The bedlam was hideous
flopped down below the dash as the windshield was eaten away and fell in stiards on my back
wormed to the floor with the gear lever press ing my stomach and reached across to the handle of the righthand door
When it swung open went out with it dragging the machinegun
Glass shattered out of the door as the gunner spotted my move
But crouched low behind the side of the hood low enough to have the protection of the heavy metal of the motor from which bullets were gonging like demons beating tri angle
More men had come down the stairs beyond the archway their rods joining the hellish din
raised my tommy just above the engine hood got lightning bead between those two columns squeezed trigger
The gun bucked and jumped in my hands
The man with the chopper neighed out like stricken horseonce then he and his gun disappeared from the niche
The artillery on the stairs behind him backed up beat retreat turn ing to flee the steps
They couldnt take it
Seeing their man die in bloody mess like that broke their nerve
Maybe sensed thisI dont know
went on because couldnt go back
hit the bottom step the last of the rats above was quitting the landing
He tried to fire down on me
He wasnt fast enough
My spray of bullets carried away half his side and he came tumbling down the stairs lump of dying flesh
was little sick from the car nage but was little crazy too
When reached the top of the stairs was cocked for more of it
But came face to face with three thugs who had dropped their weapons and had their hands high
It was pretty brutal
But couldnt take chance on their treachery and didnt have time to tie them up
socked themone two threeon the conk with the barrel of the tommy
After had kicked their weapons through the bannister to clatter down the stairs ran on down the corridor
Some one was shouting
knew it was Speck Chandler and my heart leaped high with joy
window was open at the end of the corridor and looked out
The four men were running across the yard skirting around fish pond
Honey was in the lead gripping his tommygun
aimed my own at their feet intending to plow up the ground in front of them as warn ing
Nothing happened
The drum was empty
And had left my service revolver in the wrecked car
didnt thinkI might have wilted
had to bluff it take the chance
All right Honeyall of you
Drop your guns and reach or take lead on tender places yelled
To man they looked up
Saw my chopper beaded on them
There was motionless moment
Ill never forget their white faces upturned toward me
That nerve in Fats face jerking at the corner of his mouth Honeys gash of mouth slack in surprise the others blank
Honey made half gesture to raise his weapon when Fats Googan babbled curse and threw down his gun
Then Honey let go of his and the others followed suit
Kick them in the fishpond ordered
They obeyed while watched
Then turned away
Their fangs were drawn there is no danger in gangster when his gun is gone
They might lam but knew they could be picked up as soon as phoned in an alarm
listened now to Speck Chand lers shouting
Dinkey Dinkey he yelled
Look out for Nick Nick Dariant
How would look out for him
How had craved to come face to face with him
Now good luck or bad luck with me wouldand with gun
But traced the sound of Specks voice ranged down from the corri HEAVENLY WEED dor
spotted it behind the third door
The door was locked
lunged against the door and broke it open
But no shots bombs or other forms of destruction greeted me
Instead was looking into very nicely furnished room where Speck Chandler Julia Proctor and her kid brother sat rigidly in chairs
They were taped to them like so many mummies
Nick Dariant was not in the room
When Id freed them Speck sheepishly tried to say something appropriate the girl was crying from reaction and hugging her brother who was manly looking little chap after all
Then she was hugging me and she kissed me
liked it all right but didnt want to go soft then
UT IT growled
Weve got to get Nick We went out of the room into the corridor
We kept together
didnt tell Speck and the others my gun was empty
We tried doors
They were locked and was tired of crashing things
Then voice sounded from the other end of the long hallway
All right Gcoppers
Youve ruined my hideout busted my racket havent you
Take this from Nick Dariant as little token whirled and saw Nick
Just glimpse of him
His matinee idol figure his Greek god face eyes crazy now classic features in twisted cast of fury
Then he raised his right arm and threw with all his mighta bomb
saw that bomb coming on and on growing bigger for what seemed like hours
We were all huddled together at the end of the hallway we couldnt run we were hemmed in by walls and locked doors
It wasnt standard bomb but hand manufactured one round and about the size of baseball it made me sick inside to think what that much highexplosive could do to us
It came on like groundliner and realized that it was going to hit the floor and skim along to our very feet
must have thought wasnt in that hall any more
was on the baseball diamond and maybe could hear the fans yelling what Id gone through made me little berserk
That bomb was baseball fast groundskinner coming at me redhot from the smash of bat and was racing to meet it to pick it up
caught it as it hit the floor
didnt know until long time later that bone in my hand was cracked
My hand lashed up and returned it hot as it had comeputting all the steam had on that return
Nick Dariant saw it coming but he seemed paralyzed couldnt move
Then there was an awful growl of sound in our ears the house shook and Nick was blotted from sight by jagged blast of flame
There was hole in the wall hole in the floor and plaster and lath ripped out and fell
And somewhere in that debris was what was left of Nick Dariant
It was funny that Id think right then of Speck Chandlers wife wait ing by the telephone and the two kids who had crawled over me the night before asking about their daddy
You go phone Fanny this min ute you big lug said roughly to Speck
Then went blind as bat and reeled over
When came to was stretched out flat on couch in one of the rooms and the girl was bending over me
could see her ankles and they were as trim as ever
knew Id been right about those ankles
tried to grin
Ill give Jimmy whipping down if ever catch him smoking off brand cigarettes again said
How about date tonight lady She bent closer and maybe Im crazy but thought there were tears in her eyes and she seemed like she couldnt speak for moment
And she kind of choked up when she spoke
What time shall expect you
Mr Davis she said
MURDERERS THE midforties of New York City not far from Fifth Ave nue stands the huge building which houses the Scientific Crime Club
The clubs luxurious quarters are on the roof far removed from the turmoil of busy city streets
There is little garden of pebbled winding paths between flower beds and trellises with splashing foun tain in its center
One of the rooms has sliding walls and roof which in pleasant weather may be opened to the sky
And there are other rooms of luxurious leather lounging chairs little bar and restaurant with whitecoated atten dants
Bridge and chess tables are here billiard room small bowling alley shooting gallery small gymnasium and pool
Outwardly they are rooms for wealthy men at play
But some of them are very strangely equipped
One is crowded with expensive de vices of modern science an electri cal laboratory room equipped for research chemistry and physics
And there is room which would seem to be theatrical storehouse scenery props of every imaginable kind ranged in an orderly litter
They are the clubs equipment when it is at work
No one visiting the club for the first time would think of it as more than playground
But the lighting effects of its rooms can be made extraordinary for they have wiring as intricate as any theatrical stage
There are ingenious secret panels in some of the walls hidden traps in the floor and the roofan amazing equipment which may not be used for year but is always available By RAY Author of The Mental Giant for the scientific probing of the minds of suspected criminals who may be brought here
The club members largely are wealthy professional men
Upon warm summer night group of them were gathered in one of the lounging rooms
Some club members were here by chance others had been summoned as spectators and participants in case which just today had come be fore the club
The services of the members Dr Allaire Plumbs the Depths of Killers BRAIN didnt do itl KING Condemned by Fate etc
the resources of the clubhave for years been at the disposal of the police or any individual who cares to demand them
The cases come at irregular in tervals generally from the police of New York City and its out lying districts clueless affairs usually with definite suspects upon whom by ordinary police methods guilt would probably never be fast ened
The case tonight was typical
The Psychologist lounging in his Tale from the SCIENTIFIC CRIME CLUB chair with his fellow members around him was saying Its pathetic affair gentlemen
The girlshe was only sixteen killed herself last evening
And per haps almost simultaneously her father was murdered How do you know she killed her self the Banker demanded
Why not double murder The facts are against it the Psychologist said
The thing hap pened in Maple Grovejust about this time last evening
Peter Mack enzie and his daughter Alice
They lived in small but very respectable lodging house
He was widower glass blower in the Torrence Glass Works out there
And the girl kept house for him QfHE took poison understand the Doctor interjected
Why asked the Very Young Man eagerly
Was she pretty girl Dr Allaire They say she was the Psycholo gist answered
An oldfashioned sort of girl
Her father brought her here from Scotland just after she was born
The father was man of fifty
You know the typeindus trious thrifty squarely solid both in physical build and in character
plain man of doggedly high prin ciples
And he brought his daughter up in just that fashion
They say the girl was dutiful gentle sweet And she killed herself the Very Young Man sighed
wish had known her
Maybe then At nine oclock last evening the Psychologist went on Peter Mackenzie is known to have gone out and left his daughter at home
They were both agitatedthe land lady heard their voices but nothing that they said
At ten oclock she went up to see Alice
The girl was Mind to Secure Halting Confession
POPULAR DETECTIVE lying on her bed unconscious from an overdose of sedative
She never recovered consciousness she died at dawn today
And last nightat ninethirty while the girl was end ing her lifeless than two miles away her father was being mur dered And there is clear connection the Lawyer asked
There is indeed The grey haired distinguishedlooking Psy chologist sat up in his chair smooth ing crumpled bit of paper in his hand
Here is the note she left pathetic simple words
He read Father darling He doesnt love me so why bother
hope you tell him so
But even as much as love you cannot live without him
Oh please forgive me HERE was brief silence the men staring at the Psychologist put the smudged tearstained bit of paper back into his pocket
Then the Lawyer said It sems obvious that her father went to meet the man she loved Exactly the Psychologist agreed
That inference is plain
They met
And the unknown man killed Mack enzieon bridge high over the Central Railroad tracks in the out skirts of Maple Grove
We have witness to it
The train for New York had just left the Maple Grove station
It wasnt going very fast when it reached the bridge
The engineer plainly saw two men high up there the silhouettes of them
He saw the murderer shoving Mackenzie and saw Mackenzie come hurtling downstriking not the track on which the train was advancing but the one adjacent
The fall killed him
The murderer perhaps had in tended to throw him in front of the train If the engineer saw the mur derer what did he look like the Lawyer demanded
Just bareheaded silhouette
No details
The silhouette of man peering dpwn then running away
Now gentlemen you can see easily why Marberry of Maple Grove re ferred the case to us
This man whom the little Alice loved more than her father or her lifeonly she and her father knew his iden tity
And there you have the mur der motive
This stern old Scotch man meeting this man The murderer felt that he could control the girl the Astronomer suggested
Or perhaps he would have mur dered her later the Psychologist said
Her suicide saved him the trouble
The case gentlemen by in ference is extraordinarily simple
But that indeed is exactly why the police are balked
There are no tangible clues
Nothing but infer encean assumption of what hap pened and why it happened Which wouldnt get very far be fore jury the Lawyer interjected
Defense counsel would knock that sort of evidence into cocked hat Exactly the Psychologist agreed
We have the suspectsand nothing else
It wasnthard even in few short hours today for Marberry to locate the possible men for whom Alice Mackenzie could have had this attachment
There are only two
young fellow named George Bolton who works in an office here in New York and rich widower of thirty an exactor named Thomas Dale who was fortunate in mining speculation and now has retired from business
Both were seen fre quently in the girls companyold Mackenzie seemed to like them both And where were they last eve ning the Lawyer demanded
The Psychologist smiled wryly
Marberry has been grilling them all day
Young Bolton was in his Maple Grove boarding house room on the ground floor so that he could easily have gone in and out the window without attracting atten tion
Thomas Dale was alone in his Maple Grove apartment with pri vate entrance to the street so that no one but himself can say whether he was there all evening or not And its up to us to make the choice the Very Young Man ex IN THE MURDERERS BRAIN claimed
But how in the devil Ive sent for them the Psycholo gist said
Theyll be here any min ute
Now gentlemefi there is little for you to domost of it negative
You may hear for instance queer grinding clicking noise
Ignore it
Pretend it does not exist
want the murderer perhaps to think he is imagining it The Psychologists lean sensitive face was grim now as he added The guilt is in the brain of one of these two men
Im going to drag it outwithout him knowing it club attendant appeared at the door of the room
George Bolton is here to see Dr Allaire Send him in The Psychologist stood up
The idea is gentlemen he added hurriedly Ive told both these suspects that wealthy ec centric criminologist is interested in the casethat he is convinced they are both innocenthas hired me scientifically to demonstrate it
Whether they believe that or not is immaterial
Neither dared refuse to come
So you gentlemen act with the assumption of sympathy
An experiment in applied psychology to prove innocence not guilt
And we will EORGE BOLTON entered the room and stood staring surprised confused by the number of men all of whom were gazing at him in tently
He was tall blond broad shouldered very handsome young fellow dressed in neat dark busi ness suit
DrAllaire he said hesitantly
am Dr Allaire the Psycholo gist said
He indicated chair
Sit down please
Thank you for coming Mr Bolton The young man smiled
OK how do you do
thought Id got ten into the wrong room These gentlemen are my fellow club members the Psychologist ex plained
need not introduce them by name
Gentlemen this is Mr Bolton
The police seem to think he might be guilty of the crime Ive been describing to you Young Bolton smiled nervously at the men as he sat down
The po lice have been pretty tough on me all day
What is it you want of me Dr Allaire
Lord knows Fve al ready told Again the attendant appeared
Thomas Dale is here Dr Al laire Send him in Arthur At the name young Bolton had leaped to his feet
Why you didnt tell mewhat is this some more inquisition No the Psychologist smiled
Quite the reverse
Sit down Mr Bolton
The police told me that was one of your troublesyoure too im petuous
If can prove your inno cence youll be free of the police
Dont you understand
As things are they cant prove thing but theyll hound you trying and hop ing But the young man wasnt listen ing
With flushed face he stared at the door where now Thomas Dale stood calmly surveying the room
Allaire am Dr Allaire
Come in Mr Dale The Psychologist introduced the club members
The second suspect was an extreme contrast to young Boltona man of thirty short but powerfully built
His dark hair was thinning at the temples
His smooth shaven face of rugged features was somewhat pale
He had been an actor and it showed now in the selfpossession with which he ac knowledged the introductions
And then his quiet gaze landed upon Bolton who was standing with clenched fists
How do you do Bolton he said
didnt know you had been invited here
Where do you want me to sit Dr Allaire Certainly there was no love lost between the two men
The Psycholo gist placed them in small chairs side by side
They were diagonally facing the intent group of club members with the Psychologist standing before them
owe you both an explanation he began quietly
have been com missioned to try and produce some POPULAR DETECTIVE evidence that will persuade the po lice to let you alone
My client is aware that there is no evidence against either of you Who is your client Bolton asked
Is he here
No one is in terested in me am not at liberty to name him the Psychologist said
Perhaps it is myself
Why not
am inter estedwell to be frank if not in you two certainly in applied psy chology He smiled at the two men who now were staring at him with an almost breathless intentness
And it was obvious that both of them considered his words as preface to some new questioning with the same purpose the police had had all day
One was guilty
One innocent
No choice could be made from their outward aspect
Wholly different types they had balked the police young Bolton with an impetuous angry flush or grim sullenness and Thomas Dale with seemingly quiet desire to give all the information he could and an imperturbable selfpos session
It is not my purpose to question you the Psychologist went on
manas the police have told you was seen killing Peter Mackenzie
Unfortunately the witness cannot describe that man
It could have been either of youor anyone of thousand other men Which is very hard on us Dale said
It is indeed
quite agree with you
To come to the pointI have invited these gentlemen here as wit nesses to an experiment in psy chology Wait minute Mr Bol ton dont interrupt me please
You are both innocentyou have told the police so
And both of you know by now very well indeed that there is not particle of evidence against either one of you He paused and then he abruptly added You dont know do you any thing of what happened between Mackenzie and his murderer on that bridge do not Bolton said
How could Dale said
My idea is to tell you what hap pened the Psychologist continued
He smiled faintly
Not that know what happened because dont
But what tell you want you to remember
Will you try dont understand Dale be gan
Then both he and Bolton nodded dubiously
The watching men could not miss the fact that both were frightened
But still there could be no choice guilty man afraid of exposurebut an in nocent man would also be afraid that by some mischance he would be incriminated
Yes they both said
And Dale added Ill try my best to do what ever you suggest Thanks An abrupt tenseness seemed to come to the room as the Psycholo gist took folded sheet of paper from his pocket and adjusted his glasses
have here some notes made on what probably happened up there on the bridge
am going to read them to youI want you to listen carefully
The theory isinto your empty mind am going to put these facts
They are quite simple
want you to engrave them there in your brain stared at the flushed young Bolton and the pale Thomas Dale
Perhaps one of them now had wild desire to withdraw but if so he did not dare show it
Are you ready the Psycholo gist added quietly
Again they both nodded
Very slowly with careful but drab in tonation which emphasized no word the Psychologist read The murderer led his victim onto the bridge
They talked in the moonlight about Alice
They were angry
The murderer said never made love to her Then they sat on the bench by the rail and the vic tim said
But it is not like my child
You cannot make me believe it The victim was toying with blue cap in his hand
Then mo IN THE MURDERERS BRAIN ment later the murderer pushed him over the rail
He fell to the railroad track and lay crumpled between the gleaming rails with the moonlight bathing him The room was heavily silent as the Psychologist paused
And look ing up from his notes he added Thats clear isnt it
want you to memorize it not necessarily word for word but the exact sense of it
Ill read it again Even more slowly more drably than before he repeated it
And then at once added You Jack Bruce From across the room the Very Young Man looked startled
Yes sir Just beyond that door the Psychologist gestured put small table with some articles on it Bring it in will you please
Care fully Jack The Very Young Man hastened to obey and came back at once from the adjoining room dragging small square table with group of mis cellaneous articles spread upon it
Here you are Dr Allaire Thanks Jack The Psychologist drew the table before young Bolton and Thomas Dale who stared at it silently
With out speaking the Psychologist touched switch
The roomlights faded
Shadows enveloped all the intent men and from the ceiling narrow white beam of light came down to illumine the table with the objects lying there fully revealed in the white glare
The Psychologist was in the shadow
Close at the edge of the circle of white illumination young Bolton and Dale sat staring fas cinated
There were perhaps twenty objects arranged on the table
They were all commonplace seemingly without any relation to each other Dr Allaires personal card an en velope and letterhead of the Scien tific Crime Club mans brown felt hat and gloves silverheaded cane an old battered doll blue knitted little cape few coins From the shadows the Psycholo gist said quietly My idea is to put into your mind knowledge of these things almost all of which are wholly unrelated to the crime That was Alices doll young Bolton said abruptly
Yes Dale agreed
Ive seen it
She said she had it most of her life she treasured it have no purpose of trying to find out which of them you recog nize the Psychologist said
That isquite He let his voice trail away and in the silence of the shadowed room now very faint sound was audible
low grinding clinking sound
It was muffledindescribably queer
It lasted no more than five seconds
In the darkness someone shifted his feet as though startled
Dale and Bolton both murmured some thing but the Psychologists voice had only stopped for those five sec onds and now he was talking again The things on that table have no relation to each other He moved forward into the white glare and shoved the table away
Forget them
want you only to remember what happened on the bridge be tween the victim and the murderer
read it to you twice ROM his pocket he took two pen cils and two small pads of writ ing paper and handed them to young Bolton and Dale
You can scribble in the dark ness he said
And neither can see what the other is writing
Put your name at the topand then write your memory of what read you Well Dale murmured
may get it wrong Bolton said
Do your best Neither of them wrote hastily
It was several minutes before they had finished
Here you are Bolton said
Dale handed his silently
The Psychologist took the two scrawled papers
In the silence of the shadowed room several of the men tensely shifted themselves in their chairs
Thomas Dale and young Bolton were dim blobs POPULAR DETECTIVE the gloom
At the circle of white glare beating down on the floor now where the table had been the Psy chologist stood in shadow
OR moment he silently read what the two men had written
This is very interesting gentle men There was just hint of emotion vibrating in his voice
comparison of these two little es says with my original will interest you all very much indeed
To re fresh your memories
Ill read you again my exact original words which Mr Bolton and Mr Dale at tempted to reproduce cant be sure Dale mur mured out of the darkness
Dont interrupt me now please the Psychologist retorted sharply
He was holding his original paper into the light
Here was what asked them to reproduce The murderer led his victim onto the bridge
They talked in the moon light about Alice
They were angry
The murderer said never made love to her They then sat on the bench by the rail and the victim said But it is not like my child
You cannot make me believe it The victim was toying with blue cap in his hand
Then moment later the murderer pushed him over the rail
He fell to the railroad track and lay crumpled between the gleaming rails with the moonlight bathing him There is the original
Now here is what one of them wrote
Analyze it carefully gentlemen
The murderer took his victim to the bridge
They stood in the star light and they talked angrily about Alice
The murderer said did not ever make love to her They were sitting by the rail and Mackenzie said
My child is not like that
dont believe it He was toying with something blue in his hand
Then suddenly the murderer shoved him over the rail
He fell and lay crum pled on the gleaming railroad track bathed by the starlight From the darkness of the intent room as the Psychologist paused came the Lawyers voice
He seems to have made several errors Dr Allaire but dont ex actly see what Let me analyze them for you
Please be quiet you twono apol ogies are necessary for your errors
This writer says starlight instead of moonlight
He says they were sitting by the rail
mentioned that they sat on the bench by the rail
He says Mackenzie was toying with something blue in his hand
said it was blue cap but he evidently forgot that The Psychologist was talking swiftly now
So much for that one gentlemen
Now Ill read you the other
The murderer and his victim went out onto the bridge
It was moonlight and they talked about the girl and the murderer said But did not ever make love to her They were sitting on the box by the rail
Mackenzie was toying with blue cape in his hand and the murderer said It is not my child you cannot mako
me believe it Then the murderer pushed him through the rail andhe fell to the track with the gleaming headlight bathing him startled gasp had come from several of the men in the darkness
Gentlemen the Psychologist added which is the guilty version That one Several of them chorused it
No question of it the Psy chologist said crisply
Lights Mar berry please glare of lights sprang in the room
Thomas Dale was sitting pale intent awestruck
Young George Bolton was on his feet flushed trembling with hand flung before his eyes in the glare
Its lie he cried
didnt do it
didnt mean to write those things
dont know what possessed me The guilt in your brain possessed you the Psychologist said ironi cally
Theres your man Mar berry From the doorway the bulky uni formed police sergeant sprang for IN THE MURDERERS BRAIN ward gripping the terrified Bolton
So they got youan couldnt
Come onout with ityou cant lie out of this canI mean there isnt any thing to lie out of
You take your hands off me found out more about him this afternoon the Sergeant said
Hes been making love to an heiress over in Pleasant Hills
located her dragged it out of her Thats lie Bolton stood struggling in the Sergeants grip
Oh is it Marberry said
Well youll get chance to tell her that before the Then Bolton suddenly broke
All right did it
You let me alone tell you
Stop torturing meall of youlet me alone
Glorias right am engaged to herher father knows it And poor little Alice Mackenzie with her coming child and her dogged outraged fatherthey were the obstacles the Psychologist said
murder motive as old as history
And despicable beyond most murder motives
Take him away Marberry ND when the room had quieted the Psychologist said That was very simple psy chological test gentlemenand one that is almost infallible
true and false memory cannot be distin guished by the mind
Bolton un doubtedly knew he had dangerous problem
Whatever guilty facts had mentioned he also must men tion
To have ignored guilty facts would have been confession that he recognized them as guilty
Dale had no guilty memories at all to confuse him
He had no prob lem except to try and remember what had read
He said starlight got it mixed with moonlight
It generally is mixed on clear night
He forgot the blue capjust re membered something blue
He forgot the bench on which they were sit ting
That was reasonable
bench is unusual on bridge
As mat ter of fact there is no bench on that bridge
wanted to make sure of re freshing the guilty memories in this murderers mind and confusing those guilty memories with the memory of what had read
You recall that faint mysterious clank ing sound while ago which we all ignored
It meant nothing to the innocent Thomas Dale
It was my simulationin an ad joining room hereof the sound of the gears shifting the railroad sema phore signals which are on the bridge
We knew the murderer must have heard those gears shift as the train approached
They make quite racket and he and Mackenzie were sitting on the gear box
And the articles on that table the Psychologist continued most of them were meaningless
To the in nocent Dale that little blue cape lying beside Alices doll probably looked like doll cape
But to the murderer it was little garment for the coming baby
Mackenzie had it in his handthey found it still clutched in his dead fingers
Evi dently he had brought it to appeal to this seducer
Bolton recognized it on the table
And when said blue capMacken zie owned no blue capit was al most inevitable that Bolton should confuse the memories and think that said blue cape
And he was the only one who knew of the coming child
The autopsy showed it but the fact was never mentioned
He garbled my sentences on that pointgot my words almost all cor rectbut out came his guilty knowl edge of the child when had said something wholly different
And Mackenzie was pushed through the rail not over it
And in the deep railroad cut the moonlight did not penetrate
Boltonstaring down at his victimhad an inescapable memory of the body bathed not by moonlight but by the headlight of the advancing train
Guilty memories gentlemen are the murderers greatest danger
Its almost impossible for him to hide themif you dig for them in scien tific fashion Ken Boyce Burns the Road for Easy The revolvers blasted lead Novelette MURDER CHAPTER Crash WAS like seeing traffic cop in the middle of South African veldt
Ken Boyce felt like that
He told himself anyone would feel like that seeing him strolling along this se rene country highway
He didnt be long on this highway any more than the cop belonged on the veldt
He didnt fit in with the fencedin pas tures the blotches of green woods and cultivated fields that rolled in gentle swells for miles on either side of the road
He didnt fit in with the specks of white that were the distant farmhouses and only signs of civilization in the countryside
There was nothing rural about Ken Boyce

The guy who drove that kind would have dough and if hed made his dough anywhere around this hick district hed just be sucker enough and soft enough to pick up stranger
Especially when the stranger didnt look like bum
Still swearing softly he stamped his feet on the macadam of the highway to get the dust off his shoes
Ken Boyce prided himself on his ability to dress
It was his weakness
He liked expensive clothes and he liked expensive shoes
These shoes for instance these custom made fullbrogued shoes had cost Shotand Gets Swell CloseUp
POPULAR DETECTIVE him fortyfive bucks
There was only one shop in New York that sold them an ultra smart shop that he cheerfully frequented whenever he had any money and could buy good shoes
He cursed the quiet serenity of the countryside
It got on his nerves
He cursed the fact that hed spent two of his last twelve bucks for bus fare to this hellforsaken farm dis trict
He ought to have known bet ter than to attempt job like this on his own
When hed climbed out of the bus three or four miles back at some jerkwater little burg he should have turned around and gone back to New York instead of hiking down this placid deserted highway
Hell he wasnt even sure that this was the right spot
It was just wild surmise hed had picking this spot
The racket had worked once before here and he saw no reason why it wouldnt work again
heard the sound of another car behind him
If it werent for the fact that he had ten bucks be tween him and vacuum stomach and the fact that he was in bad with Kelly because big shot Ace Daggert had put another one over on him and monopolized every rackethell if it werent for Daggert Ken Boyce knew hed never even have attempted this longshot job
Boyce had to admire Daggert be cause the bigtime racketeer was dresser like himself
He liked ex pensive clothes too had earned his nickname Ace because of his ex travagant taste
But Daggert was racketeer and killer and he had put one over on Boyce for the last time
That was the reason Kelly had fired him
And Boyce had fig ured if hed go off on his own and pull job like this successfully maybe Kelly would reinstate him
Because this was job that none of Kellys boys had been able to pull off
The car rushed abreast of him
Boyce turned languidly then his heart skipped few strokes
This was the kind of car hed been wait ing fori He jerked up his thumb
Hey he yelled
Going my way The big expensivelooking sedan flashed by him
Then he heard the sound of brakes and tires skidding on the macadam
The sedan pulled to stop twenty yards in front of him and he could see the driver turn around and beckon to him through the window in the rear
Boyce ran to the car took time hastily to brush his immaculate suit before he opened the door to the front seat Many thanks he smiled
thought Id never get lift The man at the steering wheel grinned goodnaturedly
Get in he said
Im going as far as Elmsdale
been home eating lunch and reckon Mary took too long to feed me
got to get back to the bank
Im president of the bank
Finest bank in Elmsdale
Only bank in Elmsdale
Were mighty proud of it
Get in friend
Get in Boyce smiled at the typical lo quacity of the obvious small town citizen
And yetand his smile was trifle grima banker would be an ideal setup for the job
He couldnt have struck it better or luckier
He got in beside the rotund jovialfaced little man and the banker started the car again
My names Herbert Knox the little man said
What you doing hiking this highway friend
You look like city feller
You look like those pictures in the fashion maga zines
You look like you could af ford an airplane stead of hoofing it Boyce ignored the mans affable curiosity
He kept his eyes on the road as though searching intently for something
You pick up strangers like this very often he said
Knox laughed
give everybody lift friend
Thats why people keep their money in my bank
trust everybody and they trust me But Im stranger
might pull gun on you and frisk you for everything youve got Knox winked out of the comer of his eye
MURDER INSURANCE Not you he laughed
You dont need money
Not with those classy duds
Now if you looked like bum Id never stopped and picked you up Boyce nodded eyes still searching the road
It was no wonder he thought the racket had worked in this part of the country before
People around here were real people honest farmers
They were guile less
And this racket was ingenious it had worked on far more sophis ticated people than farmers
It was cinch
And if Ken Boyce could get into it then Kelly would give him another chanceand another chance to get in with Ace Daggert
Boyce suddenly started sat up right in the seat
Knox whistled said softly Ill be darned On the right side of the road facing their oncoming car her thumb asking for lift was fem inine hitchhiker
But like Ken Boyce she wasnt an ordinary hitch hiker
She was slim and from that distance beautiful
Her modish sport suit had come from fash ionably expensive designer in some large city
She looked like raven haired heiress out for stroll
got to stop for that girl Knox said smiling and jamming on the brakes
Shes lulu
She looks like your class Mister
Some pump kin
Wonder why she wants ride He backed the car until it came to stop beside the girl
Going my way maam he asked smiling
Glad to give you lift far as Elmsdale Boyce saw that her clothes were not imitation
They were the real thing
He appreciated that
He ap preciated the brown eyes with an iridescent touch of violet in them the small pert nose and the firm red lips which smiled little hesitantly as she climbed into the back seat
One thing struck him singularly something about her eyes the way she held her lips indicated that she was nervous and tense
More than that she was distraught and afraid though she tried to conceal it
As the car started Boyce threw his left arm around the back of the seat half turned and said Youre long way from home arent you She smiled quickly at him
Yes ama little New York She hesitated moment then said Yes Now you take New York Knox began
only been to it once but OYCES even tones interrupted him as he addressed the girl
Did you run out of gas or some thing IIm going home she said
was in show in New York and it closed
couldnt get anything else to do so started home
came as far as could on the bus before Ibefore ran out of money
There was nothing else to do and thought perhaps could catch rides Say now Knox began again sympathetically
Thats mighty tough But again Boyce cut him short
Where is your home Inin Maryland Thats going to be long walk if you dont catch good many long rides Yes
Yes but its the only thing can do Boyce watched her
She was bit ing her delicate underlip
He knew she was lying
She had answered him as though she were reciting lines that someone had forced her to memorize
But he liked her
She was beautiful but she had lot more than just beautyand she was deathly afraid
He knew busses ran only twice day through this part of New Jer sey
And she hadnt been on his bus
If shed come on the one early that morning it had taken her an awfully long time to walk this far
But he liked her
He liked the way her eyes seemed to reach out to him and appeal in mutely ashamed way for help
For some reason he knew hed help her just as he knew she was trying her ut POPULAR DETECTIVE most to be honest with him and was afraid to be
Knox started to say something over his shoulder as he gave the car more gas
And then he uttered an alarmed cry and the car jolted and swerved violently as he applied the brakes with all his strength
Ken Boyce swung around and his eyes widened
Instinctively he stiff ened his legs against the floorboard as futile shock absorber
He heard the girl gasp with frightened in take of breath that ended in little sob
Knox had been doing close to fifty
They were going through section of the road that was bor dered by green woods on each side
Directly ahead was little crossroad that was concealed on both sides of the highway by the trees
conscientious but inconsid erate State Highway commissioner had placed Stop sign on the highway so that like in so many countryside counties the insignifi cant little crossroad traffic had the right of way
HOOTING out from this inter section was disreputable touring car the driver taking his time as though unaware of the headon col lision
Knox had his brakes down to the floor but the car shrieked as its impetus carried it skidding forward they were going to smash and it seemed nothing could prevent it
Boyce heard Knoxs frightened squeal he heard the whimper of the girl behind him
He couldnt close his eyes
Dread of the inevitable crash looming in front kept them wide open staring
It enabled him to see the sudden expert maneuver by the other driver at the last split second
The man sent his car leap ing ahead so that his left rear fen der was torn away by Knoxs left front fender
That apparently was the only damage done
Knox managed to bring his car to stop fifteen yards down the road
For moment he was too frightened to move
Boyce glanced back quickly to see if the girl was all right
Her face was white but otherwise she appeared to be un hurt
Better back up he said quietly to Knox
The other fellow is get ting out of his car There was strange expression on Ken Boyces lean face an odd triumph was there and disappoint ment too
The disappointment reg istered plainly when he shot the girl another quick glance
Knox backed the car and he and Boyce got out
The man coming to ward them was brute of fellow with barrel chest and long thick arms and legs
There was an ugly expression on his face as he tow ered over Knox
Look what you done squirt he said succinctly
Tore the fender off my buggy
An you mighta killed me if hadnt done some quick thinkin Your thinking was little too quick wasnt it Boyce asked quietly
Sort of as if you knew exactly what you were doing The man whirled on Boyce
You keep outa this
This little squirt damn near killed me
He busted up my car
guess he must be blind or else he didnt pay no attention to that Stop sign Knox was frightened but he made commendable effort to draw him self up
Listen Mister
been drivin this here road for forty Never mind what you been do ing
You wrecked my car an any courtll award me any damages ask
Got that
But Ill be soft on you an take hundred bucks an call it square
Understand Knox suddenly put his hand in his pocket and drew out some bills
Ill give you fifty friend
And thats too darned much hundred squirt
Or Ill collect plenty in court and youll collect sentence Knoxs florid face went redder
got reputation to think of he said slowly
Im bank presi dent
dont want any scandal
Heres your hundred
Now go away and MURDER INSURANCE Okay squirt the man said tak ing the money
Never mind the orders
Youre lucky to get off this easy CHAPTER II Hitchhikers Racket EN BOYCE had walked over to Knoxs car
He watched while the girl got shakily out of the car
She re fused his proffered arm of assistance
She leaned against the car rubbing her forehead with her hand
My head she murmured
Its my head You were okay minute ago Boyce said callously
She glanced at him sharply for moment there was panic in her eyes
Then she began rubbing her head again
Somethings happened to my head she said
must have hit it against the front seat when we stopped so suddenly
It hurts Her voice trailed off in bewildered dazed way
Whats your name Boyce said abruptly
He knew she answered spontane ously before she had any time to think
Adelaide Page Then she real ized she had been trapped and she tried quickly to cover up
No thats not my real name
use that sometimes on the stage
My names Joan Brown Why asked Boyce sardonically do people always say Brown or Smith when theyre lying about their names
guess its the first thing comes into their heads Thatthats my name She had been fumbling with her hand bag
She took out pencil and paper called to Knox to come over
The little banker left his argument with the big man came over
Whats your name Adelaide Page said
Im Herbert Knox
Sorry if Ive caused you Let me see your license Mr Knox Eyeing her with puzzled expres sion the little man took out his wallet
She copied the details of his license on her paper
Youll hear from methrough my lawyer Mr Knox she said
Knox gaped at her
Whywhy dont see he stuttered
The girl Boyce saw was making desperate attempt to keep the fright out of her voice keep it slow and steady but it faltered little
Knox there is lawshe sounded as though she were reciting again and hated to do itthere is law that makes the owner and driver of car responsible for any person he is carrying with him
No matter who it is
If that passen ger is in any way injured the driver is responsible and liable to dam age suit
have hurt my head
How badly dont know
But am going to sue you for exactly one hundred thousand dollars Butbut spluttered Knox it wasnt my fault
This man This manshe nodded to the driver of the other carwill be witness to the fact that was in jured while you were taking his right of way and smashing his car Ken Boyce looked at her
The en tire setup was one of the neatest rackets he had ever heard of
This was what he had been expecting
She had Knox dead to rights and the big man would be her witness
It was racket that even Ace Dag gert would be proud to work
And now Boyce had it by the horns
He was glad of that
Kelly would be glad and would give him back his job for breaking into this racket
He had Knox for witness
The only thing was the girl
Somehow he detected note of revulsion for her job in her attitude
She was going through with it be cause she had to
Something was going to happen to her if she didnt
He reached in his pocket produced his wallet
Okay Adelaide
Its all over POPULAR DETECTIVE with now
You made nice attempt but it didnt work
Ill take that paper you have
It can be used as evidence He showed her his open wallet
She looked at the card inside then up at him
Terror had come into her eyes
For moment he thought she was going to cry
You she whispered you are Thats right
Special investiga tor for the Consolidated Insurance Company
Weve been trying to break this racket of yours for long time
But you and your bunch have been too clever
Kelly my chief had just about given it up and Con solidated has been forced to pay out to you for its clients because of lack of evidence
But thought youd try it again and this time hit the right spot HE had recoiled as his words lashed out in low incisive tone
Even as he spoke he could not be lieve that she was part of the scheme of which he was accusing her
Not with her face not with her eyes which were frightened and bewildered and seemed to look to him for help
But he made himself go on his voice still caustic
Yeah Miss Adelaide Page you and your bunch have sweet racket or you had because Im going to bust it wide open and this time have Mr Herbert Knox to testify as my witness He noticed that the girls eyes were darting across the road to where wagon path disappeared into thick clump of woods
He glanced at the path saw nothing but his hand went under his coat and de liberately he brought out his automatic
He saw that now the big man had moved close to them and the girl was looking at his scowling face with mixture of panic and appeal in her glance
He held the Colt in an apparently careless position at his side as he went on talking Mr
Knox is just one of many of your victims
You Adelaide as pretty girl are used as bait
You walk along road wait until an expensive car comes along and catch ride
Immediately you are in the car the driver becomes responsible and liable for your personal secu rity
Thats law the average man doesnt know exists
You as his pas senger can collect any amount of damages you want providing you get shyster lawyer to prove you were hurt
So one of your mob is planted down the road and at the opportune time he slightly smashes into the car youre in taking care he has the right of way
Then you pull your stunt and you have your victim practically helpless
And Consolidated has been paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars to their clients Who have been The girls eyes had widened and were staring across at the wagon path
She gave little gasp of fright started to move
For an in stant Boyces eyes flicked to the path
He saw three men rushing out of the woods ugly shortsnouted revolvers in their hands
Then his head rocked snapped back and he felt himself sprawling on his back his automatic skidding from his hand
The big man had waited for his chance and his huge fist had caught Ken Boyces jaw during the split second interval the insurance
in vestigator had glanced at the path
The man had grabbed Adelaides hand was rushing her across the road to his rickety touring car
gun had appeared in his hand and as Ken scrambled for his own Colt the big man threw shot at him from over his shoulder
The lead splattered into the macadam at Boyces knees
He found his gun raised it was aiming at the man when sudden fusillade of shots snapped and barked around him
The three men wefe firing as they ran for the touring car
Get behind your car Boyce called to Knox
The little banker stood in the open dazed his mouth sagging with fright
He did not seem to hear the Special Investigators brittle com mand
He looked uncertainly from MURDER INSURANCE the big man who was dragging the girl into the disreputable car to the three who were charging across the road guns flaming as they ran
Boyces automatic bucked his palm twice and one of the men pitched forward on his face
The other two succeeded in making it to the car which they stood behind and used as barricade while their re volvers blasted lead across the open road
Knox had miraculously escaped being hit so far but he stood in frozen fright unable to move while shots splattered his own car three feet behind him
Ken Boyce crouch ing behind the radiator saw that the little man was not going to run to cover
He edged along the fender suddenly leaped for Knox
Even as he reached him the banker cried out and slipped side ward to the road his mouth flecked with red two blackedged holes in his throat
He was dead by the time his loose body sprawled out on the macadam
CRY of rage escaped Ken Boyces lips as the little man fell at his feet
Knox had been an inno cent bystander as well as Boyces sole witness
Now he was dead vic tim of the racket
bullet tore away the cloth un der Boyces armpit as he leaped back to the safety of Knoxs car
He heard the whir of the touring cars starter the roar of the engine as the big man jammed it into gear
The car spurted forward then stopped abruptly as Boyce sent bullet into the big mans head
He slumped over the wheel and Boyce had fleeting glimpse of the girl pushing him to one side
The cars unexpected movement had left the two gunmen in the open road unprotected by its ton neau
Boyces automatic jetted flame and one of them spun forward on his chest his head lolling to one side
The investigators gun came up once more drew bead on the remaining man
But Ken Boyce didnt fire
The man was hesitating his face turned toward the girl in the touring car listening
Boyce saw that he was young with mop of blond hair and weak but handsome face
The girl was talking to him rapidly her face white body tensed as she crouched behind the steering wheel
Suddenly the young fellow nodded to her threw down his revolver and started across the road toward the insurance investigator his hands in the air
Ken Boyce stood up his automatic raised
Almost as though an un canny sixth sense had aided his vision he suddenly was aware of three things happening simultane ously
The girl bent low over the wheel her foot frantically searching for the selfstarter the blond young man advancing unarmed across the road and back where the wagon path entered the woods man ap pearing
Thinking it ruse to detract his attention Boyce drew bead on the blond fellows chest
Hold it he shouted
Stop there and keep your hands up The youth kept on coming terror written across his pallid face
Then suddenly there was blood on his mouth dripping over his lower lip and chin and he sank to his knees
Boyce heard the hysterical scream of the girl as she straightened up from the wheel and saw the blond man drop
Then he swiveled his gun to meet the figure standing at the mouth of the wagon path
He never saw the figure clearly
It became blur that he could not distinguish from the trunks of the trees behind it
He was sinking crazily to his knees hot pain at the side of his head where bullet had ripped
His gun slipped to the macadam and he groped blindly for it laughing halfhysterically with pain as he noticed the suit he took such pride in was torn and dusty the expensive shoes that could be bought at only one store were scarred and creased where lead had flicked them
He had his gun inhis hand was trying to straighten up clear his head in order to find the figure of POPULAR DETECTIVE the man who had shot him
He got to his knees tried to push himself up with one hand then saw mans feet planted squarely in front of him
Too late he tried to jerk his head away from what he knew was com ing
He felt the splitting thump of revolver butt against the back of his head and after that there was no feeling at all
CHAPTER III Accused ROWNING Kelly chief of the Consoli dated Insurance Special Investigators shook his black head vigorously his bleak blue eyes snapping
You had chance to turn trick that would have put you in solid with your job Boyce he rapped
And you would have put all of us in solid with Consolidated
None of us has been able to break that racket and here you have the chance and you let it slip through your fingers
No wonder wont give you your job back Ken Boyce stood before his chief and rubbed his forehead with his hand
It was bandaged his face was bleak and tiredlooking his suit was torn and disheveled
Look Chief he muttered it took two bucks to ride back here on the bus
Ive only got eight left and thats every cent Ive got in the world
You cant expect me to fol low this case up with only eight bucks
Give me my job back and an advance on my sal Advance Kelly roared
Listen you havent got job so you cant have an advance
How you going to follow up this case anyway
What have you got to go on
Noth ing
Nothing but the fact that guy named Knox was found shot to death beside his car
Sure there were bullet Scars on his car and it looked like gun battle but what can you prove
They found him dead and they found you alive
Hell Id been just as satisfied if it had been the other way around What chance did have against five mugsall with gats spitting at me
think did pretty well con sidering Five guys
There wasnt anybody there except you and Knox Naturally
Whoever it was clipped me on the head dumped the other stiffs into the car took the girl and drove away
All Ive got to do is find the guy that clipped me and Ill have the racket tied up in knots
Because hes the big shot the guy behind the whole works Kellys bleak eyes went colder
His voice was thin with sarcasm
Yeah all youve got to do is find the guy who clipped you
There are only seven million souls in this city so it wont be too difficult for the great detective Boyce to pick the right guy out of seven million Ken Boyce bent over the desk
His tired eyes had strange light in them
Chief know where to find that guy
can find him Yeah you can find him Besides theres that girl
Some how dont believe she fits in with that bunch of hoodlums
She sort of asked me for help in silent way Oh she sort of asked you for help in silent way Yes
And believe can help her
can get to the bottom of the racket and that will help her Kelly stood up his blue eyes frosty
Get out of here Boyce
Youre crazy
Youve failed on this assign ment just as you failed on the as signments gave you to nab Ace Daggert
Youre through
Get out Ken looked at his former chief for long moment his cobalt eyes defiant
Then he walked to the door of the office turned
Okay Chief he said
If thats how you want it thats how you want it
Butthere was an odd confident smile on his firm lips youre going to be in for sur prise
good one
You put up MURDER INSURANCE big kick about Daggert and you kicked about this insurance racket and not you nor any of your men could get to either
Ive got hunch youll give me my job back and bonus to spare when come in with both Daggert and this racket Get out of here Boyce before you get me as goofy as you are Okay Chief
Okay Boyce didnt waste any time
He caught Fifth Avenue bus and stayed on it until he reached Forty second Street
Then he got off and walked midway down the block on Fifth until he came to fashionable shop with sign over the small doorway Essex Boots for Gentlemen He went in
One of the clerks in cutaway hurried up to him smiled
How you do Mr Boyce he murmured
Something can do for you OYCE nodded his eyes encom passing the smart glass cases dec orated with ultraexpensive shoes of all models
Yeah tell Mr Wilke Id like to see him The clerk looked surprised and trifle hurt
The manager Mr Boyce
Is something unsatisfactory
Im cer tain will do my best Just tell Mr Wilke want to see him The clerk hurried away
In few minutes Mr Wilke small and dap per appeared
Something wrong Mr Boyce
Or is it that you wish specially constructed model
hope you were pleased with those Scotchgrained sports that you bought
Ah see you have them on and they look as though they had been through the wars
Is it Listen Mr Wilke
This is the only shop in town sells the kind of shoe have on isnt it Mr Wilke looked pained
The only shop in the country Mr Boyce
We are proud of the dis tinction Well look
Can you gire me list of the men who have bought this kind of shoes in the last month
Its important Mr Wilke studied his nails for moment
Then You are some sort of detective Mr Boyce
will go so far as to disregard the rules of the store for that reason
If you will come with me Ken Boyce grinned
He thought of Ace Daggert and his reputation as dresser
He thought of the feet he had glimpsed just before that gunbutt had descended on his head he remembered the shoes
Those brogues were the same he remem bered as his own
And he figured there was only one place in town where they could be bought
He smiled again and fol lowed Mr Wilke into the adjoining office He had something less than eight dollars left when he came out of the subway at Seventhninth and walked over to West End Avenue
He stopped in front of an imposing greystone facaded apartment house
Down the street he could see strip of Riverside Drive as it wended its way along the bank of the Hudson
This was section of wealth
Only the rich could afford apartments in these buildings
Boyce adjusted the gun in his shoulder holster taking care that the uniformed doorman did not see his action
Then he went through the glass doors across the luxurious intimate lobby to the desk
The clerk was busy at the moment with register book and Boyce turned his back leaned against the desk and waited patiently
He straightened up stared for split second with mingled surprise and pleasure as she came in then turned his face away quickly so she wouldnt see
It was Adelaide Page and the girl went straight for the elevators
Boyce sauntered after her
Sorry to keep you waiting sir the clerk called after him
May help you No thanks Boyce said out of POPULAR DETECTIVE the side of his mouth
can find my way now The girl was staring fixedly at her feet face taut eyes little glazed with pain and what Boyce thought might be sorrow
Something in his throat tightened as he watched her
He didnt want to see her hurt this way she didnt deserve it
She was too good to look at something about her was too instinctively fine
She didnt belong in any kind of rotten racket
He felt sudden im pulse to tell her so to tell her he was trying to help her to take her in his arms and tell her not to worry
He looked away
The elevator door opened and she stepped in
Boyce decided to get in with her and risk the chance of her recognizing him before she had led him to the apartment
Unless he gave the nature of his business to the clerk at the desk he would never be given the apartment number
And Adelaide appeared so despon dent and preoccupied that he did not think she would even glance at him
She didnt
On the sixth floor she got out
He waited until she had walked part of the way down the redcarpeted cor ridor then followed her at re spectful distance
TILL oblivious of anything but the thoughts preying so despairingly on her mind the girl stopped in front of one of the mahogany doors extended her hand to the brass knocker
For moment she hesi tated as though trying to make up her mind or steel herself for an unpleasant ordeal
look of grim determination flashed over her pale face and she reached resolutely for the knocker
Wait Ken Boyce said softly
Wait Adelaide
Dont go in there
Let me talk to you first She spun around frightened
As she recognized him her expression changed and hatred suddenly took the place of fear
The violet in her eyes seemed to grow black the nos trils of the delicate nose flared
Her voice was virulent and husky with restrained rage
What do you want
What are you doing here killer Her abrupt vehemence caught Boyce unawares
dont he murmured
What are you Havent you done enough the girl whispered hoarsely
thought at first could trust you
Somehow thought you stood for what is honorable and clean But dont see You turned out to be more of rat coward than any of those animals was with
Youre cow ard and killer EN BOYCE shook his head
dont understand what you mean
But do know that want to help you
wanted to yes terday
want to now
Thats one of the reasons Im here
You must believe that
can help you if youll let meif youll trust me She looked at him intently her eyes softening trifle
Then they glinted again and her voice was hard
She said How can trust coward
man who would mercilessly shoot down an unarmed manhardly more than boy Adelaide
What do you mean
didnt shoot down She moved closer to him her eyes flashing her breath coming sharply between her words
Yes you did
The blond young man who talked to methe one convinced to go to you and surren der because he was young and weak and because he wasnt bad but frightened
He did what told him
He threw away his gun started across the road to you and you you shot my brother without giving him chance All the emotion of her hatred seemed to ebb as the scene was re called to her mind and suddenly she was crying sobbing softly as she swayed back against the wall of the corridor her hands covering her face her bosom rising and falling as the sobs caught in her throat
Pain and bewilderment etched MURDER INSURANCE Ken Boyces face
He moved close to her
didnt know he was your brother Adelaide
And didnt shoot him
You know that
You must know it
It was someone elses bul let not mine Slowly she looked up at him her eyes wet Hie catch still in her throat
But if you didnt shoot Ted who who did Boyce took both her hands in his and pressed them
Im going to find out he said softly
believe the man who shot your brother was the man who came out of that wagon path when it was almost all over the same man who clipped me on the head the same man whom Ive been trying to nab for long time the man who owns this apartment insideAce Dag gert HE girl caught her breath sharply
Butbut he wouldnt shoot Ted
Ted was working for him
Ted was one of Aces men
Ace wouldnt shoot one of his own men Ace saw that you had convinced your brother to surrender to me
Ace didnt want that
That would be living evidence against him
Be fore hed let that happen he Boyce broke off significantly
Then he looked intently at the girl
You can trust me Adelaide he said softly
Youve got to believe that
Im in jam as much as you are
If dont get Daggert dont get my job back and that means dont eat
Youve got to help me stick by me
Ill see us both through this mess She nodded took out her hand kerchief and dabbed her eyes
trust you she whispered
For some reason do trust you Adelaide why are you in with this racket
And why was your brother in itwith Daggert The girl held her taut throat as though to loosen it
Because Ted she said slowly was in street brawl once
He was drunk he and another man fought
He beat the man badly and the man died in hospital later
My brother wasnt caught but one of Daggerts men saw the fight
Daggert used that to hold over Teds head made him work all the society rackets for him
Ted couldnt get away But you She closed her eyes then opened them and looked at him
dont have anything to do with Daggert
Please believe that
The girl who was supposed to do my part in this insurance holdup could not show up
Ace Daggert forced Ted under threat of exposing him to make me work as substitute
You see Ace likeshe thinks he see
Daggerts in love with you Yes And you Boyces voice was tight
My brother was killed yester day
There is no further reason for me to obey Daggert
was going in to tell him was through when you saw me Ken Boyce breathed easier
He turned and looked at the door
Stick with me Adelaide he said swiftly
might need you to lo cate something in this apartment for He stopped abruptly as the door swung inward and man came out
The man was abnormally thin ab normally tall
He was dressed in black had brutally ascetic face long and thin with scraggy jaw
He carried physicians black case with him
At sight of the man the girl drew back and uttered sharp ex clamation of surprise
Doctor Tolmanl POPULAR DETECTIVE CHAPTER IV Bullet Search HE physicians thick eyebrows went down in frown as he recognized Adelaide Page
Then perfunctory smile asserted it self
How do you do Miss Page
Coinci dence meeting you here
Just attend ing one of my patients
Shall Hurriedly he made move to go back into the apartment and close the door
Ken Boyce grasped him roughly by the shoulder swung him into the hall
Go on Tolman
Keep on going you arent going back in there and warn anybody Im here
Keep going Dr Tolman glanced at the size of Boyces knotted fists muttered something under his breath then hurried down the hall and rang for the elevator
When the car appeared he got into it and Boyce saw by the indicator that it didnt stop until it reached the first floor
Howd you know him he whis pered to the girl his hand on the knob of the half closed door
He knew he would have to move fast now before the man with the phy sicians bag should get to tele phone
Hes the doctor who signed my brothers death certificate Ade laide said her voice low
Boyce frowned
Thats not all he is
Hes quacka fake doctor
He lost his license long time ago
Hes also mortician
Thats how he makes his money
Hes mem ber of Daggerts mob But Ted the girl cried
left him at Tolmans Well attend to that later
Ive got to take look at Ted
We have to go in here
Keep your chin up and trust me He took out his automatic gently kicked the door open and went in
The girl followed close be hind him
The door opened into small al covelike hallway which was empty
They emerged into large luxuri ous dining room also empty
Three doors led off from the dining room
Boyce contemplated them undecided
The girl indicated one of the doors
Thats the living room she whis pered
Thats where hell most likely be Boyce nodded
He moved silently to the door turned the knob
The door swung inward and he went in with it
It was living room done on an elaborate scale its modern chromium and enamel appointments blending in good taste with the multicolored books row upon row in the tall shelves that clung to the four walls
At one end of the room was large flattopped desk and be hind the desk were long windows draped with scarlet and silver varie gated curtains
Turn around Ace Boyce said
The telephone on the desk started ringing shrilly
And keep away from that phone
Tolmans too late to warn you Ace Daggerts lean figure stand ing immobile before the window started then he swung around and scowled in surprise at Boyce and the girl
His face was bony his eyes small and close together his dark hair coming down to point on his low forehead
He resembled noth ing so much as scrawny powerful demon as he glared from the gun in Ken Boyces hand to the pale resolute face of the girl He gave one glance toward the phone then shrugged
It stopped ringing
Finally thin sardonic smile creased his lips and he nodded
Hello Boyce Ive come to get you Ace
This time its for keeps Get me for what For killing little guy by the name of Herbert Knox
For killing boy named Ted Page Daggerts smile remained set leathery
His voice was fiat with arrogance
Still sucker eh Boyce he MURDER INSURANCE drawled
Still chasing around try ing to pin something on me
Still the Boy Scout trying to make good and nab the bad man
Why dont you wise up and stop this stuff
Ive made fool out of you so many times Im getting fed up with it Ken Boyces eyes were hard his voice low and metallic
You were smart yesterday Ace
You stepped out of that woods and shot Ted Page when the boy was going to come clean and spill the works to me
You shot little Knox who would have been my witness
You packed those stiffs into car and carried them here disposed of them some wayprobably as youve done beforeinto the river so that when theyre found if ever their own mothers wouldnt recognize them
Yeah Ace you did your usual thorough job
But you made one mistake
You didnt kill me Daggert shrugged his right hand slipping almost imperceptibly to the pocket in his dressing gown
Small thanks get he grinned
Youll get your thanksin the hot seat
Keep your hand away from your pocket Daggert nodded easily and delib erately folded his arms
There was slight accusing frown on his face as his eyes wavered to the girl
What are you doing with this twoforanickel insurance detective Adelaide he asked
Thats no way to treat me honey keeping cheap company like that The girls eyes were cold her voice huskier than ever
Were through Ace she said icily
Through do you hear
Ive tolerated you
even memorized those lines and played my part in that insurance holdup of yours
had to or you would have harmed Ted
But yesterday youyou killed my brother
Shot him down in cold Shut up honey Daggerts small eyes were suddenly blazing
The vehemence of the girls attack had disconcerted him for the moment
Who says shot your brother Ken Boyce saidhe told me that Daggerts regained composure had put the girl off balance and she fal tered
Boyce immediately came to her rescue
said it Ace
And can prove it
want the gun you used to kill Ted Page
Your bullets werent found in Herbert Knox
They were slugs from the guns of some of your dead mobsters
But your bullet will be in Ted Pages body Ace
And Ill find it because youre in love with Adelaide and you went soft and allowed her to place his body in Doc Tolmans mortuary in prep aration for decent burial
That slug along with your gun and Ade laides evidence will be enough to electrocute you
Im coming for your gun Ace
Dont move your hands AGGERTS eyes were smolder ing his shoulders heaving under his dressing gown
Suddenly as Boyce came toward him he smiled
Listen Boyce
If youre so sure was in on this thing why dont you call the police Because if you used any of your usual snake tricks and squirmed out of this rap you could make it plenty hot for me for false accusations and arrest
Youve done it before
Im getting the dope this time And without that slug and the gun you havent much of case You know that as well as do
Youre not stupid Daggert laughed dryly amused and suddenly relieved
Okay Boy Scout
Take gander at my gun Carefully Boyce patted the mans figure
The gun in the pocket of the dressing gown was the only weapon Daggert carried
Boyce drew it out and looked at it
It was pocket size caliber automatic
Boyce studied it
Somehow dont think this is the gun Ace he said
Youre too smart to carry the other one when its hot
Ill have look around For twenty minutes he searched through every conceivable hiding place in the apartment
Daggert followed him the sardonic confident POPULAR DETECTIVE grin on his face
At last Ken gave it up
You know of any place he might keep it Adelaide he asked the girl
safe somewhere
secret place Daggerts eyes fixed on Adelaides face and there was tense expres sion about his mouth
The girl con sidered for moment then shook er No she said
dont think so Daggert grinned again
On my desk is box of the caliber bullets use for my little cannon he said
You can take look at those too Boy Scout if you think itll do you any good Boyce looked at him
Daggert seemed too confident suddenly too sure of himself as though he had successfully pulled the wool over Ken Boyces eyes and was reveling in the thought
Boyce didnt like the setup but there seemed little he could do about it
He was stymied
Ill look at them Ace he said
They went into the living room again
Boyce picked up the box of cartridges
He emptied some of them out in his hand
Then he reached over took magnifying glass from the desk and held it in front of one of the bullets
Striations of slug often tell lot he muttered
He put the glass back on the table
If youre all finished Sherlock Daggert sneered you can hand back my gun
And then get out
Im tired of fooling with you
Next time you meddle in my affairs wont be so easy on you OYCE put Daggerts gun on the desk pointed his at the man
Well just leave your gun here until you escort us to the door Ace
Safety first is good motto Daggert turned on his leering smile shrugged and led them to the front door
Boyce looked down at Daggerts feet
Little things lead to big things sometimes he murmured
Im glad you wear the same shoe that do It led me to you
Maybe some other little thing will lead you to the chair Ace
Sorry to have troubled you
Lets get out of here Adelaide Daggerts arrogant grin vanished and scowl appeared
He put his bony hand on the girls shoulder pulled her back tow ard him
Adelaides not going with you punk
Clear out
Adelaides stay ing here
Aint you honey He slipped his arm about her waist
The girls face was livid
She tried to push away
Boyce looked at her
Do you want to stay Adelaide he said
never want to see him again she cried
You heard that Ace Get the hell out of here Boy Scout before lose my temper Deliberately Boyce holstered his gun
Okay Ace he said
Then his left hand darted out grasped Daggerts shoulder jerked him away from the girl
The special investigators right fist connected with Daggerts jaw and the sharp powerful impact knocked the rack eteer halfway across the room where his back smacked the dining table
He sank to the floor his breath wheezing between moans his hands coming up and covering his face
Boyce and the girl hurried out and Boyce rang for the elevator
Not until he had hurried her into cab did he speak
Whats the address of the mor tuary where your brother was taken Eleventh Avenue and Fifty seventh she answered staring at him
He gave the driver the ad dress looked out of the window be hind as they headed across to upper Broadway
We havent got much of start Boyce said
Daggert knows where were going and he knows where Tolman headed straight when there was no answer to his phone call
knew there was no danger of Tol mans coming back himself
Hes too much of coward for that
Either he or some of his men will MURDER INSURANCE follow usprobably get there be fore can find what want The girl leaned closer toward him her eyes soft as they looked into his
hope she said that nothing happens to you
Somehow think youll win out
want you to know that trust you His hand closed over hers
hope he said wont let you down Doctor Tolmans mortuary was dreary building of grey stone and had been converted from an old fashioned mansion
It had bleak morbid look about it
Boyce paid off the driver and he and the girl went in through the open front door
Dr Tolman himself came from somewhere in the rear to meet them
His ascetic face was fixed in thin smile as he greeted them
He showed no sign of surprise at their visit
You have come to take last look at your dear brother no doubt he said to Adelaide with the low monotonous tone of the pro fessional sympathizer completely ignoring their former meeting as though it had never happened
Listen Tolman Boyce rapped forget that stuff
Daggert has probably already called you and told you to stall us off until he gets here or sends somebody for us
So get moving He went up to Tolman and whispered sharply into the lean mans ear
Tolmans expression was pained and shocked
Really my good fellow
cant do that
It isnt ethical and Quit stalling heel Boyce said
He turned to Adelaide
Im whis pering because what have to say isnt pleasant for you to hear think know the girl mur mured
Youyou want the bullet fromfrom Teds Boyce nodded
He gave Tolman shove
Get going before start in the strongarm stuff Boyce was still capitalizing upon Tolmans known cowardice
He knew what he was after but he had to work fast to get the necessary evidence
CHAPTER Quick Thinking HEY moved into dismal shaded room
On heavy table reposed cas ket
prickle of natural distaste for things pertaining to death etched along Ken Boyces neck and spine
He saw the face white and waxen of youth lying in the casket
All right Tolman he said do your stuff
want the bullet from Ted Pages body
know its still there
When you forged the death certificate Im pretty sure you did not take the trouble to remove the slug He glanced at Tolman when the tall man didnt answer
Then he cursed and ducked instinctively
short barrelchested man powerful of arm and leg with the hairy face of gorilla and wearing an in ternes white coat was running for him at crouch
The mans feet had made no sound on the carpeted floor
Before Boyce had time to move the man had dived at him the full weight of his compact animal body catapulting into the insurance investigators chest
Boyce went down and hit the floor hard knocked breathless from the force of the tackle
The man squirmed over his body apelike his muscular arms flaying Boyces face with blows that rocked his senses
Boyce fought back as best he could but he was no match for the strength of the gorillalike man who snarled bestially breathed heavily as he pounded
Suddenly the man stopped using his fists his arms went around Boyces neck in hug that had him choking from strangu lation
Red and black jagged spots flecked before the investigators eyes as his throat contracted and what little breath he Pad left began to
sear in his chest
He saw Ade laide appear at the doorway heard POPULAR DETECTIVE her stifled scream as she took in the situation
He had glimpse of Tol man darting for her suddenly wrapping his long bony arms about her and dragging her into the room
Boyces arms flailed the hairy face on the bullet head above him but his blows became weaker as the steel bands about his neck contracted and shut off every bit of air from his scorched lungs
Things began to wobble crazily and then the room whirled around
With last desperate convulsive wrench of his body he twisted and squirmed managed suddenly to roll over and throw the weight of the man off his chest
He felt the mans body jar as it came into violent contact with something solid
He heard the scraping of wood and there was split second during which he knew something had moved above him and was going to hurl down upon him with devastat ing destruction for anything it crushed below it
It crashed into the bullet head that still hung tenaciously above his
It sent the wind from Boyces lungs with whistling rush
He felt as though some giant monster had walked upon him
Things went black for moment then he was conscious again and aware of terrific weight mashing him against the floor
With the weakened strength he possessed he managed to twist from underneath the weight
He stag gered to his feet hauling out his gun and training it on Tolman tak ing quick glance at his feet as he did so
When he had thrown the interne with that last wrench of his body the man had crashed into the tenuous legs of the table broken one of thi and the casket it had supported had slid off and fallen onto the internes head
He lay under the big metal box twisted and still
Let her go Tolman Boyce clipped
Tolman glared at him and released the girl
Now get your scalpelor whatever you useand remove that bullet before throw one into you He followed Tolman into the next room with its long white table and rows of glistening instruments
Sul lenly and deliberately Tolman se lected small keenedged scalpel
They went back and Tolman bent over the casket
The girl gave sharp pained cry and turned her back
For Gods sake Boyce rasped cant you do that in the next room like you would an autopsy
dont want Adelaide to see CANT
cant Tolman sud denly shouted
Its got to be here Then abruptly he resumed his suave urbane manner and added Excuse me
What mean is it wont take second
can do it here Boyce nodded
There was some thing strange about that he thought
Tolman was too concerned about performing the gruesome postmor tem work without disturbing the body
But he said nothing waited until Tolman finally straightened up extended his hand upon the palm of which lay lead slug
Boyce took it
want thick glass he said
Any kind of heavy drinking glass Tolman went into the next room and Boyce stood at the doorway
Fill it with water he commanded
Tolman did so and handed it to the investigator
Boyce held the slug up against the light put the glass against it magnifying the striations in the lead
This slug came from cali ber revolver he muttered
The kind have seen Ace Daggert carry
The gun Ace showed me was not the gun he used to kill your brother Adelaide He held the glass against the bul let again and the girl looked at it with him
If can only find the gun Ill have evidence against Ace Daggert that will send him to the chair so quick Ill show you the gun Boy Scout
And Ill show you how that gun works Boyce swung around swore luridly
MURDER INSURANCE Slowly he let his automatic drop to the floor and looked squarely into the small gleaming eyes of Ace Dag gert
Daggert grinned sourly held the gun in his hand on the insurance investigator
Tolman take Adelaide and hold her against the wall over there he rapped
But be sure you dont ob struct her view
Theres something going to happen that want her to see
Her boy friend is going to take trip right before her eyes
And hes going to be sent on that trip by the same gun hes been wanting to find
How do vou like that Boy Scout Smiling he edged over to the casket
He bent slightly and his hand groped under the half closed lid of the casket
It came out hold ing revolver revolver that Ken Boyce instantly recognized as being caliber type
Boyce realized then why Tolman had been so reluctant to take the lid off the casket or extract the bul let in the other room
Daggert slowly pocketed his small automatic then deliberately moved close to Ken Boyce raising the revolver until it pointed at the investigators forehead
Im going to make it easy on you sucker
Im going to give it to you in the brain where it wont hurt much
It cant hurt what you havent got
If youd had any brains youd have kept your nose out of my business
But you had to monkey around till you found the gun killed Page with
Now youve found it punk
And now youre going to get it from that same gun The revolver stiffened in Daggerts grasp His finger grew white as he pressed the trigger gently
The sar donic smile on his face had become fiendish
Boyces hands slipped tensely to his sides his fingers grazing the outside of his pockets
Suddenly the taut lines of his face relaxed and slow deliberate grin broke over his face
look of puzzlement and rage came over Daggert
You think its funny do you he roared
It wont be funny when Save your breath Ace Boyce said calmly
Youre not going to harm me with that gun Im not going to Are you crazy Boyce shook his head still smil ing
The sweat on his forehead be lied the coolness of his grin but Daggert didnt notice
Why do you think Boyce said evenly that casket is on the floor
Naturally you wouldnt be able to figure that Daggerts eyes narrowed with suspicion his voice was hoarse
Why Because like Boy Scout did my job thoroughly
found the murder gun You found Of course
And thats why you are not going to shoot me with it
Im sorry Ace but that gun is empty
emptied it ten minutes ago To confirm his words Boyce reached in his pocket took out four bullets and tossed them contemptu ously at Daggerts feet
There are the slugs Ace
The same kind that killed young Page Daggerts face went livid
For moment he stared with insane rage at the calmly grinning face of Ken Boyce
Then he cursed wildly and his hand fumbled in his pocket for his other gun
HAT was all Boyce needed
He dropped to the floor retrieved his own automatic before Daggerts hand came halfway out of his pocket
Boyces gun lanced flame twice
Lead streaked into Ace Daggerts knees
The racketeer screamed sank to the floor hands clutching his wounded knees
Boyce whirled in time to see Tolman making des perate leap for the door
Again his gun jetted fire and Tolman jerked as though he had been stabbed jack knifed to the floor and also clutched at his knee while his voice shrilled hysterical shrieks
Ken Boyce walked over to the moaning Daggert quietly stooped and picked up the racketeers re volver
He pocketed it
POPULAR DETECTIVE little painful that knee busi ness he said softly
But mighty effective
And youll live Ace
You will be able to walk to the chair He came over to the girl took her hand in his and squeezed it gently
You all right Her face was white and tired and frightened but her eyes were little misty
She managed to nod
And you she murmured
He nodded smiled reassuringly
In the hall youll find phone
Better let the police in on this
Ill watch my friends in here When she came back she had re gained her composure
Her voice was still husky but trace of color had come back into her cheeks
When she asked did you get the chance to empty that gun Boyce smiled shook his head
didnt empty it
It was just bluff
And Ace Daggert wasnt used to bluffs
He fell for it But the bullets you took from your pocket They were just like the clue his shoes gave me
From them found out where he lived
told him lit tle things often led to big things
The bullets felt in my pocket gave me the idea of the bluff
And those bullets were the ones that Ace him self gave me in his apartment Adelaide looked up at him her hand in his
The violet had come into her eyes again and tremu lous smile to her lips
Everything is finished now isnt it she said quietly
He grinned drew her close to him
No not everything
First Ive got to see Kelly that boss of mine
Ive few things to say to him
Then For long moment he looked at her squarely

NDER ordinary circum stances Carter Morris did not resemble the popular conception of crook
Known on the Street as the head of Morris and Company reputable brokers his shock of white hair his hard lips and firm chin were generally con strued to be the trademarks of an honest dealer in bonds and stocks
But just now crouched over the desk in his ornate Westchester home Carter Morris did not in the least look the part of respectable Wall Street broker
His white hair was ruffled there was dampness on his forehead not brought about by the June weather
Morris worked feverishly with the papers on the desk
There were bundles of securities pads of bank notes all of large denomination more money in loose piles
Sixty thousand in cash Morris mumbled as he worked
An even hundred thousand in securities
can cash them anywhere
Get this matter straight and Ill grab the first boat for Europe
Ones sailing to The sound of car brought him back to the window in single leap morrow
Thatll give me time He rubbed hand across his face
God he whispered
Ive got to get away before they find out about that Texas oil deal
Hundred and sixty thousand
Thatll keep me for time
Itll blow over
Sure it will
Itll blow over He was trying to bolster up the courage he had felt slipping away during the last hectic week during which time he worked over the books of his company endeavoring to fal sify the accounts stave off the pend ing investigation he knew would shortly take place
Hadnt two of his investors demanded an account ing of their money placed in his keeping on that Texas deal
Morris cursed bitterly
Thirty years on the Street thrown over by one stupid move
Like many others on the Street Morris and Company had been hit hard
Carter Morris had seen chance to make clean up recover some of his losses
It was on the shady side of the ledger
POPULAR DETECTIVE but he had taken itand lost out
Even now the DA
was after those in on the Texas dealand he was one of the principal fish
Morris worked feverishly for an other ten minutes stuffed the money and securities into bag locked it thrust the key into his pocket rose and crossed to the window
Visions of newspaper headlines flashed before his eyes
He saw them as if they were reality and not fig ments of his fevered brain CARTER MORRIS FINANCIER AND FLOWER FANCIER ARRESTED BY As OFFICE Reported Moving Spirit Behind Huge Texas Oil Swindle MILLIONS LOST BY INVESTORS Morris breath choked him sweat made his hands and face clammy
In an effort to divert his mind from the subject he swept the lawns and gardens with swift glance
Everywhere was riot of color
Hundreds of rosebushes clus tered around the lawn
Roses he had trained and watched treated and experimented with
Roses of every color under the sun cross strains he had grown by himself
Roses he lovedhis hobby
Morris tore his gaze from their beauty and stumbled back into the room
As he reached the desk the sound of car rolling across the gravel drive brought him back to the window in single leap
It was big car
It contained four men
Four letters on the side door sent Morris lurching against the window edge grasping the wood for sup port
The four letters were USDA
Morris face lost its color
The district attorneys men he whispered the sound coming from between shaking lips
He whirled to the desk tossed the bag containing the cash and secu rities into lower drawer lacked it
His eyes roved wildly around the room
The front doorbell chimed
The broker lurched again to the window and what he saw there sent his knees weak
One man from the car stood near the bottom of the steps
second wandered around towards the rear of the house out of his sight third bent over rosebush apparently examining the beauty of the flowers
The fourth was not in sight
Wade Morris butler knocked on the door of the study entered
If he noted Morris terrorstricken condi tion he made no sign
gentleman to see you sir his dry voice said
Says its impor tant Morris choked before he replied
Tell him to wait
Ill see him in moment Wade withdrew
Morris pounded the desk with clenched fists
Caught He mouthed the word
No use trying to get away
The man who had gone around to the back would block that exit
There was no other way out of the house except the front and back doors
The windows
No theyd spot him for sure one of them
Bluff it out
He didnt have the nerve
He glared wildly around the room
short barking laugh bubbled from his lips
There was one way out TR
MORRIS will see you in moment sir said Wade to the man at the door
Just wanted to The words were cut short by crackling shot from the study
Both men plunged into the room
Wade jerked back with cry
Carter Morris sat at his desk his head on the blotter
thin trickle of blood seeped from hole in his right temple staining the blotter smoke floated from the gun clenched in his right hand
Morris cried Wade
The other man whistled

He fell handled revolver
It was in flower right under his microscope bed
If it was an outside murderer You think its an inside job then he dropped it makin his get Dr Feather suggested
Or it could have been thrown The sergeant spoke lugubriously from the window of the murder So far Dr Feather know com room FEATURING DOCTOR FEATHER CRIME SPECIALIST POPULAR DETECTIVE You picked it up from where it was lying Dr Feather said
Dear me thats too bad No fingerprints on it that amount to anything
Whats too bad Well if youd left it alone Ser geant maybe we could have told how far it dropped
The trajectory of its fall might have Lord never thought of that Dugan agreed
Well anyways we found it
The victim he must have staggered around the room bit before he fell
Theres several places with blood Staggered around with bullet in his heart
Good heavens Ser geant told you theres some queer stuff in this didnt
Thats why wanted you to come Dr Feather
Oh hello Miss Kit FEATHERS slim darkhaired seventeenyearold daughter
Kit had parked their limousine
She joined them on the moonlit veranda of the big rambling four story Maple Grove home of Dr George Randolph who lay murdered in his laboratory on the second floor
It was two AM placid summer evening
Five people were in the house Dugan said
got em all here in the sittin room
If you discard the two womenI guess you can all rightthen that leaves three men if it was an inside job They passed uniformed man at the front door and traversed hall way
As they entered brightly lighted living room it seemed that the two women there had no guilty knowledge of the tragedy
They were seated on couch in corner
Mrs Green the housekeeper grey haired motherly looking woman dressed in wrapper was holding the hand of young woman beside herRuth Randolph twentyyear old daughter of the murdered phy sician
Ruth was fully dressed but her dark hair was rumpled her eyes red from crying
So obvious was her shock at the loss of her father that Dr Feather impulsively held out his hand
My goodness Im really very sorry Miss Randolph Her tremulous smile held dignity
Thank you she said
Do we have to answer many more ques tions Dear me Ill be as quick as can Two of the men had jumped from their chairs
Both were young and wore dressing gowns over their pa jamas and house slippers
This is Dr John Parker Dugan said
Randolphs assistant for the past two years The young physician had been seated near the murdered mans daughter with hand on her arm as though to comfort her
He was slim pale delicatelooking fellow with sleek brown hair and neat brown mustache
How do you do
Dr Feather he said
Anything that we can do to help And this Dugan said is Mr Randolphs secretary Lee Johnson
Hes been here about two years Johnson was ruddy stocky fel low with mop of curly hair
His smoothshaven face was flushed
He coughed nervously
Weve told Sergeant Dugan everything that happened he said
What want to knoware we sus pected of this thing by any chance
Because if we are Dr
Feather will ask the ques tions Dugan said
Dear me just want to hear you people tell what happened Dr Feather said mildly
The facts were simple
Dr Ran dolph the murdered man had been retired physician
He was wealthy widower with consider able property and large corre spondence so that he needed the ser vices of secretary
And two years ago Dr Randolph had engaged in secret research work and had hired Dr Parker as his assistant
There can be no secret about it now Dr Parker said earnestly
Randolph was seeking virus for the control of cancer tumor pathological abnormalities of cell re production MURDER UNDER THE MICROSCOPE He was successful Dr Feather asked
We had formula Was it something that could get stolen Dugan demanded
The young assistant shook his head
Merely series of pro gressive experiments The circumstances of the crime also were simple
At midnight Dr Randolph had been alone in his lab oratory working with his micro scope
Dr Parker whose bedroom was twenty feet away on the second floor had gone to bed and to sleep
So also had the secretary in his own bedroom about the same dis tance in the other direction along the hail
guess the shot woke me up the secretary said
lay minute getting awake
Then went out into the hall
saw Dr Parker come from his room Thats correct the young phy sician said
The shot woke me
We met out in the hall
The labora tory door was closed
We rushed in and saw The murdered mans daughter gave low cry
Quite so Dr Feather said hast ily
Never mind the details He stared at the two men his head tilted his mild eyes searching them
Both were plainly nervous
Dr Parker was abnormally pale tensed as though his nerves were close to the breaking point
Johnson was not only flushed but his eyes were ab normally bright
BRUPTLY Dr Feather turned from them to Mrs Green
Where were you he asked the housekeeper
She looked frightened
had gone to bedup on the fourth floor the west wing
was took sick with the indigestion
Miss Ruth she went up with her about mid night Ruth said
hadnt un dressed as you see
sat with her You didnt hear the shot Dr Feather asked
dont think so
If we did hear it we must have thought it an auto mobile out in the street
Then Dr Parker and Mr Johnson came rush ing up
Theythey told us Her voice broke her eyes filled with tears
The third man seated across the room big heavyset fellow of perhaps fifty had not spoken
He was wearing pair of trousers with the tails of flannel nightshirt tucked into them
He shifted nerv ously as Dr Feather looked at him
Who are you Dr Feather asked
William Green the man said
Thats my wife He gestured to the housekeeper
Weve been em ployed by Dr Randolph for ten years And where were you when the shot was fired didnt hear it Green said
was asleep
My bedrooms on the fourth floor jus little ways from my wifes But dear me your wife was sick Dr Feather said
She was gettin better by half past twelve Green declared
Miss Ruth was with her so they told me to go to bed
wuz tiredgarden ing all day
First thing heard everybody was poundin on my door shoutin that Dr Randolph was murdered The silent little Kit had been standing at the living room door unobtrusively her alert eyes missing nothing
Abruptly she said
think any such details down here Father Of course child Dr Feather turned
believe Ive heard quite enough
Lets go upstairs Ser geant In the hall Kit said Those men its hard to choose between them Father Dont even try to jump to conclu sions Kit At the door of the murder room Dr Feather paused with Kit beside him as they peered at the mute trag edy
The room was more study than laboratory fairly large square room with single window the door to the hall and one other POPULAR DETECTIVE small door which the sergeant said opened into clothes closet
library of technical books lined one wall
small Xray machine and fluroscopic apparatus stood in one corner
In another was glass cabinet of surgical instruments
There were two upholstered reclin ing chairs several other chairs and one or two tables with electric table lamps and litter of medical maga zines
Small Oriental rugs were scattered on the floor
HE single window was directly opposite the hall door the lower sash partly up
On the floor few feet in front of the window lay the crumpled body of Dr Randolph small thin man in his fifties
He was dressed in felt slippers trou sers and dark blue shirt open at the throat with his sleeves rolled partly up his forearms
small chair was nearby
Beside the body was an overturned small wooden table
The doctors microscope had crashed to the floor almost upon the body
Shot in the back Dugan was saying
Claus who was here says the bullet entered just to the left of the spine went through the heart
Dr Feather and Kit silently were peering down at the face of the dead man
Abruptly they looked at each other
Dear me Sergeant you couldnt get an idea from which direction the bullet came
The window or the doorexactly opposite posi tions No way to tell Dugan said
But he must have spun as he fell knocked over that table and micro scope He gestured to the win dow
Take look
Its straight twentyfive feet to the ground but an active man could climb up theys rainpipes an ivy trellises But Dr Feather and Kit seemed not listening
They were kneeling over the body examining the bullet hole and the crimson stain on the dark shirt between the shoulder blades then peering intently at the dead face
Dr Feather carefully pulled an eyelid outward to expose more of the eyeball
Then he was examining the dead mans scrawny throat was feeling the dead mans muscles
Hes been dead about an hour Sergeant Hour an quarter maybe
The shot came about one am
They all agree on that Queer that he should have been strangled Kit Dr Feather mur mured
Very queer Father Sergeant Dugans jaw dropped
Strangled bruise on the throat Dr Feather said
See it here Dr
Claus mentioned that the sergeant declared
Like when he fell maybe the microscope might have hit him Dr Feather smiled faintly
That or fingers squeezing his windpipe hand violently over his mouth
My goodness when youve seen as many such contusions as have Kit child take look around the room will you
The sergeant said blood was scattered Dugan gestured
Some over there on the floor Miss Kit
little dried smear two or three of em around like somethin dripped blood And yet the shot caused instant death Dr Feather said
In fact the wound seems to have bled lit tle less than normal rather than low exclamation from Kit in terrupted him
The girl was still kneeling over the body she had lifted the loose half rolledup shirt sleeve
On the flesh of the left fore arm just below the elbow was small scratch hardly more than an abrasion which had drawn only small amount of blood quickly dry ing
Dr Feather stared
Well Kit Dilated pupils Father
Locked muscles
was sure wed find Of course child
But the blood around the room is more puzzling
Let me think Dugan was across the room bend ing down to the floor midway be tween the hall door and the clothes MURDER UNDER THE MICROSCOPE closet
Heres some of the blood Miss Kit It was small smear as though few drops had fallen
Carefully Kit examined it
Then like little hound she was searching the floor
drop here on the rug Father It was close to the body
Then she found one nearer the clothes closet door
Dr Feather was examining the microscope and the glass microscope slide which lay by the instrument
He was using his oil immersion lens Sergeant the highest powered combination ROM across the room by the clothes closet door Kit suddenly exclaimed smear of blood here partly under the door Father
The door must have been open Little Dr Feather leaped to his feet
Dont touch that closet Kit
Keep away What the devil now Dugan gasped
Dr Feather confronted him his cheeks flushed his mild blue eyes flashing
My goodness the answer cer tainly lies right here somewhere
Microscopic evidence
Kit well need lot of apparatus from the car Yes Father Youll have to make the analyses Kit Sergeant Duganthat clothes closet
Did you go in there just poked my flashlight in
told you left everything for you Just opened the door little Yyes
But what Dear me thats excellent Ser geant
Good luck indeed
The door was closed when you got here Yes
Say listen Dr Feather what are you Please dont question me when Im questioning you Sergeant
My goodness thats annoying
How big iq flip Small
Just few feet
Clothes hangin on racks shoes on the floor Good
Bring those three men suspects up here

My goodness certainly can
lot of queer business went on here
Kit hurry down to the car child
Get our exhaust pump for that air
Bring your paraffin outfit the big microscope all the apparatus for analysesand bring the haemocy tometer Yes Father Youll have quite bit of work Kit
want to make paraffin casts
If can determine which one fired the shot That would clear everything up Father
And the simple medical ex aminations Of course child
Weve got this murderer
Dear me Sergeant dont stand gawping at us like that
Bring up those men suspects Kit had hurried from the room to get the apparatus from their big limousine which was in effect traveling laboratory
She came back in few minutes erecting her ap paratus in an unoccupied bedroom across the hall
Dugan meanwhile had brought up the three grim frightened men
Dr Feather had been standing motionless in the center of the room pondering
As the men appeared he hopped to confront them
Ah here you are
What want to knowwhich one of you fired the shot The abrupt question startled them so that each gave low exclamation staring at each other
Stand aside Sergeant Dr Feather ordered
His manner was amazingly different now crisp menacing
One of you is mur derer
Which one Murderer the pallid Dr Parker echoed
Youre accusing us Lee John son demanded
One of you Dr Feather said
But what happened in this room tonight is anything but simple
Which one of you fired the fatal shot Sergeant Dugan jumped at them
Come clean
Which one He swung on Lee Johnson
You may be POPULAR DETECTIVE havent fired gun in five years Johnson protested
Nor Dr Parker declared
There wuz no weapon in the house that ever heard of the stal wart gardener said
My girl Kit has few little tests she wants to make Dr Feather said crisply
You three men wont mind of course
Come here Kit Id like to make them in the room over there Kit said
ILENTLY they followed into the opposite bedroom with Dr Feather and the awed Dugan watch ing from the doorway
It was to Dugan and the three suspects cer tainly strange series of tests to which the deft girl now put them
Quickly she took their blood pres sure their temperature then with sterile needle stabbed the lobe of their ears and with stethoscope listened to their hearts and respira tion
Quite physician young Dr Parker sneered
didnt know this was medical case Youll know lot more when Dr Feather gets through with you Dugan commented
have the wax ready Kit said quietly
Shall make the casts now Father No Ill do it
You get that sam ple of air All right Father
But if he opened the closet door very wide then probably Try it anyhow Kit
Just cor roborating evidence
My goodness well certainly have plenty of evi dence Yes Father With belllike exhaust pump in her hand the girl hurried across the hall to the murder room
Closet young Dr Parker mur mured
But no one answered him
On bureau of the bedroom Kit had erected small alcohol lamp over which in retort paraffin was heating
just want to apply it to your hands for few minutes Dr Feather said
Hold out both hands pleaseyes all three of you Quickly he coated the six hands with the paraffin an eighth of an inch thick encasing the backs of the hands and all of each thumb and forefinger
Well leave it on about ten min utes he said
Come here please From across the hallway Kit was excitedly calling
You three sit still Dr Feather warned
Hold your hands motion less or youll break the mold
What is it child In the closet Father found this in an old shoe She spoke softly as she held out small tri angular fragment of broken glass
Dr Feather gasped
Why dear me
Easy Kitwatch out Im careful Father
He hid it there quite evidently
And blood dropped on the floor in there quite lot of blood And the air child Deficiency of oxygen Father surplus of carbon dioxide quite ob vious even without test
He must have been shut up in there at least five minutes or more
Its instinctive to open door only little when you slip out furtively and quickly
The air didnt get altered much when he left Quite so child
Well weve got every link now havent we
Take your microscope in there and com plete everything Yes Father The three men were grimly seated waiting their hands held motion less
dont know what this is all about Green muttered
Nor anyone else guess Lee Johnson retorted
believe thats long enough Dr Feather said
Your perspiring hands will have loosened the par affin and cleansed the pores Carefully he peeled off the cas ings
Then with little brush dipped in chemical he began swabbing the interior of the paraffin casts
This is solution of dipheny lamine and sulphuric acid he in formed
Watch what it does MURDER UNDER THE MICROSCOPE There were six casts
On five of them it did nothing
But the inte rior of the sixth in moment was dotted with blue spots
Microscopic bits of gun powder Dr Feather said into the tense si lence
blowback from the firing chamber of the gun driven into the pores of the skin
They couldnt be washed offcouldnt be seen even microscopically
But the perspira tion brought them out onto the par affin the chemical made them visible and my goodness there they are Lee Johnson and Green were star ing at Dr Parker
Whywhy the young phy sician gasped numbly
You fired that shot Dr Feather said
Dear me youve got to admit it now Got you Dugan exclaimed tri umphantly
Ill be damned Dr Feather that was quick work The sergeant was jingling hand cuffs but little Dr Feather pushed him away
Not so fast Sergeant
Does every test have to try to prove man guilty
My goodness this was just the opposite
This was to prove one of them innocent
Youre lucky Dr Parker Amazement spread over Parkers face
Whywhy yes did shoot him he mumbled
But it was an acci dentI swear it was
thought he was burglar there at the window
shot too quickly
swear didnt mean to kill him You didnt Dr Feather said gently
You thought you did but you didnt
Tell us exactly what hap pened to you Parker had been sleeping rest lessly he said
His room was hot and he had opened his hall door
Then he heard dim crash
He had bought revolver about week be fore had said nothing about it be cause he had no license
When he heard the noise he had seized the revolver rushed out into the hall
He heard the laboratory door open as though someone were coming out someone who heard him and ducked back in again
knew it wouldnt be Dr Ran dolph he said
rushed on think ing only of burglar Youre lucky Dr Feather com mented drily
Youre not the kind of man to own revolver ITH more courage than wits the doctor had recklessly plunged to the laboratory doorway
The room was dark
At the window hed seen blob of figure crouching at the sill had impulsively fired dashed forward seized the blob
Dr Randolph had tumbled at his feet dying
The horrified Parker had stood moment gazing at the bullet wound in his employers back
As though it were viper he had flung the revolver far out the win dow then he had fled terrified back to his room
Who would ever be lieve it was accidental
He even had motive for murder
He was en gaged to Ruth Randolph
Her in heritance would make her rich now
And Parker himself had sole posses sion of Dr Randolphs medical dis covery which had great commercial possibilities
Well Dugan said when the dazed Dr Parker finished thats grand yarn
When you said nobodyd believe it you hit the nail square But it happens to be true Dr Feather said
My goodness it fits the facts
It has to be true Kit stood again in the doorway
Ive just about finished Father
Heres all the data Dr Feather scanned the cards of her penciled notations
Thanks Kit
Not much argument is there No Father Dr Feathers eyes were flashing as he faced Lee Johnson the secre tary and Green the gardener
We had three suspects he said
Now weve got two
You dont have to say anything
My goodness Im not trying to trap you into con fession
can tell you now pretty exactly what happened
My girl Kit and Iunfortunately weve seen so many murdered menthis ones di lated pupils his locked rigid mus Continued on page DEATH on the Complete Novelette of Criminal Espionage By STEVE FISHER Author of Merry Christmas Killer The Man in the Window etc
CHAPTER Peter Case ETER CASE was not well
His mind was filled with the nervous confusion that is born of an aching restlessness
There was nothing he could do about it except wait for something to happen
It was suspense he did not like because he had no way of telling what was going to happen
The storm was liable to break at any minute
It might come from any quarter
And when it came the foreboding that was now deep with in him promised it would be de luge of the worst sort of trouble
He paced the lanai terrace burn ing up one cigarette after another and looking each minute or so out past the shining sands of Waikiki Beach at the dark water and the lights of the ships that crawled along the horizon and disappeared past the looming shadow of Dia mond Head
Peter Case pressed He had two ideas concerning the possible origin of the trouble to comethe submarine which had left Pearl Harbor by nowand the disappearance of Gladys Ben ton wife of the Ss skipper
But that disappearance should not be bothering him
As the captain had said it was probably due to an im pulsive notion of her own that Ocean Depths Conceal Fiendish Plot the trigger of the automatic prompted her to go to one of the other islands for vacation
Since Benton was not worried there was no real reason for Peter Case of Naval Intelligence to be con cerned
In the first place even if the worst had happened even if she had been abducted or murdered her plight would not be brought to his official attention
But Peter Case was thinking of one angle which would mean that her disappearance might have lot to do with the business for which he had come to Honolulu
Foreign spies in the city were as thick as flies and it was possible that the wife of naval officer would be valuable tc them
Particularly if she happened to be the wife of the Ss skipper in the Battery Room of Submarine
POPULAR DETECTIVE for the spies were all here for the same reasonafter the invention the carried with her tonight the same invention Peter Case was com missioned to buy for the United States the moment it was tried and approved
He lifted his binoculars and looked again out to sea
Isimo he snapped suddenly Isimo
Here she comes Case was giant and his straight strapping figure was silhouetted by the light from the room that ad joined the terrace
He wore white mess
jacket and blue broadcloth trousers
He was blond his high cheekboned face definitely Nordic
He looked both youthful and hand some though in hardened way for his face was like fine leather
Hurry Isimo he said still peer ing through the glasses
The terrace door opened and small Filipino garbed in navy whites came rushing out gibbering My goodness
She come so queek sir Case handed him the glasses
Peek for yourself General ENERAL ISIMO who by his own statement commanded troops in the far reaches of the Philippine Islands long before the temptation of steady salary as mess boy in the American Navy intervened in his questionably brilliant career had been allowed to accompany Peter Case when he was taken from ac tive naval service and put in the Intelligence
Isimo was to be Cases mess boy personal valet and ser vant but he had served in that capacity only few months when he graduated from all that by blandly announcing that he would be henceforth ganteelmans gan teelman
He was looking through the binoculars now
Brave General Isimo is glad he ees not on sad vessel Cases eyes flickered
Why he demanded
No like number no like idea
Like shore side and palm trees He handed back the glasses and returned to the room leaving Case not little uncomfortaole for the boy had an uncanny ability for predict ing disaster in subtle way
Case too had feeling that all might not go right with the He looked again toward the death laden little submarine cruising se renely through the spash of moon light
Suddenly grim foreboding gripped him
He felt as though he wanted to shout to it order it back to port
He kept watching as the shadows swallowed the dim little running lights and he was conscious that sweat trickled down his face
The was on an experimental cruise
Within her bulkheads was the first completed model of per fect sounding instrument
It was the product of an inventor who lay dying in the Queens Hospital of spinal paralysis and if it worked the United States wanted it badly
But if the trial proved to be fail ure it was quite possible that the would be destroyed with all lives aboard
The permanent value of sound ing machine had long been subject for naval discussion
All were agreed that an effective instrument of this kind would be leading factor in winning or losing war at sea
In recent years various types of sounding machines had been invented
None of them had gained complete success
The type of machine that Peter Case was commissioned to Inspect and which had been installed in the had the broadest sound range of any in the world
Use of this equipment made it possible for submarine lying either on the surface or bottom of the sea to pick up the sound of every vessel cruising within radius of hundred miles
Using this informa tion as basis it would be possible to determine with fair accuracy the approximate size of the cruising vessels and their course
In the event of war the value of machine that could supply such in formation was obvious
sub marine so equipped would be able to inform the battle fleet of the exact position and definite approach DEATH ON THE of the enemy ships would make it possible to catch such ships by sur prise or would permit minelayers to place deep water mines in the path of enemy craft causing them to be blown to bits when they crossed these uncharted minefields
Vaguely Peter Case heard the tinkle of the phone from inside but the clapping of palm fronds and the strumming of guitars on Waikiki Beach below him carried the sound away in the warm breeze
mo ment later however General Isimo appeared at the door
Come queek he said Missy Gladys Benton missing wife of Ss captain on the phone Case moved quickly forward
OR hours Gladys Benton had been waiting to be left alone for moment and now that mo ment had come
She had strug gled with the ropes that bound her until they were loose
And now with the man who had been guard ing her out of the room for an in stant she had to make use of her time She jerked the ropes from her aching body and stood up
For moment the blood rushed from her head and she was so weak that she thought she would faint
Strands of black hair hung about her livid white face she brushed them back and moved toward the window
It would be brief freedom and it would end in death
This she knew and yet she was un afraid
If she had known fear be fore her captors had beaten it out of her so that now but single flame bright and hot burned in her soul
The flame of vengeance
Her dress ripped to the hip as she climbed onto the window sill
She stared into the night and then down at the ground below her
In moment she had let herself fall and now she as on that ground and getting to her feet
She could feel her heart pounding pounding
She must hurry
Even now the was under way with her husband Bill Benton in command
Poor Bill
She ran stumbled across the ground fever beating white hot in her mind
God bless you Bill she kept thinking God bless you and damn me
My rotten betrayal my filthy schemes and intrigue were not big enough to touch you
She was sobbing now
The night breeze whined across the cliff that was the Pali and the leaves of thousand trees rustled like the laughter of gods
Somewhere over the top of this mound and down through the woods there must be house where there would be phone
That was all she wanted phone
She must find it before they discovered her escape before they could find her and kill her
To be caught now that she had gotten away from them would mean certain death
Before if she had remained their captive there might have been chance of living
She might have been sent back to the foreign country in whose employ she had originally been when she married Bill Benton to spy on him
You are traitor her chief agent had charged
No she had answered evenly am woman and in all the wars of the world in all the suffering and bloodshed and shame through which men like you have tried to use women there has never yet been found way to rob them of their souls
didnt promise that would be party to blasting into bits submarine filled with living men
Nor could possibly know when married him that Bill Benton would be the man he is and that would fall in love with him Our nation is not interested in your emotions the agent had snapped if the invention on the Thirteen explodes the United States will not exercise the option to pur chase it
Then we Yes know then weyou your country could have it
But the price you are asking the price of mens lives in time of peace is too great It had gone on like that for hours
They wanted to know what she had told Benton
She hadnt told him anything and she wished now that POPULAR DETECTIVE she had but they had kidnaped her sensing in some uncanny way that she was ready to reveal their whole rotten plot to him
So Bill Benton knew nothing
The lights of house flickered yellow through the night
Sucking breath into her lungs she stumbled toward it
She reached it and pounded on the door
gaunt Hawaiian answered and she hysterically demanded the use of the telephone
The stupefied native pointed the instrument out to her
And few moments later she was talking to Peter Case
CHAPTER II Murder on Deck IEUTENANT BILL BENTON in the conning tower of the somehow did not like the silky smoothness of the night sea nor the moon that was so white too white
He had been skip per of the for long time so that he sensed when something was wrong
He felt that something was wrong now something more than the nat ural apprehension of the experimen tal dive they were coming out here to make
Bill Benton was stocky man he had sloping shoulders and short firm arms
He was young and ex tremely sincere about everything he undertook
His eyes were black wideset and his lips thin
He had full ruddy cheeks and his skin had been bronzed by the sun
He glanced now at Stacy stand ing alongside of him
Stacy junior lieutenant was his executive officer who had been aboard only few months
He looked at Brad shaw the tall slim quartermaster now at the steering lever
There was someone aboard who didnt be long though Bill Benton did not know whether either one of these two knew that or not
This feeling about the sub was not one that had come to him sud denly it had been coming for days
During those days he had been care ful to observe almost everything that took place
At least he had tried and he was beginning to real ize that one or more men who were either spies or were being bribed by foreign agents were in the com plement of the new volunteer crew
He leaned back now his thoughts coming slowly
The swish of water along the ships side slithered above the deep hum of the Diesel engines below
The steady breeze was rat tling the driedout canvas of the signal bags
At last Benton said Take over Stacy
Im going be low Yes sir
Shall leave the deck hatches open Might as well Benton grunted admit theres not much air to be pulled below but at the same time theres no chance of water spilling over the deck so long as the sea re mains like this He climbed down through the conning tower hatch reaching the bottom in the square Center Op erating Controls room
He rubbed his feet on the greasy deck and glanced around him
The radioman was in his glassenclosed shack and sailor was sitting on ditty box on one side of the room jotting down some notes
Other than that the room was empty and the shiny steel of the walls the cross bars of the periscope and the heavy throb throbthrob of the Diesel engines op pressed him
He headed toward the door lead ing into the forward battery and as he walked he felt the sub sway gently from side to side and he heard the swishheavier now against the hull as the boat pushed through the calm water
He stopped at the tiny officers wardroom which was separated from the rest of the forward bat tery by strips of canvas and looked inside
Mari Mason was sitting alone at the oak table cup of hot coffee in front of her
DEATH ON THE Hello he said his voice little thick and the hot oilladen air catching in his throat mind if join you As matter of fact Lieutenant she said was just going to re quest that you do
There is much we must talk over before the dive He entered and sat down
There may not be dive he said
She looked at him incredulously
Mari Mason was the daughter and only real assistant that Fred Mason the inventor of the new type sound ing machine ever had
Her hair was rich with golden yellow con trasting with the fine color of her skin the deep green of her eyes
She was slim and although she looked very young she was the type of girl who at glance one would call competent
What do you meanthere may not be dive she asked
ILL BENTONS black eyes had soft gleam and his thin lips parted in half grin
Perhaps dont mean exactly that he replied ringing for mess boy but think rather feel cer tain that there is someone aboard who doesnt belong here
And that means trouble Do you know this persons iden tity believe do
But there may be more than one
At least shall arrest one man presently and then will feel safer about the dive The Filipino boy arrived took the order for coffee and disappeared
When he returned with the steaming liquid Benton and Mari Mason sat in silence staring at one another
At length Benton shrugged
dont mean to alarm you it may not be anything at all She leaned forward her lovely face tense her green eyes flickering
Do you think anyone could have heard what you said she whis pered
Bill Benton shook his head
Again there was silence for one came to regard the throbbing of the Diesels as part of the elements
Like time and space they seemed to go on forever
The sub kept rocking gently rocking and water swished along the hull
didnt speak loud enough for anyone but you to hear
had thought of that She nodded but did not look as though she were convinced
She drew in her breath and coughed it out
At last she got to her feet
Is it all right if go up on deck
am supposed to get the pitch and roll an hour prior to the divethough dont suppose there is much pitch and roll now
Besides want to get breath of air and smoke cigarette dont blame you Bill Benton grinned and rose
The air seems pretty putrid down here until you get used to it
Ill go up with you They left the wardroom together going forward
Mari Mason wore blue slacks and slipover sweater
green band held her hair close to her head
She ducked through the watertight door and into the torpedo room
Bill Benton followed his eyes on the grimfaced sailors who sat about playing an old battered phon ograph
Beyond them stood the four gleam ing doors of the torpedo tubes and the sleek greasy fish themselves were lashed to the bulkheads
In this compartment you could see how the hull of the boat curved like bloated cigar
The sailors were sit ting on bunks on ditty boxes
Over the incessant pounding throbbing beat of the Diesels the music screeched from the phonograph St
Louis woman with diamond ring Mari Mason grasped the iron rungs of the ladder and began to climb
Some of the sailors watched others paid no attention they were too tense the mission of the boat too grim to notice much of anything right then
As the girl climbed through the manhole hatch and out onto the deck Bill Benton his officers cap cocked back on his head climbed the ladder and followed her
It was quiet on deck quiet away from the Diesels with only the bubbling POPULAR DETECTIVE swish of the water and the soft hum of the wind as it slid past the looming hulk of the grey conning tower
Mari Mason lit cigarette
Its nice night she said
Bill Benton shivered involuntar ily
He had been about to add nice night for murder but some how he didnt
He glanced up at the bridge the red and green running lights flickering the figures of Stacy and Bradshaw
At last his gaze returned to the girl who was facing forward now
As for pitch and roll he said weakly you were right And as for the fresh air she replied over her shoulder its de licious The night was beautiful and for moment neither of them spoke
The kept sliding onward through the water and neither Bill Benton nor Mari Mason saw the slim figure that darted across the after part of the deck to the side of the conning tower
Back to the tower the figure crept quietly around the side of it
For moment that was eternity he waited
Then noiselessly he un sheathed knife and gripped it in his hand
He moved forward stealth ily raised the knife then he struck
The blade sliced squarely between Bill Bentons shoulder blades
Jerking the weapon out the killer hurriedly raced back for the engine room hatch
He flung the knife over the side and disappeared below deck
Mari Mason turned to speak to the skipper
She looked quickly around and then suddenly she saw his huddled form on the deck
She screamed
CHAPTER III Death on the Pali ETER CASE said into the phone But where are you Mrs Benton
Where can reach you It doesnt matter about me she said theyll kill me be fore you can pos sibly arrive
And deserve no more than that
What you must do is get to that submarine
Their peril is far greater than my own Yes Case said can stop the boat but They are coming now she said thickly can hear them
Tell the police it was on the Pali
They shall perhaps find me here
But as for you for Gods sake see that The line suddenly went dead
Peter Case was up strapping an automatic about his waist putting on leather jacket
General Isimo followed him to the door
Case turned
Phone Wailupe
Tell them have ordered the immediate return of the to Pearl Harbor
Under no circumstances are they to dive Double check said Isimo but where you going For social call to the Pali Case clipped Im going to call on some spies General Isimo was wideeyed
call police double queek
Maybe need some help in call huh But the Intelligence ace had left
few minutes later he was roar ing up the road to the Pali
cot tage loomed in the glare of his head lights
Two figures lay sprawled in front of it
Case swung in at the side of the road his brakes squeal ing
He leaped from the car drawing his
But he had no need for it
tall Hawaiian lay halfway down the porch steps his head battered and bloody and his body already stiff
On the ground near him lay Gladys Benton the front of her DEATH ON THE dress crimson and her black hair disheveled
Her face was very white her lips smear of crimson
Her eyes were still open and Case saw them blink
He holstered his gun and bent over her
She was not quite dead and she stared at him through glazed eyes
chill ran through his body as he looked down at her
He felt himself trembling all of sudden
He did not know what to say speech seemed so useless in these ebbing moments
He felt unaccountably embar rassed as though he should not be here watching beautiful woman die
He took her into his arms and he felt her blood on his hands warm and sticky
Her lips were quivering now and he leaned close to catch her whisper
Bubbles of blood flecked from her mouth
The spies areshack here She sucked in breath and Case felt somehow that it would be her last
Her voice became huskier So the terrible machine of murder that is war grinds on with neither pity nor mercy with ruthlessness that She was choking her voice coming like short sobs from deep in her throat
Cases face was flushed and his heart was beating very fast
He could hear the wind on the Pali and the rattle of leaves
have been such fool Peter Case she went on at last such selfish shortsighted little But her voice stopped there and Case saw her eyes close they were like the eyes of child who is very sleepy
Her muscles relaxed and when he bent down he could not feel her breath
He took her wrist and felt it grow cold in his own warm grasp
In moment he was able to get to his feet
He was too stunned to think coherently
Over and over he heard her voice and the whining of the wind and the rustle of banyans and he knew that he was walking in the direction of the shack she had pointed out
He knew that his gun was in his hand again and that something cold ached in his chest
He saw the shack from the top of hill
Figures moved about inside
One of them came out carrying bag
It seemed to weigh him down
There were three men altogether
He gripped the service little tighter
He did not know how he was going to accomplish the capture of these men but strangely enough it did not seem to matter
Gov ernment agent isnt paid to think of his own life
He started forward
He had gone scarcely four steps when Thompson machinegun loomed from an open window of the shack
ITH the first spasm of the gun Case was no longer man
He was cold and grim fighting ma chine of the Naval Intelligence
He was on his stomach crawling across the ground
The tommygun bullets screamed over his head
It was as though hell had broken loose
He lifted the automatic rolled back
The gun belched with flame and the man with the machinegun dropped it
There was bullet in his head
Case saw that as the spy gunner slipped down beneath the window sill out of sight
But the machinegun had been silenced less than second when the other two spies both outside now sent shots screaming into the darkness where Case lay
The shadows were Cases allies
In the light of the house he could see the other two men quite plainly Crawling rolling across the ground sucking breath into his great lungs holding the automatic tight in his sweaty hand he moved inexorably closer to them
He opened fire again
Three solid blasts
The man with the suitcase whirled about wounded
The im pact of the bullet sent him to the ground whare he at once struggled to regain his feet
The other spy looked around wildly
Then there was crashing of twigs behind Case and the roar of police guns
Case got to his feet and rafted forward
The spy who had not beer wounded was running in straight line back through the trees
Case POPULAR DETECTIVE stood and triggered the remaining shots in his gun at him
Then he whirled in time to kick weapon out of the hand of the man he had wounded
He jerked the spy to his feet
Dirty pup he breathed
It was the first he had spoken since get ting out of the car
The police arrived five huge Hawaiians
Case jerked his head in the direction the last spy had es caped
See if you can get him HREE of the Hawaiians raced off through the trees
The other two stayed to handcuff the man Case had wounded and to drag the corpse of the machinegunner from the shack
Case was looking at the suit case
Thats undoubtedly filled with lot of photographs and maps the government will be interested in he said keep it in safe place for me The detective captain nodded
Will do Case
what mess you ran into up here Cases eyes flickered little grimly and then he saw General Isimo running toward the shack
Meester Case
Meester Case he squealed
So happy to see you vertical slant not horizontal
Have bad news
Much work What is it The little Filipino was breathing hard
Called Wailupe as you said
But they can get no rise from the Ss radio It had not occurred to Case that he might not be able to radio the and order her return to safety
Now new and more horrible fear gripped him
He and Isimo would have to fly out to the sub at once
Come on he said thickly
They returned to the car
Case headed it down the Pali and toward the air island at Pearl Harbor
Twentyfive minutes later the motor of their Boeing sputtered caught on and roared
Case eased back the stick geared the trim sea plane forward
It skimmed rapidly across the dark water and as it leaped gracefully into the air Gen eral Isimo in the navigators seat held on with both hands
His oily black hair waving in the wind he screeched out his excitement
Sucking the cool night air into his lungs Case hand on the stick led the ship nose up toward the stars
It lifted in slant like child hur rying up flight of steps
They reached the mouth of Pearl Harbor in no time and looking over the side Case saw the beam of the lighthouse
His feet worked on the tail assem bly steerage and he guided the craft in heavy bank to the left
Motor pounding hard then propeller whirl ing he opened up
They swept over Aloha Tower in minute or two and winged swiftly out over the dark sea
Since the radio was dead on the ship there was naturally no way of being sure of its exact position
But Peter Case knew the course they had planned to take and he now checked his own gyro and set bear ings to follow it
According to his own calculations the submarine would by now be nearing LaHiana Roads off the picturesque island of Maui
Nearing the position he had ex pected them to be Peter Case at length brought the Boeing on slant toward the water
They lost altitude rapidly and he could hear the loose flipping of the guy wires the rattle of piece of canvas some where near the undercarriage
He adjusted the goggles he had bor rowed and looked down over the side
The sea was black and empty
Bringing the plane down to where he was no more than hundred feet above the water he skimmed along at ninety miles an hour watching on every side of him and directly below for the missing sub marine
Before he realized it he had com pletely passed the island of Maui
Cold terror or perhaps it was foreboding of terror gripped him suddenly
Thick lips tight he brought the plane about dropped even closer to the water and started back
He covered the same route DEATH ON THE he had flown before in almost no time and by now his concern had greatly grown
He was about to lift the wings of the Boeing and turn about again when he spotted red and green run ning lights on the horizon of the sea ahead of him
And as he saw it he realized why the submarine had not been where he had thought it would be
It had turned about and started back toward Pearl Harbor
That might mean there was more wrong on board than temporarily silenced radio
He eased the Boeing gently to the water skimmed rapidly over the top of it once the pontoons had bumped down
Taxiing up alongside he sig naled the bridge by means of blinker code with flashlight then cut the motor
Almost at once sailors appeared on deck climbing up through the torpedo tube and after battery hatches
Hoist the plane aboard Peter Case called
He climbed out across the wing and leaped to the sloping side of the
Feet planted on the hull he pulled himself to the deck
General Isimo leaped immediately afterward
He caught with one hand and squealed until two of the sailors helped him aboard
His shoes were soaking wet
Shoes go on expense bill he chanted unhappily ruined in line of duty CHAPTER IV Attempt at Escape HILE the sailors rigged small deck crane Peter Case went to the torpedo room hatch and climbed below
The torpedo room was empty
The battered phonograph was grinding at the end of record making no sound except shrill scratching
General Isimo descended the ladder like monkey
Case went in through the forward battery to the small wardroom
He glanced inside drew back then stared
Lieutenant Bentons bloody corpse lay on one of the lower bunks
While he looked at this Juniorlieutenant Stacy came through the COC
He was captain of the craft now and had climbed down from the conning tower
Mari Mason followed on his heels blue slacks sweeping across the greasy deck
Her face was very white
Peter Case looked around and his Nordic face was set
Who did it he asked thickly
dont know said Stacy
He was short had red hair and grey eyes looked as though he had just come out of the academy
Although he must have been nearly thirty his face was very boyish
It happened on deck Mari Mason said was there when it happened
Bill Benton had been talking of arresting some man whom he said did not belong on board For moment Peter Case said nothing then he declared Your killer probably credited Benton with more knowledge concerning his iden tity than the lieutenant really had General Isimo shifted nervously from one wet foot to the other
Cases next words were sharp
He addressed the juniorlieutenant And you were going in Thats right Stacy said
How was the radio silenced Someone slugged the radioman and smashed it
Nothing very subtle about this business must say Stacys youthful face looked strained
With the killer still on board Peter Case said acidly you were going in to port where he would have chance to get ashore and escape Stacy shrugged
Well didnt know what else we should do sir Case said sharply Regulations state that when crime occurs at sea the Intelligence should be notv fled at once and when that is im possible every attempt should be made to solve the crime before com ing to port POPULAR DETECTIVE As he spoke Case felt the in tensity of the atmosphere as though high voltage wires were strung taut and to the breaking point
Every where in the face of every man there seemed to be death expres sions that were bleak or resigned or of fear
The men had volunteered to take chance on the sub but none had bargained for murder and all hated its presence
The red haired juniorlieutenant looked up
You meanwere going to remain at sea until Until the murder is solved Case said slowly
Stacys eyes burned curiously
Under the circumstances sir should say that such plan was dangerous
We have that invention aboard you know There are spies on board Case replied
If we touch port theyll have the chance of escaping in which case their ring would still exist im periling the entire navy But they might kill more of us
They might You are quite right Peter Cases eyes flickered grimly
We are all in grave danger Stacy but as have told you there is more behind this than murder
We must risk our lives because these spies must be captured see sir Stacy murmured softly
And for moment there was only silence punctuated by the heavy throbthrobthrob of the Diesel en gines
Then the sailors evidently having finished their jobs lashing the plane aboard the phonograph in the torpedo room was going
Low toned voices sounded everywhere
The pigboat rocked gently back and forth water rushing along the sides
Mari Mason spoke softly
Then there will be no dive to test the sounding machine dont know Case replied cant tell yet
We have been prom ised that if we do go through with it the ship will be exploded
Yet he pausedthat may be the very method we shall have to employ to catch the killer Stacy protested Good Lord man
In that case Case halted him with motion
During dive he snapped there is absolute silence
Every man is supposed to be at his station
An irregular movement by any sailor will throw suspicion upon him
After all the ship cant be blown up by someone merely wishing it
Action must be applied and Yes but if they should succeed Case shrugged
It is our busi ness to see that they dont Lieutenant Stacy was shaken
He turned and went back into the COC
Case turned to the girl
Sorry you have to be here Miss Mason
My boy can fly you ashore if must be here for the trial of the invention she replied
Cases blue eyes were warm
admire your spirit he said softly
At that moment the buzzer of the ships phone sounded in the ward room
Case stepped inside the small room picked the instrument up
Yes Someone is trying to get away with the plane tense voice said Im going to try and stop him
Bet ter get the men on deck and The voice stopped and Peter Case turned raced through the forward battery into the torpedo room and up the ladder
Sailors gaped after him
He reached the deck to find that the Boeing had been secured aft
In the dim light of the moon he could see two figures struggling
Lieutenant Stacy in the conning tower was shouting down at the fighters
ETER CASE leaped forward swept around the blunt hulk of the tower but even as he did so he saw one of the figures near the plane tall slim oneslump down in heap
The other figure vanished into the nearby after battery hatch
The ropes securing the plane had been slashed and the Boeing swayed pre cariously toward the subs side
Leaping over the figure on deck Case careened around the plane and leaped into the manhole hatch of the after battery
He crashed with deafening thud on the steel plates of DEATH ON THE the deck below
sailor whose bunk was over the galley table stirred
The ships cook in dungarees and an apron had been sitting at the table reading he looked up
Another sailor was at the door of the COC
machinists mate stuck in his head from the engine room
Ankles smarting Case pulled him self to his feet stared at the group of faces about him
Where did he go Who asked the cook
Case groaned
The man who came down just second before did The sailors looked at one another
didnt even notice him said the cook was reading
The fellows go up and down that ladder all the time
They go up on topside to smoke was asleep the man in the bunk added
And didnt see anybody said the machinist
Peter Case looked at the chunky unshaven sailor who stood near the door of the COC
Cases Nordic countenance was tight mask of disgust
What about you
he demanded
The unshaven man shrugged
just came in he said slowly
His piggish eyes gleamed with amuse ment
Why looking for somebody sir For murderer Peter Case re plied
The heavy pounding of the Diesels throbbed into his ear drums the hot air from the engine room caught in his throat and choked him
His heart had started to beat little faster and he felt as though his skin was burning
The sailors ap peared to be dumbstruck at what he had said and no one opened his mouth for long time
Throb throbthrob pounded the Diesels
Peter Case looked the men over carefully for some moments then he said One or all of you is lying
Be fore very long Im going to find out who it is
And when do its going to be long and sad story ft seems rather incredible in spite of the fact that the Diesels make so much noise that man could come down that ladder without being seen or heard He turned to the cook who was skinny and had morbid black eyes
Whats your name Page sir the cook answered
Case looked at the chunky un shaven sailor
Your nameand rate Martin sir
Im torpedoman first class glanced at the bunk
The sailor there was lean medium sized
He had heavy jaw dark eyes and short clipped hair
My name is Lambert sir he said
am also torpedoman
Second class Do you usually sleep in your dungarees Lambert Case asked
Well Im going on watch pretty quickly
Im due to go on at twelve and was just getting cats nap see Case grunted turning to the machinists mate who was huge
He had black hair and his face and hands were covered with grease
You My name is Ryan sir Page Martin Lambert and Ryan Peter Case said aloud
He paused looked from one to the other framing leading questions by which he could trap the guilty one so tightly that it would be impossi ble to lie out of it
But suddenly with his thoughts came another idea
It hit him all of sudden and hit him hard
It seemed to write key to the solution of the identity of the Ss mystery killer
If it worked he would have the murderer redhanded
It meant also that instead of just one spy being aboard there were at least two
Case felt that at least one of these was among the four present Tor pedoman Lambert Machinist Ryan Cook Page and Torpedoman Mar tin
The knowledge made him tin gle with excitement
He turned and climbed the ladder to the deck of the craft
He could see part of Maui on the horizon the palms POPULAR DETECTIVE tall and straight the dust of stars carpeted behind them
Mari Mason and some of the sailors were grouped around the still figure that lay near the plane
flashlight was turned down on the face
Bradshaw someone said he was the quartermaster on watch in the conning tower when he saw the figure cutting the plane loose from the temporary stays Case glanced at the small iron boom to which the sailors had raised the Boeing and strapped it
Bradshaw is dead said some one else
He was cottonhaired young ensign whom Peter had not seen before
CHAPTER Secure All Hatches ARI MASON spoke up
This is so un fortunate Mr Case
So much of this hap pening
Dont you think we should go in
Postpone the trial of the inven tion until later
Im sure my Father had no idea this experi mental cruise would be such gruesome one Im sure he didnt either Peter Case said softly but as for going in Im afraid must be contrary
What we are going to do is dive Dive echoed the ensign get ting to his feet
The sailors looked up as though someone had lashed whip across their faces
Case nodded and then seeing flash of white down the deck called Isimo
General Isimo The little Filipino came on the run
Yes sir
General Isimo ganteelmans ganteelman awaits command sir Were going to put the Boeing back over the side Case said and youre going to take it back to Pearl Harbor He saw disappointment flicker on the brown face and added hurriedly Think you can fly it all right General Isimo can fly anything he answered quickly adding sir Case himself had taught Isimo lot of things during their spare time in Washington but knowing the Filipinos pride in these accomplishments he had appealed to his vanity
In another few minutes the sailors were lowering the ship over the side and into the water
The had come to stop
The Boeing had been raised from the water in the same way that lifeboat on larger vessel is taken up over the side
The sailors hauled the lines through the pulleys and then when the ship was in place strapped it to the deck with stays
Now it was lowered back down the sailors easing off on the lines until the pontoons rested in the gently rolling water
One man held the plane off with boat hook so it wouldnt scrape against the side of the submarine while General Isimo scrambled down the sloping side of the like brown monkey
His feet sloshed into the water
For moment it looked as though he would plunge in and he screeched
But in the next mo ment he had leaped caught the wing which dipped with his weight and crawled across it and into the cock pit
Case waved at him
If dont see you again he said grinning you can have my tuxedo Without pause Isimo shouted back It would be feeting theeng for them to bury me in Case smiled as he always did at the boys sentiment about him
In the next instant the motor of the plane roared
Isimo waved then taxied smoothly down the water gradually lifting the wings into the air
Case walked forward with Mari Mason
He nodded toward the con ning tower ladder
She climbed up it into the bridge and he followed
Stacy looked at them
expect to be ready to dive in few minutes Case told him
First want Mari to show me the lay out of the invention below deck
will DEATH ON THE signal you from the wardroom when we are ready to go under Yes sir the reddiaired skipper snapped but dont you think its inadvisable to The dive Case said is net in which hope to bag two killers
As for its advisability Ill take that responsibility on my own shoulders That would be wonderful Stacy said acidly if we all were killed
What good would didnt ask for an opinion Mr Stacy
Youre here to take orders Mari Mason climbed through the round hatchway down into the COC
and Case followed her
Color was beginning to come back into her face as though she had suddenly begun to believe in him
She showed him the invention and briefly ex plained the main points
While they were talking the cottonhaired young ensign walked through the compart ment headed aft to his station on the engines
Whats his name Case asked
Ted Bronson she told him
They went on discussing the in vention and he told her his plan
She was very excited about it though he thought he could detect trace of doubt in her face
Finally they made complete tour of the vessel from the torpedo room to the battery room
think were ready Case said
HE tried to smile he gripped her hand
They went into the ward room
They looked toward the two corpses as though sealing silent oath
The sub rocked gently in the calm of the sea and the air was hot
Case could hear the faint sound of the phonograph from the torpedo room St
Louis woman with diamond ring He looked at Mari
Well here goes he said
She touched his hand looked up into his eyes her fingers tightened over his
Okay Skipper she as sented
He talked into the phone to the bridge
moment later the word was passed that electrified the crew
Secure all hatches
Man your stations for diving Quickly and silently the sailors went to their stations in various parts of the ship
Mari Mason left the wardroom
Though woman her sweater slacks and the green band about her yellow hair some how made her look quite equal to the job of looking after her fathers interest concerning the sounding in struments
Peter Case followed her into the COC
where already the ten sailors assigned to thisthe most vital position on board during divewere taking their places near the controls
It is hot below decks hotter in tropic sea and most of the men in spite of Mari Masons presence were garbed as they usually were during dive dungaree trousers white skivie shirts some of them wore handkerchiefs about their necks to sponge the sweat that rolled from them
Peter Case could not help but notice the tenseness in the atmos phere the grim hardened looks on the white faces as they prepared for thisperhaps the Ss last dive
They seemed resigned fatalistically so
Yet one could not help but no tice the etched lines in their coun tenances the traces of fear in the muscles of their cheeks the occa sional slight quiver of lips
Lieutenant Stacy crawled down through the conning tower tube bolting the last hatch after him
For moment he stood in the mid dle of the deck his hat cocked back showing his red hair his grey eyes hot
He looked at the smashed radio through the glassenclosed door and at last glancing not at Case nor Mari Mason went to the periscope
He grasped the cross bars and sat down
Almost at once the huge pounding Diesels went off went si lent
It was almost as though thundering river had instantly frozen over
The sudden quiet was ominous portentous
It brought reality to half numbed minds
The batteries were on now the batteries POPULAR DETECTIVE which operated the ship when it was under water
Stacy leaned forward and as he spoke gave the orders to the men talked into the voice tube to Bron son in the battery room his voice seemed to come from deep in his throat as though something was clogged there and was muffling his words
Diving planes he said
As he spoke and the men re sponded automatically to the com mand great iron planes like wings unfolded from the side of the pig boat so that as it went under it was not unlike giant fish with straight and sturdy fins that guided its course under the water
Peter Case looked around him
He observed the men their sweating faces their eyes in which death seemed to dwell
The sub nosed down its blunt little bow wallowing into the waves under them and gradually the whole black and grey hull slid from sight until only the thin pipeline of the periscope remained above water cut ting through the surface with the slithering hiss of serpent
At that moment when the sub marine was completely encased in the limpid water chill seemed to freeze the air blowing from no where through the compartments like the damp breath of death
Peter Case shivered involuntarily and be gan to sweat
He looked at the glistening steel bulkheads oozing now with beads of perspiration and steam water dripping dripping down the sides and rolling in rivu lets to the deck
It was as though the pressure of the sea were closing in about them as though the ocean would crush the sides and sweep into the square compartment of the coc
Mari Mason stood near Case not moving watching with wide green eyes
Her face appeared more calm than any of the countenances of the sailors her eyes brighter and less afraid
She would not try the in vention until they were on the bottom
Ease her now Stacy said slant thirty degrees for the bottom and he leaned forward pressing his eye to the rubber about the periscope eye his arms about the heavy cross bars
CHAPTER VI On the Bottom EEPER still deeper the dove rocking back and forth as it made its way rocking like cradle of death the water laving against the iron bulkheads loud swishing that told Case what was out side
The bloated cigar form of the boat sank deeper through the murk of undersea fish swam away from it around it eyes goggling seaweed swept aside
An octopus and shark hurried away from the path of the great iron monster
No one spoke except Stacy giving his orders and now Peter Case kept watching the men and waiting
He unholstered the automatic and then gripped it in his hand
The sailors looked at it looked up into his face
Their eyes were flickering crazily
So the worst was expected
Their stare seemed to say that and in all the cold the damp heavy air that froze them sweat came more pro fusely
Bottom was reached at last the boat thudded gently into the mud and at once Stacy put the ship in reverse
With the aft end high it brought them ort of it and now his voice growing gradually more quiet Stacy straightened the vessel to an even keel
Not even the peri scope was above the surface now
They were completely under
Stacy leaned back wiped sweat from his face
Well Mari Mason moved forward her lovely face composed her green eyes on Stacy
will put the sounding machine in motion she said
The sub kept rocking on the bot tom water kept oozing down the DEATH ON THE sides of th
glistening walls the sailors stood tensely dungaree trousers white skivie shirts wet with sweat
Wait minute said Peter Case
want an accounting of the men in the torpedo room Stacy stared then he spoke into the voice tube called out the names one by one
His voice echoed hol lowly from the empty bulkheads
All right Case said when he was through all right Mari
Set the sounding machine in motion
Pick up all craft within range and prepare your report for the board of officers in Pearl Harbor
This is your first real experiment on this machine make it good one She grinned though there was no humor on her face
Okay Skipper Stacy looked up thinking he had been addressed
But she had spoken to Peter Case
She moved toward panel in which the operating mechan ism for the device had been installed
Case not watching her now walked to the door of the after battery
At just that momentthe moment Mari Mason turned on the sounding ma chinethe overhead lights flickered grew dim
Case looked about
The sailors seemed rigid
Maris hand was to her mouth and she had turned pale
Stacys eyes were wide
Then the lights plunged out
The ship was in total darkness
An hysterical scream broke from the lips of one of the younger sailors
Oh for the love of God get us out of here
Well be killed
Get us out Although Peter Case had not ex pected the lights to go out the fact that they did did not change his course of action
It compli cated it and made it more dangerous
Standing at the after battery door the automatic gripped in his hand he snapped Every man remain at his sta tion
You too Mari
You too Stacy
Dont move until you hear from me Yet in spite of his sharp words there seemed to be minor bedlam
The sailors were muttering there Continued on page have REDUCED MY WAIST INCHES WITH THE WEIL BELT

POPULAR DETECTIVE Continued from page was the shuffle of feet and all of it all of the sound was intensified by the silence of the boat
The sub kept rocking and the water on the outside of the hull brushed against it
Case did not wait
Turning he groped into the after battery past the sailors on the huge electrical control panels
Give me flash light somebody He went farther and someone pressed flashlight into his hand
Peter Case turned it on
He saw the galley stove over in one corner the bleached white table and the bunk that was high above it directly over the table
He saw the coffee urn and the white faces of the sailors in the battery
ND then he left the room went through the door to the engine room compartment
On both sides of him were the huge silent Diesel engines and Peter Case walked the catrunway the strip of steel that lay between them
The beam of his light penetrated feebly through the darkness down to the end of the engine room where lay the closed watertight door leading to the bat tery room
The battery room was the farthest compartment aft
Enginemen and machinists mates stared at Peter Case blond giant Nordic face set tight flashlight in one hand gun in the other he swept forward
The submarine kept rock ing rocking on the bottom of the sea
Now there was the deep hum of the Mason sounding machine which in war times would make submarine almost hundred percent more effective by giving them the exact position of all vessels within radius of over hundred miles
By this tokenif the invention were successsubmarine craft would be promoted to far more import ant place in the defensive and offen sive fighting fleets
Case reached the door of the bat tery room
It was dogged shut with wrenches
As quietly as possible he turned them loose pulled the wrenches from their places so that the door would open
He had to holster the gun while he did it and he worked there for several minutes
Then gripping the gun again and snapping off the flashlight he shoved the door open stepped inside the battery room and slammed the door shut behind him
For moment he stood leaning back against it the gun tight in his hand
It was so dark that he could see nothing nor did he hear anything
He was wait ing for some sound
At last it came deep voice
Who is it Peter Case did not answer and at that moment wrench slugged into the iron door just over his head
He ducked to one side crouched back against the bulkhead kept waiting
The submarine rocked back and forth
At last Case flipped on the flashlight sent it rolling across the deck
Red flashed hideously and shots followed it
The roar in the small compartment was almost earshat tering
Peter Case pressed the trig ger of the automatic fired at the figure he had seen shadowed be hind the red flare of gunfire
He heard groan cursing but the cursing broke off in throaty scream
figure hurtled forward landed on him
Peter Case rose with the man still clinging to him
Hands gripped at his neck and Case using jiu jitsu to break the grip did it easily by placing his own arms between those that clutched at his throat
He swept his arms outward and the fingers lost their grip the clinging figure dropped to the deck
Peter Case slashed his gun down
UT the blow missed and he felt the man holding his legs
Words came from the grapplers lips
Shoot him now
Shoot high But as the gun of the second man opened up Peter Case had swept aside landed on the deck and was trying to crawl back to where the man with the gun was crouched
The other kept clinging to Peters legs and now clawing tried to climb up on him
wrench lashed out
DEATH ON THE Peter Case felt blood trickle down the side of his head but the blow had been glancing one
Viciously now he grabbed the shoulder of the man who had hit at him
He caught the second blow as it descended wrested the wrench away
It clattered to the deck and Casehis hand still on the shoulder so that he knew in which direction to hitbrought the butt of his gun down mercilessly
He felt it crack on the skull felt the warm blood that trickled through his fingers
The mans grip sud denly loosened and Peter Case kicked him away kicked him to the center of the deck
The man was out but there still remained another adversary
This one had not ven tured forward but lay back hold ing gun and waiting for chance to use it
For moment there was silence and ruse suggested itself to Case
He would try to imitate the voice of the man with whom he had been fighting and whom he had just slugged unconscious
If he did not succeed he would be inviting gunfire and possible death
But if he were suc cessful He whispered thickly Ive got him all right
Fix that cord on the lights
The explosion must have come off
We have nothing to worry about The answer came after mo ments hesitation John Yes Case whispered
You say fix the lights for the whole ship Sure But we we didnt hear the explo sion We wouldnt back here Case snapped
Again there was silence and then movement
Gun gripped in his hand Peter Case was crouched
What happened came so rapidly that he had no opportunity to use it
Two shots roared out thudded into his body
He went limp
Blackness screened his conscious thoughts and then very slowly began to clear leaving horrible debris of pain so intense he felt he would cry out

iKl The Magazine of Science InventionExperiments NOW ON SALEAT NEW LOW PRICE POPULAR DETECTIVE Continued from page When he gazed slowly upward his eyes feverish able only to gather half of his thoughts hazy vision swayed over him
The lights had been turned on
The cottonhaired ensign Ted Bronson stood over him weapon gripped in his hand
waited until heard you say enough to know you werent Lam bert he whispered and to de termine your exact position so that my shots wouldnt miss this time
It was clever trick Case trying to make me think you were my part ner but it is perhaps the last trick you will ever use
Youre dying now Case but Im not even going to wait for that
Im going to put bullet through your rotten head The words seemed to be soft patter that fell about him like rain drops on paper
He was not able to hear all Bronson said
He knew only that the ensign was desperate if not hysterical knew that he was capable of murder and more
He saw Torpedoman Lambertwho had been in the upper bunk of the after battery when Peter had last seen himlying nearby unconscious and splattered like himself with bright blood
And then though he did not know how he did it he struggled to get to his feet
It was more the power of strong mind than physical strength
for his strength was ebbing like water running from punctured cardboard cup
Ensign Ted Bronson seeing his feeble effort laughed harshly and lifted Case
He shoved him back up against the bulkhead
Case watched through glazed eyes and he felt sweat bathing his hard face
He saw Bronson the cotton hair the wild gleam in his eyes
He saw the gun Bronson held
And in Bronsons face he saw death
CHAPTER VII The Killers klASES mind might have told him farewell Peter Case death is here with you on the bottom of the sea but his heart told him that even in death he must tri umph
He must point out to Bron son that even if he single and unimportant cog in the great crimefighting machinery that is called the Naval Intelligence was killed Bronsons victory had been snatched from him
He began talking in whisper at first Your spy ring numbered five he said one was killed and one was captured ashore the wounded Lambert there is the third
You Bronson are the fourth
Only the fifth man remains free for the pres ent
poor showing for five men who were commissioned to see that the United States did not buy the sounding machine Bronson rocked back on his heels and wiped his mouth
He seemed fascinated and Case could see that the death of one of his companions ashore and the capture of another was news to him
Bronson seemed to become more nervous
He twisted the gun up in his hand
Yes but success or not Case he said think youll have to tell the rest of your story in hell
Be cause Your plans to explode the COC Case went on dramatically dont you want to know why they didnt work Ill tell you Case hurried on and there was deathless smile on his painwracked face
The ex plosion which was meant to wreck that one compartment could not be effected until the boat dove
But DEATH ON THE Im ahead of myself
Earlier you became aware that Lieutenant Bill Benton was suspicious of you and was about to make an arrest
So you killed him There was strange light in Bronsons eyes
His hand gripped the gun tighter
What if did
That doesnt answer the question of why Im coming to that Case said and he managed to straighten up now
You wanted to engineer the explosion from back here so you would not be harmed
The only victims would be the men in and near the COC
You and Lambert lead wire from the invention into thisthe battery room
You also had Lambert lead wire in from the electrical controls so you could plunge out the lights simplify your problem by working under cover of darkness

You didnt count on my coming aboard RONSON tried to break in but Case had no intention of giving him even temporary advantage
When crossed you up you might have covered yourself by hav ing Lambert escape through tor pedo tube or the emergency crash lock
That would lead Naval Intel ligence to believe that the killer of Bill Benton had gotten away leav ing you the remaining spy aboard free of suspicion and in position to continue negotiations for the de sired plans
You could blame the explosion on deficiency in the in vention Yes but Thats where your plans began going wrong Case said hoarsely because Lambert was unable to re lease the plane quickly enough
When Bradshaw tried to catch him he had to kill Bradshaw and escape Into the after battery
When ar rived in that battery scant moment after he did no one had seen him although several men were present
admit that at first was puzzled
Then it was plain what he had done
He had swung from the ladder that led down into the compartment right into the upper bunk
That was the only way he could come through the hatch without the others seeing him Bronson was becoming impatient
His eyes seethed
Thats fair de duction Case but Case felt the submarine swing back and forth felt the water press ing in against the sides
Mari Mason and he continued found the line you had strung to the invention and with which you intended to explode it from aft here
As say you could blame the in vention for the explosion you and Lambert would have been saved with the others who remained alive with out anyone knowing your identities get it Bronson said from deep in his throat and before the sub dove you cut the lines making ex plosion impossible
But you didnt know we had line to the lights so they went out all right
In that case there has been no Case nodded grimly
There has been no explosion
knew that since Lambert was not in the tor pedo room he was here to escape the effects of the explosion
You two were able to join this crew with faked service records and transfer papers such as spies have used in the past Suddenly Cases voice slowed and stopped
Eyes wide with horror he saw that Bronson had found the break in the wire to the invention and was piecing it together again
There was no explosion eh
No explosion Case saw vision of the result
The COC
blowing up
Mari Ma son and the others being killed
The boat lurching crazily on the bottom of the sea fumes escaping every where
He saw someone in the dark trying to blow the ballasts to bring them to the surface
These things he saw in his mind
For the moment he did not con sider himself in danger because he knew that the doublehull of the would probably prevent any break in the outer wall of the craft itself
The delicate mechanism in the control room would be dam aged but unless Bronson planned to die martyr to the cause he must have arranged his own escape
While he cudgeled his mind for this explanation he was inching for ward
Bronson looked up at him leering at his weakness considering his puny efforts as impotent unim portant
Think Im trapped too Bron son gritted
Case said nothing con centrating his efforts on preserving his strength for one final hopeless attack
This submarine has been equipped for other experiments be sides that of the sounding device Bronson reminded him
We have the new emergency control rooms that work the ballast tanks
The mechanism is right behind that door
step and can start the to the surface
We are only resting in about thirty fathoms of water DEATH ON THE Case halted half in surprise and half in horror
The cyclorama of destruction still left figments of the bloody picture in his semiconscious mind
The ends of those wires as sumed gargantuan size like the twin horns of mighty sea devil
He knew what would happen if Bronson succeeded in what he was now doing
The fury of his inflamed brain gave him the power to move forward
Bleeding his face strained he plunged down at the spy
Bronson whirled about snarling the gun in his hand
It shrieked with shot that whirled fraction of an inch from Cases head
Then Case was throttling the spy even as he felt Bronson crumple beneath him even as he felt his fingers on the ensigns throat blackness and pain surged into his mind so that he did not know whether he could go through with his job whether his consciousness would remain long enough
His was blind and insane fury without reason but coupled with crushing action
Bronsons head crashed on the steel deck he choked out strug gled
Case was still on top of him only shred of consciousness left in him
But that shred was like stick of dynamite
HEN Peter Case next opened his eyes he was in the Naval Hospital in Pearl Harbor
There were two people present one on either side of his bed each holding one of his hands
He looked up into the radiant face of Mari Mason
The invention is success she whispered
Case smiled then too he looked at the person on the left
General Isimos brown face was wreathed in smiles but tears ran down his cheeks
Have good sleep Boss Good sleep Case said
Have surprise Isimo went on wiping the tears

He got scratched on the arm with sharp bit of glass

Within minute or two Randolph died
In that minute the murderer held him from screaming Im beginnin to see it Dugan murmured
That scratch you
showed us on his arm signs of fin gers at his throat Quite so Sergeant
While the swift poison was killing Dr Ran dolph the murderer kept him silent
Then when he was unconscious would say that the murderer dragged him and hung him over the window sill
The murderers idea evidently was to make it look like an acci dentDr
Randolph scratching him self with broken microscope slide on which he had deadly poison
And it would have looked as though dying he had crawled to the win dow gasping for air
Dear me that would have looked reasonable
The murderer maybe would have placed the poisoned bit of glass on the floor or in the dead mans hand
But things went wrong for this murderer
In his haste he knocked over the microscope

Exciting Stories of Federals in Action GMEN At All StandsPrice Continued from page derer heard someone coming
He lad no time to escape so he ducked into the clothes closet
There was little trail of blood leading there so we knew it could only have been made with the door open
We know by Kits findings of the closet air that he stayed in there quite time
That was while Dr Parker fired into the dying man discovered his horrible error and rushed away
Then the murderer slipped furtively out of the closet
He didnt disturb its air much
Kit found in the closet traces of the micrococcus catarrhalis and strep tococcus dont understand any of this the burly gardener muttered
Dear me probably not Dr Feather smiled
Those are com mon germs
Anyway you can un derstand that while he was in the closet the murderer got rid of his damning murder weaponthe poi soned fragment of glass
He hid it in shoe Into the stricken silence as Dr Feather momentarily paused
Dugan murmured But who is he
How can you conclusive test Sergeant
This murderer was bleeding
In his panic stricken haste as he ran around the room his blood was dropping
There was quite bit of it in the clothes closet
My girl Kit got perfect sample Dr Feathers voice was edged now with grim menace
These three men have blood that is very different
Kit took few drops from the earlobes of each and made blood count
Yours Dr Parker as you no doubt know is deficient in the number of erythocytes red cor puscles
The pigment the haemog lobin of them also is deficient in redness
You are anemic
That was apparent just looking at your pallor
But otherwise you are in good health Dr Feathers grim gaze turned to the burly flushed gardener
You Green youre in perfect health so far as your blood shows
Red and CANDID CAMERA CATCHES COEDS in white corpuscles both normal
And you Johnson The flushed secretary was half out of his chair
Youre go ing to tell me Your blood is red enough Dr Feather said
But it happens you have temporary ailment pretty well established bronchial catarrh
mean sort of bronchitis and the white corpuscles in your blood have increased in number to fight the in fection
Traces of the germs from you were in the air of the closet
And wholly conclusive the blood from your ear matches with mathe matical perfection the blood scat tered around the murder room The terrified secretary had leaped to his feet
He made an impulsive move to dart past Dugan but the alert little Kit barred him
And then Dugan seized him
So he did it Dr Parker ex claimed
Ill tell you why Dr Feather
Hes been gambling and drawing unauthorized checks on Dr Randolphs account
He runs the checkbook pays the bills
Dr Ran dolph only goes over the account very infrequently
But the bank got suspicious of the unusual drafts and bills didnt get paid
Dr Randolph told me that in confidence

By accountancy vve do not mean bookkeep ing For accountancy begins where bookkeeping leaves oiT
The skilled accountant takes the figures handed him by the bookkeeper and analyzes and interprets them
He knows how much the costs in the various departments should amount to how they may be lowered
He knows what profits should be expected from given enterprise how they may be increased
He knows in given business what per cent of ones working capital can safely be tied up in mer chandise on hand what per cent is safe and ade quate for sales promotion
And these by the way are but two of scores of percentagefigures where with he points the way to successful operation
He knows the intricacies of govern ment taxation
He knows how to survey the trans actions of business over given Mriod how to show in cold hard figures the progress it has made and where it is going
He knows how to use these findings as basis for con structive policies
In short the trained accountant is the controlling engineer of business one man business cannot do without
Small wonder that he commands salary two to ten times as great as that of the book keeper
Indeed as an independent operator head of his own ac counting firm he may earn as much as the president of the big and influential bank in his community or the operating man ager of great rail road

Modern Foremanship Personnel Manage ment Expert Bookkeeping Coaching Business English Stenotypy Effective Speaking Railway Accounting The Story Behind the Story OURTHDIMENSIONAL tales time traveling stories interplanetary yarns biological fantasies astronomical catastrophes what is the why for all these varieties of science fiction
We read an interplanetary novelette are fascinated by some of the stimulating ideas contained therein then sit back and admire the writers ingenuity
That vast percentage of the readers of THRILLING WONDER STORIES are vitally concerned regarding the origins backgrounds and themes of the stories they read has already been demonstrated con clusively by their numerous letters of ap probation since the inception of this de partment
Its an absorbing game going behind the scenes looking right over the authors shoulder at the halfstarted page in his typewriter
But heres word of warning
Dont anesthetize the effect of the stories by consulting the following letters prior to reading the works they tel
In several letters the authors tip their hands and what is intended to be surprise in the story is frankly discussed
So turn back here only after youve read the entire issue
UNIVERSAL DOOM UDGMENT SUN by EANDO BIND ER is mighty interesting story from its dramatic start to the surprising climax
Heres how Mr Binder explains the gen esis of his novelette The idea behind JUDGMENT SUN was one of those that strike suddenly
had been vacuously casting about for good plot but wanted to get away from the usual themes
How about something really appalling in the way of Earthly dooms but at the same time something close to the ground
It may have been my subconscious grilling that suddenly gave life to the idea of the sun falling down on Earth There was menace or terror that was personal one that each reader would feel menaced him
From there it was natural step to split the story into separate episodes to indicate how universal how far reaching the doom was
It was human interest theme and as such had to be developed from the angle of human emo tion rather than action
The jungle scene sug gested Itself immediately for what can shake mans guilt out of his secret soul quicker than the knowledge of doom and judgment
And so with the other scenes
Each was the choice out of dozens or hundreds of similar episodes that might he occurring anywhere on Earth during those tumultuous hours
The science of the story is frankly subordi nate to the human interest
It called for no more stretch of imagination than the usual doom story but had to be plausible for the sake of realism
For that reason the etherstrain explanation had to be complete but sketchy in order to take up as little space as possible
have always been of the opinion right or wrong that science fiction needs much more of human interest
With the influence that the late Weinbaum exercised on sciencefiction am glad to note definite trend toward the humanizing of its once so cold and lifeless characters
We need scientists that are not wooden puppets villains that are humanly yet viciously motivated heroes that go more by the heart than by the mind and menaces that hit us between the eyes
do not mean that we should stop exploring the immeasurable reaches of space or halt the progress of superscience or limit the boundless delving of imagination in our stories but do believe we at the other side of the editorial desk should not hesitate to have our characters act in accordance with human nature
Too often our hero follows psychology path laid out by framework of science and fails to be fundamentally human
At any rate the story of THE JUDGMENT SUN attempts to show the probable reaction of humanity to the panic of worlds end as charac terized by few chosen examples of ifs collec tive hordes
If it creates in the reader the slightest thrill of personal danger it has hit its mark
Otherwise it has missed it completely and ingloriously
FUTURE VARFARE UTHUR ZAGATS novelette THE FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE is plausible account of what might hap pen in future war between forces de pending mainly on scientific weapons for supremacy
Heres what Mr Zagat has to say regarding the development of his story The pattern of life does not change though the environment perhaps even the form of Man undergoes constant mutation
Through the ages the fundamentals of this thing we call living remain the same loyaltv and treachery selflessness and greed patriotism and treason selfseeking and selfsacrifice friendship and enmity love and hate adventure and desuetude
It was the conflict and inlerplay of these that furnished with the warp of his tales the earliest CroMagnon storyweaver crouching shaggy and brutefaced in the communal cave and dis pelling with the magic of his grunted mono syllabic speech the tribes shuddering dread of the sabretooth tiger whose roar beat out of the fearful dark against the portal boulder
They composed the lay of the silkribboned troubadour strumming his lyre In the castles highraftered hall while armored sentries paced the battlements
They furbish the pages of printed books and vibrate through the ether on the wings of modern miracle
Tomorrow who knows by what unthoughtof medium they will reach the brains and hearts and dreams of men
But always they were and are
and wiD be unaltered
Once upon time Attilas hordes swept ravening to the conquest of world
Once Alexander and Genghis Khan fought for uni versal empire
Once Napoleon closed fist knuckled with cannon upon all Europe
Today listen to the pound of the forge the roar of the furnace fires the hissing of chemists acids fashioning new weapons tor an old at tack
And tomorrow
Tomorrow it will be the same as yesterday
In the near future the wouldbe conqueror may come from some race newly reborn to lust for dominance

But come he will
And he will be fought with courage
With devotion and skill and ingenuity set against the might he deems overwhelming but always and ever with courage
When the fight is over won or lost some yarnspinner whose primal germ lies unguessed in your loins or mine or that of the elevator boy who just closed the gate in your anteroom will sing the saga of those newer heroes
To anticipate some narrator who lies curled in the womb of Things to Be to peer little behind the veil that screens That Which Is to Happen wrote FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE
That adventure will not occur to be sure
But some other adventure whose human fundamentals will be just the same is as cer tain to occur as that in this next instant will complete this sentence
MYSTERy MAN OF SPACE ANDERER OF THE VOID by Dr ARCH CARR the cover story for this issue carries surprise ending that were certain few readers will anticipate
Heres how Dr Carr planned his inter planetary short wanted to write story about space piracy and lone wolf crusader wdio for reasons knowm only to himself waged fierce and singlehanded warfare against these buccaneers of the skies
This crusader would be man of mystery of course his identity unknown on any planet
It would be necessary therefore to mask him for he must often come in contact with space patrolmen and others
The idea of making him metal man gov erned by an organic brain seemed good
But where was to get the human intelligence which must inhabit this brain
Then made use of an idea that had had in mind for some time that of liberating the human in telligence by subjecting the body to an electri cal wave whose frequency was the same as that of the body upon which it was directed
This too seemed good could take the in telligence from someone who had been victim ized by pirates and thus provide my crusader with his motive
The story was started and action precipitated by having the child become affected by har monic of the wave directed upon her father
And so it was in this manner that WANDERER OF THE VOID came to be written
DYING PLANET eil JONES fascinating novelette of Earths last stand and of Mans first space migration was written after some considerable attention had been de voted to the theme by the author
Jones did careful job on this as youll realize from reading this THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS explains itself
It is the conception of dying world with hu manity still persisting in spite of adversity
It is proved that planets have age that they be come old and uninhabitable
Their best ages of existence fade away
Wells The Time Machine afforded me much food for thought on the subject
It is extremely doubtful that mankind will carry on for five million years or million more years for that matter
Aa group he is Ilka the Jug that is carried to the well too often
There are too many things which may happen to him
Yet there still remains possibility that he may struggle onward for five million years
Regarding this possibility have pre sented but one viewpoint of what might hap pen what he might be like yet there is nothing too definite on which to base this assumption
Too many things can happen to change history environment and man himself
Mans evolution is guided largely by environment and his own initiative
It is scarcely to be taken for granted that the course of the worlds civilization shall be forward
There will be inevitable retrogression
Mankind will to all probabilities rie and fall change form and shape revert to degenerate savagery return again to civilized slate
Mankind is menaced with all forms of destruc tion including himself for Man is often Mans worst enemy
have drawn very conserva tive conception of the change wrought in Man after five million years for it is to Vie expected that he may assume an even more radical ap pearance than that suggested in the tale
Man long ago lost his tail and most of the hair which entirely covered his body
His appendix too is due to become passe
In time with the help of science he may come to sub sist entirely upon radiated energy this after having supplemented his digestive diet with more and more of the radiated energy until finally the digestive organs have become ex tinct
When Earth grows old
Man if he be sufficiently intelligent must find new world peculiarly adapted to him
It is most likely that during the rise and fall of humanity throughout the ages space flying will be re discovered and lost many times
There may even be visitors from beyond our own Solar Sstem
Mans occasional retrogressions to savagery and animalism will probably be swifter than his forward returns evolution following the line of least resistance
That he will become the food less and sleepless creature depicted in my story is but one of myriad possibilities for many things can happen to him in so long time
No one can with any certainty anticipate the farflung destiny of Man in the light of reason able consideration they may only conjecture
ATOMIC ADVENTURE ay CUMMINGS will always be fa mous for his stories of atomic explor ation Heres how the author of ELIXIR OF DOOM first conceived this theme Once was very earnest young bunessman
took subway ride
sat idly staring at the advertisements over the seats across from me
My attention focussed on an ad of the Quaker Oats Company
It showed the portly figure of Quaker gentleman in threecornered hat
He held in his hand box of oats on which was picture of the same gentleman holding similar package
And on that package could distinguish still smaller Quaker still holding another tiny package
stared spellbound
began to wonder if by going closer to the ad would see fourth smaller Quaker
And fifth
If had micro scope and the printing were mathematically perfect how many could see
An infinite numberl Quaker Oats down Into the infinity of smallness
went home seized pencil and paper
Thus my first atomic story The Girl in the Golden Atom was born
And it has served as in spiration for all my other science fiction
But was blissfully ignorant
In writing my first story violated every rule of plot con struction and handling
For instance called my hero the Very Young Man
When the story was in proof an irritated proofreader phoned me asking for name for the damned hero
him that didnt know except that he was the Very Young Man and would he please leave me alone because didnt want to be bothered

in Space
The Hot
mone Menace etc CHAPTER Worlds End HE earth was falling into the sun
There was no doubt about it
It was to be seen with ones own eyes
In the Western Hemisphere the people on the Atlantic coast saw swollen sun arise from the sea
Bloodred and distorted by uneven refraction it reared above the hori zon like giant eye of doom
It seemed to fishermen staring awe struck over the waters that this in credible sun that was four times larg er than usual hung for moment as though too heavy to rise
Or as though it were gathering strength for titanic effort to pursue its ageless course despite increased mass
There it hung for an instant
Then like cosmic bloated leech swelled by some nameless feast of celestial vampirism it shoved its ponderous unbelievable bulk above sea level
Bloodhued puffed like strained balloon insanely overgrown like malignant toadstool this monster sun loomed into the sky defiling its pure dainty blue
The fishermen had seen many and In the back of his mind each many sun swollen by refraction dur ing the dawn but never had they seen such huge orb spew from the eastern waves
And when the passage of an hour failed to reduce this awful phe Earth Faces Destruction and Only One person knew that the world was coming to an end nomenon and made it certain that it was to remain the fishermen franti cally hoisted sail
Their only thought was to flee from this ominous thing
Faces white beneath the saltspray tan they turned away and refused to look again at the hideous enlarged globe of fire
The leviathan sun flamed its way up into the heavens
It seemed to Man Dares to Match Wits with the Cosmos
THRILLING WONDER STORIES fuse the sky together so that it ran molten in streaks of ultramarine and glowing yellow
Beneath it the ocean seemed to lose its deep bluegreen and become crystal clear because of the piercing flood of rays from above
Then this stupendous sun as though Phaetondriven lifted itself ponderously for all the people of that part of the world to see and rising volume of fearful gasping cries seemed to swell upward from millions of throats
The sun
The sun was twice as wide as it should be
Its face was four times larger than nor mal
What in the name of all the gods was happening
The answer came to all to some in sidiously to others hammeringly to yet others explosively the sun is falling down on Earth
Or to the more scientificminded who were cor rect in little details Earth is falling into the sun
Einstein might have thought for an instant if any man could be so de tached in nature ah
chance to demonstrate the basic principle of relativity at one stroke to all the world
For whichever way you put it sun onto Earth or Earth into sun the end result was the same
Great catastrophes and holocausts of the past paled into utter insignifi cance beside this one
The great Chi cago fire the fouryear carnage of the World War even the legendary sink ing of Atlantis what were they com pared to this world doom
Stagger ing millions had been wiped out by the Black Plague of medieval times perhaps onethird of the existing population but here all all must die
There would be no younger genera tion to clean up and begin anew
This was that inconceivable thing death for all
The human mind no more than it can think upon its own personal death without an alarming unrest could not really grasp the thought of universal doom without going blank
Minds that did fully absorb the horrific thought those minds went mad
But in the majority of people temporary barrier of de lusionary amnesia kept them from realizing what it meant when their cracked lips spoke out the doom
One can imagine people walking around like shellshock victims muttering Everyone is going to die every one on Earth and then grinning foolishly at the absurdity
Yet in the back of his mind each person knew knew in such horribly positive way that all were going to die the whole world at once and as one
It ran like moan through the seared atmosphere Everyone is go ing to die Everyone is going to die
Everyone is going to die
Williams Bay Wisconsin group of scientists both profes sional and academic got together at eight oclock in the morning of that day of doom
Some had driven up from Chicago others had come by train and bus one had even flown up there to Yerkes Observatory instinc tively seeking out astronomical au thority
The answer must be here
Yet for all their hopes these men could not fail to notice that the air was tropically warm and the humidity almost insufferable
Even if Earth did stop its mad plunge sunward the in creased temperature would drive civ ilization toward the poles
At last murmur rose from the troubled crowd gathered at the towns small central park
huge car rolled up and several figures stepped out al most before it had come to stop
group of four made its way to the rostrum where on summer evenings the municipal band gave its concerts
The crowd quieted down as white haired portly Professor Hargreave second official of the Yerkes Observa tory nervously wiped his sweated face and confronted them
Gentlemen this is an honor Ridiculous words yet the crowd did not laugh or smile politely to it self
Momus himself god of laughter and merriment would have been pow erless to wring single chuckle from this grim dazed crowd
Professor Hargreave drew long breath and continued Well you all want to know what THE JUDGMENT SUN the official report on this this phe nomenon is murmur anxious assent came from the audience
Well it seems that is dammit all gentlemen we have no report
And dont know what you got me down here for in the first place
Did you expect that if we said the earth was not falling into the sun that the thing would promptly change back to nor mal
What do your own eyes tell you The crowd gasped and seemed to huddle together
About the only report could give you is something you all know any way
That the suns apparent diame ter is almost twice normal which means that it has approached within fifty million miles
It is too early yet to figure the rate at which Earth is moving he drev out the next word with an effort sunward but it must be at least at speed of one thousand miles per second
Unbelievable as it seems our planet is already as close to the sun as Mercury at its furthest aphelion
The lag in rising temperature which should result can be explained by our dense atmosphere which is acting as protective blanket
But when the atmosphere becomes saturated with heat He broke off as though the rest were too horrible and finished lame ly Vell thats all can say He turned away with gesture of dismissal
The crowd stirred but did not break up
It seemed reluctant to go away without some word of hope
But what word of hope could there be
ARGREAVE was about to step off the platform half angry at having been cajoled here to tell them that two plus two was four
Hardly anyone noticed the calmfaced tall young man who threaded his way to ward the rostrum and finally stepped on it
Just minute hundred pairs of eyes swung about in surprise stared at him curi ously
The young man raised his yoice as he went on Professor Hargreave and gentle men can tell you something about this phenomenon
can tell you for instance why Earth is falling into the sun You can tell us why Hargreave echoed and all the crovd echoed his words mentally
Yes The young man looked at them blandly
He seemed perfectly at ease
He paled little though as he sensed sudden murderous mood arising in the group
How did he dare to stand there calm and unafraid at time like this
His face became serious suddenly
can give you reason for this event he said earnestly
CHAPTER II Mans Fate SIMULTANEOUSLY thousands of miles away drama concern ing not millions of men but only two was being played in lonely isolation
The steaming furnace of the jungle had been around them for three days three sleepless grueling days
At last Cabel turned like an infuriated animal
His gross bearded face sweaty and haggardly lined vorked savagely
Damn you Robinson youre kill ing me he panted sucking in the hot miasmal air with straining lungs
No sleep for two nights just march march march
Im carrying both our packs and when want water you torture me with few drops
And these two bags of dust weigh ton
you cant wont go on The grin that came to young Burt Robinsons face was diabolic
tell you youre killing me screamed Cabel making desperate lunge
Burt sidestepped with short harsh laugh and pulled out pistol
It was Cabels own gun
Cabel growl ing slid to one knee
He made fu tile attempt to hunch the double pack off his aching tormented shoulders but Burts knots held as they had for three days
The younger man wiped his sweaty THRILLING WONDER STORIES hands on his shirt then took from his pocket folded piece of paper opened it up
In his clear script were the words confess to the murder of William Johnson with knife owned by Mayla our native guide and porter whom also murdered
Signed Ready to oblige rasped Burt waving the paper
Cabel looked up eyes like fevered coals between the matted hair hang ing down over his forehead
Never damn you
Im going to last this out Robinson see if dont
Ive had twenty years of jungle and its never beaten me yet
They dont come any tougher than me
Come on Cabel forced himself to rocking legs and staggered along the fern clogged trail
Burt put avay the pa per and followed
Immediately with their exertion the frightful heat clothed them in almost unendurable suffocation
Stabbing rays of the sun like mol ten bars of steel played constant tattoo on their clothing whichalready seemed on fire
Burt could not guess the temperature but he swore to him self it was the hottest day in history
But this torture of heat did not bother him as much as the fact that Cabel was bearing up miraculously load short water rations and all
Burt frowned
Before nightfall they would reach the river
If Cabel did not crack before then he might very well last it out
The row up the river would not be as much of grind as this jungle trek
Was Cabel to win out in this grim game
At camp three days before while Burt had been out hauling water from the spring Cabel had knifed Bill Johnson in the back and then had shot Mayla the Indian porter whose knife he had used
Burt Robinson had been saved by returning unex pectedly by way of the rock path sur prising Cabel and getting the drop on him
Burt had almost killed Cabel in rage seeing Johnsons agonized face
but he could not kill man even one like Cabel in cold blood
Thereupon he had decided to wring from him confession to insure his punishment by law up at Koniko
Cabel had sneered confidently
Then they had started on this journey into Inferno with Burt carrying the two guns and promising Cabel the worst fiveday hell he had ever imagined
Burt had no pity for the stumbling moaning man ahead of him
Pity for him
For three years he Cabel and Bill Johnson and faithful Mayla had worked their bonanza
Had sweated toiled laughed side by side
They had panned their dried well hidden creek bed for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in dust and small nuggets
Enough for all
hen Cabel greedridden had re vealed the cupidity he had held in check for those three years
He had planned the triple murder know ing story of attack by wild Indians backed by generous heap of dust would carry at Koniko
What incredible fortitude kept Cabel on his feet after this threeday eternity of hellfire
Even Burt un encumbered felt himself on the verge of sunstroke
And he was younger stronger than Cabel
The two men crossed an open patch of lushgrown ground and here the sun beat down with hammers of blind ing flame
Burt could not resist maddened urge to curse the fiery orb above
huge stinging drop of sweat touched one eyeball burning it so that he had to rub his eye clear but he looked again
And again raising his hand and peering through the fin gers
His lips made soundless ex clamation of amazement
Cabel was moving on doggedly head hanging
When they had crossed the clearing Burt called halt
Cabel threw himself pack and all on the sawgrass beside the trail panting like spent fox
His bloodshot eyes peered up mockingly from between the steaming tangle of his hair as Burt stood over him
Haul out our little paper sonny sneered Cabel so can spit at it THE JUDGMENT SUN He drew the flap of leather that was his tongue between his cracked lips Burt looked down at the murderer
Cabel he said sawing off the words you wont live to enjoy the fortune we made
Youre going to face your Maker with blood fresh on your hands Stow it croaked Cabel
You havent the spunk to kill me Cabel look at the sun The murderer peered upward to ward the sun
His first careless glance changed to wideeyed stare
An exclamation ripped from his heat lacerated lips
Good God
Whats the matter with the sun he gasped The heats got us it looks too big The heats going to get us you mean hissed Burt steamily
Cabel do you know what that means that we see
It means the Earth is falling into the sun
It must have been go ing on for hours maybe days but we didnt notice
Except that think youll agree this has been the hottest three days weve ever had even in this Devils sinkhole Cabels haggard face showed his abysmal fear
It cant be he mum bled swallowing with throat that had nothing to swallow
Maybe its mirage Whatever it is retorted Burt grimly thats going on between heaven and Earth Im not going to let up on you
Get going Burt driving the murderer along pitilessly saw at last chance to break him
Let his tortured mind la bor under the two burdens of secret murder and burning doom while the aching sweating physical grind tore his nerves to shreds
When the afternoon sun huge bloated orb reached its peak of hell ish intensity Cabel broke
Scream ing like madman he flung himself tremblingly under tree as if to hide from the pitiless sun
Its growing he babbled
saw it with my own eyes never heat like this before coming down on us Why did kill Johnson
Bbod he confession was signed
They went on with Burt carrying his own pack
Burt had given Cabel his fill of water
It was not till an hour later that Burt realized the murderer had cracked completely
He listened horrified as the broken man in front hissed Damn you sun you wont get me
Theyre going to hang me And Burt Robinson rowing grin ning vacanteyed Cabel up the river felt for the first time in full force the stunning realization of Earths doom
He had avenged the murder of his friend but to what avail
if you can believe me gentle men earnestly finished the young man in knickers
The crowd had not stirred since he first had begun to speak
Just who are you demanded Professor Hargreave
Well nobody confessed the young man with wry grin
That is my name isnt known except to my friends and relatives and the minister who baptized me
The name is Terry Blackwell
Im an amateur astrono mer use an eightinch refractor homemade mounting Thats neither here nor there Hargreaves puffy florid face was grim sweatbeaded
The thing is what proof have you for your ah quite harebrained explanation of this unprecedented phenomenon Proof Terry Blackwell frowned bit have proof of sorts
That is have series of photographs of the etherstrain in the past three months of its approach toward the sun Professor Hargreave looked at him sternly
And you didnt reveal this knowledge or theory at least of yours till this last fatal moment look of angry pain came into the young mans eyes
This morning at tried to get an audience at Yerkes he said slowly
was refused admittance
month ago wrote letter to Yerkes offering to show my photographs but the reply vas cold refusal signed by your self
It is not easy can assure you
THRILLING WONDER STORIES for an amateur to gain hearing The Yerkes astronomer flushed deeply
Hargreave remembered the letter vaguely and recalled too that he had chuckled over it
Strange how little things could turn up with the devastating force of hurricane in the sweep of tumultuous events
Well wel
see your photographs said Hargreave at last gruffly
Where are they At my home Geneva hours drive responded Terry
Perhaps wed better hurry Hurry yes agreed the astrono mer jerking himself up
Come my car CHAPTER III Stars in Their Courses YEAR before Robert McClaugh PhD had said believe my ten years of research are coming to head
Atomic power lies just ahead Six months before he had stated The power of the atom can be re leased by suitable concentration of cosmic rays One month before he had cried ex citedly Look Vogel my artificial cosmic rays already have the power to split the nitrogen atom week before he had spoken nerv ously Vogel dare not try it
Who knows but vhat the release of total energy in even thimbleful of gas might be the fuse to set the whole world aflame But what are you going to do Vogel had asked
Forget it for the time being Mc Claugh had muttered
Controlled atomic energy would be the worlds greatest blessing
But escaping it would be worlddestruction
Since dont know whether it is controllable with my ionized screen Ill have to work out sure method
There can be no halfcocked guesswork with this demonforce And McClaugh with Vogels assist ance had begun what might well be the task of years to find quencher that would as easily snuff atomic power as water puts out flame
Then something had occurred to put new face on the whole thing
Vogel had announced it with dazed expressionlessness
McClaugh had listened with detached curiosity
Come come man McClaugh scoffed at last
What are you trying to say that the earth is falling into the sun dont know how else Vogel said doggedly you can explain the sun being four times or more its usual size Why youre serious stated Mc Claugh
Then he dashed outside his laboratory home to see for himself
Everything was lit by an unnatural brightness this hot morning
People hurried here and there with fear on their faces
McClaugh put up his hand and squinted at the sun between his fingers
It was unmistakably larger sun than had ever shone on Earth in the history of man
What do you think sir Vogel asked when they went back inside
His lips trembled
He wiped perspi ration from his forehead
think its splendid retorted McClaugh vithout sarcasm
Vogel stared
But professor it means the doom of all Earth
Every one is going to die Exactly everyone is going to die The old scientist looked speculatively at his young assistant
Vogel do you think it would make much differ ence if everyone died few hours be forehand
Would you for instance care much if you died now or three days later if in both cases the deatn was inevitable Sir dont understand Fool barked McClaugh in quick temper
Naturally the quicker death is the more desirable
Death itself is not so terrifying the suspense of waiting for it is far worse
Isnt that so Yes sir
But we dont know for sure the earth will plunge all the way to the sun
It may stop somewhere and take up new orbit That we must find out Vogel
want you to call up all the newspaper offices and radio stations and ask for THE JUDGMENT SUN official reports if any His eyes held peculiar light
In the meantime He whirled on the motionless dazed Vogel
Well he roared
The young assistant ran like frightened rabbit
half hour later he sought the scientist and found him down in the basement workroom
Ive tried everywhere Vogel an nounced There have been no offi cial reports from anywhere
The newspaper offices have pleaded with Yerkes for statement but they re fuse as yet cCLAUGHS eyes still had peculiar glint in them
Do you know what that means Vogel
Their refusal to report means they fear the vorst
The earth is going to fall into the sun called my mother too mur mured Vogel biting his lip to hold back scream that pressed in his throat
She wants me to come home frightened guess
May go sir Yes of course of course The old scientists tone was preoccupied
He was busily engaged in examining the large electrical apparatus in the center of the room
Professor what did you mean while ago when you asked if would prefer er death now or later Nothing
Nothing at all hummed the aged scientist
He looked up fiercely as the assistant stood there
Well Vogel left with the echoes of that peremptory roar
As soon as the assistant left Mc Claugh ran to the door locked it
Then he gazed at the apparatus with eagerness
Here was the machine that could rend asunder mere puff of gas and extract from it untold power
But the proof of it lay in the trying and so far he had not dared try
He had not dared to increase the in tensity of his artificial cosmic ray beam to the point where it would not merely knock electrons loose from gas atoms but disrupt the nucfei themselves
In the nuclei lay the in conceivable hammer of atomic power
His cosmic rays were the hand that would wield that hammer
McClaughs heart began to pound madly an hour later when the appa ratus had been made quite ready
One twist of that red dial and Titan would leap from the machine
But would his screen of ionized mercury hold the vortex of potential force
Or would it burst free and McClaugh hesitated at the last min ute
His mind revolved again the train of thought that had brought him this far
Earth was doomed by an inexplicable fail toward the sun
If the vortex escaped and accom plished its progressive disintegration of the earth it would simply be quicker doom
But what if Earth was not doomed by the sun
McClaugh felt his mind whirling
The driving allconsuming urge of ten years of striving toward this goal gathered itself and rolled forward like juggernaut in his mind mowing down all other considera tions
Atomic power
Controlled atomic power or holocaust
The low powerful hum of the in ternal transformers seemed to beat time to his throbbing thoughts
Whitefaced dials seemed to stare at him like watching eyes
Watching this man who had fate in his hands
Power or destruction
Which would it be
McClaugh grasped the red dial with nervous hand
The die was cast
With savage finality he twist ed the rheostat control
He staggered back as tremendous shock rocked the floor
The whine of great power sang through the apparatus
Mc Claugh closed his eyes waiting for the microcosmic explosion that would destroy world
But the machine hummed steadily on
He ran to the dials face alight
They told their story the story of ten billion watts accumulated within the mercury chamber
And it had held
He had succeeded in produc ing controlled atomic power
The earth had legacy of endless costless power
THRILLING WONDER STORIES McClaugh grounded the mercury chamber dazed in his triumph and watched the dials show the slow out pouring of ten billion watts into the capacious bosom of Earth
IKHEN suddenly his face contorted JB horribly
His eyes swam in film of bloodtears
For in this moment of victory temporarily forgotten thought swept over him with crushing fury
Irony of ironies
He had given this great gift to world that would have no chance to use it
For the earth was plunging into the sun
Terry Blackwell shuffled through the pack of prints and finally picked out one
He handed it to Pro fessor Hargreave
Thats about the best took Terry said
It shows quite clearly the distortions of the star field es pecially around its edges Hargreave wiped rivulet of sweat from his cheek took the print eagerly
It showed small portion of the night sky with an appreciable dust ing of stars
Just below center was noticeable small patch in which the stars ran in curved streaks to form circle
Within that circle the star images were superimposed on one an other to form mottled design
The rest of these prints con tinued Terry show the three months progress of the etherstrain among the background of constellations as it slowly but surely approached the sun
did not know how close it was till one night it occulted Jupiter that is it threw Jupiters image about three minutes of arc out of place
Then knew it was comparatively close to Earth Hargreave and the officials with him looked over the prints carefully
One of the officials said finally Couldnt this be fault in the lens of your camera or in your telescope Strangely it was Hargreave who took Terrys part then
No because the distortion takes different posi tions in the print which could not be explained that way
Besides besides
seem to recall that several prints were ruined recently up at the Ob servatory by distortions exactly like these
We thought it was in the pho tographic paper and threw them away Thats right said one of the offi cials
remember that one print was ruined by fault in Scorpio about month ago June sixth to be exact confirmed Terry holding up the print for that date
If the group had had any seri ous doubts left they vanished utterl when this photograph showed the tail of Scorpio twisted out of place
Hargreave looked at Terry with something of deep respect
Young man he said excitedly think there isnt any doubt about it any more
In credible as it seems your etherstrain theory must be right
It plunged into the solar system or rather the solar system met up with it and as re sult They all knev the result great menacing sun that had apparently burst its linear bonds and become threat of doom over world of crea tures who were in the last analysis less bound by the laws of man than the laws of nature
Before blanket of censorship had muffed the blarings of radio commen tators an hour before there had been stark reports of rioting hundreds suicidal thousands hysterical millions in Europe which had already viewed the Brobdingnagian sun for twelve hours
What was happening in America the Lord only knew
THE JUDGMENT SUN Hargreave glanced at his watch
It was ten oclock
Wiping off the sweat sprinkled over his boiledlooking skin with limp and already saturated handkerchief he gasped Telephone
Quickly CHAPTER IV Sunrise UTWARDLY Jose Estaban was calm and proud with his back against the high stone wall of the prison courtyard
If there were any mental worms gnawing at his brain it did not show on his saturnine face with its mocking smile
He had been that way the night before during the hasty military trial
The solemn dark faces of the enemy had filled with hate as they turned to him
There had been the forma
recital of his many acts of espionage
Then the faces had turned to triumphant glee as the headofficer pronounced the sentence in cold harsh tones Jose Estaban known as El Disblo Espia your crimes against the nation of Bolivia merit death
Fucilado la solida del sol you will be shot at sunrise Jose Estaban looked up and saw the rosy fingers of approaching dawn tremble through the gloom
The ten men of the guard at an order from their captain made right turn on their heels and marched toward the farther wall against which lay ten rifles
Jose stared stolidly ahead
El capi tan stalked up
Blindfold senor He tendered black cloth
Jose smiled the saturnine smile that had won him the name of the Devil Spy
Save it mi Capitan he murmured softly for mourning when el Chaco Boreal the land for which we fight passes into the hands of Paraguay Brave words for dead man leered the captain
He whirled and valked to position beside the ten riflemen
As he glanced impatiently out the east gate for the soontorise sun his lieutenant spoke in his ear Would it not be best mi Capitan to have the men fire right now even though the sun has not yet risen lest he escape in some way The puerco will not escape Five times before was he captured and five times he escaped reminded the underofficer
He rolled his eyes superstitiously
They say the devil himself watches over this man
Look how he grins as he stands there as though he expects not to die but to have the laugh over us
The men are nervous too and Silence perro hissed the Boliv ian Captain
There is no miracle can save him
We will wait for punc tual sun to give the signal of his death But as the slow minutes passed in ominous silence with the flush of nearsunrise growing in strength even the toughsouled captain became nervous
The men fidgeted shuffled their feet
The lieutenant stood with mouth half open as if prepared at any mo ment to see the devil himself arrive and whisk his protege away
For el Diablo Espia had been almost myth for two years one whose activities had been devilishly cunning
In the gloom the spys eyes seemed to gleam like small fires
His lips were curled in mockery
Suddenly his eyes flicked to the eastgate and widened slightly
For there he saw girl white arms straining to tear down the solid bars of steel
At the same time the tip of the sun peeped over the horizon and shaft of brightness speared into the shadowy courtyard
El capitan awaiting this signal raised an arm
The riflemen brought up their guns took aim
scream in tercepted the word fucil The Bolivian captain glanced to ward the gate saw the girl and mo tioned for the men to lower their rifles
El capitan was of the old school with chivalry deeply imbedded in his nature
He strode toward the girl at the eastgate
Senorita beg of you to depart for the time
It is no pretty sight THRILLING WONDER STORIES this
Particularly for so charming girl ARK eyes aflame the girl spoke tremulously Mi Capitan please do not kill this man
Make him prisoner instead till the war is over Catamba
Are you mad
He is our nations worst enemy Then let me go to him die with him pleaded the girl wildly
love him sheltered him for many days before he was captured so am traitor to Bolivia
Do you hear
You must kill me with him because am traitor Diablo
That is impossible sen orita
will not believe it
More it is foolishness
You cannot die with him Then let me be with him for tiny moment
will do anything any thing if you will grant me that The stern look on the Bolivians face dissolved to reflection
You love this man si
You will do anything to be with him for moment si
You will perhaps let me do all in my power to comfort you afterward
Comprendo lovely one Soft black eyes tragic the girl nodded
Let me in to him and you will not regret it Grinning in satisfaction the cap tain called for one of his men to open the steel gate
But one minute will give you he admonished the girl
Like bird seeking its nest the girl ran to Jose enfolded him in trembling arms
The doomed man lifted up her face kissed her tenderly
In some after life we will be reunited Nina
Our love cannot die They clung to one another fiercely for moment then Jose pushed her away firmly
But go now
Death awaits me mi dies
Then with you die The girl flung herself about faced the firing squad with her body in front of his
At the other side of the courtyard the men watching this scene ex changed glances
The Devil Spys doom was being delayed as if death itself were reluctant to take him
flood of rays from the east gate now lit up the tableau with supernal brightness
The girls white clothes seemed to expand into blazing cloak that hid the man behind
El capitan cursed and started forward
When he had gone half way dark streak plunged toward the east gate
It was el Diablo Espia making run for the steel portal that had been care lessly left unlocked after the entrance of the girl
Shoot him kill him screamed the Bolivian captain frantically jerk ing out his own pistol
The distance vas hundred feet
Of the ten men tnat brought up their rifles one must surely have aimed true
But only one bullet was fired that of el capitan and it failed to stop the flying man even though it made trail of spattered blood over the grey cobblestones
The rest of the men stood staring toward the eastgate watched el Dia blo Espia escape from it
It was not him they watched however
It was the incredible thing beyond
heir widening dazed eyes be held the enormous bulk of an en chanted sun now hanging just over the horizon
It was the color of the droplets of blood that marked the es caped spys trail
Misshapen by re fraction it floated there like the Gar gantuan heart of some celestial Cy clops
Cloud wisps scurrying by made it seem to pulsate with nameless life
It was wizards trick and the Bo livian riflemen as they reeled back in fright had no doubt that it was the doing of the devil himself to insure the escape of his ward the Devil Spy
Professor Hargreave slammed down the receiver in disgust
Cant get Washington for love or money he said explosively
suppose every crank and fool in the country is on the wire
Talk about voice crying in the wilderness He jumped to his feet
But some thing has to be done
You Bradley take my car and get to Milwaukee as fast as you can
Get general mes THE JUDGMENT SUN sage over the radio if you have to buy out station
We cant let any thing stop us
Kincaid you take plane for Washington and get to somebody high up if you have to mur der to do it
In the meantime Ill try to get call on the phone through so one of the three of us ought to get our message across
Get going men The tvro men dashed out faces set in determination
Hargreave turned immediately to the telephone barking into it viciously
When long distance had completed his connection he rapped Dr
Morris Birge Director of Biology hurry Over his shoulder he said half mumblingly to Terry Hes government man
Agricul tural Bureau
Connections in what For moment he listened then hung up slowly
His eyes were pained as he turned to Terry
Suicide he muttered dazedly
An hour ago swallowed dose of curare
My friend
One night he con fided in me that his wild passionate youth weighed heavily on his mind
But for him to The astronomers eyes changed sud denly
He grabbed up the phone again hopefully
few minutes later he jumped to his feet with curse
Velter dead too he groaned
Shot this morning during jailbreak at Joliet prison
He was Gman hot on the trail of somebody down there
Now hes gone too
dont know who to try next for contact at the White House
But must have it Maybe can help cried Terry
He continued at Hargreaves gruff Well Wisconsins Senator Jordan has summer home here in Geneva
Just down the street
If hes home Come on shouted Hargreave pushing his twohundredpound bulk toward the door at an actual run
They went out into the hot afternoon
Since dawn the overgrown sun had increased its girth by another diam eter
It was now nine times as large in face area as normally
The heat teemed insufferable
Thats the house there pointed Terry and moment later they were panting up the steps of broad shaded verandah
Pray God hes here exclaimed Hargreave fervently
CHAPTER Cosmic Laughter HE God of Irony looked down on Earth that day and laughed
He saw world of creatures disturbed from their normal pursuit of life and it was funny to watch their painful antics
In New York drunk who had made his usual nightly rounds saw the dawn of an impossible sun and laughed himself to sleep on some bodys doorstep in the thought that pink elephants and snakes were passe
Near Chicago two gangsters re turning from ride with blood fresh on their hands stared amazedly su perstitiously at the bloodred Titan sun and ran headon into milk truck dying instantly
The God of Irony laughed louder
young man up all night in his shabby rentdue room bitterly con vinced that life was not worth living if one could not work and eat with drew the fatal blade from near his throat at the sound of outside shout ing that came with the dawn and when learning of the sundoom cursed the fate that was inevitably going to end his life while he was so young
After three days and nights of un selfish sleepless labor their rescue tunnel reached the cavein and they brought up the buried miner in the dawn of that fateful day and his tears of joy and relief changed into raging curse when he learned that he had escaped one doom only to be in time for another

By mad coincidence that fateful day had been one of the hottest of the year
The imagination of mans mind had swelled the temperature to unreasoning heights
Seeing is be lieving never before had that plati tude been demonstrated with more ir resistible force
Observatories in Asia vhich conti nent had first seen the phenonienon detail they had all failed in their mes sage to Earths unreasoning multi tudes
Not one of them had thought to give reason for the illusion
Terry Blackwells explanation owed its sudden universal acceptance to the fact that it accounted for the illusion as well as named it such
Terry Blackwell found himself world figure by midnight
Saved from further terror relieved of black heartchilling despair the population THRILLING WONDER STORIES demanded hero of worship for the soothing message of peace
He tried to escape it but at midnight found himself standing before microphone on worldwide hookup
What shall say
gulped Terry nervously
Professor Hargreave smiled indul gently
It doesnt matter much what you say
You could say boopboopa doop and they would take it for pearly wisdom
But you may as well give the world resume of your whole theory just about as you gave it up at Yerkes this morning But the theory is wild guesswork pleaded Terry
It happens to ac count for the illusion by luck per haps
Im not real scientist at all
If youre not real scientist Id like to meet one said Hargreave
He signaled to the commentator
The latter who had been frantically wav ing for them to approach the micro phone and had been filling the time with the usual playup sighed in re lief
People of Earth he concluded realizing the tremendousness of the occasion in that phrase People of Earth give you now Mr Terry Blackwell the young man who this day proved the great illusion ffW ADIES and gentlemen it was about three months ago Terry began that photographed Saturn with my eightinch refractor telescope
The print showed small faint distortion in one corner
The next night tried again and found an identical fault in the photograph
From then on with more luck than skill succeeded in trailing the almost unnoticeable distortion photo graphically as it moved across the stars
It was quite invisible by visual observation
followed it with pho tography for those three months and unmistakably it grew larger and more pronounced
One evening it cama abreast of Jupiter magnified it and threw it out of line as well as the immediate field of stars
That indicated that this giysterious enigma was close to us already between Earth and Jupiter
Not having the necessary mathe matical skill to plot its course had no idea it would eventually come be tween Earth and sun
But it did and in doing so caused the enlargement of the sun we have observed
About week ago started seri ously thinking of an explanation for it
What strange thing at least the size of the sun transparent but high ly refractive could be drifting through space
Since it was com pletely uncatalogued in modern sci ence had clear field in which to speculate
As result Ive worked out theory for it which later scien tific research may modify but it is this Somewhere and sometime in the cosmos dense and dark star like the companion of Sirius collided with an other large star and vas knocked out of its normal orbit in the universe or fused with it to become nova
This dead star must have been incredibly dense perhaps half composed of neu tronium which weighs sixty million tons to the cubic inch
And its gravi tational field must have been immeas ureably stronger than any we know
So strong in fact Terry drew long breath and con tinued for he knew that hundreds of astronomers and other scientists would be listening So strong in fact that the warp it produced in space became perma nent
Thus when the dead star itself was knocked away the etherstrain it had made went on in the old orbit
Like the shell of nut continuing to exist long after the kernel which grevy it has been eaten awav by worms
The collision itself may have hap pened untold trillions of years ago and perhaps in some other galaxy
But the etherstrain pursued its lone course unaffected by the laws that govern the rest of the universe and came finally to our galaxy and our Solar System
By deduction from its low ve locity it must have entered the Solar System within the orbit of Pluto about five years ago
But it would THE JUDGMENT SUN have been impossible to detect it then for even so bright an object as the sun looks merely like star from Plutos distance
And this etherstrain is ab solutely invisible
It was not detectable till it had approached quite near within one half billfbn miles and then only as faint smudge on sensitive photo graphic plate
So it may be said that the etherstrain sneaked up on us like an invisible snake
count it only as great good luck that happened to catch it on my plate since it only took up about one millionth of the total sky area
After entering the Solar System and because its velocity relative to the sun was just little more than Earths orbital velocity it contrived to hang in between Earth and sun for these many hours
Its huge area is very gradually drawing ahead of the Earth and will in few hours un doubtedly clear away
There is only one thing left to mention and explain the way it mag nified the suns image
The effect of such magnification will be under stood if it is compared to telescope lens with high refractive index but very long focus
Like giant hand glass this sphere of warped space hung between the direct rays of the sun and Earth and bent the light rays to focus for Earthly eyes
The etherstrain has the ability to bend light in accordance with Ein steins laws but in greater degree than ever observed before because its warp of space is greater than we have ever known
Paradoxically this warp does not have any gravitational influ ence as it should have for Einstein says the force of gravity is simply curvature of space
This can be ex plained by assuming that when space has been abnormally warped its gravi tational effects link into closed circle no longer able to exert exter nal influence
And so concluded Terry this extremely startling phenomenon in our skies today has been merely an optical illusion Hargreave had moment before he received paper from the announcer
He stepped before the microphone as Terry backed away

The MIDGE Thrice in the Annals of Man the Human Race is Faced with Extinction
INVINCIBLE By PAUL ERNST Microscopic Giants Dives Deep etc
Death Author or Links in the chain of humanity he sentinels of the tree people crouched in the highest branches of their communal dwelling place and stared fearfully toward the west
Beneath them the activities of the tree village were stilled
Men women and children crouched on quivering haunches each near tree bole up which quick ascent could be made if necessary
The strings of tough vines crudely fastened from tree to tree making sort of rough platform thirty feet above the teeming ground were empty
The hairy mighty thewed folk crouched and stared as the sentinels in the treetops above did toward the west
There where the whitehot sun was dying was the danger source
From there death came death on two colos sal hind legs towering as high as tree itself
When the hairy tree people built their aerial village thirty feet above the deathinfested ground they had hoped to know new safety
For while they had
The sabertoothed tiger the monstrous serpent the great THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE bear were baffled by that height
They could be beaten off by stone ax and club before they reached it
But this new menace which threat ened the very race made mockery of their sanctuary
In the highest branch of the conifer tree in the center of the aerial vil lage crouched Taljuck the Quick
Near him was the gorillalike form of Ank strongest man of the tribe Anks thick lips moved and gut tural chattering sounds were articu lated through his heavy protruding jaws
It was not language it was series of symbolic sounds painting simple pictures of the mind
You think the Great One will come on this sundeath Taljuck grunted
His jaws were not quite so bestial as those of the other hairy folk
His forehead was little higher
his eyes little clearer
His enormous hairy hands tightened on the odd contrivance he had made during the last four days
Who can say
Sometimes the Great One comes sometimes it does not
But when it does come it is al ways at this hour Anks muddy brutish eyes went to the queer invention in Taljucks hands
You are going to try that on the Great One Yes
If it comes ALUCK looked at the new weapon born of his brain
Fierce pride was in his eyes
It was tough curved length of wood nearly four inches through
From end to end of this was tiger tendon scraped as thick as his little finger
long straight stick with sharp stone was tied to one end
Taljuck placed the blunt end of the stick on the tendon stretched the heavier stick in great arc then re laxed it
The bow and arrow had been born of Taljucks brain though its birth was not to be credited for thousands of centuries and through it Taljucks tribe was to reign su preme for the lives of ten thousand succeeding generations
This cannot kill so great beast at once
But it can pass through the throat and later the thing will die You can send that stick through the Great Ones throat echoed Ank
Taljuck fingered the pointed stone at the end of the crude arrow
Eons later men were to find that and think it peculiarly shaped axhead not realizing the enormous muscles of the men that could use it as an arrow head
It will pierce the fhroat
know what it can do scream arose from below
It came from the downy lips of young girl Sor the FarSeeing
It comes
It comes
see the Great Ones head The tree people rushed here and there chattering like great apes
One child fell the hairy mother swung monkeylike to the ground caught up her offspring clambered to the heights again
To the heights that did not protect against so huge thing as the Great One
The sentinels biggest and strongest men of the tree folk grunted ex citedly to one another
All but Tal juck
Taljuck was silent bracing himself in the treefork with hairy legs while his great hands flexed and loosed the bow and arrow first of Mans great inventions
In the semicircle made by the white sun sinking over the horizon head appeared
It was reptilian head colossal its gaping jaws studded with huge teeth
short vast throat appeared then the rest of the body
The body was mountain of lizard flesh and bone carried on two incon ceivably enormous legs with great tail to help its blundering balance
It hitched over the ground crushing young trees making the steamy earth tremble
And as it neared the tree village it reared higher so that its incredible head was above the level of the hairy peoples sanctuary
The Great One they called it
Long long later it was to be named from its remains
Tyrannosaurus rex the most ferocious animal ever known
This was an anachronism perhaps the last of its kind on Earth freak sur THRILLING WONDER STORIES vivor species supposed to have died out miliions of years before the appearance of the hairy folk
But the tree people did not know that
All they knew was that sud denly moons ago this enormous thing had appeared over the skyline at sunset stalked to their village and taken five of their number as tall man might pluck five green gourds in high tree and gulp them down
Since then the Great One had come at irregular intervals and always four to seven of their number went down that tremendous maw
Bowing to the Great One and wor shiping it giving it sacrifices volun tarily had not placated it
The tribe was in danger of extinction unless Taljucks two sticks could somehow save it
To the highest branches scuttled the tree folk there to cling like furred fruit
But the highest branches were not high enough
The trees mighty of girth were not lofty
roaring whoosh of air was expelled from the Great Ones throat and its basilisk eyes fastened on Sor the FarSeeing
CREAM after scream ripped from her lips
Her face just becom ing downy with the fine hairs of adolescence was the color of lizards belly
The other tree folk chattered and moaned
Taljuck bent the great bow
The Great Ones jaws gaped as it lumbered toward the tree in which Sor clung paralyzed
Vine catwalks were swept away like thread by the monsters bulk
There was last shriek dry clashing of teeth Taljuck
Strike Ank grunted in anguish
In the hands of Taljuck the Quick the big bow quivered at its full arc
But the Great One was yards from his perch
He did not yet send the long stick with the sharp stone on it sing ing forth as he had learned to do in the days before
The tyrannosaurus as though drawn ay Taljucks appalled but steady eyes turned toward his tree
It lumbered there
Ank chattered and shriesed in ihe tree beside him
Strike But still with steady eyes Taljuck held the arrow taut on the tiger ten don
The Great One crashed within ten yards
Shrilling despairing cries Ank loosed his hold and fell plummetlike to earth risking death by the fall rather than face the monster longer
He moaned and grunted on the ground with both legs broken so tne bone pro truded through the hairy flesh which meant lingering instead of quick death
And Taljuck with grunt released his stonetipped stick
With thin shriek the arrow cleaved the air
The sharp stone hit the leatherarmored throat of the Great One and went on in
The arrow driven by force such as is unknown to any muscular framework of man today buried itself almost to its blunt end in the lizards flesh
The monster stopped its rush
Its short front legs went up and its claws raked at the thing that stuck out like splinter from its streaming neck
Then with an earsplitting scream of air from its cavernous body it came on toward Taljuck
Taljuck clung to his treefork as paralyzed as Sor had been
The Great One was not at all harmed by the arrow it seemed
Dimly its low ordered nervous system informed its tiny brain that it had been hurt but its vast strength was unimpaired
It got to Taljucks tree lunged against it reached for the hairy human midge with gaping jaws
Tai juck the Quick stared at the gaping maw which was streaming gouts of red from the transfixing arrow
The great bow dropped from his nerveless hands
From other high points the tree folk screamed and chattered and moaned
The branch on which Taljuck had been was empty
It quivered still with the force of clutching hands that had been torn from it and that was all
Taljuck the Quick first inventor was pulp in the toothstudded mouth
But what was this
The Great One though only two odi es had gone into its cavern THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE mouth was not crashing after more
It stood motionless beside the tree in which Taljuck had clung
Its ex pressionless eyes looked toward the west not toward extra victims
thundering bubbling airrush came from its transfixed throat
Blood and hairy fragments that it could not swallow geysered from its maw
It lurched slowly away from the aerial village
For long moment the hairy people watched it go unable to understand
Then the first timid shout of deliver ance keened out to grow to chatter ing grunting chorus
The Great One was being driven away
Taljucks stonetipped stick had beaten it
Three days later the tribe feasted on the mound of flesh that lay off to ward the west
Ordinarily no death of man was remembered for three days individually in the dim minds of these folk
But they remembered Taljucks because he had saved the tribe
They feasted in Taljucks name and the men of the village fashioned long sticks to bend like his and send stonetipped lances into the flesh of other animals
Taljuck the Quick was dead but the tribe lived on saved by the living fruit of his brain
rom their mountain observa tories all over the world the astronomers peered up the magnify ing channels of their threehundred and threehundredandfiftyinch tele scopes
In the teeming cities around them activities were stilled
Men women and children stood hushed in the streets and they stared as the astronomers did up into the sky
For every mans fearful eye and every mans appalled thoughts in the year were on the same object
The moon
From that heavenly ball hanging balloonlike now in the cloudless sky it seemed that the death of the human race was coming
For the moon was dying and in its extinction it promised to upheave Earth so that no tiny human mite perhaps no life at all would be left on its surface
The human race had thought itself in position to live tranquil and un troubled existence on Earth forever
It had outlawed the horrible wars that had nearly decimated civilization sev eral centuries ago
It had solved the food problem producing sustenance for Earth billions with only few hours of work day for each indi vidual
It had prolonged the span of life to an average of hundred and ten years
Man was firmly enthroned he had thought
And for time this had been true
But now this cataclysmic menace from the heavens threatened the en tire human race
In the Mount Everest observatory
Professor Talmadge turned from the eyepiece of the telescope which was so powerful that it would have re vealed man walking on the moons surface had there been one there to walk
He stared at his assistant Tohiki
Its the end he said
The moon is falling toward Earth at rapidly accelerating rate Tohiki nodded dark slanting eyes shining with sad intelligence Even if it fell no further he said it would be the eventual end Both were silent thinking of the catastrophes that had begun at once with the moons inexplicable subsi dence back toward the planet from which it had been torn million mil lion years ago
All over the world earthquakes of unbelievable violence had destroyed cities drained great lakes created new ones changing Earths map at the incidental cost of millions of lives
All over the world volcanic erup tions had burst forth on terrifying scale
Active volcanoes had belched more molten rock in year than in all their recorded history before
Old volcanoes became alive again
New ones formed in the most unlikely places one ten miles across its jagged new crater spouted through ancient rock in the Alleghanies THRILLING WONDER STORIES obliterating all human life as far north as New York and as far south as Washington
But the worst of the disasters were the floods ever increasing in height and severity
At each high tide the water of the seven seas rolled to new heights pulled by the increasing drag of the moon
Daily tidal waves mounted with their roaring crests loftier than they had been the day before
coastal cities of any nation were in existence any longer few twisted metal stubs showed where tall buildings had been
few weed wracked lines of broken stone indi cated streets when they could be seen at all under lowtide depths
All human beings save those millions who had been engulfed by the encroaching sea had long since fled to the inland mountains
And still the moon comes closer murmured the Japanese
Still it comes closer nodded Tal madge
And it will continue to ap proach
It will reach the point where the ocean tides rage over the whole face of the Earth daily
They will submerge all land even this great crest
Nothing but marine life will endure
In fact even that may perish for at this point the moon will prob ably burst and surround Earth with belt of million tiny moons that will blanket us from the sun so that our planet freezes Tohikis intelligent eyes went to small drawing hung on the observa tory wall
That may save us he said
Talmadge shrugged
There is perhaps one chance in ten that choice few of Earths people may survive the coming disasters in the Talmadge Retreat
If anything can save us that can The astronomer who was that rare scholar man of general accomplish ments in varied fields of science walked to the drawing and studied it with proud yet faultfinding eyes
Read in scale the drawing showed cavern ten miles across with rounded roof quarter of mile high which was supported by rows of en ormous metal pillars
The cavern was in the base of mountain indicated by dotted lines The outline of the dotted lines was that of Everest it self showing that the depicted cavern must be under the feet of the two men
Shall we call the elected few to night said Tohiki
Talmadge bit his lips
His eyes far seeing and keen narrowed
Then he nodded
We know what is to happen so shortly
There is no reason for delay
And Tohiki only two thousand people the best of every walk of life understand said Tohiki
Death was in his eyes as it was in the eyes of Talmadge
But the coming cata clysm was too great for anything but utter desperate calmness
Particular ly you want engineers that can handle the atomdisrupter Yes
That by all means replied Talmadge
Tohiki left the observation chamber
Talmadge went over in his mind for the thousandth time the one thing that made oarely possible the preser vation of human life on Earth
The Talmadge Retreat
No it vas not that
Anyone can excavate great cave at mountains base
It is another matter to feed and clothe two thou sand people in it and give them air to breathe over centuries of time
This Talmadge hoped to do with his atom disrupter
It was the last great invention of mankind one which by its very sim plicity had baffled science for cen turies
All matter is similar in that it is made from the same building blocks
One substance is made different from another only in that its atoms have varying numbers of protons and elec trons
It had been known for long time that if atoms could be disin tegrated to their component parts and the parts rearranged any desired element could be produced from the elemental debris
Furthermore any substance could be contrived synthet ically by controlled molecular ar rangement
THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE Starkly ferociously simple this fact
And with stark ferocious sim plicity Talmadge had solved the equation
He disrupted atoms with heat
But such heat
Three million de grees Centigrade produced for few millionths of second by electrical discharge through high tension vacuum tubes
It could not be kept up longer for fear of burning out the apparatus but those few millionths of second were enough to strip atoms
HE readdition of electrons to produce any given element
Ah that had been more difficult
But Tal madge had solved it in experiments no less sublime for being empirical he had discovered that different de grees of heat produced different ele ments and had the differences tabu lated
Thus by variation of few hundred thousand degrees he could take stripped atoms and give you what you liked from hydrogen to uranium
From then on it was mere matter of synthesis to produce anything from the air you breathed to the food you ate out of rock metallic ores or any thing else at hand
There were slight variations between the synthetic and the real products Talmadges oxygen for example had an atomic weight of instead of but these differences had no practical results
Thus with the socalled atom disrupter Talmadge proposed to keep two thousand human beings existing for indefinite centuries in cave under the base of Everest until such time as the planet returned to some thing like normality after the moons disruption once more allowing life on its surface
Talmadge sighed
He thought his mighty invention was perfected
If it was the human race had slight chance of survival
If it was not Soberly he looked around the ob servatory for the last time absently patted the magnesium rim of the tremendous telescope reflector plate
Then he went out into the sparkling cold air of Everests crest and stepped onto the slowspeed strip of the end less escalator which in its highspeed outer edge took him toward the mountains base at forty miles an hour
Within ten hours all were assem bled in the great cavern in the bowels of the mountain
There were men and women of the highest standing in all branches of science
There were men and women picked because of eugenic physical factors to keep up the body stamina of the race
There were few old men chosen for their exten sive learning but in the main it was young crowd
Talmadge knew well how necessary for blind race survival was sound physique
The cave in which these people were to live and their descendants after them for unimaginable cen turies was ready
In the center domed building rose that was the heart of the place
Dovn from that went shaft halfway to the core of the Earth
Up this shaft came Earths internal and eternal beat to be transmuted into plentiful power
Around the shafthead were the bank rows of atomdisrupters where all necessities of life were to be manufactured
Tinned food enough for thirty years was in stock before the two thousand would have to begin existing on synthetic food pellets
The entrance into the cavern was milelong tunnel from outer air at the base of Everest
This had been blocked up against the future mighty tides by solid seal of liquescent rock which hardened into substance like gneiss
Through the center of the milelong seal however had been left oneinch hole
Dovn this were lenses in sequence terminating in fisheye lens that spread vision
simple peephole arranged because the atmospheric disturbances caused by the moons approach made tele vision impossible
Talmadge addressed the shivering throng in the cavern
Comrades Earth as you know is about to pass into an epoch more violent than any it has suffered since THRILLING WONDER STORIES it cooled enough for life to begin
During this violence we and our descendants hope to exist in here through flood and fire through the moons bursting and blanketing of Earth through the ensuing glacial period
Mankinds nucleus may struggle up to reborn world from this cave thousand years from now million perhaps never
But mean while we shall keep the spark of the race alive hope That was all and even that was superfluous
All knew why they were here and what faced them
The calm of catastrophe beyond mortal imagina tion to visualize held them
Talmadge turned to the peephole
It was all very bewildering and in credible
There was no explanation for the suddenness with which it hap pened
All scientists had agreed that the mounting tides would rise gradu ally little higher each day until at last all Earth would be daily deluged
And all scientists were wrong
Talmadge inventor of the atom disrupter turned to that peephole to see for one thunderous instant thing which was impossible but which was nevertheless occurring
Instead of increasing in height gradually the moondragged tide had leaped within few hours to within half mile of what should be its eventual maximum
He had thought to see dry vista from the mountains base had thought it would be weeks before the high plateau would feel its first ripples from the distant ocean
Instead Tal madge looked through the rock seal to see something that at first he thought was great mountain chain newly formed about quarter of mile from the fisheye lens
Then he saw that the mountain chain was composed of water was the first really great tidal wave
sort of moan left his lips
Mile high in spite of the altitude to which it had already climbed to reach here the wall of water rushed toward Everest
Talmadges stunned eye saw great crests toppling from its highest ridge to be absorbed by the wall be fore they could cascade downward so great was that walls speed
He saw something like tiny slug for an in stant near the crest and realized it was whale
He saw white specks on the ground microscopic in comparison with the tidal wave swallowed in half second and realized that the lofty buildings of the new city of Ebberhow on Everests base had been destroyed as all things pertaining to humanity must have been destroyed along the tidal waves path
wave mile high
Coming with incalculable speed and force
Tal madge saw the solid wall rush seem ingly upon his own defenseless per son as it rushed for the far lens then saw nothing at all as the water struck the mountains base
Comrades he cried turning from the peephole
The cataclysm is upon us
The first great wave has struck His voice was lost in the trembling and rumbling of the mountain as all of mighty Everest quivered to the shock of that tremendous wall of water
But the people heard and Tohiki with despairing scream sprang to Talmadges side
He was not quick enough almadge ordinarily would have seen his danger as quickly as the agilewitted Tohiki
And God knows he knew enough of hydraulics to realize the incompressibility of water
But the magnitude of what he had seen stunned his brain and Tohiki was not quick enough
At one instant Talmadge stood with the back of his head next to the peep hole and at the next instant Tal madges head had disappeared
His body sank to the floor while over it from the peephole roared oneinch stream of steam and water as straight and solid as metal bar
The lenses pushed before the water column like glass bullets crashed to atoms against the opposite cavern wall ten miles away
The water column en dured for five hundred yards before it feathered to nothingness
It grew in diameter to an inch and half two inches three before the wave outside passed on and left glistening THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE drenched world to rear bared rocks to the air again
Then the two thousand in Tal madges Retreat with their horrible panic allayed went to the body of their leader
Talmadges head had been sheared off almost as though with knife as the lenses shrieked from the peephole
The flesh of his throat at the stub end was pulped almost to the con sistency of whipped cream by the high velocity of the projectiles
concerted moan came from the throng in the cave then shoulders were straightened with grim resolve and faces were turned resolutely toward one another
Outside was drowned and lifeless world one that would be so battered and drowned daily for thousands of years
Inside their leader Talmadge lay dead
But the protecting seal of his liques cent rock and the benificent products of his atomdisrupter lived on after him
The human race had chance at salvation because of the work of his clear mind
the late afternoon Talgor the Tall huddled into the protection of his vacuum suit and stared through the transparency of his oxygen hel met at the familiar landscape spread ing from the vacuumwalled tower beneath him
He looked absently at world as round and smooth as gigantic billiard ball world covered by thin topsoil on which grew patiently nothing but lichenous moss world lit dimly by darkred sun
Time was according to the ancient fables when the sun had been virile and warm and bright
Men did not have to walk abroad in vacuum suits to keep from freezing in the ever lasting cold
Many forms of vegeta tion and of animal life flourished
There had been mountains and val leys lakes and rivers and oceans
Then according to the dim legends great satellite whose name was lost in antiquity had fallen on Earth
It had raised tides that raged for un counted centuries
The tides had smoothed down mountains and filled up depressions
The satellite had broken up shielding Earth from the sun and water had frozen into solid and uniform shell over the worlds smooth face
The countless fragments whirling around Earth had gradually been pounded to dust by meteors am had vanished leaving the world again in the suns rays
But it was dying sun now with little of its original heat
But before the Great Change legend had it that handful of men and women had hidden from chaos in the bowels of Earth under lofty moun tain
They had literally eaten rock tearing down the atoms of whatever material was around them and re making them into lifes necessities
The handful had grown to hundreds of thousands and the small cave into which they had originally gone had become vast underground kingdom
Then they had emerged to the world as it now was to find that they were not the sole form of life still existing
Another form had evolved across tne world from their mountain form so alien and foreign so horrible Talgor looked guiltily around and then hastily pressed the little switch which shielded his thoughts from the Masters
Almost since the memory of present men there had been in the transparent oxygen helmets they were forced to wear in Earths thin atmos phere the familiar transmitter send ing thought vibrations to the head piece receivers of the Masters
It was only year ago that Talgor had devised the sensitizor screen which shielded his thoughts from the transmitter
Now he could keep his thoughts secret when they dwelt on Them though he was aware that death would be his lot if They found it out
He went on with his bleak thoughts
During the chaos caused by the fall of Earths nowforgotten satellite man had survived in his cave
Across the world coldblooded life which man had called fish had also survived
Most submarine life had been killed by the battering tidal waves just as air THRILLING WONDER STORIES breathing creatures had been killed
But few had found refuge in an underground ocean
one could guess how many mil lion years ago that had been
No one could theorize about the evolu tionary course that gradually fol lowed
All that could be said was that when Man came forth from his under ground empire the descendants of these coldblooded marine beings similarly emerged
They were still coldblooded able to freeze and thaw out again without harm
They still breathed oxygen from water their transparent helrrits contained water instead of air
But they walked on four paddlelike legs clothed their glistening and hairless bodies in vacuum suits and in their neverblinking lidless eyes shone in telligence
Much intelligence
They were bigger than Man in brain as well as bulk
Men had stagnated underground
They had kept alive the atomic knovledge compiled by the nameless hero whose inventive genius had kept the race alive but had added no new knowledge
The coldblooded waterbreathing creatures had kept expanding in brain power
They became the Masters with human beings as their slaves
Talgor smiled bitterly
Little enough use men were to the Masters
They were far ahead of men in thinking capacity their hardy physical points made them better fitted to survive in Earths present bleakness
Talgor had often thought that the Masters al lowed mankind to exist only because of Mans hands
Marvelous things hands
With them men and women the slaves could build machines more easily than could the Masters with their an noying flippers
They could more easily manufacture the water the Masters needed for their breathing for long ago all water lying normally on Earths surface had evaporated
But regardless of the purpose the Masters kept the race of mankind in bondage none the less horrible for the fact that the great majority of human beings were not versed in the ancient legends and did not know the comparative servitude they were in
But Talgor knew
He knew that men had once ruled Earth
He knew that men should be superior to these cold and emotionless beings calling themselves Masters
And he plotted for the return of Mans day
He stirred in his vacuum suit and stared over the towers rim
Below he saw several dozen small figures mov ing
They were friends secretly ap pointed to meet him here
He went down the towers core to meet them
score of figures moved to join him as he emerged at the towers base
They were white colorless in way inconceivable to mankind of far earlier day
Their hair was white their skins were white their eyes were white save for pale smudges of pupils
Absolutely without color
Talgor the Tall towered among them
He was nearly four feet in height almost as big as the average Master
You have your thought screens switched on he said swiftly and without preamble
All nodded soberly
They were mov ing on the edge of death meeting here conspiring against the Masters and all knew it poignantly
You are ready to risk your lives to the end that the world be cleared of the Masters and that human beings are supreme again Their white heads inclined second time
You know to the full the bondage in which you are held know said one voice sounding broken and hoarse through the dia phragm in his helmet
My woman was taken last year for thinking against the Masters
They took her helmet and vacuum suit from her and watched while she strangled and froze know said another
short time ago the Masters took my first child
had allowed the third bank of atomrearrangers under my care to slow for needed repair and they sought to punish me
They threw her little girl into the re arrangers
saw her disappear before THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE my eyes
Then They turned the heat control to degrees and ragged blob of codium appeared where my first child had been he others somberly added their tales of horror and oppression
The last concluded on desperate note one which Talgor however had sensed before
The Masters are about to get rid of us believe this man said
Time and again one or more of us has gone mad and revolted
Some of the Mas ters have been killed
Some of their machinery has been smashed
They have had several councils in which men are called unstable and possible menace
They are holding one now
believe that is their last council Talgor the Tall nodded vith des perate calm
believe you speak the truth
believe the race of man is lost unless weapon have been working on for nearly year can save it That is inquired the oldest among the rest
You shall see Talgor led the way into the en trance through the thick vacuum wails of the tower
It was an ordinary supply tower one of the smaller and more remote of the hundred towers which were the scattered heart of all life in which were the latest and finest atomic machines
They were substantially the same as the one which had gone with the handful of human beings into the cavern far in the dim past when the Earths satel lite fell and broke
The unknown hero of that time had come close to the ultimate with his atomdisrupter it was possible to make few improvements
Power was still obtained by borings toward Earths core borings that pierced to the very center now
The nearest available substance was thrown into the disrupters to emerge after varied heat treatments as the various substances of life just as had been done in the cavern
Talgor the Tall led the vay to the boring in this particular tower
Beside the twofootthick nozzle of pure ar drium hardest of all known alloys was squat bell of transparent sub stance within which could be seen numberless tubes topped by circular grid of some metal none of the men had ever seen before
This is the weapon with which hope to save mankind said Talgor his eyes sternly proud as he stared at the bell
Within this bell heat from the boring is converted to electrical energy which is in turn transformed back to radiant heat and stepped up in wave length almost to infinity by the tubes
The radiant heat is capable of passing through atmosphere and other transparent substances to ex pend its energy on whatever opaque body stops it up to range of about ten miles
There its force is dis sipated diminished by the square of the distance traveled
But think the range will be sufficient The others stared at him awed frightened hopeful But the Masters vacuum suits objected one at last
They may be capable of insulating their bodies against even your radiant heat Talgor smiled bleakly Their bodies may be shielded to some extent but not their heads
For they wear the transparent helmets just as we do and my radiant heat will pass through transparencies as it does through atmosphere diminished only by the square of the distance You are sure began one of the rest timidly
am sure of nothing said Talgor
have had no time to experiment properly
The Masters moved too quickly for that
My weapon may kill them it may not
That is the chance we take
Now you must go quickly
The Masters will be here soon The Masters
Here Yes
For the past few minutes have had my thought screen switched off so that they could read my mind and learn of the plot against them here
concealed only the manner of the weapon itself
Within few mo ments the Masters will be here all of them save the very young and the infirm darting to crush me before can menace their race THRILLING WONDER STORIES he other men milled around the tower with frightened cries
For generations fear of the Masters had been inbred in them
The knowledge that in body they were coming here now maddened them with fear
Leave the tower at once Talgors calm voice cracked out
Prepare to kill all survivors of the Masters race as soon as have struck
Prepare to lead mankind back to freedom The men streamed all too willingly toward the entrance
But one said You Talgor
What happens to you Leave the tower instantly before it is too late Talgor interrupted with break in his voice
What would happen to him
He knev only too well what would be his fate what must be the fate of any man within these walls when his radiant heat transmitter began to function
The others ran from the tower
From the soles of their metal boots appeared their gravity plates shield ing mass from Earths gravitational pull
They shot heavenward soared on stub wings slithering from the arms of their vacuum suits shot skyward again when altitude was lost in dis tance repeated the process sky hopping rapidly off to the east
And from the west The face of Talgor the Tall paled under his helmet
The sky to the west seemed to be darkening with great cloud
Only there had been no such thing as cloud in the sky for million years
This blackening was caused by the massed bodies of the Masters every one capable of movement was rushing to Talgors tower because of the frag mentary thoughtthreat he had per mitted them to receive
menace to their race
This one mad human midge must be crushed then more leisurely the rest of the slave race that had lately grown annoying
Talgor watched from the entrance
The up and down advance of the Masters like waves of great black sea rushed upon him
They towered up in last ascent before swooping
He could see individual bodies now monstrous cylindrical bodies witft four stubby limbs heads with taring lidless eyes glaring out through waterfilled helmets
He leaped to the control of his heat transmitter
His thin white fingers clutched it
One touch of that ardrium lever and if his calculations were correct the human race was saved
It was as tremendously sublimely simple as that
But he himself The thin air outside the tower whistled and shrieked with the cleav ing of thousands of stubby wings
Talgor the Tall pulled at the con trol For weeks along the equatorial belt where life was concentrated human beings under the leadership of the score who had been last to talk with Talgor destroyed remaining vestiges of the monstrous race that had en slaved Man for thousands of years
The old and the very young those who had been too distant to get to Talgors tower with the main body all the Masters Talgor had not anni hilated
Then with mankind once more enthroned on Earth they erected great statue to Talgor where the tower had once been
Had once been
There was scant trace of the struc ture now
When Talgor had pulled at the con trol the vacuum walls had blazed and melted allowing the radiant heat to smite full against the wheeling towering horde of Masters
The heat had charred their heads then ex ploded their helmets as the water within was turned to steam
Only blackened fragments strewed the burned earth for miles around all that was left of the last grave threat against humanitys existence
Well there was no tower left no trace of its banked machines
There was nothing left where the tower had stood save distorted transparent bell within which was fused metal
Talgor had given his life horribly when he pulled that control
Talgor was dead
But the human race lived on

bATFLiNE GUARANTEES IC jU StHICE FLIGHT OF THE CHAPTER The Empty Stratocar GAINST sky glorious with flung streamers of scarlet and purple New Yorks leaping towers and arching aerial streetways traced prismatic arabesque epitomiz ing the wonder and the beauty of the Twentyfirst Century
But Don At kins his lithe compact body poised on bigthewed legs widespread and firmly planted was as oblivious to that faroff glory as to the bustle of the Federal Skyport all about him
He stood beneath the high loom of the landing trap squinting into the west out of slitted eyes from whose corners weather wrinkles rayed threadlike and he was conscious of only two things
Under the yellow silk of his air mans tunic small hard lump was cold against his breast
It was the Uii ra Mod ern Sc ience oF ays to Come SILVER EAGLE OB lever that connected to Thomas helmet Ey ARTHUi LEO ZAGAT Author of The Lansotl Screen The Land Where Time Stood Still etc
talisman the Silver Eagle the throbbing pulse in his temples re minded him symbol of the gallant fellowship into whose fold he had been inducted at last
The secret that for months had lain prickling be tween him and his one close friend Bart Thomas was secret no longer
Bart himself darting from the dis tant Pacific would be here in minutes now to receive from him the twisting handgrip of the order
In minutes in seconds now siren howled across the field
black speck notched the low suns up per rim
On time to the dot At kins exclaimed
white blur in the air was suddenly silver teardrop shape caught in the highreaching fin gers of the landing traps gaunt gird ers thousand feet above him
The gigantic beam surged down pivoting on its huge hinge perilously fast at first then more and more slowly as Is Unieasiied When Two Powers Clash THRILLING WONDER STORIES its hydraulic shockabsorbers sapped the stratocars incredible momentum
Atkins dashed for the spot where the duraluminumskinned mancarry ing projectile would ground to end Thomas halfhour flight from Frisco Skyport
knot of browngarbed mechanics clotted around the tiny car
Their wrenches clanged against the bolt heads that had clamped tight the hatch cover against the airlessness of upper space
Twirling metal rasped against metal
The shining oval door swung back
With eager impatience Atkins shoved past the mechanics thrust head and shoulders into the aperture
Happy landing old sock he shouted
Welcome to The greeting froze on his Ups
The tiny cubicle was unoccupied was starkly staringly vacant
In the heat less light of the ceiling tube the tele view screen mirrored the Skyport tar mac glimmered from the glossy leather of the cushion on which Thomas should have lain outstretched
But Thomas wasnt there Atkins skin was tight prickling sheath for his body
The thing was grotesquely weirdly impossible
Im possible for his chum to have got out of the stratocar unless someone had unbolted the hatch from outside
Im possible for it to have landed some where so that that might have been done
To have arrived on the dot of its schedule the stratocar must never have relented from the uttermost limit of its speed
Time lost in any halt could not have been made up
Impossible for there to have been any halt the device was propelled by the blast of an electrostatic catapult at its starting point and had no power of its own
Once stopped it could not have taken up its flight again
And it had come straight as an arrow to the landingtraps hooks at which Frisco had aimed it
fleck of white on the cushion caught Atkins eye
He reached in snatched it up
It was bit of paper and on it Mr
Atkins peremptory voice battered at his giddy brain Conceal that and bring it to me at once The airman thrust the scrap into his pocket whirled
The groundmen were crowding in around him their swart countenances curious but it was evident that none of them had spoken
Then he recalled the tiny receiver clamped against the bone be hind his ear and he knew whence the summons had come
This device hasnt been perfected yet the grey man in the hidden room had said but within tne limits of the field can speak to you through it se cretly and at will There had been viewscreen before him too whose cosmicray eye could scan anything within fifty miles
Close it up Don Atkins snapped and say nothing to anybody Then he was running across the long level tarmac was dashing up the broad steps of Flight Headquarters Build ing was hurrying through the inter minable maze of corridors within
The chaos within his skull took on pattern as the amazing revelations of his initiation came back to him
The nation dreamed itself at peace with all the world
The Asafrican Alliance Americans fatuously thought having driven out the white races from the continents they had so long dominated wanted nothing but to be left alone
hey reckoned without the driv ing ambition of HungChen the new Genghis Khan who had forged an irresistible war machine behind the inscrutable mask of the East and awaited the auspicious moment to launch it against the Occident and the Americas
If he could not be stopped war rapine slaughter must inevitably destroy the Golden Age to which civilization had at last attained
But here was the wallpanel in guarded corridor whose curious quality he had been taught less than an hour before
Atkins halted glanced cautiously left and right
He was un observed
He bent to get his lips close against certain whorl in the blue tracings with which the marble was figured whispered password
whirring sound seeming to come FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE from the very stone itself told him that the impact of his voice had set in motion the soundlock within
The apparently solid marble slid open and the airman went through
The wall thudded shut behind him
In the windowless room he entered short gravefaced man mouselike in grey silk looked up from his desk
Let me see what you found he said without preamble
Atkins fumbled in his pocket with shaking fingers pushed the paper across the desk to the chief of the Silver Eagle
The red lines on it leered at him again the ominous de sign that had pronged him with knowl edge of the catastrophe that had over taken Thomas
deftly drawn dragon was coiled around the orb of Earth one taloned claw sprawling trium phantly to obliterate the double tri angles of the Americas
The chiefs grey face was almost expressionless as he touched the thing with fingertip but under his pale inscrutable eyes little muscles twitched uncontrollably
The token of HungChen he said
Like him to let us know that hes defeated our last device against his spies What does it mean Atkins groaned mental agony making him forget rank for the moment
What does it mean The others tones were very calm only the vaguest flatting betrayed the despair that must be closing in on him like pall
It means that the key to the gaps in the West Coast electrobarrage is in his hands the only thing he needed to enable him to strike
Thomas was bringing the plan to Army Head quarters and hes got Thomas But but you said that the Silver Eagle memorizes all its messages
You said that HungChens spies had tapped every means of secret commu nication weve had and thats why the Sliver Eagle was organized Correct
We thought that band of glorified couriers shot across the continent at speed greater than any yet known would circumvent him
But weve failed
This lets us know that we have failed
They will get it out of Thomas No Atkins fist pounded down on the desk
Bart will never tell
Hell die before he tells He wont die until they know
Theyll strip his brain The chief broke off
But that may take time
If we can find him before He ripped long tape from machine on his desk
straignt purple line traced on it wavered at single point
Look here
This deflection in the flightgraph shows that an extra amount of power was being absorbed between three minutes twelve seconds out of Frisco and seven minutes fortysix seconds after the start
noticed it and thought that the pro jectile had svierved slightly from its course was taking additional energy to straighten it out
But it occurs to me What sir Atkins demanded ex citedly
What That something may have come into the field there betveen three hundred and twenty and seven hun dred and seventy miles from the Pa cific on the great circle course
We might look that region over Im going sir Grey eyes stabbed keenly at the trembling airman
Youre new Atkins
dont know Bart Thomas is my friend
More than brother Very well the grey man made his decision
You may go
And God help you if you are caught
Listen CHAPTER II The KappaRay GREEN light from Traffic Con Xm trol flashed the all clear signal and Atkins thrust his throttle home
His gyrocopter leaped straight up from the fields shot up through the night past the successive glows of the level markers
The red of the lumbering freighterlane the yellow of the localflight zone the cerulean blue of the fivethousandfoot level in THRILLING WONDER STORIES which the great transoceanic liners plied cometlike they surged past in his viewscreen dropped below
Sunburst came to him from over the bulge of the rounding terrain as his ceptor staggered logily
Its roar ing vanes could no longer find any support in the near vacuum of the stratosphere
Atkins twisted the con trols
The liftingvanes collapsed into their slotted grooves
The flyer was sleek silver fish from whose tail the crimson flame of rocket gases fanned out
It darted westward silent and swift as bat out of hell
Atkins throttled down reluctant but obedient to the chiefs instruc tions
He must not overtake the sun darkness would be his best aid
Two red spots burned bright on his cheeks and secret fires flickered in his glow ing eyes
Im coming old man he muttered between his teeth
Im coming Bart
Stick to it
Dont give in
Dont tell them Endlessly blurred Earth streaked Underneath him endlessly the red po sition dot drifted with nerveshred ding slowness across the map framed at the flyers elbow
He shut off the feed unfolded once more the gyro vanes
He drifted down through the darkness silent as cloud in foggy night as invisible
rugged moun tainside forestcloaked swam up into dim view
Atkins checked the descent hov ered
twist of his wrist and the beam of his kapparay projector was searching the serried carpet of the trees
To the unaided eye that beam was utterly imperceptible but on the specially treated screen at wnich the airman peered avidly flickering disc cut through imaged foliage through dark underbrush
To the kapparay all organic matter is transparent only earth stone or metal can reflect it and become visible
Minutes dragged
Bare ground only bare ground netted by branch ing streamlets
Then what was that
Atkins held the ray steady quiver ing with bowstring tenseness
An irregular cube of stone showed misti ly
human habitation in the wilderness
His heart bumped crazily against his ribs
But wait minute it might be Ranger station depot of the men who patrolled this primeval forest that was preserved as national park
Beyond the house metal something huge curiously formed bulked vaguely
Atkins pulse leaped
He had found that which he sought
Thomas cap tors thought themselves well hidden beneath the leafy screen
Evidently the kapparay was one secret that had been successfully kept from them
Lover still Don Atkins dropped until he was bare hundred feet above the treetops
Too bad his search beam could not reveal human forms
He dared not send the map coordinates of this place by radio
He would be overheard the gang would be warned and escape
But at full power it would take him seven minutes to reach Frisco Skyport
Then hun dred pursuit rockets would leap into the air
In minutes the mountain could be surrounded by wellarmed men
He reached for the throttle
The sea of foliage almost black in the long evening shadows glowed suddenly into green flame
Just above the strange building an orange pin point leaped into existence
An in verted cone of radiance soared light ningswift from that focal point
In stantly the copter was bathed in the flare
Intolerable heat struck at At kins
The steel walls about him flamed cherryred
He was frying in the tor rid blast
Already his senses were leaving him with despairing instinct he thrust at the release lever of the emergency hatch beneath his seat no time to snatch at the parachute cone
He was falling falling TKINS lifted slowly back to con sciousness
His body was seared with pain
An iron band constricted his chest and his blood was salty warm on his lips
black silence enveloped him broken by vague rustlings and the sound of trickling water
His dazed eyes adjusted themselves FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE to the dimness and he saw twisted tree branches moonlight sifting through leaves all about him
He was lying across sturdy gnarled bough
Above him he could make out broken branches funneled path torn through thick interlacing foliage
Slowly it dawned on him what oc curred
Plunging down he had struck the lofty crown of some forest giant
The smaller branches the massed ver dure at the top of the tree had ab sorbed the force of his fall
This larger branch had caught and held him had kept him from crashing through to the ground
He had failed miserably
The reali zation wrenched groan from him
Suddenly he tensed clinging tightly to his bough listening acutely
voice sounded
Heavy bodies threshed through the underbrush
yellow glow flickered among the trees below and was gone
It came again held steady as it grew brighter
Two bulk ing shadows appeared forcing through the thick growth
The dim backthrow of lantern beat against the dull green of Rangers uniform familiar to Atkins from hunting and fishing expeditions in these very woods
This was luck
Their post could not be far off with its radiophone
Hed chance coded message to the chief
His throat tightened to cau tious call The lanternbearer stumbled ripped out an oath
It was not in English
His light found his face
High cheek bones thick lips narrow slanted eyes
They were Orientals
They were searching for something
Of course it was he for whom they were looking his body
They want ed to make sure of his death make sure that his crumpled form lying perhaps near trail would not betray their hiding place
The lantern glow flashed dartingly along the ground into the treetops
Atkins tried to make himself part of the limb
Rough bark rasped deep wound in his palm
He flinched uncontrollably lost his grip
He was slipping was falling desperate tightening of his gripping knees flexing of his aching arm muscles stopped the disastrous fall
But the leaves still rustled with his move ments
sharp challenge ripped the forest silence
tube in the yellow hand of one of the searchers spurted blue flame
It shot through the leaves and its heat the acrid smoke of seared greenery stung Atkins nostrils
second bolt came still nearer
Even if they missed him the light of those raytube flashes must reveal him to the hunters
Cut it out Mingai the other Asi atics voice rasped in English
Its nothing but wildcat or some othei animal do not think so
do not like that we have not found the body of the flyer Forget it
He was burned up in the ray The orange ray does not slay
It merely accelerates the electronic vi bration of metallic atoms until the melting point is reached
But for get you would not understand
You are as stupid about scientific matters as the Americans among whom you have been raised
You even speak their barbarous tongue better than the language of your ancestors You give me pain
Come on lets get back
Well tell FuKong to do his own dirty work fMTERY brave you are when he cannot hear you Mingai sneered
But in his presence you cringe and are meek like the rest of us
No friend LiSan we do not re turn as yet All right if youre going to be that way
Lets look further Not till discover what there is In this tree Hope died in Atkins brain
Going to keep on raying till were spotted by some snooping Ranger No there is better way Min gai turned back to the tree
His cyl inder again jetted its blue flame
It was continuous now was boring across the trunk
Back and forth the steady yellow hand drew the disinte grating beam
The great bole quiv THRILLING WONDER STORIES ered started to sway
Atkins got his feet beneath him on the perch leaped down
His aim was true
His heavy boots struck square on Mingais shoulder
He felt bone crack beneath the im pact of his weight
Even as the man dropped the American jumped side ward catlike his lithe form twisting in midair so that he faced the other Oriental
He caught fleeting glimpse of startled countenance then the saffron face was obliterated by the crashing thud of his fist
He whirled away hurtled into the shadowed brush
Thorned tendrils caught and tore at Atkins
root tripped him and he crashed headlong into tree trunk
He thudded to the ground lay there his tortured lungs laboring his outstretched hands plucking at the earthy loam
From behind Atkins heard thin whistle shrill almost above the range of human hearing
From far to his right another responding
Evidently the men from whom he had escaped were signalling for aid
He struggled erect
He was unarmed alone bruised and battered terribly fatigued
But he knew now that he could escape by working down the hill to his left
In the other direction were desperate men weapons at their ruthless com mand that could whiff him into eter nity at will
He turned to the right
CHAPTER III TJie Pursuit Squadron ON ATKINS crouched in the shelter of bush
Before him the stone structure he had seen from the air loomed blackly
Over the clearing rope network carried camouflage of tree branches that his kapparay had pierced
He could hear murmur of voices but the sounds came from beyond or within the squat building
On the side toward him there was silence and nothing moved
The darkness of the wall he faced was re lieved by horizontal line thread of light almost imperceptible
The Americans eyes clung to it
Then he was crawling across the bare ground that lay between
Twenty feet of shelterless surface flecked with the revealing light of the moon
Could he make it unobserved
Inch by crawling inch every muscle every nerve taut with expectation of sudden hail of blue flash that would sear him into nothingness At kins slid toward the beckoning line of light
After an eternity he was in the solid shadow of the wall
He raised himself cautiously and found the place where the light shone through
It was the lower edge of steelshuttered window just at the level of his eyes
He could not see much of the room within the aperture was mere slit
But what he saw was enough
Just within range of his vision was table top black and glistening like glass
Fastened to its surface leather straps cutting deep into the flesh of his arms and legs was Thomas
His friends stocky body was stark naked
In cold lurid light that beat down At kins could see his knotted muscles writhe snakelike the sweat of agony gleaming on his skin
Thomas face was deathly white his clenched teeth were revealed by lips that curved away his eyes were closed and his cheek muscles were quivering
His forehead his hair were covered by metal helmet from which wires curled away out of sight
low mechanical hum rose steadi ly in pitch
Bart Thomas form arched slowly up from the table straining against its creaking bonds
Suddenly the hum stopped and the twisted body slumped flaccidly inertly down
yellow hand slim its long fingers ending in pointed nails came into view holding small sponge to Thomas nostrils
The prisoner quiv ered his eyes opened and Atkins fists clenched as he read the despair that stared from them
He heard voice suavely cruel
It is very painful this searching of your brain
If you chose to talk you would save yourself much anguish Atkins scalp was tight cap for his skull as the bound mans eyelids FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE dropped and lifted again
Even speech seemed too great an effort for him but his lips moved
hand was clamped over Atkins mouth power ful arm wound around him from be hind pinning his own arms to his sides
He was lifted from the ground
He drove desperate heel backward into hard shin
Something crashed against the back of his head and he hung dazed and barely conscious in huge arms that carried his hundred and fifty pounds as though he were child
The room whirled dizzily about Don Atkins
He saw men television screen black tube that rose through the ceiling from some unknown de vice
He was carried through another door and saffronhued face length ened by wisp of grey beard and drooping mustachios under hawk nose drifted hazily before him
Only the eyes were clear black eyes pierc ing behind their slanted lids
Atkins was set down in chair
Hands fumbled at him passed rope around him binding him to his seat
He scarcely noted it spellbound by those glittering eyes
His fogged brain cleared bit and he saw tall Oriental imperturbable
There were banked tubes glowing behind him and bright copper coils
To one side table its black top glistening like glass
Thomas strapped down was looking at him with eyes in which in credulity and horror flared
The tall Oriental spoke
Who is this NaGarri rom behind Don huge black came in view
Dressed like the others of the gang in the olivegreen of the Rangers he was still redolent of the jungle
His skin was deep dull black that swallowed light
His bullet head sat queerly on wide shoul ders from which arms thick as sap lings hung loosely almost to his knees
His voice was throaty rumble
dont know
Lord FuKong
But the electriceye alarm he flash and find this one peeking in
So bring him to you
Maybe he the one who we bring down from the plane the one who jump on Mingai and LiSan The other nodded
He seems very persis tent To Atkins You display great deal of interest in our proceed ings
hope you are satisfied with your present opportunity to observe them He reached out clawlike hand and ripped away the front of the airmans shirt
He snatched at the token hang ing there
The fine gold chain snapped and he had it in his hand
faint smile crossed the jaundiced mask of his face and he held the tiny bird out to the black
Not half inch long it was but exquisitely wrought
An eagle poised as if in flight it seemed almost alive
See NaGarri this is another of the brood
They wear talismen about their necks like your own tribesmen to bring them good luck
But fear the Dragon of HungChen is too strong for their puny godlet He turned back to the American
shall deal with you in moment when have finished vith your comrade
Watch closely American and wish you joy of what you see Now he was talking to Thomas and his voice was crawling threat
Have you decided to answer my questions No Thomas voice was tor tured whisper but his lips closed tight and firm
Fear and despair drew haggard lines across his face
FuKong shrugged stepped to the wall where tall slate panel glit tered with switchpoints gages gleaming ebony wheels
Still stubborn
You will not be lieve me then that this searcher will delve deeper and deeper into the core of your brain till it wrenches the ut termost secrets of your ego from you
Yet it was an American who first proved that thought is an electric process who first measured the tiny currents that flow along the nerves
Well if you must have it His fin gers closed on lever just above bind ing posts to which the wires trailing from the helmet on Thomas head trailed
Now FuKong
FuKong shrill cry from the outer rooiti stopped him
THRILLING WONDER STORIES Another plane has appeared above Atkins forced his head around
Min gai was in the doorway his shoulder bandaged his right arm in sling
Well why burst in on me like this FuKong was imperturbable
Send someone to dispose of the re mains The others face was sickly green
But it got away he gasped
It got away The phrase was like the purr of an enraged cat
My broken arm had to use my left missed with the orange ray and before could aim again he was out of range Mingais voice trailed away in an apologetic murmur
You the other began fury breaking through the stony mask of his face
But again there was an in terruption
sallow Hindu appeared
Master the plane that escaped is signalling to Frisco Skyport and their rocket squadron is taking off The chief had not failed them
He had sent following plane that by great good luck had escaped the Asi atics lethal ray
Atkins calculated hastily
In ten minutes now this nest would be surrounded the spies cap tured Thomas freed and his secret safe
UT FnKong was snapping per emptory orders
Mingai and the Hindu had disappeared NaGarri was unstrapping Thomas was carry ing him out
The Oriental leader him self raytube in hand was unfasten ing the rope that bound Atkins
Get up and precede me The spy gestured with his weapon
The American obeyed staggering on limbs that were needling with returning blood
He was through the outer room his captor close behind him was in the open
ahead loomed monstrous metal shape
Egg shaped it was save for one end that was sliced off sharply and there was an opening manhigh in its side
Na Garri was just vanishing within with his burden
Atkins followed
Fu Kong clanged shut the slide behind him
steel ladder mounted through dim green light curving over an in ner shell
Atkins head came through trapdoor above and he was in low long chamber
Then he was once more tightly bound
rough shove from the black sent him sliding across the floor to thud against Thomas trussed and naked form
LiSan was just closing the trap door
Mingai fear in his eyes was thrusting up on valvehandle that projected from large vertical pipe in the wall
At the far end before large viewscreen the Hindu was seated black discs of phone receivers clamped to his ears
Beside him Fu Kong bent over serried row of gages and levers atop metal console
large viewscreen before him showed the forestbordered clearing and the stone building that had been vacated in such haste
FuKong pushed at lever and the viewscreen was flare of flame
It cleared
Where the house had been was gaping hole in the ground
Orientals hand moved again
The screen was downrushing blur
It cleared once more
Velvetblack star strewn the night sky was about them and the farbelow forest was dark mysterious sea
Don old man the whispering voice in his ear was Thomas how on earth did you ever get into this mess came to find you Atkins said grimly
And did
How are you Pretty rocky
But Ill keep until FuKong gets chance to work on me again cant understand how he ever got hold of you
Your carrier came in right to the dot
What happened was zipping along watching the shoot past in the screen when suddenly something flashed over me and dropped down in front Shot over you
thought the rocketstratocars were the fastest things ever produced So did until saw this craft
Ill bet it can make three hundred miles minute
It passed me as if were standing still
At any rate there it was right ahead of me and slowing
The blunt end was toward me and thought sure was going FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE to crash into it
No way to swerve those carriers you know
But just as reached it hole opened and sailed right inside Good Lord
Then its sort of flying trap
Damned in genious eh
can figure out the rest of it now
You say the stratocar reached New York on time
That means they closed the stern and speeded up again till they were mak ing just the rate was
Afterward they went faster once more got clear of my boat and dropped away
They had just picked me out of it on the fly
LL knew at the time was that my hatch opened and the big black was pointing raygun at me
He told me to get out and got
VVe were in an airlock and there was rope ladder hanging down
climbed it and found myself in this room
Fu Kong was here and the Hindu
Then in little while we were down in the clearing where the others were wait ing
After that my troubles really began Look at the screen be said sharply
Atkins twisted himself back to his original position
In the distance score of scarlet lights made dancing crescent on the viewscreen
They rose and fell but came on steadily
He thrilled at the sight
These were the army flyers from Frisco Skyport
No mistaking that formation
Those farspreading wings would sweep around as the center checked and the Asafrican craft would be caught in an enfilading fire
FuKong and his gang were doomed
Peculiar how calmly they were taking it
East ern fatalism he supposed
Eastern fatalism hell
Memory fanged him
Thomas had just told of the incredible speed at FuKongs command
The spy master was not trapped far from it
He could get away at will
Why was he hanging here motionless watching those on coming flyers sardonic smile ting ing his yellow face
Nearer and nearer the lights came
The dim shapes of the army rocket planes showed phantomlike
The cen tral ship dipped minutely and the long line began to expand
The mot ley crew of the spy ship clustered be hind their leader in the bow
Near enough FuKongs voice rang like sentence of doom
long pencil of orange light shot out from his vessel wavered impinged on the nearest plane
The flyer flared red then dazzling white at the tip of the beam
Then there was nothing there
The death ray moved on to the next in line
All along that farflung line cor uscation of green swept as the in domitable fighters shot out their fu tile answer
Lethal enough those rays but their range was far short
Another plane was caught in the orange beam and vanished
But the squadron came on their mile long firetails lashing them through the night
If one only one could get near enough to spear the Asafrican craft with its beam
Taking that one des perate chance the birdmen rushed into the face of destruction never falter ing never wavering as ship by ship the orange scythe reaped its deadl harvest
Only ten ships were left of the score that had first appeared only nine and still the green rays were miles short of their mark
Minutes passed that were long as eternity
Eight of the intrepid at tackers remained then seven
But now the stabbing darts of emerald death were almost reaching their mark
little more only little more
Suddenly the floor vibrated and Atkins heard the muted thunder of the crafts rocket blasts
The spy ship was moving at last
FuKong would escape that vas unavoidable
The terrific speed of his strange vessel could never be matched by the combination planeandrocket craft of the Americans
But at least the pitiful handful remaining would escape the holocaust
Seeing the fu tility of their courageous attempt they would return to their base perhaps eifectuate plans for countrywide en circling movement that might in the long run bring the yellow ship dovn
No Atkins mouth twisted in THRILLING WONDER STORIES Boundless oath the Oriental had no intention of permitting that
The distance between the spycraft and the nearest attacker did not in crease
The Asiatic was keeping just beyond the range of the green rays was taking toll on the American avia tors with false hope while the merci less orange beam flared out mowing the velvet night with destruction
CHAPTER IV The Dragon of HungCben UT of the twenty flyers who had soared to the attack bare SiX still charged on
They were insane
They couldnt win But couldnt they
Atkins stifled gasp was taut with sudden hope
Five of the squadrons remnant had startlingly changed their tactics
They were zigzagging were darting left and right up and down in what seemed last panicky attempt to evade the Asiatics ray
Senseless it seemed but there was one ship that had left the group
Its green ray was doused only the pin point red of its tailflame betrayed its course to Atkins
He flung out his soul in wordless prayer that neither FuKong nor his aides would notice that stealthy climb
Steadily the squadron leader mount ed till the scarlet dot that marked him out was touching the upper margin of the viewscreen
Ten thousand feet below his comrades flitted about in their macabre dance cheating the orange death again and again by breathless inches
The attention of the enemy crew was concentrated on those darting shapes on their darting ineffective rays
Atkins eyes flicked back to the lone flyer
He saw the sudden crimson burst saw the dovmward curve of its flaring wake as terrific swoop began saw the green ray dart out ahead spearhead of the diving hawk
Down and down and down adding the pull of Earth to his own driving blasts the avenger plunged in one last magnifi cent effort to catch the destroyer un aware zipping faster and faster until even in that tenuous air the steel planebody glowed dull red with the friction of its unleashed speed
minutes grace sixty unobserved seconds of that lightning slant and it would snip the yellow menace from the skies
Look FuKong look It was Mingai who yelped the alarm
The orange ray swept up
Jammed By luck by the luck with which the gods award the greatly daring the downdarting American had found the one vulnerable angle of the spy ship
Green flame licked out hungri ly but FuKongs hand was light quick in its flash to the throttle lever
His ship lurched jerked aside in the last possible moment of safety
The American was under now right under the spycraft
But the dragon ship was driving ahead
In an eyeblink FuKong would be able to bring his death ray to bear on the daring flyer
Don Atkins flung heavi ly across the floor by the sudden jerk saw not quite three feet above him gleaming copper handle the valve at which Mingai had twisted just before the takeoff
Legs lashed arms bound sweat pouring from his lined brow eyes bulging from their sockets by sheer power of stomach and trunk muscles alone he swung his torso from the floor
His head came level with that handle
His teeth clamped around it
Corded sinews stood out on his neck as he drove the valve lever down
Sud denly he was snatched loose by lurch of the craft and his preposterously twisted body crashed down
But that very lurch told him of suc cess
It was the main fuelvalve
He had cut off the rockettubes supply
In an instant now the vessel would be caught in the raybeam of the pi lot below
Atkins tensed to meet the green flash that would mean oblivion for FuKong and his myrmidons and for Bart Thomas and himself
It never came
shrill high pitched oath footsteps running to ward him pulled open his eyes
Fu Kong was bending over him face livid with wrath raygun rising for the FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE eoup de grace
Behind him LiSan came up strange glow between his slant lids
Atkins eyes flicked past the couple
In this final moment life he must know what had happened why his intended sacrifice had failed
BLUE electric veil shimmering and sparking in cerulean net work of tiny lightnings curved ail across the viewscreen
Beyond it the misty shapes of the attacking aircraft spat their green beams
The emerald death rays spattered harmlessly on the ionic curtain and were quenched
From within the orange ray thrust futilely against the hollow defensive sphere of force
This Atkins saw in single flash ing glance
Then he was staring up at the enraged Oriental was waiting in timeless void for the blue spurt that would sear thought and con sciousness and life itself from his de spairing brain
Wait Master LiSan snatched at FuKongs hand swerved it aside from its aim
That way is too easy for the paleskinned dog
Let me and Mingai take care of him
Ve have debt to pay for vhat he did to us in the wood In the others slitted eyes glint of satisfaction showed
had my doubts of you LiSan
Twice you have shown deplorable softness in your tasks
This like much better
You may have your wish
But take him below have much to do and do not wish to be dis turbed Atkins skin crawled
Death he could face calmly but that which the fanatic gleam in LiSans saffron mask promised made him coward
FuKong he croaked barely able to force the words through his con stricted throat
Dont give me to him
Kill me yourself
That would be clean and honest But the Ori ental was walking away
They took him down through the trapdoor carried him down flung him heavily on the plates in the narrow space between the entrance hatch and the curving inner shell
Untie him Mingai There was an undercurrent of eager excitement in LiSans tones
Even in the face of what was to come Atkins wondered at the gratuitous cruelty of the Ori ental mind
Mingai stooped to him fumbled at his lashings
As they fell away the American leaped up to make fight of it
Hopeless of course Li San had his raygun poised for action
Better to go out that way than to suf fer the planned revenge of the sadis tic duo
Now Hands up Mingai
Quick The virulent threat in LiSans voice made the low command seem crashing shout
Mingai straightened
His arms flew above saffron face from which amazement and horror had stripped its habitual mask
LiSan was braced on spread feet his raygun thrust before him
His countenance was alight with strange flame and his eyes snapped menace
One whimper from you and flash There was an instant of stunned silence
Then LiSan spoke again
Here you American
Grab those ropes
Tie him up and gag him
Quick man Dazed by the sudden turn Atkins obeyed
VVhat lay behind this sudden act on the Asiatics part
Had he suf fered sudden change of heart He recalled in the wood LiSan trying to argue Mingai out of his determina tion to search the tree in which he was hiding
He recalled LiSans inter THRILLING WONDER STORIES vention with FuKong moment ago that had certainly saved his life His task was finished Mingai tightly bound and strip from his own tunic jammed none too gently into his mouth
Before Atkins could oice his questions there was sud den dull roar which shook the vessel
Hes getting under way again Li San barked
Weve no time to lose He plucked Mingais raygun from his belt thrust it into the Americans hand
Come on He was flitting silently up the ladder Atkins per force after him
hey were just beneath the rivet studded trap
LiSan lifted the lid slowly till narrow crack of brighter light showed along its edge
Atkins managed to crush in alongside of him on the narrow step and to gether they peered through the slit
The blue defensive sphere was gone and the attacking ships had vanished
But something else showed in the sky long slim torpedolike object that sped straight for the spy ship
From its nose white light flickered in rapid series of dots and dashes
Atkins felt an electric quiver of tense ness run through the yellow man against whose body his own was crushed
strange pattern formed itself in the Americans mind as he crouched there waiting for he know not what
That oncoming shape had the very form of the rocketstratocars used by the Silver Eagle
Yet this was no messenger waylaid as Thomas had been
He had signalled to FuKong
Why had the spycraft waited here chancing the fight with the American planes when it might have been away and gone with only the slightest ef fort
What was it that glowed from LiSans eyes that shook him with an ague of eagerness
Nearer came the speeding rocket and nearer still until it passed out of sight at the lower edge of the view screen
The larger craft lurched and lurched again
FuKong thrust at his levers there was hiss of rushing air
Then buzzer shrilled
Hes picking up the stratocar Li San whispered
Get ready All right NaGarri FuKong called
The air in the entrance lock is at normal pressure
Open up The black bent to ring in the cen ter of the floor and pulled on it
round manhole lid came away
head appeared and squat broad body followed it
Straight black hair tiny black eyes almost hidden by high cheekbones broad flat nose over thick red lips this was Tatar face throwback to the Mongol hordes that in the Thir teenth Century ruled half the then known world by force of arms
From that stocky figure emanated an aura of power of dominance
Unbounded ambition lust for power savage cruelty were stamped on the round flaccid countenance
LiSan clutched Atkins arm his fingers sinking into the flesh
Its HungChen
Come himself to receive FuKongs reports
To morrow the attack Atkins under stood why the spymaster had been un able to flee
He had had to wait here for his chief no way to change the course of the stratocar once it had started
The huge black bowed low
The Hindu joined him in humble obeis ance
The haughty FuKong came away from his controls abject ser vility in every line of his tall body
The Mongol spoke sharply and there was rapid exchange in shrill high piping tongue
Now The snapped word from Li San galvanized Atkins into action
He thrust upon the hatch leaped
The yellow men swung to the sound of the falling trapdoor saw tvo apparitions spring into view ray guns at the ready
Throw up your hands
Up viith them Atkins shout drove through the chamber
Up or we wipe you out LiSans eyes were blazing pits of wrath
NaGarris simian arms went ceilingward the Hindus
Hung Chens
FuKong ripped out viru lent Traitor at LiSan and snatched at the cylinder in his belt
Sssss Blue lightning hissed from Atkins weapon
blackened FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE corpse crumpled slowly to the floor Any more His voice was thick with fury
But the remaining three stood statuelike
We surrender came the voice of the captured over lord
Dont flash heir captives tightly bound the two Don Atkins the American and LiSan the Chinese turned to one another
Atkins hand went out to the other then hesitated drew back
LiSan straightened
No he answered the question in the Americans eyes am not trai tor to my own people
Here his hand tapped his own breast there are two loyalties one to the race among whom was born among whom have lived my life and have my friends the other to the race of my ancestors
War between them vas unthinkable to me He glanced down at Hung Chen bound and glowering looked up again wdstful smile hovering on his saffron face
Now there will be no war
Im sorry couldnt save the squadron of planes
had to wait until he arrived you see
And it was too dangerous before to attempt to capture the ship You joined their rotten gang risked death and worse to defeat their plans to save your own people and mine from the horrors of var Atkins exclaimed
By God LiSan you are man Yellow hand and white met and clasped
Hey you fellows came Bart Thomas weak voice from the floor
When you get time you might take three or four of these ropes off me and get me something to wear

HOW THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT WAS DETERMINED ight travels approximately miles second and heres how Professor Michelson first proved it
beam of light was reflected from one of the sides of revolving twelvesided block each side of which was mirror itself
This made successive flashes of light
These rays were sent long distance about mile and were reflected back again from mirror
The distance the twelvesided or faceted mirror moved in the time it took the flash to go to the other mir ror and return was the basis for figur ing the speed of light
BACTERIA WITHIN METEOR here is proof of the possibility of life upon other planets
Pro fessor Charles Lipman of the Uni versity of California claims to have recently discovered living micro scopic organisms in meteorites which have flashed across the ether to Earth from other planets
The interior of the meteorite the professor explained remained cool while the outside burst into flaming fragments
BLUE EYES ARE NOT BLUE
yes that are grey brown or black are so colored because the iris contains pigment of that tint
In the case of blue eyes however the outer layer of the iris is colorless and transparent
The inner layer is ex posed
This is white and reflects and scatters the light which strikes it
The blue rays of light being the shortest are scattered most readily
In consequence the iris which is real ly white appears blue
The blueness of eyes is similar to that of the sky the latter also being caused by the scattering of blue light by the upper atmosphere
CRATERS OF THE MOON stronomers stiii cannot fur nish positive reason for the existence of the craters of the moon

MATHEMATICAL MISTAKE ALTERED THE SCIENCE OF ELECTRICITY LARGE group of eminent scien tists and engineers once made an error in mathematics which altered the whole science of electricity
In congress of engineers and phy sicists from all over the world con vened for the purpose of establishing definitely and permanently the sizes of the various electrical units ohm farad etc
for there was much con fusion in this matter
It was finally decided to make the abampere the absolute or physicists unit of current exactly equivalent to the ampere the practical or engi neers unit of current
On this ba sis the relative magnitudes of the other electrical units in each of the two systems absolute and practical were to be determined
Througn some undetected error in arithmetic the abampere was made equal to onetenth of an ampere and not equal to whole ampere asthe con gress had decided
As result of this error the relative values of all the electrical systems in the two systems are different from vhat the congress set out to make them
Whereas the scientists wished to make an abcou lomb equal coulomb the latter is in stead ten times the former
And so on and on
This error which was never corrected thus altered the en tire science of electricity

CURVED LIGHT cience can now bend light
Pre viously except for the great spacecurvatures vhich Relativists say surround stars and suns no con ceivable agency or material could actually cause light to travel in curve
This feat was accompished by Dr Harry Robert Dittmar of the Du Pont Research Laboratories with the aid of Pontalite new plastic known chemically as methyl methac rylate polymer
Du Pont scientists recently demonstrated that pretzel shaped length of Pontalite could con duct light carry it around bends as cable carries electricity
flashlight was held close to one end of the twist ed plastic tube
The other end of the tube shone brightly
The reason why Pontalite bends light is because of the crystalline structure of the material which re fracts the light in series of very straight lines joined at slight angles like bar links in watch chain so that the light stays inside the conductor until it reaches the end
DOWN on the FARM in the Hygienic Age of the Future Harold Faddley Aged Commits Crime Supreme
By SIMPSON STOKES he hard irregular shape of the selfadjusting Nibbler moved over the grassland like gigan tic mechanical cow only it had cater piller traction bands instead of legs
Its thirtytwo jaws working alter nately in echelons of eight opened
rhythmi cally
Professor Obinson had well remembered the importance of achiev ing conditions as identical as possi ble with those produced by the teeth and jaw action of herbivorous ani mals before the fodder went into the Metabolisers
Farmer Geary watched the Nibbler at work
He saw beyond it the vast threestoried acreages of his Multi pleCrop Flats incongruously tilt ed on the side of Durdleberry Slopes in the distance
The bizarre shadow of the combined WindSuncatcher like spray of tulips mounted fan wise on rotating mast slanted across the meadow
This is good said Geary rubbing his hands
This is fine He had been reading through his accountants estimate of balance and saw every prospect of being nearly ten per cent up on the previous half year
His Soya byproducts his fi brous residues and his Metaboliser It looked like gigantic mechanical cow
DOWN ON THE FAEM fodder all showed most healthy in crease
Indeed the only slight set back had been in the thirdtier Chlo rophyl crops from the Flats and this had been due solely to mechanics unaccountable error in setting the thermostats
Well he would settle this mechanic
Mason it was
He had already appealed to the Commission claiming for the loss to be made good
This would probably reduce Masons superannuation prospects to those of the Third Class unless he made good in the next year or two by earning Maxima Efficiency Bonuses
So Farmer Geary had every reason to feel pleased with himself as he re turned to the gleaming steelandglass farmhouse
He found the Portrals there and old Faddley and his wife and young Tim on vacation from the University of Agriculture
They had been talk ing about old times and new as people will in all ages
The greatest blessing of all Mrs Portral was saying as Farmer Geary stepped in from the lawn well its hard to say
remember when was girl my mother used to tell me about how she used to mix foods together and put them into pots and ovens instead of just heating the carton
She said that it was full days work doing all that unnecessary mixing and cooking and cleaning plates and dishes afterward
Fancy having to use plates and dishes over and over again Couldnt have been really hy gienic agreed Tim
But then the twentyfirst century was never much in advance of the tenth in the busi ness of feeding think that the greatest blessing has been the abolition of edible ani mals said Farmer Geary adjusting recliner and settling himself at the most comfortable angles
Imagine the horrible animal smells and the dirt the sweating skins and sali Dont be coarse Elbert Mrs vating mouths the flies Geary said
Well Ive been to outlandish coun tries where they still have such aw ful habits havent
It nearly made me sick to see the way they depended on vegetation being transmuted through the filthy stomachs of ani mals for meat and milk
Ill give my unhesitating vote to syn thetic Metabolising Plant every time Harold here remembers cows and sheep in this country said Mrs Fad dley
Dont you Harold and Geary shuddered
When was boy near hundred and thirty year ago worked on one of the last of the old farms agreed old Faddley
But was used to it you see and loved the smells of the farmyard and the lowing of the cows and the simple Nature in it all
Thats why Im in the egglayers side of the business today
To handle live birds an to take interest in em reminds me of old times you see They even used to eat chickens as meat in those days didnt they Mr Faddley This was from Tim
course they did Tim
But they wasnt the featherless birds we uses today you see
They had plump flesh and lots of feathers fair bunches of em like you can see at the zoo
And they used to run about the yard an scratch in the ground an peck an cluck an squat in the dust like any thing
Twas music to me ffMJEOPLE killed them Mrs Portral interrupted hastily
Then they plucked all the nasty in sanitary feathers off and then they actually burnt them in ovens lubri cating them with animal fat and pigs meat while they burnt
remember my mother telling me Talk about cannibalism said Portral
The chief business of life today said Geary
The whole business say consists of and should consist of nothing but the efficient production and distribution of foodstuffs and manufactures and the vigilant observ ance of hygiene and sanitation Control of course sir educa tion Tim suggested bashfully
We can leave that to those respon sible Tim quailed before Gearys truculent eye
said the chief busi THRILLING WONDER STORIES ness of life my boy Old Faddley in the arc of the wall near the humidor switch wished that some other topic of conversation had been chosen
The very mention of oldstyle farms brought with it strange nostalgia
While he had been speaking of the smells and sounds of his boyhood days on the land they came back to him with such vividness that he thereafter drifted into day dream
He fancied himself standing by gate watching the cows coming through from the churnedup pathway
There were no sounds of mechanism or whirr of wheels not even the dis tant chugchug of WindSuncatcher
The air was calm warm with peace fulness as the cows came sedately through whisking their tails one after the other pausing for an instant to swing their heads sideward and favor Faddley with meaningless stares
And the field in which they grazed
The surface was delightfully uneven there were tufts and tussocks of grass not the soulless smoothness of mod ern meadows ready for great lumber ing clattering Nibblers to work on
How well he remembered
In the far corner near vhere the cabbages start ed were the hay ricks and vhat pleasing aroma came from them es pecially when the sun came smiling after shower
Pigs and fowls and big farm horses and ducks
He never tired of watching the fam ily of ducks waddling comically after the mother to the dear dirty pond be hind the stables
Dear oh dear
Twas well over century ago
Theres no smell like the farmyard mixture he thought and theres no animal like cow
Nevertheless on emerging from his reverie he felt that he had been be trayed by his unguarded enthusiasm into social indiscretion
He noticed difference in Gearys manner at once
Mrs Portral also had looked at him with an expression of distaste
There was that sort of aloofness evi dent in the room which might have followed the utterance of blas phemy
From that moment Faddley ceased to visit the Gearys
He shrank into his shell
Beyond an occasional busi ness trip by air to Canada or to Ber muda he seldom stirred from his egg farm
He even refused his usual at tendance as delegate at the Egg Union weekend meeting in Rio de Janeiro
Sad about the old man was the general verdict
Getting into the sere and yellow at last
Never was truly with the times you know
Of course he has to be uptodate with production methods because of the Law but at heart hes reactionary People shook their heads and went about their business leaving old Fad dley to his egg hatcheries
Such progressive age with so many diver sions to occupy what used to be known as leisure could easily for get man who properly belonged to the past
But Faddley was destined to emerge from obscurity at last and to dart across the suy of the worlds news like meteor of sensational di mensions
There was scarcely civi lized home in the five continents in which the Faddley Case was not topic of conversation from the mo ment of its first flashing on their visi screens one of the biggest news scoops in the history of the Nord EurbpeAmerica Transmission
ARMER GEARY had authentic firsthand information of the event
He retailed his intelligence with gusto to the visitors who had dropped like locusts on his tarmac oi hearing that he had something to say Thus Geary shared in the sensation to his great satisfaction
In his fa vorite attitude on the recliner he thus held forth can tell you all about it the most amazing thing thats happened in America for many long year He had great opinion of himself as raconteur and meant to make the most of his opportunity now
This fellow Faddley is perhaps the oldest man in the egg business today
Hes old in point of years too
Well most of you know him believe
DOWN ON THE FARM jHere is an instance where the crook edness of age warps mans mind and sends him into groove of madness
suppose he had felt himself gradu ally being left behind by the younger generation you know snubbed would be the word and it preyed on him
Anyhow it turns out that for some months before the tragedy he had indulged in sort of ritualistic retirement meditation and so on in one of his big egg flats that he kept for emergencies
Imagine man of his age locking himself in that enor mous building surrounded by tier upon tier of empty incubators laying boxes and all the paraphernalia of his trade
solitary little figure in that great loneliness tired of the world or disgusted with it dont know which
Hed stay there all day so Mrs Faddley said and most of the night only going indoors to his home toward dawn
Nothing she could say would shake the old fool
If she want ed him to meet company he would growl out that he had no time for it
The man must have been daydream Jng for he had known the whole place inside out for years and that the Re serve Flat had always been empty and had never heard so much as single cluck from layer
Anyhow as the inner door swung open there came to the ears of the inspector dreadful sound like soul in torment echo ing in the back recesses of the Flat and then old Faddley came running out with face as white as death What time yesterday did the ar rest take place asked young air man
was up at the time and had no visiscreen on the dash Seven oclock on Tuesday eve ning replied Geary
About four hours after He was interrupted by the flashing of the visiscreen that occupied the greater part of the wall to his left
By Jove he said heres the end of the tale For the visiscreen flashed Faddley Case Trial Result
Harold James Faddley age of Upman Egg Farm Wilts sentenced to suspension from all public production work with loss of privileges for life
He admitted his guilt on all counts to smuggling from Yunen Province of China by Air Egg Liner to harboring in Federal domains and on scheduled premises to leading on scheduled grassland under con cealment of night contrary to hygienic acts and public laws prohibited animal to wit cow

Lanoth started walking toward the Wanderer his cohorts behind him WANDERER of the VOID By DR ARCH CARR Author of The Discus Men of Ekta Warriors of Eternity etc
PALL of intense sadness lay like blanket upon the grounds and the dullgleaming mansion of Walter Brundage owner of the small dark star Merthel
For Janice Garth Brundages beloved young granddaughter had for many hours lain ill with some strange malady
Miriam Garth mother of the strick en child stood before the screen in the visigraph room impatiently wait ing for the operator to adjust his ap paratus to the broadcast beam
Then at signal from the technician she swept up the portable speech trans mitter
Brundage City on Merthel calls WANDERER OF THE VOID ing the Wanderer
Calling the Wan derer
Emergency call
Brundage City calling the Wanderer
The young woman spoke into the microphone until her throat became dry her voice husky
But there was no answer to her call
The visigraph screen was blank
Had she been too late
If only Daniel her husband were here with her now how much easier it would be to bear
She longed for the comfort of his arms his soft words of encouragement his love
Daniel Garth who had been enmeshed in web of circumstantial evidence built up by lawless conspirators Daniel who had been convicted and sentenced for life in the Plutonian penal institution for crime which he had never committed
Suddenly the glittering surface of the visigraph screen reddened
Words in flat metallic voice crackled from the reproducer
The Wanderer stands by for visual connection with Brundage City Mer thel The visigraph cleared and there ap peared before Miriam Garth the image of the universal man of mystery the Wanderer
weird picture there on the screen the picture of man clad in grotesque black steel space suit of type not generally accepted by rocketmen
No person knowingly had ever gazed upon the features of the Wan derer
There were no transparent windows in his helmet and he had never removed his space shell in the presence of others
Neither had his natural voice ever been known to reg ister upon human ears
Two retinascopic photoelectric cells set in the face of his helmet surmounted the slitted orifice of speech reproducer
On either side of the iron head was sensitive cylin dric microphone
small oxygene rator of peculiar design was affixed to the armor of his shoulders
Thus the Wanderer vas able to breathe see hear and speak without his identity becoming known
Miriam Garth daughter of Valter Brundage calls the Wanderer Mir iam spoke nervously into the trans mitter
My daughter has been brought down by strange form of lethargic encephalitis which our Mer thelian physicians do not understand
Daniel Garth the childs father who is prisoner on Pluto is affected sim ilarly
But Dr Vacor the prison sur geon has been able to keep him alive for three years
feel that if Dr Va cor could see my child there might be chance to save her life Breathless Miriam paused then went on But we have no space ship in which to carry her to Pluto
Bors Lanoth the pirate attacked our city and destroyed the only ship on the planet
If you are near Merthel will wont you take her The Wanderers electromechanical countenance showed no sign of hu man emotion as he replied Prepare the child for the flight
shall land upon Merthel shortly The distant sun pale and anemic plunged beneath the jagged western horizon as the Wanderers trim little ship with braking rockets bellowing mighty challenge to the bleak Mer thelian landscape dropped gently upon the ground near the Brundage mansion
side port in the ship hissed spun open and the Wanderer stood there on the ground waiting his electric eyes casting twin shafts of dull smokyred light into the shadows
Miriam Garth and her father both clad in heavy electrically heated fur garments approached the ship
Wal ter Brundage bore the unconscious form of his granddaughter in his arms
The Wanderer motioned them toward the open port
He waved aside their thanks board ed the ship behind his passengers closed and sealed the port
He made them comfortable and placed the child on springsuspended litter fastened her securely to guard against the strain of acceleration
Then he went to the controls of his oneman ship
He turned to Miriam and her father said Ascension THRILLING WONDER STORIES Ready replied Brundage
The Wanderer glanced at the indi cators before him moved lever
The ship rose rapidly on an even keel her underjets roaring in crescendo
Acceleration Again Brundage spoke their readi ness
With blast of stern rockets the ship shot outward in long arc to ward the disc of Pluto The Wander er his body braced against the sup port rails gradually adjusted the gravitation plates as Merthels pull lessened
After the fierce thrust of accelera tion had subsided Miriam let her eyes linger upon the motionless figure of the pilot
Who was this strange man in black steel armor this weird avenger of crime who was ever ready to assist someone in acute distress
Laymen on every planet had ad vanced the theory that the Wanderer was senseless cosmic ray automa ton remotely controlled by some hu man intelligence
But scientists con tended otherwise
The Wanderer had displayed certain reflexes to un foreseen contingencies they claimed that denoted perfect coordination of mind and body
This could not have occurred the men of science stoutly declared in the case of mechanical robot
The Wanderer had first come into interplanetary prominence by swoop ing to the aid of group of embattled space patrolmen on the inner satellite of Mars and assisting them in the ex termination of band of pirates
Thereafter wandering ceaselessly through the black night of space the Wanderer had waged an almost singlehanded warfare against piracy until but one outlaw leader now re mained alive Bors Lanoth
The Wanderers deeds had made of him legendary figure of romance and mystery had earned him the title Wanderer of the Void
And the fact that he was masked unknown lent glamour to his exploits
He had agreed to reveal his iden tity only when Bors Lanoth last of the space pirates no longer roamed the skies
Thus Miriam sat in meditation fo
many long minutes her mind review ing the Wanderers colorful history her thoughts returning at last to her personal troubles
There was Daniel her husband convicted felon who for three years had lain in deathlike sleep in the Plutonian prison
And now Janice was affected in like manner
What was the nature of this unknown physi cal condition tnat had seized them
Tears started afresh to Miriams eyes
She turned toward the observa tion port beside her gazed out in an abstracted manner
Then she sat up right in her chair
Many miles out across the black ness of space she saw the unmistak able orangered flame from the stern jets of space ship the yellow dots that were portholes in the side of the vessel
She announced her discovery to the Wanderer
Yes he said know
That ship has been pacing us for more than an hour
It is Bors Lanoths flagship manned by his followers from the reptile planet
knov it by the set of its rockets
For long time have sought an encounter with Lanoth fight to the finish
He would never give me that opportunity
But now while am on mission of this sort he brings the fight to me ear tore at Miriams heart with icy fingers
The young womans nerves burning like redhot wires were at the breaking point under the severe mental burden that had been imposed upon her
She slumped listlessly back into her seat suddenly deciding to place her faith blindly in the ironclad creature at the pilot controls before her
Deceleration the Wanderer an nounced
Brundage hastily affixed elasti bar nesses about Miriam and himael The child required no attention
ne she was suspended on all sides
Vibration of the stern ceased
Then abruptly
ilranr fet her frail body surge fcrwiri arans the supporting straps as me braking rockets flamed nt ie
WANDERER OF THE VOID Miriam stared out at Lanoths ship which had now ranged much closer
The craft had cut propulsion rockets and was braking fiercely nosing downward for landing on Pluto
Wind shrieked about the hull of the Wanderers vessel as it hurtled into Plutos frigid atmosphere
The Wanderer regulated the gravitation reactor accordingly
They soon dropped to jarless landing upon an iceincrusted plain near the penal in stitute
The Wanderer brought out space helmets and oxygenerators from locker in the ships nose
As you know Plutos atmosphere at night is but slightly above abso lute zero he said
You will need these to protect your lungs against the extreme cold
There is small one to accommodate the child
All are fitted with shortdistance cosmic ray transmitting and receiving appa ratus The Wanderer placed helmet about the head of each of his passen gers started the oxygenerators saw that the communicating devices were functioning properly
The Wanderers voice boomed in Miriams ears
require no space gear for my self he said as if in answer to the question she had been about to voice
My helmet is sufficient The girl looked at him and won dered
There will be fighting perhaps and you will need weapon The Wanderer looked at Brundage and in dicated rack of guns on the far wall
Brundage selected side arm and long gun provided himself with am munition
The Wanderer inspected the brace of Wauxum highpressure pistols that hung in clip holsters at his own waist
Miriam and Brundage donned their fur garments and the young woman took the child in her arms
They then followed the iron man into the airlock and paused at the quartz win dow in the exit port
Lanoths ship was just settling down some hundred or more yards away the flame from ier under jets blasting out wide berth in the ice plain
It would be best for you to remain on the ship the Wanderer told Miriam
He opened the lock and he and Brundage stepped down upon the ice
Miriam closed the port behind them pressed her face close to the windov her heart thumping madly against her ribs
The dark Plutonian night was bit terly cold hazy with drifting flakes of congealed and frozen atmosphere
Overhead stars glittered with sort of frigid jewellike splendor adding touch of eeriness to the frozen world below
Miriam jerked nervously at the burst of white illumination that sud denly came from the pirate ship
She could now see plainly her father and the Wanderer striding purposefully across the ice crystals
port in the great ship opened and spaceclad man whom Miriam in stantly knew to be Lanoth leaped out
The young woman shuddered almost Overwhelmed with nausea at sight of the reptilian horde that poured out of the lock behind the pirate leader
ALF man half crocodile they ap peared to be walking upright upon their short stubby hindlegs their long horny tails sliding upon the ice
single large eye set in the center of their foreheads glowed with baleful luminosity
They leaped and cavorted about Lanoth brandishing weapons grasped in their webbed hands
They wore no space suits for they were inhabitants of planet far more frigid than Pluto
Lanoth waved them back and start ed walking toward the Wanderer
The two men halted facing each other at distance of thirty feet
Brun dage was to the left and slightly back of the Wanderer bis long gun held in readiness
The communicating device in Mir iams helmet brought their conversa tion to her
Ho Wanderer
We meet at last Yes Lanoth we meet
But not at time to my liking
have on board my ship child vho is at the very THRILLING WONDER STORIES threshold of death
Her life is meas ured in minutes unless Dr Vacor the prison surgeon takes her in charge immediately
Let me pass with she and her mother and give you my word shall return What care if the child dies Lanoth snarled
You are indeed dull of wit
Wanderer if you do not realize that this situation is little short of perfect for the fulfillment of my plans
shall cancel the old charge against Brundage as well as the one against you Miriam saw her father surge for ward heard him rasp Damn your black soul Lanoth
Ill gun flashed in the hand of rep tile man
Brundage spun slumped to the ice lay still
The Wanderer fell into crouch came up with mechanical precision flaming gun grasped in each of his metal hands
Lanoth gave ground before the terrible fusillade
He had not been able to match the Wander ers lightning double draw
But now his guns were out and up blasting forth the hatred of their owner
The Wanderer his own guns jerk ing viciously marched steadily for ward into the blazing death that hur tled at him from the hands of his ad versary
Behind Lanoth the reptile men held their fire fearful of strik ing their leader
Crouching beside the window in the little space ship Miriam Garth heard the clang of bullets against the hel mets and armor of the men on the snow plain before her felt the vibra tion as missiles struck the hull of the vessel
Brundage was moving now was getting on his feet
He had only been stunned by the bullet
The helmet had saved him
He brought up his rapidfire long gun brought it to bear upon Lanoths followers pressed the trigger
But the pirates closed in upon him slow ly inexorably despite the menace of his gun
Lanoth and the Wanderer were close together now still blazing away at each other
Miriam marveled that either of them had survived the with ering fire from the others guns
La noth began to weave about from side to side
And then the Wanderer dropped to one knee
Up Miriam shrieked into the little microphone in her helmet
Get up
Wanderer The Wanderer shook his head as if to clear his brain got slowly and wearily back to his feet
He took de liberate aim and his left gun spat once at the pirate leader
Lanoth stag gered the weight of his guns swung his limp arms to his sides and he crashed to the ice in crumpled heap
The reptile men came forward in rush
Miriam was about to turn from the window when suddenly from out of the darkness in the direction of the penal institute there charged more than hundred spaceclad giants some swinging huge swords above their heads others firing Wauxum guns rapidly as they ploughed through the frosty ice dashing straight toward the band of half men
Some of the pirate crew sought to escape by fleeing into their ship
But their line was quickly broken hacked to pieces by flickering doubleedged swords blasted out of existence by guns in capable hands
Soon it was all over
Out there on the ice lay the members of Lanoths inhuman crew
None lived save those who had sealed themselves in the pi rate ship
ope blossomed anew in Mir iams heart
Guards from the prison had come to the Wanderers aid had defeated the pirates and made it possible for Janice to be taken on to Dr Vacor
Perhaps it was not yet too late Suddenly Lanoths ship shot up ward at an angle stern first with half her underjets working
The big ves sel rolled and pitched her banks of keel rockets firing intermittently
The surviving reptile men were mak ing desperate effort to take off from Pluto
Evidently unskilled hands were at the pilot controls
The roar of cross talk in Miriams phone ceased abruptly
An author WANDERER OF THE VOID tative voice spoke crisply in the Plu tonian tongue
Then as the pirate craft nosed skyward under power of its propulsion rockets thin line of green flame lanced up from the roof of the prison
Two glononite shells exploded with fierce white glare against the for ward hull of the laboring space ship
third tore away her jets
She rolled over slowly folded nose upon stern and plunged downward seared and twisted mass of wrecked metal to final resting place in the bleak moun tain range that fanged the eastern sk
Space piracy in the Universe had ended Miriam knew with the de struction of that mighty ship
The Wanderers crusade was finished and the iron man could now unmask re veal his identity and retire to life of peace and quiet
Who was the Wanderer
And what was the grudge that Lanoth had harbored against Walter Brundage
Brundage the Wanderer and two of the guardsmen approached the lit tle ship
They were coming to take Janice on to the prison hospital to Dr Vacor
What would Janice find there life
Yes possibly
Life in the form of an encephalitic lethargy that would drift ultimately into death Miriams taut nerves gave way
The young woman fainted slid slowly to the floor still tightly clasping her unconscious child to her bosom
Later Miriam Garth opened her eyes in the prison hospital
She was on long examining table and Dr Yedell Vacor was bending over her
The huge physician offered small vial filled with thick yellow liquid
She swallowed the drug and immedi ately felt new life surge through her veins
Vacor smiled said Our roof look out observed your encounter with the pirates and we sent guardsmen to your assistance
They brought you here
Your daughter is safe in the room with her father She has she regained conscious ness Vacors face clouded
She has not Mistress Garth
It is case that baf fles me
Her condition is the same as her fathers and have been able to do nothing for him other than to keep him alive with intravenous injections of concentrated food and to take pre cautions against the collapse of his digestive system through disuse What is the nature of his illness Miriam asked
Three years ago Earth time said Vacor when your husband came to serve his sentence in this prison ha made most unusual request
He asked to be placed in chamber that had been specially insulated with certain combination of metals
Daniel Garth was scientist of prominence not man with criminal record so as superintendent of the institution consented
knew he had sufficient reasons
Shortly after his entrance here he fell into stupor and physical degen eration set in rapidly
The latter ceased immediately however when he was placed in the insulated room
have kept life in him but have failed to restore him to consciousness for one small instant
He is not dis eased he has fallen before the influ ence of some strange electrical ema nation the nature of which cannot understand
Neither can discover its source
Your daughter is in the room with her father
Perhaps some day they will recover completely
do not know iriam tugged at the physi cians sleeve
You have not told me everything Doctor she exclaimed her voice edged with hysteria
thing like this could not just happen
know that this wave of electrical energy has been intentionally directed against Daniel and Janice by some intelligent being some person who wishes to destroy them both
And if they are securely shielded from the wave why do they not regain con sciousness
You have formed some theory Doctor
You must tell me You are correct
Mistress Garth in your assumption that deliberate THRILLING WONDER STORIES attempt has been made upon the lives of your husband and daughter
have definitely established that fact
The prison cosmic ray engineers have registered the emanation on their de tectors but the wave is of such an in finitely high frequency that their in struments are not sufficiently sensi tive to indicate the direction from whence it comes But you have not explained why they do not regain consciousness Vacor spoke slovly
Indeed have not
And find it the most dif ficult of all explanations
am medical man not scientist well versed in electrodynamics or cosmic ray radiation so shall make the situ ation as clear to you as possibly can
The human body as well as any given amount of matter vibrates at certain frequency peculiar to its own size weight and chemical composi tion
To subject human body to wave whose frequency is the same as its own would bring about number of physical changes
The brain would be most disastrously affected since it is the seat of the senses
The fierce upheaval of the identical frequencies beating together would almost in stantly obliterate the mind drive out the ego the intelligence
Next there would follow general breaking down of the vital organs There was deathlike pallor upon Miriams face and her voice sounded hollow in the great room
Then the minds of Daniel and Janice have been utterly destroyed Not destroyed Vacor said but released from their bodies He mo tioned toward the darkness beyond the window
They are out there perhaps or in this very room with us
We do not know cannot know unless they return to their bodies
Let us hope they do so Miriam pondered the immensity of the thought
It was beyond credence
Human intelligences torn from their fleshy garments to be hurled naked out into eternity
Where else
Drifters in time and space
Would they ever return to their bodies or was there some unknown and immu table physical law that would pre vent At this point Walter Brundage came to the table
Lanoth has regained consciousness and wishes to make statement before he dies he said
The Wanderer wants you as witness Doctor They crossed the large room and entered small operating cell in the surgery department on the left
The Wanderer and prison physi cian stood at either end of metal table on which there lay broad shouldered young Earthman
The dying man turned his head slightly so that his failing eyes might bear upon the newcomers
Miriam Garth gasped
Why she faltered why its Jean
Jean Gossard
cant believe it Yes Miriam the whitefaced man on the table murmured Jean Gos sard your childhood playmate is Bors Lanoth the pirate
make this statement so that may find some measure of peace in death Lanoth or Gossard coughed blood bubbling on his lips
Dr Vacor administered stimulant
The pirate rested moment then went on As you know Miriam Daniel Garth and both loved you when we were youngsters on Earth
You cared only for Daniel
This caused me to hate him to hate you to hate even your father
Neither of you ever sus pected it for guarded my secret closely
My hatred flamed higher when Daniel finished his science course at the university with high honors while failed miserably
Something happened to my mind do not know what and swore to make each of you pay dearly for what then considered great wrong
TOOK space ship to Venus and there joined band of pi rates
Using the name Bors Lanoth eventually became their leader and built up powerful organization
It is not necessary to recount our deeds now
They are well known to you
When denexium was discovered on Merthel and your father went WANDERER OF THE VOID there Miriam to supervise personally the mining felt that my revenge was close at hand
And when you and Daniel joined him it was who took the cargo of denexium which Daniel Garth was accused of stealing
worked out the false evidence that convicted him
He is innocent pained expression twisted the features of Walter Brundage
He bowed his head
should have known it he mut tered
am sorry Miriam Miriam placed her cheek against her fathers shoulder took his big hand in her small ones
Lanoths words came again in whisper And it was who subjected Daniel to the ray that forced his intelligence from his body
But did not direct wave against his daughter
She after attaining certain age and size and being the child of Daniel Garth and consequently of similar chemical construction became affected by harmonic of the fundamental wave from my transmitter
She became at tuned in much the manner as we in order to escape etheric noises and dis tortion adjust our visigraph receiv ers to harmonic of the transmitting station Why did you not transmit this wave against Garth early in his year of bonded freedom Vacor asked
wished to greatly Lanoth re plied feebly because feared he would trace the stolen denexium to its buyer on Mars
But did not per fect my transmitter until the latter part of the year
Then mmch experi mentation was necessary in order to determine the natural wave length of his body Where is this transmitter Brun dage demanded
It was destroyed with my ship
There is no longer an emanation La noth turned his head slightly
Now Wanderer you have vanquished me
The the universe is waiting to learn your identity
Tell them as you promised
And And Jean Gossard alias Bors La noth the pirate was dead
But the Wanderer said nothing
He was leaning against the wall for sup port his arms hanging motionless at his sides the red glow in his electric eyes dimming rapidly
Miriam suddenly remembered that she had seen him shot down in his battle with the pirate
The Wan derer is wounded she cried
La noth shot him will attend him Vacor ex claimed
As Vacor started toward the Wan derer young physician dashed into the room
Vacor he said breathlessly
Daniel Garth and the child are re gaining consciousness
Come quick ly With glad cry Miriam ran past the young doctor and out of the room
Brundage and Vacor supporting the Wanderer between them followed
weak and slightly emaciated Daniel Garth sat on the side of his cot smiling
Miriam flung herself into her husbands arms tears of glad ness streaming dovn her cheeks
Daniel she choked
Garth spoke soft words of greet ing
Little Janice who sat on the cot beside her father said That was bad old dream had daddy Brundage and Vacor came in with the limp heavy body of the Wanderer sagging between them
Both spoke heartily to Garth
Daniel Garth laughed
Do not concern yourselves further with that heap of metal he said
Toss it into corner
have finished with it The two men stared
What do you mean Vacor asked quickly suspiciously
mean said Garth that you are burdening yourselves with an inani mate object Brundage turned to Vacor
Perhaps his brain is not yet clear he said
ARTH laughed again
My mind is perfectly clear assure you
will explain
built that robot in my laboratory on Merthel some years ago
synthesized brain which THRILLING WONDER STORIES placed in its skull
The auditory nerves are connected with the micro phones that serve as ears the optical nerves with the retinascopic photo electric cells and the nerves of speech with the reproducer
The motor nerves Doctor are con nected with the mechanism that acti vates the robots body delicate relays making and breaking the different cir cuits in the course of motivation
Power comes from small almost in exhaustible battery of my own design
The brain is nourished by certain fluid pump circulates through it ACOR and Brundage placed the robot in chair
It is marvelous Vacor murmured
do not fully understand how the synthetic brain am coming to that Garth went on
Years ago on Earth Jean Gos sard Bors Lanoth and experi mented with high frequency wave which we hoped would release the hu man intelligence from the body
We obtained little success and gave up
On Merthel experimented further wishing to liberate my own intelli gence so that might project it into the brain of the robot
Then was convicted of stealing cargo of denexium and was forced to give up my laboratory work
To ward the latter part of my year of bonded freedom traced the denex ium to certain buyer in Dotho Mars
secreted myself in this buyers ware house several times and gained much information
learned that it was Lanoth who had stolen the stuff and made it appear that was the thief
further learned that Lanoth was about to loose secret wave against me
The pirate was aware of my ef fort to trace the metal and he did not want me to prove my innocence
Peculiar physical symptoms which experienced later indicated that La noth had started transmitting his wave
The symptoms disappeared be fore had suffered to any great ex tent only to return at regular intef vals for several days
Then they ceased
The realiaation suddenly came to me that this was the sanie ray with which Gossard and had experiment ed on Earth
Lanoth then must be Jean Gossard
And he was seeking to find the natural wave length of my body
Soon he would be successful
With only few days of liberty remaining to me hastened to Mer thel changed the appearance of my space ship placed the robot on board and hid the ship in mountain range near Brundage City
Then came here to start serving my sentence and requested the insulated room
want ed Lanoths ray to release my intelli gence but wished my body shielded against physical deterioration
When the ray forced out my in telligence shall call my intelli gence entered the brain of the robot and started warfare against Lanoth and piracy in general
too perfected ray transmitter and incor porated it in the body of the robot in order that might project my ego out of the synthetic brain when nec essary
released my intelligence tonight just after Lanoth died and my in telligence went out to assist Janices drifting ego back into her little body
You have heard Lanoths statement now with mine you have clear pic ture of the whole affair Walter Brundage stepped forward
My boy he said huskily do not know what to say about the part took in prosecuting you
What can do Erase it from your memory Garth told him
The thunder of Vacors voice filled the room

NEJLT ISSUE TME SIJPfiEME ONE master oP MERCURy Novelette of World Conquest The ASTOUNDING CHAPTER Dying World ERNOQ stood alone upon the balcony
At his back towered the observatory with its mammoth telescope
Below the balcony rough rocky clifs fell away to meet the restless sea which rolled and tossed fretfully
He swept the vast panorama before him with lidless eyes
From this prominence the country was visible for miles
Off to one side in the dis tance loomed jagged peaks
On one of these stood power plant an en ergy radiator one of the countless broadcasters which dotted Earth in the portions still inhabited by men
The man if such he could be called gazed into the darkening heavens
Behind the observatory the sun hung low in the sky
It had been that way for several hours its slow movement barely perceptible
Earths rotation was many times slower after five mil lion years
Mernoq himself represented an amazing spectacle
He was man whom his ancestors of five million years before would have disowned as an incredible monster
Given lati tude of fifty thousand centuries evo lution had worked strange pranks on mankind
The biped which had held reign over Earths dominions for the greater share of his long varied ex istence was much unlike his predeces sors of the remotely distant mechani cal age
Was it fate coincidence or domi nating undying spark which had seen Mankind Speeds Beyond the Stars to Flee
EXODUS By NEIL JONES Author of Little Her cules The Jameson Satellite etc
mankind triumphant over all obstacles which had beset his path
Since the mechanical age man had alternately scaled the heights of Utopia and had tasted the dregs of chaos and degene ration
Oblivions stark shadow had fallen often across the portals of civ ilization yet the human race had proved itself undying
Years of worldly strife had come and gone insect scourges had threat ened and nearly won pestilence had waved its grimy scepter throughout the Solar System and there had been interplanetary warfare
Worst of all there had come invasion by space wanderers creatures from the faroff stars nearly invincible and equally as threatening
Mankind on its plan ets and moons of the Solar System had suffered enslavement
Only by the The weird cavalcade Bled inside the illuminated chamber destruction of Venus entire atmos phere had mankind destroyed the in the Lifeless Solar System of the Fyfyre THRILLING WONDER STORIES vaders
This had happened long ago yet the Earthmen remembered
Mernoq was typical Earthman
He stood between four and five feet in height
Standing upright on two legs which were jointed to move in either of two directions he had four arms two on each side each member terminating in eight fingers
The legs were much longer than the body
During the last hundred thousand years or more the body had grown smaller due to the increasing diminu tion and final disappearance of the di gestive tract and organs of respira tion
To keep alive humanity no longer found it necessary to eat and breathe
Science had supplanted the compara tively short existence of the gastric organs with more practical means of austenance
Mans radioactive blood was kept charged with energy from the huge broadcasting units
Oxygen was superfluous
In this manner the life span had been materially in creased until life of ten thousand years had become common
The head of Mernoq had neither mouth nor nostrils
Like the appen dix of man the unused mouth had finally disappeared
Food no longer existed and articulate speech had long since yielded to mental telepa thy
On either side of the head were slightly elongated ears curved to catch the slightest of sounds
Two black lidless eyes peered intently from the face intelligence radiating from their depths
Humanity had done away vith sleep
Like food and oxygen it vas no longer necessary
The energy broadcasters recharged the body constantly
Hair that telltale mark of barbar ism had become unknown among Earthmen
Instead of hair there arose from the head fully two dozen anten nae
These served double purpose
They picked up the thought waves of their fellowmen and also received the broadcasted energy which supplied their bodies
Mernoq stood looking at the distant broadcaster which threw pink waves of light in every direction
From this station he and the members of the ob servatory staff received the energy their bodies required
Reception ex cept in the case of the more powerful broadcasters was limited to thou sand miles or less
number of broadcasters in jE
one vicinity varied in accordance with the amount of population
There were few spots on Earths surface vhere one stood in danger of starva tion
Turning Mernoq entered the ob servatory climbing few short steps to where several of his companions were grouped about table
Upon it stood intricate machines
Several of the Earthmen were gazing at large screen upon which the great telescope projected what it saw
large pair of fiery stars occupied the center of the field
Mernoq spoke mentally
The antennae of his comrades quiv ered slightly in attentiveness
The long night will soon be upon us with its terrible coldness
Then we must retreat into the sealed cham bers Sirius is nov nearing the zenith Eloow indicated the bright double star with wave of his arm
It is time that Uljoph returned said one of the others
He has been gone over thirtyfive years on his ex pedition to the twin suns of Sirius rumor has come to me said Mernoq
Do not yet fear that the expedition has become lost in space
Perhaps tonight our telescope may pick up the returning space ship rumor wnat have you heard Manipulating set of controls at his side Eloow looked up inquiringly into the face of Mernoq
The rest watched the screen eagerly
Sirius dimmed away into the distance as the telescopic field was brought closer to Earth
Vacuum yawned blackly at them
Black and empty Reod ex claimed
Mernoq remained silent in spite of this gloomy remark
He was think ing deeply
Earth was dying planet
space expedition had been sent to Alpha Centauri in an effort to find planet outside the dead Solar System THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS to which mankind might migrate
Al pha Centauri was found to possess sixteen planets none of them how ever suitable for habitation
The ex pedition to Sirius had immediately followed
We shall wait five years more said Mernoq and then another ex pedition will start out for still an other star But where It has not been definitely decided
Many of the nearer stars have been suggested
But we shall give this ex pedition time to prove itself
Both Uljoph and Aamon are among the best commanders of the Earthmen Why didnt you go yourself in stead of Aamon
He has always seemed bitter against you for your unparalleled success especially be cause the Earthmen have placed their faith and reliance in you to lead them know Mernoq replied
That is the very reason sent him
gave him the chance to distinguish himself along with Uljoph
Aamon is men tal genius and should be encouraged What of tonight Eloow wanted to know
You said you had had word We have observed nothing with our telescope replied Mernoq
The observatory at Yigni however has sent me strange reports
As you are probably aware they not only have the most powerful telescope in the world but the most erratic one
They have sacrificed clarity for greater magnification
received report from Bralel who is stationed there
He reports seeing flash of the expe ditions space ship returning from Sirius
The vision blotted and faded
He gave me his telescopic figures
If those at Yigni really saw the space ship coming home calculated that it would show up on our screen either today or else tonight his information acted as balm for the impatience of the Earth men
But fully two months were to elapse before the space ship actually arrived
Radio communication at that distance was impossible
Civili zation waited expectantly and anx iously
Failure had crowned previ ous effort
Optimism however ruled to such marked extent that partial preparations had been made for de parture from Earth
The laboratories and workshops were kept busy
One Question was uppermost in the minds of all
Had Uljoph and Aamon found perfect world in the system of Siri us or had failure fallen upon the Earthmen once more
And then one day the ship arrived plumbing Earths waning atmosphere at greatly reduced speed
Out of it poured the forces of Uljoph and Aamon
They were unusually jubi lant and seemed glad to be among their own kind once more after de parture of three and half decades
They immediately joined Mernoq
Why did you not radio he asked them
Our proximity with Sirius de stroyed many vital parts of our send ing apparatus but we heard your mes sages before entering the Solar Sys tem Uljoph replied
it will be necessary to construct our sending apparatus on different principles when we return once more within the influence of Sirius stated Aamon
Return echoed Mernoq
Then you have been successful We have was the enthusiastic reply
it was colorful story which Uljoph related
After fifteen years of space flight they had reached Sirius dis covering that it possessed twenty seven planets
The planets varying in size presented varying conditions
Many of them had moons
Commenc ing from the innermost planet the Earthmen had explored them all even to the outermost world distantly re moved from the dazzling orbs of Sirius
Two worlds had been found to be ideal
They were the sixth and eighth planets
The seventh world was habitable but was overrun with rank vegetation and loathsome forms of life
Zyse the sixth planet was much to be preferred
Bexn the eighth world teemed with animal life
THRILLING WONDER STORIES boasting strange race of intelligent creatures
Zyse was by far the most beautiful world of the entire system
We must desert this wornout world said Mernoq
The vanguard of our people will soon start for Zyse But there must be more prepara tions made Aamon argued
We cannot start at once Mernoq saw with disappointment that Aamons attitude was antagonis tic
He saw enmity in his glance the enmity which Mernoq hoped he would have lost on the trip to Sirius
The great leaders reply however was conciliatory
Yes preparations are indeed nec essary before the greater share of us leave for the new world he admit ted
Yet during your absence our optimism led us to construct many space ships
vast fleet of them is equipped and ready now on Mars No
do not intend leaving for the new system until the last con tingent goes
That will be long time yet
shall go with the last ships which are to carry the valuable kletin metal now stored on Venus Months later the waiting space ships on the planet Mars headed for Zyse
They were the forerunners of the exodus the first ships to leave the old System
From that time on ships continually left for the new home planet until several years later there were but few left
Strangely enough Aamon showed no desire to head contingents to Zyse
Mernoq was glad for Aamon was valuable and seemed to have got over his old envy
CHAPTER II Beneath the Monolith HEARTH had become nearly aban doned as Mernoq and two hun dred of his men stood on the desolate planet Venus
The suns huge globe hung just at the edge of the horizon
Venus had ceased rotating
One side forever faced the sun red hot hem isphere
The other side frozen cold by the temperature of space lay dark and as equally deserted
The atmosphere was gone ter rific war with the invaders from distant star had destroyed the en velope of air ripped open fissures in the planet released the inner ele ments and had blown the cruel invad ers into eternity
Venus was as dead and deserted as Earths moon or Mars
Stars shone crystal clear all about the sun gleam ing and twinkling
In space suits the forces of Mernoq walked over the cold surface of the planet
Mernoq had brought the space ship to rest upon the narrow thousand mile strip of shadowland between the cold and flaming hemispheres of the dead world
Mernoq now gave instruc tions to Aamon
Stay with the ship while we de scend into the underground chambers after the kletin metal
Be sure that the energy broadcaster continues to function properly
We shall be back shortly Enclosed in the bulky space suits with their multitude of exterior ap paratus the Earthmen headed for tall monolith rising from clump of rocks which strewed its base
Reod shone peculiar ray of green inten sity from his space suit upon the broad base of the tover
Almost im mediately doorway opened
In long line the weird cavalcade filed inside and down broad flight of steps into large chamber
The walls glowed radiating an ethereal light of their own
In the center of the chamber stood massive machine its various parts formed of intricate apparatus
This was the auxiliary energy broadcaster to be used in case the one on the space ship failed or in the event that the space ship was moved away from the vicinity
The sides of the vast cham ber were pierced with small doorways leading to the storerooms of the kle tin
When charged with peculiar force of light produced by the Earth men this metal furnished gravity for the floors of space ships
It was to be found in large quantities upon the planet Uranus and the Earthmen had mined considerable of it on this far THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS planet and moved it to Venus for storage
In groups the Earthmen entered the storerooms and started the remov al of the kletin
Mernoq saw one of the Earthmen walk toward him with load in his four arms
It was Ibaeg and his action seemed strange one
Others were also emerging from the storerooms with the metal but with the exception of Ibaeg they were all heading for the broad stairway lead ing to the surface
Ibaeg where are you taking that The man made no reply but hurried his pace
He ran straight for the en ergy broadcaster
Mernoq and his subordinates were standing at the op posite end of the machine
Ibaeg was approaching from the other side
Sensing trouble of some sort Uljoph hurried toward Ibaeg seeking to in tercept him
But he was not quick enough
Striding up to the dormant energy plant Ibaeg threw with all four arms his load of metal into the mechanism
There came crashing note of twisted parts
ernoq stared aghast at this strange action uncomprehend ing
The miscreant legged it for the flight of stairs those near him too surprised to think of pursuit
Be sides Aamon and more of the Earth men were in the space ship outside
Ibaeg could not escape
His action had been that of madman
It was seemingly pointless
At the foot of the stairs Uljoph stopped and stared upward
Are you mad he demanded
Ibaeg made no reply
He was near ly to the doorvay vhich led from the monoliths base when terrific roar shook the subterranean chamber
Then came mighty concussion as if gigantic body had thudded against the ground far above
With fright ful crash and billowing accompani ment of dust great white boulder svept Ibaeg off his feet and beneath it rolling dovm the stone steps grinding them to powder and smash ing into the rocky wall
Uljoph leaped out of the way just in time
The curtain of rock dust spread like veil as large pieces fell from the fractured wall blocking the up ward passage completely
The monolith has fallen ex claimed Reod
He stared at the ruins in dismay
There was an explosion All became quiet
The rock dust settled slowly
For moment the Earthmen surveyed the clogged pas sage in mental silence
Not square foot of opening was left
They were sealed as if in tomb
We must signal Aamon
He can dig us out with disintegrators call was sent out to Aamon
The reply which came back jarred the sen sibilities of the Earthman worse than had the strange action of Ibaeg or the succeeding explosion of the monolith
Mernoq your reign is at an end came his vindictive thought waves
Ibaeg did his work well
The broad caster is broken and you are en tombed
When leave for Earth you will all die
shall be free to build my own empire in the new sys tem of planets But my men have loyal men aboard ship exclaimed Mernoq more out of surprise and consterna tion than contradiction
Dead Mernoq all dead just as you shall soon be gloated Aamon
My supporters are many
now re turn to Earth where shall set time explosion to detonate the Earths at mosphere in the same manner em ployed by the Earthmen who de stroyed the atmosphere of Venus ages ago You are mad Aamon shall be safe far beyond the So lar System when the cataclysm takes place
When reach Zyse shall conquer the Martian vanguard of ships and all other ships which have left since then
alone shall be all powerful
Now die Mernoq you and all your puppets Mernoq looked around at his com panions who were stricken dumb by the rapid succession of events all planned so well by the evil genius of Aamon
In each others eyes they read the agreement of the certain doom to befall them
The space ship contain ing the source of their sustenance
THRILLING WONDER STORIES was gone
The auxiliary plant in the chamber where they stood was wrecked
Their situation was truly desperate
have two hours in which to live was Mernoqs quiet yet deadly ultimatum
We may be able to repair the damage which Ibaeg did but unless we hurry such re pairs Several of the Earthmen who were skilled mechanics set to work on the damaged broadcaster
They worked steadily removing the damaged parts and repairing them
Time moved by
An insidious sensation of weakness commenced creeping over the Earth men
Suddenly one workman swayed diz zily
Another workman sprang to the task taking the place of his fallen comrade
Mernoq experienced strong urge to sit down
His legs seemed no longer capable of holding his body upright
He fought desper ately against this urge
When his knees sagged he was promptly caught in the arms of companion who eased him gently to the floor
The time he inquired
How long have we Less than half an hour for most of us was the grim reply
few of us may last even longer than that Mernoq felt himself lapsing into unconsciousness
Fully threequar ters of the Earthmen had weakened and fallen
Some retained their senses yet were too feeble to move
The lack of energy was making itself felt
The the lever came the weak mental communication from one of the Earthmen who staggered to the machine with the two remaining parts
Two of his companions weaved in the direction of the starting lever while the other stood at his side to assist him
Behind them Mernoq rose weakly upon his four hands
strong sub conscious prompting had returned him to consciousness
He seemed un able to rise
He watched Cyponom reach for the lever with one hand his remaining three arms clinging to va rious nearby portions of the machine to support his sagging body
Yxlese reeled helplessly against his fellow mechanic dropping the re maining bit of apparatus in its place
The piece had only to be fastened
Yxlese reached out weakly to give the necessary twist
His arms stiffened and never reached the mechanism for his supporting comrade fell Yxlese slumping across his inert body
Through haze of semiconscious ness Cyponom watched Mernoq crawl forward through an effort of tremen dous will power reach the machine and pull himself slowly upward
dizzy mist obscured the vision of Cy ponom
When it cleared he saw Mernoq sag backward and hit the floor
Cyponoms heart sank
At the last vital moment failure had mocked them
He was the only one left with his senses part of them and they were rapidly leaving him
He clung tight but seemed too weak to hang on any longer
He felt his grip weak ening
His eyes wandered to the part which Mernoq had made one final ef fort to reach and turn
His heart skipped beat
It was fastened
Mernoq had reached it
darkness overwhelmed Cyponom
The final or der from his brain commanded three reluctant arms to drop their holds and seize the lever which the other arm held with its eight fingers
As Cyponom fell the weight of his body pulled the lever
grinding noise issued from the machine
Pink vibrations of light danced from the apparatus forming shimmer of color around it
Strewed about the vast chamber lay nearly two hundred un conscious Earthmen many of them close to death
CHAPTER III Entombed he broadcaster roared into ac tion
Soon the reviving Earth men their antennae picking up the energy from the waves which pene trated their space suits commenced to rise THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS How much better off are we now lamented Reod
We are entombed We are alive returned Mernoq spiritedly and while life still exists within our bodies we may yet dare to hope The philosophy of Mernoq was sound
Upon this philosophy man kind had clung tenaciously to life throughout the ages in the face of ad versity
How are we to reach Earth with out space ships even if we do escape this place queried Uljoph
Reaching Earth is but half as im portant as sending out warning of Aamons treachery and his plans to explode the atmosphhere But we have no way of getting to Earth nor any way of signalling in time to forestall Aamons plan said Uljoph
have plan Mernoq told them desperate plan one depending upon close calculations and long chances but first we must get free of this place Mernoq would not divulge his hopes
First he said they must win through to the surface of Venus
The outlook was discouraging
On three sides solid rock surrounded them
The bowels of the planet lay beneath their feet while overhead lay heavy strata of mantle rock
The avenue before them was blocked with massive fragments of the great monolith in terspersed with rock debris from the cracked walls of the passage
once heard of secret exit from this place said Nenerm
Where is it do not know was the uncertain reply
These chambers are old
No one alive can remember when they were built
There is legend telling of an attempted escape of the space invaders long ago
group of them burrowed deep inside Venus
They were all destroyed by the earthquakes which followed the destruction of the atmosphere
passage from these caverns is supposed to lead through their secret exit Then why were these caverns not destroyed by the quakes asked Mernoq
That is what throws doubt on the truth of the legend replied Nanerm yet the legend exists Mernoq at once ordered his men to tap the rock walls in search of hol lows beyond
The Earthmen spread out into small groups searching care fully the adjoining storerooms as well as the central chamber
Both wall and floor space was nearly covered before an excited telepathic commu nication burned itself upon his brain
We have found it Mernoq and his subordinate officers hurried to the spot
Several of the Earthmen held back section of rock which balanced nicely on convex axis
dark passageway lay beyond
Uljoph advanced into it but Mernoq motioned him back
Let the stone swing into place he said
We must be sure that it is dependable and will open at the right time in case we must return this way he stone swung back
As Mer noq had feared the opening of the secret door had been gropingly accidental
After much experiment the concealed exit was reopened
combination of pressure movements on the nearby wall was necessary
Mernoq and his men took careful note of these
He was then satisfied to en ter
He detailed twenty of the Earth men to stay with the energy broad caster and keep it working properly
Watch it carefully
Our lives and yours depend upon it
We shall fol low this passage to the end
If we fail to reach the surface we shall re turn
If we win through we shall communicate with you when we ar rive back at the spot where the mono lith stood With these parting instructions Mernoq and the remainder of the Earthmen snapped on the glowing lights of their space suits and filed into the cavity out of sight around bend in the tunnel
The opening was closed softly behind them
They tramped for miles through the interior of Venus the tunnel slop ing gradually downward
Mernoq commenced to despair of ever reach ing the surface yet he was determined THRILLING WONDER STORIES to follov
the tunnel to its termina tion
It became warm excessively so
Although the surface of Venus was dead and cold the interior was not
The Earthmen became aware of this more than ever as the passage continued its downward slant
Then through the gloom ahead of them they saw the end of the subter ranean passage
It ended blankly yet as they approached nearer and their lights dispelled the shadows they saw faint square outlines of huge door
vague murmur beyond made them pause and grow apprehen sive
Mernoq broke the suspense by ordering it opened
Several of the Earthmen seized the huge metal pull shaking loose from it the dust of ages
No lock was in evidence
Constructed of stone and metal the door was massively built towering far above the height of the Earthmen who tugged at it
Con trary to the expectations of Mernoq however the door opened easily part ly of its own volition so it seemed as if it had waited patiently through the long centuries
Had the Earth men only known it the door had re mained closed for more than quar ter million years
black dust vomited forth from the doorway whirling and falling among the Earthmen
There followed rumble like thunderclap
Beyond the doorway lay vast cavern whose high walls threw back the red and green glow of lurid flames
To their startled eyes were revealed long tongues of fire shooting up to lick the ceiling
They were no such flames as the burning of oxygen might pro duce
The flames were red and termi nated in oval tips edged with blue green luminosity
Come Mernoq strode fearlessly in ie di rection of the raging inferno
His men followed
In warm palpable dust which rose nearly to their knees they walked slowly toward the brilliant fire which as they approached nearer they found issuing from broad deep crevice in the cavern floor
The internal fires of Venus never believed they came so close to the surface They stopped at the edge of the fife pit and looked across to where the cavern stretched away into the gloom
Dimly visible were several rocky corridors
Mernoq lingered for mo ment undecided as to directions but he saw that one end of the crevice might be skirted and ordered the cor ridors to be explored
They circled the flaming cauldron to see what lay beyond
Uljoph drew Mernoqs at tention to the cavern ceiling
was perfectly circular
The cav ern was not artificial
An intelli gence had constructed it
Was the legend true
Had the invaders fash ioned this place as tomb or hidea way or had mankind made their way to the internal fires long ago in the forgotten past
Mernoq wondered
They walked close to the ragged edge of the crevice and peered downward
The fiery hell was fully hundred yards across lurid flames obscuring the bottom
Hidden by the flames boiling inferno of molten rock gushed in and out of the planets interior
mental cry of terror issued from across the darting flames
The anten nae on Mernoqs head told him the directions from which the cry had come
Rapidly he and his compan ions circled the fire pit and raced into the corridor from which the cry had issued
Other Earthmen were excit edly milling about inside
In the center of the throng they came upon ghastly scene
Seven Earthmen lay dead mutilated their space suits crushed and ripped
The bodies had been torn to shreds
For moment in the horror of the situation no one saw the large boxes whose ends flanked the passage
They lay on shelves
Uljoph was first to discover them
He climbed over the side of one and looked down into the metal container
His mind ejaculated one thought
Empty Meanwhile others were examining more of the strange boxes
Reods warning came too late for long tentacle slid up over the side of container sharp metal claws embrac THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS ing an inquisitive and unsuspecting Earthman
Zougmre wriggled to free himself
monstrous body surmount ed by hideous head lifted up and more tentacles waved wildly menac ingly as the creature glared baleful ly at the surrounding Earthmen
Six snaky arms writhed from the black repulsive body protected by an artificial shell of metal
The tentacle ends were tipped with metal sharp ened to razoredged cutting power
head with an eye in front and an eye in back of the oval cranium turned from side to side
The eyes stared intently exuding cold crafty expression of intelligence
blunt snout sniffed inquisitively
Several of the nearer Earthmen sprang to the aid of their stricken comrade but it was too late
Three more tentacles curled themselves around the doomed man cutting his body to pieces
Get out of here quick urged Mernoq
We are powerless to com bat them Down the corridors ambled five of the insidious creatures
More of them were emerging from the metal containers
The Earthmen raced to the comparative safety of the fire cavern
What are they The invaders exclaimed Mernoq
The things that conquered the Solar System ages ago
We thought them all dead Impossible deplored Reod
How could they have lived Suspended animation replied Mernoq whose astute mind had con ceived the truth of the situation
When we opened that door it re leased forces automatically which were necessary to bring them out of their sleep
Air machines were set to working too
There is air down here now lfiERNOQ pointed to the leaping flames which seethed outward from the pit the bluegreen lumin osity changing in color as it yielded to red and white heat
tremendous wave of hot air sent them scurrying backward making them aware of its warmth even throughtheir space suits
We are weaponless against them cried Uljoph
Mernoq realized this fact keenly
The space invaders were not only ar mored but doubtlessly possessed weapons too
Mernoq hurriedly led the way around the fire pit and into that black section of the cavern which lay ahead
He was hoping against hope
They must go that way and hope for continuance of the tunnel
To return the way they had come would ultimately mean finding them selves trapped
These thoughts flew swiftly among them
What of the twenty men we left with the energy broadcaster Uljoph suggested
Suppose they attack in that direction The tunnel rises that way
The air will die out in the upper levels But if their air machines generate more air The ominous question remained un ansvered as the Earthmen set out on run past the fire pit the increased heat of the flames driving them far to one side near the vall
Mernoqs apprehensions grew less as he saw ahead of them the continuation of the tunnel
He had begun to fear that the cavern marked the tunnels end
The Earthmen became weary after mile or more of rapid running
It was the desire of Mernoq to put goodly amount of distance between them and the hateful creatures of the fire cavern
The latter had suspend ed themselves in living death to bridge the ages with their menace
CHAPTER IV Subterranean Battle the satisfaction of the Earth men the tunnel struck steep in cline much steeper than the one they had recently descended on leaving the kletin storerooms
In some places steps had been cut because of the ten dency toward perpendicular ascent
The climb was long one
Soon they found that the air manufactured be low them was dying out
They were once more in the usual vacuum
The THRILLING WONDER STORIES lower levels had been left behind
They came to long flight of steps up which they climbed to find them selves in another large cavern
All around them lay water
They were on an island in subterranean lake
Their bright lights revealed shore lit tle more than hundred yards away
The island lay in nearly the exact center of the lake several hundred feet from shore
It bore evidences of having been purposely constructed
The water or fluid of the lake which was closely akin to water took on peculiar appearance to the eyes of the Earthmen
It appeared dull and with out lustre
This was due largely to lack of atmosphere
How can we cross queried Ul joph
We can hardly swim with our space suits If the water is not too deep cr the bottom is not full of holes we can walk across If we could but drain the lake down through the passage why Reods original idea vas lost in brilliant burst of inspiration
His sudden enthusiasm was shared by the rest
Drain the lake into the internal fires
Kill the monsters For moment Mernoq felt himself overwhelmed by the possibilities of the daring plan
In his minds eye he saw the waters of the lake rushing down the long tunnel filling the low er level and cascading into the molten pit of fire
There would be boiling chaos clouds of steam the long dor mant invaders scalded to death
His indecision was short
Cut channel The Earthmen set to work vith will rapidly cutting ditch from the lake to the orifice of the tunnel in the islands center
Luckily they pos sessed the rock picks which made up an essential part of their space suit equipment
Rapid headway was made for the rock was soft type peculiar to Venus
large group started working from the tunnel entrance while others worked up to their heads in water at the lakes edge their globed helmets rising out of the water only to disappear again
Mernoq sent one of his men to gauge the depth of the lake
The man walked out of sight the water swirling above his head
From time to time he radiated reports to his comrades above
His space helmet finally broke the surface of the water near the farther shore where their lights had revealed con tinuance of the tunnel
The lake was comparatively shallow
We can all walk across said Mernoq
When this water starts draining into the lower levels we must hurry warned Reod
Steam will be forced back this way What of those we left in the cham ber of the broadcaster Uljoph in quired
If the steam rises they will die too The steam will seek the nearest and easiest exit said Mernoq
Be sides remember the heavy stone blocking the entrance to the secret tunnel
It will resist tremendous steam pressure NE of the Earthmen made star fling discovery
Air is blow ing up the shaft
It is rising into this cavern It was true
strong current of air blew up the tunnel bringing thin veil of dust with it
Mernoq feared the coming of the interstellar invad ers
More atmosphere was being gen erated from the corridors leading off from the fire cavern
We must hurry Only thin slice of rock separated the two channels which were nearly converged
The Earthmen chopped madly with their picks
They had worked frantically in shifts only fraction of their number being able to work unhampered in the ditch
scout Mernoq had sent down the tun nel now returned
They are coming
They have weapons trickle of water burst over the lip of the tunnel leading from the island to the lower levels
The alarm spurred the laboring Earthmen to des perate measures in superhuman ef fort to send the lake rushing down the tunnel before their ancient ene THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS mies could emerge
Upon the rising current of air came deathly cry which the radiophone ears of the space helmets readily picked up
It was eerie and chilling like no sound the Earthmen had ever before heard
One of the terrible things they had unwittingly revived strode into view below them on short squat legs
In several of his long tentacles he car ried gleaming discs
The Earthmen stood at the top of the shaft with upraised picks the only weapons they possessed
These were crude indeed compared to the destructive weapons which Aamon had carried away on the space ship
Two of the pale disc beams fell on the nearer of the Earthmen focusing for but brief moment
round por tion of each space suit glowed red then disappeared
Underneath the flesh of the Earthmen shone ruddy hue iridescent sparks shedding themselves rapidlly
The unfortunate men fell dead while the discs of fire continued to burn completely through their bodies
The disc beams flicked upon others of the band
One of them staggered toward the water
Another sank to his knees beside the tunnel
Back he cried
With all four arms he brushed and struck madly at the glowing spot which ate through his space suit
Dont let them He rose suddenly and jumped down upon the advancing monster in des pairing leap as he felt the death ray eating swiftly into his vitals
His impetuous leap hurled back the inter stellar invader upon four or five more who came crowding up from behind
For moment all was confusion in the tunnel
Metaltipped tentacles hastened the death of the martyred man who had used his rapidly expir ing body to the greatest advantage
Extricating themselves from the tangle of bodies and tentacles the ter rible creatures of the fire pit scuffled up the shaft their disc rays waving wildly
deluge of rushing water met them hurling them backward
One survivor clung with his tentacles to the lip of the tunnel opening
With mighty strength he pulled himself out of the strong current
Fully hun dred picks hacked his tentacles as all four arms of the nearer Earthmen rose and fell
The dismembered body de void of anything with which to cling yielded to the strong pull of the cur rent
The shrieking head with its hateful venomous eyes disappeared beneath the cascading water the hor rid screeching muffled to frantic gurgle
or moment the Earthmen seemed rooted to the spot
Sev eral of their number lay dead victims of the disc beams
Yet the Earthmen had triumphed
Reod shook his head ruefully
fear for those we left in the chamber of the energy broadcaster We must get back to where the space ship landed said Mernoq
Then we shall learn if they are safe Directions were quickly found and they headed for the distant monolith which lay broken and wrecked be cause of the treacherous attempt Aamon had made to send them all into eternity
Even now unsuspecting hu manity upon the Earth prepared for further contingents of the exodus while Aamon was laying his plans
The thought urged Mernoq to great er haste
He had plan in mind
It was not long before the jagged remnants of the great monolith be came visible upon the horizon
The Earthmen hurried to the spot
Where the entrance to the subterranean chambers had been located was now but tumbled mass of rock
Mernoq sent out call to those they had left imprisoned in the kletin chambers with the energy broadcaster
It was answered
Their comrades were alive and the mechanism was functioning perfectly
How are we to communicate with Earth and warn them of Aamons treachery queried Reod
We have no equipment Do you realize what type of ex plosive Aamon employed in destroy ing the monolith Why yes
The explosive was an nite
recognized it when heard the blast THRILLING WONDER STORIES The mind of Mernoq still remained reservedly inscrutable
Annite he continued is queer explosive What do you mean Its destructive forces are tremen dous yet it has peculiar fault when exploded in space or upon planet which has no atmosphere Why yes fragments of it are gen erally blown off it and fail to ex plode Exactly
Mostly through lack of barometric pressure And what good will that do us asked Uljoph
In one of these large rocks we are going to hollow out crude form of rocket gun Mernoq explained
We shall charge it with the fragments of unexploded annite which is strewn about here on the ground In brief flash they recognized Mernoqs purpose
They were going to rocket warning to the Earth hop ing it would reach there in time to prevent the cataclysm which Aamon had planned
CHAPTER Rocket Messages REPARATIONS were hastily made
With their picks the Earthmen commenced fashioning rocket gun in the side of huge slab which faced away at the desired angle Mernoq wanted
For the construc tion of the rocket itself Mernoq searched among the ruins at the monoliths base for metal stanchions which had previously been built into the entranceway
It was here that he made discovery which he considered fortunate
There is sufficient metal to build three rockets for dispatch to Earth if we can gather annite to power all three Can we send message without its destruction when the rocket crashes against Earth Arrange parachutes to be released when the rockets hit Earths atmos phere suggested Uljoph
Or we may be able to fix reverse annite charges in various positions so that the increasing friction with Earths atmosphere will explode them and slow up the rockets speed By searching large part of the vi cinity where the explosion of annite had occurred the Earthmen gathered enough fragments to send off and equip with reverse charges all three of the rockets
Mernoq and his sub ordinate officers figured the mathe matical position of the two planets and their movements quite carefully also estimating the force of the an nite
The rockets would hit their target
It is long chance these rockets Uljoph said grimly
What if none of them are found or suppose they land in an ocean where tjfiey cannot be recovered In that case said Mernoq it will mean the destruction of Earths at mosphere and all human beings now on the planet You think that Aamon has done his work and departed for Zyse He has had time for it
Our only chance is to get word to them in time to charge the atmosphere with coun teracting gas One of Earths telescopes may dis cover our plight here suggested Reod
Space ships may be sent have been thinking the same said Mernoq yet it is probable that Aamon has ready story to tell es pecially in regard to the demolished monolith Each of the Earthmen measured THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS the possibilities and hoped the gages at the observatories on the Earth picked up the proximity and compo sition of all foreign objects entering Earths atmosphere
Some of the rockets would be traced and found
The question of timely arrival how ever vas uppermost in their minds
In spite of the terrific power and ac celerating impetus afforded by annite it would be long time before the projectiles reached Earth
Mernoqs order the Earthmen set off the first rocket
At long intervals the other two were sent into space
Off they hurtled in the direc tion of the greenglowing planet which glowed steadily in the sky
Earth and Venus were nearly in line and the suns position favored the Sight of the rockets
Time must pass time which battled with the time Aamon had set for the destruction of civilization
The rockets not only contained messages relating to Aamons perfidy but they also gave specific directions for charging the atmosphere
It was at Reods suggestion that an other chance of salvation was made possible
Mernoq employed this at once
On sloping wall facing the nlanet Earth messages were written in gigantic characters on the chance that Earth telescopes might be trained that way
Time dragged for the waiting Earthmen
close watch was kept upon the green star for the Earthmen were fearful of the telltale flash sur rounding the planet which would tell of Aamons success
The Earthmen knew that it would be long time before the stellar mes sages reached Earth great number of times longer than passage by space ship
Only few days had passed when one of the Earthmen issued mental cry of excitement which brought the general focus of attention immedi ately upon the green glowing planet vhich swung far off in space
Mer noqs heart chilled with fear
Had the gigantic cataclysm been unloosed at last
His keen eyes searched for the telltale glare of destruction
Instead he saw several bright specks growing larger in the sky
They expanded to view as they came and he saw that they were space ships
Five in number they cruised about the vicinity of the wrecked monolith finally settling to rest
The stranded Earthmen watched in undecided an ticipation
Was this help arriving or had Aamon returned to finish the sinister work which had narrowly failed him the first time
Several figures stepped from the nearest ship and approached them
Mernoq with gladness in his heart recognized one of them as Eloow
Earths atmosphere cried Mer noq voicing the apprehension upper most in his mind
Is it saved We do not yet know for certain but we hope for the best How did you get here so soon
We sent rockets but that was but few days ago We read your cliff message from our space ship said Eloow
We were already on our way here But Aamon where is he On his way to Zyse but it is small start he has
We left for Ve nus secretly almost at the starting moment of Aamons ship in the direc tion of Sirius
His course of flight has diverged only at slight angle from our own
was suspicious of him when he told how the monolith had been destroyed in blasting nec essary passage into the kletin cham bers
He reported that you and the others not returned with him had de cided to stay and move the kletin out upon the surface of Venus before more ships were sent for it fTHEN were these ships to wW come for us Mernoq asked
Sixteen Earthly days hence When Aamons destruction of Earths ai
was consummated and he was safely on his way out of the Solar System observed Mernoq
And you were found entombed and dead added Eloow
When our tele scope picked up the inscriptions you made on the cliff dispatched one of our ships back to Earth to take pre THRILLING WONDER STORIES yentative measures against Aamons reachery The formula for charging the air Mernoq interrogated eagerly
The formula so long preserved and which is entrusted to but ievf of us you Aamon and myself included
The same formula which our ancient an cestors used in keeping the exploding emanations from Venus atmosphere harmless when they struck the atmos phere of Earth Then our fears are at rest for Aamon would not have timed the ex plosion to occur before he had left the Solar System and you say that he has but short start That is so Aamon must never reach Zyse Mernoq avovied
It is unlikely that he shall re plied Eloow
have suspected him ior long time
never placed the trust and confidence in him that you did
On one reason or another held up most of the ships which were to leave with Aamon but could not manage to delay Aamon himself
did the next best thing
placed man aboard with orders to hamper the speed of his ship in case we wished to catch up Let us give chase at once Mernoq hurried with Eloow to his ship
Four ships rose from the cold dead surface of airless Venus and raced off into space
The remaining ship stayed while its occupants set to work releasing the score of impris oned Earthmen attending the energy radiator
The course of Aamons ship had led sunvard designed on straight course to Sirius which would cut close to the orbit of Mercury
Earthmen eagerly scanned the proximity detec tors as high speed was attained
The four ships spread out so that they cruised several thousand miles apart
They were nearing Mercurys orbit when the sunward ship of the group first picked up the location of Aamons slowermoving space ship
The four pursuing ships gradually converged
message was radiated for Aamon to stop
His answer was vicious blast of power which nar rowly missed the nearest ship of Eloows fleet
Aamon put on sudden spurt of speed
It was evident that Eloows minion who had been responsible for the slowing up of Aamons ship had been detected
That his end had been swift one neither Eloow nor Mer noq doubted
The four ships kept abreast of Aamons at safe distance
Another blaze of power went wide of its mark
Still another and much closer charge caused one of the pur suing ships to tumble crazily in space until it once more righted itself
Shall we fire asked Eloow turn ing to Mernoq
Mernoq nodded grimly
The order was communicated to all four ships
Simultaneously blasts leaped out at the fleeing craft
Two of them struck
They waited to see the extent of the damage
AMONS ship demolished at one end rolled awkwardly off its course still hurtling at meteoric speed
Mernoq and Eloow watched the proximity detectors
series of blasts from the spacewrecked craft lashed savagely and spitefully at its avengers
They were ineffectual yet revealed dangerous potentials which were still Aamons
Another barrage will finish him Mernoq halted in the act of issuing instructions as Eloow gripped his arm and pointed significantly at the proximity detector
Aamon has lost his propulsion power
He is falling into the sun
What end could be more fitting
We have only to stand by at safe dis tance and watch him go to well merited death Mernoq revised his orders to fire
Instead his ships formed funeral consort about the doomed and help less ship of his archenemy whom once he had trusted and encouraged
They cruised too far distant for Aamon to vent any further spite upon them although he made several vain attempts
Nearer and nearer the great flaming globe of the sun they raced the initial momentum of Aamons ship at the time he had been THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS struck swervingly diverted tovvard the suns incandescent mass
He had no power to change the course
The end was inexorable
So fast were the five ships moving through space that soon the ships of the fleet commenced to feel the tre mendous drag of the suns immense attraction
Aamons fall was accel erating
He and his faithless crew were consigned to flaming hell which would consume them long be fore they ever reached it
They were to die horrible linger ing death of suffocating heat watch ing tormented ly the sunward side of their space ship grow red then vhite hot before they perished miserably
Something of this inevitable doom must have impressed itself on Aamon for in the middle of the funeral cor tege the cosmic coffin with its living and doomed cargo burst suddenly into bright flash of light
Where slowmoving dot had rest ed on the proximity detectors there were now but few tiny specks slow ly radiating from central point
Aamon had chosen the easier way
No longer did he stand as menace to mankinds peace and security in the exodus to the new world

MILLION YEARS AHEAD Ross Sherilis Superman of Future Eons Knows but One Master Evolution
By EDMOND HAMILTON Author of The Comet Doom The Ac cursed Galaxy etc
he little ratfaced man looked fearfully at the mechanism in the corner of the lamplit labo ratory
It was like tall cylindrical cage of metal bars connected elec trically to the generators huge vacuum tubes and other apparatus in the room
He turned jerkily toward the other two people in the room
One was serious lanky young man the other girl whose soft face was pale and whose dark eyes held hooded appre hension
These two were Ross Sherill brilliant young biologist and his wife Gail
The ratlike little man asked fear fully Is that the machine
The thing youre going to use to to change me Thats it Fraham said Ross She rill steadily
The projector that is going to throw you million years ahead of the rest of the human race in evolutionary development His serious eyes kindled with scientific enthusiasm as he addressed the wizened little Fraham Evolution is ordinarily very slow process he went on physical and mental change which recently dis Do you think want to be halfape MILLION YEARS AHEAD Severed is caused by certain kinds of cosmic radiation that effect slight changes in our bodies forcing our race ever higher on the road of prog ress
Ive found out how to produce those forces artificially many times stronger
So when turn those vastly intensified forces on your body you will in few minutes pass through evolutionary changes that will take million years for the rest of the race to pass through naturally Yes but whatll change into cried Fraham
Suppose change into something awful what then Once Ive thrown you ahead in de velopment and observed what the human race will evolve into can bring you back to your present status Sherill told him calmly
found certain cosmic radiation that reverses evolutionary change and Ill use that on you The lanky young scientist took packet of bills from his pocket
Heres the thousand dollars agreed to give you for submitting to the experiment
Youll get it when were done raham stiffened at sight of the money and an ugly gleam came into his slitted eyes
might add that youll get the money only by undergoing the experi ment Sherill added pleasantly
have pistol in my pocket and if you try anTthing Ill shoot
Well what about it are you willing to undergo the experiment Frahams face was beaded with perspiration and his eyes rolled from the money to the bulky enigmatic mechanism
He finally spoke hoarsely
Ive got to do it and you know it you know the police are hot after me and that need that grand to get out of the country
But remember he added desperately you promised to bring me back so Ill be just like am now will youll be out of here in an hour Ross Sherill told him eagerly
Step inside the projector As Fraham slowly obeyed entering the cylindrical cage with steps weighted by dread Gail Sherill laid trembling hand on her husbands arm
Her dark eyes held fear
Ross she said Im afraid of this experiment
wish youd give it up Dont bother me now dear please the tense young scientist begged
He was turning switches shifting controls
The generators around the room broke into humming life the great tubes silently lit to violet glow transformers sprayed crack ling brush
Sherill his hand on the final switch regarded the terrified little man inside the projector
Just stand steady Fraham he said
It will take only fifteen min utes of exposure to the force He flung the svitch
Brilliant white light broke from the vertical bars of the projector blinding cascade of radiation that hid from sight the trembling man inside
The evolution accelerating force was playing upon that mans body millions of times more powerful than such forces had ever played upon human being be fore
Ross Sherill watched tensely his hand on the switch
Behind him Gail watched too her slim figure rigid with fear of the unknown
What was going on inside that glowdng halo
What tremendous changes were taking place in Fraham as the awful cosmic forces flung him through thousands of years of future develop ment each minute
It was ghastly unholy the fear ridden girl told herself this artificial shortcut on the road of slow evolu tion
Her husband was violating the basic laws of the universe itself in thus hurling human being million years past his fellows in development
Why had she ever let him do it
Sherill counted the minutes be neath his breath
Fourteen fifteen He threw the switch open
The blinding glow of radiation died and they stared petrified at the man inside the cylindrical cage
The wizened ratfaced little criminal had vanished and in his place stood man of superhuman terrible aspect
His huge form was bursting from Frahams clothes
For this man was THRILLING WONDER STORIES almost seven feet tall with colossal shoulders tapering down into lean perfect body of tremendous strength
body that was as much superior to the ordinary human form as man is to the ape
But the face
It was godlike in terrible beauty the features perfectly regular the mouth straight merci less line the eyes enormous glowing ones through which looked cold vast mind whose shock was felt tangibly
The head was quite hairless
My God cried Ross Sherill star ing in amazement at this superhuman figure
Fraham changed Ross change him back cried Gail clutching her husbands arm in terror
Im afraid Too late for that
Fraham or the godlike man who had been Fraham was stepping out of the projector
His glowing eyes fastened on Sherill and the dazed young scientist felt those eyes reading the depths of his mind like an open book
That inhuman gaze swung to Gails pale face and she flinched in horror from it
hen the transformed Frahams coldly beautiful face turned back to Sherill
He spoke in an icy level voice
To think it was you savage semi animal who developed me
Fraham said Ross Sherill hoarsely
You did change into the kind of man all men will be in mil lion years He went on with desperate hope
All right now that Ive seen what the course of future evolution will bring forth
Ill bring you back to your former state
Step back into the projector The creature before them laughed
cold terrifying and mirthless laughter
You amuse me he told Sherill
Do you think that would let you change me back now into what was into dimminded shriveled halfape like yourself
No stay as am
and with my brain can bring all your witless race under my rule easily Ross Gail cried desperately to her husband hell do it if you let him stay like this
You must change hinJ back Ross Sherill suddenly produced the pistol in his pocket and levelled it at the godlike Frahams heart
Back into the projector Fraham or Ill shoot he cried
dont in tend to let my experiment release superminded monster on the world The superman before him laughed again
You think to match wills with me
Throw that weapon out of tha window His glowing eyes were riveted on Ross Sherills as he uttered the com mand
As those supernal eyes bored into his soul the young biologist felt himself losing control of his own body
He tried to pull the trigger and couldnt
His muscles were obeying not his own mind but the hypnotic command of the creature before him
Resistless his hand went up and flung the pistol out of the open window
Fraham went on contemptuously in that eerie cold voice
You begin to see how helpless you are to resist me
Just as helpless will all men be when appear in their cities and order them to submit to ray rule His glowing eyes flashed
may have to destroy many of them before they learn my power
But it will be easy
My mind can devise weapons against which your race will be powerless to resist
will build the first of those weapons now As Sherill and his wife watched the superman moved swiftly about the laboratory picking up some ebonite rods two copper discs small piece of bismuth and other odd objects
They saw the transformed Fraham deftly quickly join these things to gether into tripodlike instrument crowned by the two discs
Ross Sherill realized in horror that it was some awful weapon of the future de signed to be used upon present day humanity
The lanky young scientist crouched leaped for Fra hams throat
Fraham whirled and the hypnotic MILLION YEARS AHEAD command of those terrible eyes froze Sherill halfway across the room
You will remain in this room you two commanded the superman while test my new weapon outside
can use you as subjects to test other weapons upon Without another look at them he strode out of the room with his curious weapon
Looking numbly out through tha window into the moon light they could see his huge figure striding up the slope of the hill be hind the old country house
They saw him stop up there on the crest where he seemed to be setting up and adjusting the tripodlike thing
Ross Sherill threw himself toward the door
Ill get the pistol threw outside he cried to his wife
That monsters got to be killed at once or hell de stroy the world He reached the door and stopped
He could go no further his muscles were obeying the hypnotic command of the superhuman Fraham and not his own will
Sherill concentrated strongly but could not get through that door
Neither could Gail when she tried
Ross we cant get out she sobbed
We Weve got to cried the young scientist wildly
If we dont
Ill be responsible for the havoc that crea ture will wreak on Earth Then he pointed through the window and cried Look hes trying that devilish weapon now Up there on the crest of the moon lit hill they could see the huge figure of the superhuman Fraham bending over his tripod instrument
They glimpsed swift terrific flash of white fire or force that drove out into the moonlight from the thing
They saw the monstrous superman straighten and peer into the silver night as though to see the effect of that tremendous bolt as it struck somewhere far away
ffWE cant stop him Gail was exclaiming her eyes wide with dazing horror
Were like children against brain like that un able to oppose our minds for minute against his Like bomb exploding in his brain an idea burst blindingly upon Ross Sherill
We cant oppose his mind now no he cried but what if throw myself forward million years in de velopment with the projector also
Then Id have mind as vast and powerful as his could fight him He leaped instantly toward the cylindrical cage
Im going to do it Gail
It will only take fifteen minutes for the force to throw me ahead and dont think hell return before then Gail clung to his arm crying
No Ross dont she pleaded
Youll become monster like him wont Sherill told her des perately
Fraham was of predatory criminal cast of mind and that is why even after he had developed so tre mendously he still had in mind only the desire to dominate and prey on the world
But want only to destroy the nienace of Fraham and when Ive done so Ill reenter the projector and you can use the reversing force to bring me back Before the terrified girl could pro test further he had entered the mechanism
Throw the switch Gail he com manded urgently
Theres little time The girls hand numbly closed the switch
Inside the cage of bars Ross Sherill was almost blinded by the terrific burst of glowing force from about him
As that awful flood of tingling force saturated every atom in him he felt hurled through abysses incredible fathomless and staggering
He felt his mind and body changing expanding unfolding with each pass ing minute
Vast new vistas of thought opened out in his mind things that had be fore seemed complex and obscure became crystal clear to him
He felt superhuman enhancement of his powers of reason
He knew he could solve problems in moment that wculd take an ordinary man months or years
And as his body changed THRILLING WONDER STORIES and grew he felt boundless physical vigor he had never felt before
His emotions were withering and dwindling and cold logic was now dominant in his mind
He was be coming he knew the kind of man all men would become in million years
And it seemed to him now that in changing from his former cramped body and mind he was stepping from an animal state into one of full hu manity
The glow of force died about him as the switch was opened and he could look out now into the laboratory
Before him staring wildly at him was girl
He felt repulsion at sight of her
This savage semiape female thing so undeveloped of mind and body had he really loved this
His new mind sickened at the thought
She was running toward him cry ing Ross Then she stopped and he saw horror and fear deepen in her eyes as she met his own gaze
Youre not Ross at all she whis pered
Youve changed like Fraham
Im afraid of you She was shrinking back from him in dread
But he paid no attention to her as he strode out of the cage
Fraham the other
The enemy whom he must destroy
His supersensitive ears could already hear Fraham coming down the hill returning to the house
But he did not fear the other now he knev with cold confidence that he was his match
The haggard wildeyed girl also heard now and cried warning
Ross hes coming
Go out and get the pistol if you can Be silent he ordered her
As her eyes met his commanding gaze she was mute and stricken
In his new mind Sherill felt only con tempt for her ignorant babbling
As though he needed primitive toy like that pistol
Fraham stepped into the door huge figure as tall and superhuman as himself
And Frahams gloving eyes saw him and realized in an instant what had happened
You youve changed too he cried
Well well see whos master He swung up the deadly tripodal weapon he carried
The woman screamed
Drop that weapon Ross ordered calmly
IS eyes were meeting Frahams glowing gaze beating against glowing gaze contest of two super minds more deadly than the clash of swords
Fraham was still raising his weapon but more slowly now
Slower and slower his hands moved as upon his brain beat the superhypnotic command to desist
Then Frahams hands stopped stiffly holding the tripod
He was putting every bit of his own brains colossal power into the hypnotic gaze with which he was battling the com manding eyes of the transformed Ross Sherill
The two supermen stood silent in the room that was utterly still except for the spasmodic sobs of the crouch ing girl
They were engaged in ter rific battle of minds such as Earth had never held before
Then almost imperceptibly the ter rible eyes of Fraham wavered the merest trifle
His mind before it had been projected million years ahead in development had been inferior to the scientists
And now that Sherills development also had been jumped forward ten thousand centuries his mind was still inferior was slowly breaking down before the scientists will
Slowly the hands of Fraham low ered
In his eyes was an awful agony of searing hate and fury
Yet he could not keep his mental defenses from crumbling before the others assault
Drop the weapon repeated Ross Sherill coldly his godlike face un changed in calm Frahams fingers relaxed and the diabolical tripodweapon rattled to the floor
Step into the projector ordered the transformed scientist his gaze never flickering
As he understood the meaning of that command Frahams eyes became terrible
Hellfires of furious revolt MILLION YEARS AHEAD flamed in them surge of terrific mental resistance
But Sherills commanding gaze held steady beating the other down again with hypnotic command
hoarse strangled sound bursting from his lips the huge figure of Fraham moved stiffly across the laboratory and into the tall cage of the projector
Sherill still holding the other with his eyes followed
His hand found the switch of the evolution reversing force and snapped it shut
Blue radia tion burgeoned from the bars wrap ping Frahams great form in shroud of azure light
Ross Sherill watched immobile as the projector hummed for minute after minute
The crouching girl was staring stunned at the cold awesome beauty of his inhuman face
Then Sherill flung open the switch
The blue force ceased
And there in the projector stood Fraham not the transformed mighty superman but the wizened ratfaced little criminal
He staggered out dazedly wildly
he faltered and sank into dead faint on the floor
Sherill felt touch on his sleeve
It was the girl that savage atavistic female thing looking up into his face
Ross you conquered him you brought him back and kept him from destroying the world she cried
Now enter the projector yourself
Let me bring you back to the man you were my husband Bring him back
Drag him back across million years of development to become semiape like herself to become again cramped of mind and body an unclean primitive animal
No every thought in Sherills brain revolted at the idea
He wouldnt give up this tremendous power of brain and body this supermanhood hed attained
He couldnt
The girl seemed to read his thoughts
You promised Ross she pleaded
He shook her off coldly
What had he to do with this savage creature
Outside lay world that only his great brain could put in order world waiting for him to be its master
here was much for him to do in that world race to be forced into new cleaner ways of living war and greed and trickery to be stamped out
He could do all that Ross Somehow that cry of heartbreak made him stop at the door
Something in his inmost fibers something still strangely bound to this savage crea ture was stopped and held by it
Ross its Gail Gail she was cry ing to him
You must enter the pro jector for me His relentlessly clear mind told him that this woman was seeking to drag him back into state of savagery like her own to take away forever his wonderful mind and body
Yet something deep within him something not to be controlled even by all his tremendous mental power made him move slow step by step to ward the cylindrical cage
At its very edge he hesitated feeling stronger than ever that sick repulsion at the thought of returning to halfanimal state
Please Ross He stepped very slowly inside the cage of bars
With choking sob the girl threw shut the switch
When the blue reversing force stopped it was Ross Sherill not the transformed godlike figure of before but again the lanky young scientist who stepped out of the projector
He looked bewilderedly from the unconscious figure of Fraham on the floor to the girl who was running madly toward him
Ross youve come back she cried
Sherills face was aghast
Why remember now didnt want to come back to you Gail he said
You looked like an animal to me looked repulsive apelike He held her tight
God what an awful thing that pro jector almost released on the world he whispered
Im going to destroy it and never build another
Whatever power has decreed the slow rate of human evolution knows better than we men knows that if we tried to go too fast upon that evolutionary road we would only destroy ourselves ELIXIR of DOOM An Exciting Sensational Drama of the Little Worlds That No Man Can See

CHAPTER The Flower Box the fourth sector of the North Atlantic Airway the westbound night plane with mail and fifty passengers was in trouble
fuel leak had been discovered
Well drop down on Pontoon Four the chief pilot said
Wont delay us much Queer the radio man said cant get word out of Somers and Alden Pontoon lay glistening in the moonlight
little emergency land ing field fifty by hundred and fifty feet
metal raft raised on its pon toons alone here in the Atlantic
The moonlight gleamed on its flat metal expanse
At one end was small metal shed the supply house
At the other close against the lowrailed side of the raft stood the little cottage where the pontoonkeepers lived
There were two of them two young Amer icans Roy Somers and George Alden
The cottage was singlestory structure entirely of metal silver glistening alumite
This night of June th was calm
The sea was placid
The officers and passen gers of the distressed airliner gazed down at the somnolent empty pon toon
Its beacon lights were burning
The windows of the little cottage glowed with yellow illumination from within
But where were Roy Somers and George Alden
They should have an swered the radio call
Very queer the radio man said
There ought to be more than Somers and Alden here
Only an hour ago had message from the eastbound Inside Tiny Flower Box Somers and plane
It stopped here
Put off two passengers relatives of Alden An hour ago nothing had been wrong here
The Londonbound flyer had brought old Professor Alden and his daughter Anne from New York
They were George Aldens father and sister who were to spend few days on the pontoon visiting him
And the chief pilot of that other plane had re ported something else
Was it reptile from the prehistoric ages serpent hundreds of feet long
Shortly after leaving the pontoon passenger was found to be miss ing One Jose Toro who had come aboard at New York
He was booked through to London but evidently he had left the ship at the pontoon
Very strange
Five people unac counted for
The pilots searched the pontoon
They got their fuel from the storehouse
There was no sign of disorder
Nothing wrong
They searched the little metal cottage
Its door had smashed lock
Nothing else was wrong
The few small in terior rooms showed no signs of vio lence
The luggage of Professor Al den and his daughter stood as mute evidence that the guests had arrived
The officers of the mail plane re ported the condition of Pontoon by radio to New York and to London and in ten minutes they departed
Perilous Manhunt
THRILLING WONDER STORIES When they were gone Pontoon still lay silent and deserted
Drama had been here tragedy doubtless but it was over now
But was it
On the floor of the kitchen under the low southern win dow stood little flower box
It was box only foot wide two feet long and hardly six inches deep
Soil was in it
geranium flowered at its cen ter
It seemed to have been neglected
Was only recently watered
Nothing of tragedy and drama go ing on here now
No sign of life here on this deserted metal raft
Here in the flower box little sign of life showed an ant in one corner wan dered disconsolately over the dirt looking for food
But what of that
Anyone here now staring at the little flower box would have concluded that there was nothing to see
Fatuous reasoning
Who ever thinks of the amazing realms of small ness always under our eyes teeming always with drama and tragedy
This little flower box for in stance
hour and half before the dis tressed westbound flyer landed at Pontoon and found it deserted Roy Somers sat with George Alden in the kitchen of their metal house
Al den had just come from his radio in strument in the adjoining room
The eastbound plane is landing here Alden said
Roy what do you think father and Anne coming to spend day or two His face was flushed his dark eyes sparkled
The big blondhaired Somers was excited
Good Lord what news
Your father and Anne Somers could think only of Anne
Coming here now
Anne who through all the lonely days and nights was so constantly in his thoughts
In ten or fifteen minutes Alden said
What surprise
Get busy Roy got to get this place slicked up The plane from New York landed swiftly discharged Professor Alden and Anne and quickly departed
To Somers it was like dream having Anne here
He clung to her hands
smal slim darkhaired girl her face like his was flushed
Roy youre hurting my hands He released her hands in confu sion and turned to her father
Pro fessor Alden was small frail grey haired man in his sixties thin and wiry like his son George
Somers picked up the suitcases but there was one small satchel which the professor insisted on carrying himself
Ill tell you about it later he said
discovery of mine Anne began cooking supper
The professor and his son crossed the raft to inspect the supply house
Somers joined them
But after minute or two he wanted to be back with Anne
He left them unceremoniously re crossed the metal field in the moon light and approached the little metal cottage
The door was closed
He had left it open just few moments before
Then he was stricken by the sound of voice
Not Annes voice
And am here
want to be with you The voice of Jose Toro
Somers recognized its suave Spanish accent
He had met this Toro
young Latin American chemist who in New York was Professor Aldens assist ait
Somers had never liked him
For one thing he was far too attentive to Anne
But Jose thought you were on the plane going on to London But got off
There is some thing sudden jealousy had made Som ers pause by the door
There was small hallway inside beyond which was the kitchen
Anne and Toro evi dently were there
The voices were muffled by the closed metal door but still they were plainly audible
Jose The girl obviously was startled
Jose let me go Anne was almost screaming with terror
The house had several win dows all of which were open
Somers leaped for one of them
The heavy metal hurricane blind came snapping down in his face
And all the others slid closed simultaneously all of ELIXIR OF DOOM them electrically operated from switch inside the house
And there was Toros muffled voice Stop fighting you little fool
do not want to hurt you Back at the door Somers frantically pounded lunging against it but it resisted all his efforts
And the metal window blinds vere the same
The little house was impregnable
Mingled with Annes screams of protest again came Toros voice Adventure for you and me eh ninta
No one can catch us now To the raging Somers the voice seemed to have new quality
Behind Somers young Alden and the professor came dashing up breath less
That fellow Toro Somers gasped
Here inside here with Anne The voices inside were steadily grow ing fainter
Get crowbar George
Well break the door It seemed an eternity while they waited and Somers raged and plunged at the resisting door
Then within minute young Alden came rushing back with the heavy iron bar
The voices inside were very much dimmer now queerly far away in sound
But they could not escape from the sealed metal house
Somers thought that triumphantly as he seized the crowbar and bashed in the door lock with single blow
They rushed inside
It seemed to Somers that just then he heard Annes faint terrified cries
But the place was empty
Somers dashed through the rooms
Anne he called where are you He dashed from one little room to the other
Searching frantically The sealed house was empty
the kitchen the trembling Pro fessor Alden straightened from the floor
His small satchel was in his hand
He set it on the table
It was open
Somers saw rows of tiny metal vials some red some white
He has stolen some of my drugs my great discovery the professor said Somers and Alden stood gasping
Amazing diabolical plot of this Jose Toro
Amazing thing of sci ence this which now the professor was so vehemently telling
As the professors assistant Toro had helped for the past two years in the old mans chemical researches
Revolutionary research successfully ending with an amazing discovery
drug to shrink every tiny atom of the human body cells
To reduce in size every atom of any living organism
Uniform dwindling so that the shape the identity of the complex cell ag glomerations remained unchanged and only the bulk was altered
The professor gasped out his as tounding secret as with trembling fin gers he searched his satchel of vials
drug for reducing the mass of living organism
And drug which was its opposite to increase the mass increase the bulk
Incredible thing
Somers stood con fused
Yet it explained this disappearance of Anne and Toro
Incredible fantasy
Yet here it was
Somers mind tried to encompass it
Anne and the villainous Toro had been here but now they were gone
But theyre not gone Professor Alden was saying
Theyre right here of course
Gone from us in size but right here somewhere
Well have to take the drug
Make our selves small find them somewhere here The professors hands shook as he gripped his little vials Roy George thats what Anne and came to tell you
thought we might make an experiment here
Ive never yet tried this with human
Only with insects He held one of the red and one of the white vials
The red for dwin dling
We must hurry
Theyll be gone so far into smallness He suddenly checked himself
Somers saw an expression of horror sweep his face
On the floor there was sound of scratching
The rasp and scuttling of insect feet unnat urally loud
For an instant the three men stood chilled with horror
They saw the thing now an oblong black thing down on the floor of the room over THRILLING WONDER STORIES by the window
The bright light from the overhead electric bulb illumined it clearly
An ant six inches ong
It stood belligerent on its bent legs
The professors voice broke the tense silence
He Toro must have dropped pellet of the enlarging drug
This ant licking at it dont you realize It seemed to Somers that his heart stopped beating
The ant was visibly enlarging swifter always as though every moment its rate of growth was accelerating
Its multiple eyes glared
It reared erect
Kill it The old professor was terrified into panic of confusion
The thing eluded them
Long glis tening black shape pinched in the middle like an hourglass
It disap peared through the broken outer door out to the moonlit expanse of the pontoon
Roy my God Roy George Somers and young Alden leaped past the whitefaced old man
At the outer doorway all three paused
The professor gasped
Weve got to kill it
Cant let it swim away escape It will devas tate the vorld Out in the moonlight near the cen ter of the glistening metal landing field the hideous thing stood poised
Only an ant
Somers stood with cold horror clutching at his heart
The damnable thing was growing larger
What would its size in an hour be
Swimming the ocean reaching shore
monster with no limit to its growth perhaps
Again the ant reared itself erect
Its eyes glowed phosphorescent in the moonlight
And then it dropped horizontally
Belligerent with the realization of its size it came scut tling forward
CHAPTER II The Fight with the Ant Somers the brief terrifying combat was fantasy of horror
He was aware of the hideous thing advancing
Enormous insect now
It advanced lusting to seize these up right enemies who stood regarding it
Somers heard the professor give terrified cry and dart sideward
But young Alden jumped forward
The ant reared to meet him
They grappled and Alden toppled back ward fell with the ant down upon him
Somers reached for the heavy iron crowbar wdth which he had bashed in the cottage door
He seized it leaped forward just as young Alden fell
And Somers swung the iron bar
It struck the huge blackshelled body
There vas sickening mashing crack noisome stench of sticky white ooze
The back of the giant ant was broken its pinched middle sagged its whole mangled length writhed
With his senses reeling Somers stooped and jerked the fallen young Alden away
The insect lay writhing as tnough in death agony
Young Alden had rolled away and was climbing to his feet
Somers had dropped the iron bar
He turned and picked it up to strike again
Too late
Amazing strength of this ant strongest living thing of its size in all the vorld
It reared its mashed and mangled body
It seemed gigantically to leap with its broken legs
Somers head reeled he was barely aware of what was happening
He saw Professor Alden standing nearby the huge mangled insect leaping upon the old man seizing him bearing him away
Somers and young Alden all at once found themselves futilely despairing ly in pursuit
The giant ant held the old mans bodys aloft and with it scuttled and lurched across the moon lit metal surface
The professor screamed brief scream of agony
Somers flung the bar
It struck the ant mashed it again
Doubtless now the thing was dying or dead
But the momentum of its huge body and the blow of the bar slid it forward
The low guard rail of the pontoon was near at hand
The noisome gigantic mass of shell ELIXIR OF DOOM lOS Five hundred feet above Somers heaved the boulder down full at Toros head and puip still gripping its victim slid and crashed through the guard rail vanished over the edge
There was drop of thirty feet to the placid moonlit sea
silent interval of hor ror then one final splash
Tough George Somers mur mured
Hes done for
Weve for gotten Anne Got to do something They turned and ran
To Somers came the irrational thought that now in the kitchen they would seize this damnable Jose Toro
But sight of the empty room brought Somers to his senses
How could he seize Toro and rescue Anne
Yet they were here somewhere
Frantically he and Alden poked about the little room
But there was nothing to see and only silence responded to their fran tic calls
Silence and the tramp of their own footsteps the grind as they shifted chairs and tables and the faint lap of the calm ocean against the walls of the pontoon
sudden thought struck Somers which turned him cold with horror
He gripped his companion
My God George we cant do this
Well trample them if theyre here small under our feet They stood transfixed almost afraid THRILLING WONDER STORIES to move
Somers tried to reason what must have happened
This Jose Toro with his unwelcome attentions to Anne
Toro had known Professor Aldens secret of the drugs
Toro had left the plane hid den himself on the pontoon
Watch ing his chance he had got into the house stolen the drugs and the girl taken her into the realm of small ness
But where were they now
What part of the room
Alden was trem blingly opening the satchel of drugs
Two vials missing it looks like that he said
These others red and vhite father said the red ones for smallness didnt he Somers remembered it
Each seized two of the vials
Alden locked the satchel again
Somers opened his small red bottle
score of tiny red pellets were inside
But how many were they to take
hey could only guess
One per haps for normal shrinkage
They decided to take only one each at first
And add others later
But as they became small in which part of the kitchen would they search
Somers mind tried to en visage the coming experience and it set him gasping
Why to human tiny in size this kitchen would be ex panded into gigantic realm
One might run across the floor and be minutes reaching the opposite wall
Vhy if one were small enough it might be days journey
vast realm of smallness here with Toro and Anne wandering in it
Then Somers thought of something else
Toro must have dropped pel let of the enlarging drug
That ant had eaten some of it
The ant what was an ant doing in this metal kitchen on the metal pontoon in the middle of the Atlantic
The little flower box
Somers cried know where they may have gone Alden knelt with him on the floor beside the flower box The overhead light shone strong upon it
Look Roy
Look Alden murmured
Amazing sight
Down there on the caked dirt half hidden by the tiny fuzz of growth two little figures were plainly visible
Toro and Anne
He was carrying her inert body in his arms
Tiny human figures
quarter of an inch high no more
Toro carry ing Anne
Struggling laboriously through the growth of grass blades
Dwindling figures
Already they were smaller than moment before
The grass far taller than Toros head almost hid them
vague instinct made Somers reach down
But he checked himself Powerless
How could he seize that tiny human form no bigger than an ant
His descend ing hand suddenly seemed monstrous his thumb and forefinger were in capable of grasping the minute figures
Breathlessly he and Alden crouched stared down
Toros threading ad vance had moved the grass blades but now he was too small for that
He staggered with Annes body moving between the blades without touching them
Was Anne dead
Somers could not think so for the fleeing Toro then would have abandoned her
She had fainted probably
Then he knew that Anne was not dead
The drugs were effective on living organisms only and Annes body now was dwindling equally with her captors
Toro came out of the grass
So small
eighth of an inch high
Certainly no more than that
And it seemed that as Somers bent lower to look Toro was gazing up with waving arm in gesture of de fiance
Almost invisible now
Somers blinked
He heard Alden mutter Gone No
Still there Somers was al most sure he saw the tiny moving speck which was Toro and the pin point dot of Annes bluewhite dress
There was tiny ridged crack in the caked dirt smaller than one would make with the scratch of fingernail
It seemed that the moving specks had dropped into it vanished
Somers breathed again
And then he tensed
George he murmured give me match
dont dare look ELIXIR OF DOOM away
dont dare Somers continued to stare at the spot
His groping hand took the match from Alden
Then he bent lower and very carefully stuck the match up right into the dirt half or three quarters of an inch from where Anne had disappeared
Carefully he mem orized the direction
Two pellets
Would that dwindle them quickly enough
He stood with Alden both of them pale and tense
They held the pellets ready
Somers nodded to Alden and simultaneously they swallowed the drug
Somers instinctively closed his eyes
He was conscious of an instant sweetish queerly aromatic taste in his mouth
His senses reeled with dizzying swoop
CHAPTER III Descent into Smallness omers opened his eyes
The sense of swooping dizziness per sisted for moment and then clari fied into semblance of normality
He found Alden clinging to him
You all right Roy Yes
Only feel queer tingling sensation They were seated together on the kitchen floor with upraised knees and feet drawn close to their bodies
The little flower box was in front of them
To one side were the legs of the kitchen table with its level top above their heads
Suddenly they were con scious that the whole scene was in motion
The walls the ceiling everything in the kitchen seemed to be slowly shifting
queer steady crawling change
Slow at first like the hands of clock whose movement is barely perceptible
But the change was ob vious
EverTthing was expanding
And the movement was not only visual
They could feel it now
The floor was crawling outward under them
It drew their feet out so that their knees shifted down with tiny jerks
They had to hitch themselves into new positions to maintain bal ance
Amazing but after moment they found the physical strangeness pass ing
They stood up clinging together with the floor shifting under their feet pulling their feet apart so that every moment they had to take step inward
And the movement was ac celerating
weird change was taking place
The table legs were huge
The table top was higher than their heads
The flower box seemed to have doubled its size and it was no longer near them
Six feet away now and shifting crawling steadily further into the ex panding distance
Somers laughed grimly
Got to keep our wits not get rattled Yes
think wed better go over there They started walking
The sensa tion was strange but in moment they got used to it
Six feet to the flower box
They took few steps
But the box was drawing away
They ran
The wall of the box was at their shoulders when they reached it
shoulderhigh green fence
They scrambled up over it tumbled in heap onto the dirt
Somers saw some six feet away round white pole sticking up waisthigh
The match
Another few feet beyond it would be the place where Anne had gone
Mustnt go there yet Somers warned
Were too big
Might trample her For moment they stood with the waisthigh grass blades expanding around them
From the edge of the box there was drop of thirty or forty feet
The kitchen tabletop was monstrous plateau quarter of mile away and high in the sky
No the wide expanse of ceiling was still visible as blur above them an expanding fading blur
The electric light bulb up there was dis tant spot of white glare
How long they stood engrossed Somers did not realize
Then he swung about his heart pounded with alarm
The white matchstick was THRILLING WONDER STORIES great pole eighteen or twenty feet high
And it was thirty or forty feet away
Beyond it very distant over the huge grass fronds great tower ing shape was visible
Somers moved to where between the twentyfoot leaves of the grass he would see that towering shape clearly
crooked pillar of brown green towering up hundreds of feet to blurred mass of red
The geranium
lake of muddy water was at its bottom
Alden too was staring in amaze ment
And suddenly he was gripping Somers
Things moving
My God you see them The world of the flower box
Steadily with constant accelera tion it was opening up
And there were things alive here of course
With trembling hand Alden was pointing at the expanding tower of the gerani umstem
Things alive on it
They were too far away now to be distin guished clearly
But undoubtedly there were moving living beings
new world here
And in it time was lost size was lost
Size and distance always changing
Everything growing swiftly gigantic and mov ing away into newly created realms of distance
Then suddenly Somers became aware of the matchstick again
It was gleaming white column now
It towered two hundred feet into the bluewhite blur of sky
And it was at least four hundred feet away over the tumbled expanse of dirt and rock
Somers went cold
The column was receding so fast
Could they reach it
Somers ran with his companion floundering after him
Four hundred feet
He knew he had run that far but still the gigantic white column loomed ahead
Then panting almost winded they reached it ran around its huge curving side
This way Somers panted
To ward the geranium The geranium plant was only blur in the distance with gleaming radi ance shining upon the watery ex panse at its base
Somers headed to ward it
Another desperate run
Amazing realms of smallness miles of rocky cragstrewn waste ridged and pitted little gullies opening
They leaped over them
They stumbled fell picked themselves up and ran on
Roy wait cant Im all out of breath Somers stopped
Despair was in his heart
They had waited too long
They could never reach that crack
Alden came panting up
Take it easy
Weve got to keep together Weve got to reach that crack Alden smiled grimly
If were too small we can get larger you know
No need of all this running he added
Both realized that the tumbled area of rocky distance had lost its move ment
The drugs action had worn off
They peered into the half light
Rocks were strewn here now
Gi gantic green stalks rose into the sky behind them the grass blades
Mem ory came to Somers
This was the place where Toro had stood carrying Anne
Roy look off there Somers followed the gesture
mile or two away the rocky ground suddenly burst upward
An earth quake monstrous cataclysm
It shook them with the rocks shudder ing under their feet
distant up heaval
The ground rising as though by vast explosion
Yet it was slow upheaval
pushing upward
mountain of earth rising hundred or two hundred feet into the air and falling back into huge tumbled lit ter of broken rock
The roar of it came echoing from the distance queer crashing roar blurred and muffled
They stood gazing transfixed
The earth had been pushed upward by monster coming up from under ground
mile or two away but still they could see the gigantic shape
Was it reptile from the prehistoric ages monstrous serpent hundreds of feet long
They could see it slithering twist ing coiling itself then lengthening ELIXIR OF DOOM out moving away until in moment it had vanished
Whitefaced Somers turned to his companion
He tried to laugh
The tension of his taut nerves made him feel suddenly hysterical
George do you know what that vas My God no worm wriggling up through the loose dirt
worm in the flover box Astonishing aspects of size
Size to govern ones viewpoint of everything
That monster only miserable little worm
Why here in the vial of drugs in his pocket was his ability to get large again to change that distant fearsome monster back into harm less wriggling little worm
Somers felt into his pockets to make sure that the vials were safe
He re called the professors brief words con cerning his drugs an aura which they flung about the living organism they were altering an aura like magnet ic field so that his clothing and the small articles in his pockets were within its influence
Yes the vials were sate
He laughed grimly
Weve sure got to keep our wits George
This can be handled better than were do ing it They were planning to take some of the enlarging drug
And then they saw what was obviously the crack into vhich Anne and Toro had vanished
It showed now as yawning shadow across the landscape about quarter of mile away
Come on Somers said
Easier to walk there than to take any more of the drug They started
Somers was ponder ing what procedure Toro might have followed
One dose of the drug would have worn off now
Had Toro taken more
hey came to the crack
Stood awed
It was long broken gully
great ridge of upflung earth was here on the plateau of its upper brink
They stood on the tumbled summit gazing down
If they went down there Somers said dubiously suppose we ought to climb down The descent did not take them long
They stood presently on the guliy floor with the broken walls towering above them
The twilight was deep er here
The sky was ribbon of greyblue haze
Silent rocky desolation
Their low voices echoed with queer muffled quality
But where have they gone Al den was saying
Roy how can we ever find them There were plenty of rocky re cesses here where Toro might be hid ing
Somers took step then checked himself shuddering
Anne might be here at his feet tiny as an ant
His gaze swept the stonelittered gully floor
George whats that over there he said abruptly
little crumpled white thing ten or fifteen feet away
They went and picked it up
It was small square of white linen smelling faintly of perfume
In its corner was small embroidered Annes handkerchief
Had she dropped it here by accident or was it trail which she purposely had left for them to follow
They were here Somers said thats evident
believe Anne dropped it purposely
She may have marked this spot here for us to show that this is where they took the sec ond dose of the drug They consulted
Then each took second red pellet
The sensations were not so confusing this time
THRILLING WONDER STORIES Crawling shifting of the enlarging landscape
The handkerchief grew monstrous
great billowing mass of white fabric
Presently it was higher than their heads
The strands were like plaited rope
The billowing folds were ten feet high
Then twenty feet
Look here Alden was stooping
On the shift ing ground which every moment was growing rougher more broken there lay bent black wire
It was several feet long and rapidly enlarging
One of Annes hairpins
No mis taking it
The trail into smallness
Brave little Anne She had recovered from unconsciousness
She was alert now leaving trail for them to follow
And the deduction of another fact was easy
This monstrous hairpin in another moment it was longer than Somers body still was far smaller than normal compared to the gigantic crumpled mass of the handkerchief
Anne and Toro had dwindled here
They had taken the second dose of the drug
And they were not moving very far in space only in size
We must keep ourselves here Somers said until this dose is worn off
doubt if theyd take third one Again he envisioned the enormity of smallness
This was only two pel lets
With others one might go down and down into infinity
Every tiny widening crack here at his feet held new gigantic realms if one were small enough to penetrate them
Every tiny grain of rock in this vast valley held new universe of small ness
At last the drug again wore off
Somers and Alden stood regarding great tumbled white hill
thing indescribable
Billowing folds of shaggy white ropestrands woven into titanic fabric
It stood piled into huge mass fifty feet or so in height with spread of an acre or more
score of entrances to the dark recesses under it were near at hand
Cave mouth openings and in one place yawning oval ten feet high
Somers and Alden stood peering into the inner darkness
Was the trail lost
There had been no other sign from Anne
Were she and Toro mo tionless now
Hiding somewhere here
wonder Somers said
just wonder That cavern in there From the yawning opening ahead there came muffled scream
cry of protest
Annes voice
With Alden after him Somers dashed forward plunging into the blackness of the cavern
CHAPTER IV Combat of Size had seemed dark under the vast billowy folds of the handkerchief
But when he got inside Somers was at once aware of light
reflected sheen from the fabric itself and dim effulgence from the rocks
He had noticed it outside in the gully while ago glowing dim phosphor escence
Swiftly he and Alden dashed for ward their eyes rapidly becoming ac customed to the softer light
The scream was not repeated
Quiet Somers murmured
Got to locate them He had stopped and stood clutching Alden
They listened peering
glowing labyrinth here
Round ed shelflike recesses in dozen places of the cavern walls
And all of it plaited rope strands so coarse fab ric that they could have climbed its rounded slopes
No sound
Eerie phosphorescent darkness
Give me that Toros voice
The sound of scuffle
And then they saw Toro and Anne
Two figures seemingly of normal height
They were standing about fifty feet away on shelflike recess of the fabric wall some fifteen feet above the rocks
Toro in white shirt and dark trousers Anne in her pale blue dress
Both mudstained with clothes torn by the journey
They stood on the ledge struggling ELIXIR OF DOOM the man gripping her cuffing her
Give me that wont
Kill me if you like wont go any further They had not yet seen their pur suers
Anne quite evidently had seized vial of the drugs
He was trying to snatch it from her
The realization came to Somers as he and Alden dashed forward
He was aware that up there on the ledge Anne had jerked loose her arm and flung something away
The vial of diminishing drug
It hurtled through the air and fell to the rocky floor
Toro shouted an oath
And then he saw his oncoming enemies
Somers already had reached the slope which led to the ledge
He leaped upon the rough fabric climbing it
Toro seemed stricken with astonishment
He stood defiant thin dark face livid with rage
His hand darted into his trousers pocket
The vial of the enlarging drug
Fiendish triumph distorted his face as he swallowed pellet
And ab ruptly Somers saw that he was grov ing
slim Latin American
But al ready he was six feet tall
Alden was shouting After him
Kill him
Ill come with you
Dont let him escape with that drug In that second reason came to the stricken Somers
He fumbled in his pocket
The vial of enlarging drug
Take it quickly
Match this fellow in his growth
And he swung and shouted at Al den You stay here
Take care of Anne
No both of you get large not so dangerous but keep away from me
Ill fight him Somers crammed two pellets into bis mouth
sevenfoot Toro leer ing with the triumph of his growing bulk stood up there now
Then he turned jumped backward down an other slope and vanished
Somers head had reeled from the drug but almost at once the feeling passed
He was aware that the eerie phosphorescent scene was shrinking
The fabric of ceiling was coming down the walls closing in
These closing walls
It startled Somers into panic of confusion
He stood tense clinging to the slope of the fabric
But its surface was smoothing the spaces between the ropestrands were closing on his fin gers
He could feel the surface bend ing under his weight
And suddenly he slipped saved himself from falling by backward leap
He had thought it was drop of nearly ten feet but it seemed only two or three
He got his balance stood wavering
On the dwindling rockground across the cavern lay Anne with her brother holding her
Dwindling figures already they were no longer than Somers arm
HERE was blur of movement as Toro made rush through nar rowing sidepassage
Somers scram bled after him
The shrinking fabric wails scraped him as he wedged through
Panting he got outside turned and beheld the small tunnel way through which he had emerged
It was hardly big enough for his hand
Got you now He swung around as the figure of Toro leaped upon him
They grap pled
Somers mind was alert
Above everything he knew he must keep his wits
The shock of Toros weight made him stagger backvard
Purpose ly he went limp sagged and fell pull ing his adversary down upon him
And then with sudden lunge twist ed and brought himself uppermost
He found Toro perhaps foot larger than himself
Stronger un doubtedly
But both quite evidently had taken two of the pellets
It seemed that there was no relative change in Toros size
He and Somers were enlarging with equal rapidity
Somers found himself straddling Toros chest
The fellow was lunging squirming flailing with his fists
Around him Somers was aware of the dizzying swooping scene
All shrinking
Rocky walls of the val ley lowering and closing
And almost at his side was crumpled white handkerchief
He was gripping Toros throat and Toro with his breath shut off was choking his eyes bulging
But tire sight of the shrinking handkerchief set Somers shuddering
THRltLING WONDER STORIES It seemed with that instant glance that he saw the tiny figure of Alden carrying Anne trying to run
Realization swept Somers
At any instant his leg or the flailing legs of the prostrate Toro might mangle those tiny running figures
He cast Toro off
He leaped erect
Stooping he snatched Toro sideward
Barely in time
It seemed that the handker chief was almost under Somers feet
The double dosage of the drug had confused Somers so that he scarcely thought of combat with his human enemy
But Toro had lunged to his feet
He stood panting and then he jumped again upon Somers
They wrestled fought with wild scrambling blows
Somers felt the thud of Toros fist upon his head
Toros face was close as he panted can conquer the world with these drugs
dropped some of it but have plenty left You have to do for me first Som ers retorted
But his adversary was strong
He was bending Somers backward now his weight pressing his dark satur nine face leering with triumph
Somers felt himself backing against rocky wall
Incredible for beyond Toros shoulder there was another wall advancing
And Toro saw the danger
He mum bled with startled horror
His grip loosened he jerked away
Somers momentarily free recovered his bal ance
These closing walls
This was no valley in whicn they were fighting
No more than narrow rocky trench few feet wide and shoulderhigh
Horrified realization swept Somers
In another moment his gigantic bulk would be mangled here between these rocky sides
He saw Toro make leap and scramble upward
The ditch walls vere pressing but the upper surface had come down to Somers waist
He jumped drew himself up and rolled out
It seemed that the slit of rock was closing like reptiles mouth trying to seize his emerging legs
The upper surface familiar undu lating dirt and rocky terrain lay spread in the distance
As Somers staggered erect dizzy with the dwin dling scene again the murderous Toro came at him
OWN under the giant folds of the handkerchief Anne and her brother saw the enlarging form of Toro rush away and the gigantic Somers after him
Alden was aware of the danger
He lifted Anne
Can you walk guess so
Im better now Got to get outside get away
Theyll be too large might trample us An amazing scene encountered them as they ran outside
combat of giants
They saw the fallen Toro Somers astride his chest choking him
Men twenty feet tall
Now thirty feet
In another moment Alden realized these giants would trample the hand kerchief
The sweep of one of their legs would presently encompass hundred feet of this rocky ground
Anne was limping with twisted ankle
Alden picked her up carried her running to escape
can take the drug now Anne murmured
Foolish of me to be afraid of it
Put me dovn
Wed bet ter take it George He thought so too
The gigantic trouser legs of Somers and Toro great svaying pillars rising into the air lunged back and forth
Dizzying mammoth blurs in the gloom
The enormous bodies were blotting out the sky
Suddenly the Titan shapes lifted upward and were gone
Alden and Anne each took pellet of the drug
The valley closed in on them
They scrambled out to the surface
The giants were still fighting
There was more light out here and they were plainly visible
It seemed that now they were fully mile away
They swayed locked together
Five hundred feet tall
It seemed so
Then they went down rolling lung ing
Then up again staggering with mammoth strides
And then Anne cried Oh look
ELIXIR OF DOOM Dear God look at Roy Somers had
been beaten to his knees
Toros fists were raining blows upon him
Then suddenly as though with supreme effort Somers was erect
One of his arms dangled be hind him
The watchers saw that the dangling hand held boulder
And Somers heaved it aloft and crashed it down full on Toros head
There was breathless moment while Toro stood wavering
The boulder dropped with great roar to the ground and Somers staggered back panting
breathless instant
Then the body of Toro fell forward came toppling crashing down
For moment its thousandfoot length writhed and twisted
Then it lay still with the mammoth figure of Somers bending over it
CHAPTER Tiny Arena omers bent down panting over the fallen body of his antag onist
Toro was dead
No doubt of that the smashed weltering head was mute gruesome evidence
And there vas other evidence in that moment Somers was aware that the motionless dead thing was dwindling
Death had checked the effect of the drug
He stood now swaying over Toro
The body had seemed perhaps seven feet long
He saw it shrinking now
The whole rocky terrain was shrink ing
Vague distant blurs of monstrous shapes were dwindling coming closer taking familiar form
Why these tremendous green stalks they were blades of grass
That giant yellow white pole that was the matchstick
Somers hastily retreated
He must keep away from that matchstick
Al den and Anne might so easily be trampled
Minutes more of the shrinking landscape
And every moment it was more familiar
That great red blur in the sky that was the geranium blossom
Somers turned the other way
The great green stalks were thickening around him
Hardly higher than his head now and he pushed his way through them
Presently he was wad ing in them with their tops lower than his waist
He came to kneehigh parapet with an abyss beyond it and great blurred vista of open distance
But the blurs off there were taking form
The monstrous blurred spread of sur face off there so high and far away came down and shrank and showed itself to be the kitchen table
Somers stood peering over the brink of the flower boK
The vastness of the kitchen floor seemed hun dred feet below him
But soon it was fifty twenty
He swung over the edge
For mo ment he clung dangling by his hands
drop of ten feet
He let go
Land ed on his feet
The wall of the flow er box dwindled to his shoulders
The action of the drug was wear ing off
Somers sat on the open kitch en floor until the movement of the scene had ceased The little flower box was here
Two feet long foot wide six inches deep
He bent anxiously over the small spread of dirt peer ing waiting for Anne and her brother
They came at last
Tiny figures enlarging
Shoving through the grass climbing as he had climbed over the side and out of the box
Carefully he lifted the tiny sixinch figure of Anne and set her on the floor but the dizzying swoop of his carrying hand left her gasping
At last they were together again and all things assumed their normal proportions
Moonlight streamed in through the open window of the darkened kitch en
The placid summer ocean rippled with silver
Somers sat with Anne beside him
Alden was in the adjoin ing room at the radio sender
think Somers said out of si lence that the drugs should be de stroyed
Too dangerous
And the flower box the drugs are in it
De stroy this flower box The girl shuddered

The study of sugars and related com pounds belongs in the realm of organic chemistry the compounds of carbon
The Incredibly numerous compounds containing carbon are all due to the latters remarkable ability to hook up with almost anything in chains rings and other formations
All sugars are basically of the foimula given above but each is put together in different way with resulting differences in taste appearance and chemical activity
If the atoms in general sugar molecule were arranged merely by chance there could be different combinations
Only few dozen are known however
In organic chemistry the formula above means nothing
It simply indicate the pro portions by weight of carbon hydrogen and oxygen
For true indication of compo sition the organic chemist uses structural formulae which show exactly how the molecule is put together
He can show by the change in position of atom why this sugar and that are quite different
As typical example common alcohol has the same formula as methyl ether which is poisonous
When we look at the chemists structural formulae ve see how they are different
Alcohol is Methyl ether is This difference in hooking up makes all the difference be tween liquid which can be drunk and one which cannot besides many other differ nces
THE PHENOMENON OF SLEEP Editor Science Questions and Answers How is sleeping explained
When our brain sleeps why do not the heart or lungs do the same
The phenomenon of sleep has lately been much clarified
Intensive biochemical re search has revealed that there is rhythm to life
It pulsates much like wave
The pulsations are periods of activity and rest
Activity drives all the bodys chemical processes in one direction toward fatigue
This state is characterized by the presence of excess phosphates in the blood
To complete the cycle the organic organism must have rest
This allows the chemical processes to reverse and prepare for an other stretch of activity
Fortunately however nature has pro vided that our heart and lungs have different system of rest periods than our brain muscles and bodj cells in general
This was necessary because the animal or ganism cannot survive any extended period of rest for the heart lungs and stomach
These organs work and rest pulsate very rapidly
After each heartbeat the heart rests for fraction of second
After each breath the lungs take short nap The total amount of rest in days time for the heart is about the same as that we give our bodies when we lie down and sleep
CANALS OF MARS Editor Science Questions and Answers What is all the discussion on the canals of Mars about
Isnt it definitely known whether they are there or not
One would think such an easily observed phenomenon would have been settled long ago
Madison Wisconsin
Strange to say the authenticity of the Martian canals has not been proved
In Shiaparelli vho was admittedly sharpeyed announced that he saw fine line markings on Mars which he called canali Unfortunately that Italian word is far too suggestive when transposed to English
Shiaparelli meant channels not manmade canals
Since bis time the discussion has waxed furious
Famous astronomers corroborated his discovery
Equally famous ones denied their existence
Lately it is becoming gen erally credited that no such regular and numerous markings occur as Shiaparelli and and Lowell claimed to see
Experiments conducted in the laboratory indicate that the human eye and mind have tendency to connect faint spots and markings by wholly imaginary straight lines
In the case of viewing Mars in tele scope the image is very hazy at best
It literally takes conscious straining of the eye to distinguish even the larger markings
The socalled canals being at the limit of visibility may be subjective imagined rather than objective seen
Photography has failed to reveal the mythical canals
But the claim is made justifiably that un der the best of conditions the eye is more sensitive than the photographic plate so there is still no positive evidence on either side
Perhaps the only sure check on this en grossing question will be when man finds way to traverse space and explore Mars himself
FILTERABLE VIRUSES Editor Science Questions and Answers Ive noticed that the filterable viruses are being called living liquids as in the Farley story recently
Science fiction aside are they truly alive
San Francisco Calif
Strictly speaking the answer is probably no
Filterable viruses seem to be more of the quality of subtle poisons than of living matter
It seems that some diseases like the mosaic disease of the tobacco plant and silkworm jaundice produce lethal substance which is able to interfere with the metabolism of healthy tissue
Unlike cultures of germs the virus is filterable through the finest of porcelain filters indicating that it must have colloidal composition
Whatever the sub stance is which can reinfect tissue with the disease that produced it it is not composed of the germs and microorganisms we know at present
Either its potency is due to in credibly tiny living organisms matched in size by some of the larger molecules or to superpowerful poisons which in undetect able quantities can poison mass of pro toplasm unthinkably greater in mass

BINDER ILLUSTRATION LIKED By Fred Miles Here are orchids for two fine tales in the February issue of THRILLING WONDER STORIES The World in Box by Carl Jacobi and The Ice Entity by Jack Williamson
Though not as good as The Legion of Space The Ice Entity was vastly interesting story
Presented in the same issue as Jacobis stort story it helped to make the best of the four numbers of the rejuvenated Was very delighted to see draving by Jack Binder in this issue
The yarn it illustrated was the third best in my favor for the month
The cover was excellent
Almost photographic in its realism
Keep up the good work
New Providence New Jersey
FEARN THE TOPS By John Baltadonis Fearns story Brain of Venus takes the cake for February as far as Im con cerned
The way it started out thought for sure that the ending was obvious there was waiting for the introduction of the heroine to marry Captain Brant when bango he gets killed
That in itself stunned me but vhen the second hero of the story got killed Ive got to hand it to Fearn for having enough nerve to write story having two heroes and both getting killed
Protoplasmic Station by Paul Ernst wasnt as good as had expected it to be
However it did provide good reading mat ter
Invaders From the Outer Suns by Frank
Long Jr had novel twist
Williamsons Ice Entity was something new
Wandreis Black Fog looked like just another death cloud story at first
Only this time instead of hero and heroine emerging victorious at the end mankind really is doomed
Quite surprise twist
agree with Ronald Armitage on the subject of cartoons
Why not pick better subject
Frankfort Ave Philadel phia Penna
FIRST LETTER By John Hartos Having just finished the February issue of feel that must write you in appreciation
Carl Jacobis story World in Box is the best story in the issue
The others too are good
Zarnak by Max Plaisted is good idea and pleasant variation from the fiction con tent
The December issue rated pretty highly too
Zagats Lanson Screen and The BrainStealers of Mars by John Campbell Jr were among the best in that number
This is the first letter have ever writ ten to any magazine
Center Street Hempstead New York
Readers will be interested to learn that Mr Campbell has written more stories concerning the interplanetary adventures of his two in trepid spacerovers Blake and Penton
The first of these will soon be ready for publication
How about other firstletter writers sending in notes to this department
REQUESTS By John Chapman The February is the best of the four issues published up to now
If you keep improving as you have been youll soon reach the top
Fearns Brain of Venus was unusual
Try to obtain more of his stories
Wandrei comes second with Black Fog These two authors are about the only ones who really know how to end story with wallop
Instead of the routine procedure in which the fairhaired hero saves Earth and lives to win the heroine etc etc
Fearn discarded the hackneyed ballyhoo and reversed the situation so that the hero sacrificed himself to save the entire uni verse
And no heroine either
lU Judgment Sun will be the third Eando Binder story you have published since August
By all means keep up that pace
Binder is without doubt one of science fictions greatest writers and Ill never be tired of reading his stories
Some other authors Id like to see in are Murray Leinster Nat Schach ner Frank Kelly and Rowley Hilliard
The illustrations are great
Marchioni is the king of artists
Keep him and dont bother about securing anyone else unless it would be Paul
Como Ave
Minneapolis Minn Theres another Binder novelette for you next month his best story to date
OVERSEAS OPINION By Youd Although never wrote to the old mag azine am writing now to welcome the old mag back
It was with mingled feel ings that tore the wrapper off your December issue and saw that Paul was gone
Your cover artist is good however and Id like to see him alternate with Paul
Your layout is good
Especially the forecast for the next issue how about Coming Shortly feature
am looking forward to all the stories announced for the next number
The outstanding stories in the December issue were The Lanson Screen the only good story Ive ever read by Zagat and was it good
The BrainStealers of Mars the funniest story Ive read in ages Campbell is worthy successor to Weinbaum
And of course the Weinbaum tale Brink of In finity Galluns Saturns Ringmaster was appealing mainly because of the Uranian professor character
Lets have more stories about him
Would like to see stories by Miller Hamilton Leinster Keller Harris Hil liard Pragnell Williamson and Zagat if he can produce another like The Lanson Screen Desborough Road East leigh Hants England
NOSEGAYS AND BRICKBATS By Norm Sirirsger was very glad to see the reappearance of your magazine on the newsstands al though there is room for improvement

Zagat told an old story with new twist while Cummings and Hamilton took hackneyed but interesting plots and filled their stories with exciting adven tures
So ended the good half of the mag azine
As for the inferior stories they were EarthVenus by Gabriel Wil son
This story was good once but long ago
Well written though taking sixth place
Echols story was formula stuff
Static was too short and dry
Now for some general criticisms
You should try to print serial
novelette should be at least sixteen pages long
Keep your authors away from the timeworn themes
is only published every other month
believe that it should be published monthly or oftener
And here are bouquets
has brought back many famous old authors to science fiction
Cummings Merritt Farley Kline Burks theyre all good
The gen eral run of your stories tend to be written in the principle of story first then science This is vise plan story may be dominant in science and have an entire ly new conception but it will fail to hold the readers attention because it is poorly written and then again story may be well written and fail to click because the plot is too old
Consequently your stories cover larger scope because your require ments as to science content are more tol erant
My ten favorites are Merritt Burroughs Cummings Farley Williamson Burks Leinster Coblentz Verrill and Hamilton
Six of these men write for you
Keep them

would like to experi ment with black light infrared and photo electric cells
Also with electricity especially the more startling and amazing phenomena that can be achieved with the proper preparations
would like to know where can get information and equipment for these ex periments

We fellers like to know what others think of know all this is big order to fill but by all means try to enlarge Science Questions and Answers Fifth Street Washington There are seven questions and answers in this issue
By Irving Koskow Although the December issue of THRILLING WONDER STORIES is the best of your three issues thus far there remain some minor imperfections
First and foremost take that comic
strip Zarnak out
Its not only child ish but silly
Please bear in mind that many of your readers are not adolescents and constitute goodly portion of your circulation
The space wasted on Zarnak could be used to advantage in enlarging The Reader Speaks must congratulate you on the other departments and features
Most note worthy of these are Story Behind the Story and Scientifacts BrainStealers of Mars was most novel and interesting of all the stories in the issue
There is but one correction Id like to offer concerning this story
Granted that type of animal such as described is capable of changing its protoplasm given sufficient amount to vork with how could it possibly reproduce space suit or bits of metal which are not or ganic from organic protoplasm
Mutiny on Europa was fine tale on par with Campbells yarn
Fulton Street Brooklyn
How many readers like Zarnak
Theres fmiouH battle going on about the strips merits
Come on Plaisted supporters lets hear from you
What kind of plot would you want Zarnak to have
Your point about the Campbell story is well taken but remember that the thushol did not create the space suits they stole them from the space ship
They could only simulate inorganic substances ex ternally of course

SCIENCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Continued from Page eases credited to the activity of filterable viruses
Such poisons which could grow almost like microbes in new host would be on the order of enzymes feiments which dis solve and change organic matter and in crease at the same time their own amounts
Enzymes are purely chemical nonliving materials
Yet it is still an open question whether the filterable virus is micro microbe culture in which case it would be alive Ed
Note According to data made available just as we were going to press filterable viruses have been discovered to be protein molecules existing on the borderline be tween the living and the nonliving
SKIN PIGMENTATION Editor Science Questions and Answers Albinos are explained as lacking pigmen tation
How does this occur
Can there be albinos of any animal
Hartford Conn
Although no complete survey has been made it is undoubtedly possible that there can be and have been albinos in every species of animal
White blackbirds white crows white swifts white rabbits white rats and such are well known where the original stock is heavily pigmented
In albinos the factors for pigmentation have been lost in the intricate nuclear com binations which occur in the ripening germcells
In the case of an animal with one of the dark pigments melanins it is necessary for ferment tyrosinase to act on pigmentproducing substance called tyrosin
If either factor drops out of in heritance the fertilized eggcell develops into an albino
The phenomenon is com paratively rare because the pigment cells are hardy in the biological sense being closely related to skin cells which are toughest of all
There is also form of albinism which is acquired rather than prenatal
Cases have been observed of animals such as chickens changing from black to white or move rarely of human hair whitening over night
In such cases of false albinism the pigment matter can be found to have moved to new locale as for instance the liver
It is depigmentation rather than nonpigmentation
ASTRONOMy SUPERSTITIOUS
Editor Science Questions and Answers Is there direct connection between the motions of the moon around Earth and Earth around the sun
If so why doesnt our calendar indicate that the true month is onethirteenth of vear
Salt Lake City Utah
There is no mechanical connection between the separate orbital motions of Earth and moon
If the moon were miraculously to increase its speed of revolution by twice it would move outward from Earth but Earth would not change its periods of ro tation and revolution noticeably
By coincidence the moons period of rev olution divides almost exactly thirteen times into year
The ancients tried their best to work the moonperiod into the year with indifferent success
In the heydey of Roman civilization no two people agreed as to the year since the first of the Caesars
Julius Caesar with the aid of competent astronomer established in the calendar bearing his name which is in use today except for the modifications made by Pope Gregory in Julius CaesaPs success in making calendar that lost no more than three days in years was due to his disregarding the period of the moon entirely which is incommensur able with the year
ANiMAL LONGEVITV Editor Science Questions and Answers dont believe personally that cat has nine lives but Ive heard some wild stories of how cats survive all sorts of deaths and lots of people believe in it
Now lets see what scienceeditor would have to say about it besides plain Bah Long Branch
cat has fundamentally one life and one only
One bullet in its brain will kill it as suiely as it would any other creature
But the cat does seem to have special tenacity for that one life
For one thing it has by long evolution ary processes developed to perfection the art of always landing on its feet
This faculty measurably increases its chances for longevity
Then it has those richly in nervated long hairs or whiskers in its cheeks which apprise it of danger in the dark upon contact
Added to this is an ability to see in depths of gloom in vhich most other creatures except owls and bats are totally blind
It also has the homing instinct strongly developed which enables it often to reach safety and shelter when stranded
Physically it has highly devel oped efficient body well protected from teeth to claws
Its senses of smell and hearing are very acute
And lastly it has far more intelligence than is generally sus pected
Its seeming dumbness is camou flage for firstclass thinking organ
All these points in its favor taken to gether give the cat distinct advantage in the grim game of eluding death
It is questionable whether even the anthropoids with their semihuman intelligence have greater survival value than the felines
Only man with his guns and snares has the power to rob the cat family of prestige in the iunele

MAGINATION among scientists is still the priceless ingredient
The wars of the future will be fought if at all in the atomic labora tory
And its safe bet that the har nessing of atomic energy will be dis covered only by accident
Through out the history of science accident has been the important agency respon sible for uncovering the great scien tific wonders
For example in Berthold Schwarz was attempting to find compound for making the philosoph ers stone
All of sudden his table of chemicals exploded on him
Gun powder was discovered
GALVANSS DISCOVERY In an Italian doctor named Luigi Galvans quite by accident came upon dramatic scene which gave us electricity in circuit
Galvani noticed that vhenever his electric machine began to spark between electrodes frogs legs which he had freshly dissected lying on metal plate began simultaneously to twitch as though it were alive
By hanging dozen frogs legs to dry by copper hooks on an iron grille he played with the idea of animation again and the whole line began to move even vithout the aid of the electric machine nearby
Thus cur rent was born
And so it will be in the future
Scientists with imagination and en thusiasm will scoop their more prac ticalminded contemporaries

Following is the best letter written by Mr Robert Madle The question What can do to promote science fiction has often confronted the really Interested science fiction enthusiast
If per son is actively interested in science fiction he goes to any extremes within reason of course to stimulate interest in the type of fiction he loves
In ray three years of scientifictional activities have employed various methods of introduc ing science fiction to the general public
At school in my English class often devote my oral lessons to sclentifiction
Many of my written compositions are also based on science fiction
Of course there are those who scoff at my choice of reading matter but have interested quite few hitherto antisolencefictionists
An other of my favorite methods is to make pres ent of copy of science fiction magazine to person in whom think could develop an interest in stories of the fantastic

There are other ways of promoting science fiction
One method is to have an article pro pounding the interests of science fiction pub lished in the local newspaper
Unfortunately reside in large city and this makes the task much more difficult
If student it would be advisable to submit an article per taining to science fiction to the school paper as this would surely bring in more converts to sf
As soon as have composed an article which consider good it will immediately be submitted to the editor of my paper There are probably ways other than the above to accomplish your intention but those afore mentioned are the ones which consider the mnsjt effective

ELIXIR OF DOOM Concluded from page Frankensteins monster it had killed its creator
Again Somers and Anne were si lent awed by their memories
The little flower box stood here before them
The moonlight through the window streamed brilliantly down upon it
Little arena
Small spread of caked dirt with fuzz of tiny grass and forlorn geranium at its center
What amazing realms of smallness lay hid den here
The match still stood with tiny scratch in the dirt beside it
few inches away toward the gerani um the dirt was softer
There was tiny broken mound
Somers mind swept back
worm had poked it self up there and then wriggled away
He bent closer
Even now he could distinguish the body of Toro
speck on the dirt near the upright rnatch stick
And as he stared he saw two tiny black ants struggling over the ridges of the dirt
They came upon the tiny speck
They stood for moment pick ing it apart
And then they carried it away

thin of terror lurked in hiding waiting to work its ghastly evil upon heautiful Leila MonroyJ
Was her lover in truth the monster who sought herf Was it lovely Eve her best friend
Or were Leilas darkest suspicions correcP could it he that she herself changed periodically into the thing of horror and death that haunted that stricken countryside he house was full of whispers
LeBa Mooroy patlieticaHy small iu the huge wiisMed easy chair fumbled at her throat
sob was trying to rise there knotting her musdes with
sort of phjracal pain
The house was ftdl of whispers
The ancient fannliouse that always had been her home was an abo of brooding dread place of dark despair
The groaning of the old timbers drying fibers seemed ter ribly loud in the oppressive silence
They came from the very walls about Leila from the agedarkened rafters overhead from the ominous gloom of the entrance hallway that somehow repelled tlie living room Hffht from the broad staircase Daringly Differeni Long fovel of Eerie Mystery and Weird Unholy Passiim TERROR TALES twisting upward out of that foyer to ap pallingly empty obscurity above
The house was full of whispers shred ding Leilas frayed nerves with terrible reminders of her days long agony
Just such place of muted ominous sounds had the courtroom been
Unshed tears through the anguished hours had blurred its crowded benches and the only reality had been the gaunt suffering figure of her greyfaced father in the prisoners dock
But the whispers had been inescapable
All day they had hissed at her as they were hissing now mutterings of horror as witness after witness had damned Jus tin Monroy with husked tales of brutal unutterably savage killing gasps of out rage when Leila herself gave halting testi mony that she had been with her father here in this room all the fatal hour be tween the time when Shean Rourke had last been seen alive and the time when Foster Corbett had found his hacked and mangled corpse beneath the poplars divid ing the two farms
Whispers had met the exhausted girl whispers of tightlipped condemnation when at last she had stumbled down from the witness chair and the farmerwomens Sunday silks had rustled selfrighteously drawing away from the defiling touch of the girl who hostile eyes said had lied desperately to save bloodguilty slayer
Whispers whispers whispers seething out of the pulsating silence as the stony faced jury marched back into their box
And then the whispers had become soundless scream searing Leilas breast as the dreadful verdict soughed from the foremans tight throat
While insane Insane
The recollection flung Leila Monroy up out of her chair held her rigid in distress
The word hissed within her skull hissed from the stark vacancy in which she was so utterly alone with terror and despair
Slithering foli age stirred by swiftly rising wind hissed it at her from the terrible outer night
Insane The kindly tender old man to whose gnarled hand she had clung as the brown clods thudded on the drab wood of her mothers coffin the hardworking weatherbeaten oldster who had been fath er and mother to her through so many years madman
Her father
From whose veins came the blood surging now so darkly in her veins
Leila quivered
Tremors ran through the long delicate curves of her slim form
The tiny oval of her smallfeatured coun tenance blanched with new dismay
His blood in her veins
What if that blood were tainted with foul lust to kill with an stavistic urge to tear with fang and claw to rend human flesh and taste the warm saltsweet tang of human lifefluid on smacking gory lips
What if she had not really drowsed that halthour whose lapse fatally had invalidated her testi mony
Had she run instead ravening by his side while fearful heritage of homicidal madness blotted memory from her soul as the alienists said it had blot ted recollection from Justin Monroys
BRUPTLY the light within was paled by blue blaze glaring in through the window on which her unseeing stare was fixed by lightning that split the skys black vault with jagged and blazing frac ture
Thunder blast became to the shocked girl the devastating roar of an enormous beast that leaped on the house that bat tered it that shook it in huge jaws whose slaver was driving rain
Storm tumult howled about the old walls crashed through the empty rooms drowned out tlw whispers that had tortured Leila drowned out the whispers in her harried brain
Almost after the first terrific on slaut she was grateful for the fury PRIESTESS OF MURDER li that woid loiter let her hear those whispei
But it could not drown her dreadful thoughts
Np she moaned
Merciful Lord no
as she had mcned when Justin Monroys suave attorney had elicited from the baldpated alienist glib testimony that had saved his client from the deathchair and condemned him to living hell
Nol It be true
ootdd have done nothing else the lawyer lad answered her reproaches af terward
It was your fathers ax Foster Corbett found buried in the dead mans chest
Ypuf fathers footprints were traced ottt of the trampled mess around the corpse surf across the meadow to your back porch
There was the old boundary line feud between your father and his neighbor his threats that if Foster Corbett or his oon Stanley or his farm hand Shean Rourice stejed on Monroy land they would regret it
Against that we had only your won
that he was seated in the rown with you all evening
And on cross examination you admitted that you had fallen asteep The wind pounded against the door as their fists had pounded coming to accuse Dad of the awful deed
Foster Corbett triumphant at last over his ancient ad versary
Stan Corbett Leilas pale lips writhed
Stanl In his arms she had known happmess against her lips his lips had thrilled
Defiant of the enmity between their fathers they had loved
If State Trooper Stanley Corbett had fired his gun into her heart he could no more cruelly have slain that love than he had by sayir to her father Youre under arrest Mr Monroy Rain lashed against the window in spasm of new fury
The world was ablaze with flickering dectric flare that spilled bluely on the tossing poplars marching along the treemarked boundary between the two farms
It was ju there that Shean Rourkes corpse Somethii moved stealthily vague and black among the windbent trunks Darkness smashed down again
Who was it
Who prowled the stormdrenched night
The demoniac slayer who had made ghastly horror of what once had been man
The tea
killer stalking new prey
Stalking her
Icy fingers clutched Leila Monroys throat chill priddes tickled her spine
Hi bloodthirst still unslaked inflamed by bis terrible crime for which Dad unjustly had been con demned to terrible expiation the murderer was creeping up on her
On her An ancient legend of whispered terror trailed slimy speculation across her fear
name breathed with shudders of appre hension by the gaffers clustering around the cberrybellied stove in the village
The Monster of West Cliff
The traditional phantom that was reputed to haunt the stony precipice whose sheer rampart rose behind the fertile plain along which from north to south lay the three neighboring farms of the Corbetts the Monroys and the Stars
Often of late he had bear seen stalking the dark belt of primeval forest cloaking the base of th cliff the elusive appalling wraith it was said of an Indian chief whose tribe had been massacred by the plains first settlers
Stalking the ages waiting for chance at gruesome revaige
Every accident every unexplained disaster of the country side was ascribed to him
Was it he who OTORMBLAZE arched the heavens once more exploding into momentary existence the tempesttormented trees the downpourbeaten pasture between
They were deserted vacant as the house itself
Nothing no one was anywhere in sight
The prowling shadow had been an illu sion figment of her anguished brain Wait
The iituned sight had TERROR TALES recalled something to Leila
An incident of the fateful night that she had utterly forgotten till now till it was too late
The girl groaned beat her breast in bitter self condemnation
Stepping to this very window that eve ning to pull down its shade she had seen or thought she had seen Foster Corbett dodging behind the tool shed just visible left of the house
She had said nothing to her father fearing to excite him fear ing to jeopardize the reconciliation for which she and Stan plotted
The terrible events following had obliterated the mat ter from her memory
Utterly till now
How could she have forgotten it its astounding implication
The murderaxe whose bloodsmeared helve had shown no fingerprints had come from that very shed
Perhaps it was not yet too late
Per haps if she told her story Shrill sound sliced across the thought
It stopped spurted again
Rrrring rrrring rrring
It whirled Leila around to it
Rrrring rrring rrring
The tele phone
Three rings the Monroy signal
Who could be phoning her
In credible
Eve Starr perhaps
Eve her neighbor and closest female friend calling to extend sympathy consolation
Like Eve to remain loyal when every one else shunned her
Rrrring rrring Leila flinging across the room into the hallways dimness jerked the receiver from its hook
Hello Lock your doors hoarse unrecog nizable voice grated without preamble
Lock your windows voice choked coarsened by some inexplicable terror
Dont let any one in
Not any The telephone was suddenly dead with the flat inanimate deadness of line from which the humming life of its current has gone
Had the storm blown down frail wire or had some human hand cut it
Some human hand just too late to stop the husked warning
Some human hand
Icy terror one more struck at Leila Monroy
The hand of some one who even now crept up on the house
Then she was moving had flung herself to the great front door was thrusting into its socket the heavy bolt clamped to its sturdy oak
The back door was already locked she remembered
The windows
Oldfash ioned shutters creaked out of recesses in their embrasured sides to the frantic pull of her trembling hands were also bolted
She rushed in frenzied haste through din ing room through kitchen clicking on light as she went light from which sliad ows fled that were black sinister silhou ettes waiting around comers behind doors to spring upon her
The lower floor was at last blaze of light was locked and barred fortress against what ever menace threatened
The lower floor But there was the upstairs yet the up stairs that was blacker as Leilas dilated pupils stared up into its mystery because of the luminescence about her
No longer was it the warm familiar bedroom floor of the old house but precinct of stygian gloom haunted by some darknessshrouded threat
The girls small fingers tightened on the newel post to which she clung tight ened till the blood was driven from them and they were grey trembling splotches against the lustrous patina of the wood
It was only the dark up there of which she was afraid
Over and over she told it to herself
It was only because of the dark that she had that hint of evil lurking just beyond the stairhead of monstrous evil crouched just beyond the range of her vision haunched and waiting to pounce upon her
There was nothing more in the corridor above Leila assured herself than shadows like the eerie phantoms that PRIESTJESS OF MURDER had fled from the lights she had turned on
shriek sliced down to her the hh shrill scream of wom in deadly taror
It checked off faded into vague thump ings as of fierce struggle into the thud of stormtossed brandr against the build ing wall It came again
INY muscles twitched in Leilas cheeks
Insensate humorless laughter sounded in her fluttering throat
It was the wind that had screamed from up there tightening her scalp with fear
It must have been the wind
No one could pos sibly be op there
Bui she was afraid
Afraid to go there and look
Afraid of the storm and the dark
sharp crackle jerked her around She stared wideeyed at the entrance door
That had been only the splintering of galeriven brandi It came again
Unmistakable this time
The crunch of heel on the gravel pathway outside
foot thudded on the porch just be yond the door and unseen fingers rattled the door knob
Through crashing peal of thunder the terrified girl heard threat ening hoarse bellow
Swneone was just the other side of the sturdy portal
Some one The killer The mad killer seeking her
He bellowed again pounded wild fists on the wood
The great panel shuddered under flie berserk attack
Its hinges creaked
The furious pounding piled frizied terror on her fear of the storm and the dark
Realization pierced her that only five feet of air two indies of wood sqsarated her from the monstrous creature that had made of Shean Rourke mangled horror
It twisted her about sent her hurtling headlong up the stairs that moment before dread bad barred to her sent her dashing dirou the light less corridor in instinctive flight to tlie fancied sanctuary of her own bedroom
Her hand clutched the knob of its door swung her to it Franctically she thrust open the panel slammed it shut behind her leaned back against it gasping quiv ering
Rain lashed against the window pane threshed on the roof above her
Dulled by distance the savage pounding on the door below beat about Leila as though tangible blows buffeted her
Momentarily the lightning had ceased
The chamber was obliterated by tarbarrd daricness
feeling grew on Leila dial she was not alone here
Leila Monroy whimpered stabbed blind ly at the lightswitch she knew jutted from the wall to her right
The small room sprang into sight dishevelled appari tion stared at her from her dresser mir ror russet wedth of hair tumbling about her now pallid face mouth twisting and livid grey eyes dark with the frenzy of her terror
She pulled her gaze from it saw the bed Crumpled on its scarletflecked counter pane lay the contorted body of girl
Blueblack hair veiled her face but where pink frock had been cruelly tom away lurid fingermarks on white throat showed the manner of her death
Her death there was no motion no movement at all in the awful stillness of the pathetic figure
The exposed blanched breast stirred with not the slightest breath Eve Leila whimpered unable to do no more than stare aiul whimper
Eve Forgotten the tumult of the storm the battering at the entrance door
Forgotten everything but the horror that burst with in her skull
But she had no memory of Eves arrival
No mory
Time must have dropped out of her consciousness
Time owHigh for her to TERROR TALES have summoned the girl to have lured her up here
Time enough for her own hands to have clenched on her friends throat to have pressed pressed until life no longer throbbed beneath her throttling fingers
CHAPTER TWO The Phantom in the Treei TT SEEMED to Leila Monroy that she could feel in her icy palms memory of the soft fleshs slow crumple beneath their lethal construction
Once she had hated Eve when the girl quite openly had tried to win Stan Corbett away from her
That jealous hatred had passed away with her own triumph and they had been friends again
Had it passed
Had it not rather sprung to sinister existence with the blood madness inherited from the father they had led away to padded cell
Darkness smashed down as the light went out
The window was momentarily blue oblong flickering with the electric radiance of lightning
Leila voice came up to her
Open up
Its Stan Leila
Stan Stan
He had come for her as he had come for her father
He had come to drag her shrieking to the same chamber of horrors where Justin Moore had agon ized
He would have to catch her first
If she were mad she would avail herself of lunatics cunning
From window at the end of the passage rainspout clamps made an easy ladder to the ground
Tlie storm would hide her she would bury herself in the woods Leila got the door open behind her flung out into the hall
Thunderous crash of the portal below met her and the tempests howl blasting in through the house
The sound whirled her startled glance in its direction
The stairs were in darkness
Stans feet thudded on the steps com ing up
Lightning glimmer threw Stans climb ing shadow against the wall made visible the face of crouching figure
It was the grizzled distorted face of Foster Cor bett
Of Stans own father Waiting for his son with revolver uplifted in his hand
Stan Leila screamed
Look out
Hes shout drowned her out blast of bestial fury
Somewhere shot blazed and then the world crashed in on her
She fell headloi into limbo of whirling coruscating sparks
She felt herself lifted in powerful arms felt herself thrown over heaving shoulder
Shouts shots echoed about her gibbering chatter of apelike defiance
Rain drenched her an icy gale pounded at her
Oblivion claimed her
LAST Leila dared to lift her lids bit by slow bit
She blinked
Dark ness was about her strangely mottled with glancing fragments of silvery light
Darkness and glistening dank rock above her
The earthy smell of tomb in her nostrils
She was it dawned on her in shallow cave
The luminous flecks dancing about her were splotches of moonlight shifting through the leaves of high trees
This must be West Cliff then
Leila thrust herself up to sitting pos ture as terror sliced her
Was this the cave of the Monster
But there wasnt any Monster she thought
There was only the criized slayer who had hacked Shean Rourke with an ax who had throttled Eve Starr who had crouched with lethal gun to shoot down Stan Corbett
Not any phantom Monster
Not Justin Mon PRIESTESS OF MURDER toy either nor Leila hwself
Foster Corbett
For moment Leila forgot her pain her danger in the jubilance of that revela tion
Dad was no maniac killer nor was she
It was Foster Corbett who had schemed with the cunning of the insane to slay and pfece the blame for his crime on the man he hated
Foster Coiett who had dragged second victim to Leila Mon roys bed so that the daughter should be doomed the same terrible fate to which he had condemned the father
Foster Cor bett who losing all hold on ron had haunched in th stormbattered corridor waiting to kill his own son
Had he
Had he added filicide to the role of his crimes
sliot had blazed across her scream of warning just before the madman had whirled to attack her
If Stan had fired edtl tmaniac could not have moved so sw scljftllt had been fifed at Stan then itself in his breast
In the le areaof the man ste loved
Leila Ha iirom springing to her feet knew ternrrilthathaer love for Stan was no not de sob tre at her throat
She ne rcgb to him
Reddess othpaiosgojt that at EEtred ward to the caves entrance
Then she froze as rattle of rolling pebbles came up to her from bdow tire cavern mouth Of stones dislodged by some one cHmbing the face of the cliff
He was coming for her
He had home her here left her here wliile he pursued some other dreadful mission of his mur derlusting brain and now he was return ing to work his mad wdl upon ha

TERROR TALES Helpless
Leila Monroys lip snarled up from her tiny teeth
She was suddenly creature of the wilds
The desperate courage of hopelessness entered into her the feral cunning of wildernesss small beasts who will fight must fight when escape from their persecutors has become no longer possible
She stooped snatched handfuls of jagged stones from the cave floor flitted to its entrance silent as cloud
EILA peered out and down slyly cau tious
There he was Like huge black spider clinging to the splattered bare precipice
Working his way up indomita bly slowly by the necessity of finding handholds footholds in the bare sheer rock face
Hidden now by pool of stygian shadow revealed now by frag ments of leafsplintered moonlight
In exorably climbing to add her to the dread ful list of his victims
Distorted by the eerie light he was somehow unhuman somehow monster of primitive evil spewed out of the past
And Leila Monroy the weak thing he hunted was primitive too
Primitive and pitiless
Her hand flew back arced for ward
stone left it and struck fair on the skull of the maniac
The crunch of its landing came up to her sickened her but she flung another stone and another
dark splotch apfeared on his forehead and then the man let go his holds plunged down black sprawling figure crashed terribly in the underbrush below
thrill of triumph ran through Leila hot thrill of triumph that was torrid flame boiling in her blood
Her laugh bubbled up in the dark silence of the for est
shrill thin cacchination of black laughter spilling from her gaping throat rioting out in the rainwashed night
It was horrifying
Her throat clamped on it
She checked it icy with loathing of the savagery that had inspired it quiv ering with revulsion at the thing she had become
She had killed man and laughed with joy at the deed
She Leila Monroy
Qiff and forest whirled about her in sudden vertigo
The hot flush of joy at Corbetts thumping fall the jubilant laughter were these the reactions of san ity
Soaring glee at killing only luna tic could feel it only homicidal maniac
While insane What if the incredible acts she had ascribed to Foster Corbett were fetid illusions of her own darkened mind
What if she were in deed the lunatic slayer and he good neighbor trying to save her from herself the victim of her mania
What if her hand that had slain him was gory already with the blood of Eve Starr and of Stan
Not Stan
That at least was clear to her even in her bewilderment
If Stan were slain she could not have slain him
There was the test
Only madman would kill his own son
Corbett or she
She or Corbett
If Stan were alive she was the maniac
If he were dead If he were dead the thought slashed at her like sword
That she should hope for his death her Stan
Broadshoul dered upstanding frank eyed
Rath er that she be condemned to the eternal perdition of raving madness rather that she take knife and slice it across her own throat
Bullets do not always kill
Was he lying thqre wounded des perately wounded suffering
Not dead but bleeding to death while she dallied here delaying the aid that might save him
Leila licked dry lips with trembling tongue
She was down on her knees on the narrow ledge that made sort of porch to the caye
She swung over it was scrambling for footing against the sheer wall of the rock was inching down that perilous descent while weakness was PRIESTESS OF MURDER Kke water in her limbs while pain was network of agony meshing her frail form
Stan His name was pra er on her lips as she attained the cliffs foot at last as she sent one shuddering glance at the still mound blacker against black that her missies had flung there
Stan She plunged into the thicket
TWISTED root caught Leilas foot pounded her headlong into the mire
She lay as she fell heaving in great breaths of the dank air to her tortured lungs fighting for strength to rise to go on
The forest silence closed in on her black pall of soundlessness
Not altogether soundless
vague ominous slither threaded it
It lifted Lei las head with jerk despite the darts of agony shooting through her at even that slight effort
It pulled her burning stare through the treeboles that were grotesque giants reaching writhing arms down to pluck her from her miry bed
And then her scalp suddenly tightened
It drifted almost silently toward her wraithlike phantasmal
vagrant beam caught it full and scream formed in Leilas breast tore her constricted throat died at her lips
The phantom of Eve Starr was gliding toward her between the ebon trees
Eve Starr whose corpse Leila had seen con torted in awful death on the gorestained counterpane of her own bed
CHAPTER THREE Dreamiand of Dread EILA MONROYS blood jelled with in her veins
Supernal terror queezed her heart as the apparitions ghastly approach held her eyes with the tppalled but helpless stare of reptile ludnated bird
And twig snapped beneath Eve Starr feet
The sharp crackle of dried wood break ing beneath the pressure of careless foot so little thing to save one from blither ing madness
It forced reason into Leilas shuddering terror stung her to sanity with the realization that this was not disem bodied ghost advancing toward her through the obscurity of the fearfilled wood that it was flesh and blood that it was Eve Leila moaned finding strength somehow to stand up
Eve Startled the duskyhaired girl swung around to her fright distorting her blood less countenance
Whos there she gasped
Who is it Her eyes were bumedout coals dark horror pitting the blanched whiteness of her visage
Who Its Leila hon
Leila Monroy Leila Stark terror in that gusted ex clamation
Leila Her hand went up to her throat to the blue bruises that splotched its whiteness the marks of throttling fingers
Of whose fingers
Leila Monroy knew that she must ask the terrible question though she was terrified of what the answer might be
Eve she blurted
Who did that to you
Was it
Was it Eve Leila Eve hadnt heard her
Dont touch me Or had she heard and was this the awful answer to the momentous question
Keep away The girl whirled dashed away
Started to dash away
She stumbled went to her knees snatched for support at the rattling withes of low bush swayed there in pitiful weakness
She was feeble so feeble
The cold and the damp of the woods would kill her before morn ing if she were left here alone

Evei She TOuIdnt last long

Eve Leila reeled after her
CIRANGELY enough Eve mamed to keep just ahead of bw just beyond reach
She was flitting staggering form just ahead of Leik always just ahead dwayv just about to drop but somdiow kecfmg ir feet somehow maintain ing httle ace between them

Had disappeared
She wasnt anywhere in st and there was no sound to tell where she had gone
Had she after been pursuing phan tom created hy her own mad brain
Was rile doomed forever to wander dream land of drid in which siis would be un able to distinguish the from the un real
Doomed forever see these very trees seemed instinct with baleful life
They semed to be closh in on
One of them aur movii was coming toward her with slow iidmitely evil de liberatiott
It couldnt be moving
She was imagunng it
How could tree move
It wasnt tree
It was bent massive ure of man huge browless head set neckires on gargauiriuan shoulders iHonzed naked torso gleaming eeri in the moonlight IMe pilike fes Row ing redty out of an imbeciUc droding countenance
It was the Monr of the Qiff
But she had killed the Monster
No fliat was Foster Corbett she had killed
This Monster didnt exist
It was fig ment of Her knsnarion this bestial thing that crept inexordly toward her
It wasnt there at all and she wouldnt run from it
If she didnt run from it it would vanish smd she would be sane again
She must not be afraid of it
She must not be afraid of the bigmuscled arms that seemed to reach out for her of the stubbed and fearful talons
That closed on her arms with sud den fearful pain diat told her the thing was real
That told her too late diat it was rcjU
Ldla screamed hut tfie shrill cry of lier terror and her ony was drowned by the ferocious overwhelming roar of the Moa PRIESTESS OF MURDER ter
Towering over her he slammed her against the shaggy unyielding bark of giant tree behind her trying to crush her it seemed into the very heart of the quiv ering timber driving breath from her so that she could scream no longer
She could not scream but she could flail desperate fists against the steelhard thews of his giant arms
The beast laughed at her puny efforts chatteringly gibber ingly
His blacklipped mouth opened to display yellow rotted fangs cavity in which the flesh was not red but hideous black
Leila writhed jerked free
Almost jerked free
The Monsters knee came up thrust excruciatingly into the softness of her abdomen pinned her helpless against the rough treebark behind that cut through her flimsy dress and stabbed her with countless tiny points
Pinned her helpless so that one of his bestial paws released its grip and flew to the neckline of her frock
It tore downward as the seamed hairless countenance mowed with insensate obscene glee
Pretty the thing chattered
Pretty and his leathery palm fumbled at Leilas breast rasped it with lewd caress
Cal ban likes rpHE girls hand spatted against the in durated cheek her toes banged at the Monsters shins
He squealed like stuck pig and his fingers flew to her throat clutched it constricted
Leilas lungs pumped unavailingly fight ing for air they could not find
The brutal digits tightened still more till the girl thought they must cut right through the flesh must squeeze clear through her neck
Knives stabbed and twisted within her chest invisible fingers gouged at her eyes
The glaring ferocious visage of her tormentor vanished in great roaring blackness
Through which she seemed to hear high piercing whistle
The roaring in her skull was drowned in the blast of Cal bs feral roar
The whistle came again and Leila crashed to the ground as the terrible grip on her throat the pinning thrust of the bestial knee were released
Leila wallowed in her distress while somewhere above her tumultuous sound crashed momentarily and died away
She pulled air into the sore agony of her lungs
Leila Stan cried somewhere above her
It wasnt Stan
It couldnt be Stan
Stan was nng dead in the old house that had suddenly become an abode of horror
Stan had bled to death there because she had not been able to get to him in time to save him
Leila darling Hands were tugging at her were roll ing her over
Stans hands
His dear face was looking down at her anxiety clouding his eyes
Stans face
Speak to me
Leila The girl sat up
He was dishevelled
His troopers uniform was gashed tom by the tearing brambles of the forest and there was livid weal across his tanned cheek that lashing tendril had mbde
But he was alive
It was Stan who had saved her at the last possible moment from an awful death
What how did you get here
How was knocked out there in your house came to heard the back door close
rushed out there and saw you vanishing into the woods
Ive been hunt ing for you
Then wasnt
Dont talk now Stan silenced her
Youre hurt exhausted
When get you home get you warm you can tell me all about it He was tender solicitous
He loved her tiil
Leila nestled in his arms thrilling RRQR TALES to his strengtfi thrilling to tlie feel of his heart beating inst her own
She would yey him she wold keep qniet ior few mititJtes
If started to talk if told him that it had been Eve be had seen not her she would have to tell him the rest
She would have to tel
him that the girl hi his arms bad killed his father
How could she tel
him that
How could she
The black trees of the forest slid by nistling in the night
Leila whimpered
Hush darling Stan murmured
Well soon be out of this
Well soon be where its warm and light Light
Would there ever be light again in her dark soul
Daricer than ever now
Thought burred through Leilas aching brain
Stan had been attacked in the house had been Imecked unconscious
That was evident
Foster Corbett must have done that Iyit in ambush
Ttien Leila must be san But Eve Starrs actions bad confirmed tlie awftd speculation that it was Leila who had attacked her
Leila in whose mind no mory remained of the terri ble deed
That proved her insane
There wasnt any answer
There culd nt be any answer because she didnt know tow much of her experiences was real bow much she had forgotten how modi she tod imagined
The Monster for instance
Stans comii had saved her frn him but Stan didnt seem to kjiow anything about him
Had that lecherous attack been only her own mad ness
Had her own mamac fingers tom the clothes from her shoulders clamped tightening about her own throat
Or had Stans call his ttocshing approach frightened the brute away be fore the trooper could see him
Over Stans shoulder Leila saw shadow move high up on the bough of tree
It liaunched came sprawling down great aims fialKng spread spatuiate talons clawing for Stans throat CHAPTER POWt Masur oi dw Moaitn CTAN Leila Monroy shrieked and contorted in his arms driving her forehead against bis chest
This instan taneous inspiration of her terror was the only thing that could have saved her lover
It imbalanced him sent him reeling backward and the downdropping mon ster missed his mark
The brute crashed down into the under brush was mentarily tangled in the whipping leaves in that instant Leila slipped from Stans hold as the trooper recovered his footing and reached for his hollered gua
Calban bdlowed soared frcHn the ground
His stoggy arm lashed ahead of him with cotoas lightning like lash sUuck Stans gunwrist pound ed the weapon from it Its metallic gieain sliced into the underbru and the antag onists came tether with thud of fiesh against fie that was thunderous to the terrifiai girl
Stans fists pumped two flashing is tons into Calbans taut belly
The mon sters musclebulging arms damped around the trooper in ribcracking clinch
They swayed black and gigantic in the eerie fore light and from the taut straining agony erf that cdinch burst an appalling cacaphony of bestial sounds of growls and vicious snarls
shrill piercing squeal forced by un endurable pain frem strong mans Ups galvanized Leila into action
She dreped to her knees searching frantically in the meshed baffling underbrush for Stans gun
The tumult of that eerie battle in creased behind her chattering mind less scream signalled that Stan had got heme telling blow
PRIESTESS OP MURDER Run Leila the man yelled
Get iway
cant hold him The girl twisted saw Calban momen tarily driven away from Stan closing in again
Her lover met the renewed attack by ferocious uppercut exploding from crouch
His fist landed on the monsters jaw with the blast of rifle shot his other fist crashed against the brutes chest
The devastating blows might have been Ricks of flys wings for all the effect they had
Calban was not even staggered
His huge paw closed on Corbetts neck engulfing it with its vast span
His swarthy other hand drove for the mans groin
Somehow thick stick was in Leilas hand and she was hurling herself shrill ing primitive fury at the monster
Her improvised club pounded against Calbans forehead
He roared with anger rather than pain and the hand that was reaching for Stans groin flicked sidewise instead
It struck Leila in midair catapulted her backward crashing her into the threshing cushion of bush
Jarred and halfstunned she saw Calbans attack focus again on Stan saw her lover swept from his feet saw him lifted high above the grisly creatures head by straining arms shaggy with beasts black hair
The terrible tableau etched itself on Leilas mind
The gorillalike brute his bestial ferocity the more horrible for the fact that he was no beast but man de graded obscenely decadent poised mo mentarily motionless as he gathered his forces for the throw that would smash Stan to pulp
Above his head Stan was as motionless rigid and helpless in the gigantic grip of Calbans leathery hands at armpit and crotch his face contorted and pallid his eyes staring in agony
TR an eternal moment that awful pause persisted
And then the lurid gleam of Calbans beady savage eyes flared more redly and the muscles in his huge arms writhed snakelike beneath their hairy skin and Leila knew that in the next instant they would sweep downward
From somewhere whistle shrilled high and piercing through the quivering terror of the woods
It came again the strange high sound that once before Leila had heard through black clouds of death swirling about herself
It froze Cal ban to an astounding paralysis leashed him as though it were chain writhing about his savage limbs
Leila could almost see the deaththought seep unwilling from the black and terrible frame
Calbans protest was grisly roar blast ing through the black forest aisles
The huge arms bent slowly reluctantly let ting Stan down
The trooper twisted abruptly freed himself from Calbans loosening grip
He thudded to the ground sprang erect snarl ing
But the monster was gone had fJunged away into the veiling thickets
For minutes the lovers heard the threshing of his huge evil body moving away and then sinister silence close about them
silence sinister because it cloaked not only the ravening manbeast but another mysterious entity lurking invisible be ing who was master of the Monster whose whistling command the brute obeyed even in the height of his frenzy
Twice Leila had heard the weird whistle twice it had saved her
Not her but Stan
It had been at Stans approach that the ravening human hound had been called away tliat first time it had been Stan whose deadly peril had just now been averted
If it were not for Stan God the youth groaned
Who is he
Where did he come from He pulled trembling hand across his bruised fore head above his glazed unseen eyes swayed with exhaustion
Why did he quit just when he was about to slam me TSRRCnt TAUSS down ssd facreak kme in bof LeUa struggted out ds ngtoig bu which Caibtfi hd flung her

The angling wound across his riba from whidi the gory airy fluid gued was no knife slash
It was the jaggededd path of bullet and under the fresh scarlet pour yfs the Bttss of aa dd Leife
ripped hasty bandage from the tatters to which her own frock had been rtucd worked frantically to staiA ttwt grisly flow
And as rfe wrfced vague estplanation of what ld happeied formed in her mind
Hfes mad fathers bulkt had ploughed across Stans ribs had ffia him down uiKtMiscions at the foot of the stairs
Tlw slow seepe had stopped itsdf
He had come awake
Hearing what he thought was Leila running out of the house he had fcAlowed
His wcertions the battle with the apefaced monster had opened die wound afresh
Weakened by the new loss of blood he had fainted once more
Now he lay here unconscious in the black depths of the forest
He lay bwe and she with him and somewhere in the glimmering caninous shadows Calban atHl roved and
Leilas tseck pridded abruy with tibe sense of eyes upon her of glaring hostile eyes
Leave rustled stealthily
Sie crouched low over Stands senseless form throwing the frail protection of her bt body wart him and quivered with the kn we that eut of the tmuk eneny was creeping silentiy to le upon her and destroy her
tTX leap upon her
ft was she Lea ALonroy the unseen adversary threat ened not Stan
Stems danger lay only in toat was wito him
Twice that had been proved
If she cotdd lead the chase away from Stan
She leaped from her lovers recumbent form
Come and get me she cried and was hurtfing once more through the lashing tearing brambles of the woods
Was run ning headlong and blindly through the shadowed aisles not knowing where she ran not caring so Icaig as it was away from Stan so long as led the destroyer away from the man she loved
The forest crashed into sudden life be hind her
Some one was following her was flinging after her hollow echoing shout
Its direat spurred her to renewed efforts
Despairing fraaticv guping fear goaded girl catapulted through the tearing brambles crashed into stunning tree trunks catomed oE and ran on
And then
uUe suddenly LeHa was of the farest
She was nmniag down wet but grasssoft stope and before lier across the familiar pastore was the yellowwindowed bulk of lier own hou Uack apiast sky tinted by the haunting gray of false dawn
Aknoet at once she was in lr own back yard was leng the backporch steps was tugging at the knob of friend ly kitchen door
It resisted her efforts
It would not open
She gasped remembering that she bad herself iodtod it from toe ktside
PRIESTESS OF MURDER Unhqjed for safety tantalizingly offered at the last moment was snatched away
Leila whirled to meet the fate from which she had fled
Silver of the setting moon sluiced an empty field
No one nothing was there
She had outdistanced her invisible pur suer had left him behind in the forest
Or had he fooled her as she had thought to fool him
Had he left her flee ing blindly through the woods while he turned back to pounce upon and destroy the lover she had planned to save by her rejected sacrifice
Something moved there in the ribbon of darkness that was the forestedge across the fields
Something moved and came lumbering out into the brooding lunar luminance
twoheaded grotesque monster it came slowly inexorably out of the shadows
Gelid fingers clutched Leilas throat
What nightmare thing was this what awful spawn of the dark forest
The porch floor heaved beneath her feet threw her back against the paint peeled door
It wasnt there
She fell backward through it fell against warm feminine figure
Whats the matter Eve Starr ex claimed
Where have you been Dose the door Leila screamed
Close it Somehow she was on her feet again had her hand on the wood of the portal
She threw single terrified glance through the opening And checked the closing panel
Nearer and distinct now in the silvery light she saw what it was that had come out of the woods
Saw Stans lolling pallid face
Saw that he was leaning heavily on the shoulder of another man
Of her blood was black flood in her veins of Foster Corbett
Of his grizzled father who she thought lay dead at the foot of West Qiffs high parapet
She knew now who was Calbans mas ter
She knew now whose high shrill whistle it was that had twice drivoi the monster from his prey to save Stan Corbett CHAPTER FIVE Into tbe Grifly Night EILA Eve cried
Why is your door broken down and the place upset
Whats scared you so Leila Monroy twisted to her fell back in astonishment
The girl whom last she had seen with few shreds of torn cloth ing fluttering from her lacerated almost naked form was fully dressed her hair carefully arranged no signs of the wild night about her
saw your lights come on after the storm and came over to see if anything was the matter
found Eve cut off as stumbling feet pounded on the boards outside the door as Foster Corbett staggered in with his greyfaced limp burden
Mr Corbett
In the name of all thats holy whats been going on here Never mind now the older man grunted
Help me Leila jumped to his side
To gether the three lifted Stan from his wav ering legs carried him in to the living room where hours ago Leila had cringed from the whispered lash of fancied voices and laid the youth on the couch there
Stan groaned his lids flickered open
Where where Dad His eyes lighted up
Leila You youre both here
Both all right Fairly all right son the old man an swered
There was black bruise on his brow another on his check
His clothing was smeared with the brown loam into which he had fallen his shoes were packed with it Otherwise he seemed unhurt
His TASSS Ueamt brooding gaze fteaed an Leila slid to Eve weat twk to Stan
Well do
But you need doctw
Ill call No Stan sboved himself up to sitting position and Leila winced as his face twitetod wit the pain of the effort
Im kind of frayed at the edges but IB tart
Tm Itae Eve
wutt to know wltfd this ta all atawt Leila started to spesdt but the old man beat her to it
Wed an fike to know that Stan
Sup pose you give us your story first He was starting wrong end to Leila thought There was reason for that
He was conoeating sometiikig
Of course he was concealing something
He was Cal bans master
Kc was die moving force behind aU the terrible evente of Ae night and he wanted first to hear how much the others know before he ceacocted his own stery to fit
She wiridol interfere
Shed keep quiet and give hia rope eimugh to liang himself and then
But Stan was tafidng
tried to get to Leila after the Iwti but she was gone by the time managed to shore through the crowd
saw Eve though told ho to Leila Id come to her as soon as my tour of duty was over
The storm eaug me as came up ffte road
Leilas lights were all on
heard seren from the house and she didnt answer when knocked on the door
That scared me
went frantic started to batter down tte door
The lights weat out Just as it gave way
ploughed in yefiiz for her
The lightning showed me she wasnt on the lower floor
started up the staks
heard her scream again
shot jabbed me
It seared across my ribs jolted me off balance
guess must have gone down on my head and knodced myself out because ffM noct thing knew it seemed long time after heard the door dose ami her nmmi into woods Leilas eyes Sicked to Eve
The girl was listening openmouthe did
not in terrupt to correct Stans misapprehension
That was queer
Queer as her evident ig norance of all tlmt had happased to her or had seemed to have hamened to her
If she had lain
aatntly dead on the bed above if she had run screatmng in terror of Leila herself ffiroi the woods how couki she be so nea dresd so uadtatmibed
The awful dibt of her own reason closed in once more on Leita with ks nameless fear
Tinaeceuntably ttie brute chipped me and and fainted again from loss of Wood Stan fitirehed
Then you were bending over me
Dad Mfere hrfpii me up
How about you Leila Fortw Cor bett tamed to her
Whats your end of the story TTIS eyes bored into her and in their rheumy depths she saw littie light of triumph crawl
If she answered she must convict herselfof eer incredible madness
Of madness
How coidd she tell of filing Eve apparaidy dead of the strange scene of her terror in the woods when the girl hersdf was so calm so tm perturbed so evidently ignorant of it that
How could confess to the at tack on Stans father
Her month opened dosed again
She swayed put out gromig hand to the arm of chair to keep hwsdf fni fall ing
And Eve ame to her rescue
Cant yon how weak she is Mr Corbett the darkhaired girl indignandy exdained as she jumped to Leilas ude ami hdped her into the diair
She cant talk But weve got to get at the bottom of this thing Corbett insisted
Tires tOBMtbtng damn queer goii on PRIBJBSS GB MtetDBR Seem to tm youve gat sy tvt Eve countered Why doot yeo Had the same thought occued to her too LeUa wtHtdered that the man had taken charge of the aituatloa in order to coec up his own guilt
How come you were out there in die woods at this time of the morning Yes Dad
Stan put in
Thats puzz ling toa Ctebett made peculiar UtUe gesture with his gnarled hands as of defe cant hrip nuidi he said
But Ill tell what know
When the storra feffobe thoght of Leila and looked out of window to try and see she were alone over here
The lightning struck into that line of poplaas betweoi our farms
saw some one among them just at the spot where we found Shean Rourke dark crouching figure watching the Monroy house
There was somhing ksdescrih ahly nKnaeing in his pose and it flashed oil me diat perhaps we had been all wroig aboot Justins beiri Rourices murderer that perhaps diis was the real kfllcr and toat new he was after Leila
He rted moving in the moment glimpsed him dodging low the high grass of the pasture
lost sht of hhn
ran to the phone to warn Leila
just had time to tell her to lode her doors and windows when the wire went dead
snatched up my gun ran out to cone to her aid
Her lights were going on saw her shadow going from window to window pulling dw screens across them
And tten saw the fellow Id spotted before
He had climbed to the little roof ewer the kitchen porch was sliding into window up there
knew that because of ray own warn ing Letk wonld not open the door to me
By the time got her to understand the prowler woidd catch her would kill her
My orfly course was to go after him the way he had entered try to ca him be fore be did any demse
The sflm redoubled in violeiice and am an man
tetJc me hours it seemed before managed to get to tiv house before managed to climb tip to diat snudl slanting roof
heard muf fled scream from icsnk as gcA into toe room up toere heard damnal paadc motilum gmng an
The room was pitdi bkde and minute passed before found toe door sxtd got out into the halt Just as did so the door crashed in behtw
twisted to the stskway htd some cie shout down there as he came in could not make out the words
Then reccnized Stans voice and in the same instant some one screamed behind me
Some one screuned and bkxk form surged at me from somewhere behind struck me
The blow jted my finger that was preseiflg the trigger tl gun and fired the shot
whipped around time to see that same dark gfrotesque form pounce on Leila and carry her ofiF
shouted did not dare shoot for of hitting her
The invader hurtled along the corridor dived kUo room at the very end
went after Win yeHing for Stan was out dad and didnt hear you So know now
That rowi door was jammed and by the time opened it the chamber was empty
But the window was open and torough it saw the kidnaper vanishing into the wood Leila on his shoulder
saw that he must have climbed down rainspout that passed the window but didnt dare follow that way
The head of the back stairs however was at this end of the corridor
ran down them out through the back door ain across the fields and into the forest where had seen the fellow vanish
In the storm couldnt trail him
shouted fired off my gun in the hope Leila woidd respond
In vaki
Then the TERROR TALES storm was over as suddenly as it had begun
The clouds started to break
Moon light sifting through showed me tram pled bushes shreds of girls clothing caught on briars
followed that trail reached the face of West Cliff
Just above where the spoor ended saw the mouth of cave thought sensed movement within it
Possibly thought my shots had scared the kidnaper away and Leila was alone up there
started to climb up to it
Suddenly rocks started to fly down at me
One struck me on the head
felt myself falling struck and lost con sciousness TT FITTED Leila thought his story fitted
Was it the truth or tissue of lies
Somehow it explained everything too patly everything except who the Mon ster was and where he had come from except the mystery of Eve Starrs weird part in the dreadful night
Eves face was an expressionless mask her unfath omable eyes fixed on Corbetts seamed horribly tired countenance
When came to heard the sounds of struggle faroff
pile of dead leaves had cushioned my fall wasnt badly hurt
staggered to my feet ploughed tlirough the woods and found Stan knocked out Or had he come on that scene just little earlier in time to whistle off Calban in time to send the Monster ravening after her through the woods
Was he playing still for chance to get her alone to finish her
The speculation wrenched groan from the bemused girl
Leila Eve exclaimed
Youre white
You look as though you were going to faint ni get you some water She was out of the room as her sen tence ended
The kitchen door swung closed behind her
Leila Foster Corbett spun to her
What do you know of Eves actions to night
Have you seen her scream sliced across her amazing question scream from behind the kitdi en door
Corbett slewed around
Gun in hand he hurled himself across the room pounded that door open
The brickwalled room beyond was starkly gruesomely va cant but the back door was just slam ming shut and from beyond it thin high wail of infinite terror told where Eve had vanished
Hes got her now the old man yelled
was wrong
Come on Stan And then he too was gone into the grisly night
CHAPTER SIX Monster at Play EILA MONROY came up out of her chair fighting the intangible but cloy ing threads of her weakness fighting giddy nausea that whirled within her skull and tweaked at the pit of her stomach
Through that dizzy whirlpool she saw Stans vague form dart past her lurched to follow it
The room seemed to whirl about her as she moved there was wall where the door should be wall into which she jolted
Halfstunned she pawed at the parti tion found the door away from which she had reeled in her vertigo reeled through
The kitchen place of black threatening shadows danced about her
She staggered across it stabbed at the outer door missed it pulled in an agoniz ing breath and tried again
This time Leila contrived to grab the doorknob as it went by and steadied her self by it
Gripping the jamb with her other hand she fought to get the porta
open succeeded
Something lay black unmoving bulk on the porch outside
It must be PRSSIESS ffSVRDER Stan her bemidered alded at her and she went to her knees beside it
Sbe pijed
at it her durred visimi stiH re fumg to clear
The bo cfone suddei alire
Rled over
The apdit ferodous vag of die Monster glared at her Uack curling aw from jreMow fangs la strange jabbering laugh of bestial tri umph
scream sUced her throat and then Calhans gigantic arms flawed around her crushing her to him crudung
her ribs clamping tha scream to sileaoe ia her breathless lue
He surged to his fed bringing her with him as though she had no weight at all
He lidched beck into the house with her
Throik the kitchen the Uric room he ploughed chudding lewd glee
Into the foyer he sliouldered the piggish little eyes under his beetling brows lurid with an obscene light his calloused rasping fingers writhing as though with sane vile life of thek own on her shrinking quiv ering flesh
Leilas larynx swells
once more with shriric but Celban caught her intention by some unhuman secondsight ami gagged her jged her horriMy with the pressure of his slobbering evU lips on hers in kiss of ulrimate horror
Crushed thus in the visehke cradle of the beastmans arms gaed thus by his insuflfierable caress Leila knew that he was carrying her up the broad stairs to the passage above
To the passage where her own room was her onmt bed No doubt now no doubt at of what the bruteman intended
No doubt of what he intended or of what had happened
He ld been waiting outside had grabbed Eve and killed her probably
Foster Corbett had taken ad vantage of the girls one cry to get out of the way hunself to get Stan out of the way and had sent back his creature to finish off Leila
Stans unlocked for pres oice time and tsne again had interfered with his macaber jdans but SSan was out of the ymy now id Lrila was in Cal bans power being carried up to the room where the mghts horror had begun and now would be consummated
Calban was the room thrusting the doew sl with doKtrouB foot as he passed thrm iL twisting to the bed with swift surety that told of curious famili arity with its locion
Even in that ter rible moment Leila noted that noted that her white snead was rumpded and blood flecked that the indenmtion of contorted figure stifi visible on it Then Cal ban had flm her shmniiy down on the bed had pihned her to it with digging cruel knee as he tore avidly at what was left of her clothing
Pre he jabbered as he had jab bered before in the forest
Cat ban likes He paid to oat over the quivering beauty his violating paws had revealed
Calban likes very much Leilas tortured eyes fled from the evil antietpm of his thlcHpped drooling mouth slid past the musdes of his terri ble arms
Her hopeless gare id akmg the walls of fauniUar room that now was ceil of ndness and despair reached the door
It was evening
Slowly silent ly it was oponing and white fingers joed its edge
The girls heart leaped
Please she whimpered pulling her gaze back to her tormentor
Please Cal ban let me go At all costs she must distract his attentiwi keep him from no tiedng the advent of her rescuer
pay you
Ill give you lots of money jewels
The Monster gibbered his mindless laugh
Calban no want money jewels
Calban want pretty wanan white soft flesh of pretty woman
Ijke this And suddenly he leaped away from her reRROR TALES leaped to the center of the room and whirled to the opening door
Some sixth sense had warned him of danger
CTAN jumped into the room long carving knife in his hand that must have come from the kitchen below
Leila he yelled
Run jump out of the indow
can hold him long enough Calban roared plunged at him
Stan met the attack with darting slash of the knife caught the Monster across the knuckles
The beastmans other fist crashed against the troopers shoulder slaTiimed him against the wall
Leila screamed started up from the bed
Calban twisted to her
flick of his long arm pounded her back to the creak ing mattress
Stan rebounded from the wall sliced at Calban
The giant sprang backward avoiding the rush dropped to the floor and rolled toward the trooper
Leila was out of the bed was darting once more toward the window
Black digits closed on Stans ankles heaved upward
The trooper was flung high into the air
He twisted Hthely came down on his feet crouched to
meet his snarling ad versarys lunge
Calbans juggernaut rush swerved at the last instant and the girl felt the impact of his fists once more blasting her headlong away from at tempted escape
She sprawled brought up thumping against the wall
Stan ducked forward slashed long cut across the others leathery cheek
Cal ban squealed more in rage than pain and exploded into swift blur of action which Leilas eyes could not follow nor Stan avoid
Suddenly that whirling bat tle was static terribly static Stan hung from the giants tight clutch on his wrists hung from arms stretched horizontally out from his shoulders in that terrific grip
Crucified on an invisible cross the troopers body was taut arc of suffering his face fishbelly white sweatwet mask of hideous tor ture
low moan squealed from his rigid throat squealed into sound
Get out Leila your chance gurgled into nondescript gust of agony as Calbans gargantuan span of whipcord muscle widened to crack the bonejointures in his shoulders with the gruesome power of its living torturerack
Leilas way to the door was clear as long as Calban held the straddlelegged pose he must to continue his grisly tor ment of her lover
This was her chance to escape
She shoved away from the Wall to which that last fierce buffet had flung her came up to her feet
Came up to her feet with the light bedroom chair in her hands leaped toward Calban and pounded the improvised weapon down on his head
The chair splintered smashed
Calban let Stan drop and whirled to Leila He was laughing actually he was laughing
Shedevil his twitching Ups spewed
Calban like you that way His hands lashed out his fingers dug into the girls shoulder sent fiery agony darting through her twisting almost nude body
Calban like woman that can fight but cant play now
Must finish with man first
Tear arms out legs like flys wings No Leila screamed
Leave him alone
Do what you want with me but leave him alone ALBANS simian visage was distorted by his yellowtoothed imbecilic grin
Calban do what he like with both She was helpless infantile in his great hands as he flung her once more on the bed as he ripped the sheets into strips and lashed her ankles her wrists lashed them tight ly cruelly pulling the knots with sadistic violence
The rough edges of the tom linen cut into her shrieking flesh were scarletedged with oozing blood
PRIr OF MURDER On the floor behind the sava giani Img fodder ran through Stan Corbetts crunip itame and be was crawling raKing as steppedupoii ltle might in wtuxn life was yet te eKtinct
But unhke flt btle the man moved with definite purpose yard beyoid his sh UooiUess hand lay the knife he had dropped
yard to his anguish en feeSed body dt yaid was an infinite ds tacee
But if he could reach that knife
Leila seeing stoppered in her throat the momjs of her own agony sought to wrench from her and contrived question to hold Calban long enough for Stan to succeed
What will your master say if you harm him
Your master doesnt want you to
Cdban have no master the brute roMed rage flaring into Ws little eyes
No cmc tell Calban what must or must not do
Dismay pierced Leila as he twisted away from her as he lurched toward Stan whose scrabbling fingera were still mdies away from the Inirfe
No one The whistle shrilled in the whistle that twice before had saved Stan
vague figure blotted the windows dim rectangle
Mr Corbett Leila screamed lies killing Stan
Calbans killing CHAPTER SBVm Bargain with the Rend TT WASNT Foster Corbett who came surging in tlirough the aperture
It was Eve Astoundingly it was Eve
Cal ban she yelled
The whisfle hadnt stopped the monster this time
He was lifting the lacerated almost unconscious man from the floor by one hand and his ofler was at Stans diroat
Eve cried again
Stop it The gnt msed
Over the limp lolling frame of his vidam he ghoed at the dark haired ghiy his face gargoyiesqiK de nuxniac visage
No he chattered
Calban will not be cheated any more
Calbaa will tdll the man and take the woman your ties will net stop him aiu
not lie to you
Gro tesque hideeua this cofloquy between the slim daridybeautiful girl whom Leila Monroy had known all her Kfe and tire beetlebrowed barrelchested savage who was an atovism from the very dawn of time
It was you who foigot our bar gain and tried to force from me what promised would be yours when you fin ished the task set you
If you hadnt attacked me choked me Oh Godt It was blasphemous even to think his name in the presence of that woman
You you fiend Lefla burst out
You brwigtrt him here to kill me
You Eves glance flicked to her and it ung Leila aa if evil in it were barbed whiplash of frozen sted
Shut up she hissed
You dont count now Then she was concaitrating on the giant
Calban she pleaded tet him go
Let him live
Lurid htwems crawled siuisteriy in the brutes small eyes No he gnintwi and his throtdmg fillers started again to close bit by cruel bit on Stans throat No
You want him and youll never give yourself to Calban while he lives Tlmts it is it
Eves cry was ab ruptly hollow whisper of defeat
Thats what must pay to save him
Here then Calban
Her hands flew to her throat her fin gers fiT led at the high lacy collar tliat veiled it
Then the flimsy silk was rip ping as those white lands tore down TERROR TALES through it ripping away from her chest the creamy heaving rounds of her de sirous breasts the taut quivering hollow of her abdomen
The shredded fabric slid down the long line of her thighs reached the floor and she threw out her arms to the beastman in an abandon of seduc tion noisome as the uttermost depths of Hell and glorious as Heaven itself
Glori ous because whatever the woman was whatever evil had driven her she de scended now into Hades to save the man she loved
The man she loved
In that moment the whole story was clear to Leila
Eve loved Stan and Calban whimpered
He let his victim fall
He lumbered uncouth shaken by the tempest she had aroused within him to the naked alluring form of the tempt ress luminousseeming in the moonlight glow
His black arms slid around that voluptuous form
By some accident of the inscrutable fates Stan had dropped right atop the knife he so futilely had struggled to reach
His twitching bloodless hand closed on its hilt
Eve moaned shudderingly as Calbans shaggy arms enfolded her That moan seemed to explode in Stan with sudden spasmodic strength
He lifted to his knees flung the knife
Point first it was silver flash streak ing the moonlight and then it was black excrescence quivering from the middle of Calbans back
Blood spurted
The monster squealed with the sudden pain
His great hands gripped the woman they had been fondling flung her from him in paroxysm of rage
She catapulted into the wall
The crackling thud of crushing bone sickened Leila
And then the bound girl was screaming in terror for her lover as the wounded beastman whirled and plunged ferocious ly at the trooper who was swaying on his knees was toppling over from the effort alone of throwing that knife
Calbans writhing fingers closed on Stan
Thunder crashed in the room
It was the thunder of Foster Corbetts gun
blaz ing from the doorway
Long orangered jets of flame seared across the room
Cal bans great form jolted to the impacts of the lethal lead once twice
He collapsed like ripped meal sack rolled over near his intended victim quivered and was still
Foster Corbett came in
He was mud covered from head to foot blue bruise blotched the seamed gray of his face and one trouser leg flapped grotesquely some how in two disjointed halves
But the mans old tired eyes glowed with strange satisfaction
You gals sure can play hell he growled when you get to fighting over boy He picked up the knife and sliced Leilas lashings then bent to his sons flaccid form
Is is he Leila dared not finish the question but Corbett understood and answered it
Hes just knocked out and hes coming out of it now
Hell be all right by noon imagine right enough to stand up with you in front of the par son and He wouldnt marry me now Leila moaned
He wouldnt marry the daugh ter of madman Madman hell Corbett grunted swinging around to Eves crumpled moaning body
His gnarled fingers probed the girls hurts with curious ten temcss
Then Im afraid youre through Eve he said
Maybe things will be little better for your soul where its going if you tell Leila yourself
White lips moved in face that was agony incarnate

PROBAKjumior Tke DEVILS EMISSARY Sinisterly handsome was the stranger who brought secret gift to the girl whose dark beauty matched his own
Whence had he come
To what dank place would he soon return bringing his victim
Frances Bra Mklciletoii Author of Deatht Pagm idocktry ftej
ll day long had been hoping against hope that young Philip Rice would reach Palo Alto Plan tation House by supper time
For full year we had heard nothing from him had almost ven up any expectation of ever hearing from him jin
So my old heart was set fluttering bit by that per emptory knock and went to the door myself
Birt when reached it old Jude had already opened it
caught glimpse of Bob Shane the only taxi driver in the THE DEVILS EMISSARY county as he hurried down the graveled walk toward the gate
Only glimpse for he was almost out of sight behind the jasmine bushes and my old eyes had been drawn as by magnet to the stranger who stood in the doorway looking into the gathering shadows of the hall
cant describe him
He was tall and slender and dark with face of free wild beauty
His eyes were black that black which is total absence of light and when they looked at me was lost in them com pletely filled with that insane desire which comes to some men on the sum mits of high places the desire to hurl oneself over the parapet to the ground be low
For with all his beauty and grace there was about him something dreadful sometliing terrifying
If you will pardon this intrusion the stranger began
And his voice matched the rest of him
It was low and vibrant
At the sound of it felt an icy hand close hard around my heart
bring me mento from young Philip Rice the voice was continuing
left him down south there He made curious gesture with his long slender beautiful hands
Never had seen such hands as his so sensitive so capable
am an old man and shocks are bad for me
stood there gasping
ND then quite unexpectedly he smiled and knew at once that my fears were foolish
could see that he was just an extraordinarily handsome man who was asking hospitality at door which for more than hundred years had refused hospitality to none
Come in begged in confusion
The place is crowded and Im afraid must put you in Sherburne Rices room spoke hesitantly for we never use that room at all
It has been called haunted room ever since Sherburne Rice the Second hurled man out of it and down the north stairway to the death of broken neck in the garden
But this was All Hallows Eve when all of us gather to celebrate tbe date of the houses building
Every room but that was full and was imwilling to thrust so strange guest upon any of my kin
He smiled queerly
am sure shall be at home there he said
My name is Minos Dis and come from strange far country
As said have brought remembrance from your kinsman Philip Rice For me asked
admit my voice was eager
Young Philip had occupied the limelight at the family gathering last year
He was an explorer with an already brilliant and bewilderir history in spite of his youth
Again the stranger smiled that strange haunting extraordinary smile
do not know yet for whom it is in tended he answered and his voice though low and very very quiet had something dreadful in it some hint of doom unthinkable
have come to learn And is Philip He made slight gesture with one per fect hand
It silenced me as if those slen der fingers had dosed around my throat
shall tell you all presently was all he said
myself led the way upstairs to Sher burne Rices room
did it reluctantly but could see nothing else to do
And yet somehow as opened the door into that orderly but long disused room felt that there was certain significance certain fitness in ushering that man into that particular room
could not umler stand why should feel so but did
saw to his comfort and left him there in that feared and haunted room
And as walked away through the dim old hallway toward the stairs the mans strange and foreign sounding name kept TERROR TALES echoit through my mind
It had some how faint familiarity
Had that not been the name of fabled king of Crete
straie name and strange man who laid claim to it surely
But then our hoise has Icmg been used to strange ness and to heartbreak and to dread
It is an cdd house pioneer house built solidly and substantially of brick
There are heavy iron bars at windows
There is huge pantry behind the kildien and deep cistern under the floor
And its time its people have been thankful for tlKse thinga
For Palo Alto has dark and flameshot history
They say that pirate gold built it and that pirate and huecaneers tried tg raid it in the old days
And it is certain that withstood siege in thirtysix by Santa Anas men and grim and furious battle fought up and down hs stairways in sixtyfive
And more heroic still when one of its women was marooned there in the flood of ninety nine she fought off the hungry drirfc crazed blacks and saved herself and her two baby girls from horror indescribable
strong hard breed tfiose children of fearfully remembered Sherburne Rice who come back each thirtyfirst of Oc tober which is the date ifl the cornerstone to celebrate the building of our bouse
COMETIMES strange things hpen yet something always brii us to gether again tiio very fascinaticm per haps of the autre and the unpredictable
And our very terror urges us to make of it very festive occasion even riotous with all the Halloween trappings and old wine brought up from the cdlar where Rodney Rices wife was once walled up alive
At least we are always glad to see each other and we always make volant effort to be gay with games and dancing and laughter
But we were not gay this year
It was dusk when found Patricia Rice standing alone on the wide front gal lery watching the darkness inarch down the turgid river
And knew she was thinking of that time thirtysix years ago when the high ground the house stands on was an island in fortymilewide sweep of muddy swirling water and shft stood tliere alone
Patricia is an old woman now grave and sensitive and understanding woman and some people say little psychic at times
She spoke without looking at me
dont like it Jerry
Something is going to happen and its always queer things that ha in this house
awful things
Youre thinking of the old days told her
It isnt that altogether
can fed something
have as eerie feeling as when carried my babies into the burial vault out yonder to escape those mad dened blacks
Of course do ways remember too niuch when come here Jerry
cant forget that stood guard beside the bones of Sherburne Rice the Pirate and Sherburne Rice the Ter rible of Reconstnrction days
cant forget that it was the negroes terror of those very bones that saved me and my babies
But lived through horror too
And had to dll two men
It does something to you Jerry gves you cert power
And tell you something horrible is hovering over us something more horrible than anything that has happened yet
wish young Philip Rice was on his way grumWed uneasily
Its been so long
But couldnt go on
And for while we stood in silence we who are old and who remember such strange things
As for Philip
THE DEVILS EMISSARY TTE HAD come to that year for the first time
Not one of us had ever seen him before
He had just got back then from an exploring trip into the heart of South America somewhere where white men had never been before
He had tried to fly over an inaccessible jungle he explained but the plane had crashed
He had come down in the outskirts of city as yet unknown to white men bewilder ingly lovely deserted city
His eyes grew rapt as he talked about it he seemed to be lost in memories
His own enthusiasm fired even our earthbound imaginations
He made us feel that place its unimag inable splendor its beauty its vastness its unthinkable antiquity
And as he talked he seemed to me to be the very quintes sence of the Rices to be possessed of all their charm their beauty their love of adventure and their valor without those darker qualities for which so many of them have been famed
loved the boy and hated the way his eyes were held by Moma Lane
tribe of Indians Mayas lived near the city he told us but they never entered it except for religious ceremonies and even then they barred him out
So he had to explore it by stealth taking his life in his hands at every venture within its sacred walls
He had stiunbled all by accident upon Mayan treasure house
The natives would have killed him if they had known
For these Mayas had rabid dread of white men
Around their fires at night they told strange old legends of the Con quistadors horrifying tales of pillage and torture and enslavement
There would never be another invasion of white men into their land they swore
Yet para doxically they had welcomed Philip of fered him membership in their tribe made of him sort of reincarnation of their Fair God
And could understand that looking at him down the table
He was one of those fortunates whom people love at sight
Certainly our whole family fell in love with him that night
And he
Well he fell in love with Moma Lane the step daughter of one of our many cousins
She was one of those fair girls whose beauty seems to shine to dazzle mens eyes
And she was captivated with Philip or with the things he stood for
Their eyes were locked together while he told his tale
She was breathless eager
And she begged him to go back
But you must she cried
Dont you see
You brought nothing out with you
You have no proof of your discovery
Go back
Get pictures and specimens and astonish the world
Bring me Mayan amulet Phil
Philip laughed and shook his head
He knew the danger you see
If he having been sort of god among the Mayas before his escape should now return
It made me shiver even to guess at his punishment
Besides the Mayas had been in the habit of sacrificing the incarnations of their gods
That old puzzling heathen idea that the essence of the human god must go back at stated times to keep the godhead strong was one of the funda mentals of their religion
No one knew that better than Philip
Yet he did return to his Mayan city
We heard about it later and the news had made my heart sink as if under leaden weights
am an old man and had loved that boy
And now some one had come wlio claimed to bring us news of him
But how weird and strange messenger
Yes believed with Patricia tliat something was going to happen
Something dread ful
Something far worse than merely strange
IOT one of the darkies would go to Sherburne Rices room to summon TERROR TALES our strair guest to supper
They made various plausibleseeming excuses but understood
They were afraid
So climbed the weary stairs myself stairs that had been tracked with human blood these many tunes
My liand tremUed little as knocked on Sherburne Rices door
That strange weirdly melodious voice bade me enter but did no more than open the door
The stranger stood bare headed in the lamplight
The unearthly beauty of him struck me with new force
My ey were so lost in that compelling gaze of his that was barely conscious of the box he held between his hands not large tox but extraordinary like everythit else about him
It had tlie look of having been made of single opal yet impossible as that seemed know that thought nothing of it at the time
He shook his head slowly at mention of supper beed to be excused
He would join us later he said
And such was the sprfi he had me under that cQuW inakE no protest though deep down in me was an almost paralyzing fear
guest who wmdd not eat our salt or brealt our bread with us was not that gurat truly to be feared
But as turned away from titat hated room queer chokedoff cry jerked my thoihts away
Terror lent me strength
hurried to Patricias door and jericed it open and lunged inside
She was stand ing by the hearth in the full light of the tall white candles on the mantel
Her face was ghastly wHte and she held both hands to her tiiroat
Her eyes had tiiat supernatural look they sometimes have
As cried out at her in terror she low ered Iter hands and turned to loc at me
Slowly her eyes regained their sanity
She swallowed hard
thought for an instant that some thing had me by the throat was throt tling me
she whispered shakily
dont know
If Sherburne Bice is walking it might be ghastly business Jerry
It would be like liira to want to avenge his kinsman if Her voice died in hoarse rattle in her throat
got Patricia downstairs someliow
DREARY buriness that aipper
One of our sudden northers struck the ace just as the meal was served
Before the fires could be built up to give adequate warmth the house was staridy cold
We were all shivering when we came to the loaded table
And the wind was crying in bmishees dirge through the leaves of the live oaks keoiing under the eaves aioimd the cornices of the old house
hound down in the quarters li fted his voice in the eerie howling that tells you death is passing
And the negroes moved on noiseless feet their dark skins grey their eyes wild their hands aquivcr with ter ror
And could think of nothing but young Philip Rice whose infatuation for an emptyheaded girl had sent him into what must have been unthinkable fKril and of the stranger who claimed to ame from lum mid of the cooleyed smiling Moma Lane who sat acnoss tiie table from me
We old folks sat about the fire in the back parlor after supper and listenal to the shrieks of the rising wind and told tales under our breatlj of the bloody deeds of Shelburne Rice the bucaam and of his grandscai Sherburne Rice the Second
And while we whispered of past terrors and bloody deeds the young petle danced in the big front parlor bobbed for apples looked in mirrors and had their fortunes tc
But their attempts at gaiety were futile
The bht of tlte strangers pres ence was on them too
It was midnight when the strainer came into the dim temjdight of the room wliere we were wmting
The box had seen in the haunted room iqstairs was in his THE DEVILS EMISSARY hands
It seemed to me that little chilly wind not bom of the shrieking norther outside came in with him
And the far away howling of the dog had now become an anguished maddened whine of fright
The music in the front room ceased
The young people crowded in witii us and sank down upon stools and cushions around the fire
Morna Lanes eager piquant face stood out startlingly iu the soft light
could not keep my old eyes away from her she seemed so excited so avid for the news that was coming
And suddenly knew that hated her
And the stranger stood in the wide door way between the parlors and looked at us with his unfathomable eyes
tYTOU all knew Philip Rice he stated quietly in his grave deep organ toned voice
He was kin to you Some few of us murmured in assent
Philip had been kin to all of us except to Moraa Lane
He went back to the village in the jungle the sonorous voiced rolled on
He must have known that death awaited him there yet he was driven by force he could not resist He paused and the silence was abso lute except for the soft crackle of the fire and tlie wind and the howling dog
He went back
Even then he might have escaped his doom if he had been careful for he had friends among the Mayas
They are remnant of once highly civilized and mighty race as yet uncontaminated by intermarriage with other breeds
Their great stone city is an amazing place
You would marvel at it if could make you see it
Where did the stones in its walls come from
They are huge and expertly cut
But what force brought them from their distant quarry what force lifted them to their destined places in the towering walls
No man knows
Unthinkable wisdom those long dead Mayas must have had unthinkable riches
Their ancient treasure house would make the richest treasury in your world look like beggars pittance
Gold and strangely wrought ornaments and glow ii gems
Why did Philip Rice persuade the Mayan girl who loved him to take him there
That place was holy
He knew it
What untumable force could have sent him there His black eyes moved from face to face and saw men and women sway backward as his eyes moved over them even as field of grain sways when wind blows over it
He took something exceedingly pre cious from that treasure house the stranger said very quietly
And his eyes came to rest on the opalescent box be tween his hands
saw Moma Lane lean forward just trifle as if to see it better
But her face was inscrutable
could make nothing of it
Could she have cared for Philip and still betray no sign now that he must be dead
The Mayan girl loved him with self less undemanding love
She helped him do the thing that he desired to do
She showed him secret pass through the hills
Because she loved him
Savage women are like that sometimes women to whom love is everything even though the loved one lias no thought for them as Philip certainly had none for her
His thought was all for the white girl who had sent him back
He was mad to get for her the bauble she de manded
And it was only through the native girl that he could get it so he took it and started home alone
And he might have escaped for the Mayas made no attempt to pursue him
They but sent messenger after him with the severed hand of the girl who had helped him
Come back and burn their message said or we burn the woman instead He did TERROR TALES not hesitate
He went back
And they gave his body to their gods pATRICIA screamed
think the rest did too
My breath stuck in my throat
was beyond the relief of any outcry
was stuni
The stranger watched us with his re lentless eyes tlwase eyes that were black with the blackness that is total absence of light
He lifted the priceless box that was neither large nor nall the box that seemed to be made of single firetinted opal in his perfect hands
This bring back from the jungle he cried pulse throbbir in his voice as the sacrificial drums must have throbbed in tile jungle while Philip died
It is meant for some one Itere
To whom does it belong It was beautiful that box
It glowed Ml tmbeJievable glory in the ligtit of the leaping fire
No rainbow in the world could ever have shown such colors colors that wrkhed and burned Mid faded and burned ain
But we drew tck frwn it in horror
It was accursed For all its beauty it was stained with another oolor that did not show
The color of Philips blood
It belongs to one of you the stranger said inexorably
saw Morna Lane lean forward sud denly
She gasped as swimmer might gasp on tlie brink of an icy plunge
Her hand reached out drew back reached out again
She tried to speak and could not
The stranger gave her long still look from his fathomless eyes
It is yours then he asked and his voice was husky and filled with deep vi bratioiw like die music that comes from the strings of bass viol
Still she could not speak
But she nod ded jerkily and swallowed hard and her outstretched fingers clenrfied and un clenched and clenched again in spasm of desire
He laid that lovely priceless thing with in their grasp
He turned slowly and walked away his head bent like man who was very tired into the front parlor and across it into the hall
watdied him climb the stair slowly and sadly and yet with an air of duty done
When he had passed from sight my eyes came bad to that room of silence
Only one of the group liad moved
Morna Lane was gone
The rest sat still whitefaced silent stricken
TN the morning went with weary plod ding feet to call our stranger guest to brkfast
It was late in the morning then but only few of the kin had come downstairs and they looked as if th had not slept
The wind still bowled
The hound was silent
Oid Jude Imd whis pered to me with tangled stammering tongue that during the niglit die dog had died of terror
My old hand shorfc as knocked on the door of Sherburne Ris room
There was no answer and shaking as in chill pushed the door open
There was no one in that haunted room
There was no sign that any one had ever been in it
Nothing seemed to have been touched
Even the bed was undisturbed
Even as be had refused to eat at our table so it seemed he had refused to sleep beneatli our roof
Slowly painfully stumbled down the stair
Never had felt so old and helpless and dismayed
Patricia took my arm in the lower hall and for the first time in my life was glad of womans help
Swnehow she got me to the telephone
After what seemed hours of fumblii got Bob Shane the taxi driver on the wire
When had he taken the stranger back to town
THE DEVILS EMISSARY But never brought nobody out to Palo Alto he bawled in exasperation
Nobody at all
Old Jude mustve gone plum loco
brought out small package that come by express an left it with that old dumb nigger at the door
Whats the matter with the old hellion any how couldnt answer him
The receiver dropped from ray nerveless hand
was sick but there was something had to do
That box gasped to Patricia
Weve got to find out what was in that box Morna isnt down yet Patricia ob jected
Most of the young folks arent
Up late last night you know It makes no difference mumbled
Weve got to find out Patricia
tell you weve got to find out saw her own face whiten
dont know whether her thougiit was the same as mine
never did know for we never talked about it afterward
But she helped me back upstairs and down the hall to the room that was Moma les
She didnt answer when we knocked and her door was locked
had to send for some of the men to break it down
And then wished could have left it locked till judgment day
can never get that picture from before my eyes
The opaline box lay on the night table by the bed
It was open and empty
Morna lay cold and quiet in her bed
Her white hands still gripped the wrist of severed brown hand that clutched her throat in desperate futile effort to wrench it away brown hand that had once been part of Mayan maid who had loved and aided Philip Rice
And Momas face That is what would almost be willing to give my immortal soul to forget
But forget cannot
And even as we stared spellbotind with horror the brown fingere relaxed their grip the hand fell to the pillow and lay still its work well done Sherburne Rice Patricia was bab bling hfterically over and over
The vegeance of Sherburne Rice But was not so sure
stood there thinking of the strange man who called himself Minos Dis the man who ate not and slept not in our house the man whom Bob Shane had not been able to see
And remembered then that Dis is another name for Pluto the god of the nether world and that Minos was one of the judges who rendered judgments there
But how could it be other wise

evening early for callers even in Blairfteld
Quick footsteps sounded on the back porch and the kitchen door banged open
John OMarra stood there for moment breathing quickly
Hello John The girls hands went TERROR TALES to her hair then smoothed the apron over her slim hips
wasnt expecting you this evening Didnt come to see you this time Eileen John OMarra made quick nervous jerk with his head
Wheres your dad In the living room look of sudden alarm spread over the girls face
Whats happened
Whats wrong Plenty John OMarra went through the small dinii room of the Gannon home with Eileen at his heels
Paddy Gannon Eil eens father big and barrelchested with black hair that showed no sign of grey was sitting beside table lamp reading his paper
His wife frail but brightlook ing was knitting at the other side of the table
Mr Gannon raised his eyes looked at John OMarras face and let his paper drop to the floor
Trouble eh Johnny Yes sir
Eddie Dwyer is trapped cavein Paddy Gannons voice became growl
How could that hap pen
looked that tunnel over just be fore sundown
Theres something very dirty going on Johnny He stamped out into the hall and got his hat
Eileen went over and stood close to her mother
The two women watched with fearful eyes as Paddy Gannon opened the drawer of the living room table took out white brassard and slipped it on his left arm
As they started out John OMarra said Ive got to get Father Doyle Mr Gan non
ril see you at the shaft Is there doctor there Yes sir
One of the boys got Dr Akers The noise of Paddy Gannons small car joined that of John OMarras for mo ment behind the house
Then they both roared out of the driveway
GANNON tightened her arm around Eileens waist
Trouble Eileen darlin trouble
Black days are upon us
Working the mines in the dead of the night sneaking the coal out in trucks that dont turn on their engines un til they reach the bottom of the hill
Fights with the ccnpany men
Now this secret society
The Silents they call them selves
Secret societies breed trouble
This is the third accident in two weeks
It seems as if curse has been put on the Blairfield mines Eileen interrupted her mother
Wheres Nancy Her mother blinked once or twice
Nancy went out right after dinner
suppose shes over at the Crowleys house
Eileen have you noticed anything strange about Nancy of late
Sometimes the child frigjitens me Eileens bright blue eyes looked into her mothers tired grey ones and she caught her lip between her teeth
Well you know how girls are when they reach eighteen
Theyre always hard to under stand at that But youre twentyone Mrs Gannon said
You didnt behave so strangely at her age
Sometimes the womans voice dropped to almost whisper some times feel that shes not my own daugh ter at all Hush mother Eileen patted the older womans shoulder
Im going out for little while
Do you mind Out Her mother glanced toward the window
But its starting to rain
Where are you going Up to the mine Now Eileen dont go up there
You know your father wouldnt like it
They dont want the women up there especially when theres trouble
There will be THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN rough crowd up there and besides youll get drenched Ill wear my slicker and rubbers and mind my own business Eileen said Ill keep out of their way
If you want any thing before come back Neil is upstairs doing his home work isnt he Yes like good boy
But wish you wouldnt go wont be long Eileen was pulling on her raincoat adjusting soft felt hat so it would deflect the rain from her face and neck
She opened the door on nit that was black with winddriven rain
There was group of score or so of men gathered armmd the mouth of the aft in the Blairfleld coal mines
Coal oil torches flared and sent out fitful down thfust flames hi the storm wind
The ring of faces around the entrance to the shaft was picked out in red and black lights and shadows
Mostly men because the women had bn forbidden to come
Eddie Dwjrers mother and sisters were there for it was Eddie who was trapped in the tunnel
Their faces were no less grimly expectant than those of the other watch ers
Paddy Gannon and the doctor and priest were in the shaft with the shift that was trying to dig through to Eddie Dwyer
No word was spoken in the wait ing huddle
Off to one side on slight rise made by dump pile two figures stood alone
The man was straight as pine tree dressed in rags and his long snowwhite beard was spread out on his chest by the wind so that it looked like white jacket
The girl was slender and she wore neither hat nor coat
Her black hair airled in the rain and her thin dress was so wet it clung to her every contour revealing figure beautifully and youthfully femi nine
She had lovely elfin face with large eyes that seemed to tilt up gently at the outer comers and her hair was blown back showing tiny ears that came to points at the edges
There was strange expression on her face as she stood there beside the old man heedle of the ele ments watching the group around the shaft
She looked like person who is witnessing pageant of rare beauty
Her lovely lips were half parted like cliilds in front of Christmas tree
The old man just stood beside her still and without expression
Standing there together they looked in the weird lit of the torches like the study of an inspired sculptor
piLEEN GANNON came up the hDl skirted the group at the mouth of the mine shaft and climbed the little rise to where the girl and the old man were standing
She seized the girls arm
Nan cy
What are you doing here
Standing in the rain widiout hat or coat
Youd better come home The whitebearded man turned his head once to look at Eileen then looked away again
Nancy Gannon turned her lovely young face toward her sister Oh Eil een
Isnt that beautiful picture
Those people huddled in the rain and torch light with their faces hard with worry and sharp with pain waiting waiting
It is so beautiful it fills me with de light makes me want to run and leap and sing
Nancy Her sisters voice was brisk
Eddie Dwyer is trapped in tiiere
Daddy is one of the men trying to get him out
He and the others might get cauglit in cavein before they can reach Eddie
Youre talking nonsense and youll catch your death of cold
Come home with me at once All right Eileen Naticy said slowly
But hate to leave such lovely sht
Good night Seamus OCallahan
Lovely like the little folk gathered around their fire waiting for one of their mates who has been trapped in the world and is late in coming Eileen twitched her sisters arm
Keep TERROR TALES still and hurry They had gone dozen paces or so when Eileen said Why do you talk to that old hermit Seamus OCal lahan
Everyone knows hes crazy
Peo ple will talk if they see you with him like that
Youve been told before Seamus OCallahan is not crazy Nancy said
He is gentle and kind man with sensitive soul
He sees beauty with eyes that others lack
He talks to me until too can see beauty If tell Dad youve been talking to Seamus OCallahan and calling it beau tiful that Eddie Dwyer got trapped in the cavein hell take strap to you even if you are eighteen Nancy shivered and started to walk faster
Her voice had quieter more normal pitch when she spoke this time
Im wet through
Lets hurry The two sisters were lying side by side in bed when they heard their fathers car come into the yard
They heard him stamp up the back steps into the kitchen
Mrs Gannon was up waiting for her hus band with pot of coffee on the stove
The girls could hear them talking in tlie kitchen right below the bedroom
Did you get him out Mrs Gannon asked
Yes Paddy Gannon rumbled
We got him out too late
Dead he was when we got to him
Too late for priest or doc tor
tell you Mary there is some thing very dirty about it all
Its not nat ural
Its like the place was bewitched
Three accidents without any reason or cause one after tlie other
For all the world as if there was black spell put on the place CHAPTER TWO Black Clouds piLEEN GANNON dropped off to sleep to dream of the grim tableau at the mine
Again she saw the huddle of anxious fearridden figures at the mouth of the shaft
No word or cry had been uttered at the shaft but Eileen dreamed that somebody cried out sharply
The cry came again cut through tlie veil of sleep
It seemed still to echo in the quiet house when Eileen sat up in bed fully awake
Nancy moved restlessly by her side but did not answer when Eileen spoke to her
Eileen leaned close and saw her sis ters eyes were shut and that she breathed like person in deep sleep
This time the noise was frightened wliimper and it came from the next room
Eileen slipped out of bed and pulled on her robe
As she went through the door to her young brothers room she switched on the light
Neil her ten year old brother was sit ting up in bed his eyes round discs of fright
He was still whimpering
What is it Neil Eileen approadied tlie boys bed
He looked at her without answering
Paddy Gannon came thumping into the room in his bare feet wearing an old fashioned flannel night shirt
Whats this
Was that you screaming son dont know the boy said slowly
dont know if screamed but was asleep and it was like as if somebody was holding light over me
Then some body slapped my face hard three or four times
Then the light seemed to go out and woke up Bad dreams Mr Gannon scoffed
Too much sweet stuff on your stomach No the boy protested
Somebody was really slapping me
can still feel my face sting Eileen leaned over the boys bed
Yes dad
His face is red just as if he had been slapped
Red and white welts Wrinkles in the pillow Mr Gannon rumbled
Go back to sleep Neil and dont let me hear any more out of you
THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN You frightened ur mother out of sound sleep
The hoy put his hand gingerly to the side of his face then slowly lay back
Yes sir
ClLEEN turned and went back to her room
She switched on the small bed lamp for ond
The faint smell of hot wax came to her nostrils
There was candle in pewter stick on the bedside table purely an ornament
But there was little pool of melted wax around the wick
The wick when she touched it was still warm
The candle was on Nancys side within easy reach of her hand
Eileen stood there looking down at her sister with strange halffright ened expression
But Nancys lovely faun lilffi face was wreathed in an innocent sleep smile
The neck of her nightdress was Awry ahowmg the white throat and the sweU of her breast
Half child half woman all lovely
Slowly shaking her head Eileen crawled back into her side of their bed
Nb no
It couldnt have been Nancy
She wouldnt have done tliat
But his face was streaked
And that candle was lighted only short while ago
Oh no
Not my sister Nancy
Its unthink able
The next evening Nancy was not home for dinner and the Gannons sat down without her
Prom time to tune Paddy Gannon looked at the clock and demanded sourly Wheres Nancy
Whats keep ing her dont know Mrs Gannon said at length
She must be over at the Crow Itys
cant think of where dse she could iie Paddy Gannon finished his second cup of coffee and thumped his napkin down on the table
Im going after her
What kind of conduct does she call that
Not commg trame to meals staying out by herself after dark wandering around
It seems you havent taught your second daughter the things she should know Mary
Its time took hand
He filled his pipe put on his hat and coat and stamped out
Oh dear Mrs Gannon breathed fearfully
hope she is at Crowleys
do hope she is Eileen patted her mothers shoulders re assuringly but there was serious cast to her pretty face as she carried the dishes into the kitchen
Mr Gannon had not yet returned when Paul Savage came to see Eileen
He was slim goodlooking young man with rather solemn expres sion
He dressed mudh better than most of the yoimg men of Blairfield
He was in the living room talking to Mrs Gannon when Neil came out to the kitchen where his sister Eileen was putting away the silver
That Paul Savage Is cnit in the parlor waiting for you Neil said
You dont like him do you Neil Eiken smiled
Aw hes dude
like John OMarra
Why dont you marry Johnny OMarra Sis
Hes rular and hes big shot in the Silents
Sshf Eileen put her finger to her lips
You shouldnt talk about that
You know it Huh Neil muttered
Everybody knows who the Silents are
Pops one of them
Thats why he dont like com pany man like Paul Savage coming around to see you
He likes Johnny OMarra too You keep still Eileen warned him
Or youll get yourself in trouble
She took off her apron and went into the living room Paul Savage rose from his chair
When he smiled he looked much younger
Would you and your nujther like to go to the movies
he asked
No Mrs Gannon quickly tJaen TERROR TALES added
Thank you Paul but want to wait for Mr Gannon
You and Eileen go
Come out in the kitchen Paul Eileen said
want to show you something NCE in the kitchen Eileen closed the door and faced the young man
Paul Im terribly worried about Nancy
Thats where Dad is now out looking for her
want to wait until he gets back
Shes been acting awfully strange of late Paul took her hand
Eileen why dont you stop worrying about your silly sister and listen to me
want to marry you Eileen Dont call her silly please Eileen begged
Im really worried As long as you must talk about her Paul said All right
People are begin ning to notice that shes well different
Shes the prettiest girl around not count ing you of course
Yet she scares the fellows away because she never wants to do the ordinary things
She wants them to go out and run in the rain with her instead of going to the movies
She doesnt talk like anybody in Blairfield
She could have any young man in town if she stopped being like that What are people saying about her Eileen asked
Paul Savage shrugged
Oh dont listen to gossip
Its you Im interested in Youre sweet Paul
But Im worried
Oh heres Dad now Gannons car came into the yard and stofd at the side of the house
The front door opened and Eileen and Paul could hear Mr Gannons voice
Well found her Mrs Gannon said mildly Where have you been Nancy dear drove all over town looking for her Paddy Gannon growled
And where do you think found her
In the grave yard thats where
was driving past slow thinking and worrying and heard Nancys laugh
hopped the fence and there she was sitting on tombstone in the dark by the side of newly filled grave talking to crazy old Seamus OCal lahan
The two of them perched there on headstone for all the world like two ghouls
And crazy old Seamus telling her mad stories about the Little Folk and the banshee and the leprechauns fairy stories Well now Mrs Gannon said placat ingly
Theres great many people aroimd here who still believe those things and youd not call them crazy
You said yourself there was black curse on the Blairfield mines
If there are evil spirits why cant there be Hold your tongue woman Paddy Gannon made threatening ges ture toward his wife
Nancy stood there watchii and listening with sort of pleased smile on her lovely young face
Mrs Gannon made helpless little ges ture and stopped talking
Havent troubles enough Gannon demanded
Trouble getting the coal out
Trouble with accidents that dont look like accidents at ail
Trouble with the com pany and the men
And then my fine young daughter spends hgr time in the evening in the graveyzud talking to mad hermit
Youre old enough to have done with that childish stuff Nancy
Look at you
Why youre youre woman Old Seamus tells such lovely stories Nancy said sweetly
If catch you talking to him again Ill take the strap to you Gannon thun dered
Ill take the back of my hand to you in the public street grown and all as you are
No Nancy said softly
Dont beat me
You would be very unlucky the rest of your days if you were to strike me THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN lriAT kind of talk is this Gaa non bellowed
He took three quick strides to pass between the table and his wifes chair to reach his daughter
His foot caught in the electric lamp cord swept the lamp off the table to crash heavily on the floor
In falling it had missed Mrs Gannon by bare inches
Gannon stood there with the wrecked lamp at his feet and for second his face was purple
Then the anger seemed to go out of him
That almost hit you Mary he told his wife
Im sorry for my clumsiness Nancy looked from her father to her mother and her face was calm and sweet
Im going upstairs to bed In tile kitchen Eileen Gannon turned to Paul Savage
You heard it
Sitting on headstone in the graveyard listening to crazy hermit tell stories
Paul Im so worried about tier
It isnt tliat she herself is crazy Im sure
Its just that some times she isnt Nancy at all
Mother and Dad dont Inrow how to handle her
Im afraid its up to me wish could help Paul said
But shes your sister
wouldnt be much ure
Im afraid Mr Gannon came into the kitchen stopped dead when he saw Paul Savage
Hahl So youre here are you Good evening Mr Gannon suKose you company men Gan non said deliberately are all pleased to hear that Eddie Dwyer died in cavein You dont understand Mr Gannon Paul explained
only work for the Company but know how they feel
They know go in there and take out coal and ip it out quietly by trucks
They know you have armed guards stand there while the men work
They could call in other armed guards and cause bloodshed
They dont because of the men in Blairfield worked in the mines for yrars and will work there again when things open up
But you work those shafts at your own risk
You know that Mr Gan non There has been lot of mysterious trouble lately Gannon said
suppose the company doesnt know about that either The company doesnt want trouble Paul insisted
When hotheads like John OMarra get excited they blame every thing on the company Johnny OMarra is loyal to his own kind Gannon said sharply
Hes trouble maker Paul answeral firmly
Things are bad enough without men like OMarra keeping things stirred up
If youre interested to know Gannon said slowly
look with more favor on Johnny OMarra than on another who was raised in Blairfield and went away and got fine education and came back to work for the company against Ids own kind
know you mean me Paul said
do work for the company
So did you for years as mine foreman
And when things pick up youll be working for them again unless there is serious trouble Thats not sol Gannon exploded
The company never intends to work Blairfield again and they hate to see us scrape few dollars out of it to keep from starving Paul Savage shrugged
Id keep check on Johnny OMarra Mr Gannon
Hes getting too big for his pants
Dont let him get you into an rthing youll be sorry for
From outside came the rattle of noisy car coming into the driveway
think thats John now Eileen said
Please dont start any unpleasaiitness John OMarra came in tlie back door said good evening to Mr Gannon and Eileen and nodded curtly to Paul Savage
He stood there awkwardly for moment
TERROR TALES Then his heavy black brows drew down and he said Mr
Gannon could speak to you alone
What have to say is ncrf for the ears of company spies Come with me Gannon invited
They left the kitchen and went into the living room
Johnny was just one of the boys working in the mine when things were good Paul said meditatively
Now with all this trouble hes getting to be person of consequence
The men defer to him and your father alike
If your father doesnt watch out hell be taking or ders from Johnny OMarra yet Trouble Eileen put her hands to her temples
The air is heavy witli it
Its like watching black cloud come rolling over the horizon She shivered
CHAPTER THREE Who Walks at Night
TANCY was sound asleep when Eileen retired
The older sister stood look ing at the younger girl for several mo ments before putting out the light
Nan cys face was so sweet and childishly free from lines
The black hair clustered around her temples and the lashes curled smudgeblack against the warm whiteness of her cheek
Eileen bent and kissed her sisters forehead very gently
In sleep Nancys lips curved
Eileen stretched out beside her sister but sleep was reluctant to come
She shifted position constantly but did it gently so as not to disturb Nancy
Even tually she dozed off fitful tense sort of halfoblivion instead of sound re laxed slumber
Suddenly she snapped out of her half conscious state and sat bolt upright in bed
She reached over and tried to touch Nancy
The other half of the bed was empty Smothering frightened exclamation Eileen switched on thebed light
Her sis ter Nancy was gone
Eileen sat there hands to her temples trying to think coherently
The house was silent as tomb
If she started to look for Nancy it would wake her father and mother
Then if Nancy had left the house there would be terrific scene
Paddy Gannon would go looking for his daughter and when he found her hed give her horrible beating
Not since they were children had their father struck either of them
But Eileen knew if her father discovered Nancy had left the house black rage would get the best of him
Eileen covered her own face with her hands
No no
wont wake them
Ill Ill just wait and pray
Shell come back
She must come back
HOUR that dragged like prison sentence then the clatter of car thximping on the front door
Eileen bounded from bed snatched her robe and ran down the stairs her heart pounding
Something has happened
Something has happened to Nancy Her fingers groped for the light switch and then fumbled with the front door latch
She had to cling to the door jamb to keep from surrendering to her trem bling knees and folding up on the floor
John OMarra pushed in his dark face pale and his eyes bright with strange frightened look
Wheres your dad In bed Eileen stammered
Is some thing wrong
Did something happen to Get him up John OMarras facial muscles jerked as he said each word
What goes on down there Paddy Gannon bellowed from the stair head
Its John OMarra Come down for Gods sake John shouted
The shaft is haunted
saw THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN it with my own eyes
Joe Dixon and were on the second level waiting for the bucket when all of sudden Joe says in scared voice Look looked and saw something white gliding toward us from the tunnel
Joe let yell out of him and stepped back and fell down the shaft
Hes killed
fired shot right at the ghost but it just disappeared You must be drunk or crazy No
saw it
Joe saw it too and thats what made him fall
While we were getting Joes body out another one of the boys saw it
white thing tliat seemed to floatalong in the dark tunnel
None of the boys will go back in the shaft Ill get dressed and be right with you Paddy Gannon said
Eileen stood downstairs in the hall clutching her robe around her
What did it look like this thing you saw
Could it have been woman or girl No
It was nothing human tell you
fired right at it You shot it Eileens voice was un steady
And it disappeared where Just disappeared John repeated
In to the blackness of the shaft Mr Gannon came clumping down the stairs his shoes not yet laced
He grabbed his hat and coat
Haunted His voice was scornful
Youd think you were bach hi the dark ages in Ireland After they had gone Eileen crept back upstairs to bed
She was trembling so she had to grasp the banister with both hands as she made the ascent
Once in her room she threw herself face down on the bed
Once more the house was very still The pounding of her own heart boomed in her ears
Nancy gone
white figure in the mine ghost
Joe Dixon hurtling to his death
John OMarra shooting point blank at the white figure
Nancy gone
The words and thoughts flooded her mind in confused and terrible jumble
She was afraid as she had never before known fear
Not fear of known thing something tan gible you see and understand and fight off but heartchilling terror of some unknown menace
VV HEN she awoke the sun was stream ing in her window and the little clock on the bedside table said six
She turned quickly
Nancy was lying there beside her breathing regularly sleeping like child
Maybe it was all horrible dreamt Then she saw red smear on the bed sheet that covered Nancys shouders
She drew back the covers
Nancys white nightgown was torn at tire right shoulder and under the tear crimson groove marred the flawless skin
Not deep but raw and angry looking
It might have been made by the branch of tree run into in the dark
It might have been made by the lash of whip or the sting of speeding bullet as it grazed its mark Eileen went quietly into the bathroom and got the iodine bottle
Nancys eyes opened as the strong an tiseptic seared the red flesh of the wound
She looked up at her sister and smiled sweetly
It doesnt hurt much Nancy Eileen leaned over her
Where have you been darling
What happened to your shoulder have been asleep right here beside you Nancy murmured drowsily
And had lovely dreams
Red lights in the dark underground and yellow lights and mens faces reflected
And one face so frightened the mans soul was stamped on it like the brand of whitehot iron
It was lovely
Then she closed her eyes again and slept
Eileen threw back the covers
Nancys bare feet were bruised and soiled with thick black dirt
Like coal dust
Gently Eileen covered her sister and TGRROR TAtBS tiptoed from the rcwMn
She had to get out into the air out and walk in the ain shine
She couldnt talk to her mother or father or little bner about diis ev increasing fear tliat was seeping into her bones
She left die house and walked quickly takii breaths As she reached Blairfielfs main street she saw little groups of people standing about talking excitedly
Only one or two of the stor had opened as yet but there were more people on the sidewalks than was usual at notm
They nodded good morning to Eileen as she passed then turned to rume their fevered discus sion
In front of the drug store there was larger group
Eileen stopped and edged into the fringe around an old woman who was talking in hi thin cackle and holding her listeners spellbound
The first sentence Eileen heard made her heart and still
Bewitched Yes
You dont believe it heh
But you must believe now
re member sixty years when Leadville was bewitched
Strare things happened and men dropped dead at their work
The whole town soon frit the curse
Men were afraid to work and they couldnt get any money
When they found the witeh they burned her
Then they could work again
Blairfield is bewitched
No man will set foot in that haunted shaft
Blarr field is doomed
bystander echoed the word stupidly
Yes ckiomed to waste and die
Doomed unless you find the witch
Eileen caught her lip between her teeth to stifle cry and walked quickly away
As she walked the words kept echoing in her mind
Find the witch
Find the witch The people of Blairfield were simple close to the soil
Many of them were only one generation removed from the peas ants of an old eoimtry whose lor was woven around strange tales of Little Folk and fairies and leprechauns handed down from the time of the Druidsnd so strongly part of their consciousness that centuries of Christianity could not eradi cate it
None among them would deny in his own heart that certain families had banshee an evil spirit that wailed out side the house three nighls running whei member of that family was marked for death
They prayed to God Imt over their shoulders their eyes were peeled and their ears attuned to another groups of spirits that recognized neither God nor man
CHAPTER FOUR Dancers la the Forest tTHE family was seated at the dinner table that night waiting for the head of the house to come home
Eileens eyes kept straying across the taide to study the face of her sister Nancy
Mrs Gannon looked tired and nervous and little ten year old Neil was chattering aboirt the topic that was the paramount subject of conversation in every home in Blairfield
little Neil piped his eyes round
The mines haunted and nobody dasnt go near it
The ghost will strike tlrem down dead
Eileens voice was not quite steady
Dont go around repeating such nonseiise
Cackling old women txy to ex plain everything by blaming it cm the spirits
You wait until Dad comes home and ask him
But they do say that all over town Mrs Gantion offered
Its not just the old women
Its the men too
The young men
Johnny OMarra was one who saw the apparition and hes not kd to be easily frightened Boyl Neil exploded
Johnny OMarra yanks out his gun and hang
The old ghost THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN Neil stop please Eileen cut him short
Her eyes probed Nancys face for the barest sign of reaction
She even engaged Nancys glance switched to look at Nancys right shoulder then back mean ingfully to her sisters face
But the play of glances seemed to mean nothing to Nancy
She just sat tlaere her small face in repose her large eyes that slanted up bit at the outer edges dark blue pools of innocence
Paddy Gannon came into the house with bang of the door and noisy clump of his big boots
He marched through the diningroom to wash at the kitchen sink
Through the splash of the water his voice carried through to the family in the next room
Mary you get ready and get Neil ready to take the eight oclock train for Reading in the morning
Youre going to stay with your sister for few days Whats that Paddy Mary Gannon asked in startled voice
Aw gee
Dad Neil protested
wanna stay here and see what happens about the ghost Oh you do Mr Gannon stamped in and took his place at the head of the table
Youre going to Reading with your mother young one
And Ill hear no more of your lip He turned to his wife ou get ready
This is no place for kids or women with weak hearts
Do you know what the whole towns talking about
Tlieyre saying the mine is haunted
Its the spirits who are to blame for the trou ble
Ill show them whos to blame
They wont go near the shaft and you know what that means
Starvation that will come so quick we wont have the strength to pull ourselves out of the way to die
Haunted it may be by all the evil spirits in hell but well work it just the same
And there will be bad days
So you and Neil go stay with your sister Why cant we all go Mrs Gannon asked plaintively
Theres nothing here now but bare living made by sneaking out coal in the dead of night
Trouble all the time
Secret societies and wearing white bands on your arms so you wont shoot down your neighbor
Its not ever coming back Paddy
Blairfield is Cackling like the old wives in the vil lage eh Gannon barked
Do as say
Eileen and Nancy can look after me and the house and Ill look after the mine haunted or not
Serve the food Mary THERE was tension harsh dis cordant note that seemed to vibrate in the air imlike the usual harmonious home life of the Gannons
Mrs Gannon looked scared and her hands trembled visibly
Even little Neil appeared to sense the change the sinister feeling of foreboding that hung in the room like fog
His strident young voice was dropped to hushed whisper
As Eileen studied the guikless smile on her younger sisters face cold chill raced down her spine and the small hair prickled on the back of her neck
It was Nancy not the talk of the haunted mine who had by some strange means deliber ately charged the air with an ominous portent and she was enjoying the result
Her smile said so
Nancy Eileen called sharply Dont look like that
Stop it Nancy looked at her sister and smiled even more sweetly
Eileen clenched her hands until the fin gers were numb and shut her mouth tight
She mustnt let this wild spirit of discord that suddenly permeated the house draw her into its whirlpool
Why did Nancy delight in making people afraid
Eileen excused herself and went into the kitchen
It seemed that Nancys smile had slightly derisive quality as she watched her sister leave the room
TERROR TALES That evenhig Paul Savage came to call
Mrs Gannon was upstairs with Neil get ting ready for their visit to Reading
Mr Ganncwi had gone out wearing the white brassard of tlie Silents on his arm
Nancy was sitting on the front steps watching full moon come up to paint the coun tryside with quidtlver
Paul and Eileen sat side by side in the living room
Paul covered the girls hand with his
Eileen wlqr do you keep putting me off
Is it bause of OMarra
My mind is filled with other things Paul
Terrible disturbing things
Some baleful influence seems to have settled over all of ns know Paul said
Tve heard the talk thats going on around town
That the mine is haunted and all that rot
But its dangerous talk more powerful than any sensible propaganda
We know there arent any ghosts in that shaft but as long as people think so youll get no sense out of them
Anything is apt to result from wild story like that
even went down the shaft myself looking for tlw ghost But nobody can prove it isnt haunt ed Eileen said
know shouldnt be lieve those fantastic stories but there are numbo of things dont want to be lieve
IVe been fighting them off reject ing them as impossible but they persist and Im terribly worried
cant even tell you Paul what tliey are It would be better if you did Paul coaxed gently
Eileen shook her head and ttiey sat for moment or two in silence holding hands
The girl started suddenly and dliill tre mor ran through her frame
Prom some where outside came weird half human cry wail that lingered like the echo of soul in torment
Eileens fingers locked around Pauls hand
What what was that Some dog baying at the full moon Paul smiled
No Eileen turned tense face toward Paul
heard it last night too
Just Hl that
Paul Ive got to tell somebody She jumped to her feet
Wheres Nancy She was outside sitting on the front steps admiring the full moon Paul said
guess shes still there Eileen ran for the front door and flung it open
The moon drenched the oountiy side with wan mysterious light
The front steps were carpeted in its glow but they were empty
Nancy was not out there
Eileen stood by the door and called several times
Paul came out and stood by her side
Suddenly she turned to him
Paul we must find her She seized his lapels with both hands
We must find Nancy But where did she go Paul asked
Where will we look
Eileen started down the steps digging Paul after her by the hand
Come quick ly
Weve got to find her
Paul where does old Seamus OCalahan live
You know the strange hermit TJp in the woods beyond the ridge some place Paul said
But you dont tliink Nancy would be there do you Oh dont know but lets try
If you only knew what Im afraid of
tTHEY stumbled through the woods climbing the slope to the ridge where old Seamus OCalahan was believed to live in cave
The bright moon made their path easy to find but Eileens haste made her feet unsteady
At the end of twenty minutes she paused to get her breadi and leaned weakly against Paul Savage
Its Nancy Paul dear
cant even tlxink of you until find out whats wrong with her Paul patted her shoulder understand ingly
Ill help all can darling THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN little farther on they came to clear ing the grass silvered like the surface of lake by the moonlight
Paul seized Eileens hand held her fast
Look Eileen stood there by Pauls side in the sliadow of the rim of trees and blinked her eyes unbelievingly at what slie saw in the clearing
Old Seamus OCalahan was standing straight as graven image in the center of the clearing the moon making his long white beard cascade of silver
Two figures danced around him in wide circle one following the mo tions and gyrations of the other
Both figures were snow white
One was beau tiful young girl nude as nymph of tiae forest
The other was great white goat
The goat was dancing on its hind legs pawing with its front ls as dancer keeps the rhythm with his hands and arms
Nancy Eileens voice was choked whisper
Yes Paul said slowly
Nancy Eileen started forward but he held her back
Wait he said
Thats marvelous barbaric beautiful Eileen tried to break away from him
Paul are you crazy too
Thats my sis ter Nancy dancing out there naked in the moonlight dancing with goat in front of crazy old man
Paul Ive got to stop her Wait Paul held her his eyes gripped by the strange sight
Graceful as birds on the wing smooth and supple as fish gliding in water the goat and the girl danced in smaller circle each time clos ing in around the still erect figure of the old man with the silver hair and beard
As they watched strange music seemed to come from nowhere lovely pulsing rhythm that was part of the dance and the moonlight barely audible Faint but clearly defined
Paul Eileen begged
Let me stop her
Dont let her do that mad pagan dance there without any clothes in the moonlight Reluctantly Paul walked by Eileens side as they left the fringe of trees and started across the clearing
Old Seamus OCalahan unfolded his arms and clapped his hands once
The faint music stopped
The great white goat dropped to all fours and trotted off int the woods
Nancy stood there unashamed in her natural state and watched them approach
Eileen stood before her sister probing her face
Nancy smiled
It was beauti ful she said
Wasnt it beautiful Where are your clothes Eileen de manded
Oh yes Nancy walked straight and poised as yoimg goddess to the edge of the wood where her clothes lay in heap
Paul Savage his eyes still filled with the wonder and beauty of it touched old Seamus OCalahzm on the arm
The mu sic where was it coming from The old whitebearded man spread his arms
It is always there all around us
It only grows louder when we need it Eileen holding her sister by the hand was calling Paul hurry
Lets go home please Paul joined the two sisters and they started off through the woods in the di rection of home
Eileen was sobbing au dibly
Nancy was walking proudly grace fully
Once at tight comer of the path Nancy turned her head and looked up at Paid
She smiled sweetly the moonlight showing every contour of her lovely young face
It was like childs no more selfconsdous than when he had seen her doing the naked pagan dance short time lack
Paul looked back over his shoulder
The clearing was still there like pool in the moonlight
But the old man with the silver hair and beard was gone
Gone too was the great white dancing goat
TBRROR TALES But dark figure appeared at the far edge of the clearhig
man was cutting across the edge of the clearing toward the deme woods
The moon was so bright Patd had no difficulty rognizing John OMarras burly figure with its charac teristic truculent stride
Now vdiere did that bird come from Paul asked himself
Was he hiding at the far side of ffie clearing all ffie time Nancy was dancing
He must have been
Why should he hide and sneak away after
think its about time told Eileen few things know about that lad
Hurry Paul please Eileen called from down the path
Im frightened
pAUL turned and hurried to catch up with the two sisters
They were al most home when noise on the path be hind them made Paul turn to look
Com ing toward them plainly visible in the light of the moon was an old woman
She moved quickly despite her hunched shoxdders and bent frame
grey shawl with bng fringe covered her head and the upper half of her body
As she ap proached made cackling noise and strudc the ground before her with her cane
As the path was narrow and the old woman evidently in hurry Paul stood aside to let her pass
The old woman passed him without glance and stamped up even with Nancy and Eileen
Ha Her shrill tackle awoke echoes in the wood
The changeHugf Her bony finger was extended toward Nancy almost toucliing the girls face with its hooked nail
Nancy stopped walking and looked at the crone with halfpitying expres sion
Eileen pushed the
old woman away
Go away you crazy old idiot
Dont ever call my sister that name
She is
She Is
The old woman beat the ground with her stick
was there at her birth
Your mother knows she is cfangeling
have smi her with Old Seamus OCalaban laughing at tragedy sitting on headstones in the graveyard saw her tonight when she danced with the goat in front of that old hewitch Seamus OCalahan
Shes no cliild born of woman
And faring bad luck and sudden death to them as lives with her and are dose to her
Pl Savage took some money from his pocket and pressed it into the old womans hand You didnt see thing
Take this and get good and drunk and have your self some more hallucinations
She closed her bony talons over the money held it close to her face to look then shuffled off bobbing her head
Paul turned to the two girls
Lets wait lit tle while and let her get start Half crazy lialf drunk
You mustnt feel hurt at what she said Nancy
was just thinking Nancy said soft ly
How odd and tlirilling it would be to find out one was diangeling
Not the cliild of mortal woman but an ageless spirit that comes back to the earth every century or so
Stop it Nancy
Eileens voice was hoarse
Dont talk like that
Youre be ing silly
Youre the natural daughter of your mother and mine
Youre my very own sister and wont have any crazy old hag calling you things like that
From far up the path as if she had heard came the old crones voice crying out in brittle caclde Changeling Changdingt CHAPTER nVE Cdl of the Bandiee HE residents of Blairfield were frightened
Something had happened to call curse down upon them that was unanimously agreed
THie mine tlmt pirt food in their mouths and clothes on their THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN backs was haunted bewitched
The curse was reaching out to envelop them all
Soon the pinch of want would be added to the vague apprehension of the curse of the mine
No more trucks rolled at night
Paddy Gannon talked himself hoarse at meeting of the Silents but not one man among them would join him to enter the shaft
Not even Johnny OMarra
For Johnny had seen the specter with his own eyes
The women folk backed their men
Dont go near that shaft Tis cursed and be sure of that And an old crone leaning on crooked stick and holding her fringed shawl around her bent shoulders with taloned bands shuffled up and down the street stopped at stores and houses
Everywhere she cackled the same awesome story
There was changeling in their midst
thing in human form not child of woman but creature of the spirit world walked among them daily
Posing as Paddy Gannons own daughter it was
But no natural daughter at all at all
Paddy Gannon heard the gossip and took his pretty daughter by the hand
He brought Nancy around to Father Doyles house and held his broad thumb on the priests bell imtil an aged housekeeper opened the door
Is His Reverence in Gannon de manded
Id like to see him if he is Yes The old housekeeper was hesi tant
dont know Hell see me Im sure Gannon pushed in still holding Nancy by the hand
He walked into the hall and gentle voice called from the front room
In here Paddy Gannon The shades were drawn and the room was in dark ness
Gannon halted on the threshold
Are you in the dark Father Im afraid am Paddy Gannon Father Doyle said gently
few hours ago lost the sight of my eyes
Dr Akers was here and will be back
There seems to be no reason for it
But am blind
Enough of that then
Can do something for you Blind Paddy Gannons booming voice dropped to whisper
God pre serve your eyes Father
But Ive brought my daughter Nancy
Theres cruel ru mor going around
The people are say ing my daughter here is changeling
What can we do to stop this terrible talk Come here my child Father Doyle said
Can you see me in the dark
Give me your hand
You arent going to let this cruel talk make you bitter or envious are you
Because we know there is no such thing
There is only one Spirit and that benevolent KDne Only man is cruel and wicked Oh dont mind
Father Nancy said sweetly
think it would be thrilling to be spirit not bound by the shackles of this earth All youth feels tlmt way my child the priest said
Now go outside please
want word with your father After moment the priest asked Has she left the room Paddy Gannon Yes Father She moves so lightly one might well believe her to be spirit Father Doyle said with smile in his voice
Send her away Paddy Gannon to good convent some place in the country where live and growing things aboimd
The good Sisters will know what to do to shape that nim ble mind without breaking her spirit
But send her away because these good people of Blairfield can be very cruel THE word went aroimd that Paddy Gannon had taken his daughter Nancy to see the priest to have Father Doyle drive out the devil that possessed her
But before he got there Father Doyle had gone blind
TERROR TALES The Devil had closed the eyes of God Even on the street now people talked in awed whispers
Nancy Gannon walked down the main street and people stopped as if turned to stone at her approach
Mothers pulled their little children out of the way as if the devil htmsdf was abroad
Even the ds seemed to sense the fearful isolation and slunk out of her way
In the old days they told each other she would have been driven out of town as witch
Maybe even burned
AU of it had no effect on Nancy
She walked as if in world of her own and her very manner of goit whipped tlie people mto frenzy of hate
She was no real daughter of Paddy and Mary Gan non
She was child of the devil and the curse that held Blairfield in its grasp was her doing
Nancy went her way smiling sweetly faraway look on her lovely elfin face
Eileen Gannon was tearful and more than little frightened as she talked to Paul Savage
What can do Paul
The whole town is calling Nancy spawn of some evil spirit Vicious stupid peasants
Paul growled
But Paul Eileen stammered
She does such ttrate things you can hardly Uame them
She sneaks out at night and meets Seamus OCalahan
She was there when the cavein killed Eddie Dwyer
The night the ghost was seen in the shaft and Joe Dixon fell to his death she was gone all night and in the morniag her feet were bruised and black and she had strange wound in her shoulder
Maybe this crazy old man has something to do with these awful events
Maybp he is in fluencing Nancy to do things that are connected in some way with these trage dies
Seamus OCalahan is bit cradeed Paul told her
But hes not the one to bring the tremble that holds this commu nity in its grip right now
Ive theory of my own
And dont worry about Nancy
Shes rare and lovely creature
Sucli grace and beauty to be bom and reared in Blairfield Stop it
Eileen screamed
Ever since you saw her dancing naked in the moon light youve done nothing but stare at her and follow her with your eyes
Isnt it bad enough that my own sister is be witched but you have to fall under her spell Eileen youre hysterical
Ill show you Please go Eileen begged
cant stand any more
Dont come back ever
You you too are coming under the spell
can see it feel it
Go for keeps and forever
First she bewitched John OMarra now its you
You need little rest Paul said
Ill see you tomorrow
No Eileen slammed the door beloind him and leaned weng against the wall
Never come back
There wont be any tomorrow Paddy Gannon was talking to group of grimfaced naen at meeting of the SUents
He was using strong words in strong voice
Were they going to sit down and wait for starvation
Were they go ing to let their wives and kids starve with good coal ready for the pick be cause some old crones had said there was curse on the mine
Im going in there tonight
he shout ed
And Im going to get coal
And if theres man amotg you with the guts of louse hell go with me and the rest of you can stay home and tell your beads and starve like rats When he climbed the hill little later fifteen men were Ijehind him
Others were getting the trucks still others carried rifles and sidearms to stand guard while the shift worked
THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN lILEEN GANNON stood in her room with her back to the door and watched her sister Nancy get rdy for bed
When the younger girl had retired Eileen turned the key in the door and began to undress
Youre going to sleep beside me arent you Eiken
Nancy asked
Yes of course Eileen tried to keep her voice steady
Why not Because everyone else is afraid of me
Everyone in the world
Mother took Neil away and father wont stay in the house
The people in town draw away from me but you arent the least bit frightened are you Of comse not Eileen was trembling
She got into bed and reached out to ex tinguish the bed light but halted her hand
It is strange to see fear on peoples faces Nancy said
It gives one an ex ultant thriH
What would make you twist your face in fear Eileen The younger sister moved close and looked into Eileens eyes
Eileen steded herself against showing any emotion
She tried to smile at her sister
Suddenly there came the weird halfhuman cry she had heard on tlie two previous nights
It seemed to oome from the ard outside the house
Its gliastly timbre swmed to run up and down her spine like needles as it climbed the regis ter to wail of torment
She sat bolt upright in bed
Whats that
Nancy laughed gleefully Your eyes showed fear stark uncontrollable fear
Your naked terrified soul was in your eyes the way person looks when death stares them in the face
It is marvelous thrilling
She edged close to Eileen
Soon shall see that look in your eyes again
know it soon But tliat oise Eileen muttered
That dreadful sound Thats Ihe banshee Nancy shrilled
Three nights it has wailed
And that means death She bounded oat of bed and stood on her bare toes as if poised for flight
Her head was thrown hack her eyes alight with rapture
The bMishee Eileen covered her face with her hands then by sheer force of will pulled them away and looked at the weird tableau of her sister standing with outstretched arms head thrown back
For split second it looked to Eileen as if huge white bat wings spread stood there instead of Nancy
Resolutely she got out of bed and approached Nancy
Go back to bed Nancy
Youre hys terical But sfie couldnt keep her voice levd and the nerves in her body tingled so that she walked jerkily
Nancy lowered her Iiead and stared at her sister then as Eileen drew close Nancys arms came out toward her went around Eileens shoulders
Tense and shaken Eileen went little limp
As she sagged she felt Nancys fingers slide up and close around her throat
Through haze she heard Nancys voice
have heard the banshee call
must go
When Eileen recovered from her faint Nancy was gone
CHAPTER SIX Death ia Nymph pAUL SAVAGE responded at once to EileMis frantic teIqhone call
As he drew up to the front of the house in his small car Eileen was standing on the porch
She ran down the steps and seized Pauls arm in her two hands
Nancy has gone again
We must find her Do you know where she went No
But lets try the mine
Paul she acted like mad persott
We must find her and bring her back All right Paul started the car
But its dangerous to be sneaking around the TERROR TALES mine at this hour of the night
The men are working up there and theyll shoot on sight know it Eileen said in hushed tones
She only had her nightgown on
If she goes up there they might think it has something to do with the ghost that is supposed to be haunting it
They might kill her in the darkness before they see who it is
Hurry please
You know how excited they all are Right Paul Savage guided his car out of the village and up the hill to the dark shaft of the Blairfield mine
He took short cut over bumpy road as they neared the top of the rise
As they bounced around curve his headlights picked out something that flashed white in the darkness
He stood on his brakes
What was that It was Nancy Eileen gasped
Im sure it was
Over there by that wooden shack Paul Savage took flashlight from the pocket of the car and got out
Come on he told Eileen
That shack is an air vent to number one tunnel
Well soon see if that was Nancy The two left the car and ran across the field to the little wooden shack
It was unlocked and Paul directed the beam of his flashlight inside as he swung the door open
The grating that covered the hole inside was leaning against the wood en side of the little shanty
Dont tell me Paul said slowly
She couldnt have gone down that vent She must have Eileen insisted
saw her come in here Paid knelt and played his light down the vent hole about four feet in diam eter roughly shored with heavy planking
There are footholds in this thing he said
But still cant imagine She went down there Eileen insist ed
Shes gone down there where the men are working
Theyll see her white nightgown in the dark and shoot her
Paul weve got to go down and find her Im another one they dont want around here Paul said ruefully
Theyd think was spying for the company and give me the business but here goes
Ill go down first and give you light He switched tlie light off and let him self down the vent feeling with hands and feet for the iron footholds that had been driven into the shoring
The vent sloped off around hard rock and was nar rower at that point
Then it widened again
Eventually his feet struck hard surface
He flashed his light again and saw that he was nr the end of tunnel
Above him he could hear Eileens prog ress down the vent shaft
He played the light for her and the two of them stood in the tunnel black as the coal it sired except for Pauls flashlight
She must have gone this way Paul said
Come on HERE was narrow gauge track along the floor of the tunnel and the footing was imcertain so Paul kept the light on the ground before them
They approached bay and Paul stopped sud denly
Did you hear flut noise Yes
What was Eileens voice was hushed whisper
The men are working number three vein the next below on this shaft Paul told her
Its about one hundred and fifty feet down
The vein below that is flooded because the pump hasnt been kept going
They must have stopped working because the lift bucket isnt moving But that noise Eileen repeated
It seemed to come from right ahead in the tunnel know Paul said
And nobody is working up on this level
Maybe its Nancy
Come on He led her out to the bay and around the shaft
There was no indication that score of men were THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN working right below them
The vein ran off at tangent on the other side of the bay
Eileen stuck close to Paul and walked with one hand extended touching his back
It smells very unpleasantly she said
Almost gagging They are working without the exhaust blowers to dean out the foul air Paul told her
Clean air comes down the shaft but even at best its hard to exhaust the had air
These men are taking chances but its diat or starve thats why my sym pathies He stopped talking and his frame stiffened
Standing bdiind him with her hand touching his back Eileen knew from his abrupt tenseness that they had suddenly come upon something in that dark underground tunnel
He stood there with the light directed straight in front of him
Eileen moved so she could see around him
He tried to stop her by an upfiung arm but she had already seen
Propped tip against the wall of the vein in half sitting posture was big Paddy Gannon Eileens father
He was still as the blackhewn wall behind him and his eyes were wide open and staring star ing up at them
Paul held the light on the man sitting there so limp and stiD like collapsed figure in wax museum
Dad Eileen was on her knees before him
Whats happened
Whats wrong Hold the light Paul gave the girl the flashlight and moved her gently to one side
He knelt beside the slumped form of big Paddy Gannon and felt for pulse
Then he placed liis ear against Gannons chest and listened for heart beat
But he knew from the touch of him that Pidy Gannon was dead
His flesh was already cold clay although rigor mortis had not yet set in
He put bis hand behind Gannws shoulders in an ef fort to straighten the grotesque figure
His hand felt something wet and sticky
As he pulled it away and looked at it in the flashlights beam he saw it was cov ered with blood
Eileen saw it too
She let out pitiful litde cry and dropped the light
Paul turned quickly and reached for her in the dark to catch her as she fell
She went limp in his arms
Gently he low ered her to the ground and began to fum ble around for the flashlight but it dudcd his groping fingers
Paul straightened up and his fingers were unsteady as he probed his pockets for matches
There was no warning sound but suddenly light seemed to flash at the back of his head
The dark ness spun before liim in dizzy cone
He could feel hhnsdf falling losing con sciousness
It was as If the roof of the vein had fallen in on him
As he slipped into oblivion his last thought was So this is what cavein is like
tlLEEN regained her senses slowly
Size was coughing and gagging and the darkness was around her like tiiick black blanket
She began to strule to her feet as she remembered the events just before she had fainted
She was in the coal vein with Paul looking for Nancy and they had found her father dead
And there had been blood on Pauls hand as he pulled it away from her fa thers body
She snapped alert
Utter and complete silence esaept for the regular drip of water somewhere
Paul She callal quietly at first
Then as the only response was the chokedoff echo of her own frightened voice she called again louder
Still no response and she screamed his name again and again only to have it beat back at her like the mocking taunt of hundred fiends hidden in the blackness
Her head turned first one way then another try ing to make out some object
In one di rection she thought she caught the flicker of light
TERROR TALES She stumbled over the rough floor of the tunnel toward the gleam of lht
The narrowgauge track tore one shoe off but she stumbled on unheeding
The tunnel made turn and her hands fumbled along the rocky wall following it
Then she came upon the light
And she stood frozen with horror her senses refusing to accept the scene
Standing in the middle of the tunnel was her sister Nancy still clad only in her white nightgown
Nancy was holding coal oil torch in her left hand holding it aloft so its yellowish flame licked at the roof of the vein
And in her right hand Nancy gripped long knife and its bright blade was smeared red with blood Nancy Nancy came toward her sister slowly holding the torch out before her
In its dancing light Eileen could see Nancys face plainly
It had strange expression one of almost childish delight
And her voice when she spoke was like the pleased gurgle of little girl
Ah you are afraid
can see it now
Your face is all knotted and your eyes they stare so
They stare like my fathers eyes stared when he knew he was dying
All life is dull until the moment of death
Then comes the thrill the only real thrill in the world
The thrill of meeting death Eileen tried to speak but her tongue was numb
She tried to pray but her mind was in the throes of terrible agony that blotted out all reason
Nancy is mad Voices shrieking inside her said
She is not your sister
She is fiend in carnate
She killed your father with that awful gleaming redsmeared knife
She can kill because she has no soul
She is fiend and now she is going to kill you
She is going to plunge that knife still smeared with your fathers blood into you
Just so she can see your eyes when you die Her knees gave way and she knelt help lessly before the slim young girl who smiled like child but held murderous knife upraised
Dont pray Eileen Nancy said soft ly
It will do no good
do not like prayers
They are the meanings of weak mortals
Maybe when you die you will become spirit as am spirit
You will be happier Nancs face took on the reddish glow of the torch and the crimson smear on the bright knife seemed reflected in her eyes
She moved closer
Eileen tried to shut her eyes but strange fascination held them wide and staring
Before their ter rified stare Nancys figure appeared to float toward her like wraith mur derous specter redstained with human gore
CHAPTER SEVEN Hell Underground pAUL SAVAGE struggled back to con sciousness with the strange feeling that somebody was calling his name far off
His head vibrated with pain and when he touched the back of it with his fingers he felt large swelling cut across the top
He remembered thinking he had been struck by cavein but he was not hemmed in by rock or soil
He felt about him in the pitch blackness then called Eileens name
There was no answer
His head spun and breathing was difficult
Standing erect Paul braced himself and took deep breath
Smoke The unmistakable pungent smell of smoke permeated the foul air of the vein tunnel
In the blackness it was even more terrifying
It rolled about him until he thought he could see it in the dark he could taste its oily yellow stench and feel his aching eyes smart with it
Eileen was somewhere in that tunnel
THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN She had been lying there in faint when the blow he believed to be cavein had felled him
Scrambling liolding small paper matches in his fingers he found the fiashliglrt
Eileen was gone
Tlie crumpled form of Paddy Gannon was there eyes still wide and staring but the girl was gone
The flashlight showed drifting slow coiling clouds of smoke
Somewhere in the iil fated shaft there was fire
Calling the girls name Paul hurried toward the far end of the vein tumiel
Ahead was curve and beyond it voices
He rounded the curve and came upon scene like picture of an ancient human sacrifice
Eileen knelt head bowed on the floor of tlie tunnel
Before her holding the torch and die uplifted knife was Nancy
The expression on Nancys face was sheer rapture
She was staring at Eileens face with gleeful concentration
She did not look up at Pauls arrival
He started to shout tlien checked himself
Nancy in this mood was dangerous
The knife in her hand was red with blood
Put down the knife Nancy he said quietly
We must go
The shaft is on fire
It is burning and we must go Nan took backward step
Beautiful red flames lighting the fright ened faces of men inen trapped by fire
Fire is more beautiful than the knife Paul stalled inching close
Give me the knife Nancy
We will go and watch the fire The yellow smoke was getting dense in the close tunnel seeping in clos ing around them like fog
Nancy started to hand Paul the knife
voice behind him snarled Give it to him point first
Plunge it in his throat Nancy
Watch his eyes as he dies Paul whirled to see John OMarra standing in the tunnel right be hind hinC flashlight in his left liand and club in his right
By the light of Nancys torch Paul could see the murderous light in Johns dark eyes
Paul swung his arm quicldy and threw his own flashlht
John OMarra was too close to duck but hie right hand swung the dub just as the flashlight struck him between the eyes
Paul dived and lodced both hands around John OMarfa right wrist TILEEN was trying weakly to get to her feet The smoke was Winding and gagging her
The torch Nancy held was losing its glare in pall of creeping smoke
Paul hunched his shoulders and held OMarra with botli arms while Jolin hammered his face and head witfi his free hand
Pauls head came down and he dosed his jaws on OMarras right wrist
He bit down until he felt OMarrag flesh give felt the bone in his teeth John OMarra gave scream of agony and tried to free his arm
He let go of the club and thrashed around like wounded tiger
Paul could taste warm blood in his mouth
Suddenly he unclenched his jaws and smashed with both hands at the face writhing before him in the smoke
As John OMarra went down Paul drove his heel in his face kicked him savagely ruthlessly until the man went limp on the ground
The girfs answer was choked sob
The fire is in the shaft
We must go through it to reach the vent we came in by
Give me your hand
Nancy suddenly came to life at the word fire
She darted past them holding the torch aloft
She disappeared down the tunnel and around the curve
Paul tied his handkerchief around Eileens nose and mouth and began to lead her back along the tunnel
Near the bay where the main shaft went down the smoke was thickest
The fire was dovm below where the men were TERROR TALES working but the lift bucket seemed out of order
Its cable was silent
Only black ness and the oily smoke showed in the beam of Pauls light
down draft at the main shaft forced the smoke out in smothering billows and drove it along the vein
Paul held his breath gripped Eileens hand and pulled her after him
Pauls eyes were almost blinded and his lungs were bursting when the open ing of the vent showed in his flashlights beam
He pushed Eileen up the crude ascent
She was so weak he had to sup port her weight on his shoulders at each step
The air became clearer
He could breathe
Climbing fighting for breath they made the surface toppled out of the little wooden shack and fell forward on the ground side by side
CHAPTER EIGHT Burn the Witchl IKE flash of lightning word hit Blairfield
Lights went on in houses as the awful news was shouted from one to the other
Trouble at the mine The curse had struck again at the little band of men who had defied it to scratch little coal from the bowels of the earth
On foot and in tinny old cars the frantic parade wound up the hill to the mine
Torches flared and the crowd gathered
They could not go too close for foul black smoke rolled in great billows from the mouth of the shaft
Some of the men who had been working on the shift gasped out the story
With out warning the first stench of smoke had smitten them
Without the usual precau tions it was every man for himself with no facilities for fighting the fire or even determining the source
The men on the second level were suffocated before they could claw their way to freedom
Some got up in the bucket but the vengeful yellow and black smoke drove back all who tried to reach the others
Ten men trapped in that veritable hell while their friends and families wailed and prayed and screamed outside the mouth of the shaft
Somebody raised an agonized cry Look Nancy Gannon and old Seamus OCal ahan stood on the rise to one side of the shaft
Their forms and faces were plainly visible in the dancing torchlight
The old mans face was devoid of expression but the girls was registering sheer ecstasy
The changeling Her standing there bubbling with joy while her own father is in that pit of hell Hes not her own father
Shes no child of the world
Shes the devils spawn and the cause of our grief Shes witch The griefmaddened mob poured its emotion toward this fresh target
The men and women began to call insults and threats
Nancy turned toward them and smiled
Somebody called
If wed driven her out of town wed have been spared this curse Drive her out now Burn her
Burn the witch Old Seamus OCalahan stood between the girl and the onrushing mob his arms outspread
Dont harm the child
Shes done no wrong The old man was trampled underfoot and great red stains showed on his silver beard in the jumping light of the torches as they swept him down to the ground
The girl backed away slowly at first then she turned and began to run throwir over her shoulder look like young doe in the forest being harried by pack of dogs
The part of the crowd that held back at first leaped in their emotions whipped THE Gffil WHO LOVED PAIN fey the chase
They spread out their torches ttraking crazy jumpiag flaxes ai they raa
They ced bloodctjrdltng threats and goaded themselves by shriel ing words of abuse
The blood lust of the bust was upon them
The pentup fear and anger of days was finding its vent
They closed in behind the rtmning fir snarling like mad dogs
pAUL SAVAGE and Eileen Gannon lay about two hundred yards from the mouth of the main shaft
For some minutes their labored and tortured breath ing was the only sound either uttered
Then Paid ssid You all right Eileen Yes she answered
Im feeling little sick and my eyes burn
Paul can understand it all Ive been working on all this trouble at the mine Paul told her in gasping breaths
Old Seamus OCalahan had nothing to do with any more than Nancy did
can explain it all to you if want to listen
Yes yes
But not now
Wliat are they doing around the mouth of the shaft
Why are they all running like that It must be the fire Paul said
There must be men trapped down there Nancy was running with mouth open now her eyes staring wildly
The mob snarling at her heels shrieked insane ex ultation as her gait faltered
Her fleet young legs were trembling near exhaus tion
Ahead was small clump of woods
She ran stumHing toward it
The pur soing mob fatmed and scrambled after her
She was traijod
The litrie knoll ended in an rupt precipice with sheer drop of more than hundred feet
She would have to stop at its edge
Then they would get trer
The torches moved down more slowly as the pursuers closed in
They advanced oa the little fiogers of laud raised above the surpoanding terrain the trap the huxud doe was too frightened to see
They moved in relentlessly right to the edge of the cliff
rabbit small pure white rabbit lookl at them with wide bewildered eyes
But there was no sign of the girl
It was as if she had disap peared from the face of the earth Eileen and Paul Savage searched the faces of the crowd looking for Nancy
People paid no attention to them
No explanation of the chase was given
They did not ask
They just kept locdciag half fearfully through the crowd
Then some body told Eileen that her father was one of those who had been trapped in the mine probably smothered
At the mention of her fathers name the horrible scene in the mine tunnel rushed back to flood tlie girls senses
She slipped to the ground in dead faint
When slie opened her eyes Paul had carried her back little way from the crowd around the smoking shaft
Ive been woridng on this thing for weeks he told her
It wont make you feel any better now that your father is gone but the curse that had all these peo ple frantic was deliberate frameup
Johnny OMarra had made deal with mob who wanted to take take over this mine and bootleg coal
But they knew theyd never take it from the Blairfield crowd by force
He framed this stuff those accidents
He used poor strange Nancy even started this fire
But the fire got out of band
dont think he meant it to
guess hell never come out now was afraid it was really bewitched Eileen said
And vas afraid that Nancy and old Seamus OCalahan had something to do with it He had nothing to do with it Paul told her And OMarra just used Nancy Paul do you think she killed Dad Eileen whispered
Im sure OMarra did it
Your TERROR TALES father must have discovered John was re sponsible for the dirty work
Nancy must have come upon them just as he killed your father
OMarra knew Nancy was strange so he gave her the knife to frighten us away But she looked so horrible Eileen in sisted
She was going to kill me dont think so Paul said
She just wanted to see fear in your eyes
Lets go home
Nancy is probably there by now calm as anyone TUT Nancy was not home when they got there
She was never seen again
The last anyone had seen of her was when she had fled frightened before the mob into that little patch of woods
Three days later Eileen was getting ready to leave Blairfield for good
She was coming out of store in the village when an old woman stopped her
The same old crone who had called Nancy changeling
The hag bobbed her head and cackled
Did you hear about Mrs Dow ney Eileen shrank back then asked civilly What about Mrs Downey little white rabbit came out of the woods and hopped right into her kitchen It must have been good luck because Mrs Downey childless these sixteen years just had baby girl
And she not knowing or expecting one
was there when it was bom
pretty little girl with big blue eyes that slant up at the outside corners Thats very nice Im sure Eileen hurried on to where Paul was waiting in his car
Whats the matter Paul asked
You look as if youd just seen ghost Im afraid if stay here will she said
Paul drive as fast as you can and as far as you can
There are some things Ill never be able to understand and dont think want to and never never talk to me about anything that hap pened here just as long as live Still brooding about Nancy She gave him long searching look
Ive stopped brooding about Nancy
Its hard to explain but Nancy is off my conscience now
dont feel that Pm responsible for her any more Paul breathed sigh of relief
Thank goodness thats cleared up Eileen shook her head
It isnt and it never will be
But there are some things dont want to understand and thats one of them Paul nodded
Amen THE END HER SUITOR FROM HELL Bij Appel Author of Attic of Terror etc
Sequestered in their swampland home Ralph Payne and his beautiful young wife desired strong comely children
But that was before their splendid bodies began to turn into horrid travesties of human form which could never produce such off spring
ometimes at night when high moon glints on the surface of that dark pool where first encountered the shrinking death doubt and terror cleave my brain with their daggerstrokes and despair of ever regaining my normal imROR TALES physique and health
Sometimes in my sleep seem to feel again the hideous torpidity of mind the loathsome human fluidity of bone and muscle that rendered me an inert jellyfish shrunken to the proportions of child
But science yet may save me
We were celebrating my thirtieth birth day here at the old Louisiana plantation where our family the Paynes have lived for century past
On every hand the grounds are guarded by barrier of for bidding swamps through which hard road leads to various plots of high land now cultivated by adsite tenants oece tilled by my grandfatliws bkek slaves
During the year since Grace and were married the old manor house had been modernzed in varions ways and foremost among improvements was gleaming whitetiled outdoor swimming pool de signed to take the curse off torrid summer days
When the scorching sus had drojqjed behind surrounding wail of nmssdraped ejpress trees Grace proposed coding dip
Akhoi our guest
Doctor Hemerich Koop made some small objection socm we coaxed him into bathing suit and led him to the brink of the inviting basin
Grace ran to the end of the springboard her delitely molded form poised as lightly as mocking birds upon swaying bough
Arcing through the air clean dive that setrt drops sparkling upward she rose to the surface laughing and called Come in Its delightful Then her face sobered as she floated there regarding the two of us with thoughtfrri eyes
SENSED the comparison she was msdfing vid knew the reason
Doctor Koc whom bad endoyed ostetsibly to manage small ivate hospital tqon tfte jrfantation for the benefit of tenant families but actually to safeguard the health of my bride was one of her school day lovers whose doglike devotion had en dured through adolescent years
As one of an adoring dozen she had given liis aspirations no serious thought until with college behind Iiim and profitable pro fession ahead he proposed marriage and she told him it could not be
With disarming candor she had con fessed that wanted husband whose physique would match her own bodily health and streitii because she desired numerous cWldren and there must be no heredity taints that might prevent tise growth of tall sons and love daughters
Koops years numbered the same as mine but stood six feet two in my stoddngs and tipped the scales at two hundred weight
He was scrawny man of five feet four and childhood injury had left his back sKtiy huitthed
Be neath his bulging brow dwelt brain whose keenness mine probably never would attain although did weQ enough at managing tlie estate
Hemerich Koop also guessed the tenor of lier thoughts
Srailir he said heartily What gorgeems pair of animals you are
In with you Ralph and have your fun
Ill sit and watch With die sense of something akki to pity plunged sympathizing with the hopelessness of his pliit yet selfishly glad in the knowledge that liis foodoeas for Grse would result in especially watch ful care
That meant great deal to young couple expecting to raise family in tlie depths of swamp forty miles from tlie nearest dty
It meMit more than that to me five minutes latw when monstrous face was thrust out of dump of shrubbery few yards away and the idiot Pedro begaa smarling obscene Spanish oaths which frightened Grace into fit of trembling hysteria
HER SUITOR FROM HELL Following final gst of vile curses Pedro hurled some curiously shaped ob ject which splashed into the pool near where Grace dung to me
Then he scut tled into the swamp before could call servant to catch him
held my wife in my arms sitting upon bench beneath the pergola while Koop ran to the house for his small black bag
Returning he gave her sedative
Be tween us we strove to calm her fears in sisting that the halfwits outburst was meaningless but still terrified she cried He has grown more boldl It has dreadful meaning
That old crone Zell Mendez is slowly goading him to the point of murder
They mean to kill you Ralph because of the accident that crippled him laughed the idea aside but even Hem erich Koops darkbrowed face betrayed deep concern
Uneasily he said All the tenants talk of the threats Zell Mendez makes against you
They fear her curses
Superstitiously they believe that she is in league with the devil
Some times wonder
Sorcerers have per formed strange deeds which science can not fathom For Gods sake Koop exclaimed
You dont mean that you believe in such twaddle He smiled grimly
Not as witchcraft
If thats what youre thinking
But we live in swamp Ralph and must con fess that some of the secrets of swamp herbs and poisons handed down from one generation of voodoo practitioners to another have not yet been solved by the medical profession
Did you read last spring of the man in Bay St Louis whose stature is slowly shrinking
Who has been dwarfed to the size of child from height of six feet
Not only is he said to be suffering from curse but similar cases have been recorded in Barbados and in Porto Rico
It makes one wonder Angrily seized the bottle of brandy he had brought from the house and gulped steadying drink
Grace said tearfully Why should she blame you that old old witch for an accident that was un avoidable
Three people swore that Pedro Mendez darted out of the brush squarely in front of your car Forget it dear said inwardly shud dering at the recollection of stunning impact the sickening crunch of flesh un der heavy wheels the screams of the stricken idiot when my speeding roadster felled him
Doctor Koop did everything pyossible for the poor fellow
And neither Pedros curses nor his mothers will mend his crooked legs nor harm us Hemerich Koop was looking toward the glassy surface of the pool
What did he throw at you when he was swearing there
saw something queer splash Ill see Standing on the brink scrutinized the white bottom saw small blue bottle lying in the deep end exuding an inky cloud
There it is
Ill fetch it up dived
The immersion cooled my ex cited blood instantly
But even as en joyed the pleasant sensation blighting fir struck home
Cooled met felt chilled to the bone
My limbs seemed frozen
Neither arms nor legs would func tion
In state of complete paralysis glided to the bottom
The air in my lungs slowly raised me to the top but hung face downward helpless
By no force of will could command the movement of single muscle
When my tortured lungs rebelled and could no longer forestall the gasp which filled them with water in drowning flood heard Graces shrill cry of alarm echo as from great distance
Then Uack coma enfolded me
TERROR TALES THE time which foibwed was marked hy vagufr peria of light and dark ness
OccasiotKdfy realised that lay in hospital bed tiiat doctcH and nurse came and wet that had sot drowned but was alive
and nights passed like blur cd delirium studded with moments of ex cruciating agony broken by terrifying dreaiaM ta which tiie idiots face peared tft leer at me as suffered there while he gibbered of escape from pain through ue of some drug contained in small beetle ef hellish midnht blue
At last after an eternity nameless terror there came se ef clear consciousness yet so weak had my strange illness left me that could not raise my heavy eyelids and perforce without sign of life lay listening to the voices of Doctor Koop and Grace
He is wasting away to death My vrifes anguished tone was sharp with grief
It is Zell Mendezs curse RaljA is doomed
You cannot save him Now now my dear the doctor chided
Dont give up hope so easily
He lives
And while theres life theres hope aplenty
If only could tell His voke thinned on troubled note
Whedier this queer shrinkage is die re stdt of drug or something worse Youve said that before There was near frenzy in Graces cry You too be lieve it is curse That oH Zell Mendez has bewitched him Nonsense Koop snapped sharply
Of course it must be the work of drug
But unfortunately the small blue bottle which Pedro tlffew into the swimmmg pool had quite emptied itself brfoie went back to recorer it Anais of water rn the tank produced no satisfactnry Tceidts because of great tilution
We have not yet divered the nature of the poison If Zell Mendez codd be forced to teSr Despair edged my wifes sweet voice
Ive plded with her but riie only laughs showing her yellow hags teetli in gloating snarl calling down still more terrible oirses upon poor Ralphs head
Oh will he ever be conscious again
Or trill he die Try as might could not opm my ey nor give any sign that life was bura more brightly within me that all was not lost Grace came to the bedside
felt the warm towh of her fingers opon my cold and fiiuxtd hand In Iter stifled sob Acre was note of sheer horror tlie reason for which did not then compre hend
Somehow you rau stop this horrible thing Heuierich she exclaimed
At any cost
Call in specialists to aid you use every resource that money can buy before it is too late My dear Grace Hemerich Koop said money wont help nor can any specialist am doing my best to infitiicfr the out come of this peculiar sekure and no one could do more His words cheered me as lay there motionless helpless hulk for knew the keenness of his brain his thoroughness in seeking the solution of difficulties
If only he could contrive to ease the worries widi which Grace was besieged
They left the room together
heard door open and close
Then for hours it seemed was plagued ly visions of vicious faces leering
The tmwholesotne countenance of old Zell Meadez loomed above the foot of my bed sixgetoothed
wildeyed stringy grey hair straggling across her leathv cheeka
tkout the ltett Bps mouthed venomous curses over and over and never in life or death would she fve the accident that had cripfded her son
Pedros magltgnant visage tormeftted me after his mothers dnsmed and faded
moron at best he was and HER SUITOR FROM HELL pimply
His forehead sloped straight away in line with long pointed nose and his chin receded obliquely to form snouted face like hogs
After my car had smashed his legs and left them but flopping clubs upon which he stumped about with the aid of two canes Pedros appearance was enough to frighten women and children
His witless tongue forever drolled profane obscenity
Lying there in my torpid state seeming to hear the foul threats he voiced sud denly was obsessed with fear for Grace
What if the idiot sought to vent his spleen upon her
Alone in our big house save for black servants she would prove easy prey for him
The thought shocked me into wakefulness
My eyes snapped open they widened with consternation and my jaw hung loose at sight of the ugly face peering through an open window near my bed
tipEDROl gasped
Is it you
Did hear you talking meant every word of it he whis pered shrilly
And why not
Now youre no better than me
Filthy beast rasped weakly
If hear that youve so much as looked at Grace Ill horsewhip you
And should you attempt to molest her Ill break your back with my two hands Yaah
Your hands
Look at em and tell me how much breakin they can ever do
Youll never get off that bed alive
Dont you know that your finish is all planned Pedro loosened the screen and swung it aside
thought he intended to clamber in and murder me but streak of stub bornness kept me from calling aloud for help
With all the force of my will strove to lift the hands he mentioned so contemptuously but could not
Power less as babe demanded hoarsely What do you want
What do you mean to do Pedro grinned his eyes shining redly like two mirrors of hate
His subdued laughter jangled
Ill do everything said after youre dead
She wont listen till youre gone
But now that you look worse than me your pretty wifell let me love her once youre out of the way red haze of hate suffused my brain and for space could not see clearly
Then the spasm passed and found him leaning through the aperture balancing tiny blue bottle upon his palm
Take it Pedro invited
Quick death easy death without any pain
Ma wanted me to slip it into your grub to make sure you die
But taint worth the risk
Youre dyin now
Take it yourself so your wifell quit cryin about you and listen to me Get out raged
Go away from that window before yell for help
Ill have you shot Pedro drew back hurriedly
That aint no way to act he com plained after came to do you favor
Ill leave the bottle in this comer
Nobodyll see it and youll want it soon He re fastened the screen
After long gloating look at me Pe dro disappeared
lowflung shaft of light from the setting sun glinted upon the blue bottle and stared fascinated wondering if in truth might soon want the poison
Why had the idiot said Now that you look worse than me
remembered Doctor Koops comment concerning strange shrinkage that puzzled him
Did he mean my skin the wasting of my flesh
shuddered at thought of freakish hu man skeletons had seen struggled in blinding effort to gain control of my limbs almost succeeded
After had fallen back gasping upon TERROR TALES the psilow harrowing iir possessed me
Something was horribly wroi
must get up and away To Grace
What the ensuing effort to rise rost me in mental strain and mortal agony cmly God can realize
If there be such thing as actual power of mind over matter then it was that which in the end gave me emnmand of my musdes again
Striving to the point of deadly nausea beset in every joint by dreadful pains which nearly drove me mad at last fcMxed myself to sittit position swung my legs down frmn the bed
Clinging to the white iron framework made an effort to stand although at first my knees buckled miser ably
Dimly perceived the door of closet across the room
On hands and knees crawled to it seeking robe or other covering for my nakedness
reached for the knob three times and failed before could draw myself erect
Swa dng there found inside suit of my dothes which Grace must have brought as childish means of bolstering hope that cme day would wear them home
Draggmg gar ments from the hooks crawled back to tte bed again
After grueling ordeal of rising and seating myself drew on the dark grey trousers and maiKtged to stand
Dazedly stared down at their absurd length noting that the legs were at least foot toe longi Fumbling in the pockets found familiar purse
Yes indulntabty they were mine
Turning little then caught glimpse of my reflectioi in the glass of window that was closed
cry of horror burst across my lips at sight of the revolting figure there darkly revealed
dvrarfted and hairless monstrosity
My bald skull bulked far too large for the scrawny neck and stunted frame which supported it
Deepset eyes were gloomy cavems beneath my brow
My nearly fleshless jaws were those of Deaths head lips per thin and dghtly drawn
My broad shoulders had narrowed and were bunched like those of deformed child
My long and powerful legs were shrunken to sindling bony shanks from which the last vestige of strength was swiftly ebbing
Staring at the odious reflected sliape felt my reason sway
Locsii render ing screen toppled upon tlie floor and sank into bottomless abyss of blackness in which my sufferings were extinguished with the appalling slowness of creeping death
DUT lived
When next knew tViat deaths groping clutch had missed me it was to find myself again reposing in the hospital bed
Tbe voices heard and the xjken words dispelled an awful lethargy which gripped my brain but did not break the drains of weakness that shackled my leaden limbs
Ah God
cant bear to look at him It was my wifes despairing cry
No curse has done this
It fs the poison listened to her muffled sobs of horror
Doctor Hemerich Koop was spealdug but could not distinguish the things he said
When my eyes flicked open saw that he held Grace in his arms and was whispering with lips pressed close against her golden hair
She broke away and whirled to face him her cheela flushed with anger and dismay
You dare say such things to me
While Ralph Res dying As well say dead my dear for soon he shall be
And even though were to keep him alive would you not choose me small and ugly though am in prefer ence to the jellylike thing which was once man
He is watching us
See him quivering there like viscous blob upon the sheet You demon Grace screamed in chattering frenzy
Not Zell Mendez but you You did this HER SUITOR FROM HELL And why not
He stole your love from me As though ever could have loved hunched and evil creature am man Koop thumped his nar row chest proudly
am active and strong
My brain is fine
Look now at the one who thought himself superior
Is not Ralph Payne disgusting sight
He little resembles that father of tall sons and lovely daughters of whom you boasted Grace approached on laggard feet and stood beside my bed
Tears streaming she touched my torpid arm my bony face crying bitterly love him
His soul lives despite the ruin youve made of his magnificent body
Oh what have you done to him
What blight have you wrought Doctor Koop came near and hatred glowed in his eyes as he grinned down at me
It was master stroke he bragged
The strategy of using Zell Mendez and her halfwit spawn as pawns in my little game
For days on end she voiced her threats to all she met after the accident
There are fifty witnesses to swear that she contemplated the murder of Ralph Payne and made Pedro help her plan it
Now both are jailed accused of poison ing your husband by contaminating the swimming pool and no one ever shall hear of the clever operation that per formed upon his throat Grace stared and so did my powers of speech paralyzed as yet although my tongue curled and twisted in an effort to talk
You operated on Ralph
Why My wifes eyes were round with terror
Oh tell me what youve done to him
Is there no cure could cure him but at price you may not wish to pay
Another might if be were skilled in the science of the glands and knew what have done
Prevailing upon Pedro Mendez to hide nearby and toss bottle of common poison into the pool after frightening you let Ralph drink of drugged liquor from bottle brought knowing that wed have to rescue him from his dive
The numbing effect of the drug used is instantaneous
That gave me an excuse to bring him here to the hospital
With only simpleminded Cajun girl to help planted globule of metallic compound at the base of the para thyroid gland where it would immediately create sufficient pressure to halt the glands functioning
The result as you see
was swift decalcification of his bones shrinking of stature wasting of flesh
He is like thing of rubber and jelly now
as death approaches But he could be cured Grace plead ed
Oh say that he can be saved Of course
By removal of the pres sure
and with proper treatment in mat ter of months he might regain his normal size and health
But who shall grant him that boon my dear You shall
You say you love me
You must be kind
Restore him
Well forgive and forget
Stop this mad ness and use your skill to make him man again You heard my terms
mentioned price Koops smile was lecherous
He seized Grace in his arms and sought her lips
The price is yourself mine for al ways
And you must answer now jEVER shall forget the play of tor turing emotions that swept over my dear wifes face as she fought to submerge her revulsion to find the courage to en dure an odious ordeal
She gasped What do you mean for always
Not after he is well If grant him life Koop said harsh ly it must be without you and he shall never know
At best his mind might not TERROR TALES be restored cwnpletely
It do rso harm to make certain of that Coerprehoiding his horrible intention to render me witless hulk endowed witii life Grace tfcrew herself upon her knees and beaded piteously
Roughly Koop thrust her suppHont hands aside
If only wanted you now Id take you
It most be of your own free will and fM always Again weakening he bis skhmy arms about her and pressed his raisive lips to hers
Grace tore hetsdf free she strode him wkh her open palm and dropped in sdng hc upon die bed beside me
Let me die wkh Ralph moaned
Dont touch nse
Only let me Hemerich Koops swarthy face paled greyly
knew then that he had ex pected victory
Failure seeraed to drive him mad
Never you fool
Ill keep the pair of you alive so long as the spark can be held within your rotting bodies
You shall endure the same operation Grace mid in tum sh become as he is
Bones of rubber and flesh of jdly while your brain melts in harrowing helplessness
If you love him so you shall lie beside him and dream of the ecstasies that you win know no more Springing upon Grace Koop bound her hands ivith towel likewise her ankles
Dashing out of the room he returned with hypodermic fringe and plunged the needle into her arm
Soon my wifes froiaied strules ceased
Removing lier bonds Koop leaned across motionless body and peered into my startmg eyes
You know
can read the suffering there Both mast live to suffer endlessly
White watdi over you day by day and laugh at two steong lovers wJao eoited tall sons and lovely daughters His har mirth echoed in the room
He opened the door and called
Cenne here dulleyed Cajun girl appeared fear written large upon her stupid features
Koop exclaimed The lady is sick
You must help me operate He carried Grace out
The girl cast frightened look at me
thought her lips moved in settndtess pky that she felt an urge to render aid btrt stark terror held her captive and she foBowed Koop obedi ently
Once more set my mind to the task of making the fie
If only cotald move roll off the bed crawl to the room where Grace lay helpless beneatli his heH hands
This time coedd not
My greatest effort served only to elevate ragr head triffing way
But in that brief in stant downward glance encompassed my shrunken legs and groaned in trem bling horror
The two limbs lay coiled awry ion the sheet like rubber tubes in which no semWance of bone remaiaed
Koop had spoken truly
was but jd lylike blob of slowly liquefying matter that was scarcely flesh
The shock seemed to disintegrate iy brain and conscious ness faded
RACE was lying upon bed which had been moved into the room before awalsened
Some one had turned me upon my side so that might sec her there when the toqior lifted
white bandage encircled her throat and lier eyes were wide and starii
Both wrists and ankles were caught dose to the irem frasnework by broad straps to her prisoner
Her quiverkig lips formed whispered query Ralph
Can you hear me
Can you speak For long moments fou the rigidity of throat mitsdes then croaking worda grated across my dry tth
Yes heu
Oh God
see He operated on me
Soon shall HER SUITOR FROM HELL as ymi orsl The dread sentice of doom gushed out of her very soul gulp of anguish
How long gasped
week he sa before the gland is aeriou affected
Oh there is ao hope Koops voice sounded at the doorway
His hateful vise was framed there grinning
Oh yes there is my dear
might yet reconsider within the week you de cide that life with me is preferable to liv ing putrescence found the strength to curse him to utter threatening prophecies of retribu tion
Doctor Koop only smiled
You have revived considerably as result of treatment last mght while you were unconscious want you stronger that you may suffer morel While you lie there waiting watching He stepped away to Graces bed threw back the coverlid tore her gown away
Lust gleamed in his hot eyes but hunger for vengeance and the will to torture pre vailed
He turned aside muttering fVatchmffI Seeing her lovely form shrivel and shrink
Therell be wrinkles and bony angles where you knew curves and tender maidens flesh
Love will be smothered in revulsion as you watch each other disintegrate and become two dwarfed disgusting thills with only brain cells hvir Kocp went out saying as he departed Soon the treatment will make you rav enously hungry Payne
In an hour or so rU bring you food and feed you with my own hands
For you must Kve
To see and suffer
His brittle ladbter edioed from distance
Grace was weeping
could think rf no cheering thing to say
Stupefied lay resigned to the inevitable
But soon experienced faiat soisation oi hfe of tkodatiei in the atm which ky cnisfaed beneath my body
Koops remark flashed across my mind
You will be stroir
The treatment last night Hepe flared faintly
Strong enough to move to crawl to exhaust the last famt spark of life force seeking aid for Grace
thoiht of our isolated positiem in ffie swamp then remembered the tele phone
But the instrument in the outer oflice might as well have
been miles away
Feverishly my frantic brain strug ed with the problem of what mitt be done if found some vntige strength restored
My wandering gare paused at ffie nearest window
An ktea sprat into being
Grace exclatml
There may be fighting diance
If you could free an arm or leg
Try it Pitifully she looked at me and shook her head but urged frantically Try
Twist and try Grace began to writhe to ti and struggle
Faint moans of pain escaped her titdrawn lips as the straps cut skin and flesh
At last said Ive one foot loose
But Rph cant do any niwe Plant your heel against the wall cried
Push hard
Force your bed against mine and shove me nearer to the window
Its ojily matter of inches Grace succeeded in doing wliat asked
Our beds collided and the impulse of her thrust skidded my cot against tlie window sill rolling me upon my back as made desperate effort in that direction
Ly ing there then tried to move my hands found new life tlie finger tips but none in my arms
Slowly gropiily nails scratching at the bed linen and mind sav ely intent upon aeoimplishment draped one hand in fractional jerks across the sheet onto the window ledge and seized ffie tiny bottle that Pedro Mendes had hidden there
The trivial mtucukr feat that fcowed
TERROR TALES exhausted me more than can express
With the prize precariously clutched be tween thumb and forefinger worked my hand back by the power of fingertips alone until it reached my body
Three at tempts made to raise that left arm and failed
Then like crawling worm made it creep across my chest until it met the other
In little while when the cold sweat of weakness beaded my brow and nearly all my strength was spent with my right hand laid the vial in Graces palm
Her fingers closed upon it
What It means escape exdaimed
Hide dont understand Her eyes sought nune
rolled my head and whispered It is poison rjOCTOR HEMERICH KOOP came later bearing well laden tray
His forecast was correct knew the pangs of hunger but the viands he carried inter ested me less than the bottle of wine
Placing the food upon table he turned to smile at Grace and said Youve hurt yourself struggling
One strap was poorly fastened
Why not agree to my proposals and have them all off My wife looked up at him long and moodily
One could scarcely recognize her voice when chokingly she said cant bear itl To be Hke him
Oh Godl cant You mean Doctor Koop leaned above her eagerly
That you have counted the cost of hopeless love for the thing that he has become My love is dead she stormed hj terically
was faithful was true
But Ralph Payne is gone
There remains only
that She swung her eyes toward me and quickly looked away
Koop exclaimed Then youTl come to me
Oh this Is glorious Awkwardly in his haste he fumbled at the straps which bound her
Casting them aside he caught Grace in his arms and helped her to arise
My dear one
My lovely one he gloated
Always Ive watched you wanted you
And now you are mine With shuddering sigh Grace pushed his pawing hands aside forced shrill laugh crying Yours shall be but dont ever call it love
Its the price must pay Have it your own way he snapped
So long as you do pay Dont be angry Grace pleaded
am upset and unnerved
Perhaps littie of that wine He snatclied up the bottle smiling again
Of course
Its just the thing Pouring two glasses he raised one and turned to me in mock salute
Now Ralph Payne youll have sane thing more to watch
Heres to greater suffering Grace lowered the glass from her lips face white as death exclaiming Drink your toast to me
Have not deserved it Koops countenance split an evil grin
Youre improving my dear
WcU get along famously Grace took his glass half emptied and gave him hers
The better to seal our bargain Hemer ichl she cried and laugh like an echo from hell rattled upon her bloodless lips
Koop tossed off the drink at gulp
He started violently
terrible tremor shook his scrawny frame from head to foot
Collapsing he screamed Poison rpHE man expired before he struck the floor
Grace crashed her glass inst HER SUrrOR FROM HELL the wait aad swaged as though she might The door opened

We held our breath while negotiating it And then we saw the lights of our destination

Private residence hotel or whatever it might be it perched like an eagles nest high on the crags with the rivergorge in hairpin turn almost sur rounding it
Eerie location indeed with these wild lightless defiles slashed and broken stormswept by rain and wind of gale force now

The lights of its windows were blurred yellow blobs through the torrential rain

The voice by its very unexpectedness was horribly startling

He was without hat and outer coat evidently seeing our approaching headlights as we toiled up the grade he had come out to greet us

The young lady must be cold He left us standing on the threshold of the open door while against my protes tations he carried in our two suitcases
We saw dim hallway with electric lamps heavily shaded
tall brownhaired young woman in maids uniform stood watching us
And suddenly there was the distant sound of girls laughter instantly checked
It echoed through the silent in terior and there was about it so eerie quality that Edith and stared at each other wordlessly and the maid whirlii at the soimd hurried instandy away
Dr Emil Groff came with our suitcases
Most horrible night my friends
shall put your car away later
Were shorthanded tonight
My nurse is on holiday and my man went to Chattanooga for supplies
fear the storm may keq him away for tonight What was this place
saw this Dr Groff now as man of perhaps forty
burly sixfoot fellow with head of closeclipped black hair smoothshaven face of rugged somewhat handsome features
He stood fingering black eyeglass ribbon that hung around his neck his dark gaze from deepset eyes under heavy black brows seemed appraising me
Oh yes said awkwardly
It cer tainly is bad night told him our name Baker and that we were traveling from Florida to Chi cago
He listened with very queer grave smile faintly pulling at his mouth and abruptly he interrupted me
Well am honored that you came here Mr Baker
We shall make you comfortable this storm no one could travel these mountains night like this His gaze clung to Ediths dark slim beauty
He added We are glad to have you my dear young lady
We will do everything possible to make you happy madhouse here in this wild lonely mountain fastness
This man himself one of the inmates
Thoughts may run wild very fast
Edith took an invol untary step backward as though his words were physically repelling and she flung me startled questioning glance
Then before could speak he had turned to me
understand you Mr Baker His lowered voice and his bulk momentarily exduded Edith who was few feet from us
Your sister needs attention
Later we will discuss the de tails OWN that my wits were scattered
ttw the brownhaired maid in her LAUGH AND DIE
biack and white umform again sending near ua
mmered Wi we dont want to intrude Dr Groff
reafly thought this was ho tel My one wild wish then was to get Edith out of here storm or no storm
he said
Well yes you might call it that
Of course your stay will be brief supper only perhaps if the storm dimimshes
When my man returns will ha him fix your car
He is very good mechanic The maid said Shall take tliem up stairs Dr Groff Yes Millie
Just temporary rooms
They may leave after supper
ITl bring up their hjge The maid touched Ediths arm
Come miss She said it gently but firmly as one would talk to child
And again Groff was leaning close to me
Naturally they dont like the idea of permaaeney
Thats almost always the case Edith the patient to be humored upon her admittance here
smiled with re lief
Look he said youve got us all wrong Dr Groff
Is this hoital
didnt realize it
assure you theres nothing wrong with my sister Certainly this fellow was no madman
He saw that Edith could not hear me now that could not possibly be talking for her benefit He looked startled and disappointed
He said did not understand you
It is so almost impossible for any one to arrive here by chance But we did said and smiled
sudden vue hostility had come to him
His gaze had an appraising suspicion in it addfed Wc wont intrude further His BosptcicMi seemed to vanish
No inbsstcm Ite said
This is Groff Hatf
We receive patients who are depressed
Melancholic shall say
My treatment has proven very efficacious
There is hap piness here Certainly nothing very sinister for all its weird morbidness
said well then if we might have lodging until the storm is past Of course he agreed
My charges are reasonable and we have plenty of room Oh my wife
Dr Agatha Groff
This is Mr Baker and bis sister
Not patients they were lost in the storm woman in bladt load approached us
Despite my polite endeavor to smile as took her extended hand an inward shudder swept me
The woman was of indeterminate age certainly older than her stalwart husband little hunched thickset figure no taller than my shoul der gorillalike with long thick arms
He dress was stiff black taffeta wkh white ruching around her short neck where her head set down between wide hunched shoulders
The dress gave an incongruous air of primness carried also by her black hair streaked with grey primly parted in tlie middle plastered down and rolled into knot at the back
But it was her face that most startled me
Sharp hatchet feattires and for all her smile new there was so intent malevolence in her face that caught my breath
You are welccane She bad the same guttural accent as her husband
Her hand gripping mine was like roughened scaly daw
Then she turned to where Edith stood gajAig
You are welcome my dear Her little glittering eyes seemed feasting on Ediths dark slhn beauty die sucked in her breath with an audfele hiss
Wl my dear child you are beautiful eau tiful We presently followed the maid up stairs
Edith grilled my arm
TERROR TALES Well go right after supper
Yes NOISE of the storm was far more apparent up here on the second floor
The slap and pound of the rain on the roof was audible
Gusts of wind as though this were tropical hurricane rattled the old building from end to end
dim upper hallway confronted us with ft number of bedrooms opening from it The maid turned to dosed door al most at the head of the staircase
She said This will suit you Mr Baker
Two connecting rooms
Tliere is plenty of choice
We have only two other pa tients just now She had quiet dignity this maid
An intelligentlooking handsome girl of about twenty
Wliat could have been her dark ftnd tragic history tliat made her part of this wild place
have often wondered
Other patients said
Were not patients
Were leaving right after sup per As though the storm were hurlipg de fiance at my words there came sudden sizzling lightning flash and crack of thunder with it
The lurid glare showed through window at the distant end of tfie hall
The electric lights of the house simultaneously vanished so that for that bisant saw the figures of Edith and the maid painted greenwhite and the de crepit hallway an inferno of glare
Then the hall lights flickered on again
The thunder rolled away into the distance like ft grumbling retreating giant
Edith gasped Good heavens that was dose We have bad storms in these moun tains sometimes the maid said
She stood with her hand on the bedroom door her gaze on Edith
Youre going after supper
Youre not sick No Edith said and tried to smile Im not From one of these upper bedrooms near us now again came that eerie chill ing burst of laughter
So close to us it seemed two girls laughing behind one of these closed doors
Laughter so queer so wildly unnaturally strange that to the listener there could not seem any quality of mirth in it but only horror
saw the maid stiffen she took an involuntary step toward the sound
Then she changed her mind and swung on us
Youre going right after supper
She was breathless with furtive lowered voice
On the nearby stairs Dr Groff was starting up with our suitcases
You do tliat the maid added swifdy
You never mind tlie storm you get your sister out of here Yes agreed
gripped her shoul der as bent toward her
Millie tell me bedroom door diagonally across the hall burst open
From it two young girls came running
The hall light shone on their slim pinkwhite beauty their bodies clad in brief filmy undergarments their hair wildly flowing
They staggered to gether into the hall clinging to each oth er wildly laughing in paroxysm of ma cabre mirth
Then they saw Millie as she sprang for them
We want Mrs Groff they screamed
Where is Mrs Groff
Isnt it time Millie was struggling with them
No not time yet
You go back
You shouldnt have done that You stop it She shoved them back into the roan and banged the door on them
But their wild screaming laughter still sounded
Edith and stood frozen
Gruesome un holy laughter
What was this gliastly thing
CHAPTER TWO Lurking Rend MORE than five minutes had passed
Dr Emil Groff had brought mp our suitcases with his face stolidly LAUGH AND DIE
inscrutable ignoring that brief wild ap pearance of the two laughing girls
In the hall he had murmured few words to Millie with glance at the nearby door behind which the girls now were si lent
caught fragment of the maids answer locked them in Then Dr Groff had come to our door
Supper will be ready presently
Come down soon He left us he and the maid descended the stairs
Edith stood shuddering
took look around the two small bedrooms
They were meagerly but comfortably furnished
Each had single window and door to the hall and there was connecting door between them
peered from one of the windows
Solid blackness with only the wild rage of the storm
But could see enough to realize that there was sheer drop from these windows down into the canyon upon the brink of which the house was perched
Those girls Edith murmured when went back to her
Whatever this macabre mystery could see no sense of talking about it
Heaven knows Edith was frightened enough
Ill get us out of here right after sup per said
Then we heard car arriving
Not the manservant from Chattanooga for as we silently moved out to the head of the stairs the visitors were visible down in the lower hall
Dr Groff and Millie greeting party of three
Two men and girl
One of the men was elderly grey haired
He seemed ill he stood mo ment thi Millie brought chair in which he sat down while the other man talked with Dr Groff
This other man was young in his thirties doubtless stalwart fellow with smooth black hair
The girl had taken off her hooded cloak
The hall light gleamed on her palegold tresses
She was small no older than Edith and extremely beautiful
thought suddenly of the way Dr Groffs deformed hag of wife had stared at the dark slim beauty of Edith
Was this new arrival another possible victim
An aura of wealth was upon these three latest visitors
They came upstairs in moment
At the staircase head they turned down the hall in the other direction so that they did not pass our door but the girls voice floated to us Youre not too tired father We were presently ready to go dowm to supper
As we started it seemed that amid all the noises of the outside storm heard footsteps pattering away in the upper hall
Wait here minute The dim lull was empty but ten feet or so beyond the locked door where Millie had shoved the two girls the hall turned right angle to the left into anotlier wing of the building
ran there
The hall beyond the angle was almost dark
Thirty feet from me it seemed that saw shadow blob of dark indistinguishable shape disappearing into doorway
rilS section of the hall was heavily carpetal
padded noiselessly for ward into the deepening darkness
It wasnt doorway into which the sliadow had plunged but the top of steep flight of descending back stairs
Solid black ness
But down at the bottom there was vertical slit of light which marked door
The slit was narrowing the door evidently just being closed by whoever it was had been following
The door stopped ajar and abruptly heard dim voices
They were muffled blurred by the confined space and the sounds of the storm but caught fragments of the words
You Ludvig what are you doing lRROR TALES No busmess of yours
Who was it who oanje The Forrests
The old man and Rolf Forrest his nephew
And the old mans dauiter came It was Emil Groff talking felt sure of tliat
Then Ludvig said His daughter saw herpalfi hut somehow glowing like burnished gcJd
Stop that you fool
YouB get us into troubte with your devitisb You talk Eke fftat to mel Emil you dare talk like that Yes do
lia going to stojp tell you
These two damnable girisfwhen they die thats the end
Well have no nuMn in this houseT Get ns into trouble There was wild cadthog fellah
This Ludvig whose authority Emil now was challenging was this nKuuac nr something near it
Get us mto trouble
Worse than your muiders Emil
Worse than eses Wg money fn that you focd
These Fosre are rich Its be care fully pknoed so there is no daiir to us in it This young fellow Rolf Forrest You go to hell Ludwig suddenly rasped
You cant control me youll do what teM you as you always have
Who owns tins building
Whose mcm set yon in business here Again that wild chucklmg laughter
You dare to tell me what shall dol Its plsure Emil
What is life without pleasure It seemed suddenly that they were scuf fling
The door at the foot of these back stairs clicked closed as one cd dietn buned against it and the sounds were shut from me
With my heart pottnd ing went back to Edith
maniac loose here
Thus Ludvig lurking here never showing himself intent only on hts lust for scmie weird fentastlc pleasure
Edith was still at our bedroom door
Jack what was it Nothing said
Swne one may have been up here went down the back stairs didnt see anybody In minute or two vrt left tlic room
Muffled eerie laughter was coming again from the bedroom in whidi the two girls were locked
In spite of ourselves we stood moment shudderingly listening to it Then we desceitded the front stair case
In the front lower hall Mrs Groff came forward to meet us
Ah my dear children you are ready
Come in to supper She stood in her prim black taffda smiling at tis ingratiatingly
Hideous lit tle woman
travesty of wonianhood like grinning fanale gargoyle
won dered then if my reyolted impressioiw of her were not inspired by the mere mis fortune of her deformed physical ugli ness
Certainly she seemed trying to be pleasant
She fed us akmg the back lower hall to the dining room where dozen broad tables stood devoid qf setting
You have very few patients just now said Yes only two Millie serves them in their room
And party of three who will dine with you The table here in corner of the din ing room was set for six
The Forrests came now and when the introductions were over Mrs Groff said My hus band he expected to be your host but he is detained My thoughts leaped
He was stiff hav ing troubte with Ludvig
Why was there no mention of this Ludvig
Mrs Groff added But Dr Groff will join you presently
As for me must hdp MilHe She smiled her grimace upon us all
She saM This terrible storm we will do our best for you She moved off to the kitchen and Mil lie served ns
Five of us with one empty chair like spectre in our midst
We were in truth strange little gathering
LAUGH AND DIE
Old Mr Forrest man with the aura of wealth and the blight of illness so ob viously upon him
Rolf Forrest his nephew stalwart darkly handsome fel low with an arrogant swagger that wealth had doubtless given him
And Anne Forrest
To her most of my interest went
She was sitting beside me hair of pale gold faultless com plexion face beautiful as cameo
Beautiful as Edith
Amazing contrast these two girls the dark slim Latin beauty of Edith inherited from our mother and this Anne like little fra gile flower of the north
NEED not detail our conversation during the meal
It was strained awkward as though each of us might be engrossed with thoughts that could not be voiced
Edith and told the mis adventures which had landed us there
And the others explained that old Mr Forrest had come here for his health nervous depression which had come upon him from overwork in Nashville
shall be lonely here he said som berly
But only for week or two uncle Rolf Forrest said
Then youll be so well well come and get you and take you back Anne Forrest spoke hardly word
But when the meal was nearly over at moment when the others were talking with Edith she suddenly leaned toward me
And caught her agitated murmur must see you alone tonight please Yes murmured
had for the time forgotten that Edith and were leaving tonight
admit was attracted with singular swiftness to the fragile golden beauty of Anne For rest
Whatever menace was here in this sinister household certainly it was di rected at this other girl not at Edith
And her whisper now was appealing
She added You and your sister Im frightened must talk to you Rolf Forrest was saying Yes we ex pected Anne and to go back to Nash ville tonight
But the accursed bridge is down no way of getting out of here for anybody not till daylight It brought gasp from Edith and it snapped me to alertness
Marooned here
Why said nobody told us thjt My sister and were leaving tonight Young Forrest shrugged
Not chance
You came over that bridge you know the one like trestle nearly falling down of its own weight He gestured
Just down the cliff hun dred feet or so
That lightning flash
Lord wed only just gotten over the bridge when the lightning hit it He laughed
suppose it was quite normal laugh but it sent shudder over me as though any form of laughter in this mysterious house must carry horror
That bridge he added just slid sidewise and fell looked to Anne for confirmation and she nodded
Mrs Groff was approaching helping Millie with the dessert
My husband has just been to verify the wreck of the bridge she said
It is down
On foot one might get around the canyon to the other road by daylight but it is many miles Marooned here
With the palegold beauty of Anne Forrest beside me own that at that moment it did not seem so horrible catastrophe
If had known would have taken Edith and Anne and run out on foot to huddle through the night among the black stormswept crags if had known
CHAPTER THREE Murder Stalks tLL Im not going to sleep Edith said
Well take turns keeping awake TERROR TALES agreed
Jttst aa matter of precaution
But dont lets get too tense over it laugbed slwrtly and was startled to see Edith flash me look as thougli to her too the sound of laughter here was frightening
Mysterious damn jdaee added
MeianchoHa patients
Thats morbid enough for anybody but dont see any danger to us
said it lightly enough but the things Imew that Edith didnt know again leaped at me
Tlie luihing Ludvig
third member of this Groff family
The One who held the purse strings lustful fiend who must not be seen by us visitors or even mentioned
Demoniac with his desires unspeakable so tudeous that even Enifl Groff was revolted at thn afraid of he cftaequent
Yet Emil himself had beeaond perhaps was now en gaged in mttrder
And thought of the appeal of Anne Forrest Something was threatening her so that in her terror she had ajealed to me strMiger
had had no opportunity yei of seeing Anae alone
After supper we had all gone into elieerless little siltii room
It was by then laearly nine oclock
We sat for perhaps half an hour discussing the storm which stlH was raging
Queer storms these of the Tonuefisee mountains
The lightning bolt which had demolished the ramshackle brid was the last
No more had ome
But the wind was still high and the min was still torrent
It seemed that Anne was watching an opportunity to talk to me alone but could not find it
Then her father seemed tired
They wnt to their bedrooms with the hunchback Ihtle Mrs Groff escorting them to be sure they were comfortable and Edith and totlowed
At the top of the stairs as we all said goodnight seemed that Anne flashed me glpnce but whatever her meaning could not determine it
You caai sleep if you like Edith was saying
And Im staying here with you not iti my room We sat together in one of the bedrooms
We had closed and locked the hall doors of both rooms and left tlie connecting door betwttn thesn en
The hotise had goite almost immediately silent
There was up here on this floor with us as far as we knew only the two girls iodced the bedroom diagonally across the hall and the Forrests who had three adjacent bedrooms on this upper hall just beyond the front staircase
Those two girls whose unholy laughter was so shocking to hear sat wondering whether Millie had taken their supper if any attention were being paid to them
They were silent now silence that somehow seined more ominous even than their bloodcWUing laughter
Te Groffs and Millie were downstairs so far as knew perhaps their bedrooms were down there
Emil Groff liad not appeared
And that Ludwig found that was doaing with drifting thoughts
If only were anned
Some weapon but had none save very in effectual peaknife
But mustnt mention it to Edith
Tomorrow would see Anne again That hndvig would he be roaming the house now
Tlie thotaght snaed me into alertness
What is it Jack
Nothing Edith Hadnt you better lie down on the bed
Ill stay awake No
Im all right here
Abruptly the small electric bulb in the roMii was ejrtmguished
We were plunged into darioiess
Jackr Sit still murmured Probably itll come on in minute But it did not
AU through the stonn the lights of the bouse had been waverii but now It seemed permanent
LAUGH AND DIE
THE darkness crowded us frightened against all reason
could hear Ediths terrified breathing her hand reached out and gripped my arm
Oh Jack Esy said
There was stump of candle on the table
guess the lights up here in these mountains are never very dependable fumbled and found the candle lighted it
Even its wavering tiny yellow glow was reassuring
Then startling thought hit me
The light was out in our adjoining room
The storm during the last half hour had seemed rapidly abating
The rain had ceased the wind was still strong but noticably less than before and outside our windows now there was fitful moon light
Queer that having weathered the storm the lights would go out now
Were they out all over die house or just in our two rooms
Had someone pulled out fuse to plunge us and all the house per haps into darkness
went to the bedroom door with Ediths gaze upon me
What is it
Jack Just want to see if the lights are out in the hall The little hall was solidly dark
Evi dently every light in the house was ex tinguished
And there was new silence here now black empty silence with the rattle of rain on the roof missing and the surge of the wind almost gone so that now the silence was blank unnatural
stood straining my hearing
Was that dim choking sound of laughter
turned to Edith
Those girls said softly laughing again Was it laughter
Or something else now
On impulse crossed diagonally to the door on the other side of the hall
Behind me Edith stood framed in our doorway by the candlelight
reached the other doorway
It was soft eerie
choked laughter
bent with my ear to the wooden panel
And heard blur of confused sounds
The thump of the girls moving about
And queerly gruesome sounds of their suppressed voices
Giggles laugh choking into sob
thump with revolting giggling little scream
With wild rtmning thoughs straight ened to return to Edith
And frozen
stood tense with dilating nostrils
What was this was smelling
drift from under the girls door
faint weird smell of which had suddenly become aware
Inde finable went back to Edith closed our bed romi door and locked it
There in there said
Just the same laughing poor little devils maniacs There must have been some look on my face that stopped her questioning
did not meet her gaze
Lie down Edith added
The night will seem interminable if you just sit there Im all right Half an hour
It did indeed seem an eternity as sat alone with my question ing thoughts
Beside me fn little wood en rocker with bed pillow behind her Edith was dozing
And suddenly in the silence heard tap on our bedroom door
Edith sat up staring at me wordlessly
The tap came again
Dont open it Edith warned as rose
At the door said softly Who is it
What you want Mr
Oh please Annes voice
jerked open the door and she came in like white darting wraith the light of the candle she was carrying paint ing her head and neck with its yellow glow
TERROR TALES Tfow Edith gasped and as snatdied the candk Anne ran to Edith with Httie xxy
Oh Tve been so lightened had to come to yoo
When the lights went out while agoI jst txjnldnt stand its had to come She was rfinng mth coM and terror Edith led her to the bed and sat there with arms aromid her
What is it dear
Youre frightened
WeH of course this ghastly house
TtiST girl terrified at being alone in this weird ac so ttiat she was Jm pelkd to seek protection from us strangers even though her father and cousin were here with her
Ediths glance questioned me
said gently couldnt make any oppfsrtunity to talk with you
thought tomorrow TtfinDrrSw may may be too late she gasped
tOi suppose its just my silly fears
This thra ghasdy house as you say
Btit was afraid even before Rolf brought father and me up here My mind flung back to that altercation had heaid at the foot of the stairs just before supper
Emil Groff and the mys terious Ludwig
These Forrests are rich
Its all been carefully plaimed
Your cousin Rolf brout you up here demanded
Father was taken ill sort of nervous breakdown
Depressed threat ened with wbat they call melancholia
Then Rolf found this jfece
He came up here to inspect it
Tb ffiey cure people here who have melancholia She sucked in her breath
Depressed insanity thats what th call it when it gets worse
And Rolf Kiid that die cure here was wonderful and he persuaded father to come Ie Kttle light in distant darkness began to understand
Your father is rich said gently
She stared
Yes And she added wiffi stark note of terror in her voice Youre guessing what Fm thinking
Its only ray imagination maybe but Ive always been alraid of Rolf
He wants to marry me dont love him Afraid for yourself inuimured
Afaaid for father
My father said hed never let Rolf marry me
And tiieres the business the inheritance
Rolf is general manager now but father doesnt like his work
They they qtiarrded few weeks ago and fatlier threatened to have Rolf leave dte busineK and to change liis will niayte Murder for price So that was what Emil Groff was after Big money in it no danger to us all carefully plannetb This place murder house where one might bring his intended victim to be killed little of this grewsome sinfeter mysfory one angle of it at least now seemed plain
said sviffly
Is your father sleejHag alone now Yes
He has one bedroom Rolfs is adjoining with door between them
Mine is nt to Rolfs
No door between you and Rolf No
And got terrified just think ing
Oh wliat are you going to do
had seized one of the candles
Vake your father up said
Well have to plan some way lo guard him In truth had no plan save that could not let tlat old man sleep in there alone now
If only had weapon
saw now so many adversaries tonight in this sinister household
Emil Groff in tent upon murdering this victim aided no doubt by liis malevolent gargoyle wife
And Rolf Forrest here to see the murder accomplished and to take the body back home with Dr Groffs death certificate
And the lurking fiendish Ludvig what part would he play in this
Both the girls were clinging to me
said LAUGH AND DIEI Well figure out some excuse to guard your father
Well tell him you got too frightened to stay alone
Then Edith and will stay with you and him They followed me clinging to me as opened our door and raised the candle to light the dark and silent hallway
It was only fifty feet to the bedroom of Annes father
We passed the front hall stairs
No sound
The wavering little light from my candle shone partly down the stairs with solid blackness in the lower hall
This is your fathers door Anne Yes rapped softly
said softly Mr
Forrest oh Mr Forrest wake up The silence was wnlnous
Ter rifying
The old door rattled slightly as though from puff of wind behind it
turned its knob and shoved but it did not yield it was locked on the inside
Anne you call him Edith murmured
Father dear No answer though rapped again much louder
It was loud enough now to arouse Rolf
turned to the adjacent door
This Rolfs Yes thumped
Rolf Forrest
Let me ini This is Jack Baker
Let me in No answer
turned the knob
The unlocked door went inward with my shove and burst into the room with the girls behind me
It was unlighted save by an eerie shaft of moonlight from the window and now the light of my candle
The bed had not been occupied
Rolf Forrest was not here
To one side was the closed com mimicating door to the bedroom of Annes father
dashed to it turned its knob
It swung and went through
GUST of wind met me extinguishing my candle
The window was wide open with moonlight streaming in and blast of the night air
Annes father lay in the bed with the covers to his chin
He seemed to be peacefully sleeping
bent over him
Pallid face in the moonlight
Behind me the girls were shuddering
said Mr
Forrest wake up shook him insistently with wave of dis may sweeping me because knew it was futile
Then swung
You girls step back
He hes fainted guess
Anne gave little cry and Edith drew her back
Both of them knew what meant
He lay here unbreathing
jerked down the window sash saw out side that sheer drop of hundred feet or more down to the little canyon of the mountain torrent
Then turned back to the bed
Dead unquestionably
Yet so far as could tell no mark of violence on him
No blood
No wound
No sign even tliat the bedclothes liad been rumpled
No contortion of the face nor the muscles of the limbs as one who dies by poison
What had done this
What mysterious agency of murder was this to leave peaceful unmarked corpse which Rolf Forrest could take back to Nashville and offer for autopsy perlmps secure that no evidence of murder would exist
As though to answer my unspoken question it seemed now that despite the opened window and the blast of night air there was vague smell in the room
Indefinable Dead said gently
The two hor rified girls were staring at me from the communicating doorway
shoved them back into Rolfs room and closed the door on the moonlit scene of death
We were too late Anne And what were we to do now
So many lurking adversaries here The hall door of Rolfs little bedroom TERROR TAIS still was open
And abruptly all three of us stood here in the dim moonlight frozen with new surge of horror
From out side in the hall there came the sound of drsing
slow labored scraping on the hall floor sound so grewsomely hor rible that stood transfixed lioldkig the two juddering girls and with my breath seeming to stidc in my throat my Kps dry
The sound stopped
Came again
little louder as though nearer
Tiny muffled thumps mingled with dragging scrape
Something out there in the hall dragging itself toward
was hardly aware that had moved to the door stood virith the girls huddling against me so that we crowded the door way wUh the moonlit room behind us
The distant hall was blank darkness from out of whkh the sound was coming
The moonlight scrawled past us and laid its wan pallid glow on the hall floor in little patch just before our door
Tlie blackness was wall beyond it
Ghasfly approaclung dragging tlmmps there in the blackness
With rush of terror so shocking to my senses tliat the grisly scene swam and blurred before nie saw down by the flaer head appear
head of straggling long brown hair vild and tangled
disembodied head
face livid whiter contorted with mortal agony smeared with blood wild ring eyes mouth with parted life like crimson smear MilGe
For all the noisome horror was consefous of ray recognition
The Groff maid her disembodied head hob bling here
No there was ghastly throat now and wliite shoulders with the brown hair tangled on them
Another dragging labored hitch saw now her pitiful body lying on the flow emerging into the moonlight patch as slowly she dragged herself hitchittg on one elbow
tried tb shove Edith and Anne belnnd me but like me they were staring with shocked whirling senses
Millie dragging herself here in death agony lier throat crimson gash with tlie blood stream ing draining She saw me now
Her hand tried to gesture her spiiig dying breath choked with blood was andible and was aware that had flung off tlie girls and was bending over her
Millie Hes dead
ju fcamd him mur dered his tltroat cut like mine
Oh and loved him so much Millie
Whos dead
Who murdered him Her head Iiad faflcn now
The blood rattled in her throat
Then other words came He murdered him and did for me just now
Hell murder everybody
He is The words rattled off into the lant choldng agony of her death
Her whole body twitched for moment then lay still her white citeek the floor with spreading crimson stain under if
CHAPTER FOUR Room of the Maniac Girls TlURDER stalking in the blackns of this ghastly household
Old Mr Forrest dead here in his bed
Mfllicf here in the hall with slashed throat
And some one else was murdered Millie hod said
Some one whose body Millie had found lying somewhere here in the dark some man Millie loved
Who was it
The fiendish Ludvig
Dr Emil Groff
Or Rolf Forrest
And who had mur dered him
Hell murder everylxidy
He is The choking words of the dying girl echoed in my head as leaped to my feet
Lurking stalldng fiend roaming this house with the frenzy Of these murders LAUGH AND DIE turning him into raging madman so tliat now he would not stop until he had mur dered us all
And was unarmed
seized the pallid trcmMing Anne and Edith shoved them through the doorway of the room Anne had teen occupying
It had no cortimuni catii door into at other room
It was smj compact
Its single window over looked sheer drop into the canyon no chance of an assailant coming through the window
Barricaded in here we would be se The bed was smaU narrow iron affair
weapon for me
Edith gasped What are you doing
Help me tumbled the bedding to the floor
Snatched off the mattress
Lifted out the spms
jerk and had detached from its slot one of the iron side rails of the frame
It was nearly evcn feet long with it could crack tlie head of any orre or anything that came near me
frenzied panic for action was upon me
turned to the girls
You lode yourselves in here
Theres telephone near the foot of ffie stairs
Im gping to call for help the police in the nearest tovn
wont be minute
Well barricade ourselves in here Or siiouM we run from the house out to the windswept crags
More danger ous inside or ocrtside
Who could say yet to me then it seemed that we would be safer locked in this room than in the open moonlit wildness outside
You lock the door reiterated
Dont open it unless you hear my voice They nodded wordlessly
stood with the iron bedrail in my hand listening as they Icwked the door
This silent house
The grisly corpse of Millie lay at my feet
Brooding black silence everywhere
Amazing silence
Edith and Anne had screamed at the horrible sight of the dying Millie and certainly had made enough clatter snatching apart the bed
Yet the house stood unaroused darkly silent
Where were all its other occupants
Two maniac girls still locked doubtless in their bedroom up here at the other end of the hall
But Rolf Forrest
Mrs Groff
Emil Groff and Ludvig
One of them Millie had said was murdered
But the others
Where were they now that my commotion had not aroused them
Had they vanislied like spectres
Or like Siil lie were tliey all lyir here somewhere murdered
All but one
And that one somewhere here was lurkiflg
From the stairs could see faint shafts of moonlight now dimly illumining the lower hall
No one nothing down there
stood on the stairs with tlie heavy bed rail poised straining my hearii as though by force of wffi could penetrate the silence and hear this monstrous ad versary
At the bottom of the steps stood peering
Wan eerie patches of moonliglit by the windows and so many shadows everywhere each of which might hold the lurking monster
There was little moonlight glow by the wall telephone
Witli every muscle alert went there rested the heavy iron bar beside me and lifted the receiver
Un canny silence of the instrument like the uncanny silence of the house
No buzz of current no distant operators inquiring voice
And then saw the cut wires dangling under the box
The fiend had been here
could send no call for hp
With deepened sense of terror seized the bed rail and fled back up the stairs
At the door of Annes room rapped
called sliarply Its Jack let me in And as the words were still echoing felt my heart contract as though as icy hand were clutchihg it
silence TERROR TALES so fraught with horrible import that it whirled and blurred my senses
Let me in
Answer me Edith Silence so horrible
pounded the door rattled its ktrob
Then stepped back ward half stumbling over the gruesome body of Millie and lunged with the heavy bedrail
The wooden casement that held the lock smashed inward
The door swung and went with it
HE little moonlit bedroom was empty
The window locked on the inside was undisturbed But Edith and Anne wwe gone
stark panic descended upon me in that terrible moment so that lunged and flung aside the heap of bedding shoved wildly at the bureau as though by some diabolic necromancy the two girls might still be here though at glance had seen they were not
And then saw where they had gone
panel of the wall showed narrow slit slidir door here which when closed was undiscemable
But it was not quite closed now
doorway to some descending secret lair
shoved my fin gers into the vertical opening the panel slid sidewise and launched myself through brandishing the bedrail
was merely in the adjoining bed room duplicate of Annes with white iron bed unmade moonlight through the closed window
No one here
stooped hurriedly searching
No one
The rooms single door was ajar it ad mitted me back into the hall only few feet from Millies body
So great terror was on me now that was hardly conscious of rational reas oning
Where had the fiend taken them
Somewhere in this ghastly house Lud vig lusting for pleasure lusting for the white beauty of young womanhood
The room up here in which the two maniac girls were confined
Had the fiend taken Edith and Anne there
Had the maniac girls come out and lured them
dashed to that other door
It still was locked
listened with ear to its panel
No sound
There was only my own panting breath and thumping heart
With the bedrail burst in the door
Ghastly scene
Disheveled room of these maniac girls
Filmy garments strewn and scattered
place of lusting pleasure mute now with death
Death every where in this house
gust of wind from the open window met me
And there was enough moonlight glow so that stood gaping at the silent tragic scene
The two maniac girls were here white bodies scantily clothed hair down
One was sprawled on tlie floor with arms up on the all of the open window
The other was beside her one arm over her com panions hip
Both of them dead
Unmarked by violence
For moment stood transfixed peering down at them so pallid in the moonlight
And saw now their slim bodies revealed by death to be wasted to thinness
Pitiful little creatures
Maniacs only with this strange lusting spell which had been upon them
Pinched thin cheeks under the rouge bodies in life consumed by the fire of their lusts so that now in death they seemed only pallid wraiths of womanhood
And on botii the con torted faces there was frozen grimace as though even in death they were trying wildly to laugh
In that shocked moment saw also curious aspect to these death postures
sort of stretching of the necks gaping stretching mouthsas though the one at the window realizing that death was upon her had staggered here flung up the sash and then fallen and on the floor had again reached upward stretching with her mouth for the air too late to save her
LAUGH AND DIE
Afid the odier weaker had seemed to have been dragging herself My mind flung back
That stench
That perfume
Indefinable It was here now widening my nostrils
The room was permeated with it clinging saturating tins carpet these draperies
For all the wind from tlie opened window smelled it now more strongly than ever before
And with every breath was conscious of Itttle heady thrill to tny senses
Gruesome lethal breaths that smed to hold lure as suck
them in wild pleasure of the senses that could only end in death
gathered my wits
Edith and Anne were not here
searched the room peered along the walls for some loose panel
And tlten brandishing the iron brail futilely for there seemed nothing but the dead remaming in this terrible house fled back to the hall
The right angle turn to the left was here dashed around it
Was that moving sliape off there the distaiKe along the Iiall
went with wild run
No it was nothing but my memory of that shadow had pursued here just before supper
found myself at the head of the back stairs
The Aor at the bottom was partly open now with little moonlight glwing behind it
Cautiously descended
Stopped to listen
Only silence here
At the iKittom shoved the door But it bumped something on the other side something which partly yielded to my shov
The door moved wider with dim scraping on the floor behind it
Like Millie dragging herself Like MiUie
pushed myself through the dooropening
was in small back lower hall with nearby window ad mitting moonlight
Something was here on the floor at my feet had shoved and moved it vdien pushed the door
Like Millie Tlw huddled ody of Emil Gfoff was lying here weltering frwn ghastly crimson slash that almost severed the throat
This charnel house of death
rose erect
think vaguely may liave heard sound behind me but it was engulfed by crash on ray sloiU
Tho world seemed to split with roar and burst of bril liant light so that was conscious only that the faedrail was clattering from my hand as fell
CHAPTER FIVE Orgy of Death VWlTH all my senses faded there was for me nothing but blank abyss of empty soundless darkness
Death itself may be like that
But presently after some nameless interval was aware that was alive
Dimly conscious could feel myseli lying on die floor with rope lashing my wrists beliiod me and wrapped around my ankles
My senses faded again but struggled this time to hold little something whicli was Me
In the blackness there was the sound of panting breath
The fiend was here could feel fingers tying the rope at my ankles
The fabric of garments brushed me
And could hear the breath ing that was the swift triumph of frenzy aboirt to be consummated
Then was being carried Half car ried half dragged with head and shoulders raised and my legs trailing on the floor as this gibbering adversary tugged and panted with my sixfoot bulk
And sight dimly was coming to me
Vague moonlight
This was the narrow back hallway along which was being dragged
door opened
was jerked through tumbled to what seemed the soft ness of rug
Strange smell here
Distinctly perfume now
Exotic aromatic smell like some powerful incense burning here
heard the door slam closed
And at TERROR TALES my appearance there had seaned the dim blurred sound of girls terrified cry
Memory of them snatched my senses to greater alertness
was conscious of throbbing pain at the back of my head my hair wet and matted doubtless with blood
But the horrible weakness was leaving me strength coming back to my limp muscles all my confused senses sharpening clarifying
was in dimly candlelit apartment draped and shrouded
Heavily carpeted soft chairs couches wall rugs and hang ings great splashes of red and black velvet
Macabre interior
Paintings on the walls with the flickering candelight vaguely disclosing their voluptuous nudities
guttural voice at my ear said Oh you are not dead
That hoped grim gibbering chuckle unlioly laugh that had nothing of mirth in it but only horror
Then you sit here and watch
You will enjoy this before you die saw above me the leering malevol ently vile face of Mrs Groff
Gargoyle woman fiend with her bent thick body like gorilla of amazing strength
The prim black taffeta dress was bloodsoaked now
She stood shaking trembling with the frenzy of murderous demoniac triumph
You sit here and watch
Beside him FELT myself being propped up like bent bundle on the floor with cushions behind me
Another figure was here
Ghastly shape sagging here beside me
turned my head to regard it
Rolf For rest
He sagged here propped by cush ions so that he could not fall but slumped with dangling head against his chest
Grisly companion
His face was livid bloodstreaked blood welled from wound in his side great slash which had ripped his shirt half from him ex posing his crimsoned flesh
No he was still breathing faint gasping breaths of unconsciousness
Swift disclosures
No more than half minute had passed since was flung into this Ioom
heard again that girls cry and with senses at last fully clari fied saw across the long apartment in shadows beyond the candlelight broad couch of black and red drapes
Edith and Anne were huddling there
Unharmed save by the extremity of tlieir terror they crouched clinging to each other di sheveled with hair tumbling to their shoulders and their clothing half tom from them
The thick gargoyle shape of Mrs Groff swung away from me and then came back
Maniacal glittering eyes gibbering unholy laughter hideous face so frenzied now that it was contorted beyond sem blance of either woman or man so that it was only monster
You two will watch that will be pleasure indeed for us all
Him did not mean to kill not just yet but he nuide me with his hting She leered down at me and young For rest then like gorilla she swayed away
At the wall where now she stopped for mKnent saw row of huge upright steel cylinders each tall as naan with pressuregage on top
She opened their valves now
In the sudden silence could hear the gas hissing out to mingle with the perfume of the incense which drifted in lazy cloud from brazier on the table
Then she was at the couch where Edith and Anne lay pawing at them with quiv ering hands
Oh you are afraid of me
Little beautiful ones you so slim and dark and you pale like white gold tugged frantically futilely at ray bonds
Beside me the dying Rolf twitched tAUGH DIE
and Anne shcank back before her claw litde as though he too were spurred to frenaied eflort
Edith now was scream ing as the vile Img pawed her
Trou are afraid of met You want me not to toudi youl But is is pleasure little ones
Tlie smgil of pleasure will be with us in moment
You hear it hiss
Cant yoa begin to snidl it now
You fed its caress
You must laugh now and be happy
It ts the smell laughter the intoxieadon of Imaghter the thrill of doing everythmg yrair senses bW you to do and laughing femghk Raging maniac now
And as panted jerking at the ropes that lasted me could fed niy noss diiatiug
That little heady thrill to my senses with every breIr
choked bade grim laugh
Godl Why coaid laugh wliea horror tingled every fiber of me
Then the enoked gorillahags voice rose louder Itenl He laughed
We must all laughl Abruptly the caressing tone turned to rage And stiU you resist me
Yon will not lose your seises to the pleasures tliat are coming
Because am woman Suddeidy the clawlike liands swept up to her head
The primly parted liair was snatidied away to become wig wildly flung across the room
This demoniac fiend not woman
saw his bullet head of closeclipped black hair and iiow with clawing hands he tore away the taffeta waist aiid wliite ruching so that from under it lus muscular hairy chest seemed to burst out freed of its pinching garment
See my beautiful dear ones He stood swaying before the couch gorilla now indeed in every physical aspect
The woman you thought is gone Mrs Groff gone never existing am Ludvig master of pleasure master of laughter TUT the girls were screaming again as he readied to dutdi them Ludvig
My half drugged sens whirled with complete realization
This chamal house of death we the living the only sur vivors now were all gathered here in this room of lust
Eftiil Groffs older brother who masqueraded always as the wife of Dr Emil Groff to give greater semblance of respectability to this supposed sanitorium to give him also greater freedom wtffi the young girl patients who had been admitted here until with the spell of lusting laughter upon them he could dlsdose himself as man
TUe diabolic sted cylinders
Com pressed oxygen
Diltrted in the air as norraahy we Iweathe oxygen is life giving
think ill the case of Annes father nstlung but pure oxygen was used We later found the tubes under his bed leading it from tanks at distant part of the house
He had gone to sleep perhaps with sedative
His window had been ordered closed against the storm and then tlift oxygen had been introduced
Strange device for murder
An oyw stimuLHon of the heart whidi in the old mans case Emil Groff had known would certainly kill Irim quickly
And from the blood and tissues of sudi murdered vic tim the overcharge of pure oxygen quickly wiU evapomte so tiiat no autopsy can discover the cause of death
Unique murder plot
Etnil Groff doubt less had been successful with it many times
But the halfmad Ludvig was not interested
What diabolic other gases he mixed with the oxygen to create in his girl victims the lust that enslaved them has never been disclosed had almost overheard the murder of Emil for unquestionably that quarrel at the foot rf the back stairs had led Ludvig to an impulsive slashing of his younger TERROR TALES brothers throat
For Litdvig then the die was cast
Whatever vestige of rea son he had ever possessed must have been swept into maniacal frenzy then with his brother lying weltering before him so that Ludvig saw only that he must kill every one here
With me perhaps his most feared antagonist still alive and Edith and Anne still with me his twist ed brain must have told him to hide the evidence of the gas so that he crept through the wall panel with which most of these rooms were equipped opened old Mr Forrests window and verified that the old man was dead
And with each ghastly murder Lud vigs frenzy was telling him that he was nearing undisturbed possession of Anne and Edith
The culmination of his unholy lusts now was at hand
The dim candle lit room here had once been storeroom back of the kitchen equipped by Ludvig for the lair of his orgies
And he was laughing now with his triumph so near
You feel it now little white beauties
You breathe its thrill
Intoxicating pleas ure And could feel it now more over whelming with every breath
thriUing exultant pound of my heart
wild sense of power
Desires stirring in me an in toxication of the senses falling away of shackles of restraint which always be fore had been upon me and my animal desires God
Was laughing
Was that Ediths wild laiigh of intoxication ringing out mingled with her halfchoked screams of horror
saw the hideous monstrous form of the half clothed Ludvig reaching across the couch the white intoxicated shuddering girls ITH all the pounding wildness of my newfound strength still the THE damnable rope was holding me
My lunges bumped the Woodsoaked body of Rolf Forrest
He slumped against me
His contorted face twitched not quite dead for the oxygen was bringing last little strength to hold death away mo ment Icmger
And what was this
Rolfs almost va cant eyes imploring me
little twitch at my lashed wrists behind me
His dy ing twitching fingers with little stimu lated strength in tltem plucking at my bonds
His numbing brain with death creeping into it still could direct his twitching fingers Then the death rattle was in his throat shudder swept him twitching and then he slumped and fell forward on his face and lay motionless
jerked and found that my arms were free
fumbled at my ankles tast off the last of the rope and sprang erect
Ludvig did not see me as bounded the twenty feet across the heavy red carpet
He was sprawled
forward on the couch laugii ing pawing
With last bound like pouncing ani mal was on him lifting his hideous vile little body with all the amazing power of my intoxicated strength so that shook him as though he were gigantic rat and whirled and pounded his gargoyle head aginst the nearest of the steel cyl inders
Pounded and laughed with my own wild unholy laughter until his head cracked and cast him dead upon the floor
Anne come With my arms around them we ran slamming the door upon the ghastly room
And up in the house wrapped their shuddering bodies in blankets and we sat through the night waiting for the dawn

evulsion sin tey Austins lithe body as he tated clown at the fig ure of John Eellam in the mountain cot tage hedixiotn
Leltaius thin body tapering slowly from bony legs to narrow shoulders itjiade strangely reptilian shape beneath the It was strange sickness that as sailed John Bellam for his skin had become covered with reptilian scales and every dawn revealed some body crushed as though by huge serpent
bed covers
Hakes of dead cuticle cov ered every visible fndi of his skin rim ming hfs pale lips and surrounding his TERROR TALES closespaced eyes which were bright and ophidian in their fixity
His wrists and hands covered with tlie dry scales and thrusting from his pajama sleeves were like broadheaded serpents nesting in the bed linen
Mary Bellam had told Stanley thather Uncle John Bellam owner of Bellams Greater Circus was recovering from skin disorder but the warning had not prepared the
young lawyer for anything like this
He must have shuddered for Marys warm hands tightened reassur ingly upon his arm
Mary has chosen well The words hissed from Bellams lips
His cold eyes moved slowly from Stanleys polished shoes to the strong breadth of his shoul ders the firm set of his wellslaaped head
Bellajn moved one hand the long scaled fingers coiling palmward and the brown hair prickled along the back of Stanleys necl
wish you both great happiness Thank you Mr Bellam Impulsively Stanleys right hand thrust forward and he took another step toward the bed then horror chilled him as Mary clutched fran tically at his arm
No Her voice was terri fied wail
Dont touch me John Bellam re coiled with the swiftness of serptent
You might Abruptly his thin body relaxed
Sorry to frighten you but were not sure about this His right hand slid across his chest moving with the slow grace of reptile
Bellams Greater Circus specializes in giant py thons and boas
have always loved snakes
Since this happened month ago Ive wondered if handling the big snakes could have He stopped as the door behind Stanley and Mary opened
Stanley turned and gulped as squat misshapen man waddled into the room
The mans big eyes bulging almost level with jutting brows slid over him then flicked to the bed
He was strangely nervous and frightened
You call Misser Bdla His voice was throaty croak
No Bellams tongue darted out to moisten pale lips
Austin this is Shagar
He was my snakeman until maddened python attacked him Bellams glittering eyes seemed to mock the squat figure beside the bed
Shagar hates snakes
Oddly he believes am becom ing giant python Bellams rustling chuckle made Stanleys scalp tighten
believe Shagar hates me for Shagars gnarled fingers clasped nervously
His bulging eyes darted fearfully about the room and Stan ley saw terror in their colorless depths
hate snake
no hate you Misser Enough Bellams hand lifted scaled reptile rearing its broad flat head
Mary you Elbert Weiss and Shagar are circus folks you have cared for me in spite of this
Therefore shall make ar rangements to leave each of you third interest in Bellams Greater Circus
shall be dead within the week Uncle John Stanley felt Marys slim body quiver against him
You shotddnt permit yourself Mr Bellam to he began uncomfortably
shant Bellams bright eyes slitted and Stanley felt chill feeling that was half fear creep through his veins
regret dying human and tamely in bed Bellams glittering eyes seemed to stare through and beyond the three be side the bed
Id prefer the swift death of the jungle the stunning impact of lightning thrust from overhanging branch es the anasthesia of fear
Then coil after coil of steelcabled body Please Nearhysteria sharpened Marys voice
Your pardon Mary Suddenly Bel EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON lams voice was mild and lulling
Where is Elbert Shagar He he go see dog The snakemans twisted body seemed to shrink
Dog Something ketch dog back of cottage Shagar said squirming nervously his bulging eyes wide with terror
It it squeeze dog dead His voice dropped to terrified whisper
It kill like big python Python Breath whistled shrilly from Bellams slitted nostrils
Soulwracking fear froze his thin scaled features and his voice was the voice of damned be ing
Merciful God have already Hello everybody The nasal voice came from behind Stan ley
He swung about and saw wellbuilt man of about thirty standing in the open doorway
The newcomer was tall and muscular and his sleek hair glistened in the afternoon light coming from the open front door at the end of the hall
Oh pardon me His black eyes ap praised Stanley
Didnt know we had company Mr
Weiss this is Stan Stanley Aus tin Mary said and clung tightly to Stan leys arm
Congrats and all that Stan
Youre lucky The pressure of Weiss hand upon Stanleys was quick and strong
Next Thursday so Mary says
Shes prize but Im warning you youre marrying into circus crowd
Of course Im not really one of the family but Certainly you are Elbert said Bel lam as his pale lips bared long fanglike teeth in fond smrle
Youve been with me for years and youll share equally with Mary and Shagar in the Circus after Im gone
We Thanks Mr Bellam
But lets not talk about your going Weiss stepped to the bed clasping longfingered hands behind his back
His black eyes darted to Shagars twisted figure
Shagar told you about the dog eh Elbert
Is it true
Was the animal really Bellam had risen to sitting position and his closespaced eyes were filled with stark terror
It was Weiss eyes lifted from Bel lams scaled body and Stanley saw his lips tighten
The dog was crushed ap parently by huge snake but that of course is impossible
boa anaconda or python couldnt live in this mouittain climate
It He snapped long fingers
almost forgot
Were going to have more company
saw Herman Kelleys big red car coming up the road
Hes probably after Bellams Circus again
Con solidating Kelleys and Bellams would make the biggest combination in If that scoundrel Bellams slitted eyes were flaming with hate
Anybody home The big voice boomed through the cottage
The screen door banged and heavy feet stamped toward the bedroom
Hi Elbert
You get puttier and puttier Mary
Hi John Stanley didnt have to be told that the heavyjowled giant barging into the bed room was Herman Kelley owner of Kel leys Shows
Heard you was sick John so come to see you Kelleys big feet slapped the floor toward the bed
His little piggish eyes swept Stanley from head to foot
Mary introduced them
Glad to know any guy Mary knows Kelley grinned and turned to the bed
Now John Herman Kelley The words spat from Bellams lips
He drew away from the rival show owner like snake settling to strike
If youve come up here to Easy John said Kelley spreading beefy hand
My shows playing Maxton four miles over the hills
heard you was sick so come over to Abruptly Kel leys heavy jaw dropped and he backed TERROR TALES away from the bed
Holy cats John
Yon got acales like snake Uncle John has malignant eczema Mary spce kidnaafly as she left Stan ley Md moved toward the bed her curly bkmd head high
He is no condition to discuM Okay
It it just gimme turn seeing them scales Kdley mopped at his beefy face with puredged handkenchief
been catching hell with snakes latdy
Bought some boas and pythons from busted show and the damn worms been driving me nats
The biggest python got away in Maxton Got away Mary screamed in way that made Stanleys teeth dick together
Then the dog was You youre bunting for the snake The wwds pushed from Stanleys tight throat
The crushed dog perhaps crushed liuman nex His eyes sought Marys trim blond figure and shudder rippled through his body
Hunting it heWf Kelley snorted
should delay the show and waste thou sand bucks for fiftydollar worm
The damn thing cant live in these mountaoie
It brfongs to the guy who finds it Then grin split Kelleys red face yet his keen little eyes watched Bellanis every move
How bout five grand over my last offer for Bellams Cireus
Youre laid up and there aint no telling how Get outJ Bellams sharp hiss drove the larger man back
Kelley barged to the door then stopped turned and leveled diick finger
You might jests well sell me the show John he boomed pigKke eyes narrowed
Iil get it sooner or later Ilieu Kelley was gone his heavy feet pounding out of the cottage
tfiTpHERES the dpg Elbert Weiss slightly ahead of Stanley Austin and Shagar pointed through the thin growth of pines and un derbrush in the narrow alley behind the mountain cottage
Two strides of Stan leys long legs brought him beside Elbert
Shagar waddled at the lawyers heels
Directly before the three men shape less bundle of brownishgray fur huddled upon the needlecarpeted ground Bright afternoon sun sifted through the trees and splashed the ghastly object with shafts of lht
Elbert moved toward the thing
Stan ley follow
He could hear Shagar waddling behind him
ITte twisted snakeman was mutter ing viciously beneath his breath
They reached the crushed carcass and strange mingfing of nausea and fear gripped Stan ley Austin
Tlie animal had been welldeveloped German poEce dog
Now it was but horribly shapeless mass blooddotted fiir
throaty croak made Stanleys scalp tighten before he realized the sound was coming frexn Shagar
The crippled snake man was staring down at the crushed dog his bulging eyes glazed with horror
Python do that shudder twitched Shagars squat misshapen body
Most do me like that
Misser Bella watch
Laugh like he glad hurt
He been punch snake make him mad
He hate me Shagars croaking voice went shrill
He like to kill me
Misser Bella talk to snake tell him to squeeze me
Snake talk to him hiss
Misser Bella always halfsndce
He be all snake quick
He ketch me do me like that
He squeeze me squeeze more people like Nonsense Shagar Elbert Weiss laugh was strained
He wetted his lips nervously Forget the crazy stuff He seemed fordbly tq tear his black eyes from the dogs crushed body
Weve got to get that python
You take the other side of the vaHey
You know what to do
Stanley youd better go to the little clear EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON ing about quarter mile down the valley
If the python comes near you sing out
Shagar and Ill be witli you in two min utes
Im going up the valley and work back
We ought to have few more men but Well lets go Elbert stalked off through the trees heading toward the left
Still muttering Shagar waddled past the dogs carcass and headed across the valley
Stanley could hear him slipping on the pine needles after his twisted fig ure had disappeared behind the trees
The young lawyer started down the valley his muscular fingers tight about the short club he had picked up near the cottage
Elbert had said the python would be unlikely to measure over eighteen feet and it would undoubtedly be sluggish halfdormant
Yet tight smile touched Stanleys firm lips as he moved forward cautiously brown eyes probing the trees and brush about him
The pines thinned and disappeared after he had walked few moments
Stanley was coming into small irregular clear ing rimmed with the scrubby trees and underbrush
Afternoon sunlight made the place look almost cheery yet strange thoughts thrust into Stanleys mind
Was John Bellam actually being trans formed into reptile
Were those ghastly scales upon his skin but forerunner of the horror to come
Had Bellam as Sha gar charged deliberately prodded the py thon into attacking the snakeman
Could the strangely reptilian circus owner actu ally talk with snakes speak their hissing language
Had the police dc been at tacked by tlie python that liad escaped from Kelleys Shows or had it been crushed by John Bellam whose thin scaled body was snakelike in its derisive laugh burst from Stanlys lips
He was letting the queer happenings break his nerve
The whole thing was sane enough just skin disease crip pled and halfmad snakeman and an es caped python
Yet Underbrush rustled nearby and every muscle in his bbdy snapped taut
His fin gers went white about the short club
Bleak with sudden almost numbing fear his brown eyes probed between the surrounding trees
slight movement caught his eyes then small bird darted up from the ground
The lawyer relaxed and grunted as he realized that the mus cles of fais jaws ached
Resolutely he started to whistle but he stopped as he recalled reading somewhere that reptiles were peculiarly steceptible to shrill noises
Damn circuses and snakes
After he and Mary were married Sudden horror held Stanley motion less and the abrupt poimding of his heart all but drowned the shrill scream ringing in the narrow wooded valley
It was the terrified scream of man in the maddening throes of infinite agony
It came again
Stanley stood rigid
The cry was com ing from the rt side of the valley
It knifed his eardrums again dien stopped choking short with gurgling moan
For moment the valley was gripped in awful silence
Then Stanley heard heavy body breaking through the brush to his left
Weiss His voice sounded queer shrill in his ears
He broke into stumbling run toward the sound his fingers glued to the short club in his right hand
Swaying tree branches plucked at his clothing
Underbrush whipped at his legs
Yet he stumbled on the horrible cry still echoing in his brain
After few moments he stopped every faculty concentrated on listening
The noise of breakii brush had ceased and there was no sound but the throb of blood in his ears the eerie whisper of wind in TERROR TALES the trees about him
He moved forward cautiously his aching eyes probing the brush
shapeless mass upon the ground some distance ahead drew his gaze like mag net
Cold horror swelled in his brain waves of ausea swept over him and the dread certainty that the shape was human grew in his mind
Gritting hie teeth to steady jerking nerves he forced himself toward the ghastly shape
It was man man whose body was crusted into mocking travesty of human form
There were no definable outlines to the horribly shapeless mass
It was but ghastly huddle of crushed flesh bone and btoodsoaked clothing
Controlling himself with an effort Staidey forced himself to examine the thing
It was Shagar the crippled snake man
Shads features were bloated
His colorless eyes had burst from their sockets horrible globes pendant from red veins and muscles
Trickles of blood streaked his cheeks
His mouth was fixed in grimace of agony
The side of his head was bruised
His body was bloodseep ing pulp
John Bellaras mad words flashed into Stanleys diilled mind as he stared down at the crushed snakeman
The stunning impact of lightning thrust from overhanging branches the anesthesia of fear
Then coil after coil of steelcabled body Stanley spun his right fist white about the short dub ald prickles racing along his spine
OOIETHING had moved in the trees behind him
He heard it again then saw the figure of man coming through the underbrush
Stanly Shagar cried Elbert Weiss
He broke from the trees and ran toward Stanley his face deathly pale
My God Stanleyl Im glad youre unhurt
heard He saw Shagars crushed body behind the young lawyer and his black eyes went wide filled with horror
It it got Shagar
was afraid it was you
He raked sweat from his forehead with shaking fingers
He stopped froze into an attitude of listening then Stanley heard some one lowing through tlie brush toward them
Hil ElbertI Shagar shouted Her man Kelleys big voice
In moment the heavyjowli showman came into sight his body crashing toward them
Heard goshawful screech aud thought mebbe Id better see whats what
You got any idi what Then Kelley saw Shagars pulped body
Holy God
His voice was but hoarse croak
The pytlion Your python
Elbert Weiss voice was brittle
My python hell
give the snake to John
Kelley whipped about with sur prising swiftness and gripped Stanley Austins arm
You vas witness Aus tin
You got to say give the snake to John
aint responsible for this His bulging eyes fought clear of Shagars crushed figure Howd you happen to come up here Swift tljoughts clicked in Stanleys mind
You cant pull me in on this
roared Kelley big hands clenching
left the cottage stopped at the store and talked bit Miss Mary come in and left started across the valley in my car
Then heard the screech and come up and You saw Mary Bellam at the store
The words exploded from Stanleys lips
She musta come down after something
It aint but halfmile from the cottage to Kelley stalled bulging eyes following Stanley as the young law yer whipped past him moving with swift groundeatihg stride
What Where you EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON To tlie cottage Stanley flung the words over his shoulder
John Bellams up there alone and Marys out where that python can attack her He increased his pace to run heard Kelley and Weiss pounding after him
Reaching the cottage Stanley crossed the front porch legs stiff cold horror gnawing at his heart
The place was quiet with queerly sinister silence
Kelley and Weiss burst from the trees about the cot tage and trotted toward the porch
Mr Bellam The silent empty cottage seemed to engulf Stanleys call
There was no an swering sound
He pushed through the open doorway striding toward the door to the Bellams room
He heard Weiss and Kelley on the front porch
Bellams room door was open and Stan ley saw the bed at the first glance
It was empty the covers thrown back
There was no sign of Bellams thin scaled fig ure
Mad thoughts churned in Stanleys mind
We got to get together on this thing Elbert Kelleys bull voice drifted in from the porch Weiss nasal tones an swered
Its now case of getting Weiss stopped then his voice was shrill and high
Theres Mary now coming up tlie Stanley reached the front door as the car neared the cottage
Kelley and Weiss were running toward the road
Mary Bel lam seemed lost behind the wheel of the big sedan
Her blue eyes went big and frightened as she braked the car to stop
Weiss and Kelley crowded to the opened left window
Stanley strode across the porch ran toward the car
Why did you leave Mr Bellam El bert Weiss was reaching for the door handle
Stanley caught his arm and pulled him away
You heard me give the damn snake to John Mary Kelleys big head was thrust through the opened window
You got to witness Stanleys muscular hand upon his shoulder stopped him
The yotmg lawyer pulled Kelley away from the car
Take it easy you two Stan
Something terrible has hap pened Marys slim hands were warm on Stanleys wrist
Uncle John sent me to the store for cigars
Something has hap pened to him
Tell me Stan She pushed the car door open and stepped to the road frightened eyes seek ing the cottage door
Bellams gone blurted EIbt Weiss long fingers clasping nervously
The py thon killed Shagar Oh Mary swayed against Stanley
dry sob choked in her throat
Weiss said Stanley as his arm tight ened about Marys quivering shoulders suppose you take the car and notify the Sheriff and coroner Coroner hell bellowed Kelley
We dont want law in this yet
Well find Bellam and the python then holler cop
ril get gang of showhands Before either Stanley or Weiss could stop him Kelley was in the Bellam sedan and had it swinging about heading down the valley in cloud of dust
Why the dirty Burning anger flamed in Elbert Weiss black eyes as he stared at the speeding car
deep frown creased Austins broad forehead and his lips tightened grimly as he watched the sedan disappear around turn
Herman Kelley was after Bellams Greater Circus
He had been in the valley when Shagar screamed
Could the beefy showman have planned to murder all but one of Bellams heirs before killing Bel lam himself then buy the show from the survivor
Kelley didnt want the police yet
Could that mean he was using his TERROR TALES supposed trip to Maxton or showhands as atover for another murder
Was John Bellam alive or had Kelley watched the cottage waited untU Bdlam was alone then Elbert
Austin TTie faint cry was coming from the narrow valley behind the mountain cot tage the eerie tones seemed to pluck with chill fingers at Stanleys nerves
It its Uncle John Mary Bellams clutching fingers dug into Stanleys arm
Elbert Weiss was already running toward the sound
Stanley started after him Mary dragging at his arm and as they sped toward the narrow wooded val ley behind die cottage dread certainty grew in Starfeys mind
Each one of these strange happenings was but part of mad plan
Each incident was leading to hideous deathfilled climax
Bellam He heard Elbert Weiss running through the brush ahead
Mary was stumbling panting at hife side
Elbert John Bellams shrill cry came from ditiy to the left
Stanley clianged his course foUowii Elbert Weiss helping Mary through the entangling underbrush
Then they saw the tliin pajamaclad figure of John Bellam ahead through the trees and Stanley thought of horrible halfreptile creature wandering in the wooded valley
THEY reached the circus owner and again revulsion swept over Stanley Austin as he looked at the dry scalelike flakes of dead cuticle on Bellams skin
queer tightening came into the young law yers body
Something has happened to Shagar Bellanis narrow head thrust forward as he hissed the words the head of scaled reptile upon thin upright body
heard him scream
It was like his scream when he was attacked by tlie python Bdkm pawed at his narrow forehead and the dry rasp of scales sent prickles of horror through Stanleys tight scalp
Cir cus dks feel death Bellams ophidian eyes were unnaturally bright and uiiwink iug
knovif Shagar is dead His thin body swayed queer sinuous movement
Take me to his body Stanley Austin felt the hair rising upon his head
Bellam had sent Mary away from the cottage
He had been alone
He hated Shagar had according to the crippled snakeman prodded python into attack ing him before
BcIImi could have slipped from the cottage crossed the valley and Stanley shuddered
Shagar liad said Bellam was halfsnake could talk the hiss ing language of serpents
Shagar had pre dicted his own death in the crushing coils of snake
He had said that Bellam would be that serpent
Had the crippled snakeman possessed some horrible secret knowledge about John Bellam
Had he been crushed because of that knowledge
Take me to Shagar John Bellams tlim figure weaved in loathswne serpentine movement
His sharp tongue licked pale lips avidly
queer hungry gleam burned in his un winking eyes
His cold fixed stare fas tened upon Elbert Weiss
Take me to Shagar Elbert he com manded hissingly
Weiss lifted muscular shoulders in an expressive shrug turned and started off through the trees heading for the spot where Stanley had found the crippled snakemans horribly crushed body
Muscles hard with strange tautness Stanley followed
Mary walked at his side her trembling hands clutching his arm
The sinking sun painted darkening shadows in the narrow vaHey
slight evening breeze had started and faint EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON eerie whispers drifted through the trees Stanley stopped warned by something he could not define
Quickening blood pumped in his ears
His lips felt parched and dry
His right hand clenched then he remembered he had dropped his short club near the cottage
Beside him Mary Bellam stood stiffly her frightened breath shrill in his ears
He could feel her slim figure trembling against him
His bleak eyes probed the trees ahead
Then the something which had warned him became apparent
Elbert Weiss and John Bel lamys thin pajamaclad figure were no where in sight
No sound came from the trees and brush ahead
Slowly Stanley moved forward fingers knotted into hard fists
Mary walked at his side held silent by his tenseness
As they passed low mass of brush Stanley heard furtive rustle behind him
Chilled breath stopped in his throat
The skin of his back crawled with sud den numbing horror and John Bellams strange words flashed into his mind
The stunning impact of lightning thrust from overhanging branches the anesthesia of fear
Then coil after coil of steelcabled body Instinctively he pushed Mary away from him and svmng about his fists knot ted
Halfway around he was aware of vague something lashing out from the brush
smashing weight crashed into the side of his head
Lights flamed within his skull
Marys terrified scream reached his ears seem ing to come from an incredible distance
sable pall tightened about him
Something hard and round encircled his body yet he couldnt move couldnt scream the terror swelling in his lungs
Merciful unconsciousness engulfed him
CTANLEY AUSTIN became aware of strange acrid smell nervetighten ing odor that had rank corrosive qual ity about it
It was somehow unutterably slimy and unclean
Then abruptiy he knew what it was the nauseous stench of reptiles
His eyes snapped open and startled cry ruslied to his lips and stopped
He was gagged bound hand and foot and lying upon the rough stone floor of large cave
To his right he could see Mary Bellams slim figure
The girl was also bound and gag bit into the soft flesh of her cheeks
She was unconscious her eyes closed
Still dazed by the blow upon his head Stanley looked about him
Farther toward the back of the cavern was queer structure of heavy beams and coils of heavy hawserlike rope
He saw powerful hydraulic jack
The shadowy figure of man was crouched behind the crude machine
Stanleys eyes swept past the man drawn irresistibly toward the back of the cave then the noisome gag between his teeth flung back the scream of horror that tried to burst from his tight lungs
The dusky shadows at the back of the cavern held the coiled bulk of giant python
He could see the sinuous coils of its huge scaled body the blynt triangle of its head
Its eyes made tiny points of light in the shadows
It seemed dormant
Yet there was certain pulsing of life about the giant bulk
Stanleys eyes swung back to the crouched shape of the man the crude ma chine and the hideous solution of the whole mad scheme burst like blinding flame within his brain
He knew now the purpose of the ropes and beams knew the identity of the kneeling man
ghastly vision of Shagars crushed body swam before his eyes
He knew now why he and Mary had been brought to this cavern
Frantically he tried to burst free of the TERROR TALES ropes about his wrists
Warm blood crawled upon his skin as the rough hemp bit into his flesh
He saw now that mans head thrust above the coils of hawserHke rope be tween the heavy beams
The features were all but obscured by the thick folds of gag yet Stanley knew who it was John Bellam
Stanley threw every ounce of his strength into straining against the ropes but they held fast
groan of despair forced from his tiglit lips
Warned by the sound the figure crouched beltmd the machine straightened turned
Stanley knew his identic before he rose
It was Elbert Weiss
Marys brave lover is awake hacking laugh rasped from Weis leering mouth
KeUey id his showlds find plenty whai they come back Weiss bent released the big hydraulic jack and the thick ropes about Bellams thin figure loosened
He pulled the sliape less mass that had been Bellams body from the madiine flung it over his shoul der and stalked toward the front of the cave
Tteyll find Bellam and you crashed by the python and theyll find Marys body in the coils of my prize beauty He jerked his head tovrard the rear of the cave
will own Bellams Circus
In few months Kelley and will consolidate the Greatest and Big gest Siiow Earth and Ill own half of it Chuckling throatily Weiss strode out of the cave carrying Bellams crushed figure
Stanley tore at the ropes about his wrists rising sense of defeat beating at his mind
Bellam was already dead crushed in the liydraulic maeWne
He and Mary would be next
Grinding his teeth into the wadded cloth in his moutti Stan ley tried to push the gag free tried to shout
Then he heard Weiss returning
Its my turn now
Miss Bellam Weiss stalked to Marys bound figure and stared down at her black eyes flam ing with mad hate
Marys eyes snapped open filled with terror as she saw him
Youve looked on me as bum and common circus Imnd ever since Ive been wth Bellams Youve always avoided me but you cant now Weiss voice dripped venom
Within ten minutes youll be dead and Ill own Bellams Show
Shagar was easy
He died without struggle in my machine but Im saving the live snake for you
Miss Bellam
Ill watch and laugh as It crushes you
Your lover can watch too but he wont laugh
Hell be fighting the ropes in my mechanical py thon After you two are dead Ill put you and the python in the vaJley for Kel ley and his men to find
Ill be at the other end of the valley hunting for you Picking the girl from the floor Weiss carried her to the back of the cavern dropped her upon the coiled python and stepped back mad snarling laugh bub Wing from his lips
The huge serpents angry hiss filled the cave and Stanleys eyes widened with hor ror as he saw the deadly mottled body sliding about Mary enfolding her in its ghastly embrace
The young lawyer exploded in mad effort to burst the ropes about his hands dropped back aS his tortured muscles re belled under the strain
The pjthon had looped two coils about Marys slim fig ure one about her waist the other abotrt the fresh plumpness of her breasts
The girl was paralyzed with terror the anes thesia of fear
Stanley tried to jerk erect and sharp projection of rock beneath him gouged into his pressing hands cutting the flesh
Abruptly he stiffened and new hope flashed into his mind
Feverishly he EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON latruned his bound wrists on the sliarp rock and sob caught in his throat as the benrp snagged on the projection
In less than raimite several strands of the rope had parted
Weiss was standing near the pjrthon unholy ndcrest glraming in hfe black eyes as he watched the snake cotlitig about the girl
The serpents mottled body wtis waving slowly about Mary
One coif had trapped her anWes another cMitracterf aboul tier thighs
Even as Stanfey stared tlie rthoR looped anodier ceil about the girls shoulders and he could see steel cahled mtsdes crawling breath the rep tifs mettled skin as it tightened about ks terrified ptey
Cbogesled biood darkened Stanlys face as he put every atom of hh strength into the effort of freeing his hands
HoT roopeot breath ewdled hia
lungs Dimn by sheer despair he atramed at the ropes
Flesh and bone threatened to give under the strain iien sdirupdy something mapped
He idt the weakened heo dadien about tns wrists
Madly he clawed free of the bomk lurched to his ieeL Wss span and irurlcd his tall figure at Stanley as the latter stinnbfed towd Mary Bellani
The young lawyer met his rush with flying right fist that barbed squarely on Weiss mouth
The mad killer swung his feet in vicious kick that raised skin from Stanles shins
Stanleys right fist stabbed at Weiss face again connected and sharp grinding pain shot up to the lawyers right sfiouTder as he felt hot blood gush over his knurides
Weiss shot toward tlie ba of the cave as thouglt catapulted his muscular body squirming as he tried to keep his balance
He smashed into the rock wall and dropped to the floor still squirming
Stenley lunged for the hissing python Weiss statement ckmoring in his brain
man could handle tlie big snake
Ks stiff fingers toudied the reptile and the scafy feel of its body sent waves of horror through his Ihfte figure
Tearing frantically at the engulfing coils he freed Marys holders stabbed at the reptiles weaving bead witli bloody hands
Slug giridy it tried to trap him in its mottled coils
He fougJt free tore the slimy body from about Mary as eer terror and horror gave added stretth to his mosdes
The girl was unconscious
Stardey putted her free caugbt lier lia figure in bis suuis and stumbled toward the mouth of the cave die angry hiss of the sfoggkh python eehoit in his ears
qoidc gianced showed him Elbert Weiss ndling over trying to get to his feet but Stanley strode on Mary Bellam mhtsarms
The sound of underbrush bfeaWog in the woods nearby stopped him at the cave mouth and in second he saw Herman Kelleys big bulk plowing through the bushes toward the cave
Six thickshoul cfered Ipirities buret from the woods be hind the big showowner
All them carried ropes and eltdis
Hi Stan
broo tiw boys
Well find that slrriil maddening scream burst from the cave oiouth the scream of num faced by uneakabe horror and Stan ley thout of Eert Weiss almost help less
The young lawyer shuddered
What the Kelley stared at Marys bound figure hfs piglike es wide
Get your men in the cave Kelley Stanley worked at the gag and ropes about Mary Bellams white flesli
Try to save both of the snakes in there
Come up to the cottage after you are througli
Ill wtplain the whole thing to the coroner ami the police BRIDE FOR DEATH curse older than Confu cius threatened the lovely body of Liu Mei curse Gordon Uais laughed at until she disappeared mysteriously from his very arms only to reappear after he was doomed and helpless in chamber of dread surrounded by lustmad coolies whose master de manded of her sacrifice that could be conceived by no brain not spawned in hell
DANK fog rdJed over New we heard the dismsd wailing of distant Yorks Chinatown from the rivers foghorns the very soul it seemed of and the Sound
Now and again Chinatown itself
Chinese music came By ARTHUR BURKS Cuthor of Coil Af etuter etc
tlirough too from many hidden places and it was to me cry from the heart of China
waited there in the sitting room of Liu Ti for him to tell me why he had asked me to come
Id have come to him around the world and he knew it
For forty years my father had been his friend and his fathers friend in China
Liu Ti and my father had been bloodbrothers had mingled their blood from cuts in their strong right forearmsv too knew China
had spent all of my boyhood and most of my young man Weirdly Moving Novelette Chftrged With the Ominous Mystery of the East TERROR TALES hood there and had learned to love it
It is dangerous thing am asking you to do Gordon Bais said Liu Ti
didnt answer
looked at his niece gorgeous Liu Mei and knew that it had to do with her
Did she know my secret this Liu Mei
Did Kwan Tao know it
Kwan Tao the dusky stalwart young Chinese who stood beside her
doubted it
had never told it to soul though Liu Mei must have read it in my eyes
We had been children together had almost grown up together
Her father had mar ried one of Liu Tis sisters and her fath er had been an American
In the eyes of her world and mine she was an Eurasian neither Chinese nor foreign
looked at her and thought of how cruel people could be to one another
In the veins of my niece said Liu Ti almost in whisper runs the proud blood of kings She was the most gorgeous woman have ever seen
Her hair and eyes were black and she bad the delicate beauty which must have been that of Kwan Yin God dess of Mercy when she had been mortal walking the earth
am ready to do anything old friend said to Liu Ti
There has always been bond between us and between thee and Liu Mei
You played together as children
Now Gordon Bais take her away and cherish her gasped in amazement
think my sur prise must have made me look ridiculous
But Kwan Tao to whom you have promised her It can not come to pass just now
Gordon shadow of which can give you but the slightest hint hangs over the houses of Liu and Kwan
It means death It whispers in the wind across the win dows
It sighs in the fog
It moans in the sounds from the river
Take her away with you quickly
For you an American it may be possible looked at Liu Mei
Just to meet her eyes had countless times caused my heart almost to stop beating
She didnt smile
Her lips were white and terror was in her face as it was in the eyes of Liu Ti and Kwan Tao
There were beads of sweat on the fore head of Liu Ti and he was of the old school one of those whose faces did not cliange even under torture If asked you Gordon said Liu Mei herself
Anything Runt said you know that Fd called her Runt when we had been brats together in Canton
But what of Kwan Tao looked at her fiance trying to figure it out Liu Ti spoke again
It is better you did not know
Liu Mei knows little which she may tell you when she is safely away with one who loves her
Later perhaps Kwan Tao The weirdness of Chinatown of China transplanted chilled me
Again was conscious of the dismal foghorns of the creepy mist that swathed the windows of the strange music from the heart of China town
Nobody will bother foreigner be hind whom is the threat of the foreign police said Liu Ti
You will go forth unmolested
It will be thought that be cause all of the blood in her veins is not Chinese have ast her out to become member of her fathers people could see the scheme then and it seemed mad yet perhaps the only one that might work
And knew something of the frightful fury of nameless shad ows in Chinatown
shall guard her until have word from you as though she were my sister which almost she is It was knowing this that made me send for you
have never asked before BRIDE FOR DEATH Liu Mel tali for Chinese girl dressed in Occidental garb came to me then smil ing little and gave me her hand
How soft it wasl It made me think of beat ing heart birds heart perhaps beating in the palm of the birds captor
And after Liu Mei came Kwan Tao with firm handshake whidi said more than any words he could have irttered
HE beating of my own heart almost suffocated me as stepped into the Iiallway with Liu Mei
And there was sorrow too that was deeper than the wells of Shallaja
would have given my life for girl
could understand the grt love defying all prejudice all conventions which must have bound this girls father to her mother
And now both were dead and Liu Mei dwelt in the house of her unclC aiid bore his name
She put her liand on my arm as we walked to tlte electric elevator Liu Tis establislnnent combination office and resi dence was of five stories and the stairs were almost never used for travel between floors
It suffocated me almost to stand in the tiny elevator with Liu Mei
Surely she must Imow and lier eyes told me that she did that she knew she might never men tion it
would never dare
And because would never dare blurted out Tve always loved you Liu Mei
My greatest desire is for your happiness She was very close to me then and her hand was still on my arm
Her per fume was in my nostrils like the radiant ghost of herself that might go with me always
Her eyes told me that she had always known
Was it fancy or did see deep down in their depths some hint of love returned
shook my head in the shock of the near revelation to drive away the image of tlie happiness that might have been ours were it not for the insurmount aWe barriers of blood
Tliere will never be another Liu Mei said
pressed the button for the first floor and the cage started down
Liu Mei as we passed tlie fourth floor reached out her hand and turned off the light in the cage
was alone in the dark with the woman of all women whom loved and for moment as the age went creaking down the knowledge hdd me paralyzed
had looked at my watch from force of habit when we had entered the cage
Ten minutes after eleven at night
By eleventhir would have taken Liu Mei to safety
Then must bear my own strange cross in patience until she was taken from me foKver
Her hand had dropped from my arm as though she were afraid of what might do in my madness and locked my lips tightly on whatever else desperation might have made me say
The first floor was just below us
snapped on the light again mustered smile and turned to lead her forth when the cage stopped
couldnt believe my eyes
The cage hadnt stopped moving would have sworn totliat but Lfu Md was not with me
She had vanished out of moving elevator as though she had turned to fog and eddied out through the grills into the shaft
Nor was that all
Five stalwart men in hideous devil masks had taken her place
stared at them in amazement
It couldnt be yet it was
Somewhere along the route from the fifth floor to the first Liu Mei had vanished and the five had taken her place
And the cage hadnt stopped moving
It had been magic
Where is she demanded in shrill frightened Cantonese
Gone said one
And it is an order that the meddling foreigner be punished so that never again will he be tempted to meddle TERROR TALES The speaker pressed the button again and the cage started to ascend
They stopped it between the third and fourth floors
As we went up snapped glance at my watch
It said eleventhirty
The cage bearing Liu Mei and myself had been twenty minutes descending
The speaker turned out the light
must have been paralyzed with fear and sur prise for didnt even offer resistance
In the dark the hands of the devils began upon me
Their feet came into use too
They kicked me
They clawed me
They battered away at me
They ripped clothing from me with their knives
Finally when it seemed could stand the agony no longer something heavy struck the top of my head
The cage was filled with shooting stars as the bot tom seemed to fall out of it dropping me headlong into the shaft where struck to find oblivion black as the deepest night
When regained consciousness was sprawled outside the elevator on the ground floor
The outer door of course was closed
Fog seeped through under it to be absorbed by the lights
was alone in building filled with echoes and hor ror
My hellish assailants were gone
staggered to my feet
My head was splitting
ached in every bone and mus cle
vras sixfooter who should have been able to put up terrific battle but the five had handled me with ease giving me the most brutal beating any man had ever had to take
The seeming miracle of the twenty minute descent the vanishing of Liu Mei the appearance of the five did not puzzle me as it might have any one who did not know the potentialities of Chinese master mummers as did
didnt leave though as the five or those who had sent them must have ex pected
They did not know my feeling for Liu Mei which would have sent me Into the pit itself
rang for ffie elevator again
crawled into it wondering what sort of hell would breathe its brimstone into it this time and went back to the fifth floor
The door to the apartment of Liu Ti was open
crossed the threshold my terror mounting
There was nobody here but Liu Ti and what might have said to him would never now be said
He was dead
He hung by silken cord from beam of his living room
His face was mask of horror
His bulging eyes stared right at me as though he said By the bond which existed between yovr father and me Gordon Bais com mand you to stand by my niece and her betrothed until the end
CHAPTER TWO Tiny Shoes ERY carefully and reverently cut the cord which hung Liu Ti to the beam and lowered him to the floor
had closed the outer door
Then now went systematically through all the rooms
Not another soul was in the place living or dead
Yet he had had sister here wife and brother
Now all were gone
And by virtuef being my fathers son was part of this family
had been spared knew because was not Chi nese
But if did not refrain from med dling my recent captors had said and had provtti by their manhandling my white blood would not save me from their sinister designs
Right now could have sworn scores of eyes were watching me studying me waiting The family of Liu Ti was gone
He at least would never know if went out this very minute into the street and left Chinatown never to return
What had to do with the Chinese
Maybe in the final analysis loved that part of Liu BRIDE FOR DEATH Mei which was of my own race
Maybe was blinded by my love of Oiina where had spent so many years
Maybe wlien my own pecle looked upon love between the races with revclsion they were rht
Maybe Well if went away now was safe
They had safd so
If sted the beating had taken would be horribly littfe compared to what could do to me
But Lla Meis father had been white and ray own fathers friend knew what my dad if he had been Iivlog would have done
And knew what my own heart dictated
stooped over Liu Ti then aad whirred They wont get away with it oM titnw said
Not while Im Hp couldnt hear me of course or could he
His face didnt diaie ex preon but somehow knew th he knewhhad perhaps known from the be gimiang
belb the love between Mei and me xvas the sort of thft whidi ndgbl de vefbp between boy and girt vdio rear ttether had never been allowed to know what the outside wortd thiJut of what it cruelly cafied mfcced love
It was just that nothing more
To me she was Chinese and the sooner forgot about her the better
But even as these traitorous thoughts went through my brain like black Utning flashes seemed to see Liu Mei standing befons me her eyes calm filled with the bnowkdge of the ages as th stared into mine and said Tt isnt like you Gordon
And it wasnt
Why should human be ings draw back from one another be cause of race or color or relon
knew then that nothing wouW ever change me not even when the time came as it pBobably would when would be put to torture for my meddling
Without backward glance hurried from the room of Liu Ti and into the hallway had last traversed with Liu Mei
Somewhere between the fourth ftooi and the first told myself the strange thing happened must find which floor ril start with the fourth
For it was there that Liu Mei afraid of being spied upon had turned out the ligjit
went down in the devator
It pleased me to defy the enemy tn thfs much at least
stiped at the fourth floor and got out shutting the door behind me
was in another hallway brilliantly Itghted
began to move along it my eyes study ing every inch of space
had the feeling that somehow Liu Mei woidd drop some thing dial would let me know that would point the way to the place might find her
But there was notHng
went back to the elevator
hadnt seen soul and the echoes of my own footfalls had taken on sinister meaning in the deserted hallway
They seemed to be shouting to me to go bsrck to run fo cease trying to pry into the dark secrets of Chinatown
started to open the elevator door but it would not open
My heart stopped for moment
Since had left the cage some one had signaled for it and it had nedown or up
Viciously jabbed the button and lieard the whirring of the cage from below
There was something horrible in that whirring
What would see when opened the door of the cage
Who had signaled it
Had that one known what was doing
es watched me now loiew it
They would watch me as long as was in Qimatown and wher ever went out of Qiinatown until the tortuous Chinese minds were satisfied that the affair of Liu Ti and Kwan Tao and Liu Mei had been settled accordhig to the rdenttess Chinese code
The cage stopped at my floor
yanked open the door
dont know what ex pected to find certainly not what did TERROR TALES find Liu San brother of Liu Ti standing in corner of the cage rigidly erect his black eyes staring into mine
There was the haft of knife sticking out of his left breast
His right hand was clutched about the haft
Cold chills raced along my spine
He was dead
He had to be dead with the knife in him like that
But why did he stand upright
And why was he in the cage now when it had been empty the last time had seen it
Or had it
The last three words were almost cry of terror
Had he been there with me during my recent descent from the fifth floor to the fourth
If he had hadnt known it ret knew it was possible
would have screamed but knew it use less
hundred murders could have been committed here and none outside the wiser as long as the victims were Chi nese
white man disappearing would be sought
stepped into the cage which quivered little and touched the body of Liu San
Instantly it toppled sidewise crashing stiffly to the floor
The corpse was already rigid
Had this body been sent to me as warning
didnt know but did know that some one listened many some ones and watched
shouted knowing that my words went ringing up and down the shaft and out through the grills at all five floors So help me God Ill bring every one responsible for this to justice and Ill slay them with my bare hands if any harm comes to Liu Mei Of course it was foolish
No sooner had shouted the echoes ringing all through the empty building than knew just how foolish it was
On the hallway of the floor above me could hear the scuffling of sandaled feet
On the floor below could hear it too
All through the building
slammed the door dropped down to the next floor
And this time left the door open so that only by cwning to this floor could any one use the elevator
And Id be in the hallway where could see whoever approached
was fighting mad and more frightened than had ever been for Liu Mei mostly told myself and didnt fool myself at all
remembered the kiss and caress of Chinese knives and knew that would feel them again
Liu Mei perhaps was feeling them now searched this hallway too and found nothing
Then went back to the ele vator
No one had approached it for re peatedly had looked back to make sure
started to step into the cage
The body of Liu San had vanished
In its place reposed the dead body of Liu Tis sister around her neck the mate of the cord which had strangled Liu Ti
The elevator had become an instrument of hell ish black magic
Two people had been slain in it within the last fifteen minutes or slain elsewhere and dumped into it for me to find by some means couldnt even guess at
was like an automaton geared to run certain distance in straight line
couldnt wouldnt turn back or change my course in one iota come hell or high water
dropped down to the second floor still seeking the trail of Liu Mei
This had to be the last floor for had come to on the first floor to find Liu Mei missing
stepped fearfully over the supine body of Liu Tis sister into the hallway
And almost at once like eyes of cats blinking in the dark saw the shoe
It was tiny shoe and recognized it at once
One of Liu Meis set with the brilliants that peeped forth so alluringly from under the hem of her gown when she walked
It seemed to call to me beseechingly
It seemed to plead
BRJDE FOR DEATH It seemed to threaten to challenge me
It took all of my courage to walk down the hallway to that single shoe to stare down at it
It rested on its side at the top of flight of stairs
It was Liu Meis shoe without doubt
She had kicked it off for me to find or had she
Maybe her captors had left it there to lead me to destruction
What would happen to me if picked it up and went with it down the stairs
Those stairs strangely were ominously black filled with ebon fore boding of disaster to come
The whole building seemed to have fallen silent to listen to what
To the beating of my own terrified heart
wouldnt take the black stairs
They led down to the first floor
Id take the elevator stubbornly as had taken it hitherto
This time expected to find that some other horror had developed in my absence
But no
The door of the cage was still open and the sister of Liu Ti still sprawled supine on the floor
started to shut the door when the cry came shrill piercing filled with agony and with terror
Gordon Bais The cry came from the depth of that black stairwell whence steps led down into God knew what
That it had been the voice of Liu Mei knew for certainty as raced for the stairs
And scarcely had the echoes of my footfalls started in the liallway again than it came once more with something added Gordon Go back
Go back
Dont fol And there it broke short off and knew that hand had closed tightly over her mouth dirty hand grimy Chinese hand like the hands which had beaten me smelly hands hands which it were sacri le to use upon the person of Liu Md
If could get my hands on the fellow who had stopped her
Even for touching her would tear his heart out with steely finr gers
didnt realize she had warned me back until had plunged headlong into the black stairwell to be swallowed by darkness redolent with the odor of in cense and Liu Meis perfume
saw her then vanishing into the hall way on the first floor around the comer of the stairwell below carried backward upright in the big arms of two huge men whose faces could not see but which knew were devilmasked
Something struck me at the base of the skull and rolled down the rest of the stairs numb from the blow but know ing as rolled that my attacker was right behind coming to strike me in
hit the bottom and fought for the strength to meet him when he reached me
CHAPTER THREE Where Is Uu Mei
WHOLE body as dragged stub bomly to my feet seemed to be made of lead
My arms were unbearaWe bur dens my legs were almost too heavy to drag under me
My neck was stiff almost immovable as twisted it by great effort of will to face the man who came down tlie stairs behind me
Chinese of course and huge one wearing devils mask
couldnt have handled him man for man had been in full possession of my faculties and he unarmed
As matters stood was on my feet but out helpless and he carried club in both hands
He wore the queue most unusual in modern Chinese and it looked like snake above his mask
His teeth were showing in snarl or grimace of murderous amusement
He was like something out of nightmare
raised my hands or tried to to ward off the blow he was sending at my IL But my tends wouldnt move and the blow TERROR TAIBS landed
It landed with dull sound as though he had struck the head of drum and scarcely felt it at all
That one thing told me how close was to death
He had brought the chib down whh both hands
had tried to pull my head out of the way
think the blow was glancing one
It must have been else it would have driven my head down into my shoulders
He came at me striking again
My right shoulder
well think it was almost broken by that first blow
had no de fense whatever except my wits
And certain knowledge of Cantonese
Now used the latter knowledge and heard singsong words burble madly through my lips lips that felt diick as untanned leather
Te figure of the Chi nese danced before my eyes until there seemed to te two of him as oke the words must get to liu Mei
She has done nothing
What they do to her His answer was so strange that for long moment did not understand him
You know the ancient Cantonese cus tom of the broken urn Um
What has Liu Mei to do with urns This he answered falling back lit tle because had managed to lift my left foot against him to keep him from getting too close
That Chinese husband ex pects his wife ft come to him as forgn ers call it idean
If he finds it is not so he ends her back to her fafter on rattling cart broken urn swinging below broken urn surrounded by bits of metal that dink
The hoiTor it drove most of the numbness out of me then and there
loved the Chinese always had the bad whh the good but had never been able to thifdc of thdr heartlessness to women without shudder of revulsion
But Lilt Hei can not thus be sent back
Again that horrible rattling in my throat which could scarcely reccize as my own voice speaking Cantonese
There is no finer more suitable woman anywhere That is true he said at the moment
But when we have finished whh her He left it there and knew the full meaning of his horrible fangshowing grimace
Uu Mei was to be given to these monsters
She was being taken away to that fate even as we spoke
Afteniard Kwan Tao being Chinese could no more have taken her to wife than he could have denied his belief in gods and devils on the rivers of his native land
It wasnt the first time fragile delicate Chinese woman had been given to mob
And here was numb with hurt un able to stop this imspealable hoiTor and Liu Mei already gone
Nothing had hap pened to her so far only because her cap tors must first make sure of me
They had no desire for foreign police to break in ou them
cried out in agony
was desperate savage man at that moment who couldnt be hurt any more
Whether loved Liu Mei or not Id have gone to help her be cause she was woman and lier captors bloodmad brutes
My desperation lent power to my bands my feet
lunged at my attacker with my head down like footbfdl player smash ing the line
Again his club crashed down on me
This time took most of the trific blow my shoulderbbdes but almost intolerable pain shot through my entire body Then my head crashed into the mans stomach
He was tdcen by surprise by form of attack new to him and went violently backward to the floor striking his head with sickening thud
The club rolled from his hands
saw it and resolved tliat whatever happened to Liu Mei none of it wotdd be because of this man at my feet
BRIDE FOR DEATH picked up the dub
remembered the blows which had crashed against my skull
Must have been mad beast in my own right
With all my power smashed the club down on his head just as he lifted it from the floor
As it struck the top of his skull felt the club sink in or the wood give and his head dropped back soddenly upon the floor
Something red and sinuous like crim son snake crept out from his mask slug gislily crawling
Still with the dub in my hand whirled and ran sluggishly along the way those two had gone with Liu Mei scarcely realized that the blood from my own wounds was streaming down my cheeks until tasted its salt on my lips
Another flight of stairs led down into darkness
didnt hesitate
CRASHED down those stairs and from that moment on what happened was kind of blur
There were masked men on the stairs and struck at them savagely with all my power
felt the club crack against skulls cheeks against bodies
rammed the end of It into bel lies but allowed none of this to stay my headlong plunge down those stairs
It was dark that basement where struck the bottom of the stairs but far ahead of me saw faint glow of light and knew that was somewhere in the labyrinth under Chinatown that maze of tunnels and passageways which no white man ever sees
There were men behind me but they feared my bloody swinging club
Be sides was mouthing weird cries which sounded insane even to me and Chinese have dread respect for the insane
Knowing this the inspiration came to pretend insanity to keep it up until the last
If theyd realize that insane or not as aiming directly at the freeing of Liu Mei they would know was not mad but if acted fast enough they wouldnt have time to think
came to that glow of fight It was tunnel mouth and in the tunnel dashed to the first turnii
Even here could see that it led to another basement and vast room outfitted with gaudy lavishness
The room was filled with coolies scores of them standing facing their master with becoming servility masked heads bowed
There was one man on dais man in gorgeous robes with black cap on his head topped by red coral button
He wore the fivestrand beard of venerable wisdom and there was no smile on his lips nor mask upon his face
Bound gagged fastened to column which up held the roof stood Kwan Tao
He was struggling with hie bonds
His eyes were shooting flames
stared at him as ran
He was naked to the waist and his torso was mass of blood
Kwan Tao had been beaten with the bamboo until his skin and flesh had been shredded
His chest was crimson and dripping and horrible
It made me think of the ghastly death of thousand cuts but know Kwan Tao wasnt think ing of those wounds those ghastly wounds which would have killed white man
Standing between two coolies before the man on the dais was Liu Mei
Her face was deadly white but she stood proudly erect like soldier
saw the lips of the man on the dais and they were moving but what the man said couldnt make out
Yet was close enough to have heard
saw the lips of Liu Mei move in an swer
saw her head thrown back as though she flung defiance into the face of the seated man
His face was twisted into bestial lines as he listened
But why couldnt hear what was being said
Had TERROR TALES something happened to my senses as Ihe result of the beatings had taken
The whole thing was utterly weird
It was tiice watching silent motion picture and hearing not even the machine which ran it
Yet all of these people were alive unless were looking into vart mirror which seemed impossible
The man on the dais suddenly rose shot out his hand and slapped Liu Mei twice once on either side of the face so hard that thought her head would be knodd from her shouidets knew that acrcMned for could see her moutii open but teard no sound
The Chinese master stood there in his wrath and knew that he heaped that wrath upon this woman who defied Win
Her uncle his sister Mid God knew who rfse had already paid the penalty for something
had seen two sister and brother of Liu Ti and knew some of the answer
When any Chinese tribunal sentenced man to death his whole fam ily dial with him
for what good did it do to destroy the tiger Mid spare die cute Only Kwaa Tao they had spared for the moment at least kit in the end lie would go the same way
Just now tliougli they wished hhn to know to the full the huntihation to be visited upon Liu Mei
HAD the mt terrible feeling as hurled ojyseif toward this ghastly tab leau that was man in nightmare with someiMie loved in dangw and my own feet rooted to the ground so that could not move while death raixd upon me from the rear
It was like swimming in glue for ward march because of my weakness
My feet drammed against the tunnel floor but seemed to talce me forward not at all
My club was altnost too heavy to hold
had to clutch it with all the strength of my two hands
wondered if Lm Mei didnt know was here trying my best to get to her if only that might ay her myself to save her from what the monsters would do to her
Did she guess
As tiiough in answer to my thought she turned and looked diredy at me
thought her right hand lifted palm toward me as though she would order me to get back to save myself
But she couldnt possibly liave seen me
knew that instantly and yet in some strange fashion she must have known was there trying my best to reach her
There where hideously masked faces all around me
Qiinese blocking my retreat had wished to re treat They didnt offer to touch me again
They merely laughed horrible cackling laughter which shodc their bodies witli their gliouUsh glee and they were laugh ing at me
whirled burled myself forward again
struck something an invisible mysterious something in fidl stride and it knocked mo flat on my back stunning me again
almost lost my clUb
and all around me they laughed and chattered
scram bled to my feet felt in the air for what ever it was that had knocked me down
My hands came in terrifying contMt with an expanse of spotlessly clean glass of such dimensions that it sliut me in the tunnel entirely yet let me see the hwror of tbe room bond
CHAPTER FOUR HfiS Bow IlffANY tilings were made plain to me in that one agonizing moment
knew or guessed sometiiing of what must have happened
Coming down in the ele vator Liu Mei and had passed floor just after some sort of wflatHe
drug hid den in the odor of meense perhaps had BRIDE FOR DEATH been blown through the grill
It had in stantly rendered both of iis inanimate
The cage had automatically stopped at the ground floor where had been taken out
Then the enemy on the other floor had pressed the signal and the cage had gone back up bearing Liu Mei helpless un conscious of what was happening to her into the hands of her enemies
had awakened in the cage again and had been beaten horribly because was too numb and stupid from the drug to fight back
Why had the Chinese gone about their work in so elaborate fashion when single knife thrust would have done for me and left Liu Mei in their hands
There seemed at the moment just one ex planation the one had given myself
They played with me to keep me from going out and bringing the white police
And they didnt kill me solely because they dldnt know for sure that hadnt told police to come looking for me if didnt reappear in certain length of time
And this glass in the tunnel shutting me off from the room beyond
could imagine why it was there
Not for my personal and special confounding but so that enemies of this imholy group or peo ple who doubted its power might see what the monsters were capable of doing
couldnt go forward
The tunnel be hind me was packed with Chinese
Knowledge of my plight drove me mad
In few moments something terrible would happen to Liu Mei
had to reach her
think desperation must have given me the strength of many men
stepped back from that expanse of glass
felt my biceps bulge
Power unimaginable power seemed to swell and distend my every nerve and muscle
The world whirled
The tunnel spun
hurled myself at that glass
didnt feel my hurts
It was as though my anger had nullified my agony
Sweat dripped from me the salty sweat of cornered brute beast
My chib crashed against that glass with all the power had
As it did every face and every mask in the room beyond was turned toward me
Liu Mei turned and her hand went to her mouth
Her eyes were big with terror
great jagged star showed in the glass
felt someone hurl himself at me from behind
spun swung instinctively lifted my aim little and crashed my stick in the mans mouth
It must have knocked out every tooth his head
He turned back somersault into the press behind him
But didnt even wait to see him strike among his fellows
whirled back to the glass again seiz ing the split seconds left before the enemy behind overpowered me
The first crash of my bludgeon against the glass had sounded like the crack of doom
The second was even worse for slivers of glass broke free and clattered into the tunnel in jagged shards while others fell in the rown beyond
Berserk now un stoppable desperate with terror swung and swung again
smashed through
The opening was small but stepped back and hurled my self through it just the same
Jagged points like thousand swords struck me caught at my clothing ripped my flesh was sobbing and cursing
would reach Liu Mei
would free Kwan Tao
STAGGERED to my knees beyond the glass turning little to see the smaller Chinese coming through the glass after me
paused just moment to crack down on the skulls of the first two
did not spare my strength and there were other TERROR TALES spfaffers of crimson on the glass when again swung back to the occupimts of that hateful room
My enemies in the tunnel aghast that one man could be so murderously destructive and drawn back
NcfW could hear the voices of die men in the room had so violently and madly entered
The man on the dais Sdze the rl Take her to the room beyond
Half the coolie with her the other half here to slay this meddler The coolies divided as though they had alreaffy been instructed
Kwan Tao bleeding Iwrror tugged witliout cessation at his fionds
The man on the dais scarce ly moved nor did the expression on his face change
CooRes jumped between the girl and me
Through their ranks saw the others bearing the girt to the other room
had no trouble gusing what woufd happen there
But no damned coolies could keep me from reaching her
swung into that first group with all njy desperate ftrry
One went down with smashed tll
heard the man on the dais The first man to break ground before bid him dies by my hand
snapped glance over my right shoul der
The man on the dais gripped snub nosed automatic in his rit hand
Anotlier Chinese vtut down
Despera tion drove the other coolies as they stood shoulder to shoulder to fight me off
There were stiH more aming through the glass behind me knew
But didnt take time to turn
swept die heavy end of that club along the faces of my enemies not to land solidly but to graze ant maim and smash
The effect was horrible the now bloody masks askew
It was like running the end of stick along picket fence save that tire result was bloody horror
And cried out riHy all the tfme
saw the door be yond them open
Liu Mei cast one de spairing look over her shoulder at me as the coolies bore her into that room out of which faint light came
Then she was gone and die smiridng coolies with her and hell had never spawned fury such as became
swung again and missed completely
And this was the reason
The man on the dais had said Enough
Let him try to reach Irer now
You are too iate Gordon Bais
By the time you could rip down tliat door He dit have to finish it
hurled myself toward the door but my mind was not on tliat objective
It held picture of the automatic gripped on the knee of the master of all this horror
couldnt reach him
Bullets woirid travel too fast
His eyes would be following every move now made
had his location fast fixed in my mind
must make no slightest error of judgment
And did not
Al most at the door whirled like dervish and the bluntended club sped from my hands with aH my power and with all the skill that sometimes comes to man in desperate place
It went like shot directly for the chest of the man on the dais
His moQth opened to scream
But the sound never got out
His right hand Italf swung toward me but he didnt have time to pull the trigger
The bhint dub struck him in the dhest and bones and cartdage must have given back before the hurtling projectile
The man toppled badeward from his dais
was right behind my strange weapon of offense while the cooKes slow thinkers almost incapable of executing anytititig without the command of some superior stared at me like so many yellow statues
Only their es moved
grasped the unconscious tealer by the throat yanked him to fiis feet
BRIDE FOR DEATH shook him
had to bring him to
grabbed at his automatic held it in my right hand so that its muazle menaced the wall of coolies who now surrounded me
Make one move against me said hoarsely and ITl twist this mans head from his shoulders They knew meant it and this man was their rice their living their master
No move was made by any one
The man was coming around
Where is the key to that room de manded
If dont get it Ill still kill this monster Nobody spoke
The unconscious man couldnt
Kwan Tao still struIed with his bonds
snapped at the nearest coolie in whose belt was knife
Loose his gag
Cut his bonds COOLIE had ever obeyed mas ter more quickly
Kwan Tao stepped free
His face his whole body had been so harshly tortured that it was next to impossible to recognize him
Where is the key Kwan Tao de manded
On his left wrist hidden under the sleeve found it fastened by thong
yanked it free breaking the thong but only after it had cut deeply into the mans flesh
dragged him to the door
com manded Kwan Tao to hold him there
If anything has happened to her said this man will wish to God he had never been born Kwan Tao didnt answer me
He merely stared
His lips worked spasmodi cally
His face was gargoylesque red mask
Take this gat snapped again and see that the coolies dont follow us into the room twisted the key in the lock
The door ojEiened protestingly
From inside it driv ing me to madness came sounds which were like womans moans of terror
Then words in shrill Cantonese in Liu Meis voice Turtles sons of turtles eggs of tur tles How dare you lay hands on daugh ter of kings And one voice making answer Daughter of kings true but damned to eternity by mingling with the blood of barbarian
Even your ancestors would say that what befalls you will be less than you deserve Then was inside with Kwan Tao be side me dragging the man had all but slain
And what tableau met my eyes
Liu Mei backed against far wall much of her upper garments tom away
Her head was back her shoulders were stiff with pride
Her right hand held knife poised its point aimed at her own heart
The masked coolies were closing on her in tight semicircle like hyenas to the kill
Drop it Liu Mei snapped some one
Out you curs back with your own The crimson Kwan Tao was the spokesman
Liu Mei dropped the knife
The Chinese slunk past us like beaten mongrels
Kwan Tao while relief began to surge through me shut the door locked it put his back against ft Kwan Tao grinned savage red grin
The man he had dragged in with him had vanished
Maybe he had been play ing dead
Maybe well the fact remained that between the second Kwan Tao shoved him against the wall and closed the door the man had snapped into con sciousness and had slipped out behind Kwan Tao
Kwan Tao hadnt closed the door
It had been closed from outside and all three of us were prisoners
We bimgled it said Kwan Tao but maybe it is just as well HBRROR TALES He stared at Liu as did
Hef face wouM never be whiter
She had plainly been through hell wanted to ask her what had happened
Chinese are to us brutally frank
Kwan Tao asked her before could Those coolies
Did they Have coolies ever in all our history asked Liu Mei bitterly failed to take ad antage of women captives She didnt mince words
saw the fece of Kwan Tao change as no torture had ever been able to make it change
No Chinese of his station cotdd possibly ig nore the law of the broken nfn broke in on tlie grim impasHe thing that had come between Kwan Tao and the woman both of us loved
Will some one kindly tell me the meaning of all this will said Kwan Tao and must hurry for we have little time Little time repeated
Yes for even now the snaky tendrils of the yellow smoke comes into this cKam ber from the room of hell beyond The flowery language of the highbom Chinese did not desert him even now whirled and saw the yellow snioke yel low tentacles of it coming in through the keyhole making one think of an inept smoker trying to blow rings
It already had me by the throat
CHAPTER HVE Chineje Blank Watb rU TI said Kwan Tao speaking very rapidly wished me to take Liu Mei in marriage
wished it too proud to have for wife the dauter of Chinese kings
But the tong said no
Lhi Ti fied the tong
They thrtened us with death Liu Ti persisted in his defiance
Liu Ti thought you might help
This is the result
And now my two good friends here we are altogether with but few minutes of life left to us He didnt go toward Liu Mei
knew that centuries of tradition held him apart from her
Modern America would have ridden in its youth over any such barrier as convention had reared between these two especially when the fault was not with Liu Mei
Kwan Tao spoke to her
loved you from the bottom of my heart Liu Ti know Her voice was harsh
But if we were to escape from this pit you would never again so much as touch my hand He didnt nod he couldnt
He didnt shake his head
There was no answer he could give because Liu Mei had already given it
love you too Liu Mei have always loved you said
One might as well speak truly on the brink of the grave where there was noth ing to win or lose loved rou both said Liu Mei speaking as one already dead
And now die alone
It is so unutterably lonely didnt tell them even if there had been time what had befallen their people
They must have guessed anythow
They knew their own kind
whirled on Kwan Tao
Go to her Tao choked
Take her in your arms
What can it matter now when death is so close He looked at her and did not move
In the ear of my mind could hear creaky cart on the streets of Canton with tin kling broken urn swinging below it
could see Liu Mei white face sitting on that cart jeered at by multitudes along the narrow muddy streets
The thought almost broke my heart
started toward Liu Mei and couldnt make it
My feet didnt work properly
BRIDE FOR DEATH staggered almost falling away over to the right
The wall was jumping at me
couldnt lift my arms to ward it off
It struck me in the face knocking me flat
rolled to my side looked at Kwan Tao
He was staring his face mask of agony at Liu Mei
But he hadnt taken step toward her
Now he swayed like tree in hurri cane as the drug which was slaying all three of us got in its deadly work
got to my feet finally and it was like lifting mighty weight
slid against the wall trying to shove myself toward Liu Mei
She was watching me and her eyes thanked me
It must liave hew terrible to delicately nurtured woman to die Uke this with two men who knew what dreadful thing bad happened to her
fina reached her
put arm around it
It was like tryir to lift an arm of lead
sagged against Hie wall
yellow film now sttetdiBd between Kwan Tao and me through which he seemed still to sway
His eyes were still fixed on Liu Mei
thought he was talking but there was ringing in my ears so that was none too sure
Daughter of kings
Blood of kings tliougbt he was saying
Defiled by dregs from die rbttenest gutters of China town
How can turned to Liu lei
It wouldnt matter to me darling whispered my whisper sobbing kind of gasp
know you coalAit help it
would tjdce you in my arms hold you forever and wed both forget She whispesed back
How good it is to know that Gordon Bais on the brink of the Eastern Heaven Shb like Kwan Tko used the flowery speech in crisis
She was all Chinese save that her coloring was almost as light as my own
She to me was an American girl
tried to hold her more tightly
But both of us were swaying and was trying to grip the smooth cold wall with the fingernails of my free liand
felt the nails slide along the stone heard them like thin screaming in my ears
These weird impressions told me that hashish at least in part was in the yellow smoke which destroyed us
There was nothing ahead of us but death
turned to face Liu Mei
Maybe by slapping her by shaking her head could keep her awake
Soon the enemy would open the door
Then perhaps could hurl her out save her
But God help me couldnt manage my hands and arms
All my strength could not lift them
couldnt even take my arm from about the proud graceful shoulders of Liu Mei
VVe were all three doomed
This was the end
We swayed together and tiunk Liu Mei held me up once or twice when would have fallen
My eyes seemed to bulge as looked at that locked door so that the thin tendrils of yrilow smoke became as large fullbodied py thons yellow hideous nightmare py thons shoving their coifs through Gar gantuan keyhole to quest for the three of us
tiled again to tell Liu Mei that it didnt matter
But now no words would pass my lips
My vocal cords would no longer serve me
TiHEN unaccountably was down on the floor on my belly couldnt rise again
couldnt wriggle my fingers
Beside me Liu Mei was standing with her feet wide apart proudly trying to die erect
The yellow film was everywhere
TERROR TALES Kwan Tao still stood weaving sway ing looking at liu Mei
She must have been looking at him too
But she preferred me was sure of that
It was something to take with me into the Hereafter where our heavens would not cross and we should never meet again
Unless the white of Liu Mei came to my heaven
How silly it was But the yellow smoke caused it
And then my heart seemed to stop beat ing for moment
was losing Liu Mei
Perhaps had never had her
Her love yes strange kind of love but part of my life
Now the two of them Kwan Tao and Liu Mei staggering almost falling were moving toward each other
saw them meet
His hands by some superhuman power which did not share because could not move mine at all went out to her
They caught her left arm drew the hand through his elbow
They stood side by side with this strange Chinese handclasp which was the signal of foregiveness of dose harmony of souls
And then though both knew American kisses because both had known the free dom of American schools they were both all China
They were rubbing their cheeks togeth er because the true Chinese did not kiss
They locked in each others arms
Then they fell as tree falls and though saw them strike the hard floor did not hear them because of the ghastly roaring in my ears
They fell sprawled supine but held fast in each others arms and my spirit writhed in agony as they fell
For knew that in those last minutes both had for gotten there had ever been such one as Gordon Bais
took that awful strange agony with me into abysmal darkness where there was nothing but the Niagaralike roaring in my ears
Darkness through which shot long ten drils of yellow smoke engulfed me
REGAINED consciousness in an ele vator that was moving
Strange and horrible and unearthly it seemed
My last memory liad been of Kwan Tao and Liu Mei falling side by side in the room of the yellow smoke forgetting all about me
And here was in moving elevator
My hand was on the control
The cage was dropping
Save that Liu Mei was not here might just have entered it with her
But what hell there had been between
My dazed drugged wits began to come back
noted the passing floors
was dropping from the third to the second
jammed the control to stop the car at the ground floor
ran out
was crazy suppose but it couldnt end like this
had to find Kwan Tao and Liu Mei
went racing through the corridor down the stairs heading for the tunnel where Miu Lei Kwan Tao and had suffered
smashed headon against wall where the door leading down had been
There was nothing
Just smooth wall with no sign that stairway had ever existed here
banged against that panel shouting
couldnt have broken it down with battering ram
The echoes of my cries and my pounding ran eerily all through the bouse
That was all
No other soiwids
Wild with terror raced back to the elevator
Half an hour later had scoured that building from top to bottom and had found not fwie living soul
Nor dead body
And this at the last was the result of my madness had found no trace of Liu Mei or Kwan Tao no hint that Liu Meis uncle BRIDE FOR DEATH had ever even lived here
Every trace of the things which had happened here had vanished
found nothing
satisfied mysetf that was alone in this place that had become mausoleum of dreadful mystery
bat tered against that mystery and could find no answer
tried to find ways down into the warrens and only cold blank panels met my every attempt was beatwi whipped
Id get officers
dashed to the outer door the only one in this place that wasnt locked
raced out looking along the street for police
The door clicked shut and locked be hind me
couldnt get back in
banged against that door untS broke my knnddes
cried out Liu Meis name and Kwan Taos
sobbed with futile rage and despair
This was knew the end
Nobody hi all Chinatown throughout which my cries and battering must have been plaily heard gave the slightest sign until almost an hoftr of madness had passed
Then an old very old Chinese gen tleman came to me looked up and said It is futile for the foreigner to batter his head against the stones
The dead must bury their dead
The past is gone
Nothing can be regained
The task of the Kving Is to forget quickly
In your place my young friend should go back to my own
For never again will you see any of tbe you knew so well no not even though your police tear Chinatown into shreds It took long time to convince me but he did it finally and went home stag gering like drunken man while fingers of yellow mist seemed eternally to be striking the lobes of my brain pushing them ainst the inside of my skull
Out of it all thought crazily the yel low smoke at least would be always with me

THE BLACK CHAPEL OE SEITZ had nsen from puddler to the control cab of the big ladle in less than three years
hard worker Joe Seitz was and the hearth foreman had had his eye on him from the first
Before the first year was out he had seen that Joe was put in charge of furnace No
and the only reason Joe hadnt risen steadily from that time onward was due to no fault of Joes
It just happened that at the time there was no job open to There was pause in the puddler bosss upward progress that lasted almost two years
That two years strained Joe Seitzs patience to the limit and beyond
But Seitz had never workw anywhere but in the steel mills
He didnt know anything else
He had to stick but there was nothing to keep him from advancing up and away from the furnaces
Nothing that is except the fact that Ben Grady had the job he was in line for and in two years time Ben never gave sign of slipping never made mistake never missed days work
It was maddening
Joe Seitz went on three weeks drunk to see if he couldnt think of something to do about it
His brain was sligish and dull when he was sober
Only his motorsensory system worked efficiently seemingly without the stimulant of alco hol
But liquor loosened his imagination gave him ideas
He emerged from the drunk with fullyhatched scheme for removing Ben Grady from his path
Once in while the big ladle got stuck right in the middle of the mill
It always happened when there was full load in it the weight of the molten metal in the huge cauldron making the accident more promote Joe into
likely to occur
There was slight dent on the girder the conveyor traveled on and the bump sometimes sprung dog in the cutoff mechanism so that the circuit to tlie motor was broken
When tluit hap pened the man in tlie control cab had to walk out on tlie girder until he was di rectly over the huge vat of boiling metal in order to reset the cutoff dog
The mill did not have night shift
Business was dull and Seitz had no diffi culty in avoiding the nightwatchman when he came to put his Jan into operation
The plan was very simple
All Seitz did was to crawl out on the girder and grease it thoroughly at the spot that would be directly over the ladle the next time the dog slipped
It did
Ben Grady died horribly and Joe got his job
Ben had screamed when his foot slipped on the grease Seitz had put on the girder
He had screamed again as his body plunged down through space into the ladle of whitehot molten metal
Joe Seitz remembered those screams
He was afraid that he would remember and at intervals seem to hear them in all their braintwisting horribleness until he died
Lately it had been getting tr time the iadle letd the nhfldle ai dw aaiy lapffiiite the wliae die cah wa located Joe Seitz shuddercA He coiid look dowtt iitto the rat from where he perched aad in ian he saw his tQwa body dnging into that lash ir fury of ea soup
He tried to teH himself that it was mercifid death
That didnt help ai
Wfaawver the ladle reached the wlre it used to get uck occaBionaUy Joe could hear Ba Grady scream
The ladle didnt get sftick any fnore
Bqos death had rulted hi the repair of tiiat dent in the gicder
Sonjething like that usually had to hzjpen in mSl bore piece of maclimery was fixed
But Joe continued to hear Ben scream the screams got louder eveay day
Bmally it got to the point where Joe decided he couldnt stand it any niorc This jei that be had waited ee yea Cor that he had worked himself bl the face for that he had even commhted murder ior had turned aour on hm He realized ttiat his nerves were breaking uncter the strain dl waiting to hear Ben scream half dozen tini day
All hk seiwjry nerTefiris whole brain seemed to he centered iti Ins ears every dme the ladle came by with its load
He would at there tense tudvering waiting for the ladle to readi diat middle point
Then he woidd hear Aie screams
set date for hinisdl He decided to quit in two wedks
Hiose two weeks were hell but lie stuck it out
Th dK last day he alitioa changed his mind
Toe first fall ladle went by and he heard ncrthmg
The second started up from the hearths and he Mt nodiing
His nerves remain relaxed
He was as calm and unperturbed as he ever was in his life
The sewad reached the and went on by
Joe heard not It was the same wfth the third
At lunch time Joe was more cheerful than he had ban in moo
He laubed joked with Ws idlovrwwkers with freedbm and spirit carnsnaderie that made them lo at Mna speculatwdy
Tb wondered if lie was dnmk
As fer Joe he was gad that Ijb had not given the foreman notioe

Name Address City
State Kindly mention this magazine when answering advertisements IJT no my friend Jules de Grandin shook his sleek blond head decidedly and grinned across the breakfast table at me we will go to this so kind Madame Normans tea of certainty
Yes But hang it all replied giv ing Mis
Normans note an irritable shove with my coffee spoon dont want to go to confounded tea party
too old and too sensible to dress up in tall hat and long coat and listen to the vaporings of flock of silly flappers
Mordieu hear the savage de Grandin chuckled delightedly
Al ways does he find excuses for not giv ing pleasure to others and always does he frame those excuses to make him more important in his own eyes
Enough of this Friend Trowbridge let us go to the kind Madame Nor mans party
Always there is some thing of interest to be seen if one but knows where to look for it
Hm maybe replied grudg ingly but youve better sight than WEIRD TALES think you have if you can find any thing worth seeing at an afternoon reception
he reception was in full blast when we arrived at the Norman mansion in Tuscarora Avenue that afternoon
The air was heavy with the commingled odors of half hun dred different perfumes and the scent of hotpoured jasmine tea while the clatter of cup on saucer laughter and buzzing conversation filled the wide hall and dining room
In the long double parlors the rugs had been rolled back and young men in frock coats glided over the pol ished parquetry in company with girls in provocatively short skirts to the belching melody of saxophone and the drumming rhythm of piano
Pardicu de Grandin mur mured as he viewed the dancers moment your American youth take their pleasures with seriousness Friend Trowbridge
Behold their faces
Never smile never laugh
They might be recruits on their first parade for
all the joy they show ah
He broke off abruptly gazing with startled almost horrified eyes after couple whirling in the mazes of foxtrot at the farther end of the room
Nom dun fromage he murmured softly to himself this matter will bear investigating think Eh whats that asked pilot ing him toward our hostess
Nothing nothing do assure you he answered as we greeted Mrs Norman and passed toward the din ing room
But noticed his round blue eyes strayed more than once to ward the parlors as we drank our tea and exchanged amiable nothings with pair of elderly ladies
Pardon de Grandin bowed stiff ly from the hips to his conversational partner and turned toward the rear drawing room there is gentlemen here desire to meet if you do not mind that tall distinguished one with the young girl in pink
Oh guess you mean Count Czerny young man laden with an ice in one hand and glass of non Volstead punch in the other paused on his way from the dining room
Hes rare bird all right
knew him back in when the Balkan Allies were polishing off the Turks
Queerlookin duck aint he
First class fightin man though
Why saw him lead bayonet charge right into the Turkish lines one day and when hed shot his pistol empty he went at the enemy with his teeth
Yes sir he grabbed Turk with both hands and bit his throat out hanged if he didnt Czerny de Grandin repeated musingly
He is Pole perhaps His informant laughed bit shame facedly
Cant say he confessed
The Serbs werent asking embar rassing questions about Volunteers nationalities those days and it wasn considered healthful for any of us to do so either
got the impression he was Hungarian refugee from Austrian vengeance but thats only hearsay
Come along Ill introduce you if you wish saw de Grandin clasp hands with the foreigner and stand talking with him for time and in spite of my self could not forbear smile at the contrast they made
The Frenchman was bare five feet four inches in height slender as girl and like girl possessed of al most laughably small hands and feet His light hair and fair skin coupled with his trimly waxed diminutive blond mustache and round unwink ing blue eyes gave him curiously misleading appearance of mildness
His companion was at least six feet tall swarthyskinned and black haired with bristling black mustaches and fierce slategray eyes set beneath beetling black brows
His large nose was like the predatory beak of some THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW bird of prey and the tilt of his long pointed jaw bore out the uncompro mising ferocity of the rest of his vis age
Across his left cheek extending upward over the temple and into his hair was knife or saberscar streak of white showing the trail of the steel in his scalp and shining like silver inlaid in onyx against the blue black of his smoothly pomaded locks
What they said was of course be yond reach of my ears but saw de Grandins quick impish smile flicker across his keen face more than once to be answered by slow languorous smile on the others dark counten ance
At length the count bowed formal ly to my friend and whirled away with wisp of girl while de Gran din returned to me
At the door he paused moment inclining his shoulders in salute as couple of debutantes brushed past him
Some thing know not what drew my attention to the tall foreigner mo ment and sudden chill rippled up my spine at what saw
Above the georgetteclad shoulder of his danc ing partner the counts slategray eyes ere fixed on de Grandins trim back and in them read all the cold malevolent fury with which caged tiger regards its keeper as he passes the bars
What on earth did you say to that fellow asked as the little Frenchman rejoined me
He looked as if he would like to murder you
Ha he gave questioning singlesyllabled laugh
Did he so
Obey the noble Washingtons injunc tion and avoid foreign entangle ments Friend Trowbridge it is bet ter so think But look here began nettled by his manner what Non non he interrupted you must be advised by me my friend
think it would be better if we dis missed the incident from our minds
But stay perhaps you had better meet that gentleman after all
will have the good Madame Norman introduce you
More puzzled than ever followed him to our hostess and waited while he requested her to present me to the count
In lull in the dancing she com plied with his request and the for eigner acknowledged the introduction with brief handclasp and an almost churlish nod then turned his back on me continuing an animated conver sation with the largeeyed young wo man in an abbreviated party frock
And did you shake his hand de Grandin asked as we descended the Normans steps to my waiting car
Yes of course replied
Tell me my friend did you notice anything ah peculiar in his grip
Hm wrinkled my brow moment in concentrated thought
Yes believe did So
What was it Hanged if can say exactly admitted but well it seemed this sounds absurd know but it seemed as though his hand had two baeks no palm at all if that means anything to you
It means much my friend it means very great deal he an swered with such solemn nod that burst into fit of laughter
Be lieve me it means much more than you suspect must have been some two eeks later that chanced to remark to de Grandin saw your friend Count Czerny in New York yester day Indeed
he answered with what seemed like more than necessary interest
And how did he impress you at the time Oh just happened to pass him in Fifth Avenue replied
Id been up to see an acquaintance in Fiftyninth Street and was turning WEIRD TALES into the avenue when saw him driv ing away from the Plaza
He was with some ladies No doubt de Grandin respond ed dryly
Did you notice him particularly
Cant say that did especially answered but it seems to me he looked older than the day we met him at Mrs Normans Yes the Frenchman leaned forward eagerly
Older do you say
Parbleu this is of interest suspected as much
Why began but he turned away with an impatient shrug
Pah he exclaimed petu lantly
Friend Trowbridge fear Jules de Grandin is fool he enter tains all sorts of strange notions had known the little Frenchman long enough to realize that he was as full of moods as prima donna but his erratic unrelated remarks were getting on my nerves
See here de Grandin began testily whats all this nonsense The sudden shrill clatter of my office telephone bell cut me short
Trowbridge an agitated voice asked over the wire can you come right over please
This is Mrs Nor man speaking Yes of course answered reaching for my medicine case what is it whos ill Its its Guy Eckhart hes been taken with fainting fit and we dont seem to be able to rouse him Very well promised Dr
de Grandin and will be right over
Come on de Grandin called as shoved my hat down over my ears and shrugged into my overcoat one of Mrs Normans house guests has been taken ill told her we were coming Mats oui he agreed hurrying into his outdoors clothes
Is it man or woman this sick one Its man replied Guy Eckhart man he echoed incredulous ly
man do you say
No no my friend that is not likely
Likely or not rejoined sharp ly Mrs
Norman says hes been seized with fainting fit and give the lady credit for knowing what shes talking about Eh bien he drummed nervous ly on the cushions of the automobile seat perhaps Jules de Grandin real ly is fool
After all it is not im possible
It certainly isnt agreed fer vently to myself as set the car in motion
VToung Eckhart had recovered consciousness when we arrived but looked like man just emerging from lingering fever
Attempts to get statement from him met with no response for he replied slowly al most incoherently and seemed to have no idea concerning the cause of his illness
Mrs Norman was little more specific
My son Ferdinand found him lying on the floor of his bath with the shower going and the win dow wide open just before dinner she explained
He was totally un conscious and remained so till just few minutes ago Ha is it so de Grandin mur mured half heedlessly as he made rapid inspection of the patient
Friend Trowbridge he called me to the window what do you make of these objective symptoms soft frequent pulse fluttering heart suffused eyes hot dry skin and flushed hectic face Sounds like an arterial hemor rhage answered promptly but theres been no trace of blood on the boys floor nor any evidence of stain on his clothing
Sure youve checked the signs over Absolutely he replied with vigorous double nod
Then to the THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW young man Now mon enfant we shall inspect you if you please Quickly he examined the boys face scalp throat wrists and calves finding no evidence of even pin prick let alone wound capable of causing syncope
Mon Dieu this is strange he muttered of surety it has the queerness of the devil
Perhaps the bleeding is internal but ah regard ez vous Friend Trowbridge He had turned down the collar of the youngsters pajama jacket more in idle routine than in hope of discov ering anything tangible but the livid spot to which he pointed seemed the key to our mysterys outer door
Against the smooth white flesh of the young mans left breast there showed red angry patch such as might have resulted from vacuum cup being held some time against the skin and in the center of the dis coloration was double row of tiny punctures scarcely larger than needlepricks arranged in horizontal divergent arcs like pair of paren theses laid sidewise
You see he asked simply as though the queer bloodinfused spot explained everything
But he couldnt have bled much through that protested
Why the man seems almost drained dry and these wounds wouldnt have yielded more than cubic centimeter of blood at most He nodded gravely
Blood is not entirely colloidal my friend he re sponded It will penetrate the tis sues to some extent especially if sufficient force is applied But it would have required powerful suction replied when his rejoinder cut me short Ha you have said it my friend
Suction that is the word But what could have sucked mans blood like this was in nearstupor of mystification
What indeed he replied grave ly
That is for us to find out
Meantime we are here as physicians
quartergrain morphine injection is indicated here think
You will adminster the dose have no license in America hen returned from my round of afternoon calls next day found de Grandin seated on my front steps in close conference with Indian John
Indian John was town character of doubtful lineage who performed odd jobs of snow shoveling furnace tending and grass cutting according to season and interspersed his man ual labors with brief incursions into the mercantile field when he peddled fresh vegetables from door to door
He also peddled neighborhood gossip and retailed local lore to all who would listen his claim to being hundred years old giving him the standing of an indisputable authority in all matters antedating living mem ory
Par dieu but you have told me much mon vieux de Grandin de clared as came up the porch steps
He handed the old rascal handful of silver and rose to accompany mo into the house
Fiiend Trowbridge he accused as we finished dinner that night you had not told me that this town grew up on the site of an early Swed ish settlement Never knew you wanted to know defended with grin
You know the ancient Swedish church perhaps he persisted
Yes thats old Christ Church answered
Its down in the east end of town dont suppose it has hundred communicants today
Our population has made some big chang es both in complexion and creed since the days when the Dutch and Swedes fought for possession of New Jersey WEIRD TALES You will drive me to that church right away at once immediately he demanded eagerly
guess so agreed
Whats the matter now Indian John been telling you lot of fairytales
Perhaps he replied regarding me with one of his steady unwinking stares
Not all fairytales are pleas ant you know
Do you recall those of Chaperon Rouge how do you say it Red Riding Hood
and Blue beard
Huh scoffed theyre both as true as any of Johns stories Ill bet
Undoubtlessly he agreed with quick nod
The story of Bluebeard for instance is unfortunately very true tale indeed
But come let us hasten would see that church to night if may hrist church the old Swedish plaee of worship was combined demonstration of how firmly adz hewn pine and walnut can resist the ravages of time and how nearly three hundred years of weather can de molish any structure erected by man
Its roughpainted walls and short firmbased spire shone ghostly and pallid in the early spring moonlight and the cluster of broken and weath erworn tombstones which staggered up from its unkempt burying ground were like soiled white chicks seeking shelter from soiled white hen
Dismounting from my ear at the wicket gate of the churchyard we made our way over the level graves in maze of wonderment de Gran din with an eagerness almost childish
Occasionally he flashed the beam from his electric torch on some monu ment of an early settler bent to de cipher the worn inscription then turned away with sigh of disap pointment paused to light cigar but dropped my halfburned match in as tonishment as my companion gave vent to cry of excited pleasure
Triomphe he exclaimed delight edly
Come and behold Friend Trowbridge
Thus far your lying friend the Indian man has told the truth
Regardcz He was standing beside an old weathergnawed tombstone once marble perhaps but appearing more like brown sandstone under the ray of liis flashlight
Across its upper end was deeply cut the one word SAHAH while below the name appeared verse of halfobliterated doggerel Lot noiuie difturb her deathleffe fleepe Abote ye tombe wilde garlick keepe For if fhee wake much woe will boaft rayfe Faither Sonne Holie Goaft
Did you bring me out here to study the orthographical eccentrici ties of the early settlers
demand ed in disgust
Ah bah he returned
Let us consult the ecclesiastique
He per haps will ask no fool questions
No youll do that answered tartly as we knocked at the rectory door
Pardon Monsieur de Grandin apologized as the whitehaired old minister appeared in answer to our summons we do not wish to dis turb you thus but there is matter of great import on which we would consult you
would that you tell us what you can if anything con cerning certain grave in your churchyard
grave marked Sarah if you please
Why the elderly cleric was plainly taken aback dont think there is anything can tell you about it sir
There is some mention in the early parish records believe of woman believed to have been murderess being buried in that grave but it seems the poor creature was more sinned against than sinning
Several children in the neighborhood THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW died mysteriously some epidemic the ignorant physicians failed to un derstand no doubt and Sarah whatever the poor womans surname may have been was accused of kill ing them by witchcraft
At any rate one of the beieft mothers took venge ance into her own hands and strangled poor Sarah with noose of wellrope
The witchcraft belief must have been quite prevalent too for there is some nonsense verse on the tombstone concerning her deathless sleep and an allusion to her waking from it also some mention of wild garlic being planted about her
He laughed somewhat ruefully
wish they hadn said that he add ed for do you know there are gar lic shoots growing about that grave to this very day
Old Christian our sexton declares that he cant get rid of it no matter how much he grubs it up
It spreads to the surrounding lawn too he added sadly
Cor dieu de Grandin gasped
This is of the importance sir
The old man smiled gently at the little Frenchmans impetuosity
Its an odd thing he comment ed there was another gentleman asking about that same tomb few weeks ago pardon the expression foreigner So de Grandin little waxed mustache twitched like the whiskers of nervous tomcat
foreigner do you say
tall rawboned flesh less living skeleton of man with scar on his face and white streak in his hair wouldnt be quite so severe in my description the other answered with smile
He certainly was thin gentleman and believe he had scar on his face too though can be certain of that he was so very wrinkled No his hair was entirely white there was no white streak in it sir
In fact should have said he was very advanced in age judging from his hair and face and the man ner in which he walked
He seemed very weak and feeble
It was really qiiite pitiable Sucre nom dun fromage vert de Grandin almost snarled
Piti able do you say Monsieur
Pardieu it is damnable nothing less He bowed to the clergyman and turned to me
Come Friend Trow bridge come away he cried
We must go to Madame Normans at once right away immediately hats behind all this mys tery demanded as we left the parsonage door
He elevated his slender shoulders in an eloquent shrug
only wish knew he replied
Someone is working the devils business of that am sure but what the game is or what the next move will be only the good God can tell my friend turned the car through Tunlaw Street to effect shortcut and as we drove past an Italian green grocers de Grandin seized my arm
Stop moment Friend Trow bridge he asked would make purchase at this shop We desire some fresh garlic he informed the proprietor as we en tered the little store considerable amount if you have it
The Italian spread his hands in deprecating gesture
We have it not Signor he declared
It was only yesterday morning that we sold our entire supply His little black eyes snapped happily at the memory of an unexpected bargain
Eh what is this de Grandin demanded
Do you say you sold your supply
How is that know not the other replied
Yesterday morning rich gentle man came to my shop in an automo bile and called me from my store
He desired all the garlic had in stock at my own price Signor and at once
was to deliver it to his WEIRD TALES address in Rupleysville the same day Ah de Grandins face assumed the expression of crossword fiend as he begins to see the solution of his puzzle
And this liberal purchaser what did he look like The Italian showed his white even teeth in wide grin
It was fun nay he confessed
He did not look like one of our people nor like one who would eat much garlic
He was old very old and thin with muchwrinkled face and white hair he Nom dun chat the Frenchman cried then burst into flood of tor rential Italian
The shopkeeper listened at first with suspicion then incredulity finally in abject terror
No no he exclaimed
No Signor santissi ma Madonna you do make the joke
Do so de Grandin replied
Wait and see foolish one Santo Dio forbid The other crossed himself piously then bent his thumb across his palm circling it with his second and third fingers and extending the fore and little fingers in the form of pair of horns
The Frenchman turned toward the waiting ear with grunt of inarticu late disgust
What now asked as we got under way once more what did that man make the sign of the evil eye for de Grandin Later my friend will tell you later he answered
You ould but laugh if told you what sus pect
Pie is of the Latin blood and can appreciate my fears Nor would he utter another word till we reached the Norman house
tkowbridge Dr de Gran din
Mrs Norman met us in the hall you must have heard my prayers Ive been phoning your office for the last hour and they said you were out and couldnt be reached
Whats up asked
Its Mr Eckhart again
Hes been seized with another fainting fit
He seemed so well this afternoon and sent big dinner up to him at oclock but when the maid went in she found hjm unconscious and she declares she saw something in his room Ha de Grandin interrupted
Where is she this servant
would speak ith her Wait moment Mrs Norman answered ll send for her
The girl an ungainly young Southern negress came into the front hall sullen dissatisfaction writ ten large upon her black face
Now then de Grandin bent his steady unwinking gaze on her what is it you say about seeing someone in the young Monsieur Eck hart room hein Ah did see sumpin too the girl replied stubbornly
All don care who says All didnt see nothin Ah says Ah did
Ahd just toted tray vittles up to Mistuh Eck hart room an when Ah opened de do dere wuz woman dere wuz woman yas sar skinny black eyed white woman abendin ober um an an And what if you please de Grandin asked breathlessly
Abitin um the girl replied defiantly
Ah don care whut Mis Norman says she wuz abitin um
Ah seen her
Ah knows hut she wuz
Ah done hyeah tell erbout dat ol Sarah woman what come up out er grave wid long rope erbout her neck and go round bitin folks
Yas sar an she wuz abitin um too
Ah seen her Nonsense Mrs Norman com mented in an annoyed whisper over de Grandins shoulder
Grand Dieu is it so de Gran din explained and turning abruptly THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW leaped up the stairs toward the siek mans room two steps at time
See see Friend Trowbridge he ordered fiercely when joined him at the patients bedside
Behold it is the mark
Turning back Eekhart pajama collar he displayed two in cised horizontal ares on the young mans flesh
There was no room for dispute they were undoubtedly the marks of human teeth and from the fresh wounds the blood was flowing freely
As quickly as possible we staunched the flow and applied restoratives to the patient both of us working in silence for my brain was too much in whirl to permit the formation of intelligent questions while de Gran din remained dumb as an oyster
Now he ordered as we com pleted our ministrations we must back to that cemetery Friend Trow bridge and once there we must do the thing which must be done What the devils that asked as we left the sickroom
Non non you shall see he promised as we entered my car and drove down the street
Quick the crankhandle he de manded as we descended from the ear at the cemetery gate it will make serviceable hammer He was prying hemlock paling from the graveyard fence as he spoke
We crossed the unkempt cemetery lawn again and finally paused beside the tombstone of the unknown Sarah
Attend me Friend Trowbridge de Grandin commanded hold the searchlight if you please He pressed his poeket flash into my hand
Now He knelt beside the grave pointing the stick he had wrenched from the fenee straight downward into the turf
With the crank of my motor he began hammer ing the wood into the earth
Farther and farther the rough stake sank into the sod de Grandin blows falling faster and faster as the wood drove home
Finally when there as less than six inches of the wicket projecting from the graves top he raised the iron high over his head and drove downward with all his might
The short hair at the back of my neck suddenly started upward and little thrills of horripilation chased each other up my spine as the wood sank suddenly as though driven from clay into sand and low hopeless moan like the wailing of frozen wind through an icecave wafted up to us from the depths of the grave
Good God whats that asked aghast
For answer he leaned forward seized the stake in both hands and drew suddenly up on it
At his sec ond tug the wood came away
See he ordered eurtly flashing the pocket lamp on the tip of the stave
For the distance of foot or so from its pointed end the wood was stained deep dull red
It was wet with blood
And now forever he hissed be tween his teeth driving the wood in to the grave once more and sinking it full foot below the surface of the grass by thrusting the crankhandle into the earth
Gome Friend Trowbridge we have done good work this night
doubt not the young Eekhart will soon recover from his malady is assumption was justified
Eck harts condition improved stead ily
Within week save for slight pallor he was to all appearances as well as ever
The pressure of the usual early crop of influenza and pneumonia kept me busily on my rounds and grad ually gave up hope of getting any information from de Grandin for shrug of the shoulders was all the answer he vouchsafed to my ques tions
relegated Eekhart inex plicable hemorrhages and the blood WEIRD TALES stained stake to the limbo of never tobesolved mysteries
But ood mornin gentlemen De tective Sergeant Costello greet ed as he followed Nora my household factotum into the breakfast room its sorry am to be disturbin your meal but theres little case puz zlin th department that Id like to talk over with Dr de Grandin if you dont mind He looked expectantly at the little Frenchman as he finished speaking his lips parted to launch upon de tailed description of the case
Parbleu de Grandin laughed it is fortunate for me that have completed my breakfast clier Ser gent for riddle of crime detection is to me like red rag to bullfrog must needs snap at it whether have been fed or no
Speak on my friend beseech you am like Balaams ass all ears The big Irishman seated himself on the extreme edge of one of my Heppelwhite chairs and gazed depre catingly at the derby hat he held firmly between his knees
Its like this he began
Tis one them mysterious disappearance cases gen tlemen an whilst Im thinkin th young lady knows exactly where she at an why shes there hate to tell her folks about it
All th highhat folks aint like you two gentlemen askin your par don sors they mostly seems to think that harness bulls unyform is sumpin like livery like sho furs or footmans or sumpin an that plainclothes man is just sort inferior servant
They dont give th police credit for no brains ysee an when one their darters gits giddy an runs off th reservation if we tells em th gurrls run away of her own free will an accord they say were lot lazy goodfernothin bums who are tryin to dodge our laygitimate jooties be castin mud on th young ladies charaeters dye see
So when this Miss Esther Nor man disappears in broad daylight leastwise in th twilight th day before her dance we suspects right away that th gurrls gone her own ways into th best intentions ysee but we dasnt tell her folks as much or they ll be hollerin to th commis sioner fer to git bran new set detectives down to headquarters so they will
Now mind ye Im not sayin th young lady mightnt been kid naped understand gentlemen but do be sayin tis most unlikely
Ive been on th force man an boy in unyform and in plain clothes fer th last twentyfive years an th number of laygitimate kidnapins young women over ten years of age Ive seen can be counted on th little finger me left hand an aint got none there at all at all
He held the member up for our in spection revealing the fact that the little finger had been amputated close to the knuckle
De Grandin elbows on the table pointed chin cupped in his hands was puffing furiously at vilesmell ing French cigarette alternately sucking down great drafts of its acrid smoke and expelling clouds of fumes in double jets from his narrow aris tocratie nostrils
What is it you say lie demand ed removing the cigarette from his lips
Is it the so lovely Mademoiselle Esther daughter of that kind Ma dame Tuscarora Avenue Norman who is missing Yes sor Costello answered tis tli same young ladys flew the coop accordin to my way think in Mordieu the Frenchman gave the ends of his blond mustache sav age twist you intrigue me my THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW friend
Say on how did it happen and when Twas about midnight last night th alarm came into headquarters the detective replied
Accordin to th facts as we have em th young lady went downtown in th Norman car to do some errands
Weve checked her movements up an here they are He drew blackleather memoran dum book from his pocket and con sulted it
At or thereabouts she left th house arrivin at th Ocean Trust Company at five minutes before th instytootion closed for th day
She drew out three hundred an thir ty dollars an sixtyfive cents an left th bank goin to Madame Gerard where she tried on party dress for th dance which was bein given at her house that night
She left Madame Gerards at leavin orders for th dress to be delivered to her house immeejately an dismissed her shofur at th cor ner Dean an Tunlaw Streets sayin she was goin to deliver some vegy tables an whatnot to pore family she an some her friends was keepin till their old man gits let out jail twas meself an Clancey me buddy that put him there when we caught him redhanded in job housebreakin too
Well to return to th young lady she stopped at Pete Bacigaiupos store in Tunlaw Street an bought basket fruit an canned things at an He clamped his long suffering derby between his knees and spread his hands emptily before us
Yes and de Grandin prompted dropping the glowing end of his cigarette into his coffee cup
An thats all responded the Irishman
She just walked off an no one aint seen her since sor But cordieu
such things do not occur my friend de Grandin protested
Somewhere you have overlooked factor in this puzzle
You say no one saw her later
Have you nothing whatever to add to the tale Well the detective grinned at him there are one or two little in cidents but they aint of any im portance in th case as far as can see
Just as she left Petes store an old gink tried to make her but she give him th air an he went off an didn bother her no more
Id liked to seen th old boy at that
Day before yesterday there was an old felly hangin round by the silk mills annoyin th gurrls as they come off from work
Clancey me mate saw im an started to take im up an darned if th old rummy wasnt strong as bull
Dye know he broke clean away from Clancey an darn near broke his arm in th bargain
Belike twas th same man accosted Miss Norman outside Petes store
de Grandin slender white fingers began beating devils tattoo on the tablecloth
And who was it saw this old man annoy the lady heinf Costello grinned widely Twas Pete Bacigalupo himself sor he answered
Pete swore he recog nized th old geezer as havin come to his store month or so ago in an autymobile an bought up all his en tire stock garlic
Th fool dago said he wouldnt gone after th felly for hundred dollars said he had th pinkeye or th evil eye or some such thing
Them wops sure do bum me up Dim et le diablc de Grandin leaped up oversetting his chair in his mad haste
And we sit here like three poissons davril like poor fish while he works his devilish will on her
Quick sergeant
Quick Friend Trowbridge
Your hats your coats the motor
Oh make haste
WEIRD TALES my friends fly fly implore you even now it may be too late
As though all the fiends of pande monium were at his heels he raced from the breakfast room up the stairs three steps at stride and down the upper hall toward his bed room
Nor did he cease his shouted demands for haste throughout his wild flight
Cuckoo The sergeant tapped his forehead significantly
shook my head as hastened to the hall for my driving clothes
No answered shrugging into my topcoat hes got reason for everything he does but you and cant always see it sergeant You said mouthful that time doe he agreed pulling his hat down over his ears
Hes the dam dest craziest Frog ever seen but at that hes got more sense than nine men out ten To Rupleysville Friend Trow bridge de Grandin shouted as he leaped into the seat beside me
Make haste do implore you
Oh Jules de Grandin your grandfather wasan imbecile and all your ancestors were idiots but you are the greatest zany in the family
Why oh why do you require sunstroke before you can see the light foolish one swung the machine down the pike at highest legal speed but the little Frenchman kept urging greater haste
Sang de Dieu sang de Saint Denis sang du diablel he wailed despairingly
Can you not make this abominable car go faster Friend Trowbridge
Oh ah helas if we are too late
shall hate myself shall loathe myself pardieu shall be come Carmelite friar and eat fish and abstain from swearing VX took scarcely twenty minutes to cover the tenmile stretch to the aggregation of tumbledown houses which was Rupleysville but my companion was almost frothing at the mouth when drew up before the local apology for hotel
Tell me Monsieur de Grandin cried as he thrust the hostelrys door open with his foot and brandished his slender ebony cane before the as tonished proprietors eyes tell me of tin vieillard an old old man with snowwhite hair and an evil face who has lately come to this so detestable place
would know where to find him right away immediately at once
Say the bonifaee demanded truculently where dye git that stuff
Who are you to be askin Thatll do Costello shouldered his way past de Grandin and dis played his badge you answer this gentlemans questions an answer em quick an accurate or Ill run you in see The innkeepers defiant attitude melted before the detectives show of authority like frost before the sun rise
Guess you must mean Mr Zerny he replied sullenly
lie come here about month ago an rented the Hazelton house down th road about mile
Comes up to town for provisions every day or two and stops in here sometimes for He halted abruptly his face suffused with dull flush
Yeah Costello replied
Go on an say it we all know what he stops here for
Now listen buddy he stabbed the air two inches before the mans face with blunt fore finger dont know viiether this here Zerny fellys got tellyphone or
not but if he has you just lay off tellin im were cornin git me
If anyones tipped him th office when we git to his plaee Im eomin back here and plaster more padlocks on this place yours than Sousas got medals on his blouse
Savvy Come away Sergent come away Friend Trowbridge de Grandin be sought almost tearfully
Bandy not THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW words with the cancre we have work to do Down the road we raced in the direction indicated by the hotelkeep er till the picket fence and broken shutters of the Hazelton house showed among rank copse of sec ondgrowth pines at the bend of the highway
The shrewd wind of early spring was moaning and soughing among the black boughs of the pine trees as we ran toward the house and though it was bright with sunshine on the road there was chill and shadow about us as we climbed the sagging steps of the old buildings ruined piazza and paused breathlessly before the paintless front door
Shall knock Costello asked dubiously involuntarily sinking his voice to whisper
But no de Grandin answered in low voice what we have to do here must be done quietly my friends
He leaned forward and tried the doorknob with light tentative touch
The door gave under his hand swinging inward on protesting hinges and we tiptoed into dark dustcarpeted hall
shaft of sun light slanting downward from chink in one of the window shutters show ed innumerable dustmotes fly ing lazily in the air and laid bright oval of light against the warped floorboards
Huh empty as porkbutchers in Jerusalem Costello commented disgustedly looking about the un furnished rooms but de Grandin seized him by the elbow with one hand while he pointed toward the floor with the ferrule of his slender ebony walking stick
Empty perhaps he conceded in low vibrant whisper but not recently mon ami
Where the sun beam splashed on the uneven floor there showed distinctly the mark of booted foot two marks trail of them leading toward the rear of the house
Right yare the detective agreed
Someones left his track here an no mistake Ha de Grandin bent forward till it seemed the tip of his high bridged nose would impinge on the tracks
Gentlemen he rose and pointed forward into the gloom with dramatic flourish of his cane they are here
Let us go
Through the gloomy hall we fol lowed the trail by the aid of Costel los flashlight stepping carefully to avoid creaking boards as much as pos sible
At length the marks stopped abruptly in the center of hat had fonnerly been the kitchen
dis turbance in the dust told here the walker had doubled on his tracks in short circle and ringbolt in the floor gave notice that we stood above trapdoor of some sort
Careful Friend Costello de Grandin warned have ready your flashlight when fling back the trap
Undeuxtroisl He bent seized the rusty ringbolt and heaved the trapdoor back so violently that it flew back with thundering crash on the floor be yond
The cavern had originally been cellar for the storage of food it seemed and was brickwalled and earthfloored without window or ven tilation opening of any sort
dank musty odor assaulted our nostrils as we leaned forward but further im pressions were blotted out by the sight directly beneath us
White as figurine of earven ala baster the slender bare body of girl lay in sharp reverse silhouette against the darkness of the cavern floor her ankles crossed and firmly lashed to stake in the earth one hand doubled behind her back in the position of wrestlers hammerlock grip and made firm to peg in the floor while the left am was extend WEIBD TALES ed straight outward its wrist pin ioned to another stake
Her lux uriant fair hair had been knotted to gether at the ends then staked to the ground so that her head was drawn far back exposing her rounded throat to its fullest extent and on the earth beneath her left breast and beside her throat stood two porcelain bowls
Crouched over her as the relic of man an old old hideously wrinkled witchhusband with matted white hair and beard
In one hand he held long gleaming doubleedged dirk while with the other he caressed the girl smooth throat with gloating strokes of his skeleton fingers
Howly Mither Costellos Coun ty Galway brogue broke through his American accent at the horrid sight below us
My God exclaimed all the breath in my lungs suddenly seeming to freeze in my throat
Bonjour Monsieur le Vampire Jules de Grandin greeted nonchal antly leaping to the earth beside the pinioned girl and waving his walking stick airily
By the horns of the devil but you have led us merry chase Baron Lajos Czuczron of Transylvania
The crouching creature emitted bellow of Yury and leaped toward de Grandin brandishing his knife
The Frenchman gave ground with quick catlike leap and grasped his slender cane in both hands near the top
Next instant he had ripped the lower part of the stick away display ing fine threeedged blade set in the canes handle and swung his point toward the froth ingmouthed thing which mouthed and gibbered like beast at bay
Aah he cried with mocking upwardlilting accent
You did not expect this eh Friend Blooddrinker
give you the party of surprize nestcepas
The cen turies have been long mon vieux but the reckoning has come at last
Say now will you die by the steel or by starvation
The aged monster fairly champed his gleaming teeth in fury
His eyes seemed larger rounder to gleam like the eyes of dog in the firelight as he launched himself toward the little Frenchman
Saha the Frenchman sank backward on one foot then straight ened suddenly forward stiffening his swordarm and plunging his point directly into the charging beast man distended red mouth
scream of mingled rage and pain filled the cavern with deafening shrillness and the monster half turned as though on an invisible pivot clawed with horrid impotence at the wirefine blade of de Grandin rapier then sank slowly to the earth his death cry stilled to sickening gurgle as his throat filled with blood
Fini de Grandin commented laconically drawing out his handker chief and wiping his blade with meticulous care then cutting the un conscious girls bonds with his pock etknife
Drop down your overcoat
Friend Trowbridge he added that we may eover the poor childs nudity until we can piece out ward robe for her
Now then as he raised her to meet the hands Costello and extend ed into the pit if we clothe her in the motor rug your jacket Sergent Friend Trowbridges topcoat and my shoes she will be safe from the chill
Parbleu have seen women refugees from the Boche who could not boast so complete toilette Tith Esther Norman hastily
clothed in her patchwork as sortment of garments wedged in the front seat between de Grandin and me we began our triumphant jour ney home
An would ye mind tellin me how ye knew where to look for th Continued on page KING back one is struck with wonder that we know as much of the story as we do that we comprehend as fully as we do the nature of the strange doom that rushed out onto humanity from lonely hill in southern Scotland
Had it not been for one small thing the casual curiosity of young student that appalling invasion would re main to this day quite unexplained
trifle certainly that passing in terest of rather commonplace young man but except for that interest and what it led to we would understand nothing of the vast drama that was played around and above us
Not that our ignorance or knowl edge could have affected the out come of that drama
Beside the tremendous forces that rose and fought and crashed mankind was but mass of tiny frightened pigmies running about beneath battling giants
Yet one remembers that it was one of those same pigmies it was single embittered insane man who loosed all of that ancient terror upon us and caused an ageold cosmic feud to flare out in dreadful war universe struggling with uuiverse in titanic combat immense unthinkable The story as we know it begins on that sultry afternoon in August when young Ernest Hunter came into the village of Leadanfoot and dis mounted wearily from hi battered bicycle
day of pedaling over the Scotch hills had made him regret somewhat his decision to visit Glas gow on his holiday trip
One of the numberless students who swarm over the English highways each summer on cycles and afoot he began to think that this sidetrip over the border was after all mistake
But once inside the dark cool little inn with mug of foaming cider at hand these doubts fled and the world again seemed very pleasant place
This Hunter lengthy and stooping of figure with thin humorous face was social type and looked about now for possible company
Except for himself there was no one in the long low room but the two men WEIRD TALES who stood near the open door the stocky aproned innkeeper and whitewhiskered wrinkled old man with whom he was conversing
His cider finished Hunter rose and lounged toward them catching few words of their talk
No the innkeeper was exclaiming
Who ever heard thunder like that The other was nodding his agree ment when their conversation was broken into by Hunters friendly voice
Thunderstorm here lately he asked
came through bad one down at Carlisle Wednesday
messy sort of thing
Lightning fired house there
The host contemplated him doubt fully before replying
It was not thunderstorm we spoke of he told him
There was queer thing here dont just know McAndrews here heard it and so did He paused but Hunter was inter ested and questioning him further found that the subject of discussion as series of strange detonations that had been heard throughout the village on the night before succes sion of deeptoned rumbling explo sions that seemed to come from the group of hills west of Leadanfoot
All in the village had heard the sounds and most had set it down as distant thunder but the innkeeper quite evidently disagreed
Like no thunder you ever heard he assiued Hunter Boom boom boom boom boom
Regular like big cannon firing
Ive heard enough thunder in my time and this sound was not like it not like it at all
Eh McAndrews The wrinkled oldster sagely nod ded agreement
Maybe it was blasting you heard Hunter suggested
Some farmer up there doing something of that kind peihaps For moment the innkeeper con templated him with that fine scorn with which the rural native regards stranger ignorant of local geog raphy
Farmer up there he re peated in the tone with which one would reject an unworthy statement
Why theres not house through all those hills
Too steep they are and wild
doubt if single soul has lived there for the last ten years
The aged McAndrews removed his pipe from his mouth to voice dissent
How about the scienteefic chap pies he asked
Well except for them conced ed the host somewhat discomfited while the older man replaced the pipe and regarded him with stern gravity
Possibly to cover up his mistake he went rapidly on with explanations for Hunters benefit
Two science professors they are that have cabin on one of the hills
For near year theyve been there studying the glassy forts hear
never saw them myself for they get everything they need over at Dy kirk
term in his speech caught Hun ters interest
The glassy forts he repeated interrogatively
Theres some piles of old stone ruins on some of the hilltops around here the innkeeper explained
Some of them have parts of stones all melted into glass
Lightning did it suppose
Around here we call them the glassy forts and its them that these men are working with dig ging and such Oh see said Hunter
More slowly he continued Do you know Id like to see some of them if it wouldnt take too long
Do you suppose could in day Well you can if youre good climber his host informed him
Lowder Hill is the nearest to here and they say theres such ruins on top of it
Its not so steep either
Theres another hill right next to THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS Lowder Kerachan Hill but its too high and rough to get up and down in day hardly
Its on Kerachan that the science men are staying think
Youd best try Lowder though Ill stay here tomorrow then Hunter told him and make the trip
Im so infernally tired of ped aling that day of tramping will be rest The prospect had intrigued the young student and before retiring for the night he acquired enough in formation to guide him on the next days trip
Also he had been fur nished with number of weird anec dotes concerning the glassy forts which were evidently objects of local superstition
The sun was an hour high the next morning when he left the inn small package of lunch in his pocket
He swung quickly through the village and tramped steadily over stony roads and rough moor toward the dark looming bulk of the western hills whose sides were almost com pletely hidden by dense forests of fir
Hunter had been advised to climb Lowder Hill from its farther side so on reaching it he walked in great circle around its base through nar row wooded valley that separated it from Kerachan Hill
As he passed along this valley he was struck by its utter peace and quiet
The smal ler forest creatures were frightened away by the sound of his coming but once he glimpsed the vague dun shape of deer slipping through the trees in the distance and now and then startled groups of birds burst tip through the trees at his approach noisily discussing hint in disparag ing terms in their flight
The busy shouting bellowing world seemed in conceivably remote in that tranquil spot
The sun swung higher and higher while he pushed his way forward
And in the world that seemed so very far in Leadanfoot and London and New York and Peking other men were pushing their way forward in their particular groove in life schem ing for disks of metal and slips of paper for the admiration of their fellows for riches or fame or knowl edge
vast mass of tiny conspira tors each intent on his own plots each sublimely confident of the im portance of his especial business and its outcome
And hidden in those quiet hills in to which Hunter advanced was that which was to upset all of those min ute conspiracies like little houses of caids door through which was to come menacing terror unknown to man so that presently through this world and worlds above and beyond would run death and confusion and an ancient dread pHE sun was near its greatest height when Hunter came to the farther side of Lowder Hill and the rude path that twisted up that side
He stared at it rather doubtfully for the hill seemed very steep and the day was almost half gone
Then with shrug he was about to step forward to the path when the sound of step behind him made him wheel in surprize
strange figure was walking to ward him small middleaged man whose clothes were dirty and torn by briars
He was hatless and on his pink round spectacled face was an expression of dazed wonder
He came forward until he was within few yards of the astonished Hunter then stopped and regarded him mildly Not Powell he whispered soft ly confidentially
Not He ceased speaking suddenly looked around with certain sur prize then sank to the ground in dead faint
WEIRD TALES In moment Hunter was by the mans side applying his vagne ideas of first aid
He got his pocket flask between the mans teeth and little brandy down his throat which al most instantly pulled him back to consciousness
The man lay there his eyes sweeping over Hunters face then asked quite unexpectedly What time is it On finding that it was almost noon he straightened to sitting position
Im all right now he assured the student motioning the latter to seat on the ground beside him
His glance wavered about the scene then came back to Hunter whom he regarded intently before addressing him
Who you are dont know he began and as Hunter started to ex plain he added and it doesnt mat ter
Youve had some education havent you
Ah medical student
That makes it easier much easier Hunter began to think that the man was still dizzy delirious
Hadnt better help you back to Leadanfoot he asked
There would not be time the other answered strangely
was going to Leadanfoot myself for But there you do not know
There is time to get back though
You and
But first you should hear He caught the doubting halffear ful expression on the young mans face
No Im not madman he assured him almost gently
But need help badly
Need your help But help for what
asked Hunt er
think if you would just go back with me to the village No answered the other de cisively
There was pause in which the older man stared across the green silence of the valley with unseeing eyes
Suddenly he turned to the watching puzzled student
will put it this way he began
Sup pose someone was planning to kill ev ery living person in the village yon der to wipe it out utterly would you try to prevent it
At Hunters wondering reply he continued Of course you would
Now go farther still
Suppose some one something was trying to kill ev ery human being on Earth to anni hilate the world as we know it
Would you try to stop that too The younger man stared at him blankly
Would you persisted the other
Why yes naturally answered the student and the older man sighed
It is to prevent that that need your help he said quietly
Before Hunter could comment on that startling statement the man rushed on
am going to tell you enough of the matter to help you understand what threatens
You will not think me madman when you hear
We have little time here an hour perhaps before we must start back
But it is enough for me to tell You will wish to know who am
Marlowe is my name and until year ago held position on the staff of the Trent Museum in Lon don
It was there that met Powell some three years ago
Henry Powell he was an elderly physics professor lately re tired from Cambridge
That was all he ever told me of his past for even after we became better acquainted he was closemouthed about his form er career
By chance found the reason for that
friend told me that Powell had left Cambridge un der cloud
It seems that he had been working for many months in collaboration with fellow professor Wooding by name on an element changing experiment
You know transmute uranium into radium or radium into lead
Modern alchemy THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS they were attempting After year of work together the two had split over some disagreement each carry ing on the experiment alone
Wood ing was the first of the two to pub lish his results and immediately Powell claimed that his former part ner in work had stolen his own re sults
There was rather scandal over the matter but an investigating committee ruled that Powells charges were unproved so he was re tired from the university
never talked with Powell on the matter and never learned the right of it but could see that the thing had embit tered him greatly so that he was wont to snarl viciously at all scientific people and in fact nearly all peo ple of any kind
He grated on me considerably sometimes for he was like an animated bottle of acid thin lipped sardonic sneering
But one thing drew us together common interest in archeology
In fact that branch of knowledge was my work at the museum and Powell had taken it up as sort of hobby to occupy his restless mind suppose
We got ac quainted through his visits to the mu seum and had many talk there after
He was intensely interested in the vitrified forts of Scotland as they are called
Piles of stone ruins on some of the Scottish hills and in few valleys with some of the stones melted into glass
Youve heard of them
Well it was Pow ells radical theory that those glassy streaks ere not made by lightning as is commonly supposed but by some powerful weapon or ray striking from above
You will see what revolution in conventional arch eological thought would be the re sult if he could prove that
He got to be fanatic on the subject and spent most of his time roaming about Scotland and hunting and digging in such ruins
TUTe had been off on such trip for several weeks when he sent me an urgent wire from Scotch village named Dykirk
He had made great discovery he said but need ed my help and offered me hand some salary for my aid
My own interest was aroused by his message so procured the necessary leave from the museum and went at once being met by Powell when stepped off the train
It turned out that his discovery was on the summit of hill some miles from Dykirk named Keraclian Hill
He had had little cottage or cabin built on the hill and had lived in it for some weeks
It took us most of the day to get to his little home so we stowed my luggage and waited until the next morning to inspect his discovery
And it was really astounding
The summit of the hill was flat and there with few crumbling stono blocks scattered about but in the center of that level expanse was shallow pit newly dug that was cir cular in shape and perhaps twenty feet across
At its bottom foot or so from the surface of the ground lay flat round stone the surface of which was almost completely covered by mass of strange characters carven into it deeply
It was to decipher this inscrip tion that Powell needed my help for am by way of being an expert in hieroglyphics cuneiform writing and such
He said that he had found this inscription beneath protecting layer of cement of some kind and was afire to learn its meaning as he well might be
So settled in the little cabin and began work that very day
To my surprize found the inscription quite easy to decipher for all that the characters were totally strange and unknown
Whoever had carved it had placed in it here and there small pictures symbols giving key WEIRD TALES for its translation purposely
Within month had translated and ar ranged my translations of it and found that the inscription told stupendous incredible story
According to it these ruins of forfs that lay scattered through Scot land had been built ages before by race of strange folk who had invaded the Earth then
And these strangers had come not from another planet as one might suppose but from single atom in the Earth
This will sound incredible to you as at first it did to me but con sider
We know that each atom of our Earth consists of number of electrons revolving about nucleus and what is that but miniature solar system
Just as our sun and its circling planets may be an atom in vastly larger system and so on infinitely perhaps
The idea is not new it was advanced years ago
And in this particular atom of the Earth on its electrons its tiny planets dwelt race proportionately tiny the atomic people will call them
They had crowded over every one of their electronplanets and were now grad ually stifling from their everincreas ing numbers
They had science strange sort of science and now at the time of their greatest need one of their scien tists announced startling discovery
He had found way by which the size of any object could be increased or decreased indefinitely at will
And the secret of this was stunning in its very simplicity
We know that the universal all pervading ether is the base of every thing
Vibrations of that ether in certain octave cause light in dif ferent octave radio waves in still another chemical rays
But what we do not know as yet what the scientists of the atomic people had learned is that all matter itself is but another vibration of that ether in different lower octave
That stone that tree you and all but different vibra tions in the ether
And the atomic scientists had found that as stone is simply an etheric vibration by rais ing the frequency of vibration the stone would be made larger by lower ing that frequency it would be made smaller
Their method of changing that frequency was told by the inscription
They would ascertain the frequency of vibration of an object then con centrate on it other artificial electric vibrations much like radio waves which would change the vibratory frequency of the object just as the rate of swing of pendulum can be raised or lowered by tiny force ap plied to it at the correct moment
Thus these atomic people could make any object make even themselves large enough to dwarf their world or small enough to disappear entirely
It was chance to relieve their crowding numbers and they seized it at once
Using their discovery to grow in size they burst up from their own atom into this world into our Earth and found that the atom that was their universe was an atom of simple grain of sand on Earth
Thai sandgrain though held their world so they built great structure around it in what is now Scotland so that it would always be there as refuge for them to flee to in ease of need
That attended to up from the atom out of the sandgrain streamed their people gigantic masses of them
The Earth then was savage and forbidding but nothing daunted they spread over its surface began to raise their structures of stone to shape this world to their will
It must have seemed to them that they were secure forever in this greater universe
But now came disaster
Certain adventurous spirits among them were not satisfied to stop in this universe
They saw the sun and its attendant planets and realized that this our own solar system was after all only THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS an atom in still greater universe
So number of them using the same method of changing size grew again until they had entered the world above this the universe in which ours is but an atom
Now in that greater universe in that superworld as shall call it there was civilization civilization of beings who had advanced far beyond the crude semibarbarism of the peo ple of the atom
So when the atomic invaders entered their world the superpeople knew they had come from beneath from an atom for they themselves had long possessed that power of changing size which the atomic people had just discov ered
Although these superpeople promptly beat back the invaders in that first attack time after time in the years that followed the warlike people of the atom persisted in at tempting to enter the superworld which was so much fairer than either their own world or this one
long while their attacks con tinued until finally the patience of the superpeople was exhausted and they gathered together all their forces to crush these atomic invaders foi ever
They poured down from their greater universe to this Earth and then was battle such as was never known before the people of the su perworld and the people of the atom locked in deathstruggle smiting with strange weapons colossal war raging over the shuddering Earth that reeled beneath them
The atomic invaders could not stand against the mighty weapons of the superpeople and soon all of them not slain were fleeing in dread to their own world that sandgrain that held their universe
They sped back to that grain and down into it dwindling in size and vanishing un til of all their number only their dead remained on Earth
And now the superpeople set about to seal them forever within that atom within that sandgrain so that never again should they break out and carry war and death through the superworld
To accomplish this they set that grain of sand within circle of perpetual electric force field of strange force within which it was im possible to grow or dwindle in size as the atomic people had done by changing the frequency of etheric vibration
Thus the people of the atom were locked foiever within their own tiny universe
This accomplished they covered the sandgrain and the forces they placed around it setting over them great stone on which was written the history of what had happened and which warned whoever might find the stone in the future never to tamper with or change what had been done lest they loose again the atomic in vaders upon the Earth and the super world alike
Having done this the superpeople left the Earth to its own devices and passed up into their own greater universe
Came then on Earth the painj ful upward surge of changing as cending species the long road from anthropoid to troglodyte to modern man
The structures of the atomic people crumbled soon until only few remnants were left
Over all the world it was as if their invasion had never been nor did men dream that such people had held the Earth ages before themselves
And up in Scottish hill under great stone that was covered by the drifting dirt of ages lay grain of sand that held war and death and terror in single atom of which the atomic people were prisoned for all time
UCH was the colossal epic the in scription narrated
And it was so convincing that neither Powell nor doubted it
But now dispute arose between us
believed that we WEIRD TALES should heed the warning of the in scription and not delve farther into the thing lest we loose dread upon the world
But Powell was afire with curiosity and ould not listen
So with help we removed the great cir cular stone and set it to one side
And beneath it as it had foretold we found the sandgrain that held the atomic world
Under the circular stone was cube of the same smooth rock some six feet square
On the upper sur face of this cube was set small plate of smooth metal at the center of which lay the sandgrain set in the metal
Around this metal plate em bedded within the surface of the cube was circle of seven little blocks that glowed steadily with feeble purple light
In daylight the little blocks seemed merely purple in color and it was only in darkness that their luminosity became appar ent
Without doubt that circle of glowing blocks was the producer of the force mentioned in the inscrip tion the force that made sizechang ing impossible within their field that held the atomic people prisoners in the sandgrain
From that day onward Powell took me less and less into his con fidence
He had fitted up small laboratory near the cabin and began working there on some problem con nected with what he had found
Once or twice he consulted me eoncernirig the meaning of certain technical parts of the inscription but aside from thgt he told me nothing of what he was doing and decided that was wasting time to stay
It was on the very day that meant to tell Powell so and leave that he came running toward me excitedly with the news that his experiment had succeeded
And when found the nature of that experiment as astounded
He had been attempting to follow up the sparse details given in the in scription and rediscover the method of changing size
And he had done it
He showed me the apparatus he had worked out compact black ease which strapped around his chest and which would cause everything within its field of action to grow or decrease in size
And standing there on the hilltop he grew in size until he towered up giant of hundred feet then dwindled until he was an inch in height tiny manikin
He was exultant and thought that at last he would leave the hill top and cover the sandgrain once more
pointed out to him what good he might accomplish in the world with that great power but he only snarled at me and for the first time revealed his intention
He was planning to dwindle in size until he could enter that atomic world to go down into the sandgrain to the atomic universe
Short of force used all my ef forts to prevent him for was aghast at such plan
But he went on un heeding making his preparations for the trip
He dug out and removed the little circle of blocks around the sandgrain then gradually began to dwindle in size until he was tiny figure few inches high standing on the metal circle near the grain of sand
Smaller and smaller he be came until he vanished entirely from my sight and knew that he had en tered the sandgrain
For three days atched beside the stone cube waiting for his re turn
It was toward evening of the third day that he finally came back tiny upright form on the metal plate that grew swiftly to the man knew
He had come back
He had come back but changed
He seemed to be filled with an im mense excitement to be spurred on by some hidden purpose
He gave small answer to my flood of ques tions
He had found the atomic world had been guided down into THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS that particular atom of the grain by certain signs phrase which he did not explain
As to the people of the atom he said only that there were many of them and that they were different More he would not tell me and my fear my misgivings increased
npHE night of disaster rushed up on us week afjer his return
was asleep in the cabin while Pow ell worked as thought in the lab oratory
Some time after midnight woke and sensed that Powell was not in the cabin
dressed hurried ly and found that he was not in the laboratory either
Instantly knew where he was and hurried up to the hilltop and to the pit on that hilltop that held the stone cube and the sandgrain He was standing on the edge of that pit watching intensely but at the sound of my approach he wheeled instantly holding little stone cone in his hand the end of which glowed suddenly with dull green light
At the same moment fell in heap to the ground and lay there quite motionless seemingly para lyzed unable to move muscle
And Powell laughed
He mocked and taunted me and for the first time dis closed the depth of his plans
He was going to loose once more the atomic invaders upon our world
He had gone down into their world and conspired with those in power there promising to free them from the world where they were prisoners to release them upon the Earth and the superworld
First he boasted the atomic in vaders were to strike at the world be yond this at the superworld to stab out unexpectedly at their ancient en emies in that greater universe crush ing them by an unlookedfor attack
Then free from any possible inter ference the invading hordes would sweep over Earth and he laughed wildly as he pictured to me the de struction of the races of man and their works dwelling especially on the fear and terror of his Powells enemies
For the first time saw that the man was completely insane an embittered maniac who secreted hate for all mankind as the result of his wrongs real or fancied
Even while he spoke slight humming sound arose from the pit
The humming waxed swiftly to loud droning then up from the pit floated black disk some three feet across and swiftly growing
Hover ing few feet above the ground it continued to grow and the droning became loud booming tremen dous rumbling thunder
Even as stared at it lying there fathomed the cause of that rolling thunder knew that it was the sudden expan sion of the disk that beat out
those thick waves of sound
The disk grew until it was perhaps thirty feet across then ceased expanding
It slid gently down toward us until it was nearly touching the ground and saw that it was crowded with dark shapes that pushed toward the rail to stare down at us
Then down from the edge came folding metal ladder and clamber ing down this ladder came three creatures shapes grotesque and ter rible three of the atomic people
had thought of them as being somewhat human perhaps with dif ferent features or coloring but still essentially human
But these things
They were reptilian saurian
In height they were little under the human standard and their figures were even roughly human in shape with the head carried erect squat powerful body two thick bowed low er limbs and two short arms ending in cruel curved talons
But with that rough travesty on the human shape all resemblance ceased
To begin with the things were completely cov ered with thick hard scales like WEIRD TALES those of crocodile
Their heads were peaked instead of round with gaping fanged mouths and small black glittering eyes browless and lashless like the eyes of snake
They were noseless and earless and their only sign of clothing was queer sort of metallic armor that seemed more designed to carry their weapons than as clothing
Lying there motionless regard ing them with sickened horror saw the three advance to Powell who greeted them with queer gesture
One brought forth tablet like small slate on which he wrote then passed it to Powell who studied it then wrote in turn and handed it back
Evidently such writing was Powells only means of communica tion with the things
For few min utes they conferred in that fashion with Powell then returned to the disk which immediately ascended from its hovering position on the hill top
As it rose it grew spreading out swiftly in everexpanding size grow ing until it had shut off the light of all the stars for few seconds then seemingly breaking up into small masses cloudily disappearing
It had become so large that it was in visible had passed from this uni verse into that greater one
For moment wondered if its momentary eclipse of the stars would cause any stargazer to guess at what was hap pening then realized that to any chance watcher of the sky it would seem only like drifting cloud if noticed at all
Again rose the humming from the pit many times louder growing to an earsplitting thunder as another force of the atomic people floated up from the pit great mass of tiny black circles miniatures of the first disk that drifted up and rose at once into the air not stopping to confer with Powell as had the first
And as that mass of disks rose above the hill top the familiar droning was again waxing louder as another mass of them came up
How many of the disks streamed up from the atom while lay there can not guess
Their number seemed infinite but my memories are fragmentary disjointed
must have been unconscious for few minutes at least for remember that amid the rumbling thunder of the rising disks as watched Powell who was gazing triumphantly at their com ing dizzying blackness seemed to descend on my brain and when con sciousness returned the last mass of disks was rising from the pit vanish ing like the others in the sky above
Tntil now Powell had held me prisoner with the glowing cone which he had placed on the ground before conferring with the atomic people so that it held me prisoner without his attention
Now he picked it up and permitted me to reenter the cabin where he forced me to lie down in the bunk then placed the cone again on the table in the room still pointing toward me still holding me prisoner powerless to move
Why he did not kill me outright can not say
think it was only be cause he desired someone even prostrate enemy to whom he might boast of what he was doing that he desired someone to know the power and the menace that he really was
It must have been so for the next day he boasted for hours to me of what he was doing
He spoke of the great force of invaders had seen and said that even by that time their numbers and mighty weapons would have crushed into submission the people of the superworld
He spoke too of the paralyzing cone that held me prisoner weapon which he had brought back from the atomic world and revealed that he had another one on his person also
It was he said ray that neutralized THE ATOMIC CONQUEKORS the electric messages in the nervous system thus wiping out the com mands of the brain in that system so that while reflex actions like the breathing of the lungs and beating of the heart were unaffected the con scious commands of the brain to the muscles were nullified paralyzing those muscles
All of that day and all through the next night lay in the bunk without moving muscle save only an hour in which he permitted me to eat heard him leave the cabin early the next morning the second after the coming of the invaders this very morning
Lying there listened with dull despair to the wind slam ming the door of the cabin
The cone on the table was in the line of my vision and suddenly gasped with hope for at particularly hard slam that cone had rolled little way toward the tables edge
waited breathless
Then just as my hope was beginning to die the door slammed to with all the winds force behind it and the cone rolled from the table to the floor breaking and exploding there in flash of intense green light My first move was to search the cabin for gun but there was none
The cabin stood at the edge of the bare and treeless hilltop and from its window could see Powells head bobbing about in the pit of the sand grain as he prepared for the coming of the second force of invaders
knew that he must be imprisoned or killed at once but knew too that he carried with him another of the para lyzing cones so that dared not rush him on the open hilltop
Neither could remain in the cabin so my only chance was to make my way to the nearest village and get help or at least gun
So slipped out rear window and got safely away without being seen by him
All of this morning it took me to get down the hill and when met you here knew should not have time to get to village as had planned but must go back and do what could myself
And now have told you all Up on that hill Powell is awaiting the second in vasion of those monsters from the atom an invasion that will annihilate our world
If we can overpower him and replace the glowing blocks around the sandgrain we shall have prevented disaster
If not But do you believe the story
Will you help me Hunter answered slowly his brain whirling from the things he had heard
Its so incredible he be gan biit the booming sounds you mentioned they heard that in Lead anfoot
It seems so queer though Suddenly he thrust hand toward Marlowe
believe you he told him
want to help The other gripped his hand silent ly then glanced up at the sun
We have perhaps four hours he said rising
Hunter too jumped to his feet and for moment they looked together up the dark sides of Ker achan Hill
Presently the two men were forg ing steadily up that hillside
They spoke little and their faces were set drawn
The sun was falling ever more swiftly toward the west and al ways their eyes measured the dist ance between that descending sun and the horizon
By the time they surmounted the first rough heights and began their progress up the thinlywooded upper half of the hill the gray veils of twi light were already obscuring the sur rounding country
Over peaks and valleys over forests and grassy fields lay strange silence ominous fore boding As they toiled up toward the summit through the thickening dusk it seemed to Hunter that the whole world was silent breathless tensely waiting WEIRD TALES omplete darkness had fallen when Marlowe turned and made cau tioning gesture
We are very near the summit now he told Hunter in whisper
For Gods sake go quietly Together they crept upward through thick underbrush and over jagged rocks until they crouched at the edge of the smooth grassy space that was the hills summit
This summit was not exactly level but sloped down from them in slight grade and at its center Hunter saw the black yawning hole Marlowe had mentioned the pit that held the sand grain
Marlowe was tugging at his sleeve
Powell down at the other edge he whispered excitedly
Glancing down to that farther edge of the summit Hunter saw there thin spare figure dimly outlined against the stars the figure of man who was gazing silently at the twinkling lights of distant village
And over to their right at the very edge of the bare summit was the rough dark mass that he knew must be the small cabin
Again Marlowe twitched his sleeve
We must rush him from both sides he told Hunter
You crawl around the right side of the summit and will take the left and when you get near enough go for him
Dont give him time to get that cone out With whispered good luck he wrung Hunters hand and began to creep stealthily around the left edge of the hilltop
His heart pounding violently Hunter crept forward on the right side toward the man at the summits edge who still stood motionless watching the distant lights
Hunter wondered where Marlowe was in the darkness
By now he was crawling past the open door of the cabin keep ing close within the shadow of the little building
From that point he could glimpse in the starlight the profile of the man they stalked
strong mad face it was with burning eyes be neath mass of gleaming irongray hair face that was turned toward the south and its distant lights as though fascinated by them
Suddenly Powell laughed and at the unexpected sound Hunter stopped short on hands and knees
bitter mocking laughter it was that sickened the listening student
As it ceased the man at the hills edge raised clenched fist and shook it at the distant lights
And his voice rang out over the silent hilltop like the note of warning bell
man take heed Even while Powell voiced that cry of hate and menace Hunter moved forward again
And at his first movement his knee pressed down on small stick that broke with the sound of pistolshot
Instantly Powell turned his hand flashing down to his pocket and emerging with small object in its grasp
As Hunter gathered himself for swift desperate spring that object glowed out tiny circle of luminous green and the young stu dent sank back to the ground de prived of all power of motion by the paralyzing cone
Powell advanced toward him holding the cone out stretched
So you escaped Marlowe he said and Hunter realized that in the darkness the man had mistaken him for his former prisoner
Powell was speaking on
think that Ill stop your interference now for good
Not that have any personal animus against you assure you but cant allow you to disrupt the plans have made As he said this mockingly he carefully placed the cone on small mound of earth so that its rays still held Hunter paralyzed
Then he THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS straightened and was reaching for the pistol at his belt when dark figure sprang from behind dashing him to earth
The thought beat through Hunt er brain as he lay unable to twitch muscle watching the combat of those two figures that reeled about striking kicking twisting
But what was that
That thin humming that suddenly made itself heard that grew to droning to rumbling reverberating thunder
Out of the pit dark shape was drifting up black disk that grew grew grew
It grew un til it had attained diameter of thir ty feet then hovered above the pit near the struggling men As he glimpsed it Marlowe cried out de spairingly and Powells mad laugh ter flung up
And now was sud den stir at the edge of the hovering disk flurry of movement there
Hunter darkly glimpsed shapes that crowded about the disks edge that peered at the struggling men
Did they mistake the two as menace to themselves did they fail to recognise Powell
For even as the two men reeled in battle toward the disk blinding shaft of blue light stabbed out from the disks edge and struck the struggling pair
Under that ray and in its light Hunter saw the faces of the two men change horribly stiff en draw crack and over him swept breath of utter cold an icy little wind that seemed to freeze his blood
An instant he saw Powell and Mar lowe thus staggering reeling fall ing then they had collapsed to shapeless heap on the ground and the blue ray striking out past them had touched the glowing cone on the little mound which instantly exploded with flash of light releasing Hunter from its prisoning power
The blue ray was sweeping in eirele about the hilltop now and with sudden frantie fear he crawled through the open door of the dark cabin crouching in comer of it fearfully
Suddenly the ray swept up to the cabin and beneath its touch the glass of the windows cracked instantly
An icy puff of air again swept over Hunter in his corner as the ray swept through the open door and hung steady for moment
Its blue light illumined little metal stove opposite the door stove that covered instantly with lime of frost and ice at the rays touch
moment the ray hung thus steadily doubtfully then abruptly vanished as though snapped out
Hunter sighed chokingly
The humming sounds began again outside and his fear mastered by curiosity he crept to the cracked window
mass of tiny black circles was rising from the pit floating up and growing at the same time while the first disk hung to one side watch ing
The black circles rose high ex panded almost instantly to the size of the first were joined by that first disk
For minute Hunter watched the disks circling above swirling about in an eddying mass
Then three de tached from those above and sank down to the hilltop hovering close above it and sweeping it ever and again with the deadly blue ray that eame and went across the cabin while he watched
The other disks more than score in number grouped in compact formation then raced swiftly south
The vanguard of the atomic con querors loosed at last upon the world of man
Tt is doubtful if we shall ever know the exact purpose of that first raid on the atomic invaders
That ques tion might be solved if we knew how much information they had received from Powell regarding our Earth
As it is we look on that first coming WEIRD TALES as an effort not so much to destroy as to disorganize to terrorize
Doubt less it was their plan to break up all chance of organized opposition in England by series of swift and deadly blows then take over the island at their leisure and make it the base of their future operations
Whatever their intentions they passed over all northern England without stopping and the world first became aware of their presence when they struck with terrific force at Manchester and Liverpool succes sively
There is no clear coherent account of their coming to Manchester
The survivors saw that hour of dread through haze of terror and it was long before all accounts were pieced together to make reasonably com plete story of the happenings there
One sees through those horrorstrick en tales terror descending without warning out of the darkness on the unsuspecting city beneath
No doubt the streets were crowded and the aters and showwindows ablaze all the life and stir of early evening
Then swift gathering of dark shapes above the deadly blue ray Hashing down on the streets searing in icy path of death across the city
It must have been utterly incom prehensible destruction to those be low
Even now we scarcely under stand the nature of that blue ray the Cold Ray as it is now called We know that all things in its path act ed as if under the influence of ex treme unheardof cold absolute ero
It was exactly as if the inva ders had concentrated utter cold and burled it forth in single stabbing ray
Strictly speaking of course there is no such thing as positive old only absence of heat
The heory generally accepted now is that in some unexplained manner the ray bad the power of instantly sucking away the heat of anything it touched
Certain it is that the ray was terrible weapon
Beneath it flesh and blood froze immediately into black hard lumps metal cracked trees and plants shriveled instantly
It is curious to note that the action of the ray was highly localized that it could slay one man hile another man ten feet away would feel only sudden breath of intense cold
As it swept steadily along the streets of Manchester that night over taking the fleeing crowds and leav ing them in shapeless heaps it must have seemed like the very day of doom to those below
They speak of it as enduring for hours that time that the invaders hung above the city while in reality the disks re mained over Manchester somewhat less than twenty minutes
How many Avere slain in that time it is impos sible to guess
The city at least was thrown into wild intense panic and no doubt that was the purpose of the invaders
That accomplished they gathered together and sped away to the west to Liverpool
The story of the massacre at Liver pool is almost identical with that at Manchester
There too the disks struck down with icy death at the city but one curious feature differ entiates the Liverpool account
It seems that as the Cold Ray swept around the city it crossed ever and again the citys harbor and the sea outside
And for many days after ward immense icebergs of unprece dented size ranged the English coast born of that striking of the ocean by the blue ray
At Manchester and Liverpool and even as far south as Birmingham the invaders came down without warn ing striking unexpectedly spreading death and dread then racing away
But some time before they reached London word of the attacks on the northern cities had been received and men waited ready for battlfe so that it was over London that the atomic THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS people and the forces of man clashed for the first time
It was the assumption of the War Office in London that Manchester and Liverpool had been attacked by the airplanes of some continental power without the formality of declaration of war
Certainly they did not dream of the real nature of the menace that was speeding to ward them
Presently from all the airsta tions around the city plane after plane was spiraling up while in great ring around London the giant searchlights stabbed the night sweep ing the sky in search of the in vaders
Even while the planes as cended and hung in thin line high above the eity thunder was growl ing low and ominous and lightning flickering across the sky
It was with this gathering storm that the disks raced down toward the city never glimpsing the line of planes above
For space of min utes they hung motionless surveying the shining splendid metropolis
The streets below temporarily deserted beneath the coming storm were like brilliant rivers of light connecting the lakes of luminescence that were the squares
One imagines the in vaders in the disks staring down at the city in amazement if their rep tilian natures possessed the power
As they hung there the beam of one of the questing searchlights caught them and held them and the stabbing rays of the other lights shifted to them at once bathing the disks in flood of white light
Then from high above the airplanes drove down upon them and the battle had be gun
One can see that battle clearest perhaps through the eyes of single individual certain young Brown ell who was the pilot of singleseat er combat plane
At the first orders he had taken the air almost joyously with the exciting thought that at last his training was to be tested in actual battle
He thrilled to the thought as with the other planes he swooped down upon the disks
Down he went and down diving toward single disk that hung at some distance from the mass of its fellows
His hands grasped the con trol of the planes machinegun and even above the roar of the motor he heard the puppuppuppup of the gun spraying bullets on the disk
He swept down onto that disk and over it in great curve passing above it at height of few yards
As he flashed over it the lightning flared out blindingly above and as he caught momentary sight of the things on the disk his hands trembled on the con trols
He had glimpsed mass of up turned heads scaled and peaked with fanged and gaping mouths
For the first time he saw the creatures of dread he was fighting
As he drove up above the battle and banked and circled for another swoop his hands were still trembling
From below came the popping of bombs few of which scored hits on the disks most of which plunged down toward the city below misses
The roar of their detonation seemed feeble beside the crash of the thun der which was now rumbling forth almost continuously
Away to the left of the battle two planes collided and dropped swiftly to earth trail ing long streamers of red flames blazing comets plunging earthward through the upper darkness
And now their first shock of sur prize over the invaders struck back and the blue ray flashed up search ing out and finding the planes whose wings shriveled and collapsed beneath its touch
Two of the disks had been forced down by lucky hits with bombs but the others were al most unscathed and now the planes were falling ever more rapidly be neath the Cold Ray
WEIRD TALES Suddenly from high above single plane rushed down toward the massed disks in dizzying nose dive
The blue ray stabbed up from dozen disks to meet it but it plunged on smashed down into one of the disks and plane and disk whirled together down to earth the latter spilling out mass of grotesque figures that raced it in its fall
Brownell shouted hoarsely as he saw
From all around planes were diving down now smashing squarely into the disks and falling with them deliberate heroic suicide on the part of their pilots
An immense exalta tion ran through Brownell that vast forceful rapture of heroism that can sweep men up to titanic heights
He circled again then dipped the planes nose sharply and rushed down upon single disk like falling plummet
Puppuppup at the last mment he clung to the guncontrol
Rush of wind past him flash of lights roaring in his ears the disk was nearer rushing swiftly up to him nearer nearer crash
Then plane and disk were tumbling down to earth together speeding down to the brilliant streets below crashing down near the docks where something in the wrecked disk ex ploded with stunning force
Above the battle was all but fin ished
Only few of the planes re mained and the blue ray was search ing these out one by one
Present ly the invaders held the air alone nine disks remaining of the twenty or more that had begun the attack
The city below was at their mercy but they did not heed it
Circling and forming they massed again to gether then moved away to the north seemingly daunted by the fierce and unexpected resistance they had met
They had conquered but at price that disinclined them for further battle at that time
The people in the city below waited tensely but no more aerial wrecks whirled down upon them
And the everquesting searchlights revealed no sign of plane or disk over the city
Through all London reigned deathlike silence that first moment of astounded silence before the hoarse roar of fear and rage that would roll through the city
Only the deep rumble of thunder broke the stillness
Across the sky the lightning flared again once twice
Then down upon the city swept the lashing flooding rain
is to young Hunters story that one must turn again for an ac count of the invaders movements after that first raid
Crouched by the window he saw them return ing from the battle nine scarred disks returning where more than score had gone out
For the first time it struck him that possibly the forces of man might have checked the first rush of the invaders
He wondered intensely as to that
During all of that period of hours while the disks had been fighting and killing and terrorizing England he had not dared to escape from the cab in for the three guardian disks still hung very low above the hilltop and the blue ray constantly swept about that summit marking path of death
The guardians were taking no chances of anyone tampering with the sandgrain of doing harm to their own world that lay within that grain
And now when the defeated nine returned he saw that his chances of escape were even less
For except for one disk that dropped down into the pit dwindling and vanishing these returned disks took up posi tion with the watchful three hover ing low over the hilltop
Now and then one would sweep up into the sky cixcle for time then return to its position over the summit of Kei achan
THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS Hunter wondered intensely what the mission of the disk that returned into the sandgrain had been
call for aid for reinforcements
The waiting attitude of the others seemed to indicate that
Dawn had come and with its gray light he moved silently about the little cabin finding food in plenty and bolting hasty uncooked meal then returning to his position of observation by the win dow
All over the world that day was wonder
The news of the battle over London of the death that smote the northern cities had flashed out over all the Earth bringing surprize and doubt and fear to cities far away
wave of terror rolled over the British Isles and already the Channel was crowded with the shipping that bore away the first great crowds of the im pending exodus
The theory of attack by foreign power had collapsed and as men ex amined the crushed mangled bodies found in the wreckage of the disks at London they realized that Earth was invaded by creatures wholly diffeient from man but superior in power
It was but natural that they should con ceive these invaders as arriving from another planet and that was the theory held by all
In every mind was the thought that the invaders had retired only tem porarily that they would return to spread terror and death again
The disks had been discovered hovering watchfully over Kerachan Hill and from all the country about that hill the inhabitants poured forth chok ing the roads in their frantic haste to escape from the vicinity
By eve ning of that day less than twenty four hours after the first coming of the disks it is doubtful if single liv ing person with the exception of Hunter remained within ten miles of the hill
It strikes one as curious that the invaders during all that day made no effort to destroy or kill in that vicinity
They simply hung above the hill hovering and circling rest lessly waiting as it seemed to Hunt er
Waiting he thought for the re turn of the messenger who had gone back down into the atomic world
Once only they struck late in the day
force of field artillery had been ordered down from Glasgow with orders to shell the hill that was evidently the base of the invaders
Men and guns and horses rattled south along the rough road under the hot afternoon sun
High above them black speck suddenly ap peared in the blue the shape of watching disk that swept down to in vestigate
few ineffectual rifle shots were fired as the disk sank down toward them then there was bolting of men into the neighboring fields and hedges plunging of panicmaddened horses as the dark shape loomed above
Then the frosty blue Cold Ray springing down from the disk leaping swiftly along the road in trail of icy death pursuing and exterminating the running men in the fields
moment the disk hov ered and turned then swept swiftly back up into the blue
No man in that battery returned to Glasgow to report its fate and when three planes were ordered south to investigate none returned
There after no more such futile attempts were made
That night there was utter dark ness in every city in England for strict orders were given and enforced that no spark of light should betray citys presence to the invaders
But though in all England Europe America anxious people waited through the night for news of an other attack the disks of the in vaders still hovered above Kerachan Hill waiting waiting
In southern England masses of air craft collected the combined air power of England and France await WEIRD TALES ing the invaders return
And through the English roads meeting and passing the seabound masses of refugees rolled the tanks the guns the long brown masses of marching soldiers
Mankind was gathering itself for the straggle but through all those masses ran an unspoken thought an unvoiced fear
What avail were rifles and bombs against the smiting ray
Or airplanes and dirgibles against the swift and mighty disks
On hilltop miles away from Ker aehan men lay hidden with pow erful telescopes and radiotransmit ters ready to flash word of the in vaders movements to all the Earth
And all the Earth waited tensely for that word ondering hoping fear ing
The bright morning of that day passed the second since the first night raid of the invaders And all through that morning no word came from the hidden watchers
Two hours of the afternoon had passed when message finally came short concise
It said only Disks are gathering in immense force above Kerachan Hill and are evidently pre paring to move That message short as it was was sufficient to cause the last stable forms of life in England to break up melt away
Those crowds of people who had remained hoping against hope now fought their way madly toward the seacoast to escape to life
Over those fleeing hordes ran shout threat warning
They are coming They called it to one another autos racing through country villages shouted it the mobs on the roads voiced it fearfully soldiers resting by the wayside repeated it thoughtfully looking toward the north
Over England over Europe over the whole world it ran swiftly terribly They are coming
They arc coming
ND now the last great hour of Earths destiny was swiftly clos ing down with that massing of the invaders above the Scottish hills
Crouched beside the window of the cabin Hunter watched them pouring up from the pit from their atomic world masses of tiny disks that grew with inconceivable speed to full size that moved away and made room for the others to rise
Up up up gigan tic masses of the disks countless hordes of the monsters they held vast force of invaders before which all human resistance would be vain he knew
After that night of the invaders first attack on Earth that night of his imprisoning in the cabin he had watched through day and another night and now well into this day ex cept for few hours of sleep that he had snatched
Watching waiting fearful of the everpresent guardian disks above like them waiting wait ing
And now this flood of the disks this upspringing of all their mighty forces
As he gazed at them now floating up from the pit in dark end less masses it seemed to him that the malignant spirit of Powell laughed again beside him
The rum bling thunder of the expanding disks seemed to him like the sound of mighty bell tolling the end of the reign of man
He glanced up saw the hundreds of disks above spreading out in long double line in an irresistible forma tion awaiting the others that were still rising from the pit
But as Hunter watched them circling and forming above the sky seemed to darken suddenly the sunlight to be cut off to vanish
And along the line of invaders above ran quick start sudden nervous shock
Darker and darker grew the sky Continued on page Vhe BRIMS ELLEN NE CAT For this piece of work you are no longer hangman and jailer said Queen Elizabeth and there was in dignation in her voice
rom my earliest memory as small child have hated cats
They fill me with an indescrib able feeling of dread and horror that amotmts almost to an illness in their presence
Snakes can bear and of all other animals am fond but eats to me are creatures most loathsome
Mrs Flynn my landlady has gray cat with yellow spot on its head as though the devil had brand ed his servant with brimstone before sending it into the world
Such has always been my fancy of Mrs Flynn cat
But then am queer
My friends certain of them apologize for me as queer
have some fame as writer of stories and they forgive me my queerness on that score
My name is Govern Ariste queer name
have queer fancies and number among my friends those friends who do not apologize for me queer people
Such friend is Amir Das who does not laugh at my hatred of cats nor think me queer because of it
For everything in the world my friend there is reason this Amir Das who is Hindoo philosopher has often told me
Tonight we discussed the matter again over our tea
Amir Das it should be mentioned is graduate of Oxford where he acquired an English fondness for afternoon tea
When he appears at my rooms before oclock of an afternoon and this is the time he most often chooses for his visits it is Mrs OFlynn her self who steps in and brews the cheer ing beverage for us after the man ner that only one brought up in the ould counthry can
As have said the Hindoo con tinued for everything in this world or any other world there is reason
That is the law of all nature
For WEIRD TALES every cause there is an effect
For every effect there has been cause
place my hand in that fire which flames on your hearth
It burns me and take my hand away
Never will put my hand in fire again
It has hurt me and fear it
Cause has produced effect Do we desire knowledge
We must ever seek to know the causes of the effects we see
Now this fear this horror you have for cats when you were baby small child perhaps cat fright ened you My mother says not but that cried at sight of one even before could talk told him
And she had always loved cats
She had five of the animals as pets at the time of my birth but even as baby showed such signs of fright at them she gave them every one away
We never had cat afterward and my dislike of the creatures continued as grew older
Then my friend your feeling for these animals is the unconscious remembrance of another life
Some time somewhere misfortune came to you in the guise of cat
We people of the East know these things to be true
But you of the West with your numerous schools and your much education laugh at the thought that the soul may live through many lives coming into different bodies and acting different dramas but learning each time little bit more of that which it has willed to learn and working all these experiences into one perfect plot in the end
You laugh although daily you see about you proof of the truth of these things which my people have taught and known for ages
man is introduced to maiden and with the meeting of their eyes he knows that she is the one among all others for whom he has been seeking
And she too meeting his ardent glance for the soul looks out through the eyes knows that he is the man of her heart
Recognition leaps like flash of electric flame between them
You of the West term it love at first sight but we of the East say love not at first sight but love for each other many times in many lives has been the joy of that man and that maid And insofar as they have loved truly in the past they seek for and find the beloved again
Does not your Scripture say Love is stronger than the grave
Then have not met the one loved in the past told him
Many lives must have loved my self alone for have always been content to be bachelor and no wo man has ever appeared to me as de sirable above all other women
But we were speaking of cats not love my friend We speak of reincarnation the chapters of life replied the Hindoo
And your hatred of cats Ariste is doubtless part of chapter now past chapter perhaps you are happier for not remembering
After some further talk of the same nature but more deeply philo sophical Amir Das left me to ponder his statements in the cozy firelight of the oldfashioned fireplace
This fireplace together with Mrs Flynns teamaking abilities has kept me for many months content ed lodger in the warmhearted Irish womans house in spite of the de testable cat that she insists on keep ing
The fiendish voice of this cat now heard wailing from distant part of the house
presumed that probably it had been locked into some room as it accompanied Mrs OFlynn prowling shadow on one of her busy housewifely rounds
watched the red fire on the hearth and thought of what my Hin doo friend had said
thought of THE BRIMSTONE CAT love and of eats and holding my mind stilled while looked at the dancing flames tried to bring out of my memory some reason for my hatred of eats
must have dozed for started up from my seat confused and some what dazed
As one who recalls the dim memories of dream remem bered that was Govern Ariste writer of stories who lived in The memory of dreams dims as one wakes and so did the memory of Gov ern Ariste slip into the inaccessible places of my consciousness
But what matter
Peter By field poor young student in London Town had long been given to dream ing
laughed at myself somewhat grimly to find that had been enter taining but one more fantastic fancy
didst thou not dream so mueh more wouldst thou accom plish scoffed to myself
Having lived for many years alone had acquired the habit of lonesome peo ple who talk with themselves in lieu of better or worse company
The fire on the hearth was almost dead and stooped to place upon it another fagot
Then looked at the small pile of unbumed fagots by the hearthside wondering how long they would last to keep some of the chill of London rain and fog out of my attic room
More fagots meant mon ey of which had but little store
The hearth was of roughly cut stone and the attic room was humbly furnished with eot and chair and in one corner table on which were strange crucibles and retorts and above it shelf whereon were books and manuscripts
But however hum ble my room it contained all the mysteries of life for me save only one
That one had met some days past in the queens hunting park where unlawfully sought for herbs and rocks that would help me in my stud ies of alchemy
had come upon this arch mystery of all in an open space between the trees dismounted beside her horse
In her hands she nursed falcon with broken wing
She was tiny thing with red gold curls and in one cheek was dimple that man might not look upon overlong without mad desire to kiss it
who shoxdd have fled because broke the law by being in this place at all stood transfixed looking with heart and eyes at the vision before me
Then the maiden turned raising her gaze to mine and saw that her eyes were of blue like that of the sea on calm summer afternoon
But more had they than color
They gave the man that looked into them feeling of rest and harbor such as voyager might have when after long and eary journey to many ports he comes at last home
As looked into her eyes and she into mine knew not only that this was the most beautiful woman had ever seen but that she was my true love and that could never care for any other
forgot that although ambitious and the son of noble father was but poor student who might scarcely dare to love high lady such as her appearance pro claimed her to be
True my studies were of alchemy and should find the philosopher stone in which men of that day be lieved and foi which they spent long years of study and search would have all power at my command
My father had been noble of Henry Ills couit but had dis pleased the king and been forced to fine England
An adventurer he had journeyed in many far countries where he had studied strange sci ences with stranger teachers among them the Moorish teachers of Araby WEIRD TALES In one of these foreign lands knew knew not where nor of what mother had been bom
And he had brought back to Eng land with him in his old age along with the small boy that was marvelous collection of books and manuscripts
Some of these he had taught me to read
For others he had given me clue to the inner meaning they contained
And for all he had inspired in me the thirst to understand thirst that had contin ued with me unquenched after his death several years previously
Something knew of the philoso phers stone by which base metal such as lead might be transmuted to gold and by which old men had their old age renewed as youth
And for this philosophers stone became one of the searchers hoping with my experiments and the knowledge contained in my precious books that might some day find the miracle working talisman
Thus had my room with its crucibles retorts books and potions among which daily experimented contained all the
mysteries of life for me until the day met in the royal park the Lady Edith Estes attend ant to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
Then had Peter By field taken back to my attic with the injured fal con whose wing had promised to try to cure the greatest and sweetest mystery of all mystery that pulsed in my heart like song and that brought between my eyes and the books would fain have studied vi sions of golden curls magic dimple and eyes like blue pooli
of heaven
The last mystery bid fair to put to rout and take the place of all the other mysteries whose solution had so long sought
In my study of alchemy do not boast but say truly had learned more of physic than many physicians of my time
It thus happened that on the day awoke from my strange dream of life in which my name was Govern Ariste found the injured falcon apparently recov ered
With all the skill that possessed had wound strips of cloth to bind the wing to the birds body until the broken bones could grow together again
had kept the restless falcon quiet by having it hooded all that time
Now removed the hood and the bird flew about my room with wing but slightly stiff
had made good my promise to the Lady Estes that could cure her pet
Exultant that had served my be loved in even so small thing caught the bird hooded it again and chained it to my wrist
Then went forth to seek its mistress
She had told me that could ask for certain servant at the palace who in turn would call her
This did and shortly found myself again in that radiant presence
Doffing my cap bowed low in the fashion of courtier
My tongue false friend had left me
As at that other meeting in the park could say but few stiff words the while told her of how it had been my great pleasure to cure so fine bird
She had purse in her hand but my courtly manner must have made her know that was no hireling to be paid with gift of money
In stead she gave me more precious gift the memory of her smile as she thanked me with gracious words
And having reflected well on the difference in station between great court lady and poor student hastened to excuse myself lest for get and throwing myself at her feet declare the passion felt
Neither at the time she had found me in the park nor now did she make reference to the fact that it had been unlawful for me to wander in the royal hunting preserves
But any fear might have had that THE BRIMSTONE CAT she would make known her discovery of my presence there had been for gotten from the first glimpse of her
Even prison or punishment were well worth enduring for the Xapture that had become mine
So mused as turned my steps from the palace toward the poor tenement that held my attic room
In such frame of mind it was that came upon young Tom Smythe the jailers son and the cat that he tortured as sport for his companions
It was gray cat which later dis covered had sulfurcolored patch upon its head
But at the time saw only the manner in which young Tom had tied the animal stretched out on its back with its four feet drawn by cords to four stakes so that the boy might draw and quarter it even as his father Tom the hangman had that day executed poor wretch sentenced to be drawn and quartered for treason to the crown
Around young Tom had gathered crowd of admiring youngsters
Tom with knife who knows where small boys obtain the instruments for their devilments
had raised his arm for the first stroke that would slit the cats body lengthwise
Mean while the animal yowled in an agony that but added to the glee of the spectators
Surely the memory of Govern Ariste was far from the thought of Peter Byfield for Peter Byfield on that day did not hate eats
loved them as did all other ani mals and the sight of the tormented creature before me filled me with great pity and great rage at the young fiend who had undertaken this cruelty
With two strides had parted the surprized children and seized the knife from the wouldbe executioner
Four strokes made with it at the binding ropes and the gray cat with yellow spot upon its head bounded from the earth as only frightened cat can and hisked up the roof of the nearest house to live eight more lives fate favoring
Even then all might have been well had not the rage of my heart demanded vengeance upon the per son of the young rascal
The boy was bully the leader of all the lads of the neighborhood but now hum bled him before the eyes of his frightened playmates
Right lustily laid onto him holding him across my knee with one hand and applying stout strokes with the other until he wailed as loud as the cat had done
Nor did heed nor care that black hatred was born in the blubbering bullys mind when finally released him
With short words told him what measures would take should again find him illtreating cat or any other animal
Then wearied and my thoughts once more turning to the vision of the Lady Edith Estes sought my lodg ing determined to work with re newed effort in my search for the philosophers stone that meant wealth and fame and perchance the win ning of my love
Late that night worked measur ing and mixing new potions that might lead me to the elixir of life
As bent to my task was startled by wailing cry from the roof of an adjoining house upon which my attic window looked out
opened the window and cat sprang into the room
It was gray cat with yellow spot upon its head most vile and draggledappearing eat and it cried to me with plaintive insistence which bespoke its opinion that life saved even cats life as worth little unless that life might have food and shelter
gave the beast some of the gruel and milk that formed my simple sup per
It ate and curled up on the hearth purring and content
WEIRD TALES Such was the manner in which Peter Byfield came to make com panion and pet of the gray cat
the day and age when Peter By field rescued the gray eat men held many superstitions
It was not well even in that England which was then coming to birth as great na tion and which allowed more freedom of thought and action to its inhab itants than any other country for man to be too markedly different from his neighbors
Those who stud ied alchemy might well be careful that they be not accused in the popu lar mind as pursuing other and un sanctified studies
Young Tom Smythe whom Peter Byfield held over his knee and beat on the day the youth tried to draw and quarter the gray cat chanced to fall ill of colic the week after that episode
Young Tom had told his father who was the chief hang man of London Town of the treat ment accorded him by the alchemist
The elder Tom although brutal evil fellow who could and
did on occasion beat his son most cruelly yet in this case resented the fact that stranger had taken upon himself this parental task
He resented furthermore that the stranger had done this for so simple cause as anger at the innocent boyish sport of executing stray cat
Tom the eld er when he heard the story cursed that stranger and swore that he would have revenge upon him
When young Tom fell ill after he had feasted uninvited of green apples stolen from private garden an ugly thought raised itself in the brain of his father
Young Tom it may be said had told no one of the green apples
Only few days before it had been the hangmans pleasant duty to officiate at the last events in the life of poor old woman accused by her neighbors of witchcraft and of caus ing sickness among some children in her neighboihood
The wretched creature had been tried tortured and confessing under the torture had been condemned to die as witch
Tom senior had carried out the tor ture which had made the victim ad mit her guilt and it had fallen to him nothing loth to tie the frantic woman to the stake and pile and light the fagots that destroyed her body and presumably carried her soul back to its master in his flaming pit
Now cunning train of thought built itself up in Toms mind
man of more or less mystery stu dent of strange things whom all his neighbors knew to spend long hours in brewing unknown compounds for what devilish purpose no one knew had recently shown anger against the hangmans child
More he had beat en that child and threatened him and the lad had fallen ill shortly afterward
This surely as the working of sorcery and the deed of one who had sold himself to the devil
To verify his suspicions the elder Tom who lived not far from the lodging of Peter Byfield made inquiry among the neighbors of the alchemist nor as he adverse to starting strange rumors about the student
Then it was that those who knew the alchemist began to spread queer tales of the man
They recalled that this Peter Byfield spent much time alone in his attic room to which he seldom if ever invited guests
It was rumored that the room contained strange things crucibles retorts and drugs all the paraphernalia for making witch brew
They remembered that the alchem ist had never been overneighborly although he had been known to do such deeds of charity as to give bread to the hungry
lie had even be stowed money on those in need
THE BRIMSTONE CAT Doubtless man who was the ser vant of Satan could easily make bread by black magic or even produce money by his sorcery
It was known that he had magically cured falcon with broken wing which he had been seen bringing home one day al most dead and had later taken away with him apparently sound
Those whom Peter Byfield had helped in their need now began to pray God that they had not taken aid from servant of the devil or having done so innocently that this would not be accounted sin to them
They began to watch this man of mystery
And then it was that they discovered damning and erowning proof of their suspicions
Peter Byfield it was learned had as companion cat gray cat with yellow spot upon its head verily the cat that the alchemist had rescued from the hands of young Tom Smythe
This solved the matter completely and made the evidence conclusive
Why else would man take pains to save eat from death were that cat not his familiar his demon compan ion
Tom the elder sought the judge friend of his to whom he told his suspicions and the hearsay evidence he had gathered
Of all these things meanwhile was Peter Byfield happily ignorant
But the young alchemist undertook more diligently than ever the studies that he sought to master spurred on by the vision in his lonesome young heart the vision of the beautiful Lady Edith Estes
nd so it chanced on day not more than two weeks after the day on which rescued the cat that Peter Byfield unaware of the evil plotted against me by the hangman had my experiments rudely inter rupted by the entrance into my attic room of four armed men of the law
Without ceremony found myself arrested and carried to jail accused of one of the most serious charges of the day witchcraft
The gray cat reposing before my hearth in all the purring content of wellfed animal was taken as proof against me
Tom the elder who was among the men that arrest ed me had cunningly provided sack for the cat and it had been the triumph of young Tom now some what recovered from his sickness to capture the animal and throw it into the bag
found myself in dark dungeon and in most perilous position for of all the crimes at that time recognized by law witchcraft was accounted es pecially heinous and had as its pun ishment the most terrible forms of death
Likewise it was the most difficult charge of all from which man could vindicate himself man un der suspicion of being sorcerer might be and was tortured in the most brutal manner to obtain con fession
If he did not confess he laid himself liable to conviction for that verv reason as being protected by his master the devil
The law dealt hardly with persons accused of witchcraft all of which knew
Even the image of the maid with the blue eyes the golden curls and kissinviting dimple faded from my thoughts though still held deep in my heart as the realization of my plight came upon me
My fears were wellfounded
When refused to acknowledge guilt of the crime of which was accused the ignorant cruel judge urged on by the brutal hangman ordered me to be tortured until should confess such guilt
First they pricked me with needles to find if had on me anywhere the invulnerable spot
This was the spot WEIRD TALES supposed to be without feeling where had been sealed by my master the devil
When this torture failed my flesh ever quivering at the needles thrust they put me on the rack
However Peter Byfield used the strength of my will and refused to confess myself guilty of that of which was inno cent
denied that the sickness of young Tom had been the result of any evil work on my part
admitted that was student of alchemy seeking the philosophers stone
But maintained that sought this stone not for myself alone but for the good might do with it to mankind
As proof of my honest intention pointed out the charitable deeds had done to those in need
My rescue of the gray cat explained had been because of my love for dumb creatures
But judge and accusers who could authorize and witness such tor ture of human being as the torture to which was put could not under stand one whose plea was that he had saved an animal from suffering
They gave me respite from the rack and sought other means of mak ing me confess
And then it was that the genius of Tom the hangman invented torture more diabolical than Satan himself it would seem could have devised
Toms attention had been called to the sack which held the gray cat by continued and frenzied caterwaul ings on the part of that animal which the jailers brutal kicks did not still
Putting his hand within the sack he sought to bring forth my companion in guilt and misery
The cat had sharp claws and Tom had been well scratched before he finally gave up the attempt and re tied the creature in the bag
Then there had flashed into his mind the fiendish scheme for an excruciating torture on me the cats master Peter Byfield and the gray cat should be tied into sack as fellows
So might this sorcerers own familiar spirit of evil be used to bring about the mans ruin
Tom told his plan to the judge who immediately saw its possibilities and ordered its exe cution
Thus found myself stripped and tied from the neck down in huge sack and with me as companion the gray cat crazed and frantic now ready to claw its erstwhile master as though indeed it were demon
This sack was then tied by ropes to posts so that it hung hammockfash ion while Tom the hangman swung it turning me first face down and then on my back as he prodded the cat with rod to keep it ever moving in its clawing frenzy
Horror of horrors beyond the pow er of words to tell
The agony of that torture
The screaming pain as the sharp claws tore my body al ready so brutally tortured and racked
The human body can stand much but the human nerves have limit of endurance
And as Peter Byfield had sensitiveness of nerves ahead of my day
Otherwise would not have had the sympathy that had made me stoop to free tormented cat in the streets
The tearing of that cats claws on my bare body was now the most frightful torture that human say rather satanical ingenuity could have devised
By will almost more than human fought with myself that should not confess to crime had not committed
Then did beg of my torturers that they put me to death for death even death by the fire and stake appeared to me as haven of rest and peace
And at last finding that would not confess they freed me from the sack
The judge was loth to condemn without confession but since it ap peared that this could not be ob THE BRIMSTONE CAT tained lie deliberated weightily and finally gave it as his opinion that there was sufficient criminal evidence for conviction
The very fact that had not con fessed the judge averred was due to the hardening of my heart and will through strength given me in my hour of trial by my unholy master
So upon me he pronounced sen tence that should on the following day at high noon lie burned at the stake as warning to other witches wizards and sorcerers
With me condemned to share my fate was the gray eat
The judge had noted the yellow spot on the creatures head and with the logie of the day had made it another link in the chain of evidence that led to my undoing
This yellow spot was doubtless smokespot of brimstone said the judge which had left its mark upon the cat when the creature came from the bottomless pit
Fitting indeed that the flames should return it thither
heard my death sentence as boon granted in mercy by heaven
Then was taken back to my rude dungeon to suffer night of pain from my broken and bleeding body and from my heart which said that never again should stand in the bright glory of May morning and see her as had first seen her the fair dear lady of my heart
was gray tomorrow that fol lowed that gray day of torture
As noon approached was led to the place of execution public square Avhile ribald crowd followed and hooted me adjuring me to call upon my master the devil to save me from death
Tom the hangman as to have his final triumph for he it was who chained me to the iron stake
At my feet he tethered by another chain the brimstonespotted cat now somewhat subdued by torment
High about us he piled fagots and then everything being ready approached with his lighted torch while on his surly face was the smile of fiend
Grimly shut my eyes and prayed to the God of love in whom had be lieved until that yesterday of torture that he might give me strength to die as befitted the son of noble father
Surely the hangman had lighted the fagots by now or was he holding baek to prolong my agony
waited to feel the breath of the flame
Al most thought my body would not shrink from its warm embrace but would welcome its fiery kiss of death as setting free soul prisoned in body that had been dungeon of terrors
And then perchance it were delusion born of my weakness and pain heard voice speak staying my executioner
It was voice with clear sweet tone such voiee as an angel might have but in it was command that would not be denied
it commanded
What is this you do and hy is this poor man so condemned
The gruff voiee of the hangman answered
He is wizard your ladyship
He cast spell upon my child who would have perished of strange sickness had we not found this man and put him here where shortly the flames will take him back to his mas ter Satan and his vile cat with him Is there cat asked the voiee
Let me see this animal Tis beneath the fagots your ladyship
would see it say There was rustle as Tom moved the fagots and perceiving that this must be more than delusion opened my eyes to see what person had dared interfere with the course of the law and whom it was the hangman obeyed
WEIRD TALES gazed into the face of an angel indeed
Little she was with redgold curls and dimple in one cheek that man might not look upon without mad desire to kiss it
And her eyes in the blue of them like the blue of the sea on calm summer afternoon there was rest and harbor for mans soul
But more than that there was such flame of pity and indignation that knew what had almost doubted that God of love still reigned in dark age and that there was one human being in the world besides myself who would under stand the kindness had done cat
To the lady of the curls and eyes of blue Tom the langman held out the cat the while telling the story of Peter Byfield wizard and his famil iar who possessed this animal
The lady listened looking at the condemned man but the horror that showed in her face at the recital was at the hangmans story of Peter Byfields sufferings rather than horror of the sorcerer himself
Then strange thing happened
The girl stretched forth her hand as though she would pet the cat and when the jailer would have remon strated commanded him haughtily and took the halfdead animal in her hands
As if by magic the tormented beast ceased its struggles and raising its head sought with evident fondness for the stroking caress of her fingers
Another voice deep mellow voice albeit that of woman spoke
Be careful my Lady Edith it chided or this hangman will accuse you also of witchcraft when you so easily charm Satans servants Do you look Your Majesty re plied the girl
It is the cat that we rescued in the Royal Park half year
here is the brown spot upon its head
Remember you not how the dogs had the animal at bay and how it turned and faced them so pluckily
You and the Earl of Leicester and came upon them and the earl made quip of the fact that this cat wore upon its head hair of the color of Your Majestys hair that denotes in its possessor uncon querable spirit as Spanish galleons so lately sunk off our coasts bear witness for Englands unconquerable queen do remember the happening replied the second voice
You took the cat and made of it your pet but it has been lost some days now as you say
With effort turned my eyes for minute from the fair face that held them so adoringly enthralled
Then saw that the other speaker was woman of most royal presence No need to note the color of the hair which Englands virgin queen had made the fashion of court ladies no need to hear the tiny ladyinwaiting address her as Your Majesty knew that stood before Elizabeth Queen of England and that by miracle chance had opened that might give me my life
in the name of God mercy Your Majesty cried
If this be your cat then do not let them kill me for having saved its life
They accuse me as dealer in witch craft but as God is my witness have done no wrong
but saved this cat from the hands of the son of this vile hangman
The boy would have killed it most cruelly had not taken the beast from him
Of the lads illness know nothing and api guilt less Is the boy yet ill asked the queen turning to the hangman
He was most ill Your Majesty said the man somewhat sullenly though now he seems recovered
But who can say how long he may stay thus sound if he be under the spell of wizard This man is not wizard
Nor would he hurt any lad Your Majesty
THE BRIMSTONE CAT On that would pledge my soul said the Lady Edith now stepping forward
The guilty confess their crimes and he has not so done
Nay he would not said the hangman
The devil gave him strength to stand even the torture of being in the sack with the cat
Then he told them with evil glee of the fiendish torment he had de vised
The small ladyinwaiting who had since first my gaze met hers comforted me with her blue eyes of pity shuddered at the recital even more than she had before
She turned so white thought she would swoon
Your Majesty she again pleaded as the jailer finished his re cital this man could not hurt lad
He it is who healed your pet falcon of its broken wing
Do you not recall how told you of him Give us your story my man
commanded the queen
remember the falcon and chided the Lady Edith that she did not bring you to my presence for fitting reward of your skill So commanded told her all my story how had studied alchemy and physic that would teach me to heal sick bird how had rescued the cat how the animal had come to me for shelter and how Tom the hangmans son having fallen ill of colic during green apple season his father had wrongly accused me of witchcraft and evil practise against the lad
Then told her of the tortures had endured but that had not con fessed even when they put me in the sack with the cat
The Lady Edith Estes shuddered again and again during the narrative of my tortures but the queen listened quietly
However there was indig nation in her voice as she asked at the end of my story What judge condemned you
And how came he to practise on you torture not in accordance with our laws
It shall go haidly with this judge and with you too man she added addressing the hangman
For this piece of work you are no longer hangman and jailer but must earn your living by other means than such zealous practises of cruelties on gen tlemen
You are indeed gentle mans son she queried me
replied that was and told her my fathers history making much of the fact that coming back to England in the beginning of her reign he had ever been loyal
adherent of the crown As talked the Lady Edith Estes continued to pet the gray cat now quite calmed
Then she turned be seeching eyes upon the queen be seeching eyes that won from her sov ereign smile
So sweet was my lit tle lady that she might even woo favors from members of her own sex
Now it seemed that the queen had listened to her pleading and made judgment thereby
Serious and grievous wrong has been done to Peter Byfield said the queen
am convinced that he is an innocent man and therefore pardon him fully and freely
Unloose the man she commanded the hang man
Faint and weak had almost fall en when Tom sullen albeit abashed released me
soldier from the queens retinue supported me while Her Majesty commanded that be taken to the palace for treatment by her court physician
We shall make you physician to our animals she announced
And perchance if we find your story true and yourself worthy we shall restore you to your fathers rank and title
What think you of that my Lady Edith
Will that be reward sufficient for this wonderful doctor of yours of whom you have talked so much since WEIRD TALES the day he mended our falcons iving Bracing myself against my faint ness turned to make thanks to the Lady Edith who had saved my life
And saw in the blush on her cheek which had followed the queens words hope that perchance there should be even greater reward for me than the queen had mentioned
reached forward to raise the small ladys hand to my lips
It lay upon the cat that she had been pet ting
touched the animal as did so and at that touch there rose in me such an abhorrence such dread and loathing and hatred for this creature through which had suf fered so much that staggered back in my weakness
remember falling falling and then Oure and don start so Mr Ariste
but come in to clear away the tea things So spoke the voice of my landlady Mrs Flynn waking me from strange dream that Govern Ariste had had dream wherein played role under the name and being of Peter Byfield dream of such vivid ness that it did not depart as most dreams do but remained with me clear distinct in every detail
Is that your cat that is howling so Mrs Flynn
It is and it may kape on its howl ing for all of me replied my land lady
It tried to eat up me lovely new singer canary and Im locking the ungrateful baste up for lesson to it not to jump on the cages of tin dollar birds
know you dont like the animal Mr Ariste nor any eats
But its really good crayture and kills many mouse Mice are well enough but when it brings about the death of man reflected but aloud mere ly announced my intention of stroll ing forth for walk
felt that needed the calming ef fect of the cold night air
Many sto ries have written
Writing is my trade
But never before had lived my plot as had tonight
Was it merely fantastic idea for story that had come to me won dered
Or had Govern Ariste once lived in the body of Peter Byficld
Had Peter Byfield been real per son
It had been real enough ex perience those several days in the life of the young alchemist that had lived through during the halfhour between the going of Amir Das and the coming of Mrs OFlynn while Govern Ariste slept in his chair be fore the open fire and Mrs Flynn gray cat yowled its penance for the attempted massacre of tindollar canary
What tale it would make
But must turn it over in my mind and clear my thoughts
walked down the hall and stepped outside closing the door on last despairing ail from the imprisoned cat
The thought eame to me that might be losing my mind
People sometimes did
Perhaps was hav ing hallucinations or it might be that my friend Amir Das had hypnotized me and sent me this dream to make me believe his strange theories of re incarnation
Such was my thought as walked knew not where
Suddenly my rev ery was broken by womans shrill scream
paused and looked up side street whence the cry seemed to come
There was the sound of running steps and girl flung herself upon me almost into my arms
Help me
help me she cried
Behind her came two men of rough appearance
am not tall and suppose did not look formidable
The men did not stop but continued Continued on page Jdh Martin Leahy The Story So Far ilton Rhodes and his friend Bill Carter go to Mount Rainier to find out what caused the dreadful murders that are supposed to have been committed by frightful Demon in custody of an Angel so they are described by those who saw them
Rhodes suddenly disappears when he and Carter are among the Tamahnowis Rocks and Carter is startled by fearful scream that seems to issue from the very heart of the rock
CHAPTER THE ANGEL HE scream ceased as suddenly as it had come
drew my re volver snapped on the elec tric light and stooping low looked into that spot where few moments before Milton Rhodes had so sudden ly and mysteriously disappeared
Nothing but the unbroken rock be fore me
And yet Rhodes had van ished
turned the light full upon the low roof and then exclaimed aloud the entrance was there
dropped to my hands and knees and moved under the pack not lit tle impeding my movements
An instant and was standing upright peering into high narrow tunnel which some convulsion of nature in some lost age of the earth had rent right through the living rock
WEIRD TALES Nothing was to be seen save the broken walls floor and roof deep eery shadows crawling and gliding as the light moved
The view however was very restricted one for the gal lery which sloped gently upward gave sudden turn at distance of only thirty feet or so
What await ed me somewhere beyond that turn
For few moments listened in tently
Not the faintest sound nothing but the loud beating of my heart
What had happened to Rhodes
Milton called softly
Oh Milton No answer came
grasped projection of rock drew myself up into the tunnel and advanced as rapidly and silently as possible the light and the alpenstock in my left hand the revolver in the right
But it was not very silently what with the creepers
At times they grated harshly it was as if spirit things were mocking me with suppressed demoniacal laughter
Yet could not pause to remove those grating shoes of toothed steel
Every second might be precious now
drew near the turn the revolver thrust forward in readiness for in stant action
reached it and there just beyond dark figure was stand ing framed in blaze of light
It was Milton Rhodes
He turned his head and saw smile move athwart his features
Well weve found it Bill
said be
was now drawing near to him
That scream
Who gave that terrible scream Terrible
It didnt sound ter rible to me said Milton Rhodes
Fact is Bill Id like to hear it again
What on earth are you talking about Tis so Who was it
Or what was it Why the angel he told me
Where is she now Gone Bill shes gone
When she saw me she fetched up gave that scream then turned and vanished around that next turn What was she like Milton wish could tell you
But how can man describe Venus
know one thing Bill if all the daughters of Drome are as fair as this one that saw know where all the movie queens of the future are coming from
looked at him and laughed
Wait till you see her Bill
Com plexion like alabaster white as Rain ier purest snow
And hair
Oh that hair Bill
Like ten billion dollars worth of spun gold And the demon queried
didnt see any demon Bill There was silence for little space
Then said the whole thing is true after all You mean what Grandfather Scranton set down in his journal and the rest of it nodded
never doubted that At times told him didnt doubt it
Then again it all seemed so wild and weird that didnt know what on earth to think think he said with wan smile that you know what to think now now when you are standing in this very way to Drome whatever Drome may be Yes
And yet the thing is so strange
Think of it
world of which men have never dreamed save in the wildest romance
An under ground world
Subterranean ways subterranean cities men and women there Cavernicolous Aphrodites said Milton Rhodes
And all down there in eternal darkness exclaimed
Why the thing is incredible
No wonder that sometimes find myself wondering if am not in dream
DROME Said Milton Rhodes All that we see or seem Is but dream within dream
But come Bill he added dont let this priori stuff bowl you over
In the first place it isnt ark down there when you get down far enough In heavens name how do you know that
Why for one thing if this sub terranean world was one of unbroken darkness the angel and the demon would be blind like those fishes in the Mammoth Cave
But she is no more blind than you or Ergo if for no other reason we shall find light down there Of course they have artificial light or dont mean that
If there had not been some other illumination this strange race of whose very ex istence science has never even dreamed would have ceased to exist long ago if indeed it ever could have begun But no gleam of sunlight can ev er find its way to that world
It never can of course
But there are other sources of light nebulas and comets in the heavens for example and auroras phosphorus and fireflies here on earth
The phe nomena of phosphorescence are by no means so rare as might be imagined
Why as Nichcl showed though any man who uses his eyes can see it him self there is light inherent even in clouds hh this and more Rhodes ex plained to me succinctly but clearly
Oh well find light Bill said he
All the same this subterranean world for which we were bound pre sented some unpleasant possibilities in addition that is to those concom itant to its being habitat of demons and heaven only knew what be sides
And then there is the air said
As we descend it will be come denser and denser until at last wc shall be able to use these icepicks on it Rhodes who was removing his creepers laughed
We will have to make vertical descent of three and onehalf miles below the level of the sea vertical descent of near five miles from this spot where we stand Bill before we reach pressure of even two atmos pheres
The density then increases rapid ly doesn it
Oh yes
Three and half miles more and we are under pressure of fbur atmospheres or about sixty pounds to the square inch
Throe and half miles farther down or ten and onehalf miles in all below the level of the sea and we have pressure upon us of eight atmospheres
Four teen miles and it will be sixteen at mospheres
At thirtyfour miles the air will have the density of water at fortyeight miles it will be as dense as mercury and at fifty miles we shall have it as dense as gold That will do
told him
We can never get down that far have no idea how far we can go down Bill You know that we could never stand such pressures as those know that
But as matter of fact dont know what the pressures are at those depths
Nor does any other man know
What said mo ment ago is of course according to the law but there is something wrong with the law founded upon that of Mariotte as any physicist will tell you Whats wrong with it At any rate the law breaks down as one goes upward and have no doubt that it will be found to do so as one descends below the level of the WEIRD TALES sea
If the densities of the atmos phere decrease in geometrical as the distances from sealevel increase in an arithmetical ratio then at distance of only one hundred miles up we should have virtually per fectvacuum
The rarity there would be absolutely inconceivable
For the atmospheric density at that height would be only one billionth of
what it is at the earth surface
And what is the real density there No man knows or can know re plied Rhodes until he goes up there to see
But meteors rendered incan descent by the resistance they en counter show that state of things exists at that high altitude very dif ferent from the one that would be found there if our formulae were cor rect and our theories were valid
And so have no doubt we shall find it down in Drome
Formulae are very well in their place he went on but we should never forget Bill that they are often budded on mere assumption and that theory is only theory until experi ment or experience has shown us that it is fact
And that reminds me do you know what Percival Lowell says about formulae said didnt
Formulae says
the great as tronomer are the anesthetics of thought commend that very highly Milton added to our fic tion editors and our writers of short stories
But But me no buts Bill said Mil ton
And hat do your scientists know about the interior of this old earth we inhabit anyway
Forsooth but very little Billy me lad
Why they dont even know what volcano is
One cant make journey into the interior of the earth on scratch pad and leadpencil or if he does we may be pardoned if we do not give implicit credence to all that he chooses to tell us when he comes back
For instance one of these armchair Columbuses he made the journey in machine called by dx and came out in China says that he found the interior in state of igneous fluidity
And another
Why he tells us that the hole earth is as rigid as steel that it is solid to the very core
It seems said to be case of Great contest follows and much learned dust Involves the combatants each claim ing truth
And truth disclaiming both The truth in this case is not yet known replied Rhodes though trust that you and Bill are fated to learn it He smiled queer wan smile
Whether we are fated also to re veal it to the world
our world well quien sabe said Milton Rhodes
Then remarked my fingers busy removing my icecreepers what we read about the state of things in the interior of the earth the temperature the pressure the density then all that is pure theory
Of course
How could it be any thing else
All theory save that is the mean density of the earth
And that mean density gives us something to think about for it is just little more than twice that of the surface materials
With all this enormous pressure that we hear so much about and the resultant increase of density with depth the weight of the earth certainly ought to be more than only five and onehalf times that of globe of equal size composed of noth ing but water Kind of queer all right was my comment
It is queer all right as the old lady said when she kissed the cow
However as old Dante has it Son
our time asks thriftier using
As the last word left his lips straightened up the toothed shoes in DROME
my hand and as did so started and cried Hear that
Rhodes made no answer
For some moments we stood there in breathless expectation but that low mysterious sound did not come again
What was that said
wish knew
It was faint and well rather strange It seemed to me told him to be hollow like the sound of some great door suddenly closing
My companion looked at me rather quickly
Think so Bill he said
thought twas the sound of something falling There was pause during which pause we stood listening and waiting but the gallery remained as silent as though it had never known the tread of any living thing
Well Bill said Milton Rhodes suddenly we shall never learn what Drome means if we stay in this spot
As for the creepers am going to leave mine here Milton then wrote short note which recorded little more than our names the date of our great discov ery and that we were going farther
This carefully folded he placed be side the creepers and put rock fragment upon it
wondered as watched him whose would be the eyes that would discover it
Some inhab itant of this underground world of course and to such one the record would be so much Greek
Twas ut terly unlikely that anyone from that world which we were leaving would ever see that record
wondered if we should ever see this spot again
And now Bill said Milton down we go And the next moment we were go ing had begun our descent into this most mysterious and dreadful place
CHAPTER ARE WE ENTERING DANTES INFERNO ITSELF IIhen Scranton came with his weird story of Old He was confess not little puzzled by his and Miltons reference to the extra ordinary scientific possibilities that it presented
At first could not imagine what on earth they meant
But saw all those possibilities very clearly now and thousand more imagined
knew wild joy exulta tion and yet at the same time the wonder and the mystery of it all made me humble and sober of spirit
admit too that fear fear for which can find no adequate name had laid its palsied and cold fingers upon me
In few moments we reached that spot where the angel had vanished
There we paused in curiosity looking about but nothing was to be seen
The gallery which from this point swung sharply to the right and went down at rather steep angle was as silent as some interstellar void
Bill smiled Milton Rhodes he is idle who might be better em ployed
And he started on or rather down
hundred feet however we were now under the glacier and he halted turned his light full upon the lefthand wall pointed and said There you are
Bill the writing on the wall pressed to his side and stood staring
The rock there was as smooth almost as blackboard and upon it traced in white chalk were three inscriptions with what we took to be names appended to them
That on the right was clearly very recent one had been placed there doubtless at the most but few days since by that cavemieolous Venus that Milton Rhodes had seen for so fleeting moment
WEIRD TALES It was Miltons opinion that the characters were alphabetical ones though at first was at loss to un derstand how they could be anything to him but an utter mystery
The letters were formed by straight lines only
The simplest character was like plain capital with the ver tical line somewhat elongated
And it was made to perform the office of another letter by the simple expedi ent of standing it upon its head
The number of crosslines increased up to six three at the top and three at the bottom and in one or two characters there were two vertical lines placed close together
Evidently observed Milton Rhodes this alphabet was con structed on strictly scientific prin ciples
For space we stood there looking wondering what was recorded in that writing so strange and yet after all so very and beautifully simple
Then Milton proceeded to place another record there and as he wrote he hummed When see persons name Scratched upon glass know he owns diamond And his father owns an ass The inscription finished we re sumed our descent
The way soon became steep and very difficult
That Aphrodite of yours ob served as we made our way down particularly rugged place must have the agility of mountaingoat
Your rhetoric Bill is horrible
Wait till you see her youll never be guilty of thinking of goat when she has your thoughts By the way what kind of light did the lady have Light
Dont know
was so interested in the angel herself that never once thought of the light she carried
don know that she needs light anyway What on earth are you talking about
Why fancy Bill that her very presence would make even Plutos gloomy realm bright and beautiful as the Gardens of the Hesperides
Oh gosh was my comment
Wait till you see her Bill Ill probably see her demon first
Hello exclaimed Milton
What now Look at that said he pointing
think we have the explanation of that mysterious sound which you thought was like that of great door suddenly closing in her descent she dislodged rockfragment and that sound we heard must have been pro duced by the mass as it went plung ing down Tis very likely but Great heaven he exclaimed
What is it now
wonder Bill if she lost her footing here and went plunging down too had not thought of that
And the possibility that that lovely and mysterious being lay somewhere down there crushed and bleeding perhaps lifeless made me feel very sad
We sent the rays of our powerful lights down into the silent depths of the tunnel but nothing was visible there save the dark rock and those fearful shadows fearful what with the secrets that might be hidden there
The answer wont come to us Bill said Milton
No returned as we started down we must go get it The gallery at this place had an average width of suppose ten feet and the height would average per haps fifteen
The reader must not picture the walls the roof and the floor as smooth however
The rock was much broken in some spots very jagged
The gallery pitched at an angle of nearly fortyfive degrees which will give some idea of the difficulties encountered in the de scent
DROME At length we reached what may be called the bottom here the tunnel gave another turn and the pitch be came gentle slope
And there we found it the rockfragment weigh ing perhaps two hundred pounds that the angel had dislodged in her descent which doubtless had been hurried wild one
Thank heaven exclaimed she didnt come down with it Amen said Milton
Then sudden thought struck me thought so unworthy that did not voice it aloud
But to myself said It is passible that we may find our selves before we get out of this wishing that she had If human being one of the very best of human beings even were to voice his uttermost his inmost thoughts what shameful terrible monster they would call him or her
And the demon
Where was her demon
could give no adequate descrip tion of those hours that succeeded
Steadily we continued the descent now gentle now steep rugged and difficiilt
Sometimes the way became very narrow indeed at one point we had to squeeze our way through so closely clid the walls approach each other then again it would open out and we would find ourselves in veritable chamber
And in one of these lofty place the vaulted roof hundred feet or more above our heads we made strange discovery skeleton quasihuman and with wings
Are we cried entering Dantes Inferno itself faint smile touched the face of Rhodes
Dont you he asked know what this is It must be the bones of demon
Grandfather Scran ton youll remember wounded that monster up there by the Tamahnowis Rocks
Undoubtedly the bullet reached vital spot and these are the creature bones
But objected these are human bones human skeleton with wings
According to Scranton there was nothing at all human about the appearance of that thing which he called demon admit said Rhodes that this skeleton at the first glance has an appearance remarkably human if that is one can forget the wings
The skull believe more than anything else contributes to that effect and yet at second glance even that loses its human semblance
For look at those terrible teeth
Whoever saw human being with teeth like thase
And look at the large scapula and the small hips and the dwarfish though strong nether limbs
Bat likc Bill strikingly so And those feet they are talons Bill
And see that medial ridge on the sternum for the attachment of the great pectoral muscles batman then queried
should say batape Or an apebat Whichever you prefer smiled Milton
Well added at any rate we have fair idea now of what demon is like Little wonder forsooth that old Sklokoyum had declared the thing was demon from the white mans Inferno
And this creature so dread ful well the angel had it for com panion
When Rhodes saw her she was of course without that terrible attendant undoubtedly the next time though how long would it be
she would not be alone
Oh well consoled myself we have our revolvers WEIRD TALES CHAPTER LIKE BALEFUL EYES ccording to the aneroid this great chamber is about four thousand feet above the level of the sea in other words we had already made vertical descent of some four thou sand feet
We were now about as high above the sea as the snout of the Nisqually
But what was our direc tion from the Tamahnowis Rocks
So sinuous had been this strange subter ranean gallery my orientation had been knocked into cocked hat
It was Miltons belief however that we had been moving in northerly direction that we were still under the peak itself probably under the great Emmons Glacier
confess that would not have cared to place wager on the subject
Goodness only knew where we were but of one thing there could be no doubt we were there
Why asked didnt we bring eomnass think returned Milton slip ping loose his pack and lowering it to the floor that as it was we had case of another straw and the earn ers backs busted
Lets take rest it twenty minutes after and snack
And another thing we wouldnt know whether to trust the compass or not Why so Local attraction Bill
Many in stances of this could be given
One will suffice
Lieutenant Underwood of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition found deviation of thirteen and quarter points on the summit of the Cobu Rock in the Feejees one hun dred and fortvnine degrees
The Island of Nairai was directlv north and yet
according to the compass it bore southeastbysouth one quarter south whilst placed at the foot of the rock that very same compass said Nairai bore north
So you see that that faithful friend to man and es pecially to the mariner has in its friendships some qualities that are remarkably human
Still Rhodes added wish that we had brought one along
Also we should have brought manometer for the aneroid will be worthless after we have descended below sealevel
Oh well the boiling point of water will give us the atmospheric pres sure under pressure of two atmos pheres water boils at Fahren heit under pressure of three at mospheres at four atmos pheres five six seven eight and so on
On the summit of Rainier it boils at about wish that we were headed for the summit said
Eight atmos pheres
When we reach that pres sure if we ever do well be ten and half miles below the level of the sea wont we Rhodes nodded
According to the law
But as remarked there is something wrong with the law
Tis my belief that we shall be able to descend much deep er than ten and onehalf miles that is that the atmospheric pressure will permit us to do so That qualification told him is very apropos for there is no telling what the inhabitants of this underground world will permit us to do or will do to us batapes or ape bats humans or both That of course is very true Bill And said we wont need manometer or we wont need to as certain the boiling point of water to know that the pressure is increasing
Our eardrums will make us painful ly aware of that fact When that comes swaller Billy swaller and the pain will be no more Swallow Swallow Milton nodded
DROME Great Barmecide swallow what Swallow the pain Bill
For look you
Deglutition opens the Eustach ian tube
Some of the dense air en ters the drum and counteracts the pressure on the outside of the mem brane
You keep on swallowing
The air in the drum becomes as dense as that outside there is no pressure on the membrane now or rather the pressures are in perfect equilib rium and presto and abracadabra the pain is gone
Who would have thought it
gink said Rhodes going in to compressed air had better think it
He may have his eardrums burst in if he doesn
But why does the Eustachian tube open only when we swallow
To shut from the ear the sounds produced in the throat and the mouth
If the tube were always open our heads would be so many bedlams
Wonderful nature ex claimed
Oh she does fairly well ad mitted Milton Rhodes
And suppose said that the pain in the ears experienced by those who ascend high mountains is to be explained in the same way only vice versa
They too ought to swal low Of course
At lofty heights the dense air in the drum presses the membrane outward
Swallowing per mits the dense air to escape
One swallows until the pressure on the inside equals that of the rarefied out side air and hocuspocus and presto the pain has evaporated hope said that all our difficulties will be as easily re solved
Hey cried Milton
Whats the matter now Stop swallowing that water
Weve got food sufficient for week but we havent got water to last week or anything like it
Keep up that guzzling and your canteen will be empty before sunset
Sweet Pluto
Sunrise sunset or high noon its all the same here in Erebus Youll say that its very differ ent diyly remaiked Milton Rhodes if you find the fingers of thirst at your throat Surely there is water in this place somewhere Most certainly there is
But we dont know how far we are from that somewhere
And until we get to it our policy Bill must be one of watchful conservation
silence ensued
sank into pro found and gloomy meditation
Four thousand feet down
mile deeper and where should we be
The pros pect certainly was from any point of view dark and mysterious enough to satisfy the wildest dreams of Poe or Dor
To imagine Dantes Inferno however is one thing and to find yourself in it is quite another
Tis true we were not in it yet but we were on our way
hasten to say though that had no thoughts of turning back
No such thought even the slightest was entertained for one single moment
did not blink that was all
be lieved our enterprize was very dangerous one believed it was very probable that we should never return to the light of the sun
Such thoughts are not pleasant are indeed hor rible
And yet in the very horror of them found strange fascination
Yes we might leave our bones in this underground world in this very gal lery even
Even so we should have our own exceeding great reward
For ours would be the guerdon of dy ing in stranger more wonderful quest than any science or discovery ever had known
strange reward and perhaps you wonder what such reward can mean to dying or dead man
All have to say is that WEIRD TALES if you do you know naught of that flaming spirit which moves the scien tist and the discoverer that such as you should never indeed can nev er seek the dread secrets of
nature or journey to her hidden places rested there for exactly one hour
The temperature by the way was Fahrenheit
When we resumed the descent was using the phosphorus lamp instead of the elec tric one
It was not likely that even our electric lights would fail us still there was no guessing what might happen and it might be well thought to adopt policy of light conservation also
As for the phos phorus lamps these would furnish light for six months
In this they were simply wonderful but there was one serious drawback the light emitted was feeble one
The manufacture of this lamp at one time used believe in Paris and probably elsewhere in the maga zines containing explosives is sim plicity itself
Into glass phial is put small piece of phosphorus
The phial is filled twothirds full of olive oil heated to the boiling point
The thing is hermetically corked and there you are
When you wish to use your wonderful little pharos you simply allow air to enter
The space above the oil becomes luminous then
You replace the cork and
the phial remains sealed until there is occasion to restore the waning light which you do of course by allowing more air to enter
As has been said such phial will furnish light for half year
These phials of ours were set each in metal frame and protected by guard in such fashion that it would take heavy blow to break the glass
When not in use the were kept in strong metal cylinders
Of course the electric light could be turned on at any instant
There were places where the gal lery pitched in way to make the head swim many spots in which we had to exercise every caution false step might have spelled irrevocable disaster
wondered how the angel had passed down those difficult plac es and many pictures of that mys terious creature as wondered came and went
Well she had passed down and that without mishap
Where was she now
Indeed where were we ourselves
Steadily we toiled our downward way
For long distance the gallery ran with but slight deviation either to the right or to the left though the descent was much broken mean now was steep and now gentle now at some angle intermediate
Rhodes thought that we were now moving in an easterly direction it might have been north east south or west for all knew
Not trickle of water had we seen not even single drop which confess caused some unpleasant thoughts to flicker through my mind
At clock we were two thousand feet above sealevel at half past about half thousand
And we then decided to call it day
Nor was at all sorry to do so even though we might be near some strange even great discovery for was very tired and sore from the
top of my head to the end of my toes
was in fair trim and so was Rhodes but it would take us some time to get used to such work as this
very gentle current of air so slight that it required experiment to detect it was passing down the gal lery
The temperature here was Fahrenheit
We had stepped before cavity in the wall and in that little chamber we passed the night one holding watch whilst the other slept
My dreams were dreadful but otherwise the night was as peaceful as any that ever passed over Eden
Neither Rhodes nor during that strange eery vigil there in the heart DROME of the living rock heard even the faintest most fleeting sound
As the watcher sat there waiting and listen ing whilst the minutes slowly passed he found himself at any rate know that did almost wishing that some pulsation would come so heavy and awful was
the stillness of the place
But sound we were to hear
We had been journeying for about an hour and half and had just passed below sealevel
In that place Rhodes had left the aneroid
Of sudden Milton who was leading the way halted with low sharp interjection for silence
When my look struck him he was standing in an attitude of the most riveted attention
he exclaimed
Did you hear that Bill The air had pulsed to the faintest sound now all was still again
What was it asked my voice whisper
Dont know Bill
There Again that gentle pulsation touched the ear and again it was gone
And strange thing was that for the life of me could not have told whether it came from below or from behind ms There it is again said Rhodes
flashed on my electric light to the full power
whisper exclaimed
And great heaven Milton What now Bill he asked quick ly
Its something behind ns He started
He turned his light up the tunnel and for some moments we stood peering intently
Not moving thing was to be seen there however only the moving shadows
Again said Milton Rhodes
But it isnt whisper Bill
And it didnt come from up there The thing told him could be hiding in shadow Its not up there it is ahead Wherever it is what on earth can it be
what does it mean That we shall learn
TTe resumed our descent every sense you may be sure on the qui vive
The tunnel here inclined rather steeply little space howev er and the dip was gentle one
The sounds soon became ono steady un broken whisper then dull melan choly murmur
Abruptly Rhodes stopped turned to me and he laughed
Know now what it is Bill This was not moment thought for laughter or anything like it
Sounds like the growling of beasts said peering intently down the passage
wonder if the angel there are two kinds of angel you know has turned loose whole pack or flock of those demons
To my surprize and astonishment Rhodes burst into outright laughter
Well said rather testily
Why all the cachinnation Forgive me Bill
But it isnt pack of demons or flock How on earth do you know what it is Its water Water Yes
Im from Missouri
Youd better see that your revolver is handy
Who ever heard water make shivery sound like that You see though think that you ll hear first
Ere long there could be no doubt about it Milton was right it was the sound of falling water
Must be at quite distance said sounds carry long way in tubes and that is what this tvrnnel is Steadily we made our way along and down and just as steadily the sound increased in volume
The gal lery made several sharp turns and then of sudden the sound rose from WEIRD TALES loud growl to roar and an ex clamation burst from us
It were impossible to convey to the reader the eery effect of that sud den strange transition
One moment we were in the gallery the next we had issued from it and stood in most tremendous cavern or rather on ledge or shelf high up on one of the walls of that cavern
The opposite side was but dimly visible
The roof swept across hundred feet or more above our heads
And the bottom
gazed at the edge of the rock shelf on which stood out and down into that yawning abyss and felt shudder run through me and on through my heart
The roar of the falling waters came from our right
We turned the rays of our lights in that direction but nothing was visible there save the dark limestone rock and Cim merian blackness
We then moved to the edge and turned our lights down into those awful depths to depths perhaps nev er before touched by ray of light since time began
Far down the beams went plunging and farther still but we could not see the bottom
Bottom there was however for the water was tumbling and growling down there
was glad to draw back from the edge and leaned against the rock wall and gazed upon the dark scene in wonder amazement and awe
Rhodes joined me
Well what do you think of it Bill Milton this is awful It is
have never seen sight more strange and terrible And the angel queried
What about her Bill How on earth did she make her way through this awful place Why along this ledge on which we are standing
There is no other way glanced along that shelf and felt very sad
Shes got better head told him than have
Why didnt we bring along an airplane
wonder if the way lies down or up toward the fall We bent over and examined the rock
Down observed
Down Milton nodded
Whilst stood there pondering this and wondering what was down there in the blackness of that fright ful chasm Rhodes moved off to the right and examined the ledge there
And up too he announced
Somebody or something or both has gone up toward the fall
Great heaven if we get caught between them
The program is becoming inter esting Rhodes admitted
For time we stood in silence then Milton said suggest that we go up and take looksee
So far as could per ceive one way was just as good mean just as bad as the other
That shelf was as whole not
an easy thing to negotiate and some spots made my head swim and made me wish mightily that was some where else
Undoubtedly some thou sands of years in the dim and mys terious past the stream once flowed at this level at any rate that is the only theory that in my opinion will explain that ledge and something we were soon to discover
Not that ever spent much time in worrying about theories and hypotheses the facts themselves gave me enough to think about enough and to spare
At times the shelf would be twenty or thirty feet in width or even more and then the going was easy enough but at other times the space would contract to couple of yards and then it was another story
Once or twice Milton Rhodes himself an ex perienced and fearless mountain DROME climber was glad believe that the way was no narrower
As for what those moments meant to me well never posed as mountaineer or steeplejack
For fifteen minutes or so believe we toiled along that terrible place and then of sudden came to the end
Nothing before us but the bare precipitous rocky wall and the black profundity of the chasm and up above ghostly thing crawling crawling down ever down and filling the place with thunder the fall it self
Where did the water come from
And question more inter esting where did it go
We must go back said Milton Rhodes
The road to Drome does not lie here Scarcely had we turned when started and then cried out sharply
Look said pointing with my alpenstock down the cavern
Look at that
Far down the cave light was gleaming where moment before no light had been
And on the instant another shone beside it
second or two however and they had vanished
Moving was Rhodes explana tion
No told him
And look
Again There they were gleaming at us for all the world like the dim and baleful eyes of some waiting monster
CHAPTER THATS WHERE THEY ARE WAITING FOR US ew some moments those yellow eyes gleamed at us then van ished
The lids of that waiting mon ster so to speak had elosed over them
had watched them very closely and was sure that there had been no movement of the eyes themselves
Milton however was just as sure that they had moved
To the right or to the left queried
Down said Rhodes
Then it must have been straight down
It was behind rock mass or something
We waited watching closely but those yellow eyes did not gleam again through that Stygian gloom
Must have been at quite dis tance remarked at last
It seems so Bill and that means that this cavern is very straight for mile or more or that it is one of enormous size It may be both It may be And it may be that those lights were not so far away as they appeared to be
One may eas ily be deceived in such matters We dont know what it means said but we know this were spotted
Oh were seen all right Bill
Our every movement will be watched
Some minutes passed during which we stood peering down the cavern and waiting but no light gleamed forth again
Then we started back
Wed better keep sharp look out said suddenly
Remember demon doesnt have to come along the ledge have not forgotten that Bill but we are armed As believe was made sufficient ly obvious the crossing of those places where the ledge narrowed to the width of but couple of yards had been no pleasant matter but during the return the thing assumed an aspect truly sinister
That we were being watched both of us regarded as certain
That we might at any mo ment find demon or dozen demons driving at us well that was pos sibility which never left our thoughts for one single second
And in those narrow places where the ledge con tracted to mere ribbon of rock it
WEIRD TALES was all one wanted to do to hug the wall and make sure of his footing
frightful place truly in which to meet even with revolver the attack of even one of those winged mon sters and we might find ourselves attacked by dozen
It can easily be imagined then the relief which felt when we had passed the last narrow spot though forsooth we might be going toward something far more terrible than any we had left behind us
But the angel had gone down and where woman could go there told myself in mas culine pride could we also
That is subjoined suppos ing we do not meet apebats or some thing more terrible
At length we stood once more at the mouth of the gallery
And scarce ly had we stopped there when an un pleasant thing flashed into my thoughts which as it was resembled anything but the rainbow
Great heaven cried peering into the tunnel which at the dis tance of only thirty feet or so gave sudden turn to the right
Something could be in there very close to us and yet unseen
What is it Bill Could those lights that we saw have been here
Are they waiting in there to dog our steps or to do some thing worse Rhodes peering into the gallery with curious halfvacuous expres sion on his face made no reply
Well queried what do you think of it
We could not tell where those lights were how far away anything
dont think that they were here Milton Rhodes returned
think they were much farther down and on the other side On the other side
How on earth could anyone cross that chasm
We dont know what it is like down there
And of course dont know that the lights were on the other side
But believe that they were
silence ensued which at length broke What is the next thing on the program
Make our way down the ledge
That is the only way we can go
But first we ll try little finesse
He took position in the mouth of the tunnel one
that permitted him to look down the cavern
He signed to me to follow suit and when stood at his side he said Off go the lights
Off they went and the terrible blackness was upon us
So terrible was it and so strange and fearful that place in which we stood actually found myself wondering if it would not all prove dream
Why asked at last did we do this To see if the lights will show again
They may think that we have lost heart and started back
saw it all now instead of our advancing to those mysterious beings somewhere down the cavern he would bring them to us
But they did not come
They did not show even the faintest light
We waited there for many minutes but nothing whatever was seen
Hum said Rhodes at last snap ping on his light Wary folk Bill these Hypogeans
And so replied well have to go to them That what we shall have to do
Walk maybe right into trap It is possible Rhodes admitted
But it is possible too that the trap may not prove so terrible possible indeed that there is no trap at all
tell you certainly would like to see that angel again Then lets go see her Thats what well do And so we started
DROME strange indefinable dread had its grip upon me and yet was anxious to go to put the thing to an issue
In all probability we should not have far to travel
Nor in fact did we
The way was much like the one that we had traversed in the opposite direction
One or two spots were ev en more dangerous than any we had found up there
And over these dangerous terrible places where false step or slip of the foot on the smooth rock would have meant most horrible death along this airy dizzy Stygian way the angel had passed
Well she was brave angel at any rate
We were descending all the while sometimes at an angle that was glad was no steeper
This does not mean however that our distance from the bottom of that terrible chasm on our right was decreasing
The sounds that came up from the black depths of it told plainly that the descent of tlie stream was as pro nounced as that of the ledge we were following and perhaps more so
And heres something that dont understand was my remark as we stopped in particularly bro ken spot to say nothing of our be ing below sealevel here this stream has been pouring down for untold centuries for how many thousands of years no man can even guess and yet the place isnt full
Where does all the water go
Think was Miltons answer of all the rivers that for how many millions of years no man can tell have been running into the sea and yet the sea is not overflowing
don see the application of that to this underground world dont see how all the water there must be more streams than this can possibly return as vapor to the region above
admit Rhodes said that the problem is formidable one and that with our present paucity of data we can not hope to solve it
Still think my
suggestion sound
But where are the openings to permit the escape of so enonnous for enormous it must be an amount of water vapor There may be countless vents fissures Bill ways of egress that man will never know
Whatever the ex planation there can be no doubt that the ater is going down and that this subterranean world is not full But where does it go
Down to some sunless sea perhaps though if that hypothesis of yours is sound one bathed in light light never seen in that world we have left on land or sea Rhodes was silent for moment leaning on his alpenstock
Then It is strange truly the descent of the waters
And yet it would not believe have been to you so very strange thing had you known that the sea itself flows into the earth
The sea itself
Rhodes nodded
Surely Milton why the thing is Jules Vemesque On the contrary the fact has long been known
At Argostoli in the Island of Cephalonia the sea flows right into the limestone rock
Shades of Lemuel Gulliver but this old ball that men call the earth is certainly strange old sphere
How strange said Milton Rhodes no scientist has ever dreamed though your scientist has thought of things far stranger than The cases are certainly not numerous where marine currents are known to pour continuously into cavities beneath the surface of th earth but there is at least one wellauthenticated instance of this sort that of the mill streams at Argostoli in the island of Cephalonia
It had been lorn
observed that the sea water flowed into several rifts and cavities in the limestone rocks of the coast but the phenomenon has excited litte at tention until very recently
three of the entrances were closed and regular channel six teen feet long and thre fet with fall of three feet was cut into the mouth of larger cavity
The sea water flowed into this canal and could be followed eighteen or twenty feet be yond its inner terminus when it disappeared in holes and clefts in the rock George Marsh Man and Nature
WEIRD TALES any ever conceived by your wildest romancer who after all Bill is pretty tame homo have an idea said glancing down the cavern that we are going to find the homos here in this place anything but tame Milton laughed and without any other answer turned and resumed the descent
For one thing was profoundly thankful the wall ran along with out any pronounced cavities or pro jections in it so that we had little to appiehend from sudden attack on this our giddy way except or course by demon
Had the wall been broken one any instant might have found us face to face with band of Hypogeans as Rhodes called the denizens of this subterranean place
But how long would the wall re main like that
And after all did it really greatly matter
Meeting sooner or later was inevitable
Tis true could not conceive of worse place than this supposing the meet ing to be in any measure an un friendly one
And from what had happened up there at the Tamahno wis Rocks could not suppose that it would be anything else
This however was to prove simply another instance of how inadequate the imagination when confronted with the reality is sometimes found to be for even now we ere drawing near place more terrible even than this and that was the place where we met
It required but little imagination though to make us aware and pain fully so of the extreme probability regarded by ourselves as certi tude that eyes were watching our every movement
But where were those eyes
And what were the watchers
To what fearful thing or could it be wonderful
were We drawing near at every single moment now
Some minutes passed perhaps fif teen perhaps more can not say how long it was
Of sudden how ever Rhodes who was still leading the way stopped
sound had es caped him and he stood there like statue peering intently straight ahead
Look there he said in low voice pointing with his alpenstock and tell me what you see was already looking and already had seen it
But what on earth was that thing which saw
remained silent gazing with straining eyesand wondering if really saw what thought that did
What asked Rhodes do you make of it The thing is so faint
Tis im possible and yet if it were not so would say that it is an arch part of bridge Just what thought
The thing is so strange though that didnt know whether to believe my eyes or not
And so dim observed that it may be nothing of the kind
Now who on earth would build bridge across this frightful chasm
And why Quien sake Bill said Milton Rhodes
The next moment we were moving toward it
Look ejaculated Rhodes sud denly
It goes clear aeross Yes said stopping and gazing at that strange dim mass it goes clear across
And thats the place over there on the other side thats where they are waiting for us CHAPTER THE ANGEL AND HER DEMON shouldnt be bit surprized said Milton
Aid strange bridge that truly
It looks like ruin ruin that has not fallen DROME It was ruin indeed
So ruinous was it that wondered how the mass could possibly remain intact
short advance however and the mystery was solved
The hand of man had not builded that great arch across this dreadful chasm nature had fash ioned it there in that region of ever lasting darkness
It has Rhodes said remarkable semblance to the cele brated Natural Bridge in Virginia
short space and we stood upon it gazing across
Its width here was about sixty feet
The surface was comparatively speaking smooth one and it had rather pronounced slope upward circumstance by no means conducive to security of foot ing
And feature that noticed with some unpleasant misgivings was the diminution of width at the far ther end
Just how wide it was there wc could not tell what with the un certain light that struggled to the spot but we saw enough to know that that way which we should have to cross was very narrow one indeed and on either side the black chasm yawning to receive us
And just be yond dim and ghostly as though seen in dream stupendous columns rose up and were involved in the darkness of the lofty cavern
What on earth arc those queried
It reminds one of Grec ian temple Limestone pillars no doubt re turned Milton
And its there exclaimed my voice however low and guarded that they are waiting for us
That is where those lights were suppose so
Theyll wait until we get in that cursed narrow place and then And then Well told him we had bet ter say our prayers before we start across Rhodes laughed
thought though that there was touch of the sardonic in his laugh
Little wonder forsooth if twas so for the thing was fraught ith terrible possibili ties
What asked are we to do Cross over if we are permitted to do so If we should be permitted to do so
gazed into the black profundity of the chasm and felt very sad
Holy Gorgons said havent we got into fine pickle though Ill tell you what well do Bill you remain here like Horatius at the bridge while explore along the ledge
dont like it told him
United we stand well you know the rest of it He was silent for some moments
Then think that we can risk it
Bill Very well acquiesced shrug ging my shoulders
But tell you that don like it at all
The next moment however he had turned and as moving down the ledge
stepped back to the wall upon which two inscriptions were traced and waited the result with such composure as could summon
At last Rhodes moved behind projection in the wall
moment and the glow of his light had van ished
ne was gone and was alone in that terrible place
The blackness seemed to increase the shadows to thicken about me and grow denser
But one sound broke the awful silence which sound seemed to have quality tangible crushing the growl of the water in the abysmal depths of the chasm
And even that sound as stood there listening watching waiting seemed to change it seemed to sink to mur mur
then whisper as though evil spirits were hushing it to lull my sus picions and even my very senses
What was that
started and something shot through my very heart chilling and sharp as the needle point of an icicle
WEIRD TALES Surely had seen it
There it was again dim but unmistakable there by one of the great columns single point of light an eye staring at me with greenish fire
Yes there it was
Then of sud den it was gone
For time stood peering and waiting the blood throbbing in my ears but it was not seen again
turned and looked down the ledge and gave an exclamation that was one of relief and joy for there was Rhodes just come into view around that projection in the wall
What asked as he drew near did you find down there We cant go down
The shelf is broken nothing but sheer wall be tween
So its across the bridge for us
We may never reach the other side And then told him what had seen
And asked didnt Grand father Scranton say that the eyes of the demon burned with greenish fire Rhodes nodded
Of course though he said light has to reach them or the eyes cant shine
In absolute darkness they would not do so That eye shone though ghostly for the light that reaches that spot is dim
And so the angel at least and heaven only knows what besides is waiting there with her demon Yes Bill there can be no doubt that the eye which you saw belonged to demon
The prospect is certain ly sinister one admit silence ensued
Of sudden Rhodes raised his voice and hallooed Hello there The answer came almost on the in stant Hello there hello there hello there hello hello
Tis only Echo lovely Echo smiled Milton Rhodes
Again he raised his voice and again the words were thrown back at him
Hear that Bill he cried whilst the echoes were still sounding
heard it That was no echo
No said it was no echo We waited listening intently but that sound which had come with the echoes was not heard again
Rhodes drew his revolver and ex amined the weapon most carefully
He looked at me curiously and then he said have no desire Bill to disguise the fact that this crossing may prove most most Bill it may prove You neednt tell me said
know very well what it may mean
But we cant turn back Bill No we cant turn back He reached out his hand and grasped mine
And then without another word we started
had known some critical tei rible horrible scenes in my life but never anything like the suspense and mystery of those moments that now succeeded
What were we to see
What were we to meet
And hor ror of horrors it would be in that place where the bridge narrowed to mere ribbon the frightful depths yawning on each side almost at our veiy feet
Well at last we reached it
My head began to swim so terrible was the place and had to stop and get grip upon my nerves
Rhodes too paused and for some moments we stood there so near to safety and yet the mockery of it
closer than ever to mystery and danger and perhaps horror unnamable
Now for it Bill said Rhodes
Keep your revolver ready for in stant action And we started across
The place was so narrow that we could not think of walking side bv side
Rhodes was leading
And then it came when we had taken eight or DROME ten steps when we had reached the most dangerous spot on that ribbon of rock
Of sudden dark figure strain ing at its leash moved from behind one of the limestone pillars and two eyes shone horribly in the light burning with greenish fire and the strong rays were flashed back in the horrid gleam of teeth
And be side that demoniac shape tall fig ure appeared figure clothed in white the eyes wide and blazing the face white as snow and framed in gleaming gold which fell in mass es about the shoulders figure ma jestic indescribably lovely and dread ful
It was the angel and her demon
CHAPTER THE ATTACK npHAT strange weird scene like some terrible vision from the pages of Dor often rises before me the tall white figure of the angel the dark squatting winged monster before her and we two men from the sunlit world standing there upon that narrow way the black profund ity of the chasm yawning on either side of us
The angel had indeed well chosen the moment
If that hideous ape bat straining at its leash were loosed at us our position despite our revolvers would be truly hor rible one
Scarce twentyfive feet lay between the monster and our selves
In case of attack we would have to drop the monster in its spring and only lucky shot could do that or the result would be most disastrous one
For we could not meet an attack there to step aside or to meet the demon in struggle would mean plunge over the edge
It was indeed critical appalling scene one in which have no de sire to see even my worst enemy placed
Our fate thought was in the hands of that whiterobed white faced being whom we knew as the angel
The dembn however as will be seen in moment was to take the matter in his own hands if may use that expression in speaking of that monster for hands the thing had none
can easily see how the demon in the obscurity of the fog had seemed to old Scranton thing that had no shape
But here the strong rays of our lights turned full upon the demon the sight was an altogether different one
And stranger sight surely no man had ever seen up there in that world which we had left that world so near to us still and yet it seemed so very far away now
It was as though some Circe had changed us into figures in some dread story of ancient days
And this was what men called the Twentieth Century the golden age of science and dis covery
Well science doesnt yet know everything fact that am sorry to say some scientists them selves are very prone to forget
Heavens said Rhodes keeping his look fixed on those figures before us isnt she wonderful crea ture And it said an awful thing
And wait while before saying that she is wonderful
She may prove to be something very dif ferent
The next instant gave cry
The demon had made sudden strain forward
Came sharp word from the angel and that cerberus sank back again
But though it sank back that greenish fire in its eyes seemed to burn more fiercely malevolently than before
think suggested it would be good plan to move back little back to safer wider spot Move back
Never said Mil ton Rhodes
We are here to move forward not to go back WEIRD TALES thought this utterly Quixotic but of course if he didnt want to go back couldnt make him
And if he wouldnt step back neither would
Look said
She is going to speak The angel raised her left hand and motioned to us rather vehement ly at the same time uttering some word or words
No mistaking that Bill said Milton
No it is as plain as any words could be Go back
am at loss said Rhodes how to answer Again the angel raised her hand but she did not motion this time for the demon with bloodcurdling sound deep in its throat strained forward again and so suddenly and strongly that the angel was drawn forward step or two
sharp word however from the angel and the monster settled back as dog does after straining at its leash
Once more the angel fixed her eyes upon us or rather upon Mil ton Rhodes
Once more she raised her hand to sign to us to go back
But the sign was never given
At that instant as the angel stood there with upraised hand it hap pened
That sound came again only more horrible than before and the demon sprang at us
Caught thus off her guard the angel was jerked whirled forward
There was wild pierc ing cry which rose to scream but the winged monster paid not the slightest heed
It was as though the thing had gone mad
The angel went down in an instant however she was up again
She screamed at the demon but it lunged toward us flapping its great hideous wings and dragging her after it out onto the bridge
Her position now was one of peril scarcely less than our own
All this had passed of course with the quickness of thought
We could not fire for fear of hitting the angel right behind the demon we could not move back and we could not stand there and let this night mare monster come upon us
In second or two if nothing was done it could do so
But what could we do
The thought of saving our selves by killing the woman and the chances were hundred to one that we should kill her if we fired at the demon was horrible one
But to stand there and be sent over the edge was horrible too
And the angel in all probability would be killed anyway that she had not al ready been jerked from the rock was nothing less than miracle
Why didnt she loose her hold on the leash
These are some of the things that flashed through my mind yes even then
never before knew what rapid thing thought can be
Oh those things that shot through my brain in those brief horrible sec onds
My whole life from child hood to that very moment flashed before me liko the film of cinema tograph though with the speed of light
wondered what death was like what it would be like some where in the depths of that black gulf
And wondered why the angel did not loose her hold on that leash
didnt know that she had wrapped the chain around her hand and that the chain had in some way got caught
The poor angel could not free herself
Little wonder forsooth that she was screaming so fearfully
We must risk it cried
Hold The next instant Milton Rhodes had stepped aside yes stepped right to the very edge of the rock
The demon whirled at him and as it whirled one of its great wings struck me full across the face
gave myself up for lost but some DROME how kept my plaoe on that ribbon of rock
Another instant and the monster would be at Milton throat
But no
From this dizzy position which he had so suddenly taken the angel was no longer behind the demon and on the instant Rhodes fired
Oh that scream which the mon ster gave
It struck the rock and that Rhodes managed to keep his footing on the edge of that fearful place is one of the most amazing things that have ever seen
But keep it he did and he fired again and again
The demon flapped back ward jerked the angel to
her knees and near the edge and then suddenly flat on her face
The next instant the monster disappeared
Its wings were beating against the rock with spasmodic hideous sound
gave cry of relief and joy but the next moment one of dismay and
horror broke from me
The monster was dragging the angel over the edge
CHAPTER INTO THE CHASM ilton Rhodes threw himself prone on the rock and his right arm around the angels waist
Quick Bill quick
Her arm the whole weight of the monster Her sereams had ceased but from her throat broke moan long tremulous heartrending sound to shake and rend my already quiv ering nerves to enhance most dread fully the indescribable horror of the scene and the moment
could do nothing where was had to step over the prostrate forms which in my heated imagination were being dragged over the edge
The wings of the demon were still beating against the rock the blows not so strong but more spasmodic the sound leathery sickening tat too
It will probably be remembered that the angel had held the demon with her right hand
was now on the angels right and stretched out on the rock reached down over the edge in an effort to free her from that dragging monster the black depths over which we hung turning me dizzy and faint
now saw how the angel had been caught and that she had been dragged so far over the edge that could not longarmed though am reach the leash
So grasped her arm and with word of encourage ment began to pull
Slowly we drew the monster up
Another mo ment
and the chain would be with in the reach of my other hand
Yes there
Steady so
had reached down my other hand my fingers were in the very act of closing on the chain when horrors felt my self slipping along the smooth rock slipping over into that appalling gulf
To save myself had to let go the angels arm and as the chain jerked to the monsters weight an awful cry broke from the angel and from Milton Rhodes and saw her body dragged farther over
Cut it Bill cut it Its chain Rhodes groaned
We must try again
Great heav en we cant let her be dragged over This horrible spot makes the head swim Steady Bill steady said Rhodes
Here hold her while get grip with my other arm
Then ll get hold on you with my right Well all be dragged over Nonsense said Rhodes
And besides Ive got hold with my feet now in crack or something few moments and was again reaching down Rhodes grip upon me this time
Again laid hold on WEIRD TALES the angels arm and again she and drew the monster up
This time though got my other hand on the chain
And yet even then the chain hanging slack above my hand the angel was some time in freeing her own from the fingers of which blood was dripping
But at last she had loosened the chain hnd then let go my hold upon it and down the demon went still flapping its wings though feebly now and disappeared into those black and fearful depths
have no recollection of any sound coming up
Undoubtedly sound came
Little wonder for sooth that did not hear it
moment and was back from the edge and Milton and were drawing the angel to the safety of that narrow way
She sank back in Rhodes arms her eyes closed her head almost hidden in the gleaming golden hair on her shoulder
Shes fainted said
Little wonder if she has Bill
But she had not
Scarcely had he spoken when she opened her eyes
At once she sat tip and saw faint color suffuse those snowy features
Well said to myself what ever else she may be our angel is human We remained there for little while recovering from the effects of the horrible scene through which we had passed then arose and started for that place of safety there amongst the wonderful stupendous limestone pillars
was now mov ing in advance and confess and nothing could more plainly show how badly my nerves had been shaken that would gladly have covered those few remaining yards on all fouls if my pride would have permitted me to do so
Yes there we stood by that very pillar behind which the angel had waited for us with her demon
There was her lamp lantern rather dark of course though not ex tinguished
looked at it and looked all around
We saw two lights said
And yet she was waiting here alone There certainly were two lights Bill two persons at least
Her com panion went somewhere that is the only explanation can think of wonder where said and what for Help perhaps
You know Bill have an idea that if we had de layed much longer our reception there and he waved hand toward the bridge would have been very different one It was interesting enough to suit me
And as it is heaven only knows what is to follow
The angel standing there straight and still was watching us intently so strange look in her eyes those eyes were blue that chill passed through my heated brain and actually began to wonder if was being hypnotized
And in this cursed spot
turned my lbok straight into the eyes of the angel and as looked flung secret curse at that strange weakness of mine and called myself fool for haying entertained even for fleeting moment thought so absurd
Rhodes had noticed and he turned his look upoii me and upon the wo man this creature so indescribably lovely and yet with so indefinable mysterious Sibylline something about her
For some moments there was silence
thought that saw fear in those blue eyes of hers but could not be sure
That strange look whether one of fear or of something else was not all that saw there
but strove in vain to find name
or meaning for what saw
DROME Science science
This was the age of science the age of the air plane the submarine radium tele vision and radio and yet here was scene to make Science herself rub her eyes in amazement scene that might have been taken right out of some wild story or out of some myth of the ancient world
Well that ancient world too had its science some of which science fear though this thought would have brought poohpooh from Milton Rhodes man has lost to his sorrow
And like that ancient world so per haps had this strange underground world which we had entered or rather were trying to enter
And perhaps of that science or some phases of it this angel before us had fearful command
One moment told myself that we should need all the courage we possessed all the ingenuity and re source of that science of which Mil ton Rhodes himself was the master the next that was letting my imagination overleap itself
My thoughts were suddenly bro ken by the voice of Milton
Goodness Bill look at her hand
forgot He stepped toward the angel and gently lifted her blooddripping hand
The chain had sunk right in to the soft wrist
The angel how ever with smile and movement with her left hand gave us to un derstand that the hurt was nothing
The next moment she gave an ex clamation and gazed past me down the pillared cavern
Instantly turned and as did so too ex claimed
There far off amongst the columns two yellow wrathful lights were gleaming and dark hurrying figures were moving toward us
CHAPTER WHAT DID IT MEAN
npHE help is coming Bill said Milton Rhodes
And that re minds me haven reloaded my re volver
would lose no time in doing so told him
He got out the weapon and pro ceeded to reload it
It was not
by the way one of these newfangled things but one of your good old fashioned revolvers solid substan tial one that would stand hard us age piece to be depended upon
And that was what we needed weapons to be depended upon
The angel was watching Rhodes closely
wondered if she knew what had killed her demon knew mean that this metal thing with its glitter so dull and so cold was weapon
It was extremely unlikely that she had in that horrible mo ment on the bridge seen what actually had happened
However that might have been it was soon plain that she recognized the revol ver as weapon or at any rate guessed that it was
With an interjection she stepped to Rhodes side and with swift pantomime she assured us that there was nothing at all to apprehend from those advancing figures
After all Milton said slipping the revolver into his pocket why should we be so infernally sus picious
Maybe this world is very different from our own It seems to me told him my right hand in that pocket which con tained my revolver that we have good cause to be suspicious
Have you forgotten what Grandfather Scranton saw up there at the Tamahnowis Rocks and what he didnt see and the horrible death there of Rhoda Dillingham to say nothing of what happened to us here few minutes ago
That we WEIRD TALES are not at the bottom of that chasm well am not anxious to have an other shave like that have not forgotten Bill
have an idea though that those aw ful tragedies up there were purely accidental
Certainly we know that the demons attack upon ourselves was entirely so Accidental
Great Scott some consolation that looked at Milton Rhodes and looked at the angel who had taken few steps forward and was await ing those hurrying figures white robed figure still and tall one love ly majestic
And if didnt sigh certainly felt like doing so
No demon there Bill observed Milton at last his eyes upon those advancing forms
see none
Four figures
Four nodded Rhodes
Two men and two women few moments and they stepped out into sort of aisle amongst the great limestone pillars
The figure in advance came to an abrupt halt
An exclamation broke from him and echoed and reechoed eerily through the vast and gloomy cavern
It was answered by the angel and as her voice came murmuring back to us it was as though fairies were hid den amongst the columns and were answering her
But there was nothing fairylike in the aspect of that leader who was advancing again or his male companion
That aspect was grim formidable
Each carried power ful bow and had an arrow fitted to the string and at the left side short heavy sword
That aspect of theirs underwent remarkable metamorphosis however as they came on toward us what with the explanations that our angel gave them
When they at last halted few yards from the spot where we stood every sign of hostility had vanished
It was patent however that they were wary suspicious
That they should be so was not at all strange but just the same there was something in their man ner that could not understand something that made me resolve to be on my guard whatever might be tide
The leader was tall man of sinewy and powerful frame
Though he had judged passed the half century mark he had suffered it seemed no loss of youthful vitality or strength
His companion tall and almost as powerful as himself was much younger man in his early twenties
Their golden hair was bobbed for all the world like your truly bobbified flappers
The arms were bare as ere the legs from midway the thigh to halfuay below the knee the nether extrem ities being incased in buskins light but evidently of excellent material
As for the companions of the twain one was girl seventeen or eighteen years of age the other girl couple of years older
Each had bow and quiver as did our angel
The older of these young ladies had golden hair shade light er than the angels whilst the hair of the younger was white as snow
At first thought that it must be powdered but this as not so
And as gazed with interest and wonder upon this lovely creature thought of Christopher Columbus and Sir Isaac Newton
At thirty they had hair like hers
That thought how ever was fleeting one
This was no time forsooth to be thinking of old Christopher and Sir Isaac
Stranger more wonderful was this old world of ours than even Colum bus or Newton ever had dreamed it
The age of our angel by the way placed at about twentyfive years
And wondered how they could pos sibly reckon time here in this under ground world world that could have neither months nor years
DROME The quartfct listened eageilv to the explanations given by our angel
Suddenly the leader addressed some question to Persephone as Rhodes called her
And then we heard it
Drome was her answer
There it was distinct unmistak able that mysterious word which had given us so many strange and wild thoughts and visions
Yes there it was and it was an answer thought that by no means put the mans mind at ease
Drome at last
But What did it mean
There we distinctly heard the angel pro nounce the word again
If we could only have understood the words being spoken
But there was no mistaking thought the manner of the angel
It was earliest and yet strangely enough that Sibylline quality about her was now more pro nounced than ever
But there was no mistaking her manner she was endeavoring to reassure him to al lay it seemed some strange uneasi ness or fear
noticed however with some vague sinister misgivings that in this she was by no means as successful as she herself desired
Why did we see in the eyes of the leader and in those of the others so strange so mysterious look whenever those eyes were turned toward that spot where Milton Rhodes and stood
However these gloomy thoughts were suddenly broken but certainly not banished
With an acquiescent reply at any rate so thought it to the angel the leader abruptly faced us
He placed his bow and arrow upon the ground slipped the quiver from his back drew his sword it was doublebladed
now noted from its scabbard and de posited them too upon the ground
His companion was following suit the two girls who were now hold ing the lights standing by motion less and silent
The men advanced few paces
Each placed his sword hand over his heart uttered something in meas ured and sonorous tones and bowed low to us proceeding noted out of the corner of my eye that not little pleased our angel
CHAPTER THAT WE ONLY KNEW THE SECRET VXell remarked Milton Rhodes his expression one of the utmost gravity when in Drome Bill do as the Dromans do And we returned the bow of the Hypogeans hereupon the men stepped back to their weapons which they at once resumed and the young woman without moving from the spot inclined her head to us in most stately fashion
Bow again from Rhodes and myself
This ceremony over hoped that we had done the thing handsomely the angel turned to us and told us in pantomime of course that we Avere now friends and that her heart was glad
Friends said to myself
You are no gladder madam than am but all the same am going to be on my guard The girls mo ed to the angel and with touching tenderness examined her bleeding Avrist which the young er at once proceeded to bandage carefully
She had made to bathe the wound but this the angel had not permitted from Avhieh it Avas patent that there Avould be no access to water for some time yet
Our Amalthea and her companions now held an earnest consultation
Again AA heard her pronounce that word Drome
And again we saAv in the look and mien of the others doubt and uneasiness and something thought besides
But this Avas for feAV moments only
Either they acquiesced wholly in Avhat the angel WEIRD TALES urged or they mashed their feel ings
wished that knew which it was
And yet had known should have been none the wiser forsooth unless had been cognizant of what it was that the angel was urging so earnestly and with such confidence
That it was something closely con cerning ourselves was of course obvious
That it or part of it was to the effect that we should be tak en to some place was believed virtually certain
Not that this made matters whit clearer or in any measure allayed my uneasiness
For where were we to be taken
And to what
To Drome
But what and where was this Drome
Was Drome place was it thing was it human being or what was it
Such were some of the thoughts that came to me as stood there
But what good to wonder to ques tion when there could be no answer forthcoming
Sooner or later the answer would be ours
And in the meantime well more than sufficient unto the day was the mystery there of
And besides hadnt Rhodes and come to find mysteries
As suredly
And assuredly it was not likely that we would be disap pointed
This grave matter whatever it was decided the angel plunged in to detailed account of what had happened on the bridge
We thought that we followed her recital very closely so expressive were her ges tures
When she told how we had saved her from that frightful chasm she was interrupted by exclama tions all eyes were turned upon us and felt certain in that moment that we were indeed friends
Still heaven only knew what awaited us
Tt was well of course to be san guine but that did not mean that we should blink facts however vague and mysterious those facts might be
There was momentary pause
When she went on saw the angels lower lip begin to tremble and tears come into her eyes
She was de scribing the death of her demon her poor poor demon
Well as regards appearances must own that would greatly prefer that hideous apebat of hers to many bulldog that have seen
The others too looked distressed
And indeed have no doubt that we ourselves had we known all about demons would have been well at least troubled
Little did Milton and dream that the loss of that winged monster might entail upon our lit tle band the most serious conse quences
So however it was as we were soon to learn
When she had ended her account the angel turned to us forthwith and went through an earnest and re markable pantomime
She and the others awaited our answer with the most intense interest
But the only answer we could give her was that we did not understand
That panto mime had been wholly unintelligible to Milton Rhodes and myself
say wholly unintelligible we could see however that it had something to do with ourselves and something to do with something up above but everything else in it was an utter mystery
The angel went through it again more slowly moie carefully and more fully this time
But still we could not understand
Perhaps suggested she could tell us with paper and pencil
Not bad idea Bill Thereat Rhodes produced pencil and notebook
These he gave to the angel with sign that she put it down in the book
She regarded the pencil curiously for some moments tried it upon the paper and then with some difficulty and undoubted ly some pain what with her wound DROME ed wrist she began
Rhodes moved to her right side to her left
Yes there could be no mistaking that she had drawn the Tamahno wis Rocks
Then she drew crevasse and two figures plainly
Rhodes and myself going down into it
That was clear as the day
Then she put those figures that were Rhodes and into the tunnel and presto with wave of the hand she brought them down to that very spot where we were standing
Clear again lovely Sibyl
What next
More figures and more and more
and were they too coming down the tun nel
Yes atlast it all was plain at last we wise numskulls understood her
Were we alone
Rhodes made it clear to her that we were
But he did not stop there he proceeded to make it clear to her that tee only knew the secret
She was some time in understanding this but when she did understand it what look was that which passed across her lovely Sibylline features
Great heaven said to myself lies gone and done it now The look was one of joy the look of soul triumphant
In moment however it was gone her features were only lovely impassive
But the thoughts and the feelings which that strange look of hers had aroused were not gone
felt shudder pass to my heart
Of truth this woman was dreadful
glanced at Rhodes thought that even he looked grave and troubled
Well so thought might hebe
said nothing however until the angel had rejoined her companions
Then There can be not the slight est doubt that they look with great fear upon the coming of people from that world above world as mys terious suppose to them as this subterranean world of theirs is to us
And now that they know that they have the great secret also when they have you and me well Milton old tillicum think it will indeed be strange if either of us ever again casts shadow in the sun It may be so Bill he said soberly
did pot think of that when told her
Still who knows
Certainly not
It is possible in deed probable it seems to me that We may do them her Bill harsh injustice
sincerely hope so That grave look left his face and he smiled at me And besides Billy me lad maybe we won ever want to re turn to that world we have left that world so full of ignorance and yet so full of knowledge and science too that world so cruel and yet sometimes so strangely kind that world so full of hate and mad pas sion and yet with ideals and aspira tions so very noble and lofty
Yes who knows Bill
It is possible that we may not want to return Was it significant or was it puiely casual
could not decide
But Rhodes gaze was now on the angel
And whilst stood pondering she turned and signed to us that they stood in readiness to proceed
She raised hand and pointed down the cavern
in some subtle manner making it clear that she was pointing to something far very far away
Drome she said
Drome nodded Milton Rhodes
He turned to me
Ready Bill Ready told him
And so we started
Next months chapters describe veritable Dantes Inferno as the Dromans and Rhodes and Carter penetrate through weirdly flickering phos phorescent lights into region of strange and ter rible monsters which attack them
eheFETISHOFTHE WAXWORKS AUL DUPUY Frenchman and patriot more Yankee than the nativeborn since he took out naturalization papers wears the Brit ish flag in his buttonhole on Inde pendence Day
story hangs upon this the story of dead hero to whom the presence of Paul became an outrage and abomi nation
And it was Brodsky who saved Paul from his postmortem vengeance
The psychical investigations of Dr Ivan Brodsky and the marvel ous results which he had obtained in his warfare against the hosts of evil some of which have previously re counted had by this time made him known to large circle of those to whom such things as spiritual pos session are facts rather than theories
In hospitals in prisons wherever we find pain and sin congregated occult manifestations are commonplace of NOTE
This is the sixth of series of stories each complete in itself dealing with Dr Ivan Brodsky The Surgeon of Soule existence though fear of ridicule de bars the inmates from making any mention of them
It was in such in stitutions that Brodskys reputation spread broadcast
But there are prisons for the dead as well as the living as shall show
Neither Brodsky nor was greatly surprized when visitor entered his study one evening and implored his aid in the unraveling of mystery which had he was convinced super natural explanation
At least cant help thinking so myself sir said the man speaking fluently but with slight foreign accent
Al though am not believer in such things myself
Brodsky brows clouded that was the stock phrase that he detested
If you do not Believe in such things how dare you make the sug gestion that they exist he cried
Be honest with yourself and with me man or go elsewhere
Do you believe in them or do you not THE FETISH OF THE WAXWORKS Yes sir do replied our vis itor
But when one makes such an admission one is ridiculed it hard Humph
grunted the doctor
Go ahead with your story The visitor sat down and fingered his hat nervously
He was apparent ly man of the laboring class to judge from his appearance yet he showed signs of intelligence superior to that of most of his kind
could account for his mental disturbance only when he had finished his story
Im Frenchman by birth sir he began and Ive been seven years in this country
Dupuy is my name
Im naturalized citizen and proud of my adopted country
learned my trade in Paris it queer trade and theres not many throughout the whole world follows it so that it pays well especially as it requires certain amount of artistic ability though less than you would suppose
am maker of wax figures for the waxworks theater on Fifth Street
You may not know the place gentle men for people seem somehow to have lost interest in that form of en tertain ment though it used to be the craz vears gone by
My task is to model lifesize wax figures of all peo ple of ifrominence
Weve got the fa mous murderers of course and the presidents and the heroes of the revo lution and all the famous kings and queens of England the great soldiers and sailors Wellington Napoleon Nelson Fan gh
said the doctor
Let the dead rest in their graves
Dont you know that every time you set up an image of the dead you form focus in which all that remains of his personality on earth concentrates
That commandment against making replicas of life in stone which ould have included wax my friend had ax figures been known was the wisest and most spiritual of all
Go Well sir said our visitor as told you Im constantly at work fashioning these figures for Mr Mar gotson the proprietor
We didnt have any of naval officors up to few eeks ago
But Mr Margotson is al ways looking out for something new so he says to me Dupuy lets have few statues of naval officers of his torv
Do you remember any Sure said
Theres Ville neuve and St
Page and Quit talking French said Mr Margotson
What about John Paul Jones and Nelson So set to work and made repli cas of them
The one of Jones was fair but the Nelson statue was first rate did it all from his portraits and there he stands in the gallery with one arm and one eye and ev erybody who comes in recognizes him at once
And that brings me to the point
Ah youve had trouble with Nelson cried Brodsky
Mon Dku said Dupuy lapsing into his native tongue as he wiped his forehead hes trying to murder me The man broke off and eyed us fur tively
had long learned to keep guard over my face but incredulity was in my heart
As for the doctor he said nothing and the man con tinued It must have been eek ago that the first thing happened
was adjusting the scabbard of his sword we use real swords in our scab bards and the point flew through and went right into my wrist just missed large artery
He held his hand up for our in spection
There was ragged cut half healed along the base of the hand
And Ill swear that the figure pushed the sword through the scab bard pushed it violently for it cut clear through the leather
But didn catch on just then
Then four WEIRD TALES days afterward as was passing it the thing flew from its pedestal and keeled me over
My head just missed the iron radiator by two inches
And tell you it didnt fall it fairly threw itself at me
What does Mr Margotson say to that asked Brodsky
He laughs at me
dont know what to do
ve half mind to melt it and let Margotson discharge me and yet have my wife to think of and theres no demand for such men as me the business having fallen off so
And if stay there one day the thing will kill me Enough said Brodsky
Well go there at once
Can we get in have the key answered the Frenchman putting on his hat
Xe three left the house together
We caught car on the main road which ran past us one block away and half an hour later stepped out at the entrance to the waxworks theater which stood in what was now the heart of the busi ness section of the city and was in consequence almost completely de serted at this hour of the evening
Our companion pulled out key and opened side door
We went up to great hall round which were ranged statues of celebrities lifesize figures of strikingly human aspect
And yet mused Brodsky stop ping to regard group of cleverly arranged heroes of our civil war the men who erect these think they have nothing more than the external shells
How ignorant they are of the psychic qualities of their actions
In deed what da they dream of any thing beyond the material
Yet this gallery is almost breeding ground of souls
Who can measure what in fluences such beings draw down to them
Well at least no evil spirit would be attracted hither among these men who offered up their lives for their country Dupuy led the way toward an end of the great hall
Here saw group of figures attired in Georgian dress evidently Nelson would be found among these
One of them however seemed singularly incongru ous and out of place
It was short thickset man in the costume of mechanic of today
It seemed to move started then discovered that it was living man
Margotson cried Dupuy in confusion
But the proprietor seemed still more confused than his assistant
He came forward sheepishly and mask seemed to have descended upon his blank face and blotted out some curious emotions which had thought that read there
Margotson these are two gentlemen who are interested in what told you about the statue Dupuy stammered
Margotson face grew black with rage
Newspaper writers eh he shouted
Come to write up my museum suppose
dont want your advertising ve got all the cus tomers want and you cant do me no good
Damn your curiosity this fools been telling you some of his silly yarns about the Nelson statue suppose
This rage appeared so abnormal that my medical training induced me to examine Margotson from the pathological standpoint
But Brod sky looked into his face steadily and land his hand upon his shoulder
Margotson anger seemed suddenly to evaporate
Theyre only interested in the statues turning into flesh and blood sir said the Frenchman
Unluckily these words brought about return of Margotson frenzy
Flesh and blood
Rubbish he shouted
Arrant nonsense thats what youre talking Dupuy
Whats the matter with the statue
Its THE FETISH OF THE WAXWORKS very good statue one of the best youve made
Its new wax green wax we call it in the trade and it ought to have had time to mature only the public were so crazed over the naval officers that didnt have time to let it lie
Thats why its hardening because of the fumes from the leather factory across the street
They drift in here something terrible
Thats all thats the matter with it
Look He switched on an electric light upon the wall behind him and for the first time saw clearly the face of the great English hero
There were the irregular thin homely fea tures lit by flame of patriotic en thusiasm
Yet admirably as the artist had caught the inspiration of the painting from which he modeled it there seemed something more some hardly defined vein of cruelty of caprice that actually gave the face the property of seeming to re flect certain change of emotions an instability of mind as though the thing possessed some conscious life
And the skin surely that was the skin of man with the blood mantling in the flesh beneath
Du puy started back with wild cry
Look at him
swear never put that smile upon his face he screamed
Hes changing
Hes changing tell you
Lord preserve us all
Get rid of it Mr Margot son
If you hand me out any more of that nonsense Ill fire you on the spot shouted the enraged propri etor
Youre going daffy Dupuy thats whats the matter with you
Hes always had that smile
Exam ine the wax gentlemen its hard ened thats all With horror and repulsion laid my finger on the smooth surface of the cheek
So lifelike did it appear that could have sworn the blood faded out of the arterioles beneath the pressure blanching the surface of the skin And yet it was of wax
It was not flesh and blood
But flesh and blood differed less from it than it differed from the unreal and waxen figures around it
It stooped half for ward it seemed instinct with slowly dawning vitality
And surely its ex pression had changed it had not smiled thus with the cold malevo lence of conqueror when first had seen it
Then suddenly Margotson seemed transformed
As though he adapted his mood to suit his mind he burst into wild peal of laughter
Good old Nelson he shouted and the sounds echoed from the roof and rang through the hall while for one dreadful moment could have sworn that an answering emotion flitted across that waxen face
Good boy Nelson
miracle of art Du puy
cant tear myself away from watching him
Ill raise your sal ary
He makes me feel so good
He wants me to do something for him and Ill find out what it is and do it Youve given him body and he getting your reason my friend said Brodsky somewhat shaken by this unexpected outburst
Come away come away gentle men cried the Frenchman pulling us by the arms
Hes mad God help him
should have told you hed been acting queer but last night when he laughed at me so much
thought that it was only overwork
He as mad as loon
We did not need to be urged nor was there necessity of excuses
Mar gotson had already forgotten us and was standing before the statue alter nately capering and grimacing
Now Ill give you my advice and shortly you can follow it or not at your peril said Brodsky
Get your employer home in safety and then slip back and chop the thing to pieces before tragedy super venes
No thats all Ive got to say WEIRD TALES to you except just this give up your rade and learn something that wont ring you into conflict with all these vital forces that hang round such daces
And with these words he fairly turled himself out of the place leav ing me to follow him as best could
think mentioned once how sensitive the doctor always was to he morbid things of life
Perhaps it was certain sensibility to those in visible influences which accompany noods and invest those places where any violent emotions have been at play
At any rate having seen so nuch of the darker side of life Brod ky was strenuously insistent upon cleanliness and wholesomeness
Weve got to leave such tilings done and work in the sun he used say
This is our working day when the night comes at last may our good deeds be our protective armor igainst all the host of devils on the night shores that we shall pass hrough You believe we have to pass hrough some place of purgation asked
Well have to clean up some how in this life or the next he answered
We cant get into heav en with dirty fingernails So on this occasion forebore to question him when we got home
Brodsky went to closet where he kept many relics of his earlier life md came out with small Union Jack upon moldering staff
The flag of the vessel that bore me from Poland where the Czars missaries were seeking my life he aid sadly
To what better use can it be put Then he explained the mystery
It is fetish he said filling his tipe and puffing at it slowly
It is exactly similar in every particu lar to the idols of the West Africans or for that matter to any idol
The savage makes some dreadful idol to worship sacrifices to it until the thing becomes instinct with life and filled with all the passions of the worshipers then devil has been called into existence whose evil in fluence is incalculable
tell you it was no mythical devil that the early Christian missionaries had to face nor those of today
After death the pure spirit flies to its appointed resting place leaving its two bodies moldering behind it
One is that earthly body that we all know the other is the soul body the body of desires semiconscious force that survives for months or years according to the condition of the dead being
Do not mistake me this is not Nelson
That great admiral is un conscious of this replica of him there in the waxworks theater
It is group of emotions such as possessed Nelson man of strong feelings yet not necessarily his
The warm en thusiasm of the crowds that have vis ited that place have focused these emotions much as the burning glass focuses the rays of the sun
Remem ber as yet this creature is only half conscious
It vaguely as in dream feels this life within itself it is ris ing toward conscious existence
And that fool Margotson is the tool by which it means to wreak its en mity upon Dupuy But why does it hate the French man so much
Do you not recollect Nelsons motto
the doctor asked Hate Frenchman as you would the devil This elemental being that has attract ed these emotions that made up the great admirals soulbody has neces sarily the identical feeling
What does it know of the time that has elapsed or the changes of history
There is the Frenchman and it will have his life by itself if possible
If it can not kill him as it tried it will certainly do so th rough Margot THE FETISH QF THE WAXWORKS son
Well its none of ray business he added
ve warned Dupuy
And he went to bed while forgot to ask the purpose of the Union Jack which saw him stuff into his pocket
But knew that Brodsky could not dismiss his own responsibility so eas ily
He did not undress for from my room which adjoined his own heard him pacing the floor with short quick footsteps the greater portion of the night
fell asleep at last and had hard ly closed my eyes two minutes as it seemed before heard the front door bell jangled violently started up in bed filled with horrible presenti ments of evil and began to dress myself hurriedly
few moments later Brodsky tapped loudly upon my door
Dress yourself as quickly as you can he called
Theres work on foot for both of us before the morn ing As hurried on my clothes heard an agitated voice in the sitting room outside which had little difficulty in recognizing as that of the assist ant at the waxworks theater My judgment was correct when emerged found him seated in chair in condition of collapse and Brodsky standing over him hold ing glass of some stimulant to his lips
The doctor was fully dressed even to his hat and from his pocket there protruded small corner of the British flag
We went out together without any explanations
Luckily the cars ran at intervals and we reached the corner of the main street
We clambered in it was empty and during the ride learned in broken ejaculations from the man the cause of Iiis visit
He had halted irresolutely at the entrance to the waxworks theater after we left him
Then he retraced his steps determined to carry out the doctors instructions as soon as he could get Margotson away
He saw his employer standing before the statue regarding it silently
as though in trance
Dupuy crept up to him passing the statue of necessity upon the opposite side
And then he realized that Margotson had drawn the sword from the scabbard of the admiral and stood in such an attitude that Dupuy could neither advance nor retreat
At the same time he experienced return of that deathly faintness that had possessed him on previous oc casion as he described to us
As in trance he saw Margotson advance stealthily toward him while he re mained incapable of resistance then he recovered his senses and leaned aside as Margotson thrust
Running like the wind he gained the street outside and had presence of mind enough to lock the door behind him
But dont come in he insist ed as we gained the side door
No sir Ive seen enough for tonight
dont go in It took all Brodskys resolution to persuade Dupuy to come
Without his presence the doctor said he would be powerless
With him he might still break this spell and bring back Margotson to sanity
And at last very timidly Dupuy crept in behind the doctor
As Brodsky un locked the door the key fell from his fingers
The key
You must find it he cried to me
Under no circum stances may you follow us without it
To do so may be fatal
Remember And before had
time to answer saw him spring lightly up the stair way dragging the unwilling French man with him
My immediate im pulse was to dash after him then discipline came to my aid and stooped for the key
The night was dark and it was two minutes before found it
Then suddenly from within heard wild shouts and stampede
WEIRD TALES sprang up the stairs and along the hall running with sobbing breath and clenched fists till gained the end where saw shadows hovering
Frantically switched on an electric light
Then perceived Margotson his face aflame like madmans thrusting at Brodsky with the ad mirals sword while the doctor par ried him with admirable grace and ease
Dupuy came running up to me
He rushed at me he cried with his sword drawn and Dr Brod sky snatched sword from Paul Jones replica and met him
The doctor wins Like every Polish gentleman Brod sky was an adept with the foils
Cer tainly clumsy mechanic such as Margotson could not have expected to overcome him
Yet as watched the tense interchange of swordplay was amazed at the skill shown by Margotson
It seemed as though the courage and prowess of the great ad miral had descended upon him
Twice he lunged so fiercely that the point grazed Brodskys arm then with sudden twist he sent the weapon flying from the doctors hand and rushed not at him but straight toward Dupuy
So swift was the impetus he was upon us be fore we could stir
And then just as the blade seemed about to pierce the Frenchmans heart something came fluttering downwaid over his head and the sword fell from Mar gotson hand and he stood still his eyes fixed upon vacancy his body immobile while Dupuy released him self from the folds of the union jack that Brodsky had so admirably thrown over him
nd you think can go back to my job
asked Dupuy the next morning
By all means answered the doctor
Margotson will remember nothing whatever of his insanity
So youd better hurry up or he will want to know why you are late
You need not fear the statue
It ill have resumed its natural aspect and in case any remnants of its power re main keep small British flag in your buttonhole especially on holi days such as Independence Day
Yes thats your penalty Dupuy patriot as you say you are the only alter native being the destruction of the statue which Margotson wont al low
And when you can try to get another occupation
It was desperate chance con fided Brodsky to me afterward
Still one can deal with these ele mental forces much as the lunatics the mad impulse of national hatred was shattered instantly when it per ceived the flag of its country
When Margotson wakes up upon the floor of the gallery he will think that he got drunk tire night before But tell me cried suddenly why did you make me wait till found the key Then the solution came to me
You knew our lives were in danger and wished to save me from the possibility of injury cried
Pshaw muttered the doctor
Just accept facts and dont put sentimental interpretations upon them NOTE The Seventh Symphony the next story in this series will be published in Weird Tales next month
Ke CHURCH aRAEBR APPLEBY We pressed Sturl against the pipe and bound him tightly to it
THREW piece of string into the grate where presently it be gan to smolder
Kobyssu stopped talking and sniffed
Although in appearance he is ferocious with his little simian forehead his black bushes of eye brows and his big bristling mus tache he is in reality fellow of most pleasant even temperament
But it was plain that the string had disturbed him greatly
His cheek had paled and got glimpse of his eyes as he bent forward swiftly in his chair and leveled them at the hearth
The expression in them was twofold
There was deep anger there was equally deep horror
He saw the string snatched at it and cast it into the heart of the fire so that it flamed instantly
Pouf he said waving his hands in front of his nose and now exceedingly white
was amazed but
all said was Sorry didnt think the smell would worry you Kobyssu looked round his cafe de serted at this hour of the afternoon
He looked at the neat tables at the walls at his desk rather with the air of man who wished to assure him self that he was indeed in Wardour Street London and nowhere else
Then he faced the fire again his eyes more normal but very somber
That smell of slowburning hemp it reminded me of something in Czergona
But said you often tell me that every memory of your native country is dear to you
Only yester day you quoted some absurd prov erb To Czerg the howl of wolf in his homeland is more comforting than the lowing of his cattle in for eign land It is true proverb
My WEIRD TALES country may be merely what your newspapers say barren mountain range in midEurope but love ev ery memory of it except one
That is memory of dreadful things
There was table with coffee be tween our chairs
He filled my cup
From any country however great and refined one may get memory of dreadful things he said defending Czergona
Yet these were strangely dread ful He drew in his breath with long hiss staring broodingly at the sugarbowl
The odor of that string recalled to me the church stove at Raebrudafisk so suddenly so without warning that believed was back in the past and felt the feelings of twelve years ago
Ahh had shock
What about this stove
But par don Kobyssu perhaps it would pain you to tell me
Perhaps the matter is personal He shook his head
was not directly concerned am thankful to say
But the story is too fearful thing to relate idly over coffee
And you would be sorry if put it in your mind
You would strive to forget it and never forget it no no do not want to tell it But my curiosity had risen high
urged Kobyssu and he yielded
am punished
wish had not heard word of the tale of the church stove at Raebrudafisk which Kobyssu narrated in the fluent English that he has acquired so praiseworthily dur ing recent years
aebrudafisk he said is the village was born in
It is on hillside in fir wood
The church which is of stone is quarter of mile from it up the hill
When as little boy was taken to church by my parents the stove used to inter est me very much
It was not far from where we sat near the north wall
It was an upright iron cylinder about three feet high and two feet in diameter having flat top with flap at the edge of this which opened so that coal and wood could be poured in
stout pipe went from the stove right up to the roof and through it
In summer of course the stove was not lit
In winter it was attend ed to by old Uflio Vaang
He would start the fire some two hours before the morning service and why the stove interested me was this by the time entered the church the flat top would be glowing red with dazzling sparks appearing suddenly on it when specks of stuff fell there from the ceiling and the pipe would be red halfw ay to the roof brilliant red at the base duller the higher you looked yet hot you can imagine
was extremely fond of that stove especially at evening service when snow and darkness and wolves were outside the church
yearned to spend the night by it and thought pastor and people would be much more sensible to do so instead of far ing down the hill all in bunch for fear of the wolves
And was young rascal
got into the habit of flicking bits of string on to the stove to see them smoke and burst into flame
But thrashing from my father and another from the pastor cured me of that
There was good draft to that stove it had some bars low down in front
And old Uflio though every body warned him not to drenched the fuel with oil before lighting it
Stove and pipe were red long before church time
Kobyssu drank some coffee and made considerable pause
knew he was hoping that some customer would arrive and give him pretext for breaking off altogether
None came however so he shrugged his shoulders and proceeded
Old Uflio Vaang was wonderful
He was completely blind
He had THE CHURCH STOVE been blind since early manhood
With no difficulty he would find his own way to the church place his hand on anything he required and set the stove going
Dangerous work for blind man you will think eh
Yet he was known to be so careful that despite the matter of oil peo ple did not fear an accident
Uflio perception was uncanny
have noticed the stove fail trifle toward the end of morning service the top go from yellowscarlet to crimson and Uflio sensing the change has risen from his chair and tiptoed down the church and picked up small tongs and opened the flap gripping it at the first attempt and lump by lump not to make loud noise he has dropped coal into the redhot thing running no more peril of burn ing himself than would man with two healthy eyes
Well twelve years ago when was swineherd of twenty and had not commenced to think of London or even of Warsaw old Uflio was still tending the stove
Naturally had lost my boyish interest in it
never supposed that should be interested in it again
Kobyssu paused once more
When he resumed such note of sadness was in his voice that experienced chill dread and the first of my regrets at having importuned him for the story
had not reckoned on tragedy to young girl which perceived looming
Uflio Vaang had daughter said he Djira
She was sixteen pretty brightnatured oh delight ful
She was the old mans only child and ashis wife was dead all in the world he had to care for
was not in love with Djira
was think ing of girl in the next village
But the other young men of Raebrudafisk were in love with her as unhappily was man not young
That was Oik Sturl whose age was forty and who was often in prison for stealing or violence
He was sullen blackguard ordinarily when enraged he was the vilest of brutes
Of course his chance to win Djira the sweet fresh bud was hope less
But suppose he did not be lieve this until he waylaid her one afternoon far from our village
Then she must have convinced him
Would she had not poor child
poor little innocent
The truth infuriated him
He cut her throat there and then Kobyssu He did there and then said Kobyssu the deep anger in his eyes again and his teeth glinting under his mustache
He clenched his fist and shook it at the floor
He did he repeated and he did more
That the scent of much blood might bring the wolves who would hide his crime he stabbed he hacked her little pure body ahh Kobyssu blew out his breath and drummed his fingers agitatedly on his knees
So this was what the stove that Djira father tended reminded Kobyssu of
As it was fact not fic tion did not want to hear anything further
And yet felt must know what happened to the villain Sturl
said so and added in dismay Kobyssu
you dont have capital punishment in Czergona do you No he answered with pecu liar inflection of his voice
The wolves did not get Djira he went on
We young men of Raebrudafisk reached her first
For boy saw what Sturl did and ran to tell us
He ran for his life since Sturl had caught sight of him and was chasing him
Sturl could not overtake him and turned in another direction when he perceived the lad would gain the vil lage
Yes we went to Djira and then we and the men of the whole country side sought Sturl
Many among us vowed to slay him when we came up on him but the pastor and School master Wiec who was the magistrate WEIRD TALES of the district sternly forbade this
For over two weeks in wild weather of sleet and bitter winds we hunted vainly scouring woods climb ing to the niches in the mountain tops and even searching our coal mine to which we thought the pierc ing cold might have driven Sturl
We wondered how he obtained food and at every step we took amid the trees or up the rocks we expected to dis cover him dead from exposure
You can conceive and pity Uflio this while
consider that his lot was worse than Djiras
She the one earthly gladness of his blind life she the bright the gentle whose lips and hands caressed him so lovingly whose greeting woke him in the morning whose voice told him the hues of the sky and the promise of the garden she held by foul hand and slaughtered
That is what he had to think of
Small wonder that for days the torment made him almost insane and that our womenfolk could give him no consolation
The Sunday after the murder he did not go to the church being too ill and weak
On the following Thursday however when there was an evening service he took up his routine and the stove was glowing when we entered the church
It was sad indeed to look at Uflio in his usual seat but bent and tremulous with his cheeks so sunken and ghast ly that he was scarcely to be recog nized
Perhaps it was saddest to notice the coal smears and tiny gleam of oil on his hands when he raised them
Little Djira had al ways been most careful to wipe them for him ere service began
As said for over two weeks we searched for Sturl and we found not trace of him
Then at dawn one morning our village was roused by new alarm
The village of Phvamu four miles away where they find and store oil
was on fire
Schoolmaster Wioe wanted every man of us to hurry across and aid the Phvamu people
had broken my arm two days previously seeking Sturl
To witness the blaze howev er set out with the rest
My chirm Vavik Rista and dozen others took path which went by the church
Although it rose steeply we began to cover it at trot
We had gone hundred yards past the church when man his clothes fluttering in rags sprang out into the way in front of us sprang as if from his sleep and trying to run before either of his feet was well back on the ground he seemed to wrench one and fell
He was Sturl
Vavik and seveial more darting forward instantly reached him as he came to his knees and held him
Lend me knife said Vavik whom Djira had shown many indica tions of loving
But two or three cried No no what will the pastor and School master Wiee say Yet there were others who agreed with Vavik and it was long time before we could quiet them
And all this while Phyamu is burning and we are needed cried someone
He pointed to the thin strong ropes many were carrying to the scene of the fire
Tie the beast to tree until we come back
Wolves objected someone else
So much the better shouted Vavik
But voice suggested leaving Sturl in the church and thither we dragged him
We bound him meaning to let him lie on the floor
Seeing him gnash with his teeth at the ropes about him and knowing him to be so supple that he might stretch to and gnaw through some we gagged him very firmly so that though he was raging at us the sounds he made were but as the hiss of the wind THE CHURCH STOVE about the church
Then he
began to roll and to knock his head against the floor
We must make him fast to something said one of us
We stared around the church
There were no pillars there seemed nothing to lash Sturl to
And then Hrok Nalti the chairmaker pointed to the stove
Stand him on that
Tie him to the pipe We did so fetching ladder and high bench from the vestry
We pressed Sturl against the pipe and bound
him tightly to it and in hard spirit for which we might be forgiven we bound him more than was necessary
We swathed and swathed him with rope until nearly all was used
With the last length since he made an attempt to beat his head against the pipe we bound that also passing the rope thrice across his brow and round the pipe thus forcing the back of his skull immov ably against the iron
Then we hastened to Phyamu
You will have observed that have said we in all this
It is right that should as was of the party
But the work as not the sort for man with fractured arm so that throughout was an onlooker
Justi fiably or not find relief in the knowledge of this
We hastened said to Phyamu
Keeping together for no particu lar reason except that we arrived to gether late and telling none that we had captured Sturl because we were jeered at for our tardiness we start ed to roll casks of oil into safety
helped wdth one hand and time was passing when suddenly Hrok straightened his back and flung out his arms stiffly uttering queer gurgling groan
It is Sunday morning
he said
It took us not second to realize his meaning
We saw Sturl figure of rope stiff and upright like some strange soldier on the stove in the church at Raebrudafisk Sturl incap able of movement incapable of sound save such as the wdnd was making
We saw the church door slowdy open and Uflio stoneblind Uflio appear
We saw him go to the vestry and emerge wdth fagots paper and coal
We saw him arrange the fuel in the stove utterly unconscious of Sturl al though his fingers would approach to within few inches of the wretchs feet whenever he manipulated the flap at the top
We saw him bring bottle of oil from his pocket soak the fuel and light it
And then we felt the sensations of Sturl the terror which seized him as soon as he perceived hat was to come the leap oi hope which his heart would give hen Uflio hand came near him the frenzy of awful despair which beset him as he strained and strained to loosen limb or to shift the gag with his tongue
We felt the first slight warmth to the soles of the feet
We felt the pipe against the back of the head and the slow sure heating of the pipe
We saw and felt all these things in stantaneously as it were and far faster than we had run to Phyamu we ran from it toward our church all except Vavik who continued his work
No more said standing up
But Kobyssu really as in the past now
He did not hear me and in stead of walking out of earshot re mained dazed
was speedy of leg said Kobys su and though could swing only one arm led the way with Hrok
We were not certain what time it was we believed there was no chance of saving Sturl yet in case there might be we tore along
Our earli est glimpse of the church showed its smoke blowing from the ehimney
As to Sturl having been discovered well presently we made out Uflio WEIRD TALES sitting quietly by Djiras grave and the pastor and some of the women folk coming up through the firs from the village with no sign of excite ment
Still we ran ran through the churchyard ran to the church door
Hrok opened it and the hot air from inside met me
There was reek of smoldering hemp just like that of the string you allowed to smolder only much more powerful and fol lowing it was another reek Stop
yelled and shook Kobvssu roughly by the shoulder
Then sat down feeling indubitably faint
Youd better give me drink Kobyssu said
might have stood it in print but to hear yori tell it you who were wit ness And yet said when was re covering cant help referring to the matter once once only though
Something strikes me as curious
You said that Uflios perception was un canny
In that case consider it strange that palpitating human being should have been within six inches and he have no inkling of the fact
obyssu who had gone white again toward the finish of the tale had brought measure of brandy for himself and this he drained before replying
will tell you he said de tail that was seen only by Hrok and another who cut down the the re mains and by me for Hrok wiped the face very quickly
For number of years Sturl had borne on his left cheek scar large puck ered scar that stood out from the rest of the flesh
Sturl face when Ilrok lowered him was wrought on by the heat yet some peculiar marks were still visible on the left cheek
They were littl stripes apparently mingling oil and coal dust such as might have been made by fingers of let us say blind ron who sought by feeling for the sear to satisfy himself as to the identity of the man he had discovered on the stove
THE DEATH CELL By SAMUEL SARGENT JR Its lonesome here in the dawning Sitting behind the bars Watching gray moon and gray sky And gray galactic stars
Tts lonesome waiting for footsteps Coming along the row Lonesomer than it ever was The morning Im to go
The scaffolds standing and ready The hammer quit last noon
And here am with the gray stars And gray sky and gray moon
can not express my feelings Here in this cursed room Listening to catch the footstep That sounds my coming doom
can not express my feelings Words couldnt tell them all
In this gray room in this gray dawn Shadowed by this gray wall
Its lonesome here in the dawning Sitting behind the bars Watching gray moon and gray sky And the Galaxys gray stars
Her scream changed to moan of agony teHL BASSETT MORGAN BOUT the stilt legs of the nipa thatched hut Paul Dakens jL JL looked down into lagoon so clear that he could see the little painted fish scattering like sparks
Behind him in the hut the little brown wife of Phillips mourned her husband whose funeral orgies were already in progress with prodigal ity of feasting and ceremony accord ed white man by the Papuan blacks who had murdered him
Dakens glanced at the woman huddled on the mats
At the head of the couch Phillips pet monkey blinked solemn ly as if he understood that his mas ter would never return and felt the fear which Dakens shared of those drums already tearing the forest gloom to tatters
The untimely death of Phillips had left unfinished that work he had planned with Dakens help of giving to the world their understanding of the natives unless Dakens went on and he was afraid
The blacks who feared the magic tricks of Phillips more than the sorcery of their own magician had none of that respect for Dakens
In his heart he knew that he would in all probability be taken and tortured
Phillips little brown wife had warned him had even offered to guide him through the tortuous lanes of jungle trees bedded in black water rank with the smell of walkabout grounds of crocodiles yet in her eyes limpid and dark as dew in the heart of black orchid he had read hate and desire for vengeance toward Gwanoo the chieftain whom Phillips had outwitted of bride when he took the girl to his own hut
week before Phillips had gone with Gwanoo on pigsticking expe dition
Three days or rather nights later Dakens had been wakened by the brown girls Song of Mourning nor could he laugh aside her fears
On the following morning Gwanoo re turned seated himself on the edge of this lagoon and beheaded Phillips body preparing the head as decora WEIRD TALES tive addition to his already fine col lection
Powerless to prevent Dakens had been ill over it enduring three days of racking fear while the brown wo man kept guard and he slept to dream of the head of his friend the red hair and bushy red beard
He wakened frenzied and hysteric each time and the brown woman plied him with palm wine mistaken kindness as he knew
Drink had the effect on Dakens of leaving his body and flesh cold his brain alert and afire and the skill of the surgeon he had once been al ways turned him to his case of knives
Behind his eyelids for three days and nights the head of Phillips seemed urging him to vengeance not to glut cruelty Phillips was too fine man for that but that the fear of the white man might once more make it safe for Dakens to stay on the lagoon and finish the notes for which both men had already sacrificed years
Palm wine fermenting daily had not quieted his fear but it dulled his power to fight that mad dream of cur ing the head of Gwanoo as he had mummied the head of Phillips
The brown woman little dreaming the peril she loosed wakened and carried the jar of wine to Dakens
He tilted back his head and drank thirstily
The monkey swung across the hut and crouched at his knees one small black paw on his wrist
Dakens pat ted its head then pouring wine in his palm he let it drink
He heard the soft cry of protest from the woman and in sheer perversity gave the little beast second drink of wine
In few minutes it was swinging all over the hut then back to his lap where he caught and held it staring into its beady little eyes and strange ly enough his gaze held the creature and between their eyes shone the dancing head of Phillips
If had your agility said Da kens whimsically Id get it The brown woman called the mon key in vain and she scolded Dakens in quick angry native words
He had forgotten that she was jealous of the friendship between him and Phillips forgotten that she was comely lit tle primitive whose lovely brown body shaped to feet with great pre hensile toes not unlike those of the monkey
She was griefstricken as only primitive can be and he real ized moment later that in her re sentment at his giving wine to the beast she had suddenly cast off any feeling of allegiance for him
moment later she snatched the monkey and plunged into the lagoon and was swimming through the clear water toward shore
Dakens smiled
Watching her brown body sleek and smooth as satin in the sungreen water he was conscious only of its symmetry the pleasing unity of mus cular strength and the fact that she was running true to type daughter of the jungle going back
She would he supposed return to Gwanoo but he thought his own chances of escape vrere better than her chance for life if the sorcerer took her
For her own sake Dakens wished she had not gone but the palm wine had cured him of the clutch and bite and twist of fear
He felt aloof primed for contempla tive interest in forthcoming events knowing that if the black men stormed the hut he had his own gun and need not endure torture
The girl had reached shore
There she stood on strip of dazzling white coral beach shining in brown loveli ness against mass of creamy hibis cus the heartsearching perfume of which came to his nostrils with the seatang
The monkey was in her arms and she whispered with red lips against its cheek caressing it with brown hands
And at that moment the jungle drums pulsed quick staccato probed his brain with hot fingers of sound
THE HEAD he heat and wine had made Da kens drowsy and again he wished the girl had not gone
He dared not sleep without her keeping guard
He was afraid of this somnol ence caressing his flesh stroking with languorous touch the strength from his body
The repeated drafts were hitting violently and presently ho rose found his case of surgical knives and began polishing them forcing his mind to memories of operations he had accomplished in days gone by
Tli on as he turned his gaze toward the shore whence came the palpitant drumming quivering louder and fast er as the funeral orgies got under way he saw patch of sunlight pierc ing tree branches and falling in cir cle of gold on the lagoon
In it lit tle fish swarmed to snap at insects and Dakens seemed to see again the head of Phillips only now the eyes were open imploring urging him to action
He tried to fathom the mean ing conscious that it was madness spot of sunlit water alive with gaudy fish but the fantasy persisted
He went to the door still staring brushing his hand across his eyes and as wind stirred the palms the spot of light shifted toward shore and following it he saw shining topaz gleam in the jungle the fire where hate and superstition danced in black ghoul shapes about the bier of the dead white man
He heard the song savage sound of broken irri tating rhythm song so old
that not even the singers understood its full significance song that went with shoreless rivers and jungle trees root ed in black water stirred by scaled horrors with gaping jaws
The brown girl was gone
Dakens shuddered to think what might be happening unless her comeliness earned merciful death
He turned again to the spot on the lagoon but the sun had moved and the water was in shadow the little fish flutter ing like scattered stars in cool green sky
Then the drumbeating was abrupt ly broken and wild outcry ended the song
Two Paradise birds danc ing in the tops of tall trees flew away from some disturbance
Dakens for got his fear
He was staring at the head of Phillips hanging from small black paw in clump of dark foliage its luxurious beard stirred by the wind its lips tightsewn but seemingly puckered in grim smile as if their owner enjoyed the joke he had found beyond the shore of life
Dakens wanted to laugh with the head
The monkey which had loved Phillips had stolen his head from the funeral wreaths of the village and swung through the trees
It leaped down from the branches and the brown girl sprang up from her hiding place to catch it in her arms
There was the sharp zzzz of an ar row and cluster of falling flowers
The girl swayed moment then caught the monkey and raced to the lagoon and was swimming
She as almost to the hut when the jungle belched black men
Dakens snatched his gun and fired
savage whirled and fell his lips at the lagoon rip ples
The girl was swimming under water brown undulating power which Dakens longed to watch and dared not
second and third shot cracked and the black men halted reluctant to change so soon their feast of flesh to an outflow of souls
The brown girl reached the hut and swarmed wdth incredible swiftness to its door while the blacks chattered in consultation on shore
Dakens felt wild elation at the crisis hurled upon him
This was better than brooding in the hut wait ing for death
The girl was crooning over the monkey which whined in small squeaky voice and caressing the head of Phillips but Dakens saw blood on her lips and knew she was WEIRD TALES wounded and presently the head oiled from her grasp to the mats and lay grinning at Dakens through tightsewn lips as if it assured him that he was doing well
He would have given year of life if he had the hope of so much to fathom the smile of those dead lips and guess what they would have ad vised
He was conscious of urging Phillips to tell him what to do
He could not withstand siege of the hut
Sooner or later they would rash him and he needed time and bullets for the woman and himself
grim respect for her courage thrilled him part of his elation over the stand he made
She deserved heroic end shot that would send her soul to seek Phillips who was waiting
Da kens felt the presence of his friend
The head was no longer horrid it was as if Phillips had come back
Then on shore the mass of blacks paited and Gwanoo stood on the cor al magnificent black giant strong white teeth flashing his headdress surmounted with swaying plumes of Paradise scarlet flowers encircling his oiled body
And Gwanoo boomed his parley
He demanded the head if that were returned he would take his men away to the feast
If it were not The murmur of the brown girls voice translated the promise of hor ror the death by ants by palm fiber by slicing slowly by being taken on lie crocodile walkabout grounds
Dakens licked his dry lips
His mind called demanded of Phillips how he should act if he must send on he girl Phillips had loved and fol low her and leave the notes garnered at such cost to molder in the hut
Its your job Phillips he heard himself whispering you would trust Gwanoo and he killed you
You trusted me and dont know what to do Phillips He was scarcely conscious that he spoke until the brown girl crept to his feet and murmured Kill Gwa noo Marster kill Gwanoo as he killed my white man She had seized his gun and there was sharp volley of shots dozen leaping black men and three inert bodies across the twisting splendor that had been Gwanoo then the others fled
Dakens turned and seized the gourd and throwing back his head emptied the wine in great gasping gurgles down his own throat
He needed it
The respite would be brief
Under cover of darkness they would return
But the moment the black men wore in the jungle the girl was in the lagoon
Dakens saw her swimming back slowly weighted by the body of the sorcerer which she hauled up the steps and dragged in the door then she touched Dakens arm and pointed
Gwanoo still lived
In the girls eyes was gleam of triumph
Hating Gwanoo as she did for the murder of her white man she showed the lust and greed of the primitive she was at this chance of inflicting on an enemy the torture she had seen him visit on others
Da kens saw her daxt to the case of knives and seizing the largest sit on the floor and whet its blade on the sole of her foot then leaning toward the inert Gwanoo she lifted the knife
Dakens leaped and caught hei wrist
She was like tiger in his grasp and only that she had been hurt he could not have kept her from murder
She twisted with uixbeliev able strength and in the end turned her ferocity on him
He never knew how it happened but as she writhed and bit at him with her teeth there came cry and she went limp the knifeblade thrust deep in her abdo men
Her scream changed to moan of agony
Blood spurted oxi his hands and he staggered with her to the heaped mats where the little monkey huddled nursing the head of Phillips
THE HEAD rom that moment Dakens lost track of events
The wine the strain of the last three days and nights the frenzied elation of killing and the sight of the
lifeblood of the brown girl spilled on the couch combined to wrest reason from its throne
He went temporarily mad with cool deadly insanity that turned from the stunned Gwanoo to the dying woman
Between them lay his case of knives
little beyond were other precious things among them the highly prized jars of ether and chloroform
He worked with mad frenzy and dextrous surety of skill
The monkey fled to the farthest comer of the hut and hid
The whimpering of the lit tle beast was the only audible sound through the afternoon
Then the fumes of palm wine left him and tho ether cleared in the wind that comes at sunset and Dakens saw and real ized the work of his hands and he wanted to imitate the monkey crouch in utter darkness and hide
Yet with night would come the horde of death from the jungle and having endured so much he wanted to make last stand sell as dearly as he could the life of the man now roused from the mists of drink that had turned him madman
Why he did not then turn the gun on Gwanoo he never knew
It might have been that the monkey crept presently from the shadow and came close to Gwanoo body reaching small black paw to touch the face of the black sorcerer
The little brown girl was dead her body wrapped in the mats but the stalwart Gwanoo showed signs of life
One black hand with its heavy wristlets was lifted to the bandage about the brows
Hear ing moan the monkey crept close and the fumbling hand found and fondled the little beast which snug gled in the curve of Gwanoo arm
Dakens sat at the door of the hut more alert than at any time since Phillips death and he tried to re member what he had done
The ac tions of the monkey puzzled him
It had been fond of the brown girl and Phillips never very friendly with Dakens yet it clung to the body of the savage sorcerer
Dakens mar veled at himself wondering why he had extracted the bullet from Gwa noo brain
It lay on the table be side welter of something that he would not look at now that he was sober
For he had been very drunk
His hands his body and brain had been controlled by the demon which drink roused demon this time that was that redhaired redbearded head on the mats
Dakens reached out and took it on his knees
What was it that you made me do Phillips he demanded of it
Why did you return from that bourne youve reached and take the girl with you
He realized that he talked like maniac but he could not stop
Was it for love of her the faith ful little brown beauty or jealousy of me
You need not have feared that
Theres white girl in white mans land waiting for me and now cant go back His voice broke
cant go back with bloodguilty hands
Phillips didnt deserve this treachery
came with you stayed with you
If only you had not gone hunting with Gwanoo wed have come out of this and gained hon or
We had accomplished much we had sacrificed these years and our own honorable careers to catalogue these devils and now youve spoiled the chance of ever giving the results of that research to the world as said you would do when you took the girl first The sun dropping behind the dark line of palms cast shadow over the lagoon
The thunderous sunset of Papua seemed to growl about its soft pantherhide of forest
In the jungle the drums were beating up the tempo WEIRD TALES of that old song and Dakens was swept on that rhythm to an interlude in which the years of their lives in the jungle unfolded before his eyes and standing out from those het steaming months was the affection of Phillips for the brown girl
He saw it now as the one fatal mistake which would eventually destroy all they had done
Phillips had been mad about her
Dying he would not rest until she was winging her way to his side
Dakens came to believe it in that hour
The will of the dead man had taken tortuous way to manifest its power but it was tangible audible as real to Dakens as the breath on his lips
Reason had no power to refute the thing
He no longer fought the thought
His whole body his men tality felt the will of Phillips urging him to some task yet unfinished
Then as if answering the question twisting Dakens mind the voice of Gwanoo murmured Water Mar ster water Dakens leaped to his feet
This was no booming sound from the great throat of the sorcerer but womans murmur the crooning words of the brown girl
He reached for the gourd of boiled and cooled water and held it to the thick lips
The eyes beneath the head bandage opened and it seemed to Dakens they had the same soft sheen as the girls eyes the look of dew in the heart of black orchid
Take me
my people
my jungle it murmured again and again
Dakens shook himself brushed his hand over his face pinched the flesh of his arms
Stumbling from the restless movements of the reviving Gwanoo his foot touched the head of Phillips and snatching it up he would have placed it on the table but the hands of Gwanoo reached and drew it beside him
The monkey roused and caught its claws in the red beard Dakens threw up hand to his lips to throttle the scream in his throat
The shadows deepened
The black Papuan hills smoked against the fu rious crimson and amber of the sky
In another few minutes the light would die and night descend night and the batwinged fear that had held him prisoner for days worse fear than before be cause the hut held unbelievable horror the body of the brown girl in the mats and the great Gwanoo now reviving rapidly call ing incessantly for water hugging the monkey and the head to its breast
That voice had power to bring Dakens with the gourd and the last of his precious brandy mixed with water
It was as if he fed magic to one of those flowers which Hindoo fakirs raise from seed to bud and bloom in the space of few minutes
It was like Gwanoo own magic that plucked an orchid from the air and had it turn to snake
The sorcerer grew strong beyond belief
With staring eyes Dakens saw him lean on one arm then sit upright still caress ing the monkey and the head and the affection of the little animal was the most curious thing of all
Dakens felt as if he were caught in night mare
Then he was aware of the accelera tion of the jungle song and drums
They were coming through the jun gle coming through the night com ing to the lagoon and they came for him
His scalp prickled
He stood at the hut doorwav dreading the darkness that held Gwanoo and the head clutching mentally at the luminence of starlight on the lagoon water
He saw the blacks emerge thicker shadow in the gloom saw torches bloom and fire flash on knives and wreaths of white hibiscus splotched by scarlet flowers that looked like dried blood
The torch THE HEAD flare showed their betelstained teeth the bracelets of bone and metal the quivering headplumes
It was of no use to shoot at that mass better to reserve his bullets and strength for their rush
He kept his revolver so that he might thrust it at any moment in his mouth and fire
Too late he wished he had dickered with Gwanoo to have the notes that he and Phillips had made sent out to port
Now they would be as much wasted as his life
The savages were in the lagoon water
On shore they had heaped their torches and the blaze lighted the clear depths where little fish flashed in scaled gold
Da kens turned to the darkness of the hut and lifted the revolver
It touched his chin and crept toward his lips
His scream startled the swimmers
From behind him the great arms of Gwanoo caught and pinioned his wrists to his sides
He saw the torch flare from shore shining on the black face under the startling white gauze bandages saw the soft dark eyes shining heard the voice gentle as that of woman Not kill Marster
live an go out
Frantic frenzied Dakens twisted in that grasp
Then the hut was filled with savages and the voice of Gwanoo booming with its old strength commanded his warriors
Dakens was held in the grip of sav ages while Gwanoo leaning heavily on the shoulder of two black men looked down at an uncovered dead girl on the mats
Dakens saw
His heart pounded in his throat as he ap praised the work of his hands the neat surgery the delicate line of stitches under her hair
What what in heavens name had he done that day
Far far away memory throbbed tapped rustled sheaf of pictures experiments at college transplanting the brains of one dog to the head of another he had shQwn skill at that His eyes turned to the table where Gwanoo was lifting and dropping his surgical instruments into the black case closing it and gesturing to one of his men to carry it
Something else lay there
Dakens saw with surgeons interest paramount the brain of Gwanoo
He knew at least he felt the knowledge of what he had done for his mind was dragged over trail without his own volition
He was scarcely aware that they swung him to their shoulders and swam with him through the lagoon
He saw on shore the giant Gwanoo still leaning on the shoulders of his men but with the head of Phillips clutched in one arm and the monkey perched on shoulder beside the bandaged head of the sorcerer
Then for Dakens the lights went out
wakened in hut
Dawn poured its soft light through the doorway
soft murmur of women voices droned through his dreams
The Jungle song was stilled the drums silent
He heard the tinkle of shells fringing the hut of chieftain stirred by the wind
The perfume of ylangylang wafted to his nos trils
Rousing himself Dakens saw women weaving flower garlands in the soft green shade of Jungle clear ing and among them sat Gwanoo but Gwanoo subtly changed from the savage sorcerer whose look had power to waken fear
Gwanoo played with flowers
The little monkey sat on his knee
He leaned against tree bole and above his flower and Paradiseplumed hair in reath of fresh garlands hung Phillips head
Dakens looked about the hut saw his case of surgical instruments and the black metal box wrapped in oil skin which held his notes
Then he tried to recall the nights in the hut the horror of the last day and looked again at Gwanoo
The gauze band age was gone
There was scar across the broad forehead disappear WEIRD TALES ing into the hair
The eyes were not those piercing beadlike jets
The voice held the soft womantone
Dakens sat up and his movement brought woman into the hut
moment later she had summoned Gwanoo who entered and sat cross legged beside Dakens and handed him the box of notes
Marster you sleep long time
One two ree moons you sleep
Now you go out Go out
Light leaped in Dakens eyes warmth flooded his heart
Gwa noo had given him lease of life of mercy of hope
They fed him
The women mas saged his body with lemonscented oil as they had done for many days
They imparted the strength of their hands to his flesh and healed him
Gwanoo kept guard Gwanoo changed Gwanoo womangentle
The village of nipathatched huts was strangely devoid of men
He learned from their talk that the war riors were hunting the contraband Paradise plumes and would be gone many days and that he was to be sent out before their return
Dakens had lain for three months bereft of reason nursed by the commands of Gwanoo and at last he understood
Gwanoo brain was left in the la goon hut
The brain of the brown girl inhabited the head of the sorcer er
Yet before he left Dakens car ried the case of knives that were the instruments of this magic to where long war canoe nosed the black shadowed lianas looped above the jungle stream and dropped it into the depths
Never again would he use his surgeons skill for very fear of its cunning
Returning he stood before the head of Phillips and saluted
He spoke not word
The tightsewn lips still grinned at the joke of it all
Dakens had one regret as he stepped into the canoe and looked for the last time on the magnificent Gwa noo with the soft eyes of the bride of Phillips that he would never know how the thing would end whether the warrior body of the sorcerer would in time absorb the woman brain or the woman weaken the war rior
It seemed pity he could not watch that phase but in white mans land white girl waited and there were the notes to work on and give to the world the most interest ing of which could not be included in precise and scholarly treatise such as he and Phillips had planned
The paddles dipped
The throats of black men took up the jungle song and floating under the dark trees Dakens looked his last at the grinning tightsewn lips of his friend of Phil lips who had engineered so curiously the release of Dakens
Ahead the dark water stirred and crocodile rose and opened wide jaws and showed its curved wicked fangs but Dakens only smiled
Nothing had power to startle him now
He had come through surer deaths guarded and protected by greater power than his owm with keener cunning and more subtle wit
It was like the Phillips he had known
Phillips would have loved to tell such tale
In the memory of Dakens he would always be grin ning tightlipped flowerwreathed greatly prized head
Short Tale About an Egyptian Magician The Unearthly By DON ROBERT CATLIN IM HOWARD was astonished at what his friend had proposed to do and attempted to put him right
See here Jerry can tell you that youll only be making fool of yourself
happened to be present at that affair at the Crawfords and saw the thing with my own eyes
It may as you say be unearthly but saw it Jerry Newman laughed at his friends fears
You think you saw it he said ironically
Howard shrugged expressively
Then if cant dissuade you suppose may as well accede to your request
Thursday night voir said Jerry nodded shortly
Ive heard so blooming much about that Egyptians prowess that am deter mined to put an end to his fame once and for all
met him the other day and as have already told you told him to his face that he was faker of the worst kind and that without his preparations made he couldnt duplicate his feat
In other words that in room selected by my self and at time named by me he could not do what he did at the Craw fords
And wagered an even five thousand dollars that he would fail under the conditions have named Howards face showed his concern
Thats going bit strong Jerry
Laugh if you wish but tell you that saw the thing with my own eyes and was looking for flaws at the time
The Egyptian Mohamet Ali will most certainly win your five thousand Jerry Newman waved his friends objections aside
Your arguments are beside the matter at hand he said
Youve given me permission to use your studio next Thursday night and shall inform Mohamet Ali only at the last minute of the scene of his performance which will make it virtually impossible for him to arrange any properties or stage ef fects
It is my contention that with out any prearrangements the Egyp tian will fail The other shrugged again as though to wash his hands of the mat ter
He had seen Mohamet Ali hursday evening came and with the darkening of the skies group of Jerry Newmans closest friends gathered in Howards studio
Some of them had like Jim Howard been present at the demonstration at the Crawfords and all of them were cer tain that their friend was to lose his wager
Ones eyes do not lie you know what one had seen one had seen
few minutes after the last of the group had arrived the door opened to admit Newman closely following him came the Egyptian lean swarthy yet rather handsomelooking fellow for all his swarthiness
At the Egyptians heels trotted an urchin who was quite evidently either an Egyptian as was Mohamet Ali or an Arab
WEIRD TALES think that you have met most of these gentlemen said Jerry in dicating the small gathering
Ive asked them to be present as wit nesses
Quite naturally one would wish witnesses murmured Mohamet Ali politely smile touching his mouth
Jerry Newman bowed
Billy Weaver is the stakeholder as you know and the wager is to be paid im mediately upon satisfactory or pardon me unsatisfactory conclu sion of your feat And now we may as well The Egyptian bowed
At your convenience sirs he said
If you will arrange yourselves The group gathered in semicircle
And then as the Egyptian drew the urchin close to him and advanced to the center of the improvised stage an almost blindingly intense bluewhite light illuminated the room
From overhead came soft fluttering faint hissing as the huge Cooper Hewitt photographic lights settled down to steady glare Pardon me for not informing you that the lights were to be turned on Mohamet Ali Jerry Newman spoke up
Id almost forgotten them
You see he went on disarmingly the room is quite gloomy and well you are quite aware of the fact that am looking for trickery on your part
This studio you see belongs to friend Howard who is photo graphic illustrator for several maga zines and the CooperHewitts are used to light his sets
As you may see for yourself they illuminate every nook and corner of the studio and well tonight your every move will be clearly visible As you will the Egyptian ac ceded smilingly
From somewhere about his person he drew short uglylooking sword and small ball of twine
The sword he laid upon the floor
Now gentlemen if you will follow me closely With the words he grasped the end of the twine and tossed the ball up ward quickly
gasp went up from the little audience as they saw the twine seemingly vanish through one of the great skylights
indeed the skylight seemed to have vanished for they could see out into the heavens
Overhead the rolling evening clouds passed in stately array and into them the twine disappeared
At word from the Egyptian the small boy clutched the twine in his hands and began climbing upward
The astonished Jerry gazed open mouthed as the urchin wriggled and squirmed his way up that twine continuing on until he too was swept from sight by the lowhanging clouds
Mohamet Ali stood at the base of that slender ladder to the heavens
After moment he called out Come down
The twine wiggled bit as though the urchin had commenced his down ward flight then all movement ceased
Mohamet Ali was incensed
Come dovm
he shouted
Come down
He listened intently as if for an an swer
None came
Frowning fero ciously quite obviously enraged at the boys refusal to obey him the Egyptian stoopefl and seized the sword
Spawn of Shaitan he snarled grasping the twine in his brown hands
And then he too climbed up ward
Chin sagging Jerry Newsman watched the Egyptian follow the ur chin into the clouds
Then the twine began to sway to and fro violently
From above came eird shrieks shrill implorings for mercy then they were drowned out by the lover tones of the Egyptians voice snarling vicious
An unearthly scream split asunder the silence in the room below scream that set on edge each nerve in the bodies of the watchers
THE UNEARTHLY Drops of blood spattered on the carpet and moment later an arm fell thudding to the floor
It was small slender darkskinned
It was the urchin arm
Followed another cry and the other arm struck sickeningly beside the first Then before the horrified eyes of the beholders in quick suc cession they saw the urchins feet his dismembered legs his head and then the bloody torso striking before them
Then from above Mohamet Ali came slipping down the twine
He landed lightly on his feet beside the horrible disarray
He would not obey me he said simply as he glanced about him upon the gathering
As if that ended the matter he ex tended his foot and kicked the dis membered body into pile
The twine he grasped and giving it jerk so that it fell into his hands rolled it up compactly
Then glancing about he seized large rug from the floor and quickly threw the severed pieces of the body into it
Gathering the four corners he lifted the horrible burden and thmv it at the feet of the men who were watching him
The rug thudded on the floor un folded and the urchin miraculously made whole again leaped lightly to his feet and salaamed deeply
That is all think Mohamet Ali said easily
chorus of told you sos dinned into Jerry Newmans ears
You wouldnt believe Jerry and its cost you exactly five thou sand dollars sly grin touched Jerrys lips
havent lost as yet he said slowly
The Egyptian brows lifted
Did you not see with your own eyes sir Newman nodded
Quite right Mohamet Ali
did see with my own eyes but my eyes are not infallible you know and so brought along an eye with me that doesn lie
TIo smiled into the astounded faces of the little group
All right Harrison he called loudly
door at the farther end of the room opened and wiry cigarette smoking individual stalked into the room
In his hands he held square black wooden box perhaps six inches across
Ive seen some wild things Mr Newman in my line of work but this thing tonight surely had me going for while he grinned
Turning to the scowling Mohamet Ali Jerry New man explained This gentleman is Mr Harrison one of the WorldWide Newsreel motionpic ture cameramen
obtained his serv ices for the evening with an idea in view to photograph your every action
Perhaps now youll comprehend my reason for choosing Howards studio with its CooperHewitt photo graphic lights
Mr Harrison has been shooting your feat through small hole in the wall from the ad joining room
And if as believe your demonstration has been fake the truthtelling cameraeye will prove it
Ill have this roll of film developed tonight and printed and in the morning well run the picture in some projection room
Perhaps Mohamet Ali you will think that have taken advantage of you but warned you that was thorough skeptic and you should have been on guard
And now think there is nothing more until we gather tomor row morning to witness what Mr Harrison has filmed The Egyptian smiled charmingly
No apologies necessary assure you Mr Newman
One doesnt re linquish five thousand dollars without having as you Westerners say run for his money He beamed upon the motionpicture cameraman
And you Mr Harrison in that little WEIRD TALES black box yon hold an absolute proof of exactly every move my assistant and myself have made
Quite re markable The Egyptian took the little black box into his hands
Idly curious in manner he carried it to the nearest light as if to survey it more closely
And somehow his foot caught in rug and he stumbled
The black box fell with erash to the floor and creamywhite roll of film cascaded profusely from its con fines
Really Mohamet Ali gasped must apologize for my clumsiness He stooped as though to gather up the film
That stuffs no good now shouted the cameraman
The light has ruined it How terribly awkward of me murmured the Egyptian
Billy Weaver left the group and facing Mohamet Ali and Jerry New man waved two certified checks
Whatll do with these now he queried
Jerry Newmans face was mask as he bowed to the Egyptian
Give them to Mohamet Ali he said evenly and presently he was watching magician an assistant one sword and two certified ehecks for five thousand dollars each vanish ing through the doorway
MEG MERRILIES By JOHN KEATS Reprint Old Meg she was gipsy And lived upon the moors Her bed it was the brown heath turf And her house was out of doors
Her apples were swart blackberries Her currants pods broom Her wine was dew of the wild white rose Her book churchyard tomb
Her brothers were the craggy hills
Her sisters larehen trees Alone with her great family She lived as she did please
No breakfast had she many morn No dinner many noon And stead of supper she would stare Full hard against the moon
But every mom of woodbine fresh She made her garlanding And every night the dark glen yew She wove and she would sing
And with her fingers old and brown She plaited mats rushes And gave them to the cottagers She met among the bushes
Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen And tall as Amazon An old red blanket cloak she wore chip hat had she on
God rest her aged bones somewhere She died full long agone
SKULLS Bullets had failed and was at the mercy of those leering horrors STOOD looking back at the lit tle village of Kraanstaadt
From the height it looked more than ever like fairytale village with its high peaked roofs and winding streets of stones
Even for that pic turesque land of the Hartz Moun tains it was delightful very mas terpiece and the grim old castle that brooded in silence over it might well have housed an ogre or some sleep ing princess
Strange little land of fairytale
The very place that gave rise to so many stories of the little people living in its same tenor of ways and filled with ancient customs that made one instinctively gaze into the sky for winged dragons flying carpets or even witches on broomsticks
The people were as superstitious as ever was mortal race
They had begged me not to tramp the road to Kraanstaadt and had held up their hands in horror over my insisting on taking the trail through the woods
No no mine host of the tavern had cried be not so foolish for the woods are filled with awful things
And his wife dear old soul had clung to my arm with tears
But was not to be turned from my course of action
The walk would take the better part of day in the deep woods and give me even better appetite than already possessed
Besides this was the land of ro mance and for one was not to be cheated of that
To their arguments therefore turned deaf ear and prepared to go
The good wife final ly pressed upon me crucifix and in order not to hurt her feelings put its cord about my neck and the cross buttoned under my shirt
could feel it theie now and what was more to my liking could also feel the heavy under my armpit
was curious as to whether werewolf might bow to the cross but not bit doubtful as to whether his animal brother would respect the leaden pellets from WEIRD TALES the heavy gun
So protected both physically and spiritually stood and looked down upon the little village and then turning plunged into the wooded trail
tramped until midday and then at crossroads perhaps should say erosstrails sat down and ate the lunch had brought with me
The crosstrails marked the half of my journey and few more hours would find me looking down on my destina tion
lit my pipe and finally with regret left the delightful spot and took the trail to the left as had been directed
The other was overgrown with weeds and made promise in my heart that some day it would be explored
Tramping along let myself be lulled by the soft forest air and in my mind pictured these strange woods dark and forbidding as they were with the actors of childish sto ries halfremembered
Surely along the tiny trail ahead of me were walk ing the children the lost babies and the old witch cabin would soon come in sight eagerly looked for the gnomes and dwarfs and once crackling in the brush brought me about to scan the forest for the sign of the wolf of Red Riding Hood fame
Soon left the trail and sat down by tree
Soothed by the hum of insect life and the days heat soon fell asleep
It was late afternoon when sprang up and gazed at my surround ings
Angered at myself at once made for the path and turned down it for knew now that my sluggish sleep had made me late and was in no eager mood to be left wander ing in woods did not know through the evening and darker night
Hur riedly paced the path with no more thought of the elfin folk with which my fancy had peopled the woods earlier in the day
It was cold now biting wind had sprung up and dusk had begun to fall silently about me fact that accelerated my speed in an endeavor to keep warm
The path ran and wound among the trees and in the growing dark ness these lost their charm and in stead of hidden princes changed by the wave of witch wand into towering forest giants they seemed more like the hideous monsters of some forgotten era waiting to pounce on the unwary traveler who strayed from the path
It seemed too that behind me another presence paced and glancing behind me in the grow ing dusk saw white object melt in to the trees on my right
Slowly picked my way glancing about me as went and was soon rewarded by seeing it again for moment as it slipped between some tree trunks
Then stepped across little glade and drawing my revolver slipped behind tree trunk and waited
few seconds passed and there stepped into view monstrous white wolf that stalked across the tiny space
fired the deepening dusk being lit by an orange flame as my revolver spat lead and the beast raced into the trees with snarl that told me of hit scored
But it hung grimly on for several times saw it glide through the trees although ow ing to its caution was unable to get another chance to shoot
Then suddenly the path was crossed by another
swore in my anger for mine host had told me there was only one plaee where the trail was bisected by anything
Still here was another path well worn by the passing feet of multitude for many years bigger and broader than the one followed
Suddenly the question arose in my mind had in my first few seconds of wakeful ness retraced my steps
With this in view examined the broad path before me and then turned to look at the one down which had come
The darkness however had so cov ered the ground that it had van THE SIGN OF THE SEVEN SKULLS ished and look as might about me could not discover it
moaning creak drew my atten tion from the ground to the air above my head and started back with an exclamation
There only few feet from me was erected gibbet and upon it swung dead man
The wind which was rising rapidly swung him to and fro like pendu lum and the rope moaned and com plained
So intent had been upon the path that had not noticed it un til that moment
Poor fellow re flected had he perchance left loving arms and eyes that wept behind him or had he faced the world alone
Guilty or innocent had he faced death bravely or gone whimpering to the Great Beyond
Or had he cursed those who hung him
rustle from his shoulder and two little red eyes glaring at me turned me away shud dering
Crows birds of evil omen followers of executions
An old poem had heard in my boyhood days came back to me out of the an nals of years We shall sit on his breast On his broad manly breast And pick his eyes out one by one shuddered and turned down the broader path
Surely the old cus toms of ancient days survived here if nowhere else
Hanging man at the crossroads
My thoughts were brought back to earth by the cracking of brash to my right
Evidently the wolf was still there
npHE moon rose over the forest and the clouds raced across the face of it in the rising gale
They took odd shapes one was shaped like coffin another took the form of some belated specter hurrying to keep some dark tryst on ruined castles battlements and one remember that very well changed its shape in to skull with the moons pale rays glaring through the empty sockets
The shadows flung on the ground by the passage of these clouds also had dire and forebidding outlines
The entire scene was in keeping with the tales of the Hartz Mountains of ghosts and hobgoblins sheeted spec ters and hooded horrors and all the evil spawn of hell that ran through the tales of ancient Germany
hurried onward hoping at every curve or at the top of every hill to catch the lights of the little town shining upon me but instead the dark forest continued on and on and hemmed in my path
Several hours must have passed this way and it was very close to midnight when saw shining through the trees light to the right of the path
Here was shelter from the coming storm crude and homely shelter no doubt but shelter for all of its crudeness and with lightened heart hurried to ward it
As approached broader beam of light showed that someone had entered or left and as met no one along the pathway as hurried up concluded the person had en tered
To my wonder on approaching found the unmistakable outlines of an inn
How very good it looked
pictured the warmth and coziness of the great room within for was cold and chilled by the night air
paused with my hand on the doorknob and looked at the crazy little signboard overhead
The moon came out from behind the clouds and sent broad ray across it and there arranged in two rows of three each with larger one in the center were seven skulls
After the events of the night was somewhat shaken by the sight of those seven little emblems of mor tality that grinned down upon me in their deathly mirth but as the rain was beginning to come down in tor rents shrugged my shoulders and went in
Mine host might have his gruesome little joke but his fire was what craved now and if it was WEIRD TALES good why the sign would be per haps the center of tale about the roaring fireplace
Slamming the door against the wind that pushed with thousand tiny hands as though demanding ad mittance stood inside and blinked the rain and darkness out of my eyes
The great fire roared up the fireplace lighting the room with vivid fitful glow and showing me the contours of the several guests that were gathered near it
Ordinary peasants and for esters they all seemed to be and mine host in white apron and cap came smiling toward me
Welcome mine friend he said in throaty whisper the storm is indeed bad one and you are very fortunate to have made my door
While thanking him for his offers of assistance and hospitality looked at him carefully
His throat noticed was wrapped with heavy white cloth sure sign of bad cold and this explained his queer way of speaking
His eyes protruded fear fully from his face sign of in ward goiter so had heard but al together he was such kindlyap pearing person that followed him with thankful heart to the fires warmth the others making room for me
Food there was none so must perforce content myself with the re mains of my lunch to mine hosts ut ter sorrow
However as he brought me some really good Rhine wine could not object
His explanation was that this time of year his guests were scarce yet for several days he had had such an influx that he was eaten out of house and home
As had plenty of food left over did not object and was telling him not to worry himself when scratching began at the door
The tavernkeeper crossed to it hur riedly and swung it wide admitting as he did so the great white wolf that had stalked me through the woods
My dear little girl he cried thou art overly late
Surely have been very lonesome without thee
My dog mein Herr he contin ued in explanation
Savage to some yes but to me very gentle
He stroked the great white head lifted to him
But what is this he cried
Ach my little darling has been wounded in the shoulder
See mein Herr see how the blood has run
Ah those charcoalburners with their guns
Nothing is safe nothing And he ran for warm water and towels to bathe the wound
believed it better to keep silent as to my share in the episode and sat watching him
The beast whimpered and cried and then when her mas ters back was turned she swung up on me her red eyes filled with hate and anger
loosened the pistol in its holster for dog or no dog the great creature would die did it rush me
However it went to the fires opposite side as soon as the wound was dressed and there stretched out at full length in the heat
My frugal repast being now fin ished fell to studying the differ ent travelers at the inn
There seemed something odd about them that was at first unable to place
Then it dawned upon me the cos tumes even in this very old world they seemed out of date
The cos tumes of century or two ago
was delighted
This was romance
could not see their feet on account of the shadows but pictured them as being incased in long hose running to trunks and surely those capes in the corner were of pattern Ah you sleep came the inn keepers voice
You are tired then
Come let me show you to your room mine guest It was true indeed that soothed by the soft gutturals and the fires glow must have slept so allowed him to light candle and show me up THE SIGN OP THE SEVEN SKULLS the narrow stairs in the back of the great room to my bedroom
The rain had ceased but the clouds still ran across the moon drawing weird and fantastic shad ows across the ground
Underneath me could hear the voices and an oc casional creak from the crazy sign
bolted my door and sat by the win dow watching their queer designs
Sleep seemed to have left me and the room was bitterly cold yet did not mind either of these things so engrossed had become in the wild night scene without
Suddenly scratch came at the bedroom door bringing my thoughts back with snap to the present
The great white wolf or dog had followed me
sprang up and made sure of the doorfastening and at the soimd of my footsteps it padded away limp ingly
Poor beast
was sorry had shot it now but had no inclina tion to explain matters especially in that narrow room
went back to the windows and stood looking out
Suddenly the candle behind me started to go out
With an impatient oath turned about
The keeper had evidently given me very short one as he thought would soon be asleep thought
But no the candle was still quite long and yet it was dying slow ly as if for want of oxygen
Lower and lower went the light and then suddenly flickered and went out
Quickly struck match and went toward the candle but dropped the match when something seized my arm
At almost the same instant something else seized my leg and then was grasped by numberless little hands ill the dark
How can describe that fight in the narrow room
was filled with disgust and loathing as well as hor ror
Little creatures they appeared to be that tried to bear me down by weight of numbers
sent my fist in to faces and felt teeth loosen under the driving blows hurled some from me and heard them strike with crash ing force against the sides of the room and cracked skulls with the butt end of my revolver
Still was forced back and back for their num ber seemed legion and then weak and worn out was forced to the bed and bent back and back until was flung upon it
My shirt was torn open in the struggle and bled from number of tiny wounds yet still fought grimly on with horror in my mind horror of these unseen foemen
As my back touched the bed the moon sprang out from behind cloud and lay in broad beam across me
The tiny silver cross caught and re flected the rays and suddenly as it had commenced the attack was withdrawn my foemen vanished if you can call people who were never not even in the moonlight visible vanished and slowly as lay spent and panting on the bed the candle began to glow and finally sprang into life
Slowly staggered to my feet and stumbled toward the door seeking the companionship of those below
Under my feet fell bodies bodies perfectly invisible to me even in the lamplight
It never occurred to me until later that those below should have heard the row going on over their heads or that even the dullest ears should have detected the up roar to which the smashed and bro ken furniture gave testimony in that narrow room
With weakened steps made my way down the dim hall and narrow stairs and at the last turn saw with glad heart the great room leap into sight
Mine host cried mine host
But then after descended the few remaining steps with rush my words choked in my throat and WEIRD TALES staggered to the wall where stood in horror
The room was lit by red glow that seemed to have no source
The fire or for that matter any fire ev er built my man could not have made the awful glaring red that filled the entire room
It seared and burned into the brain bringing out every detail with startling distinct ness and the travelers who now swung slowly around to face me were not human
The faces were the faces of those long dead dead that lived the undead of century long past
Those clothes were the doublets and liosen of long ago
Long wicked swords hung at sides the faces ah the faces
were skulls skulls picked clean and white by the graveworm in moldering tombs
Only the sock ets were filled with that reddish glare of hell that pervaded the entire room
The innkeepers eyes still protruded from his sockets but the bandage of few hours earlier was gone and his neck was twisted and broken the face was that of newly hung man with the horror of death still upon it
Under my horrorstricken scru tiny the lineaments changed and it became skull horrid grinning skull like the others only the twist ed neck remaining awry and the vertebra showing jagged beneath the leering deathmask
growl brought my terrorfilled eyes to the white wolf that sat by the fire
Slowly it stood up on its hind legs like trained animal and then hellish and terrible transforma tion took place
The body grew to greater height the long cruel snout vanished the beastlike properties were slowly banished one by one and human lines took their places until girl stood glaring at me
girl demon from hells darkest pits with eyes of reddish hate were wolf one of the truly undead
crouched in my corner as the awful faces turned toward me and drew my weapon
The werewolf moved toward me its right arm dang ling and then sent shot after shot into the throng to no avail
Bullets had failed and was at the mercy of these leering horrors
In fear and horror ran my hand up my bosom toward my throat and felt beneath my trembling fingers the tiny cross
Swiftly tore my shirt open and held the emblem toward them as cried Back back you fiends
Evil fear not The wolf recoiled and the faces of the others turned toward each other as though in whispered consultation
So Death took council while mad man waving silver cross faced his ranks
Slowly they arose and came toward me and formed hideous circle in front of me
The things had decided suppose to frighten me into dropping the little cross and then felt my senses going my hand was trembling and dark little motes began dancing before my eyes the walls reeled about me and the only solid substance in the universe was that leering crowd of deathmasks with the white hatefilled face of the fiend in girlish form that ringed me in
The red light seemed to glow and then to fade as fought for the mastery of my mind white glow flooded the scene somewhere seemed to hear cock crow and then as fell heard shriek as of some baffled fiend who hears the fall of curtain of safety between it and the victim upon which its claws have been so nearly laid
ate afternoon had come when opened my eyes and found my self on rude cot in entirely differ ent surroundings
An old man whose face was kindly rose from the fire and came toward me with some gruel in his hands
THE SIGN OF THE SEVEN SKULLS Drink this and sleep he said yon are in safe hands at last my friend
For several days tarried with the charcoalburner and his stalwart son in the rude little shelter they called home and drew from them the tale of the inn and its occupants that now set down
For years the inn had lain on welltraveled thoroughfare in the Hartz Mountains and well along in the Sixteenth Century had been the stopping place for many noble and knight
Then Karl the Terrible had bought it and gathered about him crew of murderers and slayers
He was credited with having traffic with the devil and his only sister had sur passed him in all evil finally becom ing so the story ran werewolf
Travelers were murdered by his creatures and their bodies hidden in the cellar
Tales of screams and cries were circulated until it came at length to the baron of the district one Hoerlarin of Kraanstaadt
He at length with goodly gathering of menatarms and knights had one day suddenly appeared at the inn and captured Karl and his men
The sister had escaped
The trial had been swift and sure for very little digging brought the bones in the cellar to light
Punish ment had followed as swiftly
The many followers had been tied to the beds of the inn and burned alive in its conflagration Karl was taken to the crossroads and hung so that all might see and fear but the sister was never found
The road fell into disuse even as the great castle at Kraanstaadt had crumbled and become dark
Yet the ruins of the inn blackened and seared by the purging fire still con tained evil qualities and there night after night had gathered the evil crew for ghastly carousals
Karls body swung at the old cross roads until moonrise when he de scended and joined his old compan ions and often the white form of werewolf was seen as it slipped be tween the tree trunks toward the den of hell
In the blackened ruins had been found for the shots of the night be fore had been heard and investigated by the two charcoalburners
Perhaps dreamed the horror perhaps the people of the Hartz Mountains are merely superstitious yokels who frighten themselves with needless tales of horror perhaps you the reader of this tale will smile but wonder what made my hair turn white and why the little marks of claws upon my body have never left
for one have never gone back to that haunted area and place my faith upon the beliefs of the strange peasants of the Hartz Mountains
ABRfdNqroy Tale of the olga Boatmen THE RIVER By AUGUST DERLETH Paviloff Russia May
Algernon Downes Esq St James Row London England DEAR Mr Downes am writing to let you know that am resigning my position as foreman of the men work ing on the dam here at Paviloff
My reason for so doing is most unusual one indeed and no doubt you will feel obliged to discredit it nor can blame you for doing so for even am tempted to disregard the indubit able evidence of my own senses so bizarre are the events that have led up to this culmination of my efforts here
Let me assure you had known of what was facing at the outset of this project should never have entered upon any contract with you
On the twentyfourth of February last your representative Mr
Solar Hamilton of Oxford arrived to con fer with Mr Randeur and myself on the building of the dam across the Volga at this point
Present at this meeting as Professor Sergei Bour skyMaminoff late of the University of Moscow and former pupil of Metchnikoff
He was here to repre sent the peasants of Paviloff and the surrounding country
Professor Bour skyMaminofif related the story of peculiar superstitions strongly be lieved by the peasants and he admit ted that he also believed in them ow ing he said to certain curious hap penings bordering directly on these superstitions
Mr Randeur scoffed at him Mr Hamilton enjoyed himself immensely throughout the professors entire relation but these tales of his had an odd effect upon me from the beginning
It seems that the peasants believe the Volga River is guarded by spirits who will rise up against us if we at tempt to stay the course of the river in any manner
You will say as did Randeur that the idea is utterly pre posterous
admit that it does sound preposterous
Professor Boursky Maminoff warned us repeatedly to go and leave the river but Randeur could not consider the idea
Finally the professor departed in anger
endeavored to argue with Randeur and Hamilton but both of them ridi culed me
At length Mr Hamilton left saying as he ent that if did not wish to stay he would see that an other man would be sent to fill the vacancy
Please notify Mr Hamilton to supply that other man
God knows what prompted Ran deur to do so rash thing but he built his cottage on little knoll al most directly in the course of the river
Everyone feared that if the dam should suddenly go out Ran deur cottage would go out with it
One day not long ago the twenty seventh of April to be exact as Pro fessor BourskyMaminoff stood on this knoll rebuking Randeur for his rash act and again warning him to watch for the river spirits most repulsive hunchback approached the two men screaming at the top of his voice The boatmen sing tonight
THE RIVER The boatmen sing tonight This in itself was an odd occurrence but it developed that the hunchback was quite mad and so Randeur again scoffed at what the professor said
The boatmen that the hunchback re ferred to are the fj hosts of those slav ish men or rather halfmen half beasts who were treated as animals by the nobility of Russia the men forced to pull the heavily laden boats of the nobility up the Volga
There are no such boatmen now although they still existed in
Randeur questioned Professor BourskyMa minoff and he learned that the peas ants believed that whenever the boat men sing it is sign of death
The pro fessor told Randeur that their singing had never failed to bring death
Of course you can well imagine what an effect this had on Randeur none at all
He waved it away but
On the following day Randolph Smith our best patrolman apparent ly accidentally fell from the frame work at the extreme outer edge of the dam into the swirling current below and was whisked away in the space of moment
say apparently because we do not know
Randeur was stunned for moment but he blamed it upon coincidence
However he endeavored to keep it from Professor BourskyMaminoff but the professor heard of it and came directly to Ran deur and again implored him to cease his task
But Randeur would hear none of it
Last night while the professor was speaking to our manager the hunch back came again shrieking his un earthly warning
And even as he spoke the professor paled and mut tered that he too heard them chant ing in the distance and we looked at the river but there was nothing there
And today Mr Downes the entire left end of the dam has gone out the stronger side wiped out completely
And the men have all quit but Ran deur is still there he is going to build that dam he says
Hoping that you will soon find man to fill the unfortunate vacancy left by me remain Very cordially and sincerely yours Nemo Lawlor
andeur saw the last of his men leave him and he moved angrily toward the cottage
He sat there some time mumbling over his charts and plans
After while he came out and looked about him up at the remainder of the dam and at the river flow ing by as peacefully as ever and at the sky to see if there were any signs of storm but the sky was clear and away in the distance in the purple haze about the mountains the full moon was rising
And he looked toward the town and there he saw what he dreaded to see the dark figure of the mad hunchback moving toward him over the sand
He stood very quietly until the figure came up to him
His eyes were wide with ex citement and his straggly hair framed pockmarked face his huge distended nose squatted above his thin bloodless lips like vulture over some halfdevoured corpse his lips opened and closed as he came and his three remaining teeth were displayed in their rotting gums his clothes were dirty ragged and he wore neither shoes nor stockings
The ungainly hump on his back stuck out prominently
He spoke in nervous frenzy of fury
The boatmen chant again tonight
Do you hear them
Death is in the air
And the river seethes in anger and it will rise against you to night
And you are alone in the path of the river
Randeur cursed him and raised his hand in threatening gesture
The hunchback sped away and as he ran he shouted and Randeur heard the ominous cry echo far jn the distance
Death And harsh laugh sounded after it and Randeur shuddered
WEIRD TALES It was fifteen minutes past by Random watch when it started
Randeur did not notice the splashing of the waves until after some time had passed
Then suddenly shutter banged against the side of the cot tage and he started up from his blue prints and peered anxiously out into the night
The full moon rode high in the sky and there was not even fleece in the blue as far as he could see
But the shutter had banged he had heard it
And even as he looked wonderingly out the shutter banged against the housewall for the second time and immediately after another shutter banged and another and an other until Randeur rushed madly for the door but before he reached it it was flung violently open
He halted for moment then ran out and turning looked fearfully back at the accursed cottage
But now all was silent the shutters sagged list lessly on their illfastened hinges and the door stood half open
There was no hint of breeze the night was oppressively hot
He stared at the cottage until some inner sense beating upon his mind turned his head slowly toward the river
And there he saw multitude of white shapes indistinguishable fantastic ominous
And as he looked at them moving slowly up the river toward the dam he became conscious of loud sound as of the beating of the waves and he saw the river rise and swell and thousand white foamy waves lashed the air in fury
And from some far point in the dis tance came the low sound of hymn
Randeur listened terrorstricken
And as he stared at the white shapes almost at the dam his ears seemed to open and he heard in mighty chorus Upward onward we are one Randeur clapped his hands over his ears so that he might not hear that presentiment of death the song of the Volga boatmen but the toilers mocked his efforts and raised their voices and sang louder louder loud er
And the waves rose higher and higher and the song increased in vol ume and Randeur stood rooted to the ground upon the knoll on which he had foolishly supposed himself to be safe
Suddenly that same inner sense turned his head upward so that he could see the right side of the dam and he saw it crumble and vanish in the upheaval of water that followed
And it seemed as if his eyes were sud denly opened for he saw the spirits of the river pushing the water toward him and he saw too the moon shin ing tranquilly down upon the seeth ing waters before he closed his eyes in vain effort to shut out the scenes before him
And he heard the song of the boatmen rising and falling ominous terrible Upward onward we are one XTo sound did hear during the might but the river has avenged itself for the wrong that has been done to it The professor pointed to the jagged spar that was caught in the crotch of giant willow that stood upon the knoll where cottage had once been
It is all that is left of everything that has been here
Death has come and gone And from somewhere in back of the crowd of peasants that gazed in silent awe upon the calm river came the voice of the mad hunchback in wild echo to the professor Death
It was the mad hunchback who found Randeur two days later far down the river among the reeds and rushes that grew thickly there
Ran deur bloated face told of the ghastly things he had seen his bloodless lips were parted and tightly drawn his hair was torn as if in frenzy of des pair and his widely opened eyes stared upward in mute nameless hor ror
Strange Power Had This Belt of Human Skin The Girdle By JOSEPH McCORD HE pool of mottled light on the tabletop had drifted over to where Sir Johns elawlike fingers emerging from the silk sleeve of his dressing robe drummed slowly on the black oak
Carson erect on the hearth rug had ignored the chair indicated by the fingers and was filled with sud den resentment as he sensed the in different weariness of their tapping
And this old man was Pelhams father
It was all so different than he had pictured
There as no fath oming the expression of that mask like face with its impenetrable stare settled in the cushioned depths of the wheel chair
The heels of Carsons boots came together with suggestion of mili tary stiffness and he spoke curtly confess dont understand And his host replied in curious ly dry voice Perhaps it is not al together necessary that you should The words carried studied cour tesy but their veiled irony was not lost on the officer
But Pelham was my friend if he was your son and am here only because he asked Of course interrupted Sir John
Spare me the formula if you will
Hes dead
It was arranged you should come and tell me how well he died
He was to perform the same service for you no doubt had the circumstances been reversed
The Pelhams always die well
Its in the breed
If you insist however Carson choked back his resentment
There were circumstances that make it seem necessary and yet Pray get on Then Ill make it short Car son advanced little nearer the ta ble
It was in little hut last saw him alive
Enemy ground newly occupied it was and here was this hut in small clearing
It might have been woodcutters and it was empty save for some heavier furni ture
Several of us were poking about its one room then Pel started up crazy ladder at one end leading to small loft
heard him moving around and scratching matches then he was quiet
walked over near the ladder and hailed him
Nothing up here but an old chest he came back and empty at that Then heard him laugh
Somebody left me Dutch Sam Browne thought the cursed thing was snake felt cold heard the lid of the chest fall then Pel started down into the room
Partway he turned and faced me
He had the end of belt in each hand holding it behind him as if he were going to wear it
didnt no tice that though
All saw was his face the way he looked The way he looked prompted Sir John as the younger man stared at him soberly
And pray how did he look WEIRD TALES Carson seemed to pull himself to gether with an effort
Thats ex actly what have to tell you
Ill try to He seated himself on the edge of the table one booted foot swinging nervously
Why it was his eyes think yes thats what it was
There was something in them that shouldnt ever be in mans eyes
Youve seen dog that was vicious and coward all at the same time
He wants to go at your throat and something holds him for the mo ment He drew long breath
It was like that he decided
Sir John was watching one of his visitors hands it had gripped the edge of the table and the knuckles were white
The boot was motion less tense
As you say like dog
Well At the quiet words the younger man relaxed
Yes sir he agreed gratefully
Then spoke to him and he never answered
He came on down the ladder slowly still facing us
The others were drawing up be hind me could feel them
We all watched Pel
It wasnt that he just moved slowly either it was some thing different
think thats the way to say it
And he watched us never blinked
No one said word
When Pels feet hit the floor he began moving toward the door it had come shut
He backed to it and began feeling for the latch with one hand holding the belt all the time
He kicked the door open with his heel
Then knew
we were losing him if you can understand what mean knew hed got to be saved from something
Carsons voice was curiously strained
wanted to stop him tell you did want to
started for him And the belt interposed Sir John quietly
The belt echoed the other man dully
Oh yes
He held it all the while just told you that But he escaped He did
had scarcely moved
He gave dreadful sort of cry and leaped out of th
doorway back ward
We rushed it then
But he had made the trees and we could hear him crashing through the under growth as though there hadnt been boche within hundred miles of us
Thats how he went he heavy silence that followed was broken only by coal falling in the grate
With long sigh Car son raised his head
He fumbled pack of cigarettes thrust one be tween his lips but made no move to light it
am waiting came the voice from the chair
Waiting Come come
You tell me my son is dead
If recollect you men tioned gallantry
So far you have suggested desertion
The details Oh yes
The details
But you wont believe them
One would have to have seen Have the kindness Sir John leaned back wearily among his cush ions and closed his eyes
It was the third evening after that think it was the third
There had been an advance lot of machinegun ork
It was growing dark remember
Harvey my ser geant came up and asked if he could speak to me
Ive seen Lieutenant Pelham he whispered queerlv
Hes dead said
knew he was dead
Yes lies dead sir says Har vey but theres something queer about him
Will you have look He led the way and followed Carsons voice was becoming strained again
Sir John leaned for ward and stared steadily into his eyes
THE GIRDLE We came to little open place
There was some light there enough to see the dreadfullest group God ever bunched in one place
First of all saw Pel sitting with his back against little tree chin on his knees
He was staring straight to the front dead
But around him
Five German infantry men dead too
Dragged into sort of semicircle
And they werent shot and they werent gassed noth ing like that
Everyone had his throat tom
Torn Carson leaned close to the old man his voice shrilled as he demanded al most piteously You hear me cant you
They would be torn said Sir John Pelham very quietly
Finish your story The officer pulled himself together with an effort
It makes it easier having you understand
Ive seen men He thrust the fingers of one hand into the collar of his tunic as though it choked him
Ive seen men sir meet death in thousand ways but not not that way
And Pel wasnt marked at all looked The father leaned forward in his chair but the gesture of interest was not reflected in his impassive face
What of the belt He wasnt wearing it but the thing was there lying at his feet
And it was coiled
Show it to me Why yes took it
dont know why
dropped it in my kit bag next day got mine
Im just out of the hospital by month
Other wise Id have been here sooner With an unexpected clutch at the wheels of his chair Sir John was close to the table one white hand ex tended
Give it me An instant hesitation then Car son slowly pulled paperwrapped object from his pocket laid it easily on the table
Its in there he muttered
dont like tle damned thing With deft fingers the baionet loos ened the paper shook the contents on the table
Therfe lay the leathern belt coiled compactly
In the waning light it was of pale brown color thin and very flexible
On the other end was metal clasp its surface cut with marks that might or might not have been characters
There was reading lens lying near and Sir John used it to study the coiled strap
He exam ined it grimly from many angles without once touching it
Finished he leaned back in his chair and thoughtfully tapped the palm of his hand with the lens
Captain Carson Sir Attend most carefully to what say follow my instructions exactly
Take that belt in one hand only
Carry it to the hearth lay it directly on the coals
When it is burned quite burned you may tell me Carson got slowly to his feet
With hand that hesitated and was none too steady he reached for the coiled belt lifted it few inches from the table
At his touch seemingly the coil loosened it started to unroll
He caught at it with both hands
For fraction of second his body seemed caught in strained tension
Then he began backing away from the table noiselessly furtively
With an end of the belt in each hand he shifted his eyes to Sir John and they glowed with strange sinister light
From his sagging jaw came his tongue licking
Screaming an oath Sir John Pel ham flung the reading lens with all his frail strength full into that dis torted face
Drop it he bawled savagely
Jarvis WEIRD TALES At the call an elderly manservant came hurrying
He saw his master supporting himself on the arms of the chair trembling with the exer tion and staring curiously at the uni formed visitor
Carson was swaying unsteadily one hand pressed against his face blood trickling from between his fingers
At his feet lay the belt and the shattered lens
Jarvis saw all this and took his post near Sir John waiting his orders
Jarvis Yes sir said the manservant evenly
Sir John sank back wearily
The tongs Jarvis
Fetch the tongs
Pick up that strap
Only the tongs mind you dont touch it with your hands
Now lay it on the coals hold it down hard The three watched the burning in deep silence watched the belt writhe and twist in the heat scorch with flame fall in charred fragments
Jarvis Yes sir Lights then brandy for our guest
You may bring things and patch that cut for him To Carson Sit down man and pull yourself togeth er
regret was obliged to strike you but under the circumstances you will agree it was quite necessary think dont understand muttered Carson dully
He slumped weakly into nearby chair
Im felt dont know His voice trailed off his chin sagged on his breast
You dont wish to eat by any chance
What made you ask that
God no
couldnt cat only But Jarvis was offering him the brandy
None for me said Sir John shortly
But you may help me over to the far case am looking for book few moments Jarvis had wheeled him back to the table and he was leafing the pages of small book he had found
It as bound in parchment and bore evidence of great age
Carson shiveringly helped him self to another drink as his host turned the crackling pages until he found what he sought
Tracing the lines with lean forefinger he read silently for moment then looked shrewdly at his guest
This may interest you Captain
Read here and he indicated the place
Carson slowly deciphered the strange script of the handprinted page Another means wherethrough men have become werewolves is that they in som mannere gotten belt or girdel maked of human skin
By an autentvke eronicle yoman hadde such girdel which he kept locken in eheste secrely
It so felle on day that he let the eheste unlocken and his Ittel sono getteth the girdel and girteth his midel with it
In minute the childe was transmewed into mervilously wilde beste but the yoman fortuned to enter the house and with spede he remewed the girdel and so cured his sone who sayde he re membered naught save ravissing apepetyt
The book slipped from Carsons nerveless fingers
Wideeyed he stared into Sir Johns impassive face
When he could find the words God
You never mean you couldnt mean was in hopes mused the old man you know was quite in hopes you would feel hungry Here Are the Final Chapters of The Star Shell By GEORGE WALLIS and WALLIS The Story So Far arry williams Mark Dexter and Prince Danda Singh are catapulted to Jupiter in Dexters spaceship the Star Shell through the treachery of Professor Norden
After terrific ad ventures in the Forest of the Great Red Weed they are rescued from the midst of the Barbarian hordes that are trying to overrun Jupiter and taken by civilized men of Jupiter in Jovian air ship toward Nadir which is besieged by Barbar ian hordes armed with the Green Fire
CHAPTER THE BATTLE OF THE ISTHMUS rp HE battle
That means Delius that your peo JL pie have taken our advice and intend to fight for their lives in real earnest
Glad to hear it
But we are not glad Solitarians
The slaughter will be great neces sity it is true but most painful and sorrowful one
Yet the queen has decided upon instant and unstint ed action and those Elders who at tended her council have approved her decision
Within an hour of her landing in Nadir the order was given and our forces set in motion but not until we were despatched to your aid
We wirelessed you but received no response
Things are moving rapidly to the great crisis of our history
Though the Barbarians will have to go with out Megalof they are led by skilled generals and are in overpowering numbers and they intend to force the passage of the Isthmus of Cardi ac even at the cost of countless lives
Once they are masters of that strip of land between our two greatest continents our civilized cities and plains right up to the defenses of the Ridged Hills are at their mercy
Ostrong who would have us retire to the Hills at once has been asked to resign from the council Resign
Only that and nothing more cried
The old scoundrel ought at least to be given penal servi tude
Delius shook his head calmly
dont know exactly what penal servitude is but it is doubtless some thing dreadful
We do not share your ideas of revenge remember
Wo have virtually dismissed Ostrong from authority but more than that we can not do
He acted according to his own judgment and we think he was wrong and thats the end of it
man of his proud spirit will suffer greatly from his sense of fail ure You Jovians are the limit said
All the same shall be very much surprized from what saw of Mr Ostrong if this is the end of it
think there is quite lot of natural earthly malice about the old bird
About the isthmus put in Mark
You people by virtue of the Heat Ray are supreme on the water though you dont use it much
Cant you sweep the isthmus from both sides with rays from sea vessels
The shores can keep that way but the effective range of the Blue Ray is too short to reach halfway across the neck of land
And the Barbarians have lately used some great engines for throwing stones and baskets of flowing Green Fire re WEIRD TALES plied Oberon
Machines on the lev er and spring principle
By these things they have sunk some of our sea fleet and even destroyed one of our airships
Sounds interesting said Mark yawning
But me for good sleep
Wake me when we get there Dandy and were just as sleepy and while the airship sped on over forest and sea and plain flying straight as an arrow to its mark we went off into deep slumber
After our roughandtumble experiences in Malador after spell of short days and nights it was quite easy
We were becoming used to the unusual hardened to anything
They oke us when Nadir was in sight and the two vessels were sw oop ing clown to the landing area in the City of Spires
We had crossed the isthmus and the belt of smoking con flict
As our speed slackened we threw open the doors and the busy sounds of life came up to us the purr of traffic the songs of fearless birds
And with the sounds when we landed came the faint sweet perfume of flowers and blossoming fruit
If they dont fight for this they deserve all they are likely to get was my unspoken comment
Delius smiled
It is very easy to read some kinds of thought he observed
Have no fear for us now that the queen has assumed command
Your advice too will be readily welcomed more espec ially since you risked your lives in saving her
You will find our Elders and scientists eager to work with you
It may be as our wisest teachers are saying that you strangers from an other planet have been sent by the Great Power of the universe to pre serve our race in its horn of peril Steady with the bouquets protested
We have only handed you common sense
And here we are
We stepped out of the ship to meet quiet wellbehaved but neverthe less very eager ciowd of Jovian dig nitaries and officers among whom was the queen
Every few minutes swift motor vehicles laden with re charged rayprojectors dashed out of the city to the battle line fifty miles away
Already Solitarians said Queen Briseis looking rather tender ly at Mark fancied we have acted upon some of your ideas and hints
Our war cars are holding back the Barbarians and our warships of the water and air are attacking them
Within the last hour some of our chemists have manufactured an ex plosive mixture that acts upon con cussion
hundred of what you call bombs are now ready and thou sands of our skilled workers are pro ducing more
You shall see the fight for yourselves for your presence will encourage our forces against the reckless bravery of the enemy
So after muchneeded refreshment and bath in aromatic water from the municipal supply we boarded an aerial warship for the isthmus
Our vessel carried couple ef Heat Ray projectors and fifty of the new shells
It like old times is said Prince Danda
We might almost be back on Earth setting out in airships to upon the foe drop bombs
It very homelike is Tn few minutes we were hovering above the Isthmus of Cardiac hanging high in air surveying the scene through the transparent metal walls of our vessel
We were looking down upon the greatest battle in all the history of Jupiter
It was strange sight
The isthmus was narrow neck of land between two great continents and two great oceans
To east and west stretched land to north and south as far as the eye could see glittering expanse of water
Across this narrow allim THE STAR SHELL portant strip the fight raged
From eastward poured the Barbarians surging flood of rough sinewy prim itively armed humanity
The west ward end of the isthmus was held by the civilized Jovians equipped with weapons far superior but in numbers far less
It wasnt bit like France or Flanders or the Dardanelles
There were no lines of trenches no dugouts no shellholes no wire entanglements no bursting shells no humming air planes
There were rows of isolated forts rows of low white domes from each of which flashed the deadly Blue Rays
Against and between these domed forts the flood of Barbarians pressed
They were reckless to the verge of frenzy flung themselves for ward as though perfectly careless of life
Already behind their front lay three rows of the forts captured or destroyed and only two rows re mained
Green Fire smoked all across the isthmus was carried forward by thousands of men in little braziers was hurled at the forts by huge cata pults
In and out of the line of forts assisting their effect dashed the war cars opposing the Blue Ray to the Green Fire
From each side of the isthmus sea vessels kept the shores elear and airships armed like our own save for the bombs swooped low plowing lanes of death across the savage hordes with their burning rays
But though the advancing Bar barians fell by thousands tens of thousands pushed the front ranks on
Never have they fought like this before said Delius who had come with us
They are enraged that we are withstanding them so stubbornly after their many victories
If we can not hold them back till the frenzy passes fear we are lost
Your race is paying for its past weakness said Mark
You have given way before them so often that they have come to think themselves invincible
Anyhow we will try the effect of our sort of fighting now said
Put us across the isthmus slowly Delius Just as spoke whirling mass of fire shot from gigantic throwing machine caught one of the low swooping airships
The shock caused the vessel to turn turtle and she fell to the ground green flames curling round her
We are too high for that danger but not too high to avenge the loss cried Dandy hurling out the first bomb
Ah that most surprizing is We had not yet witnessed the effect of the new explosive nor were we pre pared for the result of the Jovian chemists first venture though we knew its action would have to be strong to overcome the greater grav itation of the big planet
It was strong
There was first blinding flash of light that seemed to scorch our eyes then huge upheav al of the ground volcanic burst of smoke and then quiver of the air roar of noise that shook the airship in every bolt and plate and made our eardrums throb with intense agony
And when the smoke cloud blew away in the gale there was shell hole big enough to bury dozen houses
Hundreds of dead Barbar ians lay around the edge of the jag ged pit and three of the catapults were smashed to fragments
It knocks into cocked hat shouted
This stuff will win the war But it is terrible awful nerve racking said Delius shuddering and closing his eyes
The butch ery the slaughter It is now or never their lives or yours civilization or barbarism said Mark
Ready Harry
Then WEIRD TALES overboard with the steel pills dose one every ten minutes
Let go
And across the isthmus we sailed dropping down our rain of death
CHAPTER OSTRONGS VENGEANCE TwicE we crossed the Isthmus of Cardiac dropping our bombs in to the smoking battle line and before the last shell had torn up the tortured ground the battle was won
Civiliza tion had triumphed on Jupiter at last
After the sudden scare of the first explosion the Barbarians rallied gamely rushing forward more fran tically than before shooting flights of arrows into the sky in vain rage but they could not stand the repeat ed shocks
Their lines broken their catapults destroyed hundreds of them blown to bits with every shell burst and the swooping airships sweeping the fierce Blue Rays over them ceaselessly they gave way at last lost their nerve and throwing down their weapons as they went trampling underfoot the officers who would have stayed them ran away in headlong panic
The eivilized Jo vians roused for once to energetic ac tion pursued the struggling hordes by air and land and we dropped our last bomb in the thickest part of the beaten mob
Then we went back for another supply and dropped fifty more shells amongst the routed savages
At least it ought to have been fifty counting them only made it forty nine
When the pursuit eeased the Bar barians had been driven wholly elear of the disputed neck of land
The Isthmus of Cardiac was safe in eivil ized keeping aixd the city Nadir the lovely city of sweet gardens and tapering spires was once more secure
My story of the next few days must be rather short and serappv
It isnt so easy to live all the time in the lime light so to speak and its rather em barrassing to sing ones own praises even at second hand
As said one evening when we three were alone for few minutes Snakes and tigers Mark
We are now and for ever the Big Noise here
If we werent extremely modest and the Jovians werent really civilized our heads would be bulging like bal loons
And if wo weneaat kept so busy as well Harry
know you two are about sick of it all and ready for home but you will have to grin and bear with your Jovian Cs and
little longer
For one thing as Jupiter and the Earth have moved in their orbits since we ar rived they are not in good position for the return journey
If we start at wrong time or in too great hurry we might not be able to stop or to reach the Earth we might drop into the sun and be frizzled up
And there is Norden to consider
He is problem
He says he wont return and we can hardly compel him
Nor caii we leave him here
Then there is our work the completion of the isthmus defenses the casting of the big guns the starting of the small arms factory
Besides all this Im simply reveling in interesting discov eries soaking up science from our learned friends
And you must ad mit that they are making us very comfortable
Especially the queen grinned
Wed if you want to stay here we certainly cant go without you
All the same the novelty is wearing off and we are feeling bit homesick for the Earth
These folks are all right in their way they can do too much for us because we happened to come along and give them helping hand but after all we are out of our element here
We have not tasted meat for week nor had smoke nor seen policeman nor read THE STAR SHELL newspaper nor played any sort of game
When you blow the engine whistle Markie boy we shall have our tickets ready Norden is indeed problem re marked Prince Danda
It me an noys that he is at liberty as well as old Ostrong
They much together are and often with the Barbarian prisoners are confabbing
They plan mischief much fear Its plain the old chap has never forgiven us for bucking up his race to fight and win said
He would rather stick to the old tradition that it is more civilized to die in innocence than to live in forcible triumph
We must watch him But what can he do or Norden either
asked Mark
We didnt know we couldnt imagine
We were destined to find out later to what depths of evil per verted virtue may descend
In the meantime we had feast of enjoyable experiences even while we cast longing thoughts across the black void to the distant little planet of our birth the twinkling little star we saw but now and then in the evening twilight through brief rifts in the heavy clouds that enwrapped giant Jupiter
Though the Jovians were so ex tremely scientific and civilized their home lives were simple
They had very little personal luxury and dur ing the whole of our stay on the plan et we never saw any signs of poverty amongst our hosts
Everyone worked at something everyone seemed to have enough to eat drink and wear and the public services of lighting heating water supply transport san itation and amusement were wonder fully efficient
Strikes were un known
have told you of their natural color pictures
We were shown mar velous glimpses of scenery on the scene and later in their express airships we were shown the scenery itself
could write pages and pages of description of the lovely river valleys the sandy shores and rocky coasts the ranges of forestclad hills the vast deserts the regions of bubbling gey sers and fiery volcanos that diversi fied the surface of Jupiter but you might not be as interested in the reading of them as we were in see ing them
Even we grew tired of travel of sightseeing and presently we had something else to think about
Delius took Mark aside one eve ning very mysteriously and after they had had long conversation my chum came over to Dandy and me looking rather red in the face
Wc didnt need to put our question into words
shall have to tell you two what Delius has been saying poor old Mark jerked out so may as well get it over
Its about the queen and Ostrong and me
It seems old Ostrong had his eyes on the queen thought he was going to marry her in fact
She turned him down of course being sensible woman
The mischief is That she has taken fancy to you instead and you dont altogether dis like the idea finished for him
Im afraid thats the size of it admitted Mark
At least as to the first item
You can leave me out of this if you please
It puts us in an awkward position
Ostiong has his knife into us now for more reasons than one
We ought to be off home before the mischief goes any farther for even
well even if wanted to marry Briseis the things impossible
She is much older than am the dif ference between our races is enor mous and the council would not al low it
They have actually had meet ings and discussed the whole business in all its bearings
Cheer up old pal said
It isnt everybody who jumps several WEIRD TALES hundred million miles to find his queen
It is hard lines not to be al lowed to become king but agree with our friends that the idea is pre posterous
Fact is we had better leave
That also do think added Prince Danda
My people in India will for me be looking soon have told Delius we shall go said Mark with sigh
The Star Shell is quite repaired ready fitted and fully provisioned
As told you few days ago it is the positions of the Earth and Jupiter that do not make the journey suitable or safe at present
am going into the details with their astronomical experts to morrow
It may be necessary to wait couple of months for the chance of starting the trip with any degree of certainty
We had to let it go at that but the thought was disturbing and not one of us slept well that night
npHE guest house that had been placed at our disposal was nice little bungalow sort of building in the suburbs of Nadir where after dark ness fell there as scarcely sound to break the restful peace of the night
In the long sleeping apart ment we each had hammocks in cur tained recesses
had dozed off for the third time when sudden tap ping at the metal window roused me with jerk
pressed the switch that made the metal sheets transpar ent and another that flooded the big room with light
Professor Norden was at the win dow beckoning apparently in state of considerable excitement
threw on few rags roused the others and let him in
No time to lose if you want to help he cried anxiously
Hes go ing to destroy it
Destroy what Norden
Who asked Mark roughly
The fellow had kept out of our way persistently since our return from Matador and the Red Forest
The Shell
The Star Shell the professor shouted in sort of frenzy
Wanted me to assist him
Afterward he was going to give you another spaceship one that would come to grief when on the way back to Earth
He has some of the prison ers helping him
couldnt do it so came to warn you
have car waiting
Better telephone the authorities fiist suggested
have already done so cried the professor
Come there is no time to waste
Half asleep yet and taken off our guard by his manner we rushed out of the house and followed Norden in to the auto
swift run through dark and silent avenues brought us to the aerial landing ground the professor talking fast and furiously all the way
He was clever scoun drel
As we stepped out of the auto at the base of the Star Shell we thought we were ready for any emergency
We expected to find fight going on between the aero guards and Barbar ian prisoners
All was quiet black and still and eery as night but as our feet touched the ground swarm of dark figures rose up and materialized out of every dense shadow
In few minutes in spite of our struggles we were all helpless in the grasp of sinewy Bar barians
An increasing crowd of the menacing prisoners gathered round
From another car which had followed ours Ostrong stepped alone
The glare of the solitary electric lamp that lit the open space gleamed odd ly on his mop of silvergray hair
He smiled grimly and lost no time get ting to the point
You aie indeed wonderful beings Solitarians but the end of your in terference has come at last
You have misled my people
You have THE STAR SHELL demoralized their moral nature in or der to gain for them material ad vantage
If you remain alive we may indeed conquer the whole of our plan et but our race would lose its soul would cease to be truly civilized
You must die and perhaps my influ ence may yet prevail
Prisoners do your work
Our captors pushed us toward the Star Shell Norden with us in spite of his protests and struggles
They crowded upon us each man carrying block of some dark substance
Whilst some held us rigidly others built up these blocks into roughly circular wall around both us and the Shell
The wall grew as if by magic built by hundreds of willing hands
Soon it was up to our waists and then those who were holding us freed themselves and vaulted over
We could not follow for everywhere we met the points of swords and spears
And still in silence and semidark ness the wall grew
Norden shouted angry questions but no one ans wered him Whats the idea Ostrong asked Mark quietly
It is quite simple Solitarian was the old mans reply
This wall is built of blocks of the green metal collected from the battlefield by the prisoners at my suggestion
Present ly we shall set it blazing and soon after sunrise nothing will remain of you and your spaceship but heap of smoldering embers
There is no escape you can receive no help CHAPTER THE STAR SHELL STARTS FOR HOME Ytit why am here screamed the professor in terrified rage
am no friend of these others
have not helped them have helped you in all your plans
But for me you would not have lured them here so easily
Let me come out
let me out
Shut up you miserable bound er said
You have been tool for the old villain and now he has no further use for you
Thats all You speak truly Solitarian ob served Ostrong smiling
One uses dangerous tools at times but one throws them away afterward
have quite done with Mr Norden
Jupiter will be well rid of you all And of me especially Elder added Mark though doubt whether the queen will tolerate your existence after this night At any rate stranger she will never look at you again was the vindictive reply of the old man
Light the fires Barbarians
You will be revenged on the worst enemies of your race and shall see the end of those who would corrupt the soul of my people
Light the fires
In few minutes they will be beyond all help even if the whole city be roused to try and save them
Light the fires Those were the last words we heard spoken by an inhabitant of Jupiter
The crowd of Barbarians had gone about their work eagerly but grimly silent and in the same grim silence they kindled sparks and set the green metal blazing in score of places
With lightning rapidity the flames spread curling in bright green waves over the encircling wall pouring in greet
cascades between the loosely piled blocks
Volumes of green smoke rose lazily to the dark sky
We were cut off from everything by ring of smoke and flame
Pale green tongues of fire came reaching inward licking up the dry herbage greedily stretching out toward us and the Shell
The affair was well planned well carried out
Before long we knew from what we had seen of the radioflaming of the Green Metal everything within that terrible circle would be utterly consumed
WEIRD TALES We had better jump through it and die fighting said in despera tion
That think also said Dandy
am ready Norden in frenzy of sheer ter ror groveled on the ground at the base of the Shell moaning and groan ing
We took no notice of him
There is better way out though it is risky one said Mark
Ostrong did not calculate every thing
Into the Shell with you all It was now getting so uncomfort ably hot and the smoke so pungent that we lost no time hopping up the stairs
Mark was the last
On the threshold of the doorway lie stopped
We cant leave Norden down there you chaps can we
He will have to come along and take his chance with us So back we went for the professor all of us coughing with the smoke and smarting from the rain of sparks that swirled around us
Norden was not grateful he was too scared to move
When we insisted he yelled screamed cried that the Star Shell was deathtrap struggled like madman
Finally gave him tap on the head to keep him quiet and we carried him bodily up the steps
Just at the top he recovered had another fit and fought us with the ferocity of wild beast As fast as he got an ami or leg at liberty he clung to the doorway like limpet
And all the time we wrestled with him the ring of Green Fire grew hotter the flames higher
At last we forced him in and whilst Dandy and held him down Mark closed the airtight double doors
Tt was like shutting ourselves in an oven
We cant delay our start very long said Mark mopping his brow or we shall be cooked alive
All the same we cant start just yet Why not we asked
Because we must wait for sun rise
Supposing we started in the dark we should be going right away from home flying out into the awful void of outer space beyond the orbit of Jupiter
No we must wait till the sun comes up If our glass windows can stand the heat without cracking said
If we can stand it Dandy his brown skin glistening with perspiration kept tight lip
Professor Norden still in the grip of fear went on groaning
Mark stud ied his registers
He announced that we had enough air in the cylinders for the long trip no more no mar gin for much delay
The Shell grew hotter more sti fling
The windows were squares of leaping and flickering green radiance
The padding of the inner walls was uncomfortably warm to the touch
began to feel dizzy sickly limp as boiled rag
It wont bcr dawn for twenty minutes said Mark consulting his watch
The metal of the Shell must be nearly redhot now
It will be race against time race be tween the rising temperature and the rising sun
Before the Shell reaches white heat we must go at any risk
Be ready The horror of that next twenty minutes will remain in my memory as long as live
Often on hot sum mer nights wake up bathed in perspiration crying out to Mark to let her go To the subdued murmur of the en circling fire was now suddenly added few faint fresh sounds and now and then mingling with the leaping green glare came stray flashes of blue light
We knew what that meant
The fire had been seen in the city and the queen had sent to our assistance
Our attackers were themselves being attacked
But am afraid it is too late said Mark
We shall not be able to THE STAR SHELL stay much longer
If the ther mometer rises ten more degrees shall cut off the gravitation of Jupi ter and then it may be goodbye to the giant planet forever Ten degrees groaned Dandy
Already cooked am was too far gone to utter word
We waited lying about in helpless misery
Only Mark upheld by his clear brain and strong will kept on his feet
His hands rested on the fateful little levers that would hurl the Star Shell into the black abyss between the worlds he had eyes only for the thermometer and the wateh on the table before him
The sun is rising he cried at last
You cant see it for the heavy clouds but know its there
lit tle longer so that it may get higher in the sky and then we are off
Seven degrees had no sensations save for fieree craving for breath of cool fresh air
Nine degrees said Mark warn ingly At that moment with wild yell Professor Norden sprang to his feet and rushed to the door throwing his weight on the opening lever
Air he shouted
Let me have air Hold him you two cried Mark
Keep him fast
We are off It is wonderful how you can find strength and activity in crisis
We collared Norden and hung on to him like leeches
He fought with the ferocity of wildcat but after ter rible two minutes we pulled him away from the door and got him down
Then we tied him hands and feet
And as we got up panting exhausted Mark pushed over the starting lever
Once more owing to Professor Norden the Star Shell was shot into space at an unchosen mo ment
An extra blast of heat grilled up roar of sound engulfed us we seemed pressed into the floor by tons of weight and then in deathly silence silence as sudden as the outbreak of the tempest of sound we all fainted clean away
The Star Shell had left Jupiter had passed through that heavy atmos phere was out in the vacancy of space was shooting with velocity unthinkable sunward and Earth ward
But would our journeys end be the fiery cauldron of the glowing sun or the dear familiar planet of our birth
CHAPTER NORDEN FINAL TREACHERY Xhen thoroughly bruised sha ken and trembling stiff and sore all over we came to our senses one by one the Star Shell was mil lions of miles away from Jupiter
The vast globe of the skv was deep black crusted with the manycolored stars and circled with the shining band of the Milky Way
Below us shone Jupiter already dwindling in size and above us glowed the sun glaring unshadedly across the terrible void Mark consulting his indicators shook his head
When cut off the gravitation of Jupiter he said the etheric pull drove us away from the planet
Now we arc going in his direction the at traction of the sun himself is increas ing our velocity
The pointer on the dial is again invisible
How many million miles an hour we are going can not even guess
Seems to me you will have to slip in the reverse clutch then ventured
Put on Jupiters pull again and try to slow down before we overshoot our mark
don want to explore the sun
have seen quite enough of the solar system to satisfy my curiosity for long time have already done that Har ry and yet we got such flying start WEIRD TALES that the speed doesnt seem to be checked at all
We must be halfway across the zone of the asteroids al ready and you had better pray we dont hit one
And theres Mars to westward and theres the Earth and its moon
One thing am pleased with we are heading more nearly straight for home than dared to ex pect Then nothing is there that we can do but wait asked Prince Danda Singh
Later shall be able to tell you more definitely what our chances are
Better let Norden loose now he wont be likely to do any more harm We untied the treacherous profes sor and helped him to his feet
He was white with fear and the first symptoms of spacesickness were grip ping him
He smiled weakly
Im sorry gentlemen he said
Ive been very poor sort of friend but beg you to believe that am sorry
must have been mad
Let bygones be bygones We shall trust you as far as we can see you and not an inch farther Norden said
When we get back if ever we get back there must be reckoning with you And then the pangs and nausea of spacesickness claimed us all for awhile and we forgot everything else in the deadly agony of that inde scribable malady
When hours later it passed and we began to recover we had reached the orbit of Mars
The needle was showing as quiver ing blur on the indicator dial
An other nine or ten hours at gradually lessening speed should see us some where near the Earth and our fate would be decided
Now that we were nearing home my thoughts went back rather long ingly rather regretfully to the giant planet we had been obliged to leave so suddenly
In spite of our hair raising experiences there felt sense of loss twinge of sorrow at departure
should have liked to see more of that wonderful world of vast con tinents and silvery seas of dense clouds and terrific storms
found now that had left them that had grown to like its civilized people their gentleness their good nature their marvelous science
wanted to know how the long fight between them and the Barbarians would go on in the years to come
Above all wanted to see the city Nadir again to look on its forest of tapering spires its smooth roads busy with traffic its gay gardens gorgeous with flowers and bloom sweet with scent and musical with the songs of fear less birds
It was some slight satisfaction in deed to remember that we had been helpful in the war that we had res cued Queen Briseis from the hands of Megalof and that the Battle of the Isthmus had been fought and won
If we reached the Earth safely said to myself it would almost be worth while trying to make the great journey again
At last came the critical moment
We gathered round Mark who had his hands on the controlling levers
He had to check our speed by cutting off and putting on in turns the at tractions of the Earth and moon and sun and so endeavor to bring the Shell into the atmosphere at the right angle
think we shall do it but it will be touch and go with us said Mark
have her down to few thousand miles an hour and hope to dive in to the air in the same direction as the rotation of the Earth
That will less en the jar for us as fielder you know in catching fast one lets his hands travel the same way as the ball Where shall we land asked Norden strangely meek
THE STAR SHELL Impossible to say replied Mark
We are approaching the night side of the Eaith
Hold on all of you
few more minutes will settle every thing for us
We are dropping fast
No yes
The speed is falling
Hur rah
We are home The Star Shell plunged into the Earths atmosphere as he spoke
The scream of its passage nearly deafened us the heat caused by the swift fric tion gave us another Turkish bath
But the resistance of the air quickly reduced our speed and it was quite gently that we dropped into the sea
We knew we had fallen into the sea for our progress was suddenly stopped and froth of boiling wat er heated by the glowing metal walls of the Shell hissed all around us
Then we went up again on the re bound and after few more plunges the great projectile lay rolling on the surface aimlessly as floating cork
Seized in the grip of some strong force it was carried forward turning over and over grounded raspingly was lifted again and left motionless at last above low water mark
con stant noise like the regular booming of heavy guns filled our ears
The door happened to be upper most We flung it open eagerly and crawled out upon the top of the Shell
One glance told us where we had hit the homeward trail
Tim Shell lay on the coral shore of tiny atoll
The sound we heard was the roar of the surf on the bar
We have fallen on Pacific is land said Mark
Uninhabited apparently
shall have to take our bearings and see if we are anywhere near regular steamer route The island was in shape like broken hoop
It was ring of coral rock interrupted in one place only curve of coral and yellow sand fringed with palms
Here and there thickening out it bore clusters of tropical trees
On the bar where the ring was broken the surf boiled and roared and all along the outer edge of the reef the heavy Pacific swell boomed and crashed incessantly
Within the reef lay the lagoon blue lake of still water calm as pond It was picture an artists dream
Might have been worse place for landing said
You have done fine Mark
You might have dropped us in the middle of Africa or at the North Pole
It will do us good to have lazy holiday here Mark didnt seem very enthusi astic
It looks pretty enough Harry but it may be hundreds of miles out of the beaten track
We may not see ship for months years
And we have to see if there is spring on the island or whether the vegetation de pends on the rain We made the circuit of the atoll from the gap in the reef to the other side of it and back again
We found coconut palms and few stunted breadfruit trees but not trace of water
Not even drop of moisture lay in the hollows of the coral rocks above high tide
Taking our position as well as he could with the instruments in his possession Mark announced that he feared we were at least hundred miles from any regular steamer route
Snakes and tigers
The middle of Africa would have been better after all
This is about as bad fix as we have been in yet
Ma rooned on solitary atoll without boat and with nothing to drink when we have finished our supply of ater from Jupiter wish had never seen you nor your accursed invention cried Norden
Nobody asked you to join us pro fessor said Mark in chilly tone
Go away and grouch by yourself if you want to keep out of trouble Although the outlook was black enough we three after what we had WEIRD TALES gone through were not easily de pressed
It was indeed rather diffi cult standing on that treefringed curve of rock and sand between the thunder of the surf and the calm of the lagoon bathed in sunshine under sky of flawless blue to give way to complete despair
But when three days passed with out drop of rain without sail breaking the monotony of the great circle of the sea and our water sup ply was nearly gone the charm ofthe lovely isle began to fade
To keep our minds busy we talked over our plans in case we were res cued
We knew it would be extreme ly difficult to convince the world of the truth of our story but we thought that if we could get the Star Shell safely home and Mark could produce his calculations and formulas before competent scientific men we might be believed in time
Much depended upon those precious documents and on the ovian photographs and curios that were snugly stored in the Shell
was shortly after daybreak on the fourth day as we three were standing on the highest point of the reef Norden had wandered away by himself that the end came
ship cried Dandy huskily
small ship full of sail
Here coming
Following the direction of his pointing finger we saw sehooner bearing down upon the island her sails silhouetted upon the rosy glow of the dawn
We shook each others hands danced croaked our throats were too dry to shout and waved our hats in the abandon of relief
We were saved
Our good hick holds out right to the end said Mark
We shall evi dently have to die in our beds of old age no matter what happens
Whats Norden doing The professor had evidently seen the ship before we had for he was already on the shore running and nearly at the Shell
We did not move for we were too far away to stop him whatever mischief he might be plan ning
Long before we could reach him he would be safely inside our precious vehicle
The treacherous hound means to leave us to steal the Shell to make journey on his own account said
It will be suicide for he can not work the vessel himself nor is it pro visioned now Utterly helpless we stood and watched the last act in the lifedrama of the wonderful Star Shell
Norden reached it climbed up and stood in the open doorway for mo ment holding out round black ob ject at arms length for us to see
The faint sound of his husky voice his cackling laughter came to us on the sea breeze mingled with the thunder of the surf
The climax was sudden unexpect ed
Norden appeared to stumble tried to recover his footing lurched backward and disappeared into the Shell
Instantly blaze of light burst out vivid even in the sun shine cloud of smoke arose and bang of fierce explosive sound shook the air
Then the gale blew the cloud away and where the Shell had lain was merely great hole in the sand
That was Jovian bomb said
You remember that one was missing in the great battle
Norden must have stolen it
What he intend ed to do we shall never know now
Perhaps he was going to blow us all up with it later
Anyhow he has only done himself in praise be Only asked Mark
Oh the Star Shell
You can build another one old fellow With all my papers and formu las the results of years of work THE STAR SHELL blown to fragments
With all the proofs of our voyage destroyed
Im afraid Harry that our first trip to the stars is also our last boat was now putting off from the schooner
And what shall we say to these people
How shall we explain the explosion and our presence here
ust tell them the truth Harry said Mark wearily They will want to know what ship we have been wrecked in they will be firmly con vinced that what they saw was the detonation of floating mine
But tell them the truth they wont be lieve it And they didnt nor does the world
But we three know
Mark is working hard again and some day perhaps
THE END WEIRD STORY REPRINT No
The Lady of the Velvet Collar By WASHINGTON IRVING stormy night in the tem pestuous times of the French revolution young German was returning to his lodgings at late hour across the old part of Paris
The lightning gleamed and the loud claps of thunder rattled through the lofty narrow streets but should first tell you something about this young German
Gottfried Wolfgang was young man of good family
He had studied for some time at Gottingen but being of visionary and enthusiastic char acter he had wandered into those wild and speculative doctrines which have so often bewildered German stu dents
His secluded life his intense application and the singular nature of his studies had an effect on both mind and body
His health was im paired his imagination diseased
He had been indulging in fanciful specu lations on spiritual essences until like Swedenborg he had an ideal world of his own around him
He took up notion do not know from what cause that there was an evil in fluence hanging over him an evil genius or spirit seeking to ensnare him and insure his perdition
Such an idea working on his melancholy temperament produced the most gloomy effects
He became haggard and desponding
His friends discov ered the mental malady preying upon him and determined that the best cure was change of scene he was sent therefore to finish his studies amidst the splendors and gayeties of Paris
Wolfgang arrived at Paris at the breaking out of the Revolution
The popular delirium at first caught his WEIRD TALES enthusiastic mind and he was cap tivated by the political and philoso phical theories of the day but the scenes of blood which followed shocked his sensitive nature disgust ed him with society and the world and made him more than ever re cluse
He shut himself up in soli tary apartment in the Pays Latin the quarter of students
There in gloomy street not far from the mon astic walls of the Sorbonne he pur sued his favorite speculations
Some times he spent hours together in the great libraries of Paris those cata combs of departed authors rummag ing among their hoards of dusty and obsolete works in quest of food for his unhealthy appetite
He was in manner literary ghoul feeding in the charnelhouse of decayed litera ture
Wolfgang though solitary and re fuse was of an ardent temperament nit for time it operated merely upon his imagination
He was too shy and ignorant of the world to nake any advances to the fair but he was passionate admirer of female oeauty and in his lonely chamber would often lose himself in reveries on forms and faces which he had seen nd his fancy would deck out images of loveliness far surpassing the eality
While his mind was in this excited and sublimated state dream pro duced an extraordinary effect upon aim
It was of female face of tran eendent beauty
So strong was the mpression made that he dreamed of again and again
It haunted his houghts by day his slumbers by light in fine he became passionately namored of this shadow of dream
This lasted so long that it became one of those fixed ideas which haunt the minds of melancholy men and are at imes mistaken for madness
Such was Gottfried Wolfgang and ueh his situation at the time men tioned
He was returning home late one stormy night through some of the old and gloomy streets of the Marais the ancient part of Paris
The loud claps of thunder rattled among the high houses of the narrow streets
He came to the Place de la Greve the square where public executions are performed
The lightning quivered about the pinnacles of the ancient Hotel de Ville and shed flickering gleams over the open space in front
As Wolfgang was crossing the square he shrank back with horror at finding himself close by the guillotine
It was the height of the Reign of Ter ror when this dreadful instrument of death stood ever ready and its scaf fold was continually running with the blood of the virtuous and the brave
It had that very day been actively employed in the work of carnage and there it stood in gium array amidst silent and sleeping city waiting for fresh victims
Wolfgangs heart sickened within him and he was turning shuddering from the horrible engine when he be held shadowy form cowering as it were at the foot of the steps which led up to the scaffold
succession of vivid flashes of lightning revealed it more distinctly
It was female figure dressed in black
She was seated on one of the lower steps of the scaffold leaning forward her face hid in her lap and her long dishev eled tresses hanging to the ground streaming with the rain which fell in torrents
Wolfgang paused
There was something awful in this solitary monument of wo
The female had the appearance of being above the common order
He knew the times to be full of vicissitude and that many fair head which had once been pil lowed on down now wandered house less
Perhaps this was some poor mourner whom the dreadful ax had rendered desolate and who sat here heartbroken on the strand of exist ence from which all that was dear THE LADY OP THE VELVET COLLAR to her had been launched into eternity
He approached and addressed her in the accents of sympathy
She raised her head and gazed wildly at him
What was his astonishment at beholding by the bright glare of the lightning the very face which had haunted him in his dreams
It was pale and disconsolate but ravishingly beautiful
Trembling with violent and con flicting emotions Wolfgang again ac costed her
He spoke something of her being exposed at such an hour of the night and to the fury of such storm and offered to conduct her to her friends
She pointed to the guil lotine with gesture of dreadful sig nification
have no friend on earth said she
But you have home said Wolfgang
Yes in the grave The heart of the student melted at the words
If stranger dare make an of fer said he without danger of be ing misunderstood would offer my humble dwelling as shelter myself as devoted friend
am friendless myself in Paris and stranger in the land but if my life could be of serv ice it is at your disposal and should be sacrificed before harm or indignity should come to you There was an honest earnestness in the young mans manner that had its effect
His foreign accent too was in his favor it showed him not to be hackneyed inhabitant of Paris
In deed there is an eloquence in true enthusiasm that is not to be doubted
The homeless stranger confided her self implieity to the protection of the student
He supported her faltering steps across the Pont Neuf and by the place where the statue of Henry the Fourth had been overthrown by the populace
The storm had abated and the thunder rumbled at distance
All Paris was quiet that great vol cano of human passion slumbered for awhile to gather fresh strength for the next days eruption
The student conducted his charge through the an cient streets of the Pays Latin and by the dusky walls of the Sorbonne to the great dingy hotel which he in habited
The old portress who ad mitted them stared with surprize at the unusual sight of the melancholy Wolfgang with female companion
On entering his apartment the stu dent for the first time blushed at the scantiness and indifference of his dwelling
He had but one chamber an oldfashioned salon heavily carved and fantastically furnished with the remains of former magnifi cence for it was of those hotels in the quarter of the Luxembourg Palace which had once belonged to nobility
It was lumbered with books and pa pers and all the usual apparatus of student and his bed stood in re cess at one end
When lights were brought and Wolfgang had better opportunity of contemplating the stranger lie was more than ever intoxicated by her beauty
Her face was pale but of dazzling fairness set off by pro fusion of raven hair that hung clus tering about it
Her eyes were large and brilliant with singular expres sion approaching almost to wildness
As far as her black dress permitted her shape to be seen it was of perfect symmetry
Her whole appearance was highly striking though she was dressed in the simplest style
The only thing approaching to an orna ment which she wore was broad black band round her neck clasped by diamonds
The perplexity now commenced with the student how to dispose of the helpless being thus thrown upon his protection
He thought of abandon ing his chamber to her and seeking shelter for himself elsewhere
Still WEIRD TALES he was so fascinated by her charms there seemed to be such spell upon his thoughts and wenses that he could not tear himself from her presence
Her manner too was singular and unaccountable
She spoke no more of the guillotine
Her grief had abated
The attentions of the student had first Avon her confidence and then apparently her heart
She was evidently an enthusiast like himself and enthusiasts soon understand each other
In the infatuation of the moment Wolfgang avowed his passion for her
He told her the story of his mysteri ous dream and how she had possessed his heart before he had even seen her
She was strangely affected by his re cital and acknowledged to have felt an impulse toward him equally un accountable
It was the time for wild theory and wild actions
Old preju dices and superstitions were done away everything was under the sway of the Goddess of Reason Among other rubbish of the old times the forms and ceremonies of marriage began to be considered superfluous bonds for honorable minds
Social compacts wer the vogue
Wolfgang was too much of theorist not to be tainted by the liberal doctrines of the day
Why should we separate said he
Our hearts are united in the eye of reason and honor we are as one
What need is there of sordid forms to bind high souls together The stranger listened with emotion she had evidently received illumina tion at the same school
You have no home nor family continued he let me be everything to you or rather let us be everything to one another
If form is necessary form shall be observed there is my hand
pledge myself to you for ever Forever said the stranger sol emnly
Forever repeated Wolfgang
The stranger clasped the hand ex tended to her Then am yours murmured she and sank upon his bosom
he next morning the student left his bride sleeping and sallied forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartments suitable to the change in his situation
When he re turned he found the stranger lying with her head hanging over the bed and one arm thrown over it
He spoke to her but received no reply
He advanced to awaken her from her uneasy posture
On taking her hand it was cold there was no pulsation her face was pallid and ghastly in word she was corpse
Horrified and frantic he alarmed the house
scene of confusion en sued
The police was summoned
As the officer of police entered the room he started back on beholding the coipse
Great heaven cried he how did this woman come here Do you know anything about her said Wolfgang eagerly
Do exclaimed the police offi cer she was guillotined yester day He stepped forward undid the black collar round the neck of the corpse and the head rolled on the floor
The student burst into frenzy
The fiend
the fiend has gained pos session of me shrieked he am lost forever They tried to soothe him but in vain
He was possessed with the frightful belief that an evil spirit had reanimated the dead body to ensnare him
He went distracted and died in madhouse
ROM time to time in letters to The Eyrie readers have affirmed that it is impossible for hair to turn white overnight from sudden dread ful shock that there are no nerves in the hairfollicles and therefore sudden fright can turn hair white only at the roots
The nerves touching the hairroots say these readers can cause the hair to turn white at the base and grow out white but the hair that is already grown out cant pos sibly turn white
However the belief that hair can turn white from sudden shock is so universal that we asked Dr Evans wellknown writer on medical sub jects and former Chicago health commissioner to settle the question for our readers bearing in mind Byrons lines in The Prisoner of Chillon My hair is gray but hot with years Nor turned it white In single night As mens have grown from sudden fears Dr Evans quotes from Puseys The Care of the Skin and Hair page Grayness is often influenced by emotional and other mental trials particularly those that are prolonged and it is not an uncommon occurrence to see it develop rapidly from grief severe business anxiety or other con ditions of intense mental strain
That grayness sometimes occurs suddenly is general impression which believe is correct
It is difficult to under stand the mechanism of its sudden production but some of the most unro mantic and reliable scientific obseivers have recorded cases of it That seems to settle the case in favor of those writers of weird stories who let their storypeoples hair turn white overnight as mens have grown from sudden fears Pusey says Dr Evans is an authority
Writes Jack Conroy of Hannibal Missouri Three months ago while waiting for train in an isolated railroad station picked up copy of the August Weird Tales and was thunderstruck by the transformation
All of the tales possessed distinct literary quality and three of them are good enough to be chosen by OBrien for his Best Short Stories
refer to The Woman of the Wood by Merritt The Whistling Monsters by Wallis and The MonsterGod of Mamurtli by Edmond Hamilton
The two succeeding numbers have not been entirely as good but good enough to surpass any other magazine in the field
The Bird of Space and its sequel were excel lent and Across Space captivates the interest
Your poetry is chosen with WEIRD TALES discrimination and all in all you may say to the other publishers in the words of Shelleys Ozymandias Look on my works ye mighty and de spair
There is one discordant note however the drawings to illustrate the text are bad William Bradford of Cleveland Ohio writes to The Eyrie The first story ever read in Weird Tales was Out of the Lone Ago by Seabury Quinn
Since then have bought every issue
Jules de Grandin is one of your most interesting and entertaining characters
Sometimes the plots are little farfetched but the story is always told in such style with occasional humor and scientific theories mixed into the mystery which carry the interest to the last word
In fact have not yet found story in Weird Tales that did not have its good points and this fact reflects much credit upon your judgment in weeding out the uninteresting stories
appreciate Weird Tales because can begin story confident that it has something in it and that wont lose interest and throw it away before finishing it Mrs Harris of Lakewood Ohio writes The quality of your magazine is improving steadily
The Metal Giants The Star Shell and The Grinning Mummy are my choice for the three best stories in the December issue
rites Alice Huffman of Indianapolis am constant reader of Weird Tales and enjoy the stories immensely as consider them relief from the monotony of the humdrum stories featured by most other magazines
really cant say which type of stories like best in your magazine but think the scientific stories are great
certainly enjoy all the stories of Jules de Grandin and the tales of strange beasts
Harry Levin of Cleveland Ohio writes to The Eyrie While waiting for the car this morning bought the latest Weird Tales
It contains story which think is the best that has been published for the last two years
It is knockout
The Metal Giants by Edmond Hamilton is the story mean
Give us more stories by Hamilton Your last two numbers are just about the best have ever read writes Barnes of Vassar Michigan
The Metal Giants was immense
am especially fond of scientific and astronomical stories but as whole enjoy Weird Tales all the way through
Without doubt find it the most interesting magazine on the news stands today
But why publish Weird Story Reprints when your own modern writers have the older ones out classed
Writes Jack Snow of Dayton Ohio There is no mistaking the finest story in the December Weird Tales
It is The Metal Giants by Edmond Hamilton
The author has gift accorded to few writers that of relating an imaginative scientific tale with sincerity and not with the usual hackneyed artificiality to be found in character and action of such stories Carl Ballard of Danville Virginia writes to The Eyrie The stories like are pseudoscientific stories devilworship black magic tales of rein carnation and stories of the gods of old Osiris Isis Pan Jupiter etc
do not care much for ghost stories
When is Munn going to give us that sequel to The Werewolf of Ponkert in which he promised us the Black Master would come back Walsh of East Orange New Jersey asks Have any of your authors ever been in that hot bed of witchcraft Abyssinia
Do they know of the wailing spirit called Bouda
Metamorphosis happens to be capital crime in Abyssinia and also in Italian Somaliland
One sees strange things THE EYRIE in those lands
Mr Warner Munn might find real food for horrortales in this locality
Sophie Wenzel Ellis of Little Rock Arkansas writes to The Eyrie The happiest days of the month for me are those immediately following the first when am reading Weird Tales
In my clipping file of short stories there are more distinctive stories from your magazine than any other
Why do you not select group of your best stories and issue them in book form
should like to see you publish more stories of the sort which is exquisitely fanciful such as The Woman of the Wood by Merritt The Moon Bog and The Outsider by Lovecraft and The Dreamer of Atlanaat by Price
Scott Williamson of Los Angeles expresses his ideas in verse There was time when life grew humdrum and found little magazine where thrilling tales abound
When reading in this book it seems that we are whirled Through endless space into another unknown world
book that helps us when our lagging spirit fails And rea wakes the joy of living is Weird Tales To the writer of the most helpful and constructive letter sent to The Eyrie discussing the stories in this issue Weird Tales will send Seabury Quinns original typescript of The Man Who Cast No Shadow which the coverstory for this issue
The typescript will be autographed by the author

Readers name and address WEIRD TALES The Man Who Cast No Shadow Continued from page young lady Dr de Grandin sor Detective Sergeant Costello asked re spectfully leaning forward from the rear seat of the car
Wait wait my friend de Grandin replied with smile
When our duties are all performed shall tell you such tale as shall make your two eyes to pop outward like snails First however you must go with us to restore this jpauvre enfant her mothers arms then to the headquarters to report the death of that sale bete
Friend Trowbridge will stay with the young lady for so long as he deems necessary and shall remain with him to help
Then this evening with your consent Friend Trow bridge you will dine with us Sergent and shall tell you all everything in total
Death of my iife what tale it is
Parbleu but you shall call me liar many times before it is finished
ules de grandin placed his demi tasse on the tabouret and refilled his liqueur glass
My friends he began turning his quick elfish smile first on Costello then on me have promised you remarkable tale
Very well then to begin He flicked wholly imaginary fleck of dust from his dinner jacket sleeve and crossed his slender womanishly ana feet on the hearth rug
Do you recall Friend Trow bridge how we went you and to he tea given by the good Madame Norman
Perhaps then you will recall how at the entrance of the ballroom stopped with look of as onishment on my face
Very good
At that moment saw that which made me disbelieve the evidence of my own two eyes
As the gentleman we later met as Count Czerny danced past mirror on the wall beheld parbleu
what do you suppose
the reflection only of his dancing part ner
It was as if the man had been nonexistent and the young lady had danced past the mirror by heiself
Now such thing was not likely admit you Sergent and you too Friend Trowbridge will say it was not possible but such is not the case
In certain circumstances it is pos sible for that which we see with our eyes to cast no shadow in mirror
Let that point wait moment we have other evidence to consider first
When the young man told us of the counts prowess in battle of his imcomparable ferocity began to be lieve that which had at first disbe lieved and when he told us the count was Hungarian began to believe more than ever
met the count as you will re member and took his hand in mine
Parbleu it was like hand with no palm it had hairs on both sides of it
You too Friend Trowbridge remarked on that phenomenon
While talked with him man aged to maneuver him before mir ror
Morbleu the man was as if he had not been could see my own face smiling at me where knew should have seen the reflection of his shoulder
Now attend me The Surete Gen eral what you call the Police Head quarters of Paris is not like your English and American bureaus
All facts no matter however seemingly absurd which come to that office are carefully noted down for future ref erence
Among other histories have read in the archives of that office was that of one Baron Lajos Czuczron of Transylvania whose actions had once been watched by our secret agents
THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW This man was rich and favored beyond the common run of Hun garian petty nobles but he was far from beloved by his peasantry
He was known as cruel wicked and im placable and no one could be found who had ever one kind word to say for him
Half the countryside suspected him of being loupgarou or were wolf the others credited local leg end that woman of his family had once in the olden days taken demon to husband and that he was the off spring of that unholy union
Ac cording to the story the progeny of this wicked woman lived like an or dinary man for one hundred years then died on the stroke of the century unless his vitality teas renewed by drinking the blood of slaughtered virgin
An English intelligence office would have said bally nonsense if one of its agents had sent in such report
An Ameri can bureau would have labeled the report as being the saueeoftheap ple but consider this fact in six hundred years there was no single record of Baron Czuczron having died
Barons grew old old to the point of death but always there came along new baron man in the prime of life not youth to take the old barons place nor could any say when the old baron had died or where his body had been laid
Now had been told that man under curse the werewolf the vampire or any other thing in mans shape who lives more than his allotted time by virtue of wickedness can not cast shadow in mirror also that those accursed ones have hair in the palms of their hands
Eh bien with this foreknowledge engaged this man who called himself Count Czerny in conversation concerning Transylvania
Parbleu the fellow denied all knowledge of the country
He denied it with more force than was necessary
You are liar Monsieur le Comte tell him but say it to myself
Even yet however do not think what think later
Then came the case of the young Eckhart
He loses blood he can not say how or why but Friend Trow bridge and find queer mark on his body
think to me If per haps vampire member of that accursed tribe who leave their graves by night and suck the blood of the living were here that would ac count for this young mans condition
But where would such being come from
It is not likely
Then meet that old man the one you call Indian John
He tells me much of the history of this town in the early days and he tells me something more
He tells of man an old old man who has paid him much money to go to certain grave the grave of reputed witch in the old cemetery and dig from about it growth of wild garlic
Garlic know is plant intolerable to the vampire
He can not abide it
If it is planted on his grave he can not pass it
ask myself Who would want such thing to be and why But have no answer only know if vampire have been confined to that grave by planted garlic then liber ated when that garlic is taken away it would account for the young Eck hart strange sickness
Tiens Friend Trowbridge and visit that grave and on its tombstone we read verse which makes me be lieve the tenant of that grave may be vampire
We interview the good minister of the church and learn that another man an old old man have also inquired about that strange grave
Who have done this ask me but even yet have no definite answer to my question
As we rush to the Norman house to see young Eckhart stop at an WEIRD TALES Next Month The City of Glass By JOEL MARTIN NICHOLS JR masterpiece of weird fiction tale of Atlantis of incred ibly aged human beings who have built their city of glass in the Afri can desert complete novelette of uncanny thrills and terrify ing adventures weirdscientific story of Titanic mushrooms and giant toadstools of exploding fungi and deathdealing spores

Nome Address City trite Italian green grocers and ask for fresh garlic for think perhaps we can use it to protect the young Eckhart if it really is vampire which is troubling him
Parbleu some man an old old man have what you Americans call cornered the available supply of garlic
Cordieu tell me this old man he constantly crosses our trail
Also he is very great nuisance The Italian tell me the garlic was sent to house in Rupleysville so have an idea where this interfering old rascal may abide
But at that moment have greater need to see our friend Eckhart than to ask further questions of the Italian
Be fore go however tell that shop keeper that his garlic customer has the evil eye
Parbleu Monsieur Gar licBuyer you will have no more deal ings with that Italian
He knows what he knows
When we arrive at the Norman house we find young Eckhart in great trouble and black serving maid tells of strangelooking woman who bit him
Also we find tooth marks on his breast
The vampire woman Sarah is in very truth at large tell me and so hasten to the cemetery to make her fast to her grave with wooden stake for once he is staked down the vampire can no longer roam
He is finished
Friend Trowbridge will testify he saw blood on the stake driven into drave dug nearly three hundred years ago
Is it not so mon ami nodded assent and he took up his narrative Why this old man should wish to liberate the vampirewoman know not certain it is one of that grisly guild or one closely associated with it as this Count Czerny undoubted ly was can tell when another of the company is in the vicinity and doubt not he did this deed for pure malice and deviltry
WEIRD TALES However that may be Friend Trowbridge tells me he have seen the count and that he seems to have aged greatly
The man who visited the clergyman and the man who bought the garlic was also much older than the count as we knew him Ah ha he is coming to the end of his century tell me now look out for devilment Jules de Grandin
Cer tainly it is sure to come And then my Sergent come you with your tale of Mademoiselle Noi mans disappearance and too think perhaps she has run away from home voluntarily of her own free will until you say the Italian shopkeeper recognized the old man who accosted her as one who has the evil eye
Now what old man save the one who bought the garlic and who lives at Rupleysville would that Italian accuse of the evil eye
Par dieu has he not already told you the same man once bought his garlic
But yes
The case is complete
The girl has disappeared an old old man has accosted her an old old man who was so strong he could over come policeman the count is near ing his century mark when he must die like other men unless he can se cure the blood of virgin to revivify him
am more than certain that the count and baron are one and the same and that they both dwell at Rupleysville
Voila we go to Rup leysville and we arrive there not one little minute too soon
Nestcepas mes amis Sure Costello agreed rising and holding out his hand in farewell youve got th goods doc

New York NY Why run the chance of missing an issue of WEIRD TALES SUBSCRIBE NOW
year in the United States in Canada Atomic Conquerors Continued rom page until it seemed to be obscured by mass of small dark clouds clouds that drew together fused condensed
Smaller and smaller grew that mass of blackness the sunlight pouring down around its edges
And now it was descending dropping swiftly down toward the massed disks above dropping down until it showed itself as not single mass but as several dropping down until he saw that it was five black disks five that raced toward the line of other disks above
Wonder filled him and dawning comprehension
These were disks returning from the superworld he saw dwindling down until they en tered our own universe but how came it that only five returned
Five of the mighty thousands Mar lowe had seen that had attacked the superworld
Were they messengers
He saw the five race toward the hundreds above saw them hang with those hundreds for space of min utes then confusion seemed to run through the massed disks above that were suddenly swooping back down to the hilltop
As they sank down to the summit their numbers darkened the sky and he saw without under standing mass of their number that seemed to grow smaller that dwindled and vanished within the pit
Another mass did likewise and another
They were returning to their own atom
And now Hunter understood at last
The five were survivors
Their attack on the superworld had failed they were in retreat retreat from but look
The sky above was again darken ing even more intensely than before
Even as the disks of the invaders dwindled and sank with frantie haste into the pit the darkness above was compressing contracting resolving WEIRD TALES into myriad of dark long shapes shapes that swooped swiftly down up on the disordered disks above
Long black fishlike hulls utterly different from the disks of the atomic people
As they came down upon the disks flashes of violent lightning flickered from the fishhulls striking disk after disk sending them down in whirling masses of bursting flames
It was the superpeople Hunter knew pursuing the atomic invaders from their own greater world where the attack of their mighty fleet of disks had failed
From the few disks that stood to the terrible attack of the superpeo ple the blue Cold Ray sprang out sullenly but at its first appearance the circling swooping hulls vanished entirely from view
Then from all the air around the disks flash on flash of lightning stabbed at them
The superwarriors had made them selves invisible
In panic haste the last few disks sank down toward the pit and the lightning ceased abruptly
It was as though the desire of the attacking superpeople was only to force the atomic invaders back down into their own universe
The last few disks dwindled diminished vanished into the pit into the sandgrain and the last humming sound ceased
The in vaders had been swept from the Earth
Running out from the cabin Hunter saw that the pit was empty of them and he shouted aloud
Abruptly the long narrow shapes of the hulls reappeared above swoop ing swiftly down upon the hilltop
And with sudden sense of nearing peril Hunter fled down the hillside sinking to the ground when his stiff limbs could carry him no farther
Above the black hulls were clustered thickly around the hilltop and the droning of machine of some sort reached him then sudden sharp tapping of metal on metal

hulls suddenly swung up from the summit and hovered momentarily circling
And from one of their number beneath the rest swung sus pended glistening globe of shining metal ball some three feet in thick ness
Even as the awed Hunter com prehended that the superpeople had sealed the sandgrain within that shining metal sphere from all the gathered hulls above flash after flash of terrific lightning stabbed down to ward the hilltop with splitting crash and beneath Hunter the ground heaved and swayed
He stag gered to his feet glimpsed the edge of narrow deep abyss in the hill top created by that blasting force then saw the ball of metal whirling down into this abyss holding within it the atomic world forever Again flashed down the lightning and be neath him was gigantic rumbling grinding and crashing as the abyss closed prisoning the ball with in its incalculable depths
Hunter sank again to the ground his brain turning dizzily
He saw vaguely the dark hulls sweeping back up toward the zenith dimly saw one of them that swooped down close above him and hung for moment as if in curiosity and from the side of this score of faces peered down at him faces not unhuman in shape but unhuman in the high and un troubled serenity that lay on them faces that seemed to look down at him with calm benevolence an amused but kindly pity
Then that last hull too drove up toward the zenith and all gathered there expanding growings darken ing the skies once more bringing twi light that deepened into blackness blackness that hung for moment then broke up dimmed vanished
Standing there on the hillside Hunter raised tremulous hands to ward the sunlit sky as if in grati tude as if in prayer
WEIRD TALES unset illumined Leadanfoot with glory of orange and crimson light when Hunter reached the village
He walked slowly down the silent desert ed street and sat down wearily on bench in front of the inn
With an uncertain smile he remembered his conversation with the innkeeper and wondered where the man was now
And too with flash of sudden pity he remembered Marlowe and their toiling race up the hill
kind ly honest man he had seemed one who had probably lived life of se rene content in his quiet museum be fore fate dragged him into the whirl pool of cosmic war
war that he had striven to prevent however pow erlessly
And more somberly Hunt er thought of the other man of Pow ell
Well it was over now and what could one say of the dead
As it was he thought with those two dead he was the only man on Earth to know what had really hap pened
Those others those millions in the world outside they would be wondering doubtful puzzled yet thankful too
Well soon he would be getting back to that world to tell them what he knew
But just now he wanted to sit in the quiet deserted village breath ing its peace after his two nights and days of nightmare fear and terror
Just now he wanted to sit and listen to little trivial sounds the wind that whispered in his ears the crickets in the long grass In iext months WEIRD TALES will appear the most thrilling weirdscientific story Edmond Hamilton has yet written Ev olution Island the tale of spawning horror let loose upon the world

The Brimstone Cat Continued rom page toward us and one of them raised his hand in which there was heavy club
Another of my queer friends is Hari Tosuki the Japanese wrestler
Prom him once learned something of jujitsu
Now that knowledge stood me in good stead
threw the man with the club felling him with catch that broke his arm and knocked him senseless
Then grap pled with the other villain an ugly evil creature powerful but with misshapen back as discovered when finally had him down
Meanwhile the girl instead of fainting or crying out again had fled down the street
She came back just as was reflecting with some pride that had done credit to Hari my teacher
With her were two big policemen
They put handcuffs on our assail ants and the girl told her story while one of the policemen made notes for the charge that should be entered against the thugs
The girl had been on an errand in this part of the city where she was stranger
The errand had de tained her much later than she ex pected and in the dusk she had lost her way
The two ruffians had held her up and infuriated when they found that she had but few cents in her pocketbook had attempted fur ther outrage
She had broken away and fled down the side street coming upon me
As she told her story looked at her for the first time
Or was it the first time
She was tiny thing with redgold curls and dimple in one cheek that made my heart pound madly with desire to kiss it
Her eyes ere of clear blue like that of the sea on calm summer afternoon and as looked into them knew WEIRD TALES why Govern Ariste had never found other women fair
had been as voyager who sails on long journey seeking he knows not what until on clear day he comes to bay of calm blue water that is his harbor and his home
As looked into her eyes saw recognition of me leap into her own
My name is Govern Ariste and am sure have met you before told her
May call taxi and take you home And have met you although do not recall where she replied
Your name is an odd one but do not seem to remember it have always wished for com fortable sensible name confided such name as Peter
Peter would suit you much bet ter she agreed
My name is Edith Montgomery
live with my father who will be much worried at my late return
shall be very glad to have you take me home hailed passing taxi
As we climbed into it the police patrol drove up and big policeman led the deformed ruffian toward it
The man turned and cursed me the cause of his misfortune and in his evil face now under the strong light of the machines headlight saw distinctly the brutal features of Tom the hang man of London Town
But had other things to think of than hangmen
May morning in the hunting park of good Queen Bess or taxicab in dark city street when man finds romance what mat ters the setting
The rapture is the same
In some way can not remember the details we reached my ladys home
She left me with sweet spoken goodbye and an invitation to call on the morrow and receive her fathers thanks after she had told him the story of her unpleasant ad venture
Somehow can not remember the The Brotherhood of Light Most complete stock of books in America on Occultism Psychic Phenom ena Spiritualism Astrology New Thought Theosophy and Nature Study

Santschi Glenellyn Dl details reached again this room in Mrs Flynns house where the damnable eat has now ceased its caterwauling
have written this story what story
as best might when vis ion ever comes between me and my typewriter the vision of the sweet est fairest face in the world
What hair
what eyes
and what bewitch ing mouth
And her blush
Yes she blushed at the look gave her when hade her goodnight
Once before have seen her blush when raised her hand to my lips and touched the body of the brimstone cat Or did
Was my dream of Peter Byfield story only
the story am about to live is real enough hut was the other chapter real
Have the doors of the past opened to give me glimpse of chapter of life now gone but to be continued in new setting
Amir Das would say so and there are others who so believe
Amir Das has told me in our discussions that the philosophers stone which the alchemists of old sought is the pow er that some few men in East and West seek today the power where by soul and spirit conquer all earth ly things
One who finds this pow er is never horn on earth again as mere man
Thus teach the sages of the East
He has lived through all the chapters of life that were allotted to him in the beginning
have not found the philosophers stone but have found something dearer to me than my owa life
Did Peter Byfield live
do not know
But two things do know
One of them is that some day and that day not long distant shall marry the lady of my heart the girl of the redgold curls and the eyes that are my doors to heaven
The other
The other is that shall always hate cats
