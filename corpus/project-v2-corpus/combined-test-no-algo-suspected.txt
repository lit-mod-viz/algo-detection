can -PRON- not have -PRON- opinion whatever -PRON- be without this bad temper and this bad language 
-PRON- be too bad surely 
mrs dedalus speak to dante in a low voice but dante say loudly will not say nothing 
i will defend -PRON- church and -PRON- religion when -PRON- be insult and spit on by renegade catholic 
mr casey push -PRON- plate rudely into the middle of the table and rest -PRON- elbow before -PRON- say in a hoarse voice to -PRON- host tell -PRON- do i tell -PRON- that story about a very famous spit

i be a catholic as -PRON- father be and -PRON- father before -PRON- and -PRON- father before -PRON- again when -PRON- give up -PRON- life rather than sell -PRON- faith

but -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say that -PRON- be a spoiled nun and that -PRON- have come out of the convent in the alleghanie when -PRON- brother have get the money from the savage for the trinket and the chainie 
perhaps that make -PRON- severe against parnell

-PRON- be not nice about the spit in the woman eye 
but what be the name the woman have call kitty oshea that mr casey would not repeat 
-PRON- think of mr casey walk through the crowd of people and make speech from a wagonette 
that be what -PRON- have be in prison for and -PRON- remember that one night sergeant oneill have come to the house and have stand in the hall talk in a low voice with -PRON- father and chew nervously at the chinstrap of -PRON- cap 
and that night mr casey have not go to dublin by train but a car have come to the door and -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say something about the cabinteely road

and that s why -PRON- run away if -PRON- want to know 
and the fellow who have speak first say yes that s what i hear too from the fellow in the high line 
the fellow all be silent 
stephen stand among -PRON- afraid to speak listening 
a faint sickness of awe make -PRON- feel weak 
how could -PRON- have do that 
-PRON- think of the dark silent sacristy 
there be dark wooden press there where the crimped surplice lie quietly fold 
-PRON- be not the chapel but still -PRON- have to speak under -PRON- breath 
-PRON- be a holy place 
-PRON- remember the summer evening -PRON- have be there to be dress as boatbearer the evening of the procession to the little altar in the wood 
a strange and holy place 
the boy that hold the censer have swing -PRON- gently to and fro near the door with the silvery cap lift by the middle chain to keep the coal light 
that be call charcoal and -PRON- have burn quietly as the fellow have swing -PRON- gently and have give off a weak sour smell 
and then when all be vest -PRON- have stand hold out the boat to the rector and the rector have put a spoonful of incense in -PRON- and -PRON- have hiss on the red coal 
the fellow be talk together in little group here and there on the playground 
the fellow seem to -PRON- to have grow small that be because a sprinter have knock -PRON- down the day before a fellow out of second of grammar 
-PRON- have be throw by the fellow machine lightly on the cinderpath and -PRON- spectacle have be break in three piece and some of the grit of the cinder have go into -PRON- mouth 
that be why the fellow seem to -PRON- small and farther away and the goalpost so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up 
but there be no play on the football ground for cricket be come and some say that barne would be prof and some say -PRON- would be flower 
and all over the playground -PRON- be play rounder and bowl twister and lob 
and from here and from there come the sound of the cricket bat through the soft grey air 
-PRON- say pick pack pock puck little drop of water in a fountain slowly fall in the brimming bowl 
athy who have be silent say quietly -PRON- be all wrong 
all turn towards -PRON- eagerly 
why 
do -PRON- know 
who tell -PRON- 
tell -PRON- athy 
athy point across the playground to where simon moonan be walk by -PRON- kick a stone before -PRON- 
ask -PRON- -PRON- say 
the fellow look there and then say why -PRON-

i will tell -PRON- but -PRON- must not let on -PRON- know 
tell -PRON- athy 
go on 
-PRON- may if -PRON- know 
-PRON- pause for a moment and then say mysteriously -PRON- be catch with simon moonan and tusker boyle in the square one night 
the fellow look at -PRON- and ask catch 
what do 
athy say smugge 
all the fellow be silent and athy say and that s why 
stephen look at the face of the fellow but -PRON- be all look across the playground 
-PRON- want to ask somebody about -PRON- 
what do that mean about the smugging in the square 
why do the five fellow out of the high line run away for that 
-PRON- be a joke -PRON- think 
simon moonan have nice clothe and one night -PRON- have show -PRON- a ball of creamy sweet that the fellow of the football fifteen have roll down to -PRON- along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when -PRON- be at the door 
-PRON- be the night of the match against the bective ranger and the ball be make just like a red and green apple only -PRON- open and -PRON- be full of the creamy sweet 
and one day boyle have say that an elephant have two tusker instead of two tusk and that be why -PRON- be call tusker boyle but some fellow call -PRON- lady boyle because -PRON- be always at -PRON- nail pare -PRON- 
eileen have long thin cool white hand too because -PRON- be a girl 
-PRON- be like ivory only soft 
that be the meaning of tower of ivory but protestant could not understand -PRON- and make fun of -PRON- 
one day -PRON- have stand beside -PRON- look into the hotel ground 
a waiter be run up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier be scamper to and fro on the sunny lawn 
-PRON- have put -PRON- hand into -PRON- pocket where -PRON- hand be and -PRON- have feel how cool and thin and soft -PRON- hand be 
-PRON- have say that pocket be funny thing to have and then all of a sudden -PRON- have break away and have run laugh down the slope curve of the path 
-PRON- fair hair have stream out behind -PRON- like gold in the sun 
tower of ivory 
house of gold by think of thing -PRON- could understand -PRON- 
but why in the square 
-PRON- go there when -PRON- want to do something 
-PRON- be all thick slab of slate and water trickle all day out of tiny pinhole and there be a queer smell of stale water there 
and behind the door of one of the closet there be a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath be the name of the drawing balbus be build a wall some fellow have draw -PRON- there for a cod 
-PRON- have a funny face but -PRON- be very like a man with a beard 
and on the wall of another closet there be write in backhand in beautiful writing julius csar write the calico belly perhaps that be why -PRON- be there because -PRON- be a place where some fellow write thing for cod 
but all the same -PRON- be queer what athy say and the way -PRON- say -PRON- 
-PRON- be not a cod because -PRON- have run away 
-PRON- look with the other across the playground and begin to feel afraid 
at last fleming say and -PRON- be all to be punish for what other fellow do wonot come back see if i do cecil thunder say 
three day silence in the refectory and send -PRON- up for six and eight every minute 
yes say well 
and old barrett have a new way of twist the note so that -PRON- canot open -PRON- and fold -PRON- again to see how many ferul -PRON- be to get 
i wonot come back too 
yes say cecil thunder and the prefect of study be in second of grammar this morning 
let -PRON- get up a rebellion fleming say 
will -PRON- 
all the fellow be silent 
the air be very silent and -PRON- could hear the cricket bat but more slowly than before pick pock 
well ask what be go to be do to -PRON- 
simon moonan and tusker be go to be flog athy say and the fellow in the high line get -PRON- choice of flog or be expel 
and which be -PRON- take ask the fellow who have speak first 
all be take expulsion except corrigan athy answer go to be flog by mr gleeson know why cecil thunder say 
-PRON- be right and the other fellow be wrong because a flogging wear off after a bit but a fellow that have be expel from college be know all -PRON- life on account of -PRON- 
besides gleeson wonot flog -PRON- hard good of -PRON- play not to fleme say wouldnot like to be simon moonan and tusker cecil thunder say 
but i donot believe -PRON- will be flog 
perhaps -PRON- will be send up for twice nine 
no no say athy both get -PRON- on the vital spot 
well rub -PRON- and say in a cry voice please sir let -PRON- off 
athy grin and turn up the sleeve of -PRON- jacket say -PRON- canot be help -PRON- must be do 
so down with -PRON- breech and out with -PRON- bum 
the fellow laugh but -PRON- feel that -PRON- be a little afraid 
in the silence of the soft grey air -PRON- hear the cricket bat from here and from there pock 
that be a sound to hear but if -PRON- be hit then -PRON- would feel a pain 
the pandybat make a sound too but not like that 
the fellow say -PRON- be make of whalebone and leather with lead inside and -PRON- wonder what be the pain like 
there be different kind of sound 
a long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and -PRON- wonder what be that pain like 
-PRON- make -PRON- shivery to think of -PRON- and cold and what athy say too 
but what be there to laugh at in -PRON- 
-PRON- make -PRON- shivery but that be because -PRON- always feel like a shiver when -PRON- let down -PRON- trouser 
-PRON- be the same in the bath when -PRON- undress -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder who have to let -PRON- down the master or the boy -PRON- how could -PRON- laugh about -PRON- that way 
-PRON- look at rolledup sleeve and knuckly inky hand 
-PRON- have roll up -PRON- sleeve to show how mr gleeson would roll up -PRON- sleeve 
but mr gleeson have round shiny cuff and clean white wrist and fattish white hand and the nail of -PRON- be long and pointed 
perhaps -PRON- pare -PRON- too like lady boyle 
but -PRON- be terribly long and pointed nail 
so long and cruel -PRON- be though the white fattish hand be not cruel but gentle 
and though -PRON- tremble with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nail and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill -PRON- feel at the end of -PRON- shirt when -PRON- undress -PRON- yet -PRON- feel a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside -PRON- to think of the white fattish hand clean and strong and gentle 
and -PRON- think of what cecil thunder have say that mr gleeson would not flog corrigan hard 
and fleming have say -PRON- would not because -PRON- be good of -PRON- play not to 
but that be not why 
a voice from far out on the playground cry all in 
and other voice cry all in 
all in 
during the writing lesson -PRON- sit with -PRON- arm fold listening to the slow scraping of the pen 
mr harford go to and fro make little sign in red pencil and sometimes sit beside the boy to show -PRON- how to hold -PRON- pen 
-PRON- have try to spell out the headline for -PRON- though -PRON- know already what -PRON- be for -PRON- be the last of the book 
zeal without prudence be like a ship adrift but the line of the letter be like fine invisible thread and -PRON- be only by close -PRON- right eye tight and stare out of the left eye that -PRON- could make out the full curve of the capital 
but mr harford be very decent and never get into a wax 
all the other master get into dreadful wax 
but why be -PRON- to suffer for what fellow in the high line do 
well have say that -PRON- have drink some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that -PRON- have be find out who have do -PRON- by the smell 
perhaps -PRON- have steal a monstrance to run away with and sell -PRON- somewhere 
that must have be a terrible sin to go in there quietly at night to open the dark press and steal the flash gold thing into which god be put on the altar in the middle of flower and candle at benediction while the incense go up in cloud at both side as the fellow swing the censer and dominic kelly sing the first part by -PRON- in the choir 
but god be not in -PRON- of course when -PRON- steal -PRON- 
but still -PRON- be a strange and a great sin even to touch -PRON- 
-PRON- think of -PRON- with deep awe a terrible and strange sin -PRON- thrill -PRON- to think of -PRON- in the silence when the pen scrape lightly 
but to drink the altar wine out of the press and be find out by the smell be a sin too but -PRON- be not terrible and strange 
-PRON- only make -PRON- feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine 
because on the day when -PRON- have make -PRON- first holy communion in the chapel -PRON- have shut -PRON- eye and open -PRON- mouth and put out -PRON- tongue a little and when the rector have stoop down to give -PRON- the holy communion -PRON- have smell a faint winy smell off the rector breath after the wine of the mass 
the word be beautiful wine 
-PRON- make -PRON- think of dark purple because the grape be dark purple that grow in greece outside house like white temple 
but the faint smell of the rector breath have make -PRON- feel a sick feeling on the morning of -PRON- first communion 
the day of -PRON- first communion be the happy day of -PRON- life 
and once a lot of general have ask napoleon what be the happy day of -PRON- life 
-PRON- think -PRON- would say the day -PRON- win some great battle or the day -PRON- be make an emperor 
but -PRON- say gentleman the happy day of -PRON- life be the day on which i make -PRON- first holy communion 
father arnall come in and the latin lesson begin and -PRON- remain still lean on the desk with -PRON- arm fold 
father arnall give out the themebook and -PRON- say that -PRON- be scandalous and that -PRON- be all to be write out again with the correction at once 
but the bad of all be theme because the page be stick together by a blot and father arnall hold -PRON- up by a corner and say -PRON- be an insult to any master to send -PRON- up such a theme 
then -PRON- ask jack lawton to decline the noun mare and jack lawton stop at the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural 
-PRON- should be ashamed of -PRON- say father arnall sternly 
-PRON- the leader of the class 
then -PRON- ask the next boy and the next and the next 
nobody know 
father arnall become very quiet more and more quiet as each boy try to answer -PRON- and could not 
but -PRON- face be blacklooke and -PRON- eye be stare though -PRON- voice be so quiet 
then -PRON- ask fleme and fleming say that the word have no plural 
father arnall suddenly shut the book and shout at -PRON- kneel out there in the middle of the class 
-PRON- be one of the idle boy i ever meet 
copy out -PRON- theme again the rest of -PRON- 
fleming move heavily out of -PRON- place and knelt between the two last bench 
the other boy bend over -PRON- themebook and begin to write 
a silence fill the classroom and stephen glance timidly at father dark face see that -PRON- be a little red from the wax -PRON- be in 
be that a sin for father arnall to be in a wax or be -PRON- allow to get into a wax when the boy be idle because that make -PRON- study better or be -PRON- only let on to be in a wax 
-PRON- be because -PRON- be allow because a priest would know what a sin be and would not do -PRON- 
but if -PRON- do -PRON- one time by mistake what would -PRON- do to go to confession 
perhaps -PRON- would go to confession to the minister 
and if the minister do -PRON- -PRON- would go to the rector and the rector to the provincial and the provincial to the general of the jesuit 
that be call the order and -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say that -PRON- be all clever man 
-PRON- could all have become highup people in the world if -PRON- have not become jesuit 
and -PRON- wonder what father arnall and paddy barrett would have become and what mr and mr gleeson would have become if -PRON- have not become jesuit 
-PRON- be hard to think what because -PRON- would have to think of -PRON- in a different way with different coloured coat and trouser and with beard and moustache and different kind of hat 
the door open quietly and closed 
a quick whisper run through the class the prefect of study 
there be an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk heart leap up in fear 
any boy want flog here father arnall cry the prefect of study 
any lazy idle loafer that want flog in this class 
-PRON- come to the middle of the class and see fleme on -PRON- knee

kneel down cry the prefect of study 
fleme knelt down squeeze -PRON- hand under -PRON- armpit -PRON- face contort with pain but stephen know how hard -PRON- hand be because fleming be always rub rosin into -PRON- 
but perhaps -PRON- be in great pain for the noise of the pandybat be terrible heart be beat and flutter 
at -PRON- work all of -PRON- shout the prefect of study 
-PRON- want no lazy idle loafer here lazy idle little schemer

stephen lift -PRON- eye in wonder and see for a moment father whitegrey not young face -PRON- baldy whitegrey head with fluff at the side of -PRON- the steel rim of -PRON- spectacle and -PRON- nocoloure eye look through the glass 
why do -PRON- say -PRON- know that trick 
lazy idle little loafer cry the prefect of study 
break -PRON- glass 
an old schoolboy trick 
out with -PRON- hand this moment 
stephen close -PRON- eye and hold out in the air -PRON- trembling hand with the palm upwards 
-PRON- feel the prefect of study touch -PRON- for a moment at the finger to straighten -PRON- and then the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat be lift to strike 
a hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a break stick make -PRON- trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire and at the sound and the pain scalding tear be drive into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- whole body be shake with fright -PRON- arm be shake and -PRON- crumple burn livid hand shake like a loose leaf in the air 
a cry spring to -PRON- lip a prayer to be let off 
but though the tear scald -PRON- eye and -PRON- limb quiver with pain and fright -PRON- hold back the hot tear and the cry that scald -PRON- throat 
other hand shout the prefect of study 
stephen draw back -PRON- maimed and quiver right arm and hold out -PRON- left hand 
the soutane sleeve swish again as the pandybat be lift and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingle burn pain make -PRON- hand shrink together with the palm and finger in a livid quivering mass 
the scald water burst forth from -PRON- eye and burn with shame and agony and fear -PRON- draw back -PRON- shake arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain 
-PRON- body shake with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage -PRON- feel the scald cry come from -PRON- throat and the scalding tear fall out of -PRON- eye and down -PRON- flaming cheek 
kneel down cry the prefect of study 
stephen knelt down quickly press -PRON- beat hand to -PRON- side 
to think of -PRON- beat and swell with pain all in a moment make -PRON- feel so sorry for -PRON- as if -PRON- be not -PRON- own but someone else that -PRON- feel sorry for 
and as -PRON- kneel calm the last sob in -PRON- throat and feel the burn tingle pain press into -PRON- side -PRON- think of the hand which -PRON- have hold out in the air with the palm up and of the firm touch of the prefect of study when -PRON- have steady the shake finger and of the beat swollen redden mass of palm and finger that shake helplessly in the air 
get at -PRON- work all of -PRON- cry the prefect of study from the door

the door close behind -PRON- 
the hush class continue to copy out the theme 
father arnall rise from -PRON- seat and go among -PRON- help the boy with gentle word and tell -PRON- the mistake -PRON- have make 
-PRON- voice be very gentle and soft 
then -PRON- return to -PRON- seat and say to fleme and stephen -PRON- may return to -PRON- place -PRON- two 
fleming and stephen rise and walk to -PRON- seat sit down 
stephen scarlet with shame open a book quickly with one weak hand and bend down upon -PRON- -PRON- face close to the page 
-PRON- be unfair and cruel because the doctor have tell -PRON- not to read without glass and -PRON- have write home to -PRON- father that morning to send -PRON- a new pair 
and father arnall have say that -PRON- nee not study till the new glass come 
then to be call a schemer before the class and to be pandy when -PRON- always get the card for first or second and be the leader of the yorkist 
how could the prefect of study know that -PRON- be a trick 
-PRON- feel the touch of the prefect finger as -PRON- have steady -PRON- hand and at first -PRON- have think -PRON- be go to shake hand with -PRON- because the finger be soft and firm but then in an instant -PRON- have hear the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash

-PRON- listen to father low and gentle voice as -PRON- correct the theme 
perhaps -PRON- be sorry now and want to be decent 
but -PRON- be unfair and cruel 
the prefect of study be a priest but that be cruel and unfair 
and -PRON- whitegrey face and the nocoloure eye behind the steel rim spectacle be cruel look because -PRON- have steady the hand first with -PRON- firm soft finger and that be to hit -PRON- better and louder a stink mean thing that s what -PRON- be say fleme in the corridor as the class be pass out in file to the refectory to pandy a fellow for what be not -PRON- fault

and there be some fellow out of second of grammar listening and one of -PRON- say the senate and the roman people declare that dedalus have be wrongly punish 
-PRON- be wrong -PRON- be unfair and cruel and as -PRON- sit in the refectory -PRON- suffer time after time in memory the same humiliation until -PRON- begin to wonder whether -PRON- may not really be that there be something in -PRON- face which make -PRON- look like a schemer and -PRON- wish -PRON- have a little mirror to see 
but there could not be and -PRON- be unjust and cruel and unfair 
-PRON- could not eat the blackish fish fritter -PRON- get on wednesday in lent and one of -PRON- potato have the mark of the spade in -PRON- 
yes -PRON- would do what the fellow have tell -PRON- 
-PRON- would go up and tell the rector that -PRON- have be wrongly punish 
a thing like that have be do before by somebody in history by some great person whose head be in the book of history 
and the rector would declare that -PRON- have be wrongly punish because the senate and the roman people always declare that the man who do that have be wrongly punish 
those be the great man whose name be in richmal question 
history be all about those man and what -PRON- do and that be what peter tale about greece and rome be all about 
peter parley -PRON- be on the first page in a picture 
there be a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bush and peter parley have a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and -PRON- be walk fast along the road to greece and rome 
-PRON- be easy what -PRON- have to do 
all -PRON- have to do be when the dinner be over and -PRON- come out in -PRON- turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that lead to the castle 
-PRON- have nothing to do but that to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute -PRON- would be in the low dark narrow corridor that lead through the castle to the rector room 
and every fellow have say that -PRON- be unfair even the fellow out of second of grammar who have say that about the senate and the roman people 
what would happen 
-PRON- hear the fellow of the high line stand up at the top of the refectory and hear -PRON- step as -PRON- come down the mat paddy rath and jimmy magee and the spaniard and the portuguese and the fifth be big corrigan who be go to be flog by mr gleeson 
that be why the prefect of study have call -PRON- a schemer and pandy -PRON- for nothing and strain -PRON- weak eye tired with the tear -PRON- watch big broad shoulder and big hang black head pass in the file 
but -PRON- have do something and besides mr gleeson would not flog -PRON- hard and -PRON- remember how big corrigan look in the bath 
-PRON- have skin the same colour as the turfcoloure bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when -PRON- walk along the side -PRON- foot slap loudly on the wet tile and at every step -PRON- thigh shake a little because -PRON- be fat 
the refectory be half empty and the fellow be still pass out in file 
-PRON- could go up the staircase because there be never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door 
but -PRON- could not go 
the rector would side with the prefect of study and think -PRON- be a schoolboy trick and then the prefect of study would come in every day the same only -PRON- would be bad because -PRON- would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow go up to the rector about -PRON- 
the fellow have tell -PRON- to go but -PRON- would not go -PRON- 
-PRON- have forget all about -PRON- 
no -PRON- be good to forget all about -PRON- and perhaps the prefect of study have only say -PRON- would come in 
no -PRON- be good to hide out of the way because when -PRON- be small and young -PRON- could often escape that way 
the fellow at -PRON- table stand up 
-PRON- stand up and pass out among -PRON- in the file 
-PRON- have to decide 
-PRON- be come near the door 
if -PRON- go on with the fellow -PRON- could never go up to the rector because -PRON- could not leave the playground for that 
and if -PRON- go and be pandy all the same all the fellow would make fun and talk about young dedalus go up to the rector to tell on the prefect of study 
-PRON- be walk down along the matting and -PRON- see the door before -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible -PRON- could not 
-PRON- think of the baldy head of the prefect of study with the cruel nocoloure eye look at -PRON- and -PRON- hear the voice of the prefect of study ask -PRON- twice what -PRON- name be 
why could -PRON- not remember the name when -PRON- be tell the first time 
be -PRON- not listen the first time or be -PRON- to make fun out of the name 
the great man in the history have name like that and nobody make fun of -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- own name that -PRON- should have make fun of if -PRON- want to make fun 
dolan -PRON- be like the name of a woman who wash clothe 
-PRON- have reach the door and turn quickly up to the right walk up the stair and before -PRON- could make up -PRON- mind to come back -PRON- have enter the low dark narrow corridor that lead to the castle 
and as -PRON- cross the threshold of the door of the corridor -PRON- see without turn -PRON- head to look that all the fellow be look after -PRON- as -PRON- go file by 
-PRON- pass along the narrow dark corridor pass little door that be the door of the room of the community 
-PRON- peer in front of -PRON- and right and leave through the gloom and think that those must be portrait 
-PRON- be dark and silent and -PRON- eye be weak and tired with tear so that -PRON- could not see 
but -PRON- think -PRON- be the portrait of the saint and great man of the order who be look down on -PRON- silently as -PRON- pass saint ignatius loyola hold an open book and point to the word ad majorem dei gloriam in -PRON- saint francis xavier point to -PRON- chest lorenzo ricci with -PRON- berretta on -PRON- head like one of the prefect of the line the three patron of holy youth saint stanislaus kostka saint aloysius gonzago and bless john berchman all with young face because -PRON- die when -PRON- be young and father peter kenny sit in a chair wrap in a big cloak 
-PRON- come out on the landing above the entrance hall and look about -PRON- 
that be where hamilton rowan have pass and the mark of the soldier slug be there 
and -PRON- be there that the old servant have see the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal 
an old servant be sweep at the end of the landing 
-PRON- ask -PRON- where be the rector room and the old servant point to the door at the far end and look after -PRON- as -PRON- go on to -PRON- and knock 
there be no answer 
-PRON- knock again more loudly and -PRON- heart jump when -PRON- hear a muffled voice say come in 
-PRON- turn the handle and open the door and fumble for the handle of the green baize door inside 
-PRON- find -PRON- and push -PRON- open and go in 
-PRON- see the rector sit at a desk writing 
there be a skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of chair 
-PRON- heart be beat fast on account of the solemn place -PRON- be in and the silence of the room and -PRON- look at the skull and at the rector kindlooke face

the rector look at -PRON- in silence and -PRON- could feel the blood rise to -PRON- face and the tear about to rise to -PRON- eye 
the rector say -PRON- name be dedalus isnot -PRON- 
yes sir

stephen feel the tear wet -PRON- eye and murmur yes sir thank 
the rector hold -PRON- hand across the side of the desk where the skull be and stephen place -PRON- hand in -PRON- for a moment feel a cool moist palm 
good day now say the rector withdraw -PRON- hand and bowing 
good day sir say stephen 
-PRON- bow and walk quietly out of the room close the door carefully and slowly 
but when -PRON- have pass the old servant on the landing and be again in the low narrow dark corridor -PRON- begin to walk faster and faster 
faster and faster -PRON- hurry on through the gloom excitedly 
-PRON- bump -PRON- elbow against the door at the end and hurry down the staircase walk quickly through the two corridor and out into the air 
-PRON- could hear the cry of the fellow on the playground 
-PRON- break into a run and run quicker and quicker run across the cinderpath and reach the third line playground pant 
the fellow have see -PRON- run 
-PRON- close round -PRON- in a ring push one against another to hear

-PRON- catch -PRON- cap and send -PRON- up again spin skyhigh and cry again hurroo 
hurroo 
-PRON- make a cradle of -PRON- lock hand and hoist -PRON- up among -PRON- and carry -PRON- along till -PRON- struggle to get free 
and when -PRON- have escape from -PRON- -PRON- break away in all direction fling -PRON- cap again into the air and whistle as -PRON- go spin up and cry hurroo 
and -PRON- give three groan for baldyhead dolan and three cheer for conmee and -PRON- say -PRON- be the decent rector that be ever in clongowes 
the cheer die away in the soft grey air 
-PRON- be alone 
-PRON- be happy and free but -PRON- would not be anyway proud with father dolan 
-PRON- would be very quiet and obedient and -PRON- wish that -PRON- could do something kind for -PRON- to show -PRON- that -PRON- be not proud 
the air be soft and grey and mild and evening be come 
there be the smell of evening in the air the smell of the field in the country where -PRON- digge up turnip to peel -PRON- and eat -PRON- when -PRON- go out for a walk to major the smell there be in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnut be 
the fellow be practise long shy and bowl lob and slow twister 
in the soft grey silence -PRON- could hear the bump of the ball and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the cricket bat pick pack pock puck like drop of water in a fountain fall softly in the brimming bowl 
chapter uncle charle smoke such black twist that at last -PRON- nephew suggest to -PRON- to enjoy -PRON- morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden 
very good simon 
all serene simon say the old man tranquilly 
anywhere -PRON- like 
the outhouse will do -PRON- nicely -PRON- will be more salubrious 
damn -PRON- say mr dedalus frankly if i know how -PRON- can smoke such villainous awful tobacco like gunpowder by god very nice simon reply the old man 
very cool and mollify 
every morning therefore uncle charle repair to -PRON- outhouse but not before -PRON- have grease and brush scrupulously -PRON- back hair and brush and put on -PRON- tall hat 
while -PRON- smoke the brim of -PRON- tall hat and the bowl of -PRON- pipe be just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door 
-PRON- arbour as -PRON- call the reek outhouse which -PRON- share with the cat and the garden tool serve -PRON- also as a soundingbox and every morning -PRON- hum contentedly one of -PRON- favourite song twine -PRON- a bower or blue eye and golden hair or the grove of blarney while the grey and blue coil of smoke rise slowly from -PRON- pipe and vanish in the pure air 
during the first part of the summer in blackrock uncle charle be constant companion 
uncle charle be a hale old man with a well tan skin rugge feature and white side whisker 
on week day -PRON- do message between the house in carysfort avenue and those shop in the main street of the town with which the family deal 
stephen be glad to go with -PRON- on these errand for uncle charle help -PRON- very liberally to handful of whatever be expose in open box and barrel outside the counter 
-PRON- would seize a handful of grape and sawdust or three or four american apple and thrust -PRON- generously into -PRON- grandnephews hand while the shopman smile uneasily and on feign reluctance to take -PRON- -PRON- would frown and say take -PRON- sir 
do -PRON- hear -PRON- sir good for -PRON- bowel 
when the order list have be book the two would go on to the park where an old friend of father mike flynn would be find seat on a bench wait for -PRON- 
then would begin run round the park 
mike flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station watch in hand while stephen run round the track in the style mike flynn favour -PRON- head high lift -PRON- knee well lift and -PRON- hand hold straight down by -PRON- side 
when the morning practice be over the trainer would make -PRON- comment and sometimes illustrate -PRON- by shuffle along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoe 
a small ring of wonderstruck child and nursemaid would gather to watch -PRON- and linger even when -PRON- and uncle charle have sit down again and be talk athletic and politic 
though -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say that mike flynn have put some of the good runner of modern time through -PRON- hand stephen often glance at -PRON- trainer flabby stubblecovered face as -PRON- bend over the long stain finger through which -PRON- roll -PRON- cigarette and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eye which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen finger cease -PRON- rolling and grain and fibre of tobacco fall back into the pouch 
on the way home uncle charle would often pay a visit to the chapel and as the font be above reach the old man would dip -PRON- hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about clothe and on the floor of the porch 
while -PRON- pray -PRON- kneel on -PRON- red handkerchief and read above -PRON- breath from a thumb blacken prayerbook wherein catchword be print at the foot of every page 
stephen knelt at -PRON- side respect though -PRON- do not share -PRON- piety 
-PRON- often wonder what -PRON- granduncle pray for so seriously 
perhaps -PRON- pray for the soul in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps -PRON- pray that god may send -PRON- back a part of the big fortune -PRON- have squander in cork 
on sunday stephen with -PRON- father and -PRON- granduncle take -PRON- constitutional 
the old man be a nimble walker in spite of -PRON- corn and often ten or twelve mile of the road be cover 
the little village of stillorgan be the parting of the way 
either -PRON- go to the left towards the dublin mountain or along the goatstown road and thence into dundrum come home by sandyford 
trudge along the road or stand in some grimy wayside public house -PRON- elder speak constantly of the subject nearer -PRON- heart of irish politic of munster and of the legend of -PRON- own family to all of which stephen lend an avid ear 
word which -PRON- do not understand -PRON- say over and over to -PRON- till -PRON- have learn -PRON- by heart and through -PRON- -PRON- have glimpse of the real world about -PRON- 
the hour when -PRON- too would take part in the life of that world seem draw near and in secret -PRON- begin to make ready for the great part which -PRON- feel await -PRON- the nature of which -PRON- only dimly apprehend 
-PRON- evening be -PRON- own and -PRON- pore over a ragged translation of the count of monte cristo 
the figure of that dark avenger stand forth in -PRON- mind for whatever -PRON- have hear or divine in childhood of the strange and terrible 
at night -PRON- build up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave out of transfer and paper flower and coloured tissue paper and strip of the silver and golden paper in which chocolate be wrap 
when -PRON- have break up this scenery weary of -PRON- tinsel there would come to -PRON- mind the bright picture of marseille of sunny trellis and of mercede 
outside blackrock on the road that lead to the mountain stand a small whitewash house in the garden of which grow many rosebush and in this house -PRON- tell -PRON- another mercede live 
both on the outward and on the homeward journey -PRON- measure distance by this landmark and in -PRON- imagination -PRON- live through a long train of adventure marvellous as those in the book -PRON- towards the close of which there appear an image of -PRON- grow old and sadder stand in a moonlit garden with mercede who have so many year before slight -PRON- love and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal say madam i never eat muscatel grape 
-PRON- become the ally of a boy name aubrey mill and found with -PRON- a gang of adventurer in the avenue 
aubrey carry a whistle dangle from -PRON- buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attach to -PRON- belt while the other have short stick thrust daggerwise through -PRON- 
stephen who have read of plain style of dress choose to remain unadorned and thereby heighten for -PRON- the pleasure of take counsel with -PRON- lieutenant before give order 
the gang make foray into the garden of old maid or go down to the castle and fight a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rock come home after -PRON- weary straggler with the stale odour of the foreshore in -PRON- nostril and the rank oil of the seawrack upon -PRON- hand and in -PRON- hair 
aubrey and stephen have a common milkman and often -PRON- drive out in the milkcar to carrickmine where the cow be at grass 
while the man be milk the boy would take turn in ride the tractable mare round the field 
but when autumn come the cow be drive home from the grass and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at stradbrook with -PRON- foul green puddle and clot of liquid dung and steam bran trough sicken heart 
the cattle which have seem so beautiful in the country on sunny day revolt -PRON- and -PRON- could not even look at the milk -PRON- yield 
the coming of september do not trouble -PRON- this year for -PRON- be not to be send back to clongowes 
the practice in the park come to an end when mike flynn go into hospital 
aubrey be at school and have only an hour or two free in the evening 
the gang fall asunder and there be no more nightly foray or battle on the rock 
stephen sometimes go round with the car which deliver the evening milk and these chilly drive blow away -PRON- memory of the filth of the cowyard and -PRON- feel no repugnance at see the cow hair and hayseed on the milkman coat 
whenever the car draw up before a house -PRON- wait to catch a glimpse of a well scrub kitchen or of a softly light hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how -PRON- would close the door 
-PRON- think -PRON- should be a pleasant life enough driving along the road every evening to deliver milk if -PRON- have warm glove and a fat bag of gingernut in -PRON- pocket to eat from 
but the same foreknowledge which have sicken -PRON- heart and make -PRON- leg sag suddenly as -PRON- race round the park the same intuition which have make -PRON- glance with mistrust at -PRON- trainer flabby stubblecovered face as -PRON- bend heavily over -PRON- long stained finger dissipate any vision of the future 
in a vague way -PRON- understand that -PRON- father be in trouble and that this be the reason why -PRON- -PRON- have not be send back to clongowes 
for some time -PRON- have feel the slight change in -PRON- house and those change in what -PRON- have deem unchangeable be so many slight shock to -PRON- boyish conception of the world 
the ambition which -PRON- feel astir at time in the darkness of -PRON- soul seek no outlet 
a dusk like that of the outer world obscure -PRON- mind as -PRON- hear the mare hoof clatter along the tramtrack on the rock road and the great can sway and rattle behind -PRON- 
-PRON- return to mercede and as -PRON- brood upon -PRON- image a strange unrest creep into -PRON- blood 
sometimes a fever gather within -PRON- and lead -PRON- to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue 
the peace of the garden and the kindly light in the window pour a tender influence into -PRON- restless heart 
the noise of child at play annoy -PRON- and -PRON- silly voice make -PRON- feel even more keenly than -PRON- have feel at clongowes that -PRON- be different from other 
-PRON- do not want to play 
-PRON- want to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which -PRON- soul so constantly behold 
-PRON- do not know where to seek -PRON- or how but a premonition which lead -PRON- on tell -PRON- that this image would without any overt act of -PRON- encounter -PRON- 
-PRON- would meet quietly as if -PRON- have know each other and have make -PRON- tryst perhaps at one of the gate or in some more secret place 
-PRON- would be alone surround by darkness and silence and in that moment of supreme tenderness -PRON- would be transfigure 
-PRON- would fade into something impalpable under -PRON- eye and then in a moment -PRON- would be transfigure 
weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from -PRON- in that magic moment 
two great yellow caravan have halt one morning before the door and man have come tramp into the house to dismantle -PRON- 
the furniture have be hustle out through the front garden which be strew with wisps of straw and rope end and into the huge van at the gate 
when all have be safely stow the van have set off noisily down the avenue and from the window of the railway carriage in which -PRON- have sit with -PRON- redeyed mother stephen have see -PRON- lumber along the merrion road 
the parlour fire would not draw that evening and mr dedalus rest the poker against the bar of the grate to attract the flame 
uncle charle doze in a corner of the half furnish uncarpeted room and near -PRON- the family portrait lean against the wall 
the lamp on the table shed a weak light over the boarded floor muddy by the foot of the vanman 
stephen sit on a footstool beside -PRON- father listen to a long and incoherent monologue 
-PRON- understand little or nothing of -PRON- at first but -PRON- become slowly aware that -PRON- father have enemy and that some fight be go to take place 
-PRON- feel too that -PRON- be be enlist for the fight that some duty be be lay upon -PRON- shoulder 
the sudden flight from the comfort and reverie of blackrock the passage through the gloomy foggy city the thought of the bare cheerless house in which -PRON- be now to live make -PRON- heart heavy and again an intuition a foreknowledge of the future come to -PRON- 
-PRON- understand also why the servant have often whisper together in the hall and why -PRON- father have often stand on the hearthrug with -PRON- back to the fire talk loudly to uncle charle who urge -PRON- to sit down and eat -PRON- dinner a crack of the whip leave in -PRON- yet stephen old chap say mr dedalus poking at the dull fire with fierce energy not dead yet sonny 
no by the lord jesus god forgive -PRON- nor half dead 
dublin be a new and complex sensation 
uncle charle have grow so witless that -PRON- could no longer be send out on errand and the disorder in settle in the new house leave stephen free than -PRON- have be in blackrock 
in the beginning -PRON- content -PRON- with circle timidly round the neighbouring square or at most go half way down one of the side street but when -PRON- have make a skeleton map of the city in -PRON- mind -PRON- follow boldly one of -PRON- central line until -PRON- reach the custom house 
-PRON- pass unchallenged among the dock and along the quay wonder at the multitude of cork that lay bob on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum at the crowd of quay porter and the rumble cart and the illdresse bearded policeman 
the vastness and strangeness of the life suggest to -PRON- by the bale of merchandise stock along the wall or swing aloft out of the hold of steamer waken again in -PRON- the unrest which have send -PRON- wander in the evening from garden to garden in search of mercede 
and amid this new bustling life -PRON- may have fancy -PRON- in another marseille but that -PRON- miss the bright sky and the sunwarmed trellis of the wineshop 
a vague dissatisfaction grow up within -PRON- as -PRON- look on the quay and on the river and on the lower sky and yet -PRON- continue to wander up and down day after day as if -PRON- really seek someone that elude -PRON- 
-PRON- go once or twice with -PRON- mother to visit -PRON- relative and though -PRON- pass a jovial array of shop light up and adorn for christmas -PRON- mood of embittered silence do not leave -PRON- 
the cause of -PRON- embitterment be many remote and near 
-PRON- be angry with -PRON- for be young and the prey of restless foolish impulse angry also with the change of fortune which be reshape the world about -PRON- into a vision of squalor and insincerity 
yet -PRON- anger lend nothing to the vision 
-PRON- chronicle with patience what -PRON- see detach -PRON- from -PRON- and taste -PRON- mortify flavour in secret 
-PRON- be sit on the backless chair in -PRON- aunt kitchen 
a lamp with a reflector hang on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by -PRON- light -PRON- aunt be read the evening paper that lie on -PRON- knee 
-PRON- look a long time at a smile picture that be set in -PRON- and say musingly the beautiful mabel hunter 
a ringletted girl stand on tiptoe to peer at the picture and say softly what be -PRON- in mud 
in a pantomime love 
the child lean -PRON- ringletted head against -PRON- mother sleeve gaze on the picture and murmur as if fascinate the beautiful mabel hunter 
as if fascinate -PRON- eye rest long upon those demurely taunt eye and -PRON- murmur devotedly -PRON- an exquisite creature 
and the boy who come in from the street stamp crookedly under -PRON- stone of coal hear -PRON- word 
-PRON- drop -PRON- load promptly on the floor and hurry to -PRON- side to see 
-PRON- maul the edge of the paper with -PRON- redden and blacken hand shoulder -PRON- aside and complain that -PRON- could not see 
-PRON- be sit in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old darkwindowed house 
the firelight flicker on the wall and beyond the window a spectral dusk be gather upon the river 
before the fire an old woman be busy make tea and as -PRON- bustle at the task -PRON- tell in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor have say 
-PRON- tell too of certain change -PRON- have see in -PRON- of late and of -PRON- odd way and saying 
-PRON- sit listen to the word and follow the way of adventure that lie open in the coal arch and vault and wind gallery and jagged cavern 
suddenly -PRON- become aware of something in the doorway 
a skull appear suspend in the gloom of the doorway 
a feeble creature like a monkey be there draw thither by the sound of voice at the fire 
a whine voice come from the door ask be that josephine 
the old bustling woman answer cheerily from the fireplace no ellen -PRON- stephen good evening stephen 
-PRON- answer the greeting and see a silly smile break over the face in the doorway 
do -PRON- want anything ellen ask the old woman at the fire 
but -PRON- do not answer the question and say think -PRON- be josephine 
i think -PRON- be josephine stephen 
and repeat this several time -PRON- fall to laugh feebly 
-PRON- be sit in the midst of a children party at cross 
-PRON- silent watchful manner have grow upon -PRON- and -PRON- take little part in the game 
the child wear the spoil of -PRON- cracker dance and romp noisily and though -PRON- try to share -PRON- merriment -PRON- feel -PRON- a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hat and sunbonnet 
but when -PRON- have sing -PRON- song and withdraw into a snug corner of the room -PRON- begin to taste the joy of -PRON- loneliness 
the mirth which in the beginning of the evening have seem to -PRON- false and trivial be like a soothe air to -PRON- pass gaily by -PRON- sense hide from other eye the feverish agitation of -PRON- blood while through the circling of the dancer and amid the music and laughter -PRON- glance travel to -PRON- corner flatter taunt search exciting -PRON- heart 
in the hall the child who have stay latest be put on -PRON- thing the party be over 
-PRON- have throw a shawl about -PRON- and as -PRON- go together towards the tram spray of -PRON- fresh warm breath fly gaily above -PRON- cowl head and -PRON- shoe tap blithely on the glassy road 
-PRON- be the last tram 
the lank brown horse know -PRON- and shake -PRON- bell to the clear night in admonition 
the conductor talk with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp 
on the empty seat of the tram be scatter a few coloured ticket 
no sound of footstep come up or down the road 
no sound break the peace of the night save when the lank brown horse rub -PRON- nose together and shake -PRON- bell 
-PRON- seem to listen -PRON- on the upper step and -PRON- on the low 
-PRON- come up to -PRON- step many time and go down to -PRON- again between -PRON- phrase and once or twice stand close beside -PRON- for some moment on the upper step forget to go down and then go down 
-PRON- heart dance upon -PRON- movement like a cork upon a tide 
-PRON- hear what -PRON- eye say to -PRON- from beneath -PRON- cowl and know that in some dim past whether in life or reverie -PRON- have hear -PRON- tale before 
-PRON- see -PRON- urge -PRON- vanity -PRON- fine dress and sash and long black stocking and know that -PRON- have yield to -PRON- a thousand time 
yet a voice within -PRON- speak above the noise of -PRON- dancing heart ask -PRON- would -PRON- take -PRON- gift to which -PRON- have only to stretch out -PRON- hand 
and -PRON- remember the day when -PRON- and eileen have stand look into the hotel ground watch the waiter run up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scamper to and fro on the sunny lawn and how all of a sudden -PRON- have break out into a peal of laughter and have run down the slope curve of the path 
now as then -PRON- stand listlessly in -PRON- place seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before -PRON- 
-PRON- too want -PRON- to catch hold of -PRON- -PRON- think why -PRON- come with -PRON- to the tram 
i could easily catch hold of -PRON- when -PRON- come up to -PRON- step nobody be look 
i could hold -PRON- and kiss -PRON- 
but -PRON- do neither and when -PRON- be sit alone in the deserted tram -PRON- tear -PRON- ticket into shred and stare gloomily at the corrugate footboard 
the next day -PRON- sit at -PRON- table in the bare upper room for many hour 
before -PRON- lie a new pen a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise 
from force of habit -PRON- have write at the top of the first page the initial letter of the jesuit motto on the first line of the page appear the title of the verse -PRON- be try to write to -PRON- know -PRON- be right to begin so for -PRON- have see similar title in the collected poem of lord byron 
when -PRON- have write this title and draw an ornamental line underneath -PRON- fall into a daydream and begin to draw diagram on the cover of the book 
-PRON- see -PRON- sit at -PRON- table in bray the morning after the discussion at the christmas dinner table try to write a poem about parnell on the back of one of -PRON- father second moiety notice 
but -PRON- brain have then refuse to grapple with the theme and desist -PRON- have cover the page with the name and address of certain of -PRON- classmate roderick kickham john lawton anthony simon moonan now -PRON- seem as if -PRON- would fail again but by dint of brood on the incident -PRON- think -PRON- into confidence 
during this process all those element which -PRON- deem common and insignificant fall out of the scene 
there remain no trace of the tram -PRON- nor of the tramman nor of the horse nor do -PRON- and -PRON- appear vividly 
the verse tell only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon 
some undefined sorrow be hide in the heart of the protagonist as -PRON- stand in silence beneath the leafless tree and when the moment of farewell have come the kiss which have be withhold by one be give by both 
after this the letter be write at the foot of the page and have hide the book -PRON- go into -PRON- mother bedroom and gaze at -PRON- face for a long time in the mirror of -PRON- dressingtable 
but -PRON- long spell of leisure and liberty be draw to -PRON- end 
one evening -PRON- father come home full of news which keep -PRON- tongue busy all through dinner 
stephen have be await -PRON- father return for there have be mutton hash that day and -PRON- know that -PRON- father would make -PRON- dip -PRON- bread in the gravy

the night of the whitsuntide play have come and stephen from the window of the dressingroom look out on the small grassplot across which line of chinese lantern be stretch 
-PRON- watch the visitor come down the step from the house and pass into the theatre 
steward in evening dress old belvederean loiter in group about the entrance to the theatre and usher in the visitor with ceremony 
under the sudden glow of a lantern -PRON- could recognise the smile face of a priest 
the bless sacrament have be remove from the tabernacle and the first bench have be drive back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space before -PRON- free 
against the wall stand company of barbell and indian club the dumbbell be pile in one corner and in the midst of countless hillock of gymnasium shoe and sweater and singlet in untidy brown parcel there stand the stout leatherjackete vaulting horse wait -PRON- turn to be carry up on the stage and set in the middle of the win team at the end of the gymnastic display 
stephen though in deference to -PRON- reputation for essay writing -PRON- have be elect secretary to the gymnasium have have no part in the first section of the programme but in the play which form the second section -PRON- have the chief part that of a farcical pedagogue 
-PRON- have be cast for -PRON- on account of -PRON- stature and grave manner for -PRON- be now at the end of -PRON- second year at belvedere and in number two 
a score of the young boy in white knicker and singlet come patter down from the stage through the vestry and into the chapel 
the vestry and chapel be people with eager master and boy 
the plump bald sergeant major be test with -PRON- foot the springboard of the vaulting horse 
the lean young man in a long overcoat who be to give a special display of intricate club swinging stand near watch with interest -PRON- silvercoated club peep out of -PRON- deep sidepocket 
the hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbell be hear as another team make ready to go up on the stage and in another moment the excited prefect be hustle the boy through the vestry like a flock of geese flap the wing of -PRON- soutane nervously and cry to the laggard to make haste 
a little troop of neapolitan peasant be practise -PRON- step at the end of the chapel some circle -PRON- arm above -PRON- head some sway -PRON- basket of paper violet and curtseying 
in a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid -PRON- copious black skirt 
when -PRON- stand up a pinkdressed figure wear a curly golden wig and an oldfashione straw sunbonnet with black pencil eyebrow and cheek delicately rouge and powder be discover 
a low murmur of curiosity run round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure 
one of the prefect smile and nod -PRON- head approach the dark corner and have bow to the stout old lady say pleasantly be this a beautiful young lady or a doll that -PRON- have here mrs tallon 
then bend down to peer at the smile paint face under the leaf of the bonnet -PRON- exclaim no 
upon -PRON- word i believe -PRON- little bertie tallon after all 
stephen at -PRON- post by the window hear the old lady and the priest laugh together and hear the boy murmur of admiration behind -PRON- as -PRON- pass forward to see the little boy who have to dance the sunbonnet dance by -PRON- 
a movement of impatience escape -PRON- 
-PRON- let the edge of the blind fall and step down from the bench on which -PRON- have be stand walk out of the chapel 
-PRON- pass out of the schoolhouse and halt under the shed that flank the garden 
from the theatre opposite come the muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clash of the soldier band 
the light spread upwards from the glass roof make the theatre seem a festive ark anchor among the hulk of house -PRON- frail cable of lantern loop -PRON- to -PRON- mooring 
a side door of the theatre open suddenly and a shaft of light fly across the grassplot 
a sudden burst of music issue from the ark the prelude of a waltz and when the side door close again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music 
the sentiment of the opening bar -PRON- languor and supple movement evoke the incommunicable emotion which have be the cause of all -PRON- day unrest and of -PRON- impatient movement of a moment before 
-PRON- unrest issue from -PRON- like a wave of sound and on the tide of flow music the ark be journey trail -PRON- cable of lantern in -PRON- wake 
then a noise like dwarf artillery break the movement 
-PRON- be the clapping that greet the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage 
at the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light show in the darkness and as -PRON- walk towards -PRON- -PRON- become aware of a faint aromatic odour 
two boy be stand in the shelter of a doorway smoking and before -PRON- reach -PRON- -PRON- have recognise heron by -PRON- voice 
here come the noble dedalus cry a high throaty voice 
welcome to -PRON- trusty friend 
this welcome end in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as heron salaamed and then begin to poke the ground with -PRON- cane 
here i be say stephen halting and glance from heron to -PRON- friend 
the latter be a stranger to -PRON- but in the darkness by the aid of the glow cigarette tip -PRON- could make out a pale dandyish face over which a smile be travel slowly a tall overcoate figure and a hard hat 
heron do not trouble -PRON- about an introduction but say instead be just tell -PRON- friend wallis what a lark -PRON- would be tonight if -PRON- take off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster 
-PRON- would be a rip good joke 
heron make a poor attempt to imitate for -PRON- friend wallis the rector pedantic bass and then laugh at -PRON- failure ask stephen to do -PRON- 
go on dedalus -PRON- urge -PRON- can take -PRON- off rippingly 
-PRON- that will not hear the churcha let -PRON- be to theea as the heathena and the publicana the imitation be prevent by a mild expression of anger from wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette have become too tightly wedge 
damn this blankety blank holder -PRON- say take -PRON- from -PRON- mouth and smile and frowning upon -PRON- tolerantly always get stuck like that 
do -PRON- use a holder donot smoke answer stephen 
no say heron dedalus be a model youth 
-PRON- doesnot smoke and -PRON- doesnot go to bazaar and -PRON- doesnot flirt and -PRON- doesnot damn anything or damn all 
stephen shake -PRON- head and smile in -PRON- rival flush and mobile face beak like a bird 
-PRON- have often think -PRON- strange that vincent heron have a bird face as well as a bird name 
a shock of pale hair lie on the forehead like a ruffle crest the forehead be narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stand out between the closeset prominent eye which be light and inexpressive 
the rival be school friend 
-PRON- sit together in class knelt together in the chapel talk together after bead over -PRON- lunch 
as the fellow in number one be undistinguished dullard stephen and heron have be during the year the virtual head of the school 
-PRON- be -PRON- who go up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off by the way say heron suddenly i see -PRON- governor go in 
the smile wane on face 
any allusion make to -PRON- father by a fellow or by a master put -PRON- calm to rout in a moment 
-PRON- wait in timorous silence to hear what heron may say next 
heron however nudge -PRON- expressively with -PRON- elbow and say a sly dog 
why so say stephen think butter wouldnot melt in -PRON- mouth say heron 
but afraid -PRON- be a sly dog 
may i ask -PRON- what -PRON- be talk about say stephen urbanely 
indeed -PRON- may answer heron 
-PRON- see -PRON- wallis didnot -PRON- 
and deucedly pretty -PRON- be too 
and inquisitive 
and what part do stephen take mr dedalus 
and will stephen not sing mr dedalus -PRON- governor be stare at -PRON- through that eyeglass of -PRON- for all -PRON- be worth so that i think the old man have find -PRON- out too 
i wouldnot care a bit by jove rip isnot -PRON- wallis 
not half bad answered wallis quietly as -PRON- place -PRON- holder once more in a corner of -PRON- mouth 
a shaft of momentary anger fly through mind at these indelicate allusion in the hearing of a stranger 
for -PRON- there be nothing amusing in a girls interest and regard 
all day -PRON- have think of nothing but -PRON- leavetaking on the step of the tram at cross the stream of moody emotion -PRON- have make to course through -PRON- and the poem -PRON- have write about -PRON- 
all day -PRON- have imagine a new meeting with -PRON- for -PRON- know that -PRON- be to come to the play 
the old restless moodiness have again fill -PRON- breast as -PRON- have do on the night of the party but have not find an outlet in verse 
the growth and knowledge of two year of boyhood stand between then and now forbid such an outlet and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within -PRON- have start forth and return upon -PRON- in dark course and eddy weary -PRON- in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the paint little boy have draw from -PRON- a movement of impatience 
so -PRON- may as well admit heron go on that -PRON- have fairly find -PRON- out this time 
-PRON- canot play the saint on -PRON- any more that s one sure five 
a soft peal of mirthless laughter escape from -PRON- lip and bend down as before -PRON- strike stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with -PRON- cane as if in jesting reproof moment of anger have already pass 
-PRON- be neither flatter nor confused but simply wish the banter to end 
-PRON- scarcely resent what have seem to -PRON- a silly indelicateness for -PRON- know that the adventure in -PRON- mind stand in no danger from these word and -PRON- face mirror -PRON- rival false smile 
admit repeat heron strike -PRON- again with -PRON- cane across the calf of the leg 
the stroke be playful but not so lightly give as the first one have be 
stephen feel the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly and bow submissively as if to meet -PRON- companion jest mood begin to recite the confiteor 
the episode end well for both heron and wallis laugh indulgently at the irreverence 
the confession come only from lip and while -PRON- speak the word a sudden memory have carry -PRON- to another scene call up as if by magic at the moment when -PRON- have note the faint cruel dimple at the corner of smile lip and have feel the familiar stroke of the cane against -PRON- calf and have hear the familiar word of admonition admit 
-PRON- be towards the close of -PRON- first term in the college when -PRON- be in number six 
-PRON- sensitive nature be still smart under the lash of an undivined and squalid way of life 
-PRON- soul be still disquiet and cast down by the dull phenomenon of dublin 
-PRON- have emerge from a two year spell of reverie to find -PRON- in the midst of a new scene every event and figure of which affect -PRON- intimately dishearten -PRON- or allure and whether allure or disheartening fill -PRON- always with unrest and bitter thought 
all the leisure which -PRON- school life leave -PRON- be pass in the company of subversive writer whose gibe and violence of speech set up a ferment in -PRON- brain before -PRON- pass out of -PRON- into -PRON- crude writing 
the essay be for -PRON- the chief labour of -PRON- week and every tuesday as -PRON- march from home to the school -PRON- read -PRON- fate in the incident of the way pit -PRON- against some figure ahead of -PRON- and quicken -PRON- pace to outstrip -PRON- before a certain goal be reach or plant -PRON- step scrupulously in the space of the patchwork of the pathway and tell -PRON- that -PRON- would be first and not first in the weekly essay 
on a certain tuesday the course of -PRON- triumph be rudely break 
mr tate the english master point -PRON- finger at -PRON- and say bluntly this fellow have heresy in -PRON- essay 
a hush fall on the class 
mr tate do not break -PRON- but dig with -PRON- hand between -PRON- thigh while -PRON- heavily starch linen creak about -PRON- neck and wrist 
stephen do not look up 
-PRON- be a raw spring morning and -PRON- eye be still smart and weak 
-PRON- be conscious of failure and of detection of the squalor of -PRON- own mind and home and feel against -PRON- neck the raw edge of -PRON- turned and jagged collar 
a short loud laugh from mr tate set the class more at ease 
perhaps -PRON- didnot know that -PRON- say 
where ask stephen 
mr tate withdraw -PRON- delving hand and spread out the essay 
here about the creator and the soul 
rrm rrm rrm 
ah 
without a possibility of ever approach near heresy 
stephen murmur mean without a possibility of ever reach 
-PRON- be a submission and mr tate appease fold up the essay and pass -PRON- across to -PRON- say ah 
ever reach another story 
but the class be not so soon appeased 
though nobody speak to -PRON- of the affair after class -PRON- could feel about -PRON- a vague general malignant joy 
a few night after this public chide -PRON- be walk with a letter along the drumcondra road when -PRON- hear a voice cry halt 
-PRON- turn and see three boy of -PRON- own class come towards -PRON- in the dusk 
-PRON- be heron who have call out and as -PRON- march forward between -PRON- two attendant -PRON- cleave the air before -PRON- with a thin cane in time to -PRON- step 
boland -PRON- friend march beside -PRON- a large grin on -PRON- face while nash come on a few step behind blow from the pace and wag -PRON- great red head 
as soon as the boy have turn into clonliffe road together -PRON- begin to speak about book and writer say what book -PRON- be read and how many book there be in -PRON- father bookcase at home 
stephen listen to -PRON- in some wonderment for boland be the dunce and nash the idler of the class 
in fact after some talk about -PRON- favourite writer nash declare for captain marryat who -PRON- say be the great writer

the grin broaden on freckle face as -PRON- turn to stephen and say and do -PRON- like cardinal newman dedalus many say that newman have the good prose style heron say to the other two in explanation of course -PRON- s not a poet 
and who be the good poet heron ask boland

everyone know that tennyson be the great poet 
and who do -PRON- think be the great poet ask boland nudge -PRON- neighbour

heron give the lead and all three join in a scornful laugh 
what be -PRON- laugh at ask stephen 
-PRON- say heron 
byron the great poet only a poet for uneducated people 
-PRON- must be a fine poet say boland 
-PRON- may keep -PRON- mouth shut say stephen turn on -PRON- boldly 
all -PRON- know about poetry be what -PRON- write up on the slate in the yard and be go to be send to the loft for 
boland in fact be say to have write on the slate in the yard a couplet about a classmate of -PRON- who often ride home from the college on a pony as tyson be ride into jerusalem -PRON- fall and hurt -PRON- alec kafoozelum 
this thrust put the two lieutenant to silence but heron go on in any case byron be a heretic and immoral too donot care what -PRON- be cry stephen hotly 
-PRON- donot care whether -PRON- be a heretic or not say nash 
what do -PRON- know about -PRON- shout stephen 
-PRON- never read a line of anything in -PRON- life except a trans or boland either know that byron be a bad man say boland 
here catch hold of this heretic heron call out

nash pinion -PRON- arm behind while boland seize a long cabbage stump which be lie in the gutter 
struggle and kick under the cut of the cane and the blow of the knotty stump stephen be bear back against a barbed wire fence 
admit that byron be no good 
no

admit

no 
at last after a fury of plunge -PRON- wrench -PRON- free 
-PRON- tormentor set off towards road laugh and jeer at -PRON- while -PRON- half blind with tear stumble on clench -PRON- fist madly and sob 
while -PRON- be still repeat the confiteor amid the indulgent laughter of -PRON- hearer and while the scene of that malignant episode be still pass sharply and swiftly before -PRON- mind -PRON- wonder why -PRON- bear no malice now to those who have torment -PRON- 
-PRON- have not forget a whit of -PRON- cowardice and cruelty but the memory of -PRON- call forth no anger from -PRON- 
all the description of fierce love and hatred which -PRON- have meet in book have seem to -PRON- therefore unreal 
even that night as -PRON- stumble homeward along road -PRON- have feel that some power be divest -PRON- of that suddenwoven anger as easily as a fruit be divest of -PRON- soft ripe peel 
-PRON- remain stand with -PRON- two companion at the end of the shed listen idly to -PRON- talk or to the burst of applause in the theatre 
-PRON- be sit there among the other perhaps wait for -PRON- to appear 
-PRON- try to recall -PRON- appearance but could not 
-PRON- could remember only that -PRON- have wear a shawl about -PRON- head like a cowl and that -PRON- dark eye have invite and unnerve -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder have -PRON- be in -PRON- thought as -PRON- have be in -PRON- 
then in the dark and unseen by the other two -PRON- rest the tip of the finger of one hand upon the palm of the other hand scarcely touch -PRON- lightly 
but the pressure of -PRON- finger have be light and steady and suddenly the memory of -PRON- touch traverse -PRON- brain and body like an invisible wave 
a boy come towards -PRON- run along under the shed 
-PRON- be excited and breathless 
dedalus -PRON- cry doyle be in a great bake about -PRON- to go in at once and get dressed for the play 
hurry up -PRON- better come now say heron to the messenger with a haughty drawl when -PRON- want to 
the boy turn to heron and repeat but doyle be in an awful bake 
will -PRON- tell doyle with -PRON- good compliment that i damn -PRON- eye answer heron 
well i must go now say stephen who care little for such point of honour wouldnot say heron damn -PRON- if i would no way to send for one of the senior boy 
in a bake indeed 
i think -PRON- quite enough that -PRON- be take a part in -PRON- bally old play 
this spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which -PRON- have observe lately in -PRON- rival have not seduce stephen from -PRON- habit of quiet obedience 
-PRON- mistrust the turbulence and doubt the sincerity of such comradeship which seem to -PRON- a sorry anticipation of manhood 
the question of honour here raise be like all such question trivial to -PRON- 
while -PRON- mind have be pursue -PRON- intangible phantom and turn in irresolution from such pursuit -PRON- have hear about -PRON- the constant voice of -PRON- father and of -PRON- master urge -PRON- to be a gentleman above all thing and urge -PRON- to be a good catholic above all thing 
these voice have now come to be hollowsounde in -PRON- ear 
when the gymnasium have be open -PRON- have hear another voice urge -PRON- to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival have begin to be feel in the college yet another voice have bid -PRON- be true to -PRON- country and help to raise up -PRON- language and tradition 
in the profane world as -PRON- foresee a worldly voice would bid -PRON- raise up -PRON- father fall state by -PRON- labour and meanwhile the voice of -PRON- school comrade urge -PRON- to be a decent fellow to shield other from blame or to beg -PRON- off and to do -PRON- good to get free day for the school 
and -PRON- be the din of all these hollowsounde voice that make -PRON- halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantom 
-PRON- give -PRON- ear only for a time but -PRON- be happy only when -PRON- be far from -PRON- beyond -PRON- call alone or in the company of phantasmal comrade 
in the vestry a plump freshface jesuit and an elderly man in shabby blue clothe be dabble in a case of paint and chalks 
the boy who have be paint walk about or stand still awkwardly touch -PRON- face in a gingerly fashion with -PRON- furtive fingertip 
in the middle of the vestry a young jesuit who be then on a visit to the college stand rock -PRON- rhythmically from the tip of -PRON- toe to -PRON- heel and back again -PRON- hand thrust well forward into -PRON- sidepocket 
-PRON- small head set off with glossy red curl and -PRON- newly shaven face agree well with the spotless decency of -PRON- soutane and with -PRON- spotless shoe 
as -PRON- watch this swaying form and try to read for -PRON- the legend of the priest mocking smile there come into memory a saying which -PRON- have hear from -PRON- father before -PRON- have be send to clongowes that -PRON- could always tell a jesuit by the style of -PRON- clothe 
at the same moment -PRON- think -PRON- see a likeness between -PRON- father mind and that of this smile welldressed priest and -PRON- be aware of some desecration of the priest office or of the vestry -PRON- whose silence be now route by loud talk and joking and -PRON- air pungent with the smell of the gasjet and the grease 
while -PRON- forehead be be wrinkle and -PRON- jaw paint black and blue by the elderly man -PRON- listen distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit which bid -PRON- speak up and make -PRON- point clearly 
-PRON- could hear the band play the lily of killarney and know that in a few moment the curtain would go up 
-PRON- feel no stage fright but the thought of the part -PRON- have to play humiliate -PRON- 
a remembrance of some of -PRON- line make a sudden flush rise to -PRON- paint cheek 
-PRON- see -PRON- serious alluring eye watch -PRON- from among the audience and -PRON- image at once sweep away -PRON- scruple leave -PRON- will compact 
another nature seem to have be lend -PRON- the infection of the excitement and youth about -PRON- enter into and transform -PRON- moody mistrustfulness 
for one rare moment -PRON- seem to be clothe in the real apparel of boyhood and as -PRON- stand in the wing among the other player -PRON- share the common mirth amid which the drop scene be haul upwards by two ablebodie priest with violent jerk and all awry 
a few moment after -PRON- find -PRON- on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery act before the innumerable face of the void 
-PRON- surprise -PRON- to see that the play which -PRON- have know at rehearsal for a disjointed lifeless thing have suddenly assume a life of -PRON- own 
-PRON- seem now to play -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- fellow actor aid -PRON- with -PRON- part 
when the curtain fall on the last scene -PRON- hear the void fill with applause and through a rift in a side scene see the simple body before which -PRON- have act magically deform the void of face break at all point and fall asunder into busy group 
-PRON- leave the stage quickly and rid -PRON- of -PRON- mummery and pass out through the chapel into the college garden 
now that the play be over -PRON- nerve cry for some further adventure 
-PRON- hurry onwards as if to overtake -PRON- 
the door of the theatre be all open and the audience have empty out 
on the line which -PRON- have fancy the mooring of an ark a few lantern swing in the night breeze flicker cheerlessly 
-PRON- mount the step from the garden in haste eager that some prey should not elude -PRON- and force -PRON- way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuit who stand watch the exodus and bow and shake hand with the visitor 
-PRON- push onward nervously feign a still great haste and faintly conscious of the smile and stare and nudge which -PRON- powder head leave in -PRON- wake 
when -PRON- come out on the step -PRON- see -PRON- family wait for -PRON- at the first lamp 
in a glance -PRON- note that every figure of the group be familiar and run down the step angrily have to leave a message down in street -PRON- say to -PRON- father quickly be home after -PRON- 
without wait for -PRON- father question -PRON- run across the road and begin to walk at breakneck speed down the hill 
-PRON- hardly know where -PRON- be walk 
pride and hope and desire like crush herb in -PRON- heart send up vapour of madden incense before the eye of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- stride down the hill amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapour of wound pride and fall hope and baffled desire 
-PRON- stream upwards before -PRON- anguished eye in dense and maddening fume and pass away above -PRON- till at last the air be clear and cold again 
a film still veil -PRON- eye but -PRON- burn no longer 
a power akin to that which have often make anger or resentment fall from -PRON- bring -PRON- step to rest 
-PRON- stand still and gaze up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the dark cobble laneway at -PRON- side 
-PRON- see the word lott on the wall of the lane and breathe slowly the rank heavy air 
that be horse piss and rot straw -PRON- think 
-PRON- be a good odour to breathe 
-PRON- will calm -PRON- heart 
-PRON- heart be quite calm now 
i will go back 
stephen be once again seat beside -PRON- father in the corner of a railway carriage at kingsbridge 
-PRON- be travel with -PRON- father by the night mail to cork 
as the train steam out of the station -PRON- recall -PRON- childish wonder of year before and every event of -PRON- first day at clongowes 
but -PRON- feel no wonder now 
-PRON- see the darkening land slip away past -PRON- the silent telegraphpole pass -PRON- window swiftly every four second the little glimmering station man by a few silent sentry fling by the mail behind -PRON- and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grain fling backwards by a runner 
-PRON- listen without sympathy to -PRON- father evocation of cork and of scene of -PRON- youth a tale break by sigh or draught from -PRON- pocket flask whenever the image of some dead friend appear in -PRON- or whenever the evoker remember suddenly the purpose of -PRON- actual visit 
stephen hear but could feel no pity 
the image of the dead be all stranger to -PRON- save that of uncle charle an image which have lately be fade out of memory 
-PRON- know however that -PRON- father property be go to be sell by auction and in the manner of -PRON- own dispossession -PRON- feel the world give the lie rudely to -PRON- phantasy 
at maryborough -PRON- fall asleep 
when -PRON- awake the train have pass out of mallow and -PRON- father be stretch asleep on the other seat 
the cold light of the dawn lie over the country over the unpeopled field and the closed cottage 
the terror of sleep fascinate -PRON- mind as -PRON- watch the silent country or hear from time to time -PRON- father deep breath or sudden sleepy movement 
the neighbourhood of unseen sleeper fill -PRON- with strange dread as though -PRON- could harm -PRON- and -PRON- pray that the day may come quickly 
-PRON- prayer address neither to god nor saint begin with a shiver as the chilly morning breeze creep through the chink of the carriage door to -PRON- foot and end in a trail of foolish word which -PRON- make to fit the insistent rhythm of the train and silently at interval of four second the telegraphpole hold the gallop note of the music between punctual bar 
this furious music allay -PRON- dread and lean against the windowledge -PRON- let -PRON- eyelid close again 
-PRON- drive in a jingle across cork while -PRON- be still early morning and stephen finish -PRON- sleep in a bedroom of the victoria hotel 
the bright warm sunlight be stream through the window and -PRON- could hear the din of traffic 
-PRON- father be stand before the dressingtable examine -PRON- hair and face and moustache with great care crane -PRON- neck across the waterjug and draw -PRON- back sideways to see the well 
while -PRON- do so -PRON- sing softly to -PRON- with quaint accent and phrase tis youth and folly make young man marry so here -PRON- love no longer stay 
what canot be cure sure must be injure sure so go to amerikay 
-PRON- love -PRON- s handsome -PRON- love -PRON- s bony like good whisky when -PRON- be new but when tis old and grow cold -PRON- fade and die like the mountain dew 
the consciousness of the warm sunny city outside -PRON- window and the tender tremor with which -PRON- father voice festoon the strange sad happy air drive off all the mist of the night ill humour from brain 
-PRON- get up quickly to dress and when the song have end say much pretty than any of -PRON- other comeallyous 
do -PRON- think so ask mr dedalus like -PRON- say stephen a pretty old air say mr dedalus twirl the point of -PRON- moustache 
ah but -PRON- should have hear mick lacy sing -PRON- 
poor mick lacy 
-PRON- have little turn for -PRON- grace note that -PRON- use to put in that i havenot get 
that be the boy who could sing a comeallyou if -PRON- like 
mr dedalus have order drisheen for breakfast and during the meal -PRON- crossexamine the waiter for local news 
for the most part -PRON- speak at cross purpose when a name be mention the waiter have in mind the present holder and mr dedalus -PRON- father or perhaps -PRON- grandfather 
well i hope -PRON- havenot move the college anyhow say mr dedalus for i want to show -PRON- to this youngster of mine 
along the mardyke the tree be in bloom 
-PRON- enter the ground of the college and be lead by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle 
but -PRON- progress across the gravel be bring to a halt after every dozen or so pace by some reply of the porter 
ah do -PRON- tell -PRON- so 
and be poor pottlebelly dead 
yes sir 
dead sir 
during these halt stephen stand awkwardly behind the two man weary of the subject and wait restlessly for the slow march to begin again 
by the time -PRON- have cross the quadrangle -PRON- restlessness have rise to fever 
-PRON- wonder how -PRON- father whom -PRON- know for a shrewd suspicious man could be dupe by the servile manner of the porter and the lively southern speech which have entertain -PRON- all the morning now irritate -PRON- ear 
-PRON- pass into the anatomy theatre where mr dedalu the porter aid -PRON- search the desk for -PRON- initial 
stephen remain in the background depress more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air -PRON- wear of jaded and formal study 
on the desk -PRON- read the word ftus cut several time in the dark stained wood 
the sudden legend startle -PRON- blood -PRON- seem to feel the absent student of the college about -PRON- and to shrink from -PRON- company 
a vision of -PRON- life which -PRON- father word have be powerless to evoke spring up before -PRON- out of the word cut in the desk 
a broadshouldere student with a moustache be cut in the letter with a jackknife seriously 
other student stand or sit near -PRON- laugh at -PRON- handiwork 
one jog -PRON- elbow 
the big student turn on -PRON- frowning 
-PRON- be dress in loose grey clothe and have tan boot name be call 
-PRON- hurry down the step of the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as -PRON- could be and peer closely at -PRON- father initial hide -PRON- flushed face 
but the word and the vision caper before -PRON- eye as -PRON- walk back across the quadrangle and towards the college gate 
-PRON- shock -PRON- to find in the outer world a trace of what -PRON- have deem till then a brutish and individual malady of -PRON- own mind 
-PRON- monstrous reverie come throng into -PRON- memory 
-PRON- too have spring up before -PRON- suddenly and furiously out of mere word 
-PRON- have soon give in to -PRON- and allow -PRON- to sweep across and abase -PRON- intellect wonder always where -PRON- come from from what den of monstrous image and always weak and humble towards other restless and sicken of -PRON- when -PRON- have sweep over -PRON- 
ay bedad 
and there s the grocery sure enough cry mr dedalus

the leave of the tree along the mardyke be astir and whisper in the sunlight 
a team of cricketer pass agile young man in flannel and blazer one of -PRON- carry the long green wicketbag 
in a quiet bystreet a german band of five player in fade uniform and with batter brass instrument be play to an audience of street arab and leisurely messenger boy 
a maid in a white cap and apron be water a box of plant on a sill which shine like a slab of limestone in the warm glare 
from another window open to the air come the sound of a piano scale after scale rise into the treble 
stephen walk on at -PRON- father side listen to story -PRON- have hear before hear again the name of the scatter and dead reveller who have be the companion of -PRON- father youth 
and a faint sickness sigh in -PRON- heart 
-PRON- recall -PRON- own equivocal position in belvedere a free boy a leader afraid of -PRON- own authority proud and sensitive and suspicious battle against the squalor of -PRON- life and against the riot of -PRON- mind 
the letter cut in the stained wood of the desk stare upon -PRON- mock -PRON- bodily weakness and futile enthusiasm and make -PRON- loathe -PRON- for -PRON- own mad and filthy orgy 
the spittle in -PRON- throat grow bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climb to -PRON- brain so that for a moment -PRON- close -PRON- eye and walk on in darkness 
-PRON- could still hear -PRON- father -PRON- kick out for -PRON- i daresay -PRON- will one of these daysremember whatever -PRON- do to mix with gentleman 
when i be a young fellow i tell -PRON- i enjoy -PRON-

the woman use to stand to look after -PRON- in the street 
-PRON- hear the sob pass loudly down -PRON- father throat and open -PRON- eye with a nervous impulse 
the sunlight break suddenly on -PRON- sight turn the sky and cloud into a fantastic world of sombre masse with lakelike space of dark rosy light 
-PRON- very brain be sick and powerless 
-PRON- could scarcely interpret the letter of the signboard of the shop 
by -PRON- monstrous way of life -PRON- seem to have put -PRON- beyond the limit of reality 
nothing move -PRON- or speak to -PRON- from the real world unless -PRON- hear in -PRON- an echo of the infuriate cry within -PRON- 
-PRON- could respond to no earthly or human appeal dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship weary and deject by -PRON- father voice 
-PRON- could scarcely recognise as -PRON- own thought and repeat slowly to -PRON- be stephen dedalus

on the evening of the day on which the property be sell stephen follow -PRON- father meekly about the city from bar to bar

an abyss of fortune or of temperament sunder -PRON- from -PRON- 
-PRON- mind seem old than -PRON- -PRON- shine coldly on -PRON- strife and happiness and regret like a moon upon a young earth 
no life or youth stir in -PRON- as -PRON- have stir in -PRON- 
-PRON- have know neither the pleasure of companionship with other nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial piety 
nothing stir within -PRON- soul but a cold and cruel and loveless lust 
-PRON- childhood be dead or lose and with -PRON- -PRON- soul capable of simple joy and -PRON- be drift amid life like the barren shell of the moon 
art thou pale for weariness of climb heaven and gaze on the earth wander companionless 
-PRON- repeat to -PRON- the line of fragment 
-PRON- alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycle of activity chill -PRON- and -PRON- forget -PRON- own human and ineffectual grieve mother and -PRON- brother and one of -PRON- cousin wait at the corner of quiet foster place while -PRON- and -PRON- father go up the step and along the colonnade where the highland sentry be parade 
when -PRON- have pass into the great hall and stand at the counter stephen draw forth -PRON- order on the governor of the bank of ireland for thirty and three pound and these sum the money of -PRON- exhibition and essay prize be pay over to -PRON- rapidly by the teller in note and in coin respectively 
-PRON- bestow -PRON- in -PRON- pocket with feigned composure and suffer the friendly teller to whom -PRON- father chat to take -PRON- hand across the broad counter and wish -PRON- a brilliant career in after life 
-PRON- be impatient of -PRON- voice and could not keep -PRON- foot at rest 
but the teller still defer the serving of other to say -PRON- be live in change time and that there be nothing like give a boy the good education that money could buy 
mr dedalus linger in the hall gaze about -PRON- and up at the roof and telling stephen who urge -PRON- to come out that -PRON- be stand in the house of common of the old irish parliament 
god help -PRON- -PRON- say piously to think of the man of those time stephen hely hutchinson and flood and henry grattan and charle kendal bushe and the nobleman -PRON- have now leader of the irish people at home and abroad 
why by god -PRON- wouldnot be see dead in a tenacre field with -PRON- 
no stephen old chap sorry to say that -PRON- be only as i rove out one fine may morning in the merry month of sweet july 
a keen october wind be blow round the bank 
the three figure stand at the edge of the muddy path have pinch cheek and watery eye 
stephen look at -PRON- thinly clothe mother and remember that a few day before -PRON- have see a mantle price at twenty guinea in the window of well that s do say mr dedalus

-PRON- doesnot matter about the dearness 
-PRON- walk on before -PRON- with short nervous step smile 
-PRON- try to keep up with -PRON- smile also at -PRON- eagerness 
take -PRON- easy like a good young fellow say -PRON- father not out for the half mile be -PRON- 
for a swift season of merrymake the money of -PRON- prize run through finger 
great parcel of grocery and delicacy and dry fruit arrive from the city 
every day -PRON- draw up a bill of fare for the family and every night lead a party of three or four to the theatre to see ingomar or the lady of lyon 
in -PRON- coat pocket -PRON- carry square of vienna chocolate for -PRON- guest while -PRON- trouser pocket bulge with masse of silver and copper coin 
-PRON- buy present for everyone overhaul -PRON- room write out resolution marshal -PRON- book up and down -PRON- shelf pore upon all kind of price list draw up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of -PRON- hold some office open a loan bank for -PRON- family and press loan on willing borrower so that -PRON- may have the pleasure of make out receipt and reckon the interest on the sum lend 
when -PRON- could do no more -PRON- drive up and down the city in trams 
then the season of pleasure come to an end 
the pot of pink enamel paint give out and the wainscot of -PRON- bedroom remain with -PRON- unfinished and illplastere coat 
-PRON- household return to -PRON- usual way of life 
-PRON- mother have no further occasion to upbraid -PRON- for squander -PRON- money 
-PRON- too return to -PRON- old life at school and all -PRON- novel enterprise fall to piece 
the commonwealth fall the loan bank close -PRON- coffer and -PRON- book on a sensible loss the rule of life which -PRON- have draw about -PRON- fall into desuetude 
how foolish -PRON- aim have be 
-PRON- have try to build a breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without -PRON- and to dam up by rule of conduct and active interest and new filial relation the powerful recurrence of the tide within -PRON- 
useless 
from without as from within the water have flow over -PRON- barrier -PRON- tide begin once more to jostle fiercely above the crumble mole 
-PRON- see clearly too -PRON- own futile isolation 
-PRON- have not go one step nearer the life -PRON- have seek to approach nor bridge the restless shame and rancour that have divide -PRON- from mother and brother and sister 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- be hardly of the one blood with -PRON- but stand to -PRON- rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage fosterchild and fosterbrother 
-PRON- turn to appease the fierce longing of -PRON- heart before which everything else be idle and alien 
-PRON- care little that -PRON- be in mortal sin that -PRON- life have grow to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood 
beside the savage desire within -PRON- to realise the enormity which -PRON- brood on nothing be sacred 
-PRON- bear cynically with the shameful detail of -PRON- secret riot in which -PRON- exult to defile with patience whatever image have attract -PRON- eye 
by day and by night -PRON- move among distorted image of the outer world 
a figure that have seem to -PRON- by day demure and innocent come towards -PRON- by night through the wind darkness of sleep -PRON- face transfigure by a lecherous cunne -PRON- eye bright with brutish joy 
only the morning pain -PRON- with -PRON- dim memory of dark orgiastic riot -PRON- keen and humiliating sense of transgression 
-PRON- return to -PRON- wandering 
the veiled autumnal evening lead -PRON- from street to street as -PRON- have lead -PRON- year before along the quiet avenue of blackrock 
but no vision of trim front garden or of kindly light in the window pour a tender influence upon -PRON- now 
only at time in the pause of -PRON- desire when the luxury that be waste -PRON- give room to a soft languor the image of mercede traverse the background of -PRON- memory 
-PRON- see again the small white house and the garden of rosebush on the road that lead to the mountain and -PRON- remember the sadly proud gesture of refusal which -PRON- be to make there stand with -PRON- in the moonlit garden after year of estrangement and adventure 
at those moment the soft speech of claude melnotte rise to -PRON- lip and ease -PRON- unrest 
a tender premonition touch -PRON- of the tryst -PRON- have then look forward to and in spite of the horrible reality which lie between -PRON- hope of then and now of the holy encounter -PRON- have then imagine at which weakness and timidity and inexperience be to fall from -PRON- 
such moment pass and the waste fire of lust spring up again 
the verse pass from -PRON- lip and the inarticulate cry and the unspoken brutal word rush forth from -PRON- brain to force a passage 
-PRON- blood be in revolt

-PRON- break from -PRON- like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferer and die in a wail of furious entreaty a cry for an iniquitous abandonment a cry which be but the echo of an obscene scrawl which -PRON- have read on the ooze wall of a urinal 
-PRON- have wander into a maze of narrow and dirty street 
from the foul laneway -PRON- hear burst of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of drunken singer

the whore would be just come out of -PRON- house make ready for the night yawn lazily after -PRON- sleep and settle the hairpin in -PRON- cluster of hair 
-PRON- would pass by -PRON- calmly wait for a sudden movement of -PRON- own will or a sudden call to -PRON- sinlove soul from -PRON- soft perfumed flesh 
yet as -PRON- prowl in quest of that call -PRON- sense stultify only by -PRON- desire would note keenly all that wound or shame -PRON- -PRON- eye a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldier stand to attention or a gaudy playbill -PRON- ear the drawl jargon of greet hello bertie any good in -PRON- mind

stephen sit in the front bench of the chapel 
father arnall sit at a table to the left of the altar 
-PRON- wear about -PRON- shoulder a heavy cloak -PRON- pale face be draw and -PRON- voice break with rheum 
the figure of -PRON- old master so strangely rearisen bring back to mind -PRON- life at clongowes the wide playground swarm with boy the square ditch the little cemetery off the main avenue of lime where -PRON- have dream of be bury the firelight on the wall of the infirmary where -PRON- lie sick the sorrowful face of brother michael 
-PRON- soul as these memory come back to -PRON- become again a child soul 
-PRON- be assemble here today -PRON- dear little brother in christ for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the great of saint the apostle of the indie the patron saint also of -PRON- college saint francis xavier 
year after year for much long than any of -PRON- -PRON- dear little boy can remember or than i can remember the boy of this college have meet in this very chapel to make -PRON- annual retreat before the feast day of -PRON- patron saint 
time have go on and bring with -PRON- -PRON- change 
even in the last few year what change can most of -PRON- not remember 
many of the boy who sit in those front bench a few year ago be perhaps now in distant land in the burn tropic or immerse in professional duty or in seminary or voyage over the vast expanse of the deep or -PRON- may be already call by the great god to another life and to the render up of -PRON- stewardship 
and still as the year roll by bring with -PRON- change for good and bad the memory of the great saint be honour by the boy of this college who make every year -PRON- annual retreat on the day precede the feast day set apart by -PRON- holy mother the church to transmit to all the age the name and fame of one of the great son of catholic spain 
now what be the meaning of this word retreat and why be -PRON- allow on all hand to be a most salutary practice for all who desire to lead before god and in the eye of man a truly christian life 
a retreat -PRON- dear boy signify a withdrawal for a while from the care of -PRON- life the care of this workaday world in order to examine the state of -PRON- conscience to reflect on the mystery of holy religion and to understand better why -PRON- be here in this world 
during these few day i intend to put before -PRON- some thought concern the four last thing 
-PRON- be as -PRON- know from -PRON- catechism death judgement hell and heaven 
-PRON- shall try to understand -PRON- fully during these few day so that -PRON- may derive from the understanding of -PRON- a lasting benefit to -PRON- soul 
and remember -PRON- dear boy that -PRON- have be send into this world for one thing and for one thing alone to do holy will and to save -PRON- immortal soul 
all else be worthless 
one thing alone be needful the salvation of one soul 
what doth -PRON- profit a man to gain the whole world if -PRON- suffer the loss of -PRON- immortal soul 
ah -PRON- dear boy believe -PRON- there be nothing in this wretched world that can make up for such a loss will ask -PRON- therefore -PRON- dear boy to put away from -PRON- mind during these few day all worldly thought whether of study or pleasure or ambition and to give all -PRON- attention to the state of -PRON- soul 
i need hardly remind -PRON- that during the day of the retreat all boy be expect to preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud unseemly pleasure 
the eld boy of course will see that this custom be not infringe and i look especially to the prefect and officer of the sodality of -PRON- bless lady and of the sodality of the holy angel to set a good example to -PRON- fellowstudent 
let -PRON- try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint francis with -PRON- whole heart and -PRON- whole mind blessing will then be upon all -PRON- year study 
but above and beyond all let this retreat be one to which -PRON- can look back in after year when maybe -PRON- be far from this college and among very different surrounding to which -PRON- can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thank to god for have grant -PRON- this occasion of lay the first foundation of a pious honourable zealous christian life 
and if as may so happen there be at this moment in these bench any poor soul who have have the unutterable misfortune to lose holy grace and to fall into grievous sin i fervently trust and pray that this retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul 
i pray to god through the merit of -PRON- zealous servant francis xavier that such a soul may be lead to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on saint day of this year may be a last covenant between god and that soul 
for just and unjust for saint and sinner alike may this retreat be a memorable one 
help -PRON- -PRON- dear little brother in christ

-PRON- will live a good life and die a good death believe and know that if -PRON- have sacrifice much in this earthly life -PRON- will be give to -PRON- a hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come in the kingdom without enda bless -PRON- dear boy which i wish -PRON- from -PRON- heart one and all in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 
amen 
as -PRON- walk home with silent companion a thick fog seem to compass -PRON- mind 
-PRON- wait in stupor of mind till -PRON- should lift and reveal what -PRON- have hide 
-PRON- eat -PRON- dinner with surly appetite and when the meal be over and the greasestrewn plate lie abandon on the table -PRON- rise and go to the window clear the thick scum from -PRON- mouth with -PRON- tongue and lick -PRON- from -PRON- lip 
so -PRON- have sink to the state of a beast that lick -PRON- chap after meat 
this be the end and a faint glimmer of fear begin to pierce the fog of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- press -PRON- face against the pane of the window and gaze out into the darken street 
form pass this way and that through the dull light 
and that be life 
the letter of the name of dublin lie heavily upon -PRON- mind push one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence 
-PRON- soul be fatten and congeal into a gross grease plunge ever deeper in -PRON- dull fear into a sombre threaten dusk while the body that be -PRON- stand listless and dishonour gaze out of darken eye helpless perturbed and human for a bovine god to stare upon 
the next day bring death and judgement stir -PRON- soul slowly from -PRON- listless despair 
the faint glimmer of fear become a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blow death into -PRON- soul 
-PRON- suffer -PRON- agony 
-PRON- feel the deathchill touch the extremity and creep onward towards the heart the film of death veil the eye the bright centre of the brain extinguish one by one like lamp the last sweat ooze upon the skin the powerlessness of the die limb the speech thickening and wander and fail the heart throb faintly and more faintly all but vanquish the breath the poor breath the poor helpless human spirit sob and sigh gurgle and rattle in the throat 
no help 
no help himselfhis body to which -PRON- have yield be die 
into the grave with -PRON- 
nail -PRON- down into a wooden box the corpse 
carry -PRON- out of the house on the shoulder of hireling 
thrust -PRON- out of men sight into a long hole in the ground into the grave to rot to feed the mass of -PRON- creeping worm and to be devour by scuttle plumpbellie rat 
and while the friend be still stand in tear by the bedside the soul of the sinner be judge 
at the last moment of consciousness the whole earthly life pass before the vision of the soul and ere -PRON- have time to reflect the body have die and the soul stand terrify before the judgement seat 
god who have long be merciful would then be just 
-PRON- have long be patient plead with the sinful soul give -PRON- time to repent sparing -PRON- yet awhile 
but that time have go 
time be to sin and to enjoy time be to scoff at god and at the warning of -PRON- holy church time be to defy -PRON- majesty to disobey -PRON- command to hoodwink one fellow man to commit sin after sin and to hide one corruption from the sight of man 
but that time be over 
now -PRON- be turn and -PRON- be not to be hoodwink or deceive 
every sin would then come forth from -PRON- lurkingplace the most rebellious against the divine will and the most degrading to -PRON- poor corrupt nature the tiny imperfection and the most heinous atrocity 
what do -PRON- avail then to have be a great emperor a great general a marvellous inventor the most learn of the learn 
all be as one before the judgement seat of god 
-PRON- would reward the good and punish the wicked 
one single instant be enough for the trial of a man soul 
one single instant after the bodys death the soul have be weigh in the balance 
the particular judgement be over and the soul have pass to the abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or have be hurl howl into hell 
nor be that all justice have still to be vindicate before man after the particular there still remain the general judgement 
the last day have come 
doomsday be at hand 
the star of heaven be fall upon the earth like the fig cast by the figtree which the wind have shake 
the sun the great luminary of the universe have become as sackcloth of hair 
the moon be bloodre 
the firmament be as a scroll roll away 
the archangel michael the prince of the heavenly host appear glorious and terrible against the sky 
with one foot on the sea and one foot on the land -PRON- blow from the archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time 
the three blast of the angel fill all the universe 
time be time be but time shall be no more 
at the last blast the soul of universal humanity throng towards the valley of jehosaphat rich and poor gentle and simple wise and foolish good and wicked 
the soul of every human being that have ever exist the soul of all those who shall yet be bear all the son and daughter of adam all be assemble on that supreme day 
and lo the supreme judge be come 
no longer the lowly lamb of god no longer the meek jesus of nazareth no longer the man of sorrow no longer the good shepherd -PRON- be see now come upon the cloud in great power and majesty attend by nine choir of angel angel and archangel principality power and virtue throne and domination cherubim and seraphim god omnipotent god everlaste 
-PRON- speak and -PRON- voice be hear even at the farth limit of space even in the bottomless abyss 
supreme judge from -PRON- sentence there will be and can be no appeal 
-PRON- call the just to -PRON- side bid -PRON- enter into the kingdom the eternity of bliss prepare for -PRON- 
the unjust -PRON- cast from -PRON- cry in -PRON- offended majesty depart from -PRON- ye curse into everlasting fire which be prepare for the devil and -PRON- angel what agony then for the miserable sinner 
friend be tear apart from friend child be tear from -PRON- parent husband from -PRON- wife 
the poor sinner hold out -PRON- arm to those who be dear to -PRON- in this earthly world to those whose simple piety perhaps -PRON- make a mock of to those who counsel -PRON- and try to lead -PRON- on the right path to a kind brother to a love sister to the mother and father who love -PRON- so dearly 
but -PRON- be too late the just turn away from the wretched damn soul which now appear before the eye of all in -PRON- hideous and evil character -PRON- hypocrite -PRON- white sepulchre -PRON- who present a smooth smile face to the world while -PRON- soul within be a foul swamp of sin how will -PRON- fare with -PRON- in that terrible day 
and this day will come shall come must come the day of death and the day of judgement 
-PRON- be appoint unto man to die and after death the judgement 
death be certain 
the time and manner be uncertain whether from long disease or from some unexpected accident the son of god cometh at an hour when -PRON- little expect -PRON- 
be therefore ready every moment see that -PRON- may die at any moment 
death be the end of -PRON- all 
death and judgement bring into the world by the sin of -PRON- first parent be the dark portal that close -PRON- earthly existence the portal that open into the unknown and the unseen portal through which every soul must pass alone unaided save by -PRON- good work without friend or brother or parent or master to help -PRON- alone and trembling 
let that thought be ever before -PRON- mind and then -PRON- can not sin

the wind of the last day blow through -PRON- mind -PRON- sin the jeweleye harlot of -PRON- imagination flee before the hurricane squeak like mouse in -PRON- terror and huddle under a mane of hair 
as -PRON- cross the square walk homeward the light laughter of a girl reach -PRON- burn ear 
the frail gay sound smote -PRON- heart more strongly than a trumpetblast and not dare to lift -PRON- eye -PRON- turn aside and gaze as -PRON- walk into the shadow of the tangled shrub

the chapel be flood by the dull scarlet light that filter through the lower blind and through the fissure between the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light enter like a spear and touch the embossed brass of the candlestick upon the altar that gleam like the battleworn mail armour of angel 
rain be fall on the chapel on the garden on the college 
-PRON- would rain for ever noiselessly 
the water would rise inch by inch cover the grass and shrub cover the tree and house cover the monument and the mountain top 
all life would be choke off noiselessly bird man elephant pig child noiselessly float corpse amid the litter of the wreckage of the world 
forty day and forty night the rain would fall till the water cover the face of the earth 
-PRON- may be 
why not 
hell have enlarge -PRON- soul and open -PRON- mouth without any limitsword take -PRON- dear little brother in christ jesus from the book of isaia fifth chapter fourteenth verse 
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 
amen 
the preacher take a chainless watch from a pocket within -PRON- soutane and have consider -PRON- dial for a moment in silence place -PRON- silently before -PRON- on the table 
-PRON- begin to speak in a quiet tone 
adam and eve -PRON- dear boy be as -PRON- know -PRON- first parent and -PRON- will remember that -PRON- be create by god in order that the seat in heaven leave vacant by the fall of lucifer and -PRON- rebellious angel may be fill again 
lucifer -PRON- be tell be a son of the morning a radiant and mighty angel yet -PRON- fall -PRON- fall and there fall with -PRON- a third part of the host of heaven -PRON- fall and be hurl with -PRON- rebellious angel into hell 
what -PRON- sin be -PRON- can not say 
theologian consider that -PRON- be the sin of pride the sinful thought conceive in an instant non serviam i will not serve that instant be -PRON- ruin 
-PRON- offend the majesty of god by the sinful thought of one instant and god cast -PRON- out of heaven into hell for ever 
adam and eve be then create by god and place in eden in the plain of damascus that lovely garden resplendent with sunlight and colour teem with luxuriant vegetation 
the fruitful earth give -PRON- -PRON- bounty beast and bird be -PRON- willing servant -PRON- know not the ill -PRON- flesh be heir to disease and poverty and death all that a great and generous god could do for -PRON- be do 
but there be one condition impose on -PRON- by god obedience to -PRON- word 
-PRON- be not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree 
alas -PRON- dear little boy -PRON- too fall 
the devil once a shine angel a son of the morning now a foul fiend come in the shape of a serpent the subtle of all the beast of the field 
-PRON- envy -PRON- 
-PRON- the fall great one could not bear to think that man a being of clay should possess the inheritance which -PRON- by -PRON- sin have forfeit for ever 
-PRON- come to the woman the weak vessel and pour the poison of -PRON- eloquence into -PRON- ear promise the blasphemy of that if -PRON- and adam eat of the forbid fruit -PRON- would become as god nay as god -PRON- 
eve yield to the wile of the arch tempter 
-PRON- eat the apple and give -PRON- also to adam who have not the moral courage to resist -PRON- 
the poison tongue of satan have do -PRON- work 
-PRON- fall 
and then the voice of god be hear in that garden call -PRON- creature man to account and michael prince of the heavenly host with a sword of flame in -PRON- hand appear before the guilty pair and drive -PRON- forth from eden into the world the world of sickness and striving of cruelty and disappointment of labour and hardship to earn -PRON- bread in the sweat of -PRON- brow 
but even then how merciful be god 
-PRON- take pity on -PRON- poor degraded parent and promise that in the fullness of time -PRON- would send down from heaven one who would redeem -PRON- make -PRON- once more child of god and heir to the kingdom of heaven and that one that redeemer of fallen man be to be only beget son the second person of the most blessed trinity the eternal word 
-PRON- come 
-PRON- be bear of a virgin pure mary the virgin mother 
-PRON- be bear in a poor cowhouse in judea and live as a humble carpenter for thirty year until the hour of -PRON- mission have come 
and then fill with love for man -PRON- go forth and call to man to hear the new gospel 
do -PRON- listen 
yes -PRON- listen but would not hear 
-PRON- be seize and bind like a common criminal mock at as a fool set aside to give place to a public robber scourge with five thousand lash crown with a crown of thorn hustle through the street by the jewish rabble and the roman soldiery strip of -PRON- garment and hang upon a gibbet and -PRON- side be pierce with a lance and from the wounded body of -PRON- lord water and blood issue continually 
yet even then in that hour of supreme agony -PRON- merciful redeemer have pity for mankind 
yet even there on the hill of calvary -PRON- found the holy catholic church against which -PRON- be promise the gate of hell shall not prevail 
-PRON- found -PRON- upon the rock of age and endow -PRON- with -PRON- grace with sacrament and sacrifice and promise that if man would obey the word of -PRON- church -PRON- would still enter into eternal life but if after all that have be do for -PRON- -PRON- still persist in -PRON- wickedness there remain for -PRON- an eternity of torment hell 
the preacher voice sink 
-PRON- pause join -PRON- palm for an instant part -PRON- 
then -PRON- resume now let -PRON- try for a moment to realise as far as -PRON- can the nature of that abode of the damn which the justice of an offended god have call into existence for the eternal punishment of sinner 
hell be a strait and dark and foulsmelle prison an abode of demon and lose soul fill with fire and smoke 
the straitness of this prison house be expressly design by god to punish those who refuse to be bind by -PRON- law 
in earthly prison the poor captive have at least some liberty of movement be -PRON- only within the four wall of -PRON- cell or in the gloomy yard of -PRON- prison 
not so in hell 
there by reason of the great number of the damn the prisoner be heap together in -PRON- awful prison the wall of which be say to be four thousand mile thick and the damn be so utterly bind and helpless that as a blessed saint saint anselm write in -PRON- book on similitude -PRON- be not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaw -PRON- 
-PRON- lie in exterior darkness 
for remember the fire of hell give forth no light 
as at the command of god the fire of the babylonian furnace lose -PRON- heat but not -PRON- light so at the command of god the fire of hell while retain the intensity of -PRON- heat burn eternally in darkness 
-PRON- be a neverending storm of darkness dark flame and dark smoke of burn brimstone amid which the body be heap one upon another without even a glimpse of air 
of all the plague with which the land of the pharaohs be smite one plague alone that of darkness be call horrible 
what name then shall -PRON- give to the darkness of hell which be to last not for three day alone but for all eternity 
the horror of this strait and dark prison be increase by -PRON- awful stench 
all the filth of the world all the offal and scum of the world -PRON- be tell shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day have purge the world 
the brimstone too which burn there in such prodigious quantity fill all hell with -PRON- intolerable stench and the body of the damn -PRON- exhale such a pestilential odour that as saint bonaventure say one of -PRON- alone would suffice to infect the whole world 
the very air of this world that pure element become foul and unbreathable when -PRON- have be long enclose 
consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell 
imagine some foul and putrid corpse that have lie rot and decomposing in the grave a jellylike mass of liquid corruption 
imagine such a corpse a prey to flame devour by the fire of burn brimstone and give off dense choke fume of nauseous loathsome decomposition 
and then imagine this sicken stench multiply a millionfold and a millionfold again from the million upon million of fetid carcass mass together in the reek darkness a huge and rot human fungus 
imagine all this and -PRON- will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell 
but this stench be not horrible though -PRON- be the great physical torment to which the damn be subject 
the torment of fire be the great torment to which the tyrant have ever subject -PRON- fellow creature 
place -PRON- finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and -PRON- will feel the pain of fire 
but -PRON- earthly fire be create by god for the benefit of man to maintain in -PRON- the spark of life and to help -PRON- in the useful art whereas the fire of hell be of another quality and be create by god to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner 
-PRON- earthly fire also consume more or less rapidly accord as the object which -PRON- attack be more or less combustible so that human ingenuity have even succeed in invent chemical preparation to check or frustrate -PRON- action 
but the sulphurous brimstone which burn in hell be a substance which be specially design to burn for ever and for ever with unspeakable fury 
moreover -PRON- earthly fire destroy at the same time as -PRON- burn so that the more intense -PRON- be the short be -PRON- duration but the fire of hell have this property that -PRON- preserve that which -PRON- burn and though -PRON- rage with incredible intensity -PRON- rage for ever 
-PRON- earthly fire again no matter how fierce or widespread -PRON- may be be always of a limited extent but the lake of fire in hell be boundless shoreless and bottomless 
-PRON- be on record that the devil -PRON- when ask the question by a certain soldier be oblige to confess that if a whole mountain be throw into the burn ocean of hell -PRON- would be burn up in an instant like a piece of wax 
and this terrible fire will not afflict the body of the damn only from without but each lose soul will be a hell unto -PRON- the boundless fire rage in -PRON- very vital how terrible be the lot of those wretched being 
the blood seethe and boil in the vein the brain be boil in the skull the heart in the breast glowing and burst the bowel a redhot mass of burn pulp the tender eye flame like molten ball 
and yet what i have say as to the strength and quality and boundlessness of this fire be as nothing when compare to -PRON- intensity an intensity which -PRON- have as be the instrument choose by divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike 
-PRON- be a fire which proceed directly from the ire of god work not of -PRON- own activity but as an instrument of divine vengeance 
as the water of baptism cleanse the soul with the body so do the fire of punishment torture the spirit with the flesh 
every sense of the flesh be torture and every faculty of the soul therewith the eye with impenetrable utter darkness the nose with noisome odour the ear with yell and howl and execration the taste with foul matter leprous corruption nameless suffocate filth the touch with redhot goad and spike with cruel tongue of flame 
and through the several torment of the sense the immortal soul be torture eternally in -PRON- very essence amid the league upon league of glow fire kindle in the abyss by the offended majesty of the omnipotent god and fan into everlasting and everincrease fury by the breath of the anger of the godhead 
consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison be increase by the company of the damn -PRON- 
evil company on earth be so noxious that the plant as if by instinct withdraw from the company of whatsoever be deadly or hurtful to -PRON- 
in hell all law be overturnedthere be no thought of family or country of tie of relationship 
the damned howl and scream at one another -PRON- torture and rage intensify by the presence of being torture and rage like -PRON- 
all sense of humanity be forget 
the yell of the suffering sinner fill the remote corner of the vast abyss 
the mouth of the damn be full of blasphemy against god and of hatred for -PRON- fellow sufferer and of curse against those soul which be -PRON- accomplice in sin 
in olden time -PRON- be the custom to punish the parricide the man who have raise -PRON- murderous hand against -PRON- father by cast -PRON- into the depth of the sea in a sack in which be place a cock a monkey and a serpent 
the intention of those lawgiver who frame such a law which seem cruel in -PRON- time be to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beast 
but what be the fury of those dumb beast compare with the fury of execration which burst from the parched lip and ache throat of the damn in hell when -PRON- behold in -PRON- companion in misery those who aid and abet -PRON- in sin those whose word sow the first seed of evil thinking and evil live in -PRON- mind those whose immodest suggestion lead -PRON- on to sin those whose eye tempt and allure -PRON- from the path of virtue 
-PRON- turn upon those accomplice and upbraid -PRON- and curse -PRON- 
but -PRON- be helpless and hopeless -PRON- be too late now for repentance 
last of all consider the frightful torment to those damn soul tempter and tempt alike of the company of the devil 
these devil will afflict the damn in two way by -PRON- presence and by -PRON- reproach 
-PRON- can have no idea of how horrible these devil be 
saint catherine of siena once see a devil and -PRON- have write that rather than look again for one single instant on such a frightful monster -PRON- would prefer to walk until the end of -PRON- life along a track of red coal 
these devil who be once beautiful angel have become as hideous and ugly as -PRON- once be beautiful 
-PRON- mock and jeer at the lose soul whom -PRON- drag down to ruin 
-PRON- be -PRON- the foul demon who be make in hell the voice of conscience 
why do -PRON- sin 
why do -PRON- lend an ear to the tempting of friend 
why do -PRON- turn aside from -PRON- pious practice and good work 
why do -PRON- not shun the occasion of sin 
why do -PRON- not leave that evil companion 
why do -PRON- not give up that lewd habit that impure habit 
why do -PRON- not listen to the counsel of -PRON- confessor 
why do -PRON- not even after -PRON- have fall the first or the second or the third or the fourth or the hundredth time repent of -PRON- evil way and turn to god who only wait for -PRON- repentance to absolve -PRON- of -PRON- sin 
now the time for repentance have go by 
time be time be but time shall be no more 
time be to sin in secrecy to indulge in that sloth and pride to covet the unlawful to yield to the prompting of -PRON- low nature to live like the beast of the field nay bad than the beast of the field for -PRON- at least be but brute and have no reason to guide -PRON- time be but time shall be no more 
god speak to -PRON- by so many voice but -PRON- would not hear 
-PRON- would not crush out that pride and anger in -PRON- heart -PRON- would not restore those illgotten good -PRON- would not obey the precept of -PRON- holy church nor attend to -PRON- religious duty -PRON- would not abandon those wicked companion -PRON- would not avoid those dangerous temptation 
such be the language of those fiendish tormentor word of taunt and of reproach of hatred and of disgust 
of disgust yes 
for even -PRON- the very devil when -PRON- sin sin by such a sin as alone be compatible with such angelical nature a rebellion of the intellect and -PRON- even -PRON- the foul devil must turn away revolt and disgust from the contemplation of those unspeakable sin by which degrade man outrage and defile the temple of the holy ghost defile and pollute -PRON- -PRON- dear little brother in christ may -PRON- never be -PRON- lot to hear that language 
may -PRON- never be -PRON- lot i say 
in the last day of terrible reckon i pray fervently to god that not a single soul of those who be in this chapel today may be find among those miserable being whom the great judge shall command to depart for ever from -PRON- sight that not one of -PRON- may ever hear ring in -PRON- ear the awful sentence of rejection depart from -PRON- ye curse into everlasting fire which be prepare for the devil and -PRON- angel -PRON- come down the aisle of the chapel -PRON- leg shake and the scalp of -PRON- head trembling as though -PRON- have be touch by ghostly finger 
-PRON- pass up the staircase and into the corridor along the wall of which the overcoat and waterproof hang like gibbet malefactor headless and dripping and shapeless 
and at every step -PRON- fear that -PRON- have already die that -PRON- soul have be wrench forth of the sheath of -PRON- body that -PRON- be plunge headlong through space 
-PRON- could not grip the floor with -PRON- foot and sit heavily at -PRON- desk opening one of -PRON- book at random and pore over -PRON- 
every word for -PRON- 
-PRON- be true 
god be almighty 
god could call -PRON- now call -PRON- as -PRON- sit at -PRON- desk before -PRON- have time to be conscious of the summon 
god have call -PRON- 
yes 
what 
yes 
-PRON- flesh shrink together as -PRON- feel the approach of the ravenous tongue of flame dry up as -PRON- feel about -PRON- the swirl of stifle air 
-PRON- have die 
yes 
-PRON- be judge 
a wave of fire sweep through -PRON- body the first 
again a wave 
-PRON- brain begin to glow 
another 
-PRON- brain be simmer and bubble within the crack tenement of the skull 
flame burst forth from -PRON- skull like a corolla shriek like voice hell 
hell 
hell 
hell 
hell 
voice speak near -PRON- on hell suppose -PRON- rub -PRON- into -PRON- well 
-PRON- bet -PRON- do 
-PRON- put -PRON- all into a blue funk what -PRON- fellow want and plenty of -PRON- to make -PRON- work 
-PRON- lean back weakly in -PRON- desk 
-PRON- have not die 
god have spare -PRON- still 
-PRON- be still in the familiar world of the school 
mr tate and vincent heron stand at the window talk jesting gaze out at the bleak rain move -PRON- head wish -PRON- would clear up 
i have arrange to go for a spin on the bike with some fellow out by malahide 
but the road must be kneedeep 
-PRON- may clear up sir 
the voice that -PRON- know so well the common word the quiet of the classroom when the voice pause and the silence be fill by the sound of softly browse cattle as the other boy munch -PRON- lunch tranquilly lull -PRON- ache soul 
there be still time 
mary refuge of sinner intercede for -PRON- 
virgin undefile save -PRON- from the gulf of death 
the english lesson begin with the hearing of the history 
royal person favourite intriguer bishop pass like mute phantom behind -PRON- veil of name 
all have die all have be judge 
what do -PRON- profit a man to gain the whole world if -PRON- lose -PRON- soul 
at last -PRON- have understand and human life lie around -PRON- a plain of peace whereon antlike man labour in brotherhood -PRON- dead sleep under quiet mound 
the elbow of -PRON- companion touch -PRON- and -PRON- heart be touch and when -PRON- speak to answer a question of -PRON- master -PRON- hear -PRON- own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition 
-PRON- soul sink back deeper into depth of contrite peace no longer able to suffer the pain of dread and send forth as -PRON- sink a faint prayer 
ah yes -PRON- would still be spare -PRON- would repent in -PRON- heart and be forgive and then those above those in heaven would see what -PRON- would do to make up for the past a whole life every hour of life 
only wait 
all god 
all all 
a messenger come to the door to say that confession be be hear in the chapel 
four boy leave the room and -PRON- hear other pass down the corridor 
a tremulous chill blow round -PRON- heart no strong than a little wind and yet listen and suffer silently -PRON- seem to have lay an ear against the muscle of -PRON- own heart feel -PRON- close and quail listen to the flutter of -PRON- ventricle 
no escape 
-PRON- have to confess to speak out in word what -PRON- have do and think sin after sin 
how 
how 
father the thought slide like a cold shine rapier into -PRON- tender flesh confession 
but not there in the chapel of the college 
-PRON- would confess all every sin of deed and think sincerely but not there among -PRON- school companion 
far away from there in some dark place -PRON- would murmur out -PRON- own shame and -PRON- beseech god humbly not to be offend with -PRON- if -PRON- do not dare to confess in the college chapel and in utter abjection of spirit -PRON- crave forgiveness mutely of the boyish heart about -PRON- 
time pass 
-PRON- sit again in the front bench of the chapel 
the daylight without be already fail and as -PRON- fall slowly through the dull red blind -PRON- seem that the sun of the last day be go down and that all soul be be gather for the judgement be cast away from the sight of thine eye word take -PRON- dear little brother in christ from the book of psalm thirtieth chapter twentythird verse 
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 
amen 
the preacher begin to speak in a quiet friendly tone 
-PRON- face be kind and -PRON- join gently the finger of each hand form a frail cage by the union of -PRON- tip 
this morning -PRON- endeavour in -PRON- reflection upon hell to make what -PRON- holy founder call in -PRON- book of spiritual exercise the composition of place 
-PRON- endeavour that be to imagine with the sense of the mind in -PRON- imagination the material character of that awful place and of the physical torment which all who be in hell endure 
this evening -PRON- shall consider for a few moment the nature of the spiritual torment of hell 
sin remember be a twofold enormity 
-PRON- be a base consent to the prompting of -PRON- corrupt nature to the low instinct to that which be gross and beastlike and -PRON- be also a turning away from the counsel of -PRON- high nature from all that be pure and holy from the holy god -PRON- 
for this reason mortal sin be punish in hell by two different form of punishment physical and spiritual 
now of all these spiritual pain by far the great be the pain of loss so great in fact that in -PRON- -PRON- be a torment great than all the other 
saint thomas the great doctor of the church the angelic doctor as -PRON- be call say that the bad damnation consist in this that the understanding of man be totally deprive of divine light and -PRON- affection obstinately turn away from the goodness of god 
god remember be a be infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful 
in this life -PRON- have not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damn in hell for -PRON- great torment have a full understanding of that which -PRON- have lose and understand that -PRON- have lose -PRON- through -PRON- own sin and have lose -PRON- for ever 
at the very instant of death the bond of the flesh be break asunder and the soul at once fly towards god as towards the centre of -PRON- existence 
remember -PRON- dear little boy -PRON- soul long to be with god 
-PRON- come from god -PRON- live by god -PRON- belong to god -PRON- be -PRON- inalienably -PRON- 
god love with a divine love every human soul and every human soul live in that love 
how could -PRON- be otherwise 
every breath that -PRON- draw every thought of -PRON- brain every instant of life proceed from inexhaustible goodness 
and if -PRON- be pain for a mother to be part from -PRON- child for a man to be exile from hearth and home for friend to be sunder from friend think what pain what anguish -PRON- must be for the poor soul to be spurn from the presence of the supremely good and loving creator who have call that soul into existence from nothingness and sustain -PRON- in life and love -PRON- with an immeasurable love 
this then to be separate for ever from -PRON- great good from god and to feel the anguish of that separation know full well that -PRON- be unchangeable this be the great torment which the create soul be capable of bear pna damni the pain of loss 
the second pain which will afflict the soul of the damn in hell be the pain of conscience 
just as in dead body worm be engender by putrefaction so in the soul of the lose there arise a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin the sting of conscience the worm as pope innocent the third call -PRON- of the triple sting 
the first sting inflict by this cruel worm will be the memory of past pleasure what a dreadful memory will that be 
in the lake of alldevoure flame the proud king will remember the pomp of -PRON- court the wise but wicked man -PRON- library and instrument of research the lover of artistic pleasure -PRON- marble and picture and other art treasure -PRON- who delight in the pleasure of the table -PRON- gorgeous feast -PRON- dish prepare with such delicacy -PRON- choice wine the miser will remember -PRON- hoard of gold the robber -PRON- illgotten wealth the angry and revengeful and merciless murderer -PRON- deed of blood and violence in which -PRON- revel the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasure in which -PRON- delight 
-PRON- will remember all this and loathe -PRON- and -PRON- sin 
for how miserable will all those pleasure seem to the soul condemn to suffer in hellfire for age and age 
how -PRON- will rage and fume to think that -PRON- have lose the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth for a few piece of metal for vain honour for bodily comfort for a tingling of the nerve 
-PRON- will repent indeed and this be the second sting of the worm of conscience a late and fruitless sorrow for sin commit 
divine justice insist that the understanding of those miserable wretch be fix continually on the sin of which -PRON- be guilty and moreover as saint augustine point out god will impart to -PRON- -PRON- own knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to -PRON- in all -PRON- hideous malice as -PRON- appear to the eye of god -PRON- 
-PRON- will behold -PRON- sin in all -PRON- foulness and repent but -PRON- will be too late and then -PRON- will bewail the good occasion which -PRON- neglect 
this be the last and deep and most cruel sting of the worm of conscience 
the conscience will say -PRON- have time and opportunity to repent and would not 
-PRON- be bring up religiously by -PRON- parent 
-PRON- have the sacrament and grace and indulgence of the church to aid -PRON- 
-PRON- have the minister of god to preach to -PRON- to call -PRON- back when -PRON- have stray to forgive -PRON- -PRON- sin no matter how many how abominable if only -PRON- have confess and repent 
no 
-PRON- would not 
-PRON- flout the minister of holy religion -PRON- turn -PRON- back on the confessional -PRON- wallow deep and deep in the mire of sin 
god appeal to -PRON- threaten -PRON- entreat -PRON- to return to -PRON- what shame what misery 
the ruler of the universe entreat -PRON- a creature of clay to love -PRON- who make -PRON- and to keep -PRON- law 
no 
-PRON- would not 
and now though -PRON- be to flood all hell with -PRON- tear if -PRON- could still weep all that sea of repentance would not gain for -PRON- what a single tear of true repentance shed during -PRON- mortal life would have gain for -PRON- 
-PRON- implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to repent in vain 
that time be go go for ever 
such be the threefold sting of conscience the viper which gnaw the very heart core of the wretch in hell so that fill with hellish fury -PRON- curse -PRON- for -PRON- folly and curse the evil companion who have bring -PRON- to such ruin and curse the devil who tempt -PRON- in life and now mock -PRON- in eternity and even revile and curse the supreme be whose goodness and patience -PRON- scorn and slight but whose justice and power -PRON- can not evade 
the next spiritual pain to which the damn be subject be the pain of extension 
man in this earthly life though -PRON- be capable of many evil be not capable of -PRON- all at once inasmuch as one evil correct and counteract another just as one poison frequently correct another 
in hell on the contrary one torment instead of counteract another lend -PRON- still great force and moreover as the internal faculty be more perfect than the external sense so be -PRON- more capable of suffering 
just as every sense be afflict with a fitting torment so be every spiritual faculty the fancy with horrible image the sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage the mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even than the exterior darkness which reign in that dreadful prison 
the malice impotent though -PRON- be which possess these demon soul be an evil of boundless extension of limitless duration a frightful state of wickedness which -PRON- can scarcely realise unless -PRON- bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred god bear to -PRON- 
oppose to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with -PRON- -PRON- have the pain of intensity 
hell be the centre of evil and as -PRON- know thing be more intense at -PRON- centre than at -PRON- remote point 
there be no contrary or admixture of any kind to temper or soften in the least the pain of hell 
nay thing which be good in -PRON- become evil in hell 
company elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflict will be there a continual torment knowledge so much long for as the chief good of the intellect will there be hate bad than ignorance light so much covet by all creature from the lord of creation down to the humble plant in the forest will be loathe intensely 
in this life -PRON- sorrow be either not very long or not very great because nature either overcome -PRON- by habit or put an end to -PRON- by sink under -PRON- weight 
but in hell the torment can not be overcome by habit for while -PRON- be of terrible intensity -PRON- be at the same time of continual variety each pain so to speak take fire from another and reendowe that which have enkindle -PRON- with a still fiercer flame 
nor can nature escape from these intense and various torture by succumb to -PRON- for the soul be sustain and maintain in evil so that -PRON- suffering may be the great 
boundless extension of torment incredible intensity of suffer unceasing variety of torturethis be what the divine majesty so outrage by sinner demand this be what the holiness of heaven slight and set aside for the lustful and low pleasure of the corrupt flesh require this be what the blood of the innocent lamb of god shed for the redemption of sinner trample upon by the vile of the vile insist upon 
last and crowning torture of all the torture of that awful place be the eternity of hell 
eternity dread and dire word 
eternity 
what mind of man can understand -PRON- 
and remember -PRON- be an eternity of pain 
even though the pain of hell be not so terrible as -PRON- be yet -PRON- would become infinite as -PRON- be destine to last for ever 
but while -PRON- be everlaste -PRON- be at the same time as -PRON- know intolerably intense unbearably extensive 
to bear even the sting of an insect for all eternity would be a dreadful torment 
what must -PRON- be then to bear the manifold torture of hell for ever 
for ever 
for all eternity 
not for a year or for an age but for ever 
try to imagine the awful meaning of this 
-PRON- have often see the sand on the seashore 
how fine be -PRON- tiny grain 
and how many of those tiny little grain go to make up the small handful which a child grasps in -PRON- play 
now imagine a mountain of that sand a million mile high reach from the earth to the farth heaven and a million mile broad extend to remote space and a million mile in thickness and imagine such an enormous mass of countless particle of sand multiply as often as there be leave in the forest drop of water in the mighty ocean feather on bird scale on fish hair on animal atom in the vast expanse of the air and imagine that at the end of every million year a little bird come to that mountain and carry away in -PRON- beak a tiny grain of that sand 
how many million upon million of century would pass before that bird have carry away even a square foot of that mountain how many eon upon eon of age before -PRON- have carry away all 
yet at the end of that immense stretch of time not even one instant of eternity could be say to have end 
at the end of all those billion and trillion of year eternity would have scarcely begin 
and if that mountain rise again after -PRON- have be all carry away and if the bird come again and carry -PRON- all away again grain by grain and if -PRON- so rise and sink as many time as there be star in the sky atom in the air drop of water in the sea leave on the tree feather upon bird scale upon fish hair upon animal at the end of all those innumerable rising and sinking of that immeasurably vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be say to have end even then at the end of such a period after that eon of time the mere thought of which make -PRON- very brain reel dizzily eternity would scarcely have begin holy saint one of -PRON- own father i believe -PRON- be be once vouchsafe a vision of hell 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- stand in the midst of a great hall dark and silent save for the ticking of a great clock 
the ticking go on unceasingly and -PRON- seem to this saint that the sound of the ticking be the ceaseless repetition of the word ever never ever never 
ever to be in hell never to be in heaven ever to be shut off from the presence of god never to enjoy the beatific vision ever to be eat with flame gnaw by vermin goad with burn spike never to be free from those pain ever to have the conscience upbraid one the memory enrage the mind fill with darkness and despair never to escape ever to curse and revile the foul demon who gloat fiendishly over the misery of -PRON- dupe never to behold the shine raiment of the bless spirit ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to god for an instant a single instant of respite from such awful agony never to receive even for an instant pardon ever to suffer never to enjoy ever to be damn never to be save ever never ever never what a dreadful punishment 
an eternity of endless agony of endless bodily and spiritual torment without one ray of hope without one moment of cessation of agony limitless in intensity of torment infinitely varied of torture that sustain eternally that which -PRON- eternally devour of anguish that everlastingly prey upon the spirit while -PRON- rack the flesh an eternity every instant of which be -PRON- an eternity of woe 
such be the terrible punishment decree for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and a just god 
yes a just god 
man reason always as man be astonish that god should mete out an everlasting and infinite punishment in the fire of hell for a single grievous sin 
-PRON- reason thus because blind by the gross illusion of the flesh and the darkness of human understanding -PRON- be unable to comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin 
-PRON- reason thus because -PRON- be unable to comprehend that even venial sin be of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent creator could end all the evil and misery in the world the war the disease the robbery the crime the death the murder on condition that -PRON- allow a single venial sin to pass unpunished a single venial sin a lie an angry look a moment of wilful sloth -PRON- the great omnipotent god could not do so because sin be -PRON- in thought or deed be a transgression of -PRON- law and god would not be god if -PRON- do not punish the transgressor sin an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect make lucifer and a third part of the cohort of angel fall from -PRON- glory 
a sin an instant of folly and weakness drive adam and eve out of eden and bring death and suffer into the world 
to retrieve the consequence of that sin the only begotten son of god come down to earth live and suffer and die a most painful death hang for three hour on the cross -PRON- dear little brother in christ jesus will -PRON- then offend that good redeemer and provoke -PRON- anger 
will -PRON- trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse 
will -PRON- spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love 
will -PRON- too like the cruel jew and the brutal soldier mock that gentle and compassionate saviour who trod alone for -PRON- sake the awful winepress of sorrow 
every word of sin be a wound in -PRON- tender side 
every sinful act be a thorn pierce -PRON- head 
every impure think deliberately yield to be a keen lance transfixing that sacred and love heart 
no no 
-PRON- be impossible for any human be to do that which offend so deeply the divine majesty that which be punish by an eternity of agony that which crucifie again the son of god and make a mockery of -PRON- pray to god that -PRON- poor word may have avail today to confirm in holiness those who be in a state of grace to strengthen the wavering to lead back to the state of grace the poor soul that have stray if any such be among -PRON- 
i pray to god and do -PRON- pray with -PRON- that -PRON- may repent of -PRON- sin 
i will ask -PRON- now all of -PRON- to repeat after -PRON- the act of contrition kneel here in this humble chapel in the presence of god 
-PRON- be there in the tabernacle burn with love for mankind ready to comfort the afflicted 
be not afraid 
no matter how many or how foul the sin if -PRON- only repent of -PRON- -PRON- will be forgive -PRON- 
let no worldly shame hold -PRON- back 
god be still the merciful lord who wish not the eternal death of the sinner but rather that -PRON- be convert and live 
-PRON- call -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- 
-PRON- make -PRON- out of nothing 
-PRON- love -PRON- as only a god can love 
-PRON- arm be open to receive -PRON- even though -PRON- have sin against -PRON- 
come to -PRON- poor sinner poor vain and err sinner 
now be the acceptable time 
now be the hour 
the priest rise and turn towards the altar kneel upon the step before the tabernacle in the fall gloom 
-PRON- wait till all in the chapel have knelt and every least noise be still 
then raise -PRON- head -PRON- repeat the act of contrition phrase by phrase with fervour 
the boy answer -PRON- phrase by phrase 
stephen -PRON- tongue cleave to -PRON- palate bow -PRON- head pray with -PRON- heart my god -PRON- god be heartily sorry be heartily sorry for have offend thee for have offend thee and i detest -PRON- sin and i detest -PRON- sin above every other evil above every other evil because -PRON- displease thee -PRON- god because -PRON- displease thee -PRON- god who art so deserve who art so deserve of all -PRON- love of all -PRON- love and i firmly purpose and i firmly purpose by thy holy grace by thy holy grace never more to offend thee never more to offend thee and to amend -PRON- life and to amend -PRON- life -PRON- go up to -PRON- room after dinner in order to be alone with -PRON- soul and at every step -PRON- soul seem to sigh at every step -PRON- soul mount with -PRON- foot sigh in the ascent through a region of viscid gloom 
-PRON- halt on the landing before the door and then grasp the porcelain knob open the door quickly 
-PRON- wait in fear -PRON- soul pine within -PRON- pray silently that death may not touch -PRON- brow as -PRON- pass over the threshold that the fiend that inhabit darkness may not be give power over -PRON- 
-PRON- wait still at the threshold as at the entrance to some dark cave 
face be there eye -PRON- wait and watch 
-PRON- know perfectly well of course that though -PRON- be bind to come to the light -PRON- would find considerable difficulty in endeavour to try to induce -PRON- to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so -PRON- know of course perfectly face wait and watch murmurous voice fill the dark shell of the cave 
-PRON- fear intensely in spirit and in flesh but raise -PRON- head bravely -PRON- stride into the room firmly 
a doorway a room the same room same window 
-PRON- tell -PRON- calmly that those word have absolutely no sense which have seem to rise murmurously from the dark 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be simply -PRON- room with the door open 
-PRON- close the door and walk swiftly to the bed knelt beside -PRON- and cover -PRON- face with -PRON- hand 
-PRON- hand be cold and damp and -PRON- limb ache with chill 
bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset -PRON- route -PRON- thought 
why be -PRON- kneel there like a child say -PRON- evening prayer 
to be alone with -PRON- soul to examine -PRON- conscience to meet -PRON- sin face to face to recall -PRON- time and manner and circumstance to weep over -PRON- 
-PRON- could not weep 
-PRON- could not summon -PRON- to -PRON- memory 
-PRON- feel only an ache of soul and body -PRON- whole be memory will understand flesh benumbed and weary 
that be the work of devil to scatter -PRON- thought and overcloud -PRON- conscience assail -PRON- at the gate of the cowardly and sincorrupted flesh and pray god timidly to forgive -PRON- -PRON- weakness -PRON- crawl up on to the bed and wrap the blanket closely about -PRON- cover -PRON- face again with -PRON- hand 
-PRON- have sin 
-PRON- have sin so deeply against heaven and before god that -PRON- be not worthy to be call child 
could -PRON- be that -PRON- stephen dedalus have do those thing 
-PRON- conscience sigh in answer 
yes -PRON- have do -PRON- secretly filthily time after time and harden in sinful impenitence -PRON- have dare to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle -PRON- while -PRON- soul within be a live mass of corruption 
how come -PRON- that god have not strike -PRON- dead 
the leprous company of -PRON- sin close about -PRON- breathe upon -PRON- bend over -PRON- from all side 
-PRON- strive to forget -PRON- in an act of prayer huddle -PRON- limb closer together and bind down -PRON- eyelid but the sense of -PRON- soul would not be bind and though -PRON- eye be shut fast -PRON- see the place where -PRON- have sin and though -PRON- ear be tightly cover -PRON- hear 
-PRON- desire with all -PRON- will not to hear or see 
-PRON- desire till -PRON- frame shake under the strain of -PRON- desire and until the sense of -PRON- soul close 
-PRON- close for an instant and then open 
-PRON- see 
a field of stiff weed and thistle and tufte nettlebunche 
thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lie batter canister and clot and coil of solid excrement 
a faint marshlight struggle upwards from all the ordure through the bristle greygreen weed 
an evil smell faint and foul as the light curl upwards sluggishly out of the canister and from the stale crust dung 
creature be in the field one three six creature be move in the field hither and thither 
goatish creature with human face hornybrowe lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber 
the malice of evil glitter in -PRON- hard eye as -PRON- move hither and thither trail -PRON- long tail behind -PRON- 
a rictus of cruel malignity light up greyly -PRON- old bony face

-PRON- move in slow circle circle closer and closer to enclose to enclose soft language issue from -PRON- lip -PRON- long swishing tail besmear with stale shite thrust upwards -PRON- terrific face 
help 
-PRON- fling the blanket from -PRON- madly to free -PRON- face and neck

at the washstand a convulsion seize -PRON- within and clasp -PRON- cold forehead wildly -PRON- vomit profusely in agony 
when the fit have spend -PRON- -PRON- walk weakly to the window and lift the sash sit in a corner of the embrasure and lean -PRON- elbow upon the sill 
the rain have draw off and amid the move vapour from point to point of light the city be spin about -PRON- a soft cocoon of yellowish haze 
heaven be still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to breathe as in a thicket drench with shower and amid peace and shimmer light and quiet fragrance -PRON- make a covenant with -PRON- heart 
-PRON- pray -PRON- once have mean to come on earth in heavenly glory but -PRON- sin and then -PRON- could not safely visit -PRON- but with a shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for -PRON- be god 
so -PRON- come -PRON- in weakness not in power and -PRON- send thee a creature in -PRON- stead with a creature comeliness and lustre suited to -PRON- state 
and now thy very face and form dear mother speak to -PRON- of the eternal not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which be thy emblem bright and musical breathing purity telling of heaven and infuse peace harbringer of day light of the pilgrim 
lead -PRON- still as thou hast lead 
in the dark night across the bleak wilderness guide -PRON- on to -PRON- lord jesus guide -PRON- home -PRON- eye be dim with tear and look humbly up to heaven -PRON- weep for the innocence -PRON- have lose 
when evening have fall -PRON- leave the house and the first touch of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as -PRON- close behind -PRON- make ache again -PRON- conscience lull by prayer and tear 
confess 
confess 
-PRON- be not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a prayer 
-PRON- have to kneel before the minister of the holy ghost and tell over -PRON- hide sin truly and repentantly 
before -PRON- hear again the footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as -PRON- open to let -PRON- in before -PRON- see again the table in the kitchen set for supper -PRON- would have knelt and confess 
-PRON- be quite simple 
the ache of conscience cease and -PRON- walk onward swiftly through the dark street 
there be so many flagstone on the footpath of that street and so many street in that city and so many city in the world 
yet eternity have no end 
-PRON- be in mortal sin 
even once be a mortal sin 
-PRON- could happen in an instant 
but how so quickly 
by see or by think of see 
the eye see the thing without have wish first to see 
then in an instant -PRON- happen 
but do that part of the body understand or what 
the serpent the most subtle beast of the field 
-PRON- must understand when -PRON- desire in one instant and then prolong -PRON- own desire instant after instant sinfully 
-PRON- feel and understand and desire 
what a horrible thing 
who make -PRON- to be like that a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially 
be that then -PRON- or an inhuman thing move by a low soul 
-PRON- soul sicken at the thought of a torpid snaky life feed -PRON- out of the tender marrow of -PRON- life and fattening upon the slime of lust why be that so why 
-PRON- cower in the shadow of the thought abase -PRON- in the awe of god who have make all thing and all man 
madness 
who could think such a thought 
and cower in darkness and abject -PRON- pray mutely to -PRON- guardian angel to drive away with -PRON- sword the demon that be whisper to -PRON- brain 
the whisper cease and -PRON- know then clearly that -PRON- own soul have sin in thought and word and deed wilfully through -PRON- own body

-PRON- have to confess every sin 
how could -PRON- utter in word to the priest what -PRON- have do 
must must 
or how could -PRON- explain without die of shame 
or how could -PRON- have do such thing without shame 
a madman 
confess -PRON- would indeed to be free and sinless again 
perhaps the priest would know dear god 
-PRON- walk on and on through illlit street fear to stand still for a moment lest -PRON- may seem that -PRON- hold back from what await -PRON- fear to arrive at that towards which -PRON- still turn with longing 
how beautiful must be a soul in the state of grace when god look upon -PRON- with love 
frowsy girl sit along the curbstone before -PRON- basket 
-PRON- dank hair hang trail over -PRON- brow 
-PRON- be not beautiful to see as -PRON- crouch in the mire 
but -PRON- soul be see by god and if -PRON- soul be in a state of grace -PRON- be radiant to see and god love -PRON- see -PRON- 
a waste breath of humiliation blow bleakly over -PRON- soul to think of how -PRON- have fall to feel that those soul be dearer to god than -PRON- 
the wind blow over -PRON- and pass on to the myriad and myriad of other soul on whom favour shine now more and now less star now brighter and now dimmer sustained and fail 
and the glimmering soul pass away sustained and fail merge in a move breath 
one soul be lose a tiny soul -PRON- 
-PRON- flicker once and go out forget lost

a few of the faithful still linger pray before one of the sidealtar or kneel in the bench near the confessional 
-PRON- approach timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the church 
the board on which -PRON- kneel be narrow and worn and those who knelt near -PRON- be humble follower of jesus 
jesus too have be bear in poverty and have work in the shop of a carpenter cut board and plane -PRON- and have first speak of the kingdom of god to poor fisherman teach all man to be meek and humble of heart

and -PRON- will promise god now that by -PRON- holy grace -PRON- will never offend -PRON- any more by that wicked sin 
-PRON- will make that solemn promise to god will -PRON- not 
yes father 
the old and weary voice fall like sweet rain upon -PRON- quaking parch heart 
how sweet and sad 
do so -PRON- poor child 
the devil have lead -PRON- astray 
drive -PRON- back to hell when -PRON- tempt -PRON- to dishonour -PRON- body in that waythe foul spirit who hate -PRON- lord 
promise god now that -PRON- will give up that sin that wretche wretched sin 
blind by -PRON- tear and by the light of mercifulness -PRON- bend -PRON- head and hear the grave word of absolution speak and see the priest hand raise above -PRON- in token of forgiveness 
god bless -PRON- -PRON- child 
pray for -PRON- 
-PRON- kneel to say -PRON- penance pray in a corner of the dark nave and -PRON- prayer ascend to heaven from -PRON- purified heart like perfume stream upwards from a heart of white rose 
the muddy street be gay 
-PRON- stride homeward conscious of an invisible grace pervade and make light -PRON- limb 
in spite of all -PRON- have do -PRON- 
-PRON- have confess and god have pardon -PRON- 
-PRON- soul be make fair and holy once more holy and happy 
-PRON- would be beautiful to die if god so willed 
-PRON- be beautiful to live in grace a life of peace and virtue and forbearance with other 
-PRON- sit by the fire in the kitchen not dare to speak for happiness 
till that moment -PRON- have not know how beautiful and peaceful life could be 
the green square of paper pin round the lamp cast down a tender shade 
on the dresser be a plate of sausage and white pudding and on the shelf there be egg 
-PRON- would be for the breakfast in the morning after the communion in the college chapel 
white pudding and egg and sausage and cup of tea 
how simple and beautiful be life after all 
and life lie all before -PRON- 
in a dream -PRON- fall asleep 
in a dream -PRON- rise and see that -PRON- be morning 
in a wake dream -PRON- go through the quiet morning towards the college 
the boy be all there kneel in -PRON- place 
-PRON- kneel among -PRON- happy and shy 
the altar be heap with fragrant masse of white flower and in the morning light the pale flame of the candle among the white flower be clear and silent as -PRON- own soul 
-PRON- kneel before the altar with -PRON- classmate hold the altar cloth with -PRON- over a live rail of hand 
-PRON- hand be tremble and -PRON- soul tremble as -PRON- hear the priest pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant 
corpus domini nostri 
could -PRON- be 
-PRON- kneel there sinless and timid and -PRON- would hold upon -PRON- tongue the host and god would enter -PRON- purified body 
in vitam eternam 
amen another life 
a life of grace and virtue and happiness 
-PRON- be true 
-PRON- be not a dream from which -PRON- would wake 
the past be past 
corpus domini nostri 
the ciborium have come to -PRON- 
chapter sunday be dedicated to the mystery of the holy trinity monday to the holy ghost tuesday to the guardian angel wednesday to saint joseph thursday to the most blessed sacrament of the altar friday to the suffer jesus saturday to the bless virgin mary 
every morning -PRON- hallow -PRON- anew in the presence of some holy image or mystery 
-PRON- day begin with an heroic offering of -PRON- every moment of thought or action for the intention of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass 
the raw morning air whet -PRON- resolute piety and often as -PRON- kneel among the few worshipper at the sidealtar follow with -PRON- interleave prayerbook the murmur of the priest -PRON- glance up for an instant towards the vested figure stand in the gloom between the two candle which be the old and the new testament and imagine that -PRON- be kneel at mass in the catacomb 
-PRON- daily life be lay out in devotional area 
by mean of ejaculation and prayer -PRON- store up ungrudgingly for the soul in purgatory century of day and quarantine and year yet the spiritual triumph which -PRON- feel in achieve with ease so many fabulous age of canonical penance do not wholly reward -PRON- zeal of prayer since -PRON- could never know how much temporal punishment -PRON- have remit by way of suffrage for the agonising soul and fearful lest in the midst of the purgatorial fire which differ from the infernal only in that -PRON- be not everlaste -PRON- penance may avail no more than a drop of moisture -PRON- drive -PRON- soul daily through an increase circle of work of supererogation 
every part of -PRON- day divide by what -PRON- regard now as the duty of -PRON- station in life circle about -PRON- own centre of spiritual energy 
-PRON- life seem to have draw near to eternity every thought word and deed every instance of consciousness could be make to revibrate radiantly in heaven and at time -PRON- sense of such immediate repercussion be so lively that -PRON- seem to feel -PRON- soul in devotion press like finger the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of -PRON- purchase start forth immediately in heaven not as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slend flower 
the rosary too which -PRON- say constantlyfor -PRON- carry -PRON- bead loose in -PRON- trouser pocket that -PRON- may tell -PRON- as -PRON- walk the streetstransforme -PRON- into coronal of flower of such vague unearthly texture that -PRON- seem to -PRON- as hueless and odourless as -PRON- be nameless 
-PRON- offer up each of -PRON- three daily chaplet that -PRON- soul may grow strong in each of the three theological virtue in faith in the father who have create -PRON- in hope in the son who have redeem -PRON- and in love of the holy ghost who have sanctify -PRON- and this thrice triple prayer -PRON- offer to the three person through mary in the name of -PRON- joyful and sorrowful and glorious mystery 
on each of the seven day of the week -PRON- further pray that one of the seven gift of the holy ghost may descend upon -PRON- soul and drive out of -PRON- day by day the seven deadly sin which have defile -PRON- in the past and -PRON- pray for each gift on -PRON- appoint day confident that -PRON- would descend upon -PRON- though -PRON- seem strange to -PRON- at time that wisdom and understanding and knowledge be so distinct in -PRON- nature that each should be pray for apart from the other 
yet -PRON- believe that at some future stage of -PRON- spiritual progress this difficulty would be remove when -PRON- sinful soul have be raise up from -PRON- weakness and enlighten by the third person of the most blessed trinity 
-PRON- believe this all the more and with trepidation because of the divine gloom and silence wherein dwell the unseen paraclete whose symbol be a dove and a mighty wind to sin against whom be a sin beyond forgiveness the eternal mysterious secret being to whom as god the priest offer up mass once a year robed in the scarlet of the tongue of fire 
the imagery through which the nature and kinship of the three person of the trinity be darkly shadow forth in the book of devotion which -PRON- readthe father contemplate from all eternity as in a mirror -PRON- divine perfection and thereby beget eternally the eternal son and the holy spirit proceed out of father and son from all eternitywere easy of acceptance by -PRON- mind by reason of -PRON- august incomprehensibility than be the simple fact that god have love -PRON- soul from all eternity for age before -PRON- have be bear into the world for age before the world -PRON- have exist 
-PRON- have hear the name of the passion of love and hate pronounce solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit have find -PRON- set forth solemnly in book and have wonder why -PRON- soul be unable to harbour -PRON- for any time or to force -PRON- lip to utter -PRON- name with conviction 
a brief anger have often invest -PRON- but -PRON- have never be able to make -PRON- an abide passion and have always feel -PRON- pass out of -PRON- as if -PRON- very body be be divest with ease of some outer skin or peel 
-PRON- have feel a subtle dark and murmurous presence penetrate -PRON- being and fire -PRON- with a brief iniquitous lust -PRON- too have slip beyond -PRON- grasp leave -PRON- mind lucid and indifferent 
this -PRON- seem be the only love and that the only hate -PRON- soul would harbour 
but -PRON- could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since god -PRON- have love -PRON- individual soul with divine love from all eternity 
gradually as -PRON- soul be enrich with spiritual knowledge -PRON- see the whole world form one vast symmetrical expression of power and love 
life become a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which be -PRON- even the sight of a single leaf hang on the twig of a tree -PRON- soul should praise and thank the giver 
the world for all -PRON- solid substance and complexity no longer exist for -PRON- soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality 
so entire and unquestionable be this sense of the divine meaning in all nature grant to -PRON- soul that -PRON- could scarcely understand why -PRON- be in any way necessary that -PRON- should continue to live 
yet that be part of the divine purpose and -PRON- dare not question -PRON- use -PRON- above all other who have sin so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose 
meek and abase by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent perfect reality -PRON- soul take up again -PRON- burden of piety masse and prayer and sacrament and mortification and only then for the first time since -PRON- have brood on the great mystery of love do -PRON- feel within -PRON- a warm movement like that of some newly bear life or virtue of the soul -PRON- 
the attitude of rapture in sacred art the raise and part hand the part lip and eye as of one about to swoon become for -PRON- an image of the soul in prayer humiliate and faint before -PRON- creator 
but -PRON- have be forewarn of the danger of spiritual exaltation and do not allow -PRON- to desist from even the least or lowly devotion strive also by constant mortification to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught with peril 
each of -PRON- sense be bring under a rigorous discipline 
in order to mortify the sense of sight -PRON- make -PRON- -PRON- rule to walk in the street with downcast eye glance neither to right nor leave and never behind -PRON- 
-PRON- eye shun every encounter with the eye of woman 
from time to time also -PRON- balk -PRON- by a sudden effort of the will as by lift -PRON- suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and close the book 
to mortify -PRON- hearing -PRON- exert no control over -PRON- voice which be then break neither sing nor whistle and make no attempt to flee from noise which cause -PRON- painful nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knife on the knifeboard the gathering of cinder on the fireshovel and the twigging of the carpet 
to mortify -PRON- smell be more difficult as -PRON- find in -PRON- no instinctive repugnance to bad odour whether -PRON- be the odour of the outdoor world such as those of dung or tar or the odour of -PRON- own person among which -PRON- have make many curious comparison and experiment 
-PRON- find in the end that the only odour against which -PRON- sense of smell revolt be a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstande urine and whenever -PRON- be possible -PRON- subject -PRON- to this unpleasant odour 
to mortify the taste -PRON- practise strict habit at table observe to the letter all the fast of the church and seek by distraction to divert -PRON- mind from the savour of different food 
but -PRON- be to the mortification of touch -PRON- bring the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness 
-PRON- never consciously change -PRON- position in bed sit in the most uncomfortable position suffer patiently every itch and pain keep away from the fire remain on -PRON- knee all through the mass except at the gospel leave part of -PRON- neck and face undried so that air may ste -PRON- and whenever -PRON- be not say -PRON- bead carry -PRON- arm stiffly at -PRON- side like a runner and never in -PRON- pocket or clasp behind -PRON- 
-PRON- have no temptation to sin mortally 
-PRON- surprise -PRON- however to find that at the end of -PRON- course of intricate piety and selfrestraint -PRON- be so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfection 
-PRON- prayer and fast avail -PRON- little for the suppression of anger at hear -PRON- mother sneeze or at be disturb in -PRON- devotion 
-PRON- need an immense effort of -PRON- will to master the impulse which urge -PRON- to give outlet to such irritation 
image of the outburst of trivial anger which -PRON- have often note among -PRON- master -PRON- twitch mouth closeshut lip and flushed cheek recur to -PRON- memory discourage -PRON- for all -PRON- practice of humility by the comparison 
to merge -PRON- life in the common tide of other life be hard for -PRON- than any fasting or prayer and -PRON- be -PRON- constant failure to do this to -PRON- own satisfaction which cause in -PRON- soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubt and scruple 
-PRON- soul traverse a period of desolation in which the sacrament -PRON- seem to have turn into dry up source 
-PRON- confession become a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfection 
-PRON- actual reception of the eucharist do not bring -PRON- the same dissolving moment of virginal selfsurrender as do those spiritual communion make by -PRON- sometimes at the close of some visit to the bless sacrament 
the book which -PRON- use for these visit be an old neglect book write by saint alphonsus liguori with fade character and sere foxpapere leave 
a faded world of fervent love and virginal response seem to be evoke for -PRON- soul by the reading of -PRON- page in which the imagery of the canticle be interweave with the communicant prayer 
an inaudible voice seem to caress the soul tell -PRON- name and glory bid -PRON- arise as for espousal and come away bid -PRON- look forth a spouse from amana and from the mountain of the leopard and the soul seem to answer with the same inaudible voice surrender -PRON- inter ubera mea commorabitur this idea of surrender have a perilous attraction for -PRON- mind now that -PRON- feel -PRON- soul beset once again by the insistent voice of the flesh which begin to murmur to -PRON- again during -PRON- prayer and meditation 
-PRON- give -PRON- an intense sense of power to know that -PRON- could by a single act of consent in a moment of thought undo all that -PRON- have do 
-PRON- seem to feel a flood slowly advance towards -PRON- naked foot and to be wait for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch -PRON- fevered skin 
then almost at the instant of that touch almost at the verge of sinful consent -PRON- find -PRON- stand far away from the flood upon a dry shore save by a sudden act of the will or a sudden ejaculation and see the silver line of the flood far away and begin again -PRON- slow advance towards -PRON- foot a new thrill of power and satisfaction shake -PRON- soul to know that -PRON- have not yield nor undo all 
when -PRON- have elude the flood of temptation many time in this way -PRON- grow troubled and wonder whether the grace which -PRON- have refuse to lose be not be filch from -PRON- little by little 
the clear certitude of -PRON- own immunity grow dim and to -PRON- succeed a vague fear that -PRON- soul have really fall unaware 
-PRON- be with difficulty that -PRON- win back -PRON- old consciousness of -PRON- state of grace by tell -PRON- that -PRON- have pray to god at every temptation and that the grace which -PRON- have pray for must have be give to -PRON- inasmuch as god be oblige to give -PRON- 
the very frequency and violence of temptation show -PRON- at last the truth of what -PRON- have hear about the trial of the saint 
frequent and violent temptation be a proof that the citadel of the soul have not fall and that the devil rage to make -PRON- fall 
often when -PRON- have confess -PRON- doubt and scruple some momentary inattention at prayer a movement of trivial anger in -PRON- soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act -PRON- be bid by -PRON- confessor to name some sin of -PRON- past life before absolution be give -PRON- 
-PRON- name -PRON- with humility and shame and repent of -PRON- once more 
-PRON- humiliate and shame -PRON- to think that -PRON- would never be free from -PRON- wholly however holily -PRON- may live or whatever virtue or perfection -PRON- may attain 
a restless feeling of guilt would always be present with -PRON- -PRON- would confess and repent and be absolve confess and repent again and be absolve again fruitlessly 
perhaps that first hasty confession wring from -PRON- by the fear of hell have not be good 
perhaps concern only for -PRON- imminent doom -PRON- have not have sincere sorrow for -PRON- sin 
but the sure sign that -PRON- confession have be good and that -PRON- have have sincere sorrow for -PRON- sin be -PRON- know the amendment of -PRON- life have amend -PRON- life have i not -PRON- ask -PRON- 
the director stand in the embrasure of the window -PRON- back to the light lean an elbow on the brown crossblind and as -PRON- speak and smile slowly dangle and loop the cord of the other blind stephen stand before -PRON- follow for a moment with -PRON- eye the waning of the long summer daylight above the roof or the slow deft movement of the priestly finger 
the priest face be in total shadow but the waning daylight from behind -PRON- touch the deeply grooved temple and the curve of the skull 
stephen follow also with -PRON- ear the accent and interval of the priest voice as -PRON- speak gravely and cordially of indifferent theme the vacation which have just end the college of the order abroad the transference of master 
the grave and cordial voice go on easily with -PRON- tale and in the pause stephen feel bind to set -PRON- on again with respectful question 
-PRON- know that the tale be a prelude and -PRON- mind wait for the sequel 
ever since the message of summon have come for -PRON- from the director -PRON- mind have struggle to find the meaning of the message and during the long restless time -PRON- have sit in the college parlour wait for the director to come in -PRON- eye have wander from one sober picture to another around the wall and -PRON- mind wander from one guess to another until the meaning of the summon have almost become clear 
then just as -PRON- be wish that some unforeseen cause may prevent the director from come -PRON- have hear the handle of the door turn and the swish of a soutane 
the director have begin to speak of the dominican and franciscan order and of the friendship between saint thomas and saint bonaventure 
the capuchin dress -PRON- think be rather too face give back the priest indulgent smile and not be anxious to give an opinion -PRON- make a slight dubitative movement with -PRON- lip believe continue the director that there be some talk now among the capuchin -PRON- of do away with -PRON- and follow the example of the other franciscan suppose -PRON- would retain -PRON- in the cloister say stephen certainly say the director 
for the cloister -PRON- be all right but for the street i really think -PRON- would be well to do away with -PRON- donot -PRON- 
-PRON- must be troublesome i imagine 
of course -PRON- be of course 
just imagine when i be in belgium i use to see -PRON- out cycle in all kind of weather with this thing up about -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be really ridiculous 
les jupe -PRON- call -PRON- in belgium 
the vowel be so modify as to be indistinct 
what do -PRON- call -PRON- 
les jupe 
stephen smile again in answer to the smile which -PRON- could not see on the priest shadow face -PRON- image or spectre only pass rapidly across -PRON- mind as the low discreet accent fall upon -PRON- ear 
-PRON- gaze calmly before -PRON- at the wane sky glad of the cool of the evening and of the faint yellow glow which hide the tiny flame kindle upon -PRON- cheek 
the name of article of dress wear by woman or of certain soft and delicate stuff use in -PRON- making bring always to -PRON- mind a delicate and sinful perfume 
as a boy -PRON- have imagine the rein by which horse be drive as slender silken band and -PRON- shock -PRON- to feel at stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness 
-PRON- have shock -PRON- too when -PRON- have feel for the first time beneath -PRON- tremulous finger the brittle texture of a woman stock for retain nothing of all -PRON- read save that which seem to -PRON- an echo or a prophecy of -PRON- own state -PRON- be only amid softworde phrase or within rosesoft stuff that -PRON- dare to conceive of the soul or body of a woman move with tender life 
but the phrase on the priest lip be disingenuous for -PRON- know that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme 
the phrase have be speak lightly with design and -PRON- feel that -PRON- face be be search by the eye in the shadow 
whatever -PRON- have hear or read of the craft of jesuit -PRON- have put aside frankly as not bear out by -PRON- own experience 
-PRON- master even when -PRON- have not attract -PRON- have seem to -PRON- always intelligent and serious priest athletic and highspirited prefect 
-PRON- think of -PRON- as man who wash -PRON- body briskly with cold water and wear clean cold linen 
during all the year -PRON- have live among -PRON- in clongowes and in belvedere -PRON- have receive only two pandie and though these have be deal -PRON- in the wrong -PRON- know that -PRON- have often escape punishment 
during all those year -PRON- have never hear from any of -PRON- master a flippant word -PRON- be -PRON- who have teach -PRON- christian doctrine and urge -PRON- to live a good life and when -PRON- have fall into grievous sin -PRON- be -PRON- who have lead -PRON- back to grace 
-PRON- presence have make -PRON- diffident of -PRON- when -PRON- be a muff in clongowes and -PRON- have make -PRON- diffident of -PRON- also while -PRON- have hold -PRON- equivocal position in belvedere 
a constant sense of this have remain with -PRON- up to the last year of -PRON- school life 
-PRON- have never once disobey or allow turbulent companion to seduce -PRON- from -PRON- habit of quiet obedience and even when -PRON- doubt some statement of a master -PRON- have never presume to doubt openly 
lately some of -PRON- judgement have sound a little childish in -PRON- ear and have make -PRON- feel a regret and pity as though -PRON- be slowly pass out of an accustomed world and be hear -PRON- language for the last time 
one day when some boy have gather round a priest under the shed near the chapel -PRON- have hear the priest say believe that lord macaulay be a man who probably never commit a mortal sin in -PRON- life that be to say a deliberate mortal sin 
some of the boy have then ask the priest if victor hugo be not the great french writer 
the priest have answer that victor hugo have never write half so well when -PRON- have turn against the church as -PRON- have write when -PRON- be a catholic 
but there be many eminent french critic say the priest who consider that even victor hugo great as -PRON- certainly be have not so pure a french style as louis veuillot 
the tiny flame which the priest allusion have kindle upon cheek have sink down again and -PRON- eye be still fix calmly on the colourless sky 
but an unresting doubt fly hither and thither before -PRON- mind 
masked memory pass quickly before -PRON- -PRON- recognise scene and person yet -PRON- be conscious that -PRON- have fail to perceive some vital circumstance in -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- walk about the ground watch the sport in clongowes and eat slim jim out of -PRON- cricketcap 
some jesuit be walk round the cycletrack in the company of lady 
the echo of certain expression use in clongowes sound in remote cave of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- ear be listen to these distant echo amid the silence of the parlour when -PRON- become aware that the priest be address -PRON- in a different voice send for -PRON- today stephen because i wish to speak to -PRON- on a very important subject 
yes sir 
have -PRON- ever feel that -PRON- have a vocation 
stephen part -PRON- lip to answer yes and then withhold the word suddenly 
the priest wait for the answer and add mean have -PRON- ever feel within -PRON- in -PRON- soul a desire to join the order 
think have sometimes think of -PRON- say stephen 
the priest let the blindcord fall to one side and unite -PRON- hand lean -PRON- chin gravely upon -PRON- commune with -PRON- 
in a college like this -PRON- say at length there be one boy or perhaps two or three boy whom god call to the religious life 
such a boy be mark off from -PRON- companion by -PRON- piety by the good example -PRON- show to other 
-PRON- be look up to by -PRON- -PRON- be choose perhaps as prefect by -PRON- fellow sodalist 
and -PRON- stephen have be such a boy in this college prefect of -PRON- blessed sodality 
perhaps -PRON- be the boy in this college whom god design to call to -PRON- 
a strong note of pride reinforce the gravity of the priest voice make heart quicken in response 
to receive that call stephen say the priest be the great honour that the almighty god can bestow upon a man 
no king or emperor on this earth have the power of the priest of god 
no angel or archangel in heaven no saint not even the bless virgin -PRON- have the power of a priest of god the power of the key the power to bind and to loose from sin the power of exorcism the power to cast out from the creature of god the evil spirit that have power over -PRON- the power the authority to make the great god of heaven come down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine 
what an awful power stephen 
a flame begin to flutter again on cheek as -PRON- hear in this proud address an echo of -PRON- own proud musing 
how often have -PRON- see -PRON- as a priest wield calmly and humbly the awful power of which angel and saint stand in reverence 
-PRON- soul have love to muse in secret on this desire 
-PRON- have see -PRON- a young and silentmannered priest enter a confessional swiftly ascend the altarstep incense genuflect accomplish the vague act of the priesthood which please -PRON- by reason of -PRON- semblance of reality and of -PRON- distance from -PRON- 
in that dim life which -PRON- have live through in -PRON- musing -PRON- have assume the voice and gesture which -PRON- have note with various priest 
-PRON- have bend -PRON- knee sideways like such a one -PRON- have shake the thurible only slightly like such a one -PRON- chasuble have swing open like that of such another as -PRON- turn to the altar again after have bless the people 
and above all -PRON- have please -PRON- to fill the second place in those dim scene of -PRON- imagining 
-PRON- shrink from the dignity of celebrant because -PRON- displease -PRON- to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in -PRON- own person or that the ritual should assign to -PRON- so clear and final an office 
-PRON- long for the minor sacred office to be vest with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass to stand aloof from the altar forget by the people -PRON- shoulder cover with a humeral veil hold the paten within -PRON- fold or when the sacrifice have be accomplish to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant -PRON- hand join and -PRON- face towards the people and sing the chant ite missa est if ever -PRON- have see -PRON- celebrant -PRON- be as in the picture of the mass in -PRON- child massbook in a church without worshipper save for the angel of the sacrifice at a bare altar and serve by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than -PRON- 
in vague sacrificial or sacramental act alone -PRON- will seem draw to go forth to encounter reality and -PRON- be partly the absence of an appoint rite which have always constrain -PRON- to inaction whether -PRON- have allow silence to cover -PRON- anger or pride or have suffer only an embrace -PRON- long to give 
-PRON- listen in reverent silence now to the priest appeal and through the word -PRON- hear even more distinctly a voice bid -PRON- approach offer -PRON- secret knowledge and secret power 
-PRON- would know then what be the sin of simon magus and what the sin against the holy ghost for which there be no forgiveness 
-PRON- would know obscure thing hide from other from those who be conceive and bear child of wrath 
-PRON- would know the sin the sinful longing and sinful thought and sinful act of other hear -PRON- murmur into -PRON- ear in the confessional under the shame of a darken chapel by the lip of woman and of girl but render immune mysteriously at -PRON- ordination by the imposition of hand -PRON- soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of the altar 
no touch of sin would linger upon the hand with which -PRON- would elevate and break the host no touch of sin would linger on -PRON- lip in prayer to make -PRON- eat and drink damnation to -PRON- not discern the body of the lord 
-PRON- would hold -PRON- secret knowledge and secret power be as sinless as the innocent and -PRON- would be a priest for ever accord to the order of melchisedec will offer up -PRON- mass tomorrow morning say the director that almighty god may reveal to -PRON- -PRON- holy will 
and let -PRON- stephen make a novena to -PRON- holy patron saint the first martyr who be very powerful with god that god may enlighten -PRON- mind 
but -PRON- must be quite sure stephen that -PRON- have a vocation because -PRON- would be terrible if -PRON- find afterwards that -PRON- have none 
once a priest always a priest remember 
-PRON- catechism tell -PRON- that the sacrament of holy order be one of those which can be receive only once because -PRON- imprint on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be efface 
-PRON- be before -PRON- must weigh well not after 
-PRON- be a solemn question stephen because on -PRON- may depend the salvation of -PRON- eternal soul 
but -PRON- will pray to god together 
-PRON- hold open the heavy hall door and give -PRON- hand as if already to a companion in the spiritual life 
stephen pass out on to the wide platform above the step and be conscious of the caress of mild evening air 
towards church a quartet of young man be stride along with link arm sway -PRON- head and step to the agile melody of -PRON- leader concertina 
the music pass in an instant as the first bar of sudden music always do over the fantastic fabric of -PRON- mind dissolve -PRON- painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolve the sandbuilt turret of child 
smile at the trivial air -PRON- raise -PRON- eye to the priest face and see in -PRON- a mirthless reflection of the sink day detach -PRON- hand slowly which have acquiesce faintly in that companionship 
as -PRON- descend the step the impression which efface -PRON- troubled selfcommunion be that of a mirthless mask reflect a sink day from the threshold of the college 
the shadow then of the life of the college pass gravely over -PRON- consciousness 
-PRON- be a grave and order and passionless life that await -PRON- a life without material care 
-PRON- wonder how -PRON- would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what dismay -PRON- would wake the first morning in the dormitory 
the troubling odour of the long corridor of clongowes come back to -PRON- and -PRON- hear the discreet murmur of the burn gasflame 
at once from every part of -PRON- be unrest begin to irradiate 
a feverish quickening of -PRON- pulse follow and a din of meaningless word drive -PRON- reason thought hither and thither confusedly 
-PRON- lung dilate and sink as if -PRON- be inhale a warm moist unsustaining air and -PRON- smell again the moist warm air which hang in the bath in clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water 
some instinct wake at these memory strong than education or piety quicken within -PRON- at every near approach to that life an instinct subtle and hostile and arm -PRON- against acquiescence 
the chill and order of the life repel -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- rise in the cold of the morning and filing down with the other to early mass and try vainly to struggle with -PRON- prayer against the fainting sickness of -PRON- stomach 
-PRON- see -PRON- sit at dinner with the community of a college 
what then have become of that deeproote shyness of -PRON- which have make -PRON- loth to eat or drink under a strange roof 
what have come of the pride of -PRON- spirit which have always make -PRON- conceive -PRON- as a being apart in every order 
the reverend stephen dedalus -PRON- name in that new life leap into character before -PRON- eye and to -PRON- there follow a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of a face 
the colour fade and become strong like a change glow of pallid brick red 
be -PRON- the raw reddish glow -PRON- have so often see on wintry morning on the shaven gill of the priest 
the face be eyeless and sourfavoure and devout shot with pink tinge of suffocated anger 
be -PRON- not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuit whom some of the boy call lantern jaw and other foxy campbell 
-PRON- be pass at that moment before the jesuit house in gardiner street and wonder vaguely which window would be -PRON- if -PRON- ever join the order 
then -PRON- wonder at the vagueness of -PRON- wonder at the remoteness of -PRON- own soul from what -PRON- have hitherto imagine -PRON- sanctuary at the frail hold which so many year of order and obedience have of -PRON- when once a definite and irrevocable act of -PRON- threaten to end for ever in time and in eternity -PRON- freedom 
the voice of the director urge upon -PRON- the proud claim of the church and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeat -PRON- idly in -PRON- memory 
-PRON- soul be not there to hear and greet -PRON- and -PRON- know now that the exhortation -PRON- have listen to have already fall into an idle formal tale 
-PRON- would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as priest 
-PRON- destiny be to be elusive of social or religious order 
the wisdom of the priest appeal do not touch -PRON- to the quick 
-PRON- be destine to learn -PRON- own wisdom apart from other or to learn the wisdom of other -PRON- wander among the snare of the world 
the snare of the world be -PRON- way of sin 
-PRON- would fall 
-PRON- have not yet fall but -PRON- would fall silently in an instant 
not to fall be too hard too hard and -PRON- feel the silent lapse of -PRON- soul as -PRON- would be at some instant to come fall fall but not yet fall still unfallen but about to fall 
-PRON- cross the bridge over the stream of the tolka and turn -PRON- eye coldly for an instant towards the faded blue shrine of the bless virgin which stand fowlwise on a pole in the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottage 
then bend to the left -PRON- follow the lane which lead up to -PRON- house 
the faint sour stink of rot cabbage come towards -PRON- from the kitchen garden on the rise ground above the river 
-PRON- smile to think that -PRON- be this disorder the misrule and confusion of -PRON- father house and the stagnation of vegetable life which be to win the day in -PRON- soul 
then a short laugh break from -PRON- lip as -PRON- think of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen garden behind -PRON- house whom -PRON- have nickname the man with the hat 
a second laugh take rise from the first after a pause break from -PRON- involuntarily as -PRON- think of how the man with the hat work consider in turn the four point of the sky and then regretfully plunge -PRON- spade in the earth 
-PRON- push open the latchless door of the porch and pass through the naked hallway into the kitchen 
a group of -PRON- brother and sister be sit round the table 
tea be nearly over and only the last of the second water tea remain in the bottom of the small glass jar and jampot which do service for teacup 
discard crust and lump of sugar bread turn brown by the tea which have be pour over -PRON- lie scatter on the table 
little well of tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle be stick through the pith of a ravage turnover 
the sad quiet greyblue glow of the die day come through the window and the open door cover over and allay quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in heart 
all that have be deny -PRON- have be freely give to -PRON- the eld but the quiet glow of evening show -PRON- in -PRON- face no sign of rancour 
-PRON- sit near -PRON- at the table and ask where -PRON- father and mother be 
one answer goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro 
still another removal 
a boy name fallon in belvedere have often ask -PRON- with a silly laugh why -PRON- move so often 
a frown of scorn darken quickly -PRON- forehead as -PRON- hear again the silly laugh of the questioner 
-PRON- ask why be -PRON- on the move again if -PRON- a fair question 
becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro usboro outboro 
the voice of -PRON- young brother from the farther side of the fireplace begin to sing the air oft in the stilly night 
one by one the other take up the air until a full choir of voice be singe 
-PRON- would sing so for hour melody after melody glee after glee till the last pale light die down on the horizon till the first dark nightcloud come forth and night fall 
-PRON- wait for some moment listen before -PRON- too take up the air with -PRON- 
-PRON- be listen with pain of spirit to the overtone of weariness behind -PRON- frail fresh innocent voice 
even before -PRON- set out on life journey -PRON- seem weary already of the way 
-PRON- hear the choir of voice in the kitchen echo and multiply through an endless reverberation of the choir of endless generation of child and hear in all the echo an echo also of the recur note of weariness and pain 
all seem weary of life even before enter upon -PRON- 
and -PRON- remember that newman have hear this note also in the broken line of virgil give utterance like the voice of nature -PRON- to that pain and weariness yet hope of well thing which have be the experience of -PRON- child in every time 
-PRON- could wait no longer 
from the door of publichouse to the gate of clontarf chapel from the gate of clontarf chapel to the door of publichouse and then back again to the chapel and then back again to the publichouse -PRON- have pace slowly at first plant -PRON- step scrupulously in the space of the patchwork of the footpath then time -PRON- fall to the fall of verse 
a full hour have pass since -PRON- father have go in with dan crosby the tutor to find out for -PRON- something about the university 
for a full hour -PRON- have pace up and down wait but -PRON- could wait no longer 
-PRON- set off abruptly for the bull walk rapidly lest -PRON- father shrill whistle may call -PRON- back and in a few moment -PRON- have round the curve at the police barrack and be safe 
yes -PRON- mother be hostile to the idea as -PRON- have read from -PRON- listless silence 
yet -PRON- mistrust prick -PRON- more keenly than -PRON- father pride and -PRON- think coldly how -PRON- have watch the faith which be fade down in -PRON- soul age and strengthen in -PRON- eye 
a dim antagonism gather force within -PRON- and darken -PRON- mind as a cloud against -PRON- disloyalty and when -PRON- pass cloudlike leave -PRON- mind serene and dutiful towards -PRON- again -PRON- be make aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of -PRON- life 
the university 
so -PRON- have pass beyond the challenge of the sentry who have stand as guardian of -PRON- boyhood and have seek to keep -PRON- among -PRON- that -PRON- may be subject to -PRON- and serve -PRON- end 
pride after satisfaction uplift -PRON- like long slow wave 
the end -PRON- have be bear to serve yet do not see have lead -PRON- to escape by an unseen path and now -PRON- beckon to -PRON- once more and a new adventure be about to be open to -PRON- 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- hear note of fitful music leap upwards a tone and downward a diminished fourth upwards a tone and downward a major third like triplebranche flame leap fitfully flame after flame out of a midnight wood 
-PRON- be an elfin prelude endless and formless and as -PRON- grow wilder and faster the flame leap out of time -PRON- seem to hear from under the bough and grass wild creature race -PRON- foot patter like rain upon the leave 
-PRON- foot pass in patter tumult over -PRON- mind the foot of hare and rabbit the foot of hart and hind and antelope until -PRON- hear -PRON- no more and remember only a proud cadence from newman whose foot be as the foot of hart and underneath the everlasting arm 
the pride of that dim image bring back to -PRON- mind the dignity of the office -PRON- have refuse 
all through -PRON- boyhood -PRON- have muse upon that which -PRON- have so often think to be -PRON- destiny and when the moment have come for -PRON- to obey the call -PRON- have turn aside obey a wayward instinct 
now time lie between the oil of ordination would never anoint -PRON- body 
-PRON- have refuse 
why 
-PRON- turn seaward from the road at dollymount and as -PRON- pass on to the thin wooden bridge -PRON- feel the plank shake with the tramp of heavily shod foot 
a squad of christian brother be on -PRON- way back from the bull and have begin to pass two by two across the bridge 
soon the whole bridge be tremble and resounding 
the uncouth face pass -PRON- two by two stain yellow or red or livid by the sea and as -PRON- strive to look at -PRON- with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rise to -PRON- own face 
angry with -PRON- -PRON- try to hide -PRON- face from -PRON- eye by gaze down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but -PRON- still see a reflection therein of -PRON- topheavy silk hat and humble tapelike collar and loosely hang clerical clothe 
brother hickey 
brother quaid 
brother brother keogh 
-PRON- piety would be like -PRON- name like -PRON- face like -PRON- clothe and -PRON- be idle for -PRON- to tell -PRON- that -PRON- humble and contrite heart -PRON- may be pay a far rich tribute of devotion than -PRON- have ever be a gift tenfold more acceptable than -PRON- elaborate adoration 
-PRON- be idle for -PRON- to move -PRON- to be generous towards -PRON- to tell -PRON- that if -PRON- ever come to -PRON- gate strip of -PRON- pride beat and in beggar weed that -PRON- would be generous towards -PRON- love -PRON- as -PRON- 
idle and embitter finally to argue against -PRON- own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bid -PRON- not to love -PRON- neighbour as -PRON- with the same amount and intensity of love but to love -PRON- as -PRON- with the same kind of love 
-PRON- draw forth a phrase from -PRON- treasure and speak -PRON- softly to -PRON- day of dappled seaborne cloud 
the phrase and the day and the scene harmonise in a chord 
word 
be -PRON- -PRON- colour 
-PRON- allow -PRON- to glow and fade hue after hue sunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchard azure of wave the greyfringed fleece of cloud 
no -PRON- be not -PRON- colour -PRON- be the poise and balance of the period -PRON- 
do -PRON- then love the rhythmic rise and fall of word well than -PRON- association of legend and colour 
or be -PRON- that be as weak of sight as -PRON- be shy of mind -PRON- draw less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloure and richly story than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotion mirror perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose 
-PRON- pass from the trembling bridge on to firm land again 
at that instant as -PRON- seem to -PRON- the air be chill and look askance towards the water -PRON- see a fly squall darken and crisp suddenly the tide 
a faint click at -PRON- heart a faint throb in -PRON- throat tell -PRON- once more of how -PRON- flesh dread the cold infrahuman odour of the sea yet -PRON- do not strike across the down on -PRON- left but hold straight on along the spine of rock that point against the river mouth 
a veiled sunlight light up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river be embaye 
in the distance along the course of the slowflowe liffey slender mast fleck the sky and more distant still the dim fabric of the city lie prone in haze 
like a scene on some vague arra old as man weariness the image of the seventh city of christendom be visible to -PRON- across the timeless air no old nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the day of the thingmote 
dishearten -PRON- raise -PRON- eye towards the slowdrifte cloud dapple and seaborne 
-PRON- be voyage across the desert of the sky a host of nomad on the march voyage high over ireland westward bound 
the europe -PRON- have come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongue and valleye and woodbegirt and citadelle and of entrenched and marshal race 
-PRON- hear a confused music within -PRON- as of memory and name which -PRON- be almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant then the music seem to recede to recede to recede and from each recede trail of nebulous music there fall always one longdrawn call note piercing like a star the dusk of silence

-PRON- start up nervously from the stoneblock for -PRON- could no longer quench the flame in -PRON- blood 
-PRON- feel -PRON- cheek aflame and -PRON- throat throb with song 
there be a lust of wander in -PRON- foot that burn to set out for the end of the earth

evening would deepen above the sea night fall upon the plain dawn glimmer before the wanderer and show -PRON- strange field and hill and face 
where 
-PRON- look northward towards howth 
the sea have fall below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater and already the tide be run out fast along the foreshore 
already one long oval bank of sand lie warm and dry amid the wavelet

there be a long rivulet in the strand and as -PRON- wade slowly up -PRON- course -PRON- wonder at the endless drift of seaweed 
emerald and black and russet and olive -PRON- move beneath the current swaying and turning 
the water of the rivulet be dark with endless drift and mirror the highdrifting cloud 
the cloud be drift above -PRON- silently and silently the seatangle be drift below -PRON- and the grey warm air be still and a new wild life be singe in -PRON- vein 
where be -PRON- boyhood now 
where be the soul that have hang back from -PRON- destiny to brood alone upon the shame of -PRON- wound and in -PRON- house of squalor and subterfuge to queen -PRON- in fade cerement and in wreath that wither at the touch 
or where be -PRON- 
-PRON- be alone 
-PRON- be unheede happy and near to the wild heart of life 
-PRON- be alone and young and wilful and wildhearte alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish water and the seaharv of shell and tangle and veil grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figure of child and girl and voice childish and girlish in the air 
a girl stand before -PRON- in midstream alone and still gaze out to sea 
-PRON- seem like one whom magic have change into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird 
-PRON- long slender bare leg be delicate as a crane and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed have fashion -PRON- as a sign upon the flesh

a wild angel have appear to -PRON- the angel of mortal youth and beauty an envoy from the fair court of life to throw open before -PRON- in an instant of ecstasy the gate of all the way of error and glory 
on and on and on and on 
-PRON- halt suddenly and hear -PRON- heart in the silence 
how far have -PRON- walk 
what hour be -PRON- 
there be no human figure near -PRON- nor any sound bear to -PRON- over the air 
but the tide be near the turn and already the day be on the wane 
-PRON- turn landward and run towards the shore and run up the slope beach reckless of the sharp shingle find a sandy nook amid a ring of tufte sandknoll and lie down there that the peace and silence of the evening may still the riot of -PRON- blood 
-PRON- feel above -PRON- the vast indifferent dome and the calm process of the heavenly body and the earth beneath -PRON- the earth that have bear -PRON- have take -PRON- to -PRON- breast 
-PRON- close -PRON- eye in the languor of sleep 
-PRON- eyelid tremble as if -PRON- feel the vast cyclic movement of the earth and -PRON- watcher tremble as if -PRON- feel the strange light of some new world 
-PRON- soul be swoon into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as under sea traverse by cloudy shape and being

evening have fall when -PRON- wake and the sand and arid grass of -PRON- bed glow no longer 
-PRON- rise slowly and recall the rapture of -PRON- sleep sigh at -PRON- joy 
-PRON- climb to the crest of the sandhill and gaze about -PRON-

well -PRON- a poor case -PRON- say when a university student be so dirty that -PRON- mother have to wash -PRON- 
but -PRON- give -PRON- pleasure say stephen calmly

-PRON- shake the sound out of -PRON- ear by an angry toss of -PRON- head and hurry on stumble through the moulder offal -PRON- heart already bite by an ache of loathing and bitterness 
-PRON- father whistle -PRON- mother muttering the screech of an unseen maniac be to -PRON- now so many voice offend and threaten to humble the pride of -PRON- youth 
-PRON- drive -PRON- echo even out of -PRON- heart with an execration but as -PRON- walk down the avenue and feel the grey morning light fall about -PRON- through the dripping tree and smell the strange wild smell of the wet leave and bark -PRON- soul be loose of -PRON- misery 
the rainladen tree of the avenue evoke in -PRON- as always memory of the girl and woman in the play of gerhart hauptmann and the memory of -PRON- pale sorrow and the fragrance fall from the wet branch mingle in a mood of quiet joy 
-PRON- morning walk across the city have begin and -PRON- foreknow that as -PRON- pass the slobland of fairview -PRON- would think of the cloistral silverveine prose of newman that as -PRON- walk along the north strand road glance idly at the window of the provision shop -PRON- would recall the dark humour of guido cavalcanti and smile that as -PRON- go by stonecutte work in talbot place the spirit of ibsen would blow through -PRON- like a keen wind a spirit of wayward boyish beauty and that pass a grimy marine dealer shop beyond the liffey -PRON- would repeat the song by ben jonson which begin i be not weary where i lie 
-PRON- mind when weary of -PRON- search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral word of aristotle or aquinas turn often for -PRON- pleasure to the dainty song of the elizabethan 
-PRON- mind in the vesture of a doubt monk stand often in shadow under the window of that age to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenist or the frank laughter of waistcoateer until a laugh too low a phrase tarnish by time of chambering and false honour sting -PRON- monkish pride and drive -PRON- on from -PRON- lurkingplace 
the lore which -PRON- be believe to pass -PRON- day brood upon so that -PRON- have rapt -PRON- from the companionship of youth be only a garner of slender sentence from poetic and psychology and a synopsis philosophi scholastic ad mentem divi thom 
-PRON- thinking be a dusk of doubt and selfmistrust light up at moment by the lightning of intuition but lightning of so clear a splendour that in those moment the world perish about -PRON- foot as if -PRON- have be fireconsume and thereafter -PRON- tongue grow heavy and -PRON- meet the eye of other with unanswere eye for -PRON- feel that the spirit of beauty have fold -PRON- round like a mantle and that in reverie at least -PRON- have be acquaint with nobility 
but when this brief pride of silence uphold -PRON- no longer -PRON- be glad to find -PRON- still in the midst of common life pass on -PRON- way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart 
near the hoarding on the canal -PRON- meet the consumptive man with the doll face and the brimless hat come towards -PRON- down the slope of the bridge with little step tightly button into -PRON- chocolate overcoat and hold -PRON- furl umbrella a span or two from -PRON- like a divine rod 
-PRON- must be eleven -PRON- think and peer into a dairy to see the time 
the clock in the dairy tell -PRON- that -PRON- be five minute to five but as -PRON- turn away -PRON- hear a clock somewhere near -PRON- but unseen beat eleven stroke in swift precision 
-PRON- laugh as -PRON- hear -PRON- for -PRON- make -PRON- think of and -PRON- see -PRON- a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breech and with a fair goatee stand in the wind at hopkin corner and hear -PRON- say dedalus -PRON- be an antisocial be wrap up in -PRON- not a democrat and work and act for social liberty and equality among all class and sex in the united state of the europe of the future 
eleven 
then -PRON- be late for that lecture too 
what day of the week be -PRON- 
-PRON- stop at a newsagent to read the headline of a placard 
thursday 
ten to eleven english eleven to twelve french twelve to one physics 
-PRON- fancy to -PRON- the english lecture and feel even at that distance restless and helpless 
-PRON- see the head of -PRON- classmate meekly bent as -PRON- write in -PRON- notebook the point -PRON- be bid to note nominal definition essential definition and example or date of birth or death chief work a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side 
-PRON- own head be unbent for -PRON- thought wander abroad and whether -PRON- look around the little class of student or out of the window across the desolate garden of the green an odour assail -PRON- of cheerless cellardamp and decay 
another head than -PRON- right before -PRON- in the first bench be poise squarely above -PRON- bend fellow like the head of a priest appeal without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshipper about -PRON- 
why be -PRON- that when -PRON- think of cranly -PRON- could never raise before -PRON- mind the entire image of -PRON- body but only the image of the head and face 
even now against the grey curtain of the morning -PRON- see -PRON- before -PRON- like the phantom of a dream the face of a sever head or death mask crown on the brow by -PRON- stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown 
-PRON- be a priestlike face priestlike in -PRON- pallor in the wide winged nose in the shadowing below the eye and along the jaws priestlike in the lip that be long and bloodless and faintly smile and stephen remember swiftly how -PRON- have tell cranly of all the tumult and unrest and longing in -PRON- soul day after day and night by night only to be answer by -PRON- friend listen silence would have tell -PRON- that -PRON- be the face of a guilty priest who hear confession of those whom -PRON- have not power to absolve but that -PRON- feel again in memory the gaze of -PRON- dark womanish eye 
through this image -PRON- have a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turn away from -PRON- feel that -PRON- be not yet the hour to enter -PRON- 
but the nightshade of -PRON- friend listlessness seem to be diffuse in the air around -PRON- a tenuous and deadly exhalation and -PRON- find -PRON- glance from one casual word to another on -PRON- right or leave in stolid wonder that -PRON- have be so silently empty of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bind -PRON- mind like the word of a spell and -PRON- soul shrivel up sigh with age as -PRON- walk on in a lane among heap of dead language 
-PRON- own consciousness of language be ebb from -PRON- brain and trickle into the very word -PRON- which set to band and disband -PRON- in wayward rhythm the ivy whine upon the wall and whine and twine upon the wall the yellow ivy upon the wall ivy ivy up the wall 
do anyone ever hear such drivel 
lord almighty 
who ever hear of ivy whine on a wall 
yellow ivy that be all right 
yellow ivory also 
and what about ivory ivy 
the word now shine in -PRON- brain clearer and bright than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusk of elephant 
ivory ivoire avorio ebur one of the first example that -PRON- have learn in latin have run india mittit ebur and -PRON- recall the shrewd northern face of the rector who have teach -PRON- to construe the metamorphosis of ovid in a courtly english make whimsical by the mention of porker and potsherd and chine of bacon 
-PRON- have learn what little -PRON- know of the law of latin verse from a ragged book write by a portuguese priest 
contrahit orator variant in carmine vate 
the crisis and victory and secession in roman history be hand on to -PRON- in the trite word in tanto discrimine and -PRON- have try to peer into the social life of the city of city through the word implere ollam denariorum which the rector have render sonorously as the filling of a pot with denarie 
the page of -PRON- timeworn horace never feel cold to the touch even when -PRON- own finger be cold -PRON- be human page and fifty year before -PRON- have be turn by the human finger of john duncan inverarity and by -PRON- brother william malcolm inverarity 
yes those be noble name on the dusky flyleaf and even for so poor a latinist as -PRON- the dusky verse be as fragrant as though -PRON- have lie all those year in myrtle and lavender and vervain but yet -PRON- wound -PRON- to think that -PRON- would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the world culture and that the monkish learning in term of which -PRON- be strive to forge out an esthetic philosophy be hold no high by the age -PRON- live in than the subtle and curious jargon of heraldry and falconry 
the grey block of trinity on -PRON- left set heavily in the citys ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring pull -PRON- mind downward and while -PRON- be strive this way and that to free -PRON- foot from the fetter of the reformed conscience -PRON- come upon the droll statue of the national poet of ireland 
-PRON- look at -PRON- without anger for though sloth of the body and of the soul creep over -PRON- like unseen vermin over the shuffle foot and up the fold of the cloak and around the servile head -PRON- seem humbly conscious of -PRON- indignity 
-PRON- be a firbolg in the borrow cloak of a milesian and -PRON- think of -PRON- friend davin the peasant student 
-PRON- be a jesting name between -PRON- but the young peasant bear with -PRON- lightly go on stevie i have a hard head -PRON- tell -PRON- 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will 
the homely version of -PRON- christian name on the lip of -PRON- friend have touch stephen pleasantly when first hear for -PRON- be as formal in speech with other as -PRON- be with -PRON- 
often as -PRON- sit in room in grantham street wonder at -PRON- friend wellmade boot that flank the wall pair by pair and repeat for -PRON- friend simple ear the verse and cadence of other which be the veil of -PRON- own longing and dejection the rude firbolg mind of -PRON- listener have draw -PRON- mind towards -PRON- and fling -PRON- back again draw -PRON- by a quiet inbreed courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old english speech or by the force of -PRON- delight in rude bodily skillfor davin have sit at the foot of michael cusack the swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eye the terror of soul of a starve irish village in which the curfew be still a nightly fear 
side by side with -PRON- memory of the deed of prowess of -PRON- uncle mat davin the athlete the young peasant worship the sorrowful legend of ireland 
the gossip of -PRON- fellowstudent which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost love to think of -PRON- as a young fenian 
-PRON- nurse have teach -PRON- irish and shape -PRON- rude imagination by the broken light of irish myth 
-PRON- stand towards the myth upon which no individual mind have ever draw out a line of beauty and to -PRON- unwieldy tale that divide -PRON- as -PRON- move down the cycle in the same attitude as towards the roman catholic religion the attitude of a dullwitte loyal serf 
whatsoever of thought or of feeling come to -PRON- from england or by way of english culture -PRON- mind stand armed against in obedience to a password and of the world that lie beyond england -PRON- know only the foreign legion of france in which -PRON- speak of serve 
couple this ambition with the young man humour stephen have often call -PRON- one of the tame geese and there be even a point of irritation in the name point against that very reluctance of speech and deed in -PRON- friend which seem so often to stand between mind eager of speculation and the hidden way of irish life 
one night the young peasant -PRON- spirit sting by the violent or luxurious language in which stephen escape from the cold silence of intellectual revolt have call up before mind a strange vision 
the two be walk slowly towards room through the dark narrow street of the poor jew thing happen to -PRON- stevie last autumn come on winter and i never tell -PRON- to a live soul and -PRON- be the first person now i ever tell -PRON- to 
i disremember if -PRON- be october or november 
-PRON- be october because -PRON- be before i come up here to join the matriculation class 
stephen have turn -PRON- smile eye towards -PRON- friend face flatter by -PRON- confidence and win over to sympathy by the speaker simple accent be away all that day from -PRON- own place over in buttevanti donot know if -PRON- know where that isat a hurling match between the own boy and the fearless thurle and by god stevie that be the hard fight 
-PRON- first cousin fonsy davin be strip to -PRON- buff that day mind cool for the limerick but -PRON- be up with the forward half the time and shout like mad 
i never will forget that day 
one of the croke make a woeful wipe at -PRON- one time with -PRON- caman and i declare to god -PRON- be within an aim ace of get -PRON- at the side of -PRON- temple 
oh honest to god if the crook of -PRON- catch -PRON- that time -PRON- be do for am glad -PRON- escape stephen have say with a laugh but surely that s not the strange thing that happen -PRON- 
well i suppose that doesnot interest -PRON- but leastway there be such noise after the match that i miss the train home and i couldnot get any kind of a yoke to give -PRON- a lift for as luck would have -PRON- there be a mass meeting that same day over in castletownroche and all the car in the country be there 
so there be nothing for -PRON- only to stay the night or to foot -PRON- out 
well i start to walk and on i go and -PRON- be come on night when i get into the ballyhoura hill that s well than ten mile from kilmallock and there s a long lonely road after that 
-PRON- wouldnot see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound 
-PRON- be pitch dark almost 
once or twice i stop by the way under a bush to redden -PRON- pipe and only for the dew be thick have stretch out there and sleep 
at last after a bend of the road i spy a little cottage with a light in the window 
i go up and knock at the door 
a voice ask who be there and i answer i be over at the match in buttevant and be walk back and that be thankful for a glass of water 
after a while a young woman open the door and bring -PRON- out a big mug of milk 
-PRON- be half undressed as if -PRON- be go to bed when i knock and -PRON- have -PRON- hair hang and i think by -PRON- figure and by something in the look of -PRON- eye that -PRON- must be carry a child 
-PRON- keep -PRON- in talk a long while at the door and i think -PRON- strange because -PRON- breast and -PRON- shoulder be bare 
-PRON- ask -PRON- be i tired and would i like to stop the night there 
-PRON- say -PRON- be all alone in the house and that -PRON- husband have go that morning to queenstown with -PRON- sister to see -PRON- off 
and all the time -PRON- be talk stevie -PRON- have -PRON- eye fix on -PRON- face and -PRON- stand so close to -PRON- i could hear -PRON- breathing 
when i hand -PRON- back the mug at last -PRON- take -PRON- hand to draw -PRON- in over the threshold and say come in and stay the night here no call to be frighten no one in -PRON- but i didnot go in stevie 
i thank -PRON- and go on -PRON- way again all in a fever 
at the first bend of the road i look back and -PRON- be stand at the door 
the last word of story sing in -PRON- memory and the figure of the woman in the story stand forth reflect in other figure of the peasant woman whom -PRON- have see stand in the doorway at clane as the college car drive by as a type of -PRON- race and of -PRON- own a batlike soul wake to the consciousness of -PRON- in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and through the eye and voice and gesture of a woman without guile call the stranger to -PRON- bed 
a hand be lay on -PRON- arm and a young voice cry ah gentleman -PRON- own girl sir 
the first handsel today gentleman 
buy that lovely bunch 
will -PRON- gentleman 
the blue flower which -PRON- lift towards -PRON- and -PRON- young blue eye seem to -PRON- at that instant image of guilelessness and -PRON- halt till the image have vanish and -PRON- see only -PRON- ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face 
do gentleman forget -PRON- own girl sir have no money say stephen 
buy -PRON- lovely one will -PRON- sir 
only a penny 
do -PRON- hear what i say ask stephen bend towards -PRON- 
i tell -PRON- i have no money 
i tell -PRON- again now 
well sure -PRON- will some day sir please god the girl answer after an instant 
possibly say stephen but i donot think -PRON- likely 
-PRON- leave -PRON- quickly fear that -PRON- intimacy may turn to gibe and wish to be out of the way before -PRON- offer -PRON- ware to another a tourist from england or a student of trinity 
grafton street along which -PRON- walk prolong that moment of discouraged poverty 
in the roadway at the head of the street a slab be set to the memory of wolfe tone and -PRON- remember have be present with -PRON- father at -PRON- laying 
-PRON- remember with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute 
there be four french delegate in a brake and one a plump smile young man hold wedge on a stick a card on which be print the word vive but the tree in green be fragrant of rain and the rainsodden earth give forth -PRON- mortal odour a faint incense rise upward through the mould from many heart 
the soul of the gallant venal city which -PRON- elder have tell -PRON- of have shrink with time to a faint mortal odour rise from the earth and -PRON- know that in a moment when -PRON- enter the sombre college -PRON- would be conscious of a corruption other than that of buck egan and burnchapel whaley 
-PRON- be too late to go upstairs to the french class 
-PRON- cross the hall and take the corridor to the left which lead to the physics theatre 
the corridor be dark and silent but not unwatchful 
why do -PRON- feel that -PRON- be not unwatchful 
be -PRON- because -PRON- have hear that in buck time there be a secret staircase there 
or be the jesuit house extraterritorial and be -PRON- walk among alien 
the ireland of tone and of parnell seem to have recede in space 
-PRON- open the door of the theatre and halt in the chilly grey light that struggle through the dusty window 
a figure be crouch before the large grate and by -PRON- leanness and greyness -PRON- know that -PRON- be the dean of study light the fire 
stephen close the door quietly and approach the fireplace 
good morning sir 
can i help -PRON- 
the priest look up quickly and say one moment now mr dedalus and -PRON- will see 
there be an art in light a fire 
-PRON- have the liberal art and -PRON- have the useful art 
this be one of the useful art will try to learn -PRON- say stephen 
not too much coal say the dean work briskly at -PRON- task that be one of the secret 
-PRON- produce four candlebutt from the sidepocket of -PRON- soutane and place -PRON- deftly among the coal and twisted paper 
stephen watch -PRON- in silence 
kneel thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busy with the disposition of -PRON- wisps of paper and candlebutt -PRON- seem more than ever a humble server make ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple a levite of the lord 
like a levite robe of plain linen the fade worn soutane drape the kneeling figure of one whom the canonical or the bellbordered ephod would irk and trouble 
-PRON- very body have wax old in lowly service of the tend the fire upon the altar in bear tiding secretly in wait upon worldling in strike swiftly when biddenand yet have remain ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty 
nay -PRON- very soul have wax old in that service without grow towards light and beauty or spread abroad a sweet odour of -PRON- sanctitya mortify will no more responsive to the thrill of -PRON- obedience than be to the thrill of love or combat -PRON- age body spare and sinewy grey with a silverpointe down 
the dean rest back on -PRON- hunker and watch the stick catch 
stephen to fill the silence say be sure i could not light a fire 
-PRON- be an artist be -PRON- not mr dedalus say the dean glance up and blink -PRON- pale eye 
the object of the artist be the creation of the beautiful 
what the beautiful be be another question 
-PRON- rub -PRON- hand slowly and drily over the difficulty 
can -PRON- solve that question now -PRON- ask 
aquinas answer stephen say pulcra sunt qu visa placent 
this fire before -PRON- say the dean will be pleasing to the eye 
will -PRON- therefore be beautiful 
in so far as -PRON- be apprehend by the sight which i suppose mean here esthetic intellection -PRON- will be beautiful 
but aquinas also say bonum est in quod tendit appetitus 
in so far as -PRON- satisfy the animal craving for warmth fire be a good 
in hell however -PRON- be an evil 
quite so say the dean -PRON- have certainly hit the nail on the head 
-PRON- rise nimbly and go towards the door set -PRON- ajar and say draught be say to be a help in these matter 
as -PRON- come back to the hearth limp slightly but with a brisk step stephen see the silent soul of a jesuit look out at -PRON- from the pale loveless eye 
like ignatius -PRON- be lame but in -PRON- eye burn no spark of ignatius enthusiasm 
even the legendary craft of the company a craft subtler and more secret than -PRON- fabled book of secret subtle wisdom have not fire -PRON- soul with the energy of apostleship 
-PRON- seem as if -PRON- use the shift and lore and cunning of the world as bidden to do for the great glory of god without joy in -PRON- handling or hatred of that in -PRON- which be evil but turn -PRON- with a firm gesture of obedience back upon -PRON- and for all this silent service -PRON- seem as if -PRON- love not at all the master and little if at all the end -PRON- serve 
similiter atque senis baculus -PRON- be as the founder would have have -PRON- like a staff in an old man hand to be lean on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather to lie with a ladys nosegay on a garden seat to be raise in menace 
the dean return to the hearth and begin to stroke -PRON- chin 
when may -PRON- expect to have something from -PRON- on the esthetic question -PRON- ask 
from -PRON- say stephen in astonishment 
i stumble on an idea once a fortnight if i be lucky 
these question be very profound mr dedalus say the dean 
-PRON- be like look down from the cliff of moher into the depth 
many go down into the depth and never come up 
only the train diver can go down into those depth and explore -PRON- and come to the surface again 
if -PRON- mean speculation sir say stephen i also be sure that there be no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bind by -PRON- own law 
ha 
for -PRON- purpose i can work on at present by the light of one or two idea of aristotle and aquina see 
i quite see -PRON- point need -PRON- only for -PRON- own use and guidance until i have do something for -PRON- by -PRON- light 
if the lamp smoke or smell i shall try to trim -PRON- 
if -PRON- do not give light enough i shall sell -PRON- and buy another 
epictetus also have a lamp say the dean which be sell for a fancy price after -PRON- death 
-PRON- be the lamp -PRON- write -PRON- philosophical dissertation by 
-PRON- know epictetus 
an old gentleman say stephen coarsely who say that the soul be very like a bucketful of water 
-PRON- tell -PRON- in -PRON- homely way the dean go on that -PRON- put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the god and that a thief steal the lamp 
what do the philosopher do 
-PRON- reflect that -PRON- be in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp 
a smell of molten tallow come up from the dean candle butt and fuse -PRON- in consciousness with the jingle of the word bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket 
the priest voice too have a hard jingle tone mind halt by instinct check by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priest face which seem like an unlit lamp or a reflector hang in a false focus 
what lie behind -PRON- or within -PRON- 
a dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud charge with intellection and capable of the gloom of god mean a different kind of lamp sir say stephen 
undoubtedly say the dean 
one difficulty say stephen in esthetic discussion be to know whether word be be use accord to the literary tradition or accord to the tradition of the marketplace 
i remember a sentence of in which -PRON- say of the blessed virgin that -PRON- be detain in the full company of the saint 
the use of the word in the marketplace be quite different hope i be not detain -PRON- not in the least say the dean politely 
no no say stephen smile i yes i see say the dean quickly i quite catch the point detain 
-PRON- thrust forward -PRON- under jaw and utter a dry short cough 
to return to the lamp -PRON- say the feeding of -PRON- be also a nice problem 
-PRON- must choose the pure oil and -PRON- must be careful when -PRON- pour -PRON- in not to overflow -PRON- not to pour in more than the funnel can hold 
what funnel ask stephen 
the funnel through which -PRON- pour the oil into -PRON- lamp 
that say stephen 
be that call a funnel 
be -PRON- not a tundish 
what be a tundish 
that 
the the funnel 
be that call a tundish in ireland ask the dean 
i never hear the word in -PRON- life 
-PRON- be call a tundish in low drumcondra say stephen laugh where -PRON- speak the good english tundish say the dean reflectively 
that be a most interesting word 
i must look that word up 
upon -PRON- word i must 
-PRON- courtesy of manner rang a little false and stephen look at the english convert with the same eye as the eld brother in the parable may have turn on the prodigal 
a humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversion a poor englishman in ireland -PRON- seem to have enter on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity have be all but give througha latecomer a tardy spirit 
from what have -PRON- set out 
perhaps -PRON- have be bear and breed among serious dissenter see salvation in jesus only and abhor the vain pomp of the establishment 
have -PRON- feel the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of -PRON- turbulent schism six principle man peculiar people seed and snake baptist supralapsarian dogmatist 
have -PRON- find the true church all of a sudden in wind up to the end like a reel of cotton some finespun line of reason upon insufflation on the imposition of hand or the procession of the holy ghost 
or have lord christ touch -PRON- and bid -PRON- follow like that disciple who have sit at the receipt of custom as -PRON- sit by the door of some zincroofe chapel yawning and tell over -PRON- church pence 
the dean repeat the word yet again 
tundish 
well now that be interesting 
the question -PRON- ask -PRON- a moment ago seem to -PRON- more interesting 
what be that beauty which the artist struggle to express from lump of earth say stephen coldly 
the little word seem to have turn a rapier point of -PRON- sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe 
-PRON- feel with a smart of dejection that the man to whom -PRON- be speak be a countryman of ben jonson 
-PRON- think the language in which -PRON- be speak be -PRON- before -PRON- be mine 
how different be the word home christ ale master on -PRON- lip and on mine 
i can not speak or write these word without unrest of spirit 
-PRON- language so familiar and so foreign will always be for -PRON- an acquire speech 
i have not make or accept -PRON- word 
-PRON- voice hold -PRON- at bay 
-PRON- soul fret in the shadow of -PRON- language 
and to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime the dean add to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty 
and to inquire what kind of beauty be proper to each of the various art 
these be some interesting point -PRON- may take up 
stephen dishearten suddenly by the dean firm dry tone be silent and through the silence a distant noise of many boot and confused voice come up the staircase 
in pursue these speculation say the dean conclusively there be however the danger of perishing of inanition 
first -PRON- must take -PRON- degree 
set that before -PRON- as -PRON- first aim 
then little by little -PRON- will see -PRON- way 
i mean in every sense -PRON- way in life and in thinking 
-PRON- may be uphill pedal at first 
take mr moonan 
-PRON- be a long time before -PRON- get to the top 
but -PRON- get there may not have -PRON- talent say stephen quietly 
-PRON- never know say the dean brightly 
-PRON- never can say what be in -PRON- 
i most certainly should not be despondent 
per aspera ad astra -PRON- leave the hearth quickly and go towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first art class 
lean against the fireplace stephen hear -PRON- greet briskly and impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank smile of the coarse student 
a desolate pity begin to fall like dew upon -PRON- easily embittered heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly loyola for this halfbrother of the clergy more venal than -PRON- in speech more steadfast of soul than -PRON- one whom -PRON- would never call -PRON- ghostly father and -PRON- think how this man and -PRON- companion have earn the name of worldling at the hand not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for have plead during all -PRON- history at the bar of justice for the soul of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent 
the entry of the professor be signal by a few round of kentish fire from the heavy boot of those student who sit on the high tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbe window 
the calling of the roll begin and the response to the name be give out in all tone until the name of peter byrne be reach 
here 
a deep bass note in response come from the upper tier follow by cough of protest along the other bench 
the professor pause in -PRON- reading and call the next name cranly 
no answer 
mr cranly 
a smile fly across face as -PRON- think of -PRON- friend study 
try leopardstown say a voice from the bench behind 
stephen glance up quickly but snoutish face outline on the grey light be impassive 
a formula be give out 
amid the rustling of the notebook stephen turn back again and say give -PRON- some paper for sake 
be -PRON- as bad as that ask moynihan with a broad grin 
-PRON- tear a sheet from -PRON- scribbler and pass -PRON- down whisper in case of necessity any layman or woman can do -PRON- 
the formula which -PRON- write obediently on the sheet of paper the coiling and uncoiling calculation of the professor the spectrelike symbol of force and velocity fascinate and jaded mind 
-PRON- have hear some say that the old professor be an atheist freemason the grey dull day 
-PRON- seem a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which soul of mathematician may wander project long slend fabric from plane to plane of ever rare and paler twilight radiate swift eddy to the last verge of a universe ever vaster farther and more impalpable 
so -PRON- must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal 
perhaps some of -PRON- gentleman may be familiar with the work of mr gilbert 
in one of -PRON- song -PRON- speak of the billiard sharp who be condemn to play on a cloth untrue with a twisted cue and elliptical billiard ball

the student salute temple fumble as before at the peak of -PRON- cap -PRON- walk forward in silence 
as -PRON- near the alley stephen could hear the thud of the player hand and the wet smack of the ball and voice cry out excitedly at each stroke 
the three student halt round the box on which davin sit to follow the game 
temple after a few moment sidle across to stephen and say excuse -PRON- i want to ask -PRON- do -PRON- believe that jean jacque rousseau be a sincere man 
stephen laugh outright 
cranly pick up the break stave of a cask from the grass at -PRON- foot turn swiftly and say sternly temple i declare to the live god if -PRON- say another word do -PRON- know to anybody on any subject kill -PRON- super spottum -PRON- be like -PRON- i fancy say stephen an emotional man

-PRON- phrase be greet by a strange laugh from a student who lounge against the wall -PRON- peaked cap down on -PRON- eye 
the laugh pitch in a high key and come from a so muscular frame seem like the whinny of an elephant 
the student body shake all over and to ease -PRON- mirth -PRON- rub both -PRON- hand delightedly over -PRON- groin 
lynch be awake say cranly 
lynch for answer straighten -PRON- and thrust forward -PRON- chest 
lynch put out -PRON- chest say stephen as a criticism of life 
lynch smote -PRON- sonorously on the chest and say who have anything to say about -PRON- girth 
cranly take -PRON- at the word and the two begin to tussle 
when -PRON- face have flush with the struggle -PRON- draw apart pant 
stephen bend down towards davin who intent on the game have pay no heed to the talk of the other

what with -PRON- name and -PRON- idea be -PRON- irish at all 
come with -PRON- now to the office of arm and i will show -PRON- the tree of -PRON- family say stephen 
then be one of -PRON- say davin 
why donot -PRON- learn irish 
why do -PRON- drop out of the league class after the first lesson 
-PRON- know one reason why answer stephen 
davin toss -PRON- head and laugh 
oh come now -PRON- say 
be -PRON- on account of that certain young lady and father moran 
but that s all in -PRON- own mind stevie 
-PRON- be only talk and laugh 
stephen pause and lay a friendly hand upon shoulder 
do -PRON- remember -PRON- say when -PRON- know each other first 
the first morning -PRON- meet -PRON- ask -PRON- to show -PRON- the way to the matriculation class put a very strong stress on the first syllable 
-PRON- remember 
then -PRON- use to address the jesuit as father -PRON- remember 
i ask -PRON- about -PRON- be -PRON- as innocent as -PRON- speech a simple person say davin 
-PRON- know that 
when -PRON- tell -PRON- that night in harcourt street those thing about -PRON- private life honest to god stevie i be not able to eat -PRON- dinner 
i be quite bad 
i be awake a long time that night 
why do -PRON- tell -PRON- those thing 
thank say stephen 
-PRON- mean i be a monster 
no say davin 
but i wish -PRON- have not tell -PRON- 
a tide begin to surge beneath the calm surface of friendliness 
this race and this country and this life produce -PRON- -PRON- say 
i shall express -PRON- as i be 
try to be one of -PRON- repeat davin 
in heart -PRON- be an irishman but -PRON- pride be too powerful 
-PRON- ancestor throw off -PRON- language and take another stephen say 
-PRON- allow a handful of foreigner to subject -PRON- 
do -PRON- fancy i be go to pay in -PRON- own life and person debt -PRON- make 
what for 
for -PRON- freedom say davin 
no honourable and sincere man say stephen have give up to -PRON- -PRON- life and -PRON- youth and -PRON- affection from the day of tone to those of parnell but -PRON- sell -PRON- to the enemy or fail -PRON- in need or revile -PRON- and leave -PRON- for another 
and -PRON- invite -PRON- to be one of -PRON- see -PRON- damn first 
-PRON- die for -PRON- ideal stevie say davin 
-PRON- day will come yet believe -PRON- 
stephen follow -PRON- own thought be silent for an instant 
the soul be bear -PRON- say vaguely first in those moment i tell -PRON- of 
-PRON- have a slow and dark birth more mysterious than the birth of the body 
when the soul of a man be bear in this country there be net fling at -PRON- to hold -PRON- back from flight 
-PRON- talk to -PRON- of nationality language religion 
i shall try to fly by those net 
davin knock the ashe from -PRON- pipe 
too deep for -PRON- stevie -PRON- say 
but a man country come first 
ireland first stevie 
-PRON- can be a poet or a mystic after 
do -PRON- know what ireland be ask stephen with cold violence 
ireland be the old sow that eat -PRON- farrow 
davin rise from -PRON- box and go towards the player shake -PRON- head sadly 
but in a moment -PRON- sadness leave -PRON- and -PRON- be hotly dispute with cranly and the two player who have finish -PRON- game 
a match of four be arrange cranly insist however that -PRON- ball should be use 
-PRON- let -PRON- rebound twice or thrice to -PRON- hand and strike -PRON- strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley exclaim in answer to -PRON- thud -PRON- soul 
stephen stand with lynch till the score begin to rise 
then -PRON- pluck -PRON- by the sleeve to come away 
lynch obey say let -PRON- eke go as cranly have -PRON- 
stephen smile at this sidethrust 
-PRON- pass back through the garden and out through the hall where the dodder porter be pin up a hall notice in the frame 
at the foot of the step -PRON- halt and stephen take a packet of cigarette from -PRON- pocket and offer -PRON- to -PRON- companion know -PRON- be poor -PRON- say 
damn -PRON- yellow insolence answer lynch 
this second proof of culture make stephen smile again 
-PRON- be a great day for european culture -PRON- say when -PRON- make up -PRON- mind to swear in yellow 
-PRON- light -PRON- cigarette and turn to the right 
after a pause stephen begin aristotle have not define pity and terror 
i have 
i say 
lynch halt and say bluntly stop 
i wonot listen 
i be sick 
i be out last night on a yellow drunk with horan and goggin 
stephen go on pity be the feeling which arrest the mind in the presence of whatsoever be grave and constant in human suffering and unite -PRON- with the human sufferer 
terror be the feeling which arrest the mind in the presence of whatsoever be grave and constant in human suffering and unite -PRON- with the secret cause 
repeat say lynch 
stephen repeat the definition slowly girl get into a hansom a few day ago -PRON- go on in london 
-PRON- be on -PRON- way to meet -PRON- mother whom -PRON- have not see for many year 
at the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shiver the window of the hansom in the shape of a star 
a long fine needle of the shiver glass pierce -PRON- heart 
-PRON- die on the instant 
the reporter call -PRON- a tragic death 
-PRON- be not 
-PRON- be remote from terror and pity accord to the term of -PRON- definition 
the tragic emotion in fact be a face look two way towards terror and towards pity both of which be phase of -PRON- 
-PRON- see i use the word arrest 
i mean that the tragic emotion be static 
or rather the dramatic emotion be 
the feeling excite by improper art be kinetic desire or loathing 
desire urge -PRON- to possess to go to something loathing urge -PRON- to abandon to go from something 
the art which excite -PRON- pornographical or didactic be therefore improper art 
the esthetic emotion use the general term be therefore static 
the mind be arrest and raise above desire and loathing 
-PRON- say that art must not excite desire say lynch 
i tell -PRON- that one day i write -PRON- name in pencil on the backside of the venus of praxitele in the museum 
be that not desire speak of normal nature say stephen 
-PRON- also tell -PRON- that when -PRON- be a boy in that charm carmelite school -PRON- eat piece of dry cowdung 
lynch break again into a whinny of laughter and again rub both -PRON- hand over -PRON- groin but without take -PRON- from -PRON- pocket 
i do 
i do -PRON- cry 
stephen turn towards -PRON- companion and look at -PRON- for a moment boldly in the eye 
lynch recover from -PRON- laughter answer -PRON- look from -PRON- humble eye 
the long slender flatten skull beneath the long pointed cap bring before mind the image of a hooded reptile 
the eye too be reptilelike in glint and gaze 
yet at that instant humble and alert in -PRON- look -PRON- be light by one tiny human point the window of a shrivelled soul poignant and selfembittere 
as for that stephen say in polite parenthesis -PRON- be all animal 
i also be an animal 
-PRON- be say lynch 
but -PRON- be just now in a mental world stephen continue 
the desire and loathing excite by improper esthetic mean be really not esthetic emotion not only because -PRON- be kinetic in character but also because -PRON- be not more than physical 
-PRON- flesh shrink from what -PRON- dread and respond to the stimulus of what -PRON- desire by a purely reflex action of the nervous system 
-PRON- eyelid close before -PRON- be aware that the fly be about to enter -PRON- eye 
not always say lynch critically 
in the same way say stephen -PRON- flesh respond to the stimulus of a naked statue but -PRON- be i say simply a reflex action of the nerve 
beauty express by the artist can not awaken in -PRON- an emotion which be kinetic or a sensation which be purely physical 
-PRON- awaken or ought to awaken or induce or ought to induce an esthetic stasis an ideal pity or an ideal terror a stasis call forth prolong and at last dissolve by what i call the rhythm of beauty 
what be that exactly ask lynch 
rhythm say stephen be the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to -PRON- part or part or of any part to the esthetic whole of which -PRON- be a part 
if that be rhythm say lynch let -PRON- hear what -PRON- call beauty and please remember though i do eat a cake of cowdung once that i admire only beauty 
stephen raise -PRON- cap as if in greeting 
then blush slightly -PRON- lay -PRON- hand on thick tweed sleeve 
-PRON- be right -PRON- say and the other be wrong 
to speak of these thing and to try to understand -PRON- nature and have understand -PRON- to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express to press out again from the gross earth or what -PRON- bring forth from sound and shape and colour which be the prison gate of -PRON- soul an image of the beauty -PRON- have come to understandthat be art -PRON- have reach the canal bridge and turn from -PRON- course go on by the tree 
a crude grey light mirror in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branch over -PRON- head seem to war against the course of thought 
but -PRON- have not answer -PRON- question say lynch 
what be art 
what be the beauty -PRON- express 
that be the first definition i give -PRON- -PRON- sleepyheade wretch say stephen when i begin to try to think out the matter for -PRON- 
do -PRON- remember the night 
cranly lose -PRON- temper and begin to talk about wicklow bacon remember say lynch 
-PRON- tell -PRON- about -PRON- flame fat devil of pig 
art say stephen be the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end 
-PRON- remember the pig and forget that 
-PRON- be a distress pair -PRON- and cranly 
lynch make a grimace at the raw grey sky and say if i be to listen to -PRON- esthetic philosophy give -PRON- at least another cigarette 
i donot care about -PRON- 
i donot even care about woman 
damn -PRON- and damn everything 
i want a job of five hundred a year 
-PRON- canot get -PRON- one 
stephen hand -PRON- the packet of cigarette 
lynch take the last one that remain say simply proceed 
aquinas say stephen say that be beautiful the apprehension of which please 
lynch nod remember that -PRON- say pulcra sunt qu visa placent -PRON- use the word visa say stephen to cover esthetic apprehension of all kind whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension 
this word though -PRON- be vague be clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing 
-PRON- mean certainly a stasis and not a kinesis 
how about the true 
-PRON- produce also a stasis of the mind 
-PRON- would not write -PRON- name in pencil across the hypothenuse of a rightangle triangle 
no say lynch give -PRON- the hypothenuse of the venus of praxitele 
static therefore say stephen 
plato i believe say that beauty be the splendour of truth 
i donot think that -PRON- have a meaning but the true and the beautiful be akin 
truth be behold by the intellect which be appease by the most satisfying relation of the intelligible beauty be behold by the imagination which be appease by the most satisfying relation of the sensible 
the first step in the direction of truth be to understand the frame and scope of the intellect -PRON- to comprehend the act -PRON- of intellection entire system of philosophy rest upon -PRON- book of psychology and that i think rest on -PRON- statement that the same attribute can not at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject 
the first step in the direction of beauty be to understand the frame and scope of the imagination to comprehend the act -PRON- of esthetic apprehension 
be that clear 
but what be beauty ask lynch impatiently 
out with another definition 
something -PRON- see and like 
be that the good -PRON- and aquinas can do 
let -PRON- take woman say stephen 
let -PRON- take -PRON- say lynch fervently 
the greek the turk the chinese the copt the hottentot say stephen all admire a different type of female beauty 
that seem to be a maze out of which -PRON- can not escape 
i see however two way out 
one be this hypothesis that every physical quality admire by man in woman be in direct connexion with the manifold function of woman for the propagation of the specie 
-PRON- may be so 
the world -PRON- seem be dreary than even -PRON- lynch imagine 
for -PRON- part i dislike that way out 
-PRON- lead to eugenic rather than to esthetic 
-PRON- lead -PRON- out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where with one hand on the origin of specie and the other hand on the new testament tell -PRON- that -PRON- admire the great flank of venus because -PRON- feel that -PRON- would bear -PRON- burly offspre and admire -PRON- great breast because -PRON- feel that -PRON- would give good milk to -PRON- child and your 
then be a sulphuryellow liar say lynch energetically 
there remain another way out say stephen laugh 
to wit say lynch 
this hypothesis stephen begin 
a long dray laden with old iron come round the corner of sir patrick hospital cover the end of speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattle metal 
lynch close -PRON- ear and give out oath after oath till the dray have pass 
then -PRON- turn on -PRON- heel rudely 
stephen turn also and wait for a few moment till -PRON- companion illhumour have have -PRON- vent 
this hypothesis stephen repeat be the other way out that though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people all people who admire a beautiful object find in -PRON- certain relation which satisfy and coincide with the stage -PRON- of all esthetic apprehension 
these relation of the sensible visible to -PRON- through one form and to -PRON- through another must be therefore the necessary quality of beauty 
now -PRON- can return to -PRON- old friend saint thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom 
lynch laugh 
-PRON- amuse -PRON- vastly -PRON- say to hear -PRON- quote -PRON- time after time like a jolly round friar 
be -PRON- laugh in -PRON- sleeve answer stephen would call -PRON- esthetic theory apply aquina 
so far as this side of esthetic philosophy extend aquina will carry -PRON- all along the line 
when -PRON- come to the phenomenon of artistic conception artistic gestation and artistic reproduction i require a new terminology and a new personal experience 
of course say lynch 
after all aquina in spite of -PRON- intellect be exactly a good round friar 
but -PRON- will tell -PRON- about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day 
hurry up and finish the first part 
who know say stephen smile 
perhaps aquina would understand -PRON- better than -PRON- 
-PRON- be a poet -PRON- 
-PRON- write a hymn for maundy thursday 
-PRON- begin with the word pange lingua gloriosi -PRON- say -PRON- be the high glory of the hymnal 
-PRON- be an intricate and soothing hymn 
i like -PRON- but there be no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song the vexilla regis of venantius fortunatus 
lynch begin to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice inpleta sunt qu concinit david fideli carmine dicendo nationibus regnavit a ligno deus great -PRON- say well pleased 
great music 
-PRON- turn into low mount street 
a few step from the corner a fat young man wear a silk neckcloth salute -PRON- and stop 
do -PRON- hear the result of the exam -PRON- ask 
griffin be pluck 
halpin and oflynn be through the home civil 
moonan get fifth place in the indian 
oshaughnessy get fourteenth 
the irish fellow in give -PRON- a feed last night 
-PRON- all eat curry 
-PRON- pallid bloated face express benevolent malice and as -PRON- have advance through -PRON- tiding of success -PRON- small fatencircled eye vanish out of sight and -PRON- weak wheezing voice out of hearing 
in reply to a question of -PRON- eye and -PRON- voice come forth again from -PRON- lurkingplace 
yes and -PRON- say take pure mathematic and take constitutional history 
there be twenty subject take botany too 
-PRON- know a member of the field club 
-PRON- draw back from the other two in a stately fashion and place a plump woollenglove hand on -PRON- breast from which mutter wheeze laughter at once break forth 
bring -PRON- a few turnip and onion the next time -PRON- go out say stephen drily to make a stew 
the fat student laugh indulgently and say -PRON- be all highly respectable people in the field club 
last saturday -PRON- go out to glenmalure seven of -PRON- 
with woman donovan say lynch 
donovan again lay -PRON- hand on -PRON- chest and say -PRON- end be the acquisition of knowledge 
then -PRON- say quickly hear -PRON- be write some essay about esthetic 
stephen make a vague gesture of denial 
goethe and lessing say donovan have write a lot on that subject the classical school and the romantic school and all that 
the laocoon interest -PRON- very much when i read -PRON- 
of course -PRON- be idealistic german ultraprofound 
neither of the other speak 
donovan take leave of -PRON- urbanely must go -PRON- say softly and benevolently i have a strong suspicion amount almost to a conviction that -PRON- sister intend to make pancake today for the dinner of the donovan family 
goodbye stephen say in -PRON- wake forget the turnip for -PRON- and -PRON- mate 
lynch gaze after -PRON- -PRON- lip curl in slow scorn till -PRON- face resemble a devil mask to think that that yellow pancakeeate excrement can get a good job -PRON- say at length and i have to smoke cheap cigarette 
-PRON- turn -PRON- face towards merrion square and go for a little in silence 
to finish what i be say about beauty say stephen the most satisfying relation of the sensible must therefore correspond to the necessary phase of artistic apprehension 
find these and -PRON- find the quality of universal beauty 
aquinas say ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur integrita consonantia clarita i translate -PRON- so three thing be need for beauty wholeness harmony and radiance do these correspond to the phase of apprehension 
be -PRON- follow 
of course i be say lynch 
if -PRON- think i have an excrementitious intelligence run after donovan and ask -PRON- to listen to -PRON- 
stephen point to a basket which a butcher boy have sling invert on -PRON- head 
look at that basket -PRON- say see -PRON- say lynch 
in order to see that basket say stephen -PRON- mind first of all separate the basket from the rest of the visible universe which be not the basket 
the first phase of apprehension be a bound line draw about the object to be apprehend 
an esthetic image be present to -PRON- either in space or in time 
what be audible be present in time what be visible be present in space 
but temporal or spatial the esthetic image be first luminously apprehend as selfbounde and selfcontaine upon the immeasurable background of space or time which be not -PRON- 
-PRON- apprehend -PRON- as one thing 
-PRON- see -PRON- as one whole 
-PRON- apprehend -PRON- wholeness 
that be integrita eye say lynch laugh 
go on 
then say stephen -PRON- pass from point to point lead by -PRON- formal line -PRON- apprehend -PRON- as balanced part against part within -PRON- limit -PRON- feel the rhythm of -PRON- structure 
in other word the synthesis of immediate perception be follow by the analysis of apprehension 
have first feel that -PRON- be one thing -PRON- feel now that -PRON- be a thing 
-PRON- apprehend -PRON- as complex multiple divisible separable make up of -PRON- part the result of -PRON- part and -PRON- sum harmonious 
that be consonantia eye again say lynch wittily 
tell -PRON- now what be clarita and -PRON- win the cigar 
the connotation of the word stephen say be rather vague 
aquinas use a term which seem to be inexact 
-PRON- baffle -PRON- for a long time 
-PRON- would lead -PRON- to believe that -PRON- have in mind symbolism or idealism the supreme quality of beauty be a light from some other world the idea of which the matter be but the shadow the reality of which -PRON- be but the symbol 
i think -PRON- may mean that clarita be the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one make -PRON- outshine -PRON- proper condition 
but that be literary talk 
i understand -PRON- so 
when -PRON- have apprehend that basket as one thing and have then analyse -PRON- accord to -PRON- form and apprehend -PRON- as a thing -PRON- make the only synthesis which be logically and esthetically permissible 
-PRON- see that -PRON- be that thing which -PRON- be and no other thing 
the radiance of which -PRON- speak in the scholastic quidditas the whatness of a thing 
this supreme quality be feel by the artist when the esthetic image be first conceive in -PRON- imagination 
the mind in that mysterious instant shelley liken beautifully to a fade coal 
the instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty the clear radiance of the esthetic image be apprehend luminously by the mind which have be arrest by -PRON- wholeness and fascinate by -PRON- harmony be the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the italian physiologist luigi galvani use a phrase almost as beautiful as call the enchantment of the heart 
stephen pause and though -PRON- companion do not speak feel that -PRON- word have call up around -PRON- a thoughtenchante silence 
what i have say -PRON- begin again refer to beauty in the wide sense of the word in the sense which the word have in the literary tradition 
in the marketplace -PRON- have another sense 
when -PRON- speak of beauty in the second sense of the term -PRON- judgement be influence in the first place by the art -PRON- and by the form of that art 
the image -PRON- be clear must be set between the mind or sense of the artist -PRON- and the mind or sense of other 
if -PRON- bear this in memory -PRON- will see that art necessarily divide -PRON- into three form progress from one to the next 
these form be the lyrical form the form wherein the artist present -PRON- image in immediate relation to -PRON- the epical form the form wherein -PRON- present -PRON- image in mediate relation to -PRON- and to other the dramatic form the form wherein -PRON- present -PRON- image in immediate relation to other 
that -PRON- tell -PRON- a few night ago say lynch and -PRON- begin the famous discussion have a book at home say stephen in which i have write down question which be more amusing than your be 
in find the answer to -PRON- i find the theory of esthetic which i be try to explain 
here be some question i set -PRON- be a chair finely make tragic or comic 
be the portrait of mona lisa good if i desire to see -PRON- 
be the bust of sir philip crampton lyrical epical or dramatic 
if not why not why not indeed say lynch laughing 
if a man hack in fury at a block of wood stephen continue make there an image of a cow be that image a work of art if not why not a lovely one say lynch laugh again 
that have the true scholastic stink 
lessing say stephen should not have take a group of statue to write of 
the art be inferior do not present the form i speak of distinguished clearly one from another 
even in literature the high and most spiritual art the form be often confused 
the lyrical form be in fact the simple verbal vesture of an instant of emotion a rhythmical cry such as age ago cheer on the man who pull at the oar or drag stone up a slope 
-PRON- who utter -PRON- be more conscious of the instant of emotion than of -PRON- as feel emotion 
the simple epical form be see emerge out of lyrical literature when the artist prolong and brood upon -PRON- as the centre of an epical event and this form progress till the centre of emotional gravity be equidistant from the artist -PRON- and from other 
the narrative be no longer purely personal 
the personality of the artist pass into the narration -PRON- flow round and round the person and the action like a vital sea 
this progress -PRON- will see easily in that old english ballad turpin hero which begin in the first person and end in the third person 
the dramatic form be reach when the vitality which have flow and eddy round each person fill every person with such vital force that -PRON- or -PRON- assume a proper and intangible esthetic life 
the personality of the artist at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative finally refine -PRON- out of existence impersonalize -PRON- so to speak 
the esthetic image in the dramatic form be life purify in and reprojecte from the human imagination 
the mystery of esthetic like that of material creation be accomplish 
the artist like the god of creation remain within or behind or beyond or above -PRON- handiwork invisible refine out of existence indifferent pare -PRON- fingernail 
try to refine -PRON- also out of existence say lynch 
a fine rain begin to fall from the high veiled sky and -PRON- turn into the duke lawn to reach the national library before the shower come 
what do -PRON- mean lynch ask surlily by prate about beauty and the imagination in this miserable godforsaken island 
no wonder the artist retire within or behind -PRON- handiwork after have perpetrate this country 
the rain fall faster 
when -PRON- pass through the passage beside kildare house -PRON- find many student shelter under the arcade of the library 
cranly lean against a pillar be pick -PRON- tooth with a sharpen match listen to some companion 
some girl stand near the entrance door 
lynch whisper to stephen -PRON- beloved be here 
stephen take -PRON- place silently on the step below the group of student heedless of the rain which fall fast turn -PRON- eye towards -PRON- from time to time 
-PRON- too stand silently among -PRON- companion 
-PRON- have no priest to flirt with -PRON- think with conscious bitterness remember how -PRON- have see -PRON- last 
lynch be right 
-PRON- mind empty of theory and courage lapse back into a listless peace 
-PRON- hear the student talk among -PRON- 
-PRON- speak of two friend who have pass the final medical examination of the chance of get place on ocean liner of poor and rich practice all a bubble 
an irish country practice be well 
hyne be two year in liverpool and -PRON- say the same 
a frightful hole -PRON- say -PRON- be 
nothing but midwifery case 
do -PRON- mean to say -PRON- be well to have a job here in the country than in a rich city like that 
i know a fellow 
hyne have no brain 
-PRON- get through by stew pure stew mind -PRON- plenty of money to be make in a big commercial city 
depend on the practice 
ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox simpliciter sanguinarius atrox in liverpoolio -PRON- voice reach -PRON- ear as if from a distance in interrupt pulsation 
-PRON- be prepare to go away with -PRON- companion 
the quick light shower have draw off tarry in cluster of diamond among the shrub of the quadrangle where an exhalation be breathe forth by the blacken earth 
-PRON- trim boot prattle as -PRON- stand on the step of the colonnade talk quietly and gaily glance at the cloud hold -PRON- umbrella at cunne angle against the few last raindrop close -PRON- again hold -PRON- skirt demurely 
and if -PRON- have judge -PRON- harshly 
if -PRON- life be a simple rosary of hour -PRON- life simple and strange as a birds life gay in the morning restless all day tired at sundown 
-PRON- heart simple and wilful as a birds heart 
towards dawn -PRON- awake what sweet music 
-PRON- soul be all dewy wet 
over -PRON- limb in sleep pale cool wave of light have pass 
-PRON- lie still as if -PRON- soul lie amid cool water conscious of faint sweet music 
-PRON- mind be wake slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge a morning inspiration 
a spirit fill -PRON- pure as the pure water sweet as dew move as music 
but how faintly -PRON- be inbreathe how passionlessly as if the seraphim -PRON- be breathe upon -PRON- 
-PRON- soul be wake slowly fear to awake wholly 
-PRON- be that windless hour of dawn when madness wake and strange plant open to the light and the moth fly forth silently 
an enchantment of the heart 
the night have be enchant 
in a dream or vision -PRON- have know the ecstasy of seraphic life 
be -PRON- an instant of enchantment only or long hour and year and age 
the instant of inspiration seem now to be reflect from all side at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of what have happen or of what may have happen 
the instant flash forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confuse form be veil softly -PRON- afterglow 
in the virgin womb of the imagination the word be make flesh 
gabriel the seraph have come to the virgin chamber 
an afterglow deepen within -PRON- spirit whence the white flame have pass deepening to a rose and ardent light 
that rise and ardent light be -PRON- strange wilful heart strange that no man have know or would know wilful from before the beginning of the world and lure by that ardent roselike glow the choir of the seraphim be fall from heaven 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way lure of the fall seraphim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
the verse pass from -PRON- mind to -PRON- lip and murmur -PRON- over -PRON- feel the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through -PRON- 
the roselike glow send forth -PRON- ray of rhyme way day blaze praise raise 
-PRON- ray burn up the world consume the heart of man and angel the ray from the rose that be -PRON- wilful heart 
-PRON- eye have set man heart ablaze and -PRON- have have -PRON- will of -PRON- 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
and then 
the rhythm die away cease begin again to move and beat 
and then 
smoke incense ascend from the altar of the world 
above the flame the smoke of praise go up from ocean rim to rim tell no more of enchanted day 
smoke go up from the whole earth from the vapoury ocean smoke of -PRON- praise 
the earth be like a swinge swaying censer a ball of incense an ellipsoidal ball 
the rhythm die out at once the cry of -PRON- heart be break 
-PRON- lip begin to murmur the first verse over and over then go on stumble through half verse stammer and baffle then stop 
the heart cry be break 
the veiled windless hour have pass and behind the pane of the naked window the morning light be gather 
a bell beat faintly very far away 
a bird twitter two bird three 
the bell and the bird cease and the dull white light spread -PRON- east and west cover the world cover the roselight in -PRON- heart 
fear to lose all -PRON- raise -PRON- suddenly on -PRON- elbow to look for paper and pencil 
there be neither on the table only the soup plate -PRON- have eat the rice from for supper and the candlestick with -PRON- tendril of tallow and -PRON- paper socket singe by the last flame 
-PRON- stretch -PRON- arm wearily towards the foot of the bed grope with -PRON- hand in the pocket of the coat that hang there 
-PRON- finger find a pencil and then a cigarette packet 
-PRON- lie back and tear open the packet place the last cigarette on the window ledge and begin to write out the stanza of the villanelle in small neat letter on the rough cardboard surface 
have write -PRON- out -PRON- lie back on the lumpy pillow murmur -PRON- again 
the lump of knot flock under -PRON- head remind -PRON- of the lump of knot horsehair in the sofa of -PRON- parlour on which -PRON- use to sit smile or serious ask -PRON- why -PRON- have come displeased with -PRON- and with -PRON- confound by the print of the sacred heart above the untenanted sideboard 
-PRON- see -PRON- approach -PRON- in a lull of the talk and beg -PRON- to sing one of -PRON- curious song 
then -PRON- see -PRON- sit at the old piano strike chord softly from -PRON- speckled key and singing amid the talk which have rise again in the room to -PRON- who lean beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the elizabethan a sad and sweet loth to depart the victory chant of agincourt the happy air of greensleeve 
while -PRON- sing and -PRON- listen or feign to listen -PRON- heart be at rest but when the quaint old song have end and -PRON- hear again the voice in the room -PRON- remember -PRON- own sarcasm the house where young man be call by -PRON- christian name a little too soon 
at certain instant -PRON- eye seem about to trust -PRON- but -PRON- have wait in vain 
-PRON- pass now dance lightly across -PRON- memory as -PRON- have be that night at the carnival ball -PRON- white dress a little lift a white spray nodding in -PRON- hair 
-PRON- dance lightly in the round 
-PRON- be dance towards -PRON- and as -PRON- come -PRON- eye be a little averted and a faint glow be on -PRON- cheek 
at the pause in the chain of hand -PRON- hand have lie in -PRON- an instant a soft merchandise 
-PRON- be a great stranger now 
yes 
i be bear to be a monk be afraid -PRON- be a heretic 
be -PRON- much afraid 
for answer -PRON- have dance away from -PRON- along the chain of hand dance lightly and discreetly give -PRON- to none 
the white spray nod to -PRON- dancing and when -PRON- be in shadow the glow be deep on -PRON- cheek 
a monk 
-PRON- own image start forth a profaner of the cloister a heretic franciscan willing and willing not to serve spin like gherardino da borgo san donnino a lithe web of sophistry and whisper in -PRON- ear 
no -PRON- be not -PRON- image 
-PRON- be like the image of the young priest in whose company -PRON- have see -PRON- last look at -PRON- out of dove eye toy with the page of -PRON- irish phrasebook 
yes yes the lady be come round to -PRON- 
i can see -PRON- every day 
the lady be with -PRON- 
the good helper the language have 
and the church father moran 
the church too 
come round too 
the work be go ahead there too fret about the church 
bah -PRON- have do well to leave the room in disdain 
-PRON- have do well not to salute -PRON- on the step of the library 
-PRON- have do well to leave -PRON- to flirt with -PRON- priest to toy with a church which be the scullerymaid of christendom 
rude brutal anger route the last linger instant of ecstasy from -PRON- soul 
-PRON- break up violently -PRON- fair image and fling the fragment on all side 
on all side distort reflection of -PRON- image start from -PRON- memory the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden face who have call -PRON- -PRON- own girl and beg -PRON- handsel the kitchengirl in the next house who sing over the clatter of -PRON- plate with the drawl of a country singer the first bar of by lake and fell a girl who have laugh gaily to see -PRON- stumble when the iron grate in the footpath near cork hill have catch the break sole of -PRON- shoe a girl -PRON- have glance at attract by -PRON- small ripe mouth as -PRON- pass out of biscuit factory who have cry to -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder do -PRON- like what -PRON- see of -PRON- straight hair and curly eyebrow 
and yet -PRON- feel that however -PRON- may revile and mock -PRON- image -PRON- anger be also a form of homage 
-PRON- have leave the classroom in disdain that be not wholly sincere feeling that perhaps the secret of -PRON- race lie behind those dark eye upon which -PRON- long lash fling a quick shadow 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- bitterly as -PRON- walk through the street that -PRON- be a figure of the womanhood of -PRON- country a batlike soul wake to the consciousness of -PRON- in darkness and secrecy and loneliness tarry awhile loveless and sinless with -PRON- mild lover and leave -PRON- to whisper of innocent transgression in the latticed ear of a priest 
-PRON- anger against -PRON- find vent in coarse rail at -PRON- paramour whose name and voice and feature offend -PRON- baffle pride a priested peasant with a brother a policeman in dublin and a brother a potboy in moycullen 
to -PRON- -PRON- would unveil -PRON- soul shy nakedness to one who be but school in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to -PRON- a priest of the eternal imagination transmute the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everlive life 
the radiant image of the eucharist unite again in an instant -PRON- bitter and despair thought -PRON- cry arise unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving 
-PRON- broken cry and mournful lay rise in one eucharistic hymn be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
while sacrifice hand upraise the chalice flow to the brim tell no more of enchanted day 
-PRON- speak the verse aloud from the first line till the music and rhythm suffuse -PRON- mind turn -PRON- to quiet indulgence then copy -PRON- painfully to feel -PRON- the well by see -PRON- then lie back on -PRON- bolster 
the full morning light have come 
no sound be to be hear but -PRON- know that all around -PRON- life be about to awaken in common noise hoarse voice sleepy prayer 
shrink from that life -PRON- turn towards the wall make a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flower of the tattered wallpaper 
-PRON- try to warm -PRON- perishing joy in -PRON- scarlet glow imagine a roseway from where -PRON- lie upwards to heaven all strew with scarlet flower 
weary 
weary 
-PRON- too be weary of ardent way 
a gradual warmth a languorous weariness pass over -PRON- descend along -PRON- spine from -PRON- closely cowl head 
-PRON- feel -PRON- descend and see -PRON- as -PRON- lie smile 
soon -PRON- would sleep 
-PRON- have write verse for -PRON- again after ten year 
ten year before -PRON- have wear -PRON- shawl cowlwise about -PRON- head send spray of -PRON- warm breath into the night air tap -PRON- foot upon the glassy road 
-PRON- be the last tram the lank brown horse know -PRON- and shake -PRON- bell to the clear night in admonition 
the conductor talk with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp 
-PRON- stand on the step of the tram -PRON- on the upper -PRON- on the low 
-PRON- come up to -PRON- step many time between -PRON- phrase and go down again and once or twice remain beside -PRON- forget to go down and then go down 
let be 
let be 
ten year from that wisdom of child to -PRON- folly 
if -PRON- send -PRON- the verse 
-PRON- would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of eggshell 
folly indeed 
-PRON- brother would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with -PRON- strong hard finger 
the suave priest -PRON- uncle seat in -PRON- armchair would hold the page at arm length read -PRON- smile and approve of the literary form 
no no that be folly 
even if -PRON- send -PRON- the verse -PRON- would not show -PRON- to other 
no no -PRON- could not 
-PRON- begin to feel that -PRON- have wrong -PRON- 
a sense of -PRON- innocence move -PRON- almost to pity -PRON- an innocence -PRON- have never understand till -PRON- have come to the knowledge of -PRON- through sin an innocence which -PRON- too have not understand while -PRON- be innocent or before the strange humiliation of -PRON- nature have first come upon -PRON- 
then first -PRON- soul have begin to live as -PRON- soul have when -PRON- have first sin and a tender compassion fill -PRON- heart as -PRON- remember -PRON- frail pallor and -PRON- eye humble and sadden by the dark shame of womanhood 
while -PRON- soul have pass from ecstasy to languor where have -PRON- be 
may -PRON- be in the mysterious way of spiritual life that -PRON- soul at those same moment have be conscious of -PRON- homage 
-PRON- may be 
a glow of desire kindle again -PRON- soul and fire and fulfil all -PRON- body 
conscious of -PRON- desire -PRON- be wake from odorous sleep the temptress of -PRON- villanelle 
-PRON- eye dark and with a look of languor be open to -PRON- eye 
-PRON- nakedness yield to -PRON- radiant warm odorous and lavishlimbed enfold -PRON- like a shine cloud enfold -PRON- like water with a liquid life and like a cloud of vapour or like water circumfluent in space the liquid letter of speech symbol of the element of mystery flow forth over -PRON- brain 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way lure of the fall seraphim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
-PRON- eye have set man heart ablaze and -PRON- have have -PRON- will of -PRON- 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
above the flame the smoke of praise go up from ocean rim to rim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
-PRON- broken cry and mournful lay rise in one eucharistic hymn 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
while sacrifice hand upraise the chalice flow to the brim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
and still -PRON- hold -PRON- longing gaze with languorous look and lavish limb 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
tell no more of enchanted day 
what bird be -PRON- 
-PRON- stand on the step of the library to look at -PRON- lean wearily on -PRON- ashplant 
-PRON- fly round and round the jut shoulder of a house in molesworth street 
the air of the late march evening make clear -PRON- flight -PRON- dark darting quivering body fly clearly against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue 
-PRON- watch -PRON- flight bird after bird a dark flash a swerve a flutter of wing 
-PRON- try to count -PRON- before all -PRON- dart quivering body pass six ten eleven and wonder be -PRON- odd or even in number 
twelve thirteen for two come wheel down from the upper sky 
-PRON- be fly high and low but ever round and round in straight and curve line and ever fly from leave to right circle about a temple of air 
-PRON- listen to the cry like the squeak of mouse behind the wainscot a shrill twofold note 
but the note be long and shrill and whir unlike the cry of vermin fall a third or a fourth and trill as the fly beak clove the air 
-PRON- cry be shrill and clear and fine and fall like thread of silken light unwound from whir spools 
the inhuman clamour soothe -PRON- ear in which -PRON- mother sob and reproach murmur insistently and the dark frail quiver body wheel and fluttering and swerve round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothe -PRON- eye which still see the image of -PRON- mother face 
why be -PRON- gaze upwards from the step of the porch hear -PRON- shrill twofold cry watch -PRON- flight 
for an augury of good or evil

what be -PRON- 
cranly ask after a pause 
stephen begin to enumerate glibly -PRON- father attribute medical student an oarsman a tenor an amateur actor a shouting politician a small landlord a small investor a drinker a good fellow a storyteller somebodys secretary something in a distillery a taxgatherer a bankrupt and at present a praiser of -PRON- own past 
cranly laugh tighten -PRON- grip on arm and say the distillery be damn good 
be there anything else -PRON- want to know 
stephen ask 
be -PRON- in good circumstance at present 
do i look -PRON- 
stephen ask bluntly 
so then cranly go on musingly -PRON- be bear in the lap of luxury 
-PRON- use the phrase broadly and loudly as -PRON- often use technical expression as if -PRON- wish -PRON- hearer to understand that -PRON- be use by -PRON- without conviction 
-PRON- mother must have go through a good deal of suffering -PRON- say then 
would -PRON- not try to save -PRON- from suffer more even if or would -PRON- 
if i could stephen say that would cost -PRON- very little 
then do so cranly say 
do as -PRON- wish -PRON- to do 
what be -PRON- for -PRON- 
-PRON- disbelieve in -PRON- 
-PRON- be a form nothing else 
and -PRON- will set -PRON- mind at rest 
-PRON- cease and as stephen do not reply remain silent 
then as if give utterance to the process of -PRON- own thought -PRON- say whatever else be unsure in this stink dunghill of a world a mother love be not 
-PRON- mother bring -PRON- into the world carry -PRON- first in -PRON- body 
what do -PRON- know about what -PRON- feel 
but whatever -PRON- feel -PRON- at least must be real 
-PRON- must be 
what be -PRON- idea or ambition 
play 
idea 
why that bloody bleat goat temple have idea have idea too 
every jackass go the road think -PRON- have idea 
stephen who have be listen to the unspoken speech behind the word say with assumed carelessness pascal if i remember rightly would not suffer -PRON- mother to kiss -PRON- as -PRON- fear the contact of -PRON- sex 
pascal be a pig say cranly 
aloysius gonzaga i think be of the same mind stephen say 
and -PRON- be another pig then say cranly 
the church call -PRON- a saint stephen object donot care a flame damn what anyone call -PRON- cranly say rudely and flatly 
i call -PRON- a pig 
stephen prepare the word neatly in -PRON- mind continue jesus too seem to have treat -PRON- mother with scant courtesy in public but suarez a jesuit theologian and spanish gentleman have apologise for -PRON- 
do the idea ever occur to -PRON- cranly ask that jesus be not what -PRON- pretend to be 
the first person to whom that idea occur stephen answer be jesus -PRON- mean cranly say harden in -PRON- speech do the idea ever occur to -PRON- that -PRON- be -PRON- a conscious hypocrite what -PRON- call the jew of -PRON- time a white sepulchre 
or to put -PRON- more plainly that -PRON- be a blackguard 
that idea never occur to -PRON- stephen answer 
but i be curious to know be -PRON- try to make a convert of -PRON- or a pervert of -PRON- 
-PRON- turn towards -PRON- friend face and see there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant 
cranly ask suddenly in a plain sensible tone tell -PRON- the truth 
be -PRON- at all shock by what i say 
somewhat stephen say 
and why be -PRON- shock cranly press on in the same tone if -PRON- feel sure that -PRON- religion be false and that jesus be not the son of god be not at all sure of -PRON- stephen say 
-PRON- be more like a son of god than a son of mary 
and be that why -PRON- will not communicate cranly ask because -PRON- be not sure of that too because -PRON- feel that the host too may be the body and blood of the son of god and not a wafer of bread 
and because -PRON- fear that -PRON- may be 
yes stephen say quietly i feel that and i also fear -PRON- see cranly say 
stephen strike by -PRON- tone of closure reopen the discussion at once by say fear many thing dog horse firearm the sea thunderstorm machinery the country road at night 
but why do -PRON- fear a bit of bread imagine stephen say that there be a malevolent reality behind those thing i say i fear 
do -PRON- fear then cranly ask that the god of the roman catholic would strike -PRON- dead and damn -PRON- if -PRON- make a sacrilegious communion 
the god of the roman catholic could do that now stephen say 
i fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in -PRON- soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which be mass twenty century of authority and veneration 
would -PRON- cranly ask in extreme danger commit that particular sacrilege 
for instance if -PRON- live in the penal day can not answer for the past stephen reply 
possibly not 
then say cranly -PRON- do not intend to become a protestant say that i have lose the faith stephen answer but not that i have lose selfrespect 
what kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which be logical and coherent and to embrace one which be illogical and incoherent 
-PRON- have walk on towards the township of pembroke and now as -PRON- go on slowly along the avenue the tree and the scatter light in the villa soothe -PRON- mind 
the air of wealth and repose diffuse about -PRON- seem to comfort -PRON- neediness 
behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmer in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant be hear singing as -PRON- sharpen knife 
-PRON- sing in short broken bar rosie cranly stop to listen say mulier cantat the soft beauty of the latin word touch with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman hand 
the strife of -PRON- mind be quell 
the figure of a woman as -PRON- appear in the liturgy of the church pass silently through the darkness a whiterobe figure small and slender as a boy and with a fall girdle 
-PRON- voice frail and high as a boy be hear intone from a distant choir the first word of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion et tu cum jesu galilo era and all heart be touch and turn to -PRON- voice shine like a young star shine clear as the voice intone the proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence die 
the singing cease 
-PRON- go on together cranly repeat in strongly stress rhythm the end of the refrain and when -PRON- be marry how happy well be for i love sweet rosie ogrady and rosie ogrady love -PRON- real poetry for -PRON- -PRON- say real love 
-PRON- glance sideways at stephen with a strange smile and say do -PRON- consider that poetry 
or do -PRON- know what the word mean want to see rosie first say stephen easy to find cranly say 
-PRON- hat have come down on -PRON- forehead 
-PRON- shove -PRON- back and in the shadow of the tree stephen see -PRON- pale face frame by the dark and -PRON- large dark eye 
yes 
-PRON- face be handsome and -PRON- body be strong and hard 
-PRON- have speak of a mother love 
-PRON- feel then the suffering of woman the weakness of -PRON- body and soul and would shield -PRON- with a strong and resolute arm and bow -PRON- mind to -PRON- 
away then -PRON- be time to go 
a voice speak softly to lonely heart bid -PRON- go and tell -PRON- that -PRON- friendship be come to an end 
yes -PRON- would go 
-PRON- could not strive against another 
-PRON- know -PRON- part 
probably i shall go away -PRON- say 
where 
cranly ask 
where i can stephen say 
yes cranly say 
-PRON- may be difficult for -PRON- to live here now 
but be -PRON- that make -PRON- go have to go stephen answer 
because cranly continue -PRON- need not look upon -PRON- as drive away if -PRON- do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw 
there be many good believer who think as -PRON- do 
would that surprise -PRON- 
the church be not the stone building nor even the clergy and -PRON- dogma 
-PRON- be the whole mass of those bear into -PRON- 
i donot know what -PRON- wish to do in life 
be -PRON- what -PRON- tell -PRON- the night -PRON- be stand outside harcourt street station 
yes stephen say smile in spite of -PRON- at way of remember thought in connexion with place 
the night -PRON- spend half an hour wrangle with doherty about the short way from sallygap to larra 
pothead 
cranly say with calm contempt 
what do -PRON- know about the way from sallygap to larra 
or what do -PRON- know about anything for that matter 
and the big slobbering washingpot head of -PRON- 
-PRON- break into a loud long laugh 
well 
stephen say 
do -PRON- remember the rest 
what -PRON- say be -PRON- 
cranly ask 
yes i remember -PRON- 
to discover the mode of life or of art whereby -PRON- spirit could express -PRON- in unfettered freedom 
stephen raise -PRON- hat in acknowledgement 
freedom 
cranly repeat 
but -PRON- be not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege 
tell -PRON- would -PRON- rob would beg first stephen say 
and if -PRON- get nothing would -PRON- rob 
-PRON- wish -PRON- to say stephen answer that the right of property be provisional and that in certain circumstance -PRON- be not unlawful to rob 
everyone would act in that belief 
so i will not make -PRON- that answer 
apply to the jesuit theologian juan mariana de talavera who will also explain to -PRON- in what circumstance -PRON- may lawfully kill -PRON- king and whether -PRON- have well hand -PRON- -PRON- poison in a goblet or smear -PRON- for -PRON- upon -PRON- robe or -PRON- saddlebow 
ask -PRON- rather would i suffer other to rob -PRON- or if -PRON- do would i call down upon -PRON- what i believe be call the chastisement of the secular arm 
and would -PRON- think stephen say -PRON- would pain -PRON- as much to do so as to be rob see cranly say 
-PRON- produce -PRON- match and begin to clean the crevice between two tooth 
then -PRON- say carelessly tell -PRON- for example would -PRON- deflower a virgin 
excuse -PRON- stephen say politely be that not the ambition of most young gentleman 
what then be -PRON- point of view 
cranly ask 
-PRON- last phrase sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and dishearten excited brain over which -PRON- fume seem to brood 
look here cranly -PRON- say 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- what i would do and what i would not do 
i will tell -PRON- what i will do and what i will not do 
i will not serve that in which i no longer believe whether -PRON- call -PRON- -PRON- home -PRON- fatherland or -PRON- church and i will try to express -PRON- in some mode of life or art as freely as i can and as wholly as i can use for -PRON- defence the only arm i allow -PRON- to usesilence exile and cunning 
cranly seize -PRON- arm and steer -PRON- round so as to lead -PRON- back towards leeson park 
-PRON- laugh almost slily and press arm with an elder affection 
cunne indeed -PRON- say 
be -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- poor poet -PRON- 
and -PRON- make -PRON- confess to -PRON- stephen say thrill by -PRON- touch as i have confess to -PRON- so many other thing have i not 
yes -PRON- child cranly say still gaily 
-PRON- make -PRON- confess the fear that i have 
but i will tell -PRON- also what i do not fear 
i do not fear to be alone or to be spurn for another or to leave whatever i have to leave 
and i be not afraid to make a mistake even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too 
cranly now grave again slow -PRON- pace and say alone quite alone 
-PRON- have no fear of that 
and -PRON- know what that word mean 
not only to be separate from all other but to have not even one friend will take the risk say stephen 
and not to have any one person cranly say who would be more than a friend more even than the noble and true friend a man ever have 
-PRON- word seem to have strike some deep chord in -PRON- own nature 
have -PRON- speak of -PRON- of -PRON- as -PRON- be or wish to be 
stephen watch -PRON- face for some moment in silence

a a the change of color be likely and a difference a very little difference be prepared 
sugar be not a vegetable 
callous be something that harden leave behind what will be soft if there be a genuine interest in there be present as many girl as man 
do this change 
-PRON- show that dirt be clean when there be a volume

suppose -PRON- do not like to change suppose -PRON- be very clean that there be no change in appearance supposing that there be regularity and a costume be that any the bad than an oyster and an exchange 
come to season that be there any extreme use in feather and cotton 
be there not much more joy in a table and more chair and very likely roundness and a place to put -PRON- 
a circle of fine card board and a chance to see a tassel 
what be the use of a violent kind of delightfulness if there be no pleasure in not get tired of -PRON-

some increase mean a calamity and this be the good preparation for three and more be together 
a little calm be so ordinary and in any case there be sweetness and some of that 
a seal and match and a swan and ivy and a suit 
a closet a closet do not connect under the bed

-PRON- be blond and incessant exposure to the sun have instead of tan -PRON- brown merely heighten the colour of -PRON- cheek 
-PRON- yellow hair have a tendency to curl in a forward direction just in front of the ear 
beside -PRON- presley make the sharp of contrast 
presley seem to have come of a mixed origin appear to have a nature more composite a temperament more complex 
unlike harran derrick -PRON- seem more of a character than a type

-PRON- eye be a dark brown and -PRON- forehead be the forehead of the intellectual wide and high with a certain unmistakable lift about -PRON- that argue education not only of -PRON- but of -PRON- people before -PRON- 
the impression convey by -PRON- mouth and chin be that of a delicate and highly sensitive nature the lip thin and loosely shut together the chin small and rather recede 
one guess that refinement have be gain only by a certain loss of strength 
one expect to find -PRON- nervous introspective to discover that -PRON- mental life be not at all the result of impression and sensation that come to -PRON- from without but rather of thought and reflection germinate from within 
though morbidly sensitive to change in -PRON- physical surrounding -PRON- would be slow to act upon such sensation would not prove impulsive not because -PRON- be sluggish but because -PRON- be merely irresolute 
-PRON- could be foresee that morally -PRON- be of that sort who avoid evil through good taste lack of decision and want of opportunity 
-PRON- temperament be that of the poet when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have be think -PRON- deceive -PRON-

-PRON- be in search of a subject something magnificent -PRON- do not know exactly what some vast tremendous theme heroic terrible to be unroll in all the thundering progression of hexameter 
but whatever -PRON- write and in whatever fashion presley be determine that -PRON- poem should be of the west that world frontier of romance where a new race a new peoplehardy brave and build an empire where the tumultuous life run like fire from dawn to dark and from dark to dawn again primitive brutal honest and without fear 
something to -PRON- idea not much have be do to catch at that life in pass but -PRON- poet have not yet arise 
the few sporadic attempt thus -PRON- tell -PRON- have only touch the keynote 
-PRON- strive for the diapason the great song that should embrace in -PRON- a whole epoch a complete era the voice of an entire people wherein all people should be and -PRON- legend -PRON- folk lore -PRON- fighting -PRON- love and -PRON- lust -PRON- blunt grim humour -PRON- stoicism under stress -PRON- adventure -PRON- treasure find in a day and gamble in a night -PRON- direct crude speech -PRON- generosity and cruelty -PRON- heroism and bestiality -PRON- religion and profanity -PRON- selfsacrifice and true and fearless set forth of a passing phase of history uncompromise sincere each group in -PRON- proper environment the valley the plain and the mountain the ranch the range and the this all the trait and type of every community from the dakota to the mexicos from winnipeg to guadalupe gather together sweep together weld and riven together in one single mighty song the song of the west 
that be what -PRON- dream while thing without for which no man have yet invent word terrible formless shape vague figure colossal monstrous at a gallop through -PRON- imagination 
as harran come up presley reach down into the pouch of the sunbleached shooting coat -PRON- wear and draw out and hand -PRON- the packet of letter and paper the mail 
i think i shall go on 
but dinner be ready say harran -PRON- be just sit down 
presley shake -PRON- head 
no in a hurry 
perhaps i shall have something to eat at guadalajara 
i shall be go all day 
-PRON- delay a few moment longer tighten a loose nut on -PRON- forward wheel while harran recognise -PRON- father handwrite on one of the envelope slit -PRON- open and cast -PRON- eye rapidly over -PRON- page 
the governor be come home -PRON- exclaim morning on the early train want -PRON- to meet -PRON- with the team at guadalajara -PRON- cry between -PRON- clenched tooth as -PRON- continue to read lose the case 
what case 
oh in the matter of rate 
harran nod -PRON- eye flash -PRON- face grow suddenly scarlet 
ulsteen give -PRON- decision yesterday -PRON- continue read from -PRON- father letter 
-PRON- hold ulsteen do that grain rate as low as the new figure would amount to confiscation of property and that on such a basis the railroad could not be operate at a legitimate profit 
as -PRON- be powerless to legislate in the matter -PRON- can only put the rate back at what -PRON- originally be before the commissioner make the cut and -PRON- be so order -PRON- friend behrman again add harran grind -PRON- tooth 
-PRON- be up in the city the whole of the time the new schedule be be draw and -PRON- and ulsteen and the railroad commission be as thick as thief 
-PRON- have be up there all this last week too do the railroad dirty work and backing ulsteen up 
legitimate profit legitimate profit -PRON- break out 
can -PRON- raise wheat at a legitimate profit with a tariff of four dollar a ton for move -PRON- two hundred mile to tidewater with wheat at eightyseven cent 
why not hold -PRON- up with a gun in -PRON- face and say hand up and be do with -PRON- 
-PRON- dig -PRON- bootheel into the ground and turn away to the house abruptly curse beneath -PRON- breath 
by the way presley call after -PRON- hooven want to see -PRON- 
-PRON- ask -PRON- about this idea of the of get along without the tenant this year 
hooven want to stay to tend the ditch and look after the stock 
i tell -PRON- to see -PRON- 
harran -PRON- mind full of other thing nod to say -PRON- understand 
presley only wait till -PRON- have disappear indoor so that -PRON- may not seem too indifferent to -PRON- trouble then remounting strike at once into a brisk pace and turn out from the carriage gate hold on swiftly down the low road go in the direction of guadalajara 
these matter these eternal fierce bickering between the farmer of the san joaquin and the pacific and southwestern railroad irritate -PRON- and weary -PRON- 
-PRON- care for none of these thing 
-PRON- do not belong to -PRON- world 
in the picture of that huge romantic west that -PRON- see in -PRON- imagination these dissension make the one note of harsh colour that refuse to enter into the great scheme of harmony 
-PRON- be material sordid deadly commonplace 
but however -PRON- strive to shut -PRON- eye to -PRON- or -PRON- ear to -PRON- the thing persist and persist 
the romance seem complete up to that point 
there -PRON- break there -PRON- fail there -PRON- become realism grim unlovely unyielding 
to be -PRON- be the first article of -PRON- creed to be unflinchingly could not ignore -PRON- 
all the noble poetry of the in -PRON- mind to be mar and disfigure by the presence of certain immovable fact 
just what -PRON- want presley hardly know 
on one hand -PRON- be -PRON- ambition to portray life as -PRON- see itdirectly frankly and through no medium of personality or temperament 
but on the other hand as well -PRON- wish to see everything through a rosecoloure mist that dull all harsh outline all crude and violent colour 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that as a part of the people -PRON- love the people and sympathise with -PRON- hope and fear and joy and grief and yet hooven grimy and perspire with -PRON- perpetual grievance and -PRON- contract horizon only revolt -PRON- 
-PRON- have set -PRON- the task of give true absolutely true poetical expression to the life of the ranch and yet again and again -PRON- bring up against the railroad that stubborn iron barrier against which -PRON- romance shatter -PRON- to froth and disintegrate fly spume 
-PRON- heart go out to the people and -PRON- grope hand meet that of a slovenly little dutchman whom -PRON- be impossible to consider seriously 
-PRON- search for the true romance and in the end find grain rate and unjust freight tariff 
but the stuff be -PRON- mutter as -PRON- send -PRON- wheel rumble across the bridge over broderson creek 
the romance the real romance be here somewhere get hold of -PRON- yet 
-PRON- shoot a glance about -PRON- as if in search of the inspiration 
by now -PRON- be not quite half way across the northern and narrow corner of los muertos at this point some eight mile wide 
-PRON- be still on the home ranch 
a few mile to the south -PRON- could just make out the line of wire fence that separate -PRON- from the third division and to the north see faint and blue through the haze and shimmer of the noon sun a long file of telegraph pole show the line of the railroad and mark northeast boundary 
the road over which presley be travel run almost diametrically straight 
in front of -PRON- but at a great distance -PRON- could make out the giant liveoak and the red roof of barn that stand near -PRON- 
all about -PRON- the country be flat 
in all direction -PRON- could see for mile 
the harvest be just over 
nothing but stubble remain on the ground 
with the one exception of the liveoak by place there be nothing green in sight 
the wheat stubble be of a dirty yellow the ground parch crack and dry of a cheerless brown 
by the roadside the dust lie thick and grey and on either hand stretch on toward the horizon lose -PRON- in a mere smudge in the distance run the illimitable parallel of the wire fence 
and that be all that and the burntout blue of the sky and the steady shimmer of the heat 
the silence be infinite 
after the harvest small though that harvest have be the ranch seem asleep 
-PRON- be as though the earth after -PRON- period of reproduction -PRON- pain of labour have be deliver of the fruit of -PRON- loin and now sleep the sleep of exhaustion 
-PRON- be the period between season when nothing be be do when the natural force seem to hang suspend 
there be no rain there be no wind there be no growth no life the very stubble have no force even to rot 
the sun alone move 
toward two oclock presley reach place two or three grimy frame building infest with a swarm of dog 
a hog or two wander aimlessly about 
under a shed by the barn a brokendown seeder lie rust to -PRON- ruin 
but overhead a mammoth liveoak the large tree in all the countryside tower superb and magnificent 
grey bunche of mistletoe and festoon of trail moss hang from -PRON- bark 
from -PRON- low branch hang meatsafe a square box face with wire screen 
what give a special interest to be the fact that here be the intersection of the low road and main irrigating ditch a vast trench not yet complete which -PRON- and annixter who work the quien sabe ranch be jointly construct 
-PRON- run directly across the road and at right angle to -PRON- and lie a deep groove in the field between and the town of guadalajara some three mile farther on 
besides this the ditch be a natural boundary between two division of the los muertos ranch the first and fourth 
presley now have the choice of two route 
-PRON- objective point be the spring at the headwater of broderson creek in the hill on the eastern side of the quien sabe ranch 
the trail afford -PRON- a short cut thitherward 
as -PRON- pass the house mrs hooven come to the door -PRON- little daughter hilda dress in a boy overall and clumsy boot at -PRON- skirt 
minna -PRON- old daughter a very pretty girl whose love affair be continually the talk of all los muertos be visible through a window of the house busy at the week wash 
mrs hooven be a fade colourless woman middleage and commonplace and offer not the least characteristic that would distinguish -PRON- from a thousand other woman of -PRON- class and kind 
-PRON- nod to presley watch -PRON- with a stolid gaze from under -PRON- arm which -PRON- hold across -PRON- forehead to shade -PRON- eye 
but now presley exert -PRON- in good earnest 
-PRON- bicycle fly 
-PRON- resolve that after all -PRON- would go to guadalajara 
-PRON- cross the bridge over the irrigating ditch with a brusque spurt of hollow sound and shoot forward down the last stretch of the low road that yet intervene between and the town 
-PRON- be on the fourth division of the ranch now the only one whereon the wheat have be successful no doubt because of the little mission creek that run through -PRON- 
but -PRON- no longer occupy -PRON- with the landscape 
-PRON- only concern be to get on as fast as possible 
-PRON- have look forward to spend nearly the whole day on the crest of the woode hill in the northern corner of the quien sabe ranch read idle smoke -PRON- pipe 
but now -PRON- would do well if -PRON- arrive there by the middle of the afternoon 
in a few moment -PRON- have reach the line fence that mark the limit of the ranch 
here be the railroad track and just huddle mass of roof with here and there an adobe house on -PRON- little town of guadalajara 
nearer at hand and directly in front of presley be the freight and passenger depot of the and paint in the grey and white which seem to be the official colour of all the building own by the corporation 
the station be desert 
no train pass at this hour 
from the direction of the ticket window presley hear the unsteady chittering of the telegraph key 
in the shadow of one of the baggage truck upon the platform the great yellow cat that belong to the agent doze complacently -PRON- paw tuck under -PRON- body 
three flat car load with brightpainted farming machine be on the siding above the station while on the switch below a huge freight engine that lack -PRON- cowcatcher sit back upon -PRON- monstrous drivingwheel motionless solid draw long breath that be punctuate by the subdued sound of -PRON- steampump clicking at exact interval 
but evidently -PRON- have be decree that presley should be stop at every point of -PRON- ride that day for as -PRON- be push -PRON- bicycle across the track -PRON- be surprised to hear -PRON- name call 
hello there mr presley the good word

but at the prospect of this further delay presley be less troubled

-PRON- brother and i will take up this hop ranch save a good deal in the last ten year and there ought to be money in hop 
presley go on remount -PRON- bicycle wheel silently through the desert street of the decayed and die mexican town 
-PRON- be the hour of the siesta 
nobody be about 
there be no business in the town 
-PRON- be too close to bonneville for that 
before the railroad come and in the day when the raising of cattle be the great industry of the country -PRON- have enjoy a fierce and brilliant life 
now -PRON- be moribund 
the drug store the two barroom the hotel at the corner of the old plaza and the shop where mexican curio be sell to those occasional eastern tourist who come to visit the mission of san juan suffice for the town activity 
at the restaurant on the plaza diagonally across from the hotel presley eat -PRON- longdeferre mexican omelette in spanishmexican style frijol and tortilla a salad and a glass of white wine 
in a corner of the room during the whole course of -PRON- dinner two young mexican one of whom be astonishingly handsome after the melodramatic fashion of -PRON- race and an old fellow the centenarian of the town decrepit beyond belief sing an interminable lovesong to the accompaniment of a guitar and an accordion 
these spanishmexican decay picturesque vicious and romantic never fail to interest presley 
a few of -PRON- still remain in guadalajara drift from the saloon to the restaurant and from the restaurant to the plaza relic of a former generation stand for a different order of thing absolutely idle live god know how happy with -PRON- cigarette -PRON- guitar -PRON- glass of mescal and -PRON- siesta 
the centenarian remember fremont and governor alvarado and the bandit jesus tejeda and the day when los muertos be a spanish grant a veritable principality league in extent and when there be never a fence from visalia to fresno 
upon this occasion presley offer the old man a drink of mescal and excite -PRON- to talk of the thing -PRON- remember 
-PRON- talk be in spanish a language with which presley be familiar 
de la cuesta hold the grant of los muertos in those day the centenarian say a grand man 
-PRON- have the power of life and death over -PRON- people and there be no law but -PRON- word 
there be no thought of wheat then -PRON- may believe

yes and there be wheat as well now that i come to think but a very the field north of the mission where now -PRON- be the seed ranch wheat field be there and also a vineyard all on mission ground 
wheat olive and the vine the father plant those to provide the element of the holy oil and wine -PRON- understand 
-PRON- be like that those industry begin in the church and now -PRON- put -PRON- chin in the air what would father ullivari have say to such a crop as senor derrick plant these day 
ten thousand acre of wheat 
nothing but wheat from the sierra to the coast range 
i remember when de la cuesta be marry 
-PRON- have never see the young lady only -PRON- miniature portrait raise a do not know by whom small a little thing to be hold in the palm 
but -PRON- fall in love with that and marry -PRON- -PRON- would 
the affair be arrange between -PRON- and the girl parent 
but when the time come that de la cuesta be to go to monterey to meet and marry the girl behold jesus tejeda break in upon the small ranchero near terrabella 
-PRON- be no time for de la cuesta to be away so -PRON- send -PRON- brother esteban to monterey to marry the girl by proxy for -PRON- 
i go with esteban 
-PRON- be a company nearly a hundred man 
and de la cuesta send a horse for the girl to ride white pure white and the saddle be of red leather the headstall the bit and buckle all the metal work of virgin silver

ah those be day 
that be a gay life make a comprehensive gesture with -PRON- left be stupid 
-PRON- may well say that observe presley moodily discourage by the other talk 
all -PRON- doubt and uncertainty have return to -PRON- 
never would -PRON- grasp the subject of -PRON- great poem the life be colourless 
romance be dead 
-PRON- have live too late 
to write of the past be not what -PRON- desire 
reality be what -PRON- long for thing that -PRON- have see 
yet how to make this compatible with romance 
-PRON- rise put on -PRON- hat offer the old man a cigarette 
the centenarian accept with the air of a grandee and extend -PRON- horn snuffbox 
presley shake -PRON- head be bear too late for that -PRON- declare for that and for many other thing

a true yankee that annixter a good gringo 
after -PRON- meal presley once more mount -PRON- bicycle and leave the restaurant and the plaza behind -PRON- hold on through the main street of the drowsing street that farther on develop into the road which turn abruptly northward and lead onward through the hopfield and the quien sabe ranch toward the mission of san juan 
the home ranch of the quien sabe be in the little triangle bound on the south by the railroad on the northwest by broderson creek and on the east by the hop field and the mission land 
-PRON- be traverse in all direction now by the trail from now by the irrigating same which presley have cross earlier in the again by the road upon which presley then find -PRON- 
in -PRON- centre be ranch house and barn top by the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well that be to feed the irrigate ditch 
farther on the course of broderson creek be mark by a curve line of greygreen willow while on the low hill to the north as presley advance the ancient mission of san juan de guadalajara with -PRON- belfry tower and redtile roof begin to show -PRON- over the crest of the venerable pear tree that cluster in -PRON- garden 
when presley reach ranch house -PRON- find young annixter -PRON- stretch in -PRON- hammock behind the mosquitobar on the front porch read david copperfield and gorge -PRON- with dry prune the two have exchange of terrific colic all the precede night 
-PRON- stomach be out of whack but -PRON- bet -PRON- know how to take care of -PRON- the last spell -PRON- have consult a doctor at bonneville a gibber busyface who have fill -PRON- up to the neck with a dose of some hogwash stuff that have make -PRON- healthy lot the doctor know anyhow case be peculiar know prune be what -PRON- need and by the pound 
annixter who work the quien sabe four thousand acre of rich clay and heavy a very young man younger even than presley like -PRON- a college graduate 
-PRON- look never a year old than -PRON- be 
-PRON- be smoothshaven and lean build 
but -PRON- youthful appearance be offset by a certain male cast of countenance the low lip thrust out the chin large and deeply cleft 
-PRON- university course have harden rather than polish -PRON- 
-PRON- still remain one of the people rough almost to insolence direct in speech intolerant in -PRON- opinion rely upon absolutely no one but -PRON- yet with all this of an astonishing degree of intelligence and possess of an executive ability little short of positive genius 
-PRON- be a ferocious worker allow -PRON- no pleasure and exact the same degree of energy from all -PRON- subordinate 
-PRON- be widely hate and as widely trust 
every one speak of -PRON- crusty temper and bully disposition invariably qualify the statement with a commendation of -PRON- resource and capability 
the devil of a driver a hard man to get along with obstinate contrary cantankerous but brain 
no doubt of that brain to -PRON- boot 
one would like to see the man who could get ahead of -PRON- on a deal 
twice -PRON- have be shoot at once from ambush on ranch and once by one of -PRON- own man whom -PRON- have kick from the sacking platform of -PRON- harvester for gross negligence 
at college -PRON- have specialise on finance political economy and scientific agriculture

in eight month -PRON- do the work of three year study for -PRON- bar examination 
-PRON- method of study be characteristic 
-PRON- reduce all the material of -PRON- textbook to note 
tear out the leave of these notebook -PRON- paste -PRON- upon the wall of -PRON- room then in -PRON- shirtsleeve a cheap cigar in -PRON- tooth -PRON- hand in -PRON- pocket -PRON- walk around and around the room scowl fiercely at -PRON- note memorise devour digesting

for presley annixter profess a great admiration hold in deep respect the man who could rhyme word defer to -PRON- whenever there be question of literature or work of fiction 
no doubt there be not much use in poetry and as for novel to -PRON- mind there be only work 
everything else be a lot of lie 
but just the same -PRON- take brain to grind out a poem 
-PRON- wasnot every one who could rhyme brave and glaive and make sense out of -PRON-

but case be a notable exception 
on no occasion be annixter prepared to accept another man opinion without reserve 
in conversation with -PRON- -PRON- be almost impossible to make any direct statement however trivial that -PRON- would accept without either modification or open contradiction 
-PRON- have a passion for violent discussion 
-PRON- would argue upon every subject in the range of human knowledge from astronomy to the tariff from the doctrine of predestination to the height of a horse 
never would -PRON- admit -PRON- to be mistake when corner -PRON- would intrench -PRON- behind the remark yes that s all very well 
in some way -PRON- be and then again in some way -PRON- singularly enough -PRON- and presley be the good of friend 
more than once presley marvel at this state of affair tell -PRON- that -PRON- and annixter have nothing in common 
in all -PRON- circle of acquaintance presley be the one man with whom annixter have never quarrel 
the two man be diametrically oppose in temperament 
presley be easygoe annixter alert 
presley be a confirm dreamer irresolute inactive with a strong tendency to melancholy the young farmer be a man of affair decisive combative whose only reflection upon -PRON- interior economy be a morbid concern in the vagary of -PRON- stomach 
yet the two never meet without a mutual pleasure take a genuine interest in each other affair and often put -PRON- to great inconvenience to be of trifle service to help one another 
as a last characteristic annixter pretend to be a womanhat for no other reason than that -PRON- be a very bullcalf of awkwardness in feminine surrounding 
feemale

after -PRON- return to -PRON- ranch a correspondence have be maintain between the two annixter take the precaution to typewrite -PRON- letter and never affix -PRON- signature in an excess of prudence 
-PRON- furthermore make carbon copy of all -PRON- letter file -PRON- away in a compartment of -PRON- safe 
ah -PRON- would be a clever feemale who would get -PRON- into a mess 
then suddenly smite with a panic terror that -PRON- have commit -PRON- that -PRON- be involve -PRON- too deeply -PRON- have abruptly send the little woman about -PRON- business

by the way -PRON- add see -PRON- barn be about do

in about a fortnight now shell be all ready a big barn murmur presley glance around the angle of the house toward where the great structure stand 
guess well have to have a dance there before -PRON- move the stock in observed annixter the custom all around here 
presley take -PRON- off but at the gate annixter call after -PRON- -PRON- mouth full of prune say take a look at that herd of sheep as -PRON- go up 
-PRON- be right off here to the east of the road about half a mile from here 
i guess that s the big lot of sheep ever see 
-PRON- may write a poem about -PRON- sheep day 
catch on 
beyond broderson creek as presley advanced tramping along on foot now the land open out again into the same vast space of dull brown earth sprinkle with stubble such as have be characteristic of ranch 
to the east the reach seem infinite flat cheerless heatridden unroll like a gigantic scroll toward the faint shimmer of the distant horizon with here and there an isolate liveoak to break the sombre monotony 
but border the road to the westward the surface roughen and raise clamber up to the high ground on the crest of which the old mission and -PRON- surround pear tree be now plainly visible 
just beyond the mission the road bend abruptly eastward strike off across the seed ranch 
but presley leave the road at this point go on across the open field 
there be no longer any trail 
-PRON- be toward three oclock 
the sun still spin a silent blazing disc high in the heaven and tramp through the clod of uneven broken plough be fatigue work 
the slope of the low foothill begin the surface of the country become roll and suddenly as -PRON- top a high ridge presley come upon the sheep 
already -PRON- have pass the large part of the intervene rise of ground have hide -PRON- from sight 
now as -PRON- turn half way about look down into the shallow hollow between -PRON- and the curve of the creek -PRON- see -PRON- very plainly 
the fringe of the herd be some two hundred yard distant but -PRON- farther side in that illusive shimmer of hot surface air seem mile away 
the sheep be spread out roughly in the shape of a figure eight two large herd connect by a small and be head to the southward move slowly graze on the wheat stubble as -PRON- proceed 
but the number seem incalculable 
hundred upon hundred upon hundred of grey rounded back all exactly alike huddled closepacke alive hide the earth from sight 
-PRON- be no longer an aggregate of individual 
-PRON- be a compact solid slowly move mass huge without form like a thickpresse growth of mushroom spread out in all direction over the earth 
from -PRON- there arise a vague murmur confuse inarticulate like the sound of very distant surf while all the air in the vicinity be heavy with the warm ammoniacal odour of the thousand of crowd body 
all the colour of the scene be brown of the earth the faded yellow of the dead stubble the grey of the myriad of undulate back 
only on the far side of the herd erect single note of black a speck a shepherd stand lean upon an empty watertrough solitary grave impressive 
for a few moment presley stand watch 
then as -PRON- start to move on a curious thing occur 
at first -PRON- think -PRON- have hear some one call -PRON- name 
-PRON- pause listen there be no sound but the vague noise of the move sheep 
then as this first impression pass -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- have be beckon to 
yet nothing stir except for the lonely figure beyond the herd there be no one in sight 
-PRON- start on again and in half a dozen step find -PRON- look over -PRON- shoulder 
without know why -PRON- look toward the shepherd then halt and look a second time and a third 
have the shepherd call to -PRON- 
presley know that -PRON- have hear no voice 
brusquely all -PRON- attention seem rivet upon this distant figure 
-PRON- put one forearm over -PRON- eye to keep off the sun gaze across the intervene herd 
surely the shepherd have call -PRON- 
but at the next instant -PRON- start utter an exclamation under -PRON- breath 
the faraway speck of black become animate 
presley remark a sweeping gesture 
though the man have not beckon to -PRON- before there be no doubt that -PRON- be beckon now 
without any hesitation and singularly interested in the incident presley turn sharply aside and hurry on toward the shepherd skirt the herd wonder all the time that -PRON- should answer the call with so little question so little hesitation 
but the shepherd come forward to meet presley follow by one of -PRON- dog 
as the two man approach each other presley closely study the other begin to wonder where -PRON- have see -PRON- before 
-PRON- must have be a very long time ago upon one of -PRON- previous visit to the ranch 
certainly however there be something familiar in the shepherd face and figure 
when -PRON- come closer to each other and presley could see -PRON- more distinctly this sense of a previous acquaintance be increase and sharpen 
the shepherd be a man of about thirtyfive 
-PRON- be very lean and spare 
-PRON- brown canvas overall be thrust into laced boot 
a cartridge belt without any cartridge encircle -PRON- waist 
a grey flannel shirt open at the throat show -PRON- breast tan and ruddy 
-PRON- wear no hat 
-PRON- hair be very black and rather long 
a pointed beard cover -PRON- chin grow straight and fine from the hollow cheek 
the absence of any covering for -PRON- head be no doubt habitual with -PRON- for -PRON- face be as brown as an ruddy brown quite different from dark olive 
to morbidly keen observation the general impression of the shepherd face be intensely interesting 
-PRON- be uncommon to an astonishing degree vivid imagination choose to see in -PRON- the face of an ascetic of a recluse almost that of a young seer 
so must have appear the halfinspired shepherd of the hebraic legend the young prophet of israel dweller in the wilderness beholder of vision have -PRON- existence in a continual dream talker with god gift with strange power 
suddenly at some twenty pace distant from the approach shepherd presley stop short -PRON- eye rivet upon the other 
vanamee -PRON- exclaim 
the shepherd smile and come forward hold out -PRON- hand say think -PRON- be -PRON- 
when i see -PRON- come over the hill i call -PRON- 
but not with -PRON- voice return presley know that some one want -PRON- 
i feel -PRON- 
i should have remember that -PRON- could do that kind of thing have never know -PRON- to fail 
-PRON- help with the sheep 
with the sheep 
in a way 
i canot tell exactly how 
-PRON- donot understand these thing yet 
there be time when if i close -PRON- eye and dig -PRON- fist into -PRON- temple i can hold the entire herd for perhaps a minute 
perhaps though -PRON- imagination who know 
but -PRON- good to see -PRON- again 
how long have -PRON- be since the last time 
two three nearly five year 
-PRON- be more than that 
-PRON- be six year since presley and vanamee have meet and then -PRON- have be for a short time only during one of the shepherd periodical brief return to that part of the country 
during a week -PRON- and presley have be much together for the two be devoted friend 
then as abruptly as mysteriously as -PRON- have come vanamee disappear 
presley awake one morning to find -PRON- go 
thus -PRON- have be with vanamee for a period of sixteen year 
-PRON- live -PRON- life in the unknown one could not tell the desert in the mountain throughout all the vast and vague solitary strange 
three four five year pass 
the shepherd would be almost forget 
never the most trivial scrap of information as to -PRON- whereabouts reach los muertos 
-PRON- have melt off into the surfaceshimmer of the desert into the mirage -PRON- sink below the horizon -PRON- be swallow up in the waste of sand and sage 
then without warn -PRON- would reappear come in from the wilderness emerge from the unknown 
no one know -PRON- well 
in all that countryside -PRON- have but three friend presley magnu derrick and the priest at the mission of san juan de guadalajara father sarria 
-PRON- remain always a mystery live a life halfreal halflegendary 
in all those year -PRON- do not seem to have grow old by a single day 
at this time presley know -PRON- to be thirtysix year of age 
but since the first day the two have meet the shepherd face and bearing have to -PRON- eye remain the same 
at this moment presley be look into the same face -PRON- have first see many many year ago 
-PRON- be a face stamp with an unspeakable sadness a deathless grief the permanent imprint of a tragedy long past but yet a living issue 
presley tell -PRON- that -PRON- be impossible to look long into eye without know that here be a man whose whole being have be at one time shatter and riven to -PRON- low depth whose life have suddenly stop at a certain moment of -PRON- development 
the two friend sit down upon the ledge of the wateringtrough -PRON- eye wander incessantly toward the slow move herd grazing on the wheat stubble move southward as -PRON- graze 
where have -PRON- come from this time 
presley have ask 
where have -PRON- keep -PRON- 
the other sweep the horizon to the south and east with a vague gesture 
off there down to the south very far off 
so many place that i canot remember 
i go the long trail this time a long long way 
arizona the mexicos and then afterwards utah and nevada follow the horizon travel at hazard 
into arizona first go in by monument pass and then on to the south through the country of the navajo down by the aga thia great blade of red rock jut from out the desert like a knife thrust 
then on and on through the mexicos all through the southwest then back again in a great circle by chihuahua and aldama to laredo to torreon and albuquerque 
from there across the uncompahgre plateau into the uintah country then at last due west through nevada to california and to the valley of the san joaquin 
-PRON- voice lapse to a monotone -PRON- eye become fix -PRON- continue to speak as though half awake -PRON- thought elsewhere see again in the eye of -PRON- mind the reach of desert and red hill the purple mountain the level stretch of alkali leper white all the savage gorgeous desolation of the long trail 
-PRON- ignore presley for the moment but on the other hand presley -PRON- give -PRON- but half -PRON- attention 
the return of vanamee have stimulate the poet memory 
-PRON- recall the incident of life review again that terrible drama which have uproot -PRON- soul which have drive -PRON- forth a wanderer a shunner of man a sojourner in waste place 
-PRON- be strangely enough a college graduate and a man of wide reading and great intelligence but -PRON- have choose to lead -PRON- own life which be that of a recluse 
of a temperament similar in many way to there be capability in vanamee that be not ordinarily to be find in the rank and file of man 
live close to nature a poet by instinct where presley be but a poet by train there develop in -PRON- a great sensitiveness to beauty and an almost abnormal capacity for great happiness and great sorrow -PRON- feel thing intensely deeply 
-PRON- never forget 
-PRON- be when -PRON- be eighteen or nineteen at the formative and most impressionable period of -PRON- life that -PRON- have meet angele varian 
presley barely remember -PRON- as a girl of sixteen beautiful almost beyond expression who live with an aged aunt on the seed ranch back of the mission 
at this moment -PRON- be try to recall how -PRON- look with -PRON- hair of gold hanging in two straight plait on either side of -PRON- face make threecornere -PRON- round white forehead -PRON- wonderful eye violet blue heavy lidde with -PRON- astonishing upward slant toward the temple the slant that give a strange oriental cast to -PRON- face perplex enchanting 
-PRON- remember the egyptian fulness of the lip the strange balancing movement of -PRON- head upon -PRON- slender neck the same movement that one see in a snake at poise 
never have -PRON- see a girl more radiantly beautiful never a beauty so strange so troublous so out of all accept standard 
-PRON- be small wonder that vanamee have love -PRON- and less wonder still that -PRON- love have be so intense so passionate so part of -PRON- 
angele have love -PRON- with a love no less than -PRON- own 
-PRON- be one of those legendary passion that sometimes occur idyllic untouche by civilisation spontaneous as the growth of tree natural as dewfall strong as the firmseate mountain 
at the time of -PRON- meeting with angele vanamee be live on the los muertos ranch 
-PRON- be there -PRON- have choose to spend one of -PRON- college vacation 
but -PRON- prefer to pass -PRON- in work sometimes herd cattle sometimes pitch hay sometimes work with pick and dynamitestick on the ditch in the fourth division of the ranch ride the range mend break in the wire fence make -PRON- generally useful 
college breed though -PRON- be the life please -PRON- 
-PRON- be as -PRON- desire close to nature live the full measure of life a worker among worker take enjoyment in simple pleasure healthy in mind and body 
-PRON- believe in an existence pass in this fashion in the country work hard eat full drinking deep sleeping dreamlessly 
but every night after supper -PRON- saddle -PRON- pony and ride over to the garden of the old mission 
the dobe divide wall on that side which once have separate the mission garden and the seed ranch have long since crumble away and the boundary between the two piece of ground be mark only by a line of venerable pear tree 
here under these tree -PRON- find angele await -PRON- and there the two would sit through the hot still even -PRON- arm about each other watch the moon rise over the foothill listen to the trickle of the water in the mossencrusted fountain in the garden and the steady croak of the great frog that live in the damp north corner of the enclosure 
through all one summer the enchantment of that newfound wonderful love pure and untainted fill the life of each of -PRON- with -PRON- sweetness 
the summer pass the harvest moon come and go 
the night be very dark 
in the deep shade of the pear tree -PRON- could no longer see each other 
when -PRON- meet at the rendezvous vanamee find -PRON- only with -PRON- grope hand 
-PRON- do not speak mere word be useless between -PRON- 
silently as -PRON- reach hand touch -PRON- warm body -PRON- take -PRON- in -PRON- arm search for -PRON- lip with -PRON- 
then one night the tragedy have suddenly leap from out the shadow with the abruptness of an explosion 
-PRON- be impossible afterwards to reconstruct the manner of -PRON- occurrence 
to there be leave of matter always remain a hideous blur a blot a vague terrible confusion 
no doubt -PRON- two have be watch the plan succeed too well for any other supposition 
one moonless night angele arrive under the black shadow of the pear tree a little earlier than usual find the apparently familiar figure wait for -PRON- 
all unsuspecting -PRON- give -PRON- to the embrace of a strange pair of arm and vanamee arrive but a score of moment later stumble over -PRON- prostrate body inert and unconscious in the shadow of the overspire tree 
who be the other 
angele be carry to -PRON- home on the seed ranch delirious all but rave and vanamee with knife and revolver ready range the countryside like a wolf 
-PRON- be not alone 
the whole county rise rage horrorstruck 
posse after posse be form send out and return without so much as a clue 
upon no one could even the shadow of suspicion be throw 
the other have withdraw into an impenetrable mystery 
there -PRON- remain 
-PRON- never be find -PRON- never be so much as hear of 
a legend arise about -PRON- this prowler of the night this strange fearful figure with an unseen face swoop in there from out the darkness come and go in an instant but leave behind -PRON- a track of terror and death and rage and undye grief 
within the year in give birth to the child angele have die 
the little babe be take by parent and angele be bury in the mission garden near to the aged grey sun dial 
vanamee stand by during the ceremony but half conscious of what be go forward 
at the last moment -PRON- have step forward look long into the dead face frame in -PRON- plait of gold hair the hair that make threecornere the round white forehead look again at the close eye with -PRON- perplex upward slant toward the temple oriental bizarre at the lip with -PRON- egyptian fulness at the sweet slender neck the long slim hand then abruptly turn about 
the last clod be fill the grave at a time when -PRON- be already far away -PRON- horse head turn toward the desert 
for two year no syllable be hear of -PRON- 
-PRON- be believe that -PRON- have kill -PRON- 
but vanamee have no thought of that 
for two year -PRON- wander through arizona live in the desert in the wilderness a recluse a nomad an ascetic 
but doubtless all -PRON- heart be in the little coffin in the mission garden 
once in so often -PRON- must come back thither 
one day -PRON- be see again in the san joaquin 
the priest father sarria return from a visit to the sick at bonneville meet -PRON- on the upper road 
eighteen year have pass since angele have die but the thread of life have be snap 
nothing remain now but the tangle end 
-PRON- have never forget 
the long dull ache the poignant grief have now become a part of -PRON- 
presley know this to be so 
while presley have be reflect upon all this vanamee have continue to speak 
presley however have not be wholly inattentive 
while -PRON- memory be busy reconstruct the detail of the drama of the shepherd life another part of -PRON- brain have be swiftly register picture after picture that monotonous flow of word strike off as -PRON- be upon a steadily move scroll 
the music of the unfamiliar name that occur in -PRON- recital be a stimulant to the poet imagination 
presley have the poet passion for expressive sonorous name 
as these come and go in monotonous undertone like little note of harmony in a musical progression -PRON- listen delighted with -PRON- quijotoa uintah sonora laredo -PRON- -PRON- be so many symbol 
-PRON- be -PRON- west that pass unroll there before the eye of -PRON- mind the open heatscourge round of desert the mesa like a vast altar shimmer purple in the royal sunset the still gigantic mountain heave into the sky from out the canyon the strenuous fierce life of isolate town lose and forget down there far off below the horizon 
abruptly -PRON- great poem -PRON- song of the west leap up again in -PRON- imagination 
for the moment -PRON- all but hold -PRON- 
-PRON- be there close at hand 
in another instant -PRON- would grasp -PRON- 
yes yes -PRON- exclaim can see -PRON- all 
the desert the mountain all wild primordial untamed 
how i should have love to have be with -PRON- 
then perhaps i should have get hold of -PRON- idea 
-PRON- idea 
the great poem of the west that which i want to write 
oh to put -PRON- all into hexameter strike the great iron note sing the vast terrible song the song of the people the forerunner of empire 
vanamee understand -PRON- perfectly 
-PRON- nod gravely 
yes -PRON- be there 
-PRON- be life the primitive simple direct life passionate tumultuous 
yes there be an epic there 
presley catch at the word 
-PRON- have never before occur to -PRON- 
epic yes that s -PRON- 
-PRON- be the epic search for 
and i search for -PRON- 
-PRON- donot know 
-PRON- be sometimes almost an agony 
often and often i can feel -PRON- right there there at -PRON- fingertip but i never quite catch -PRON- 
-PRON- always elude -PRON- 
i be bear too late 
ah to get back to that first cleareyed view of thing to see as homer see as beowulf see as the nibelungen poet see 
the life be here the same as then the poem be here -PRON- west be here the primeval epic life be here here under -PRON- hand in the desert in the mountain on the ranch all over here from winnipeg to guadalupe 
-PRON- be the man who be lack the poet -PRON- have be educate away from -PRON- all 
-PRON- be out of touch 
-PRON- be out of tune 
vanamee hear -PRON- to the end -PRON- grave sad face thoughtful and attentive 
then -PRON- rise be go over to the mission -PRON- say to see father sarria 
i have not see -PRON- yet 
how about the sheep 
the dog will keep -PRON- in hand and i shall not be go long 
besides that i have a boy here to help 
-PRON- be over yonder on the other side of the herd 
-PRON- canot see -PRON- from here 
presley wonder at the heedlessness of leave the sheep so slightly guard but make no comment and the two start off across the field in the direction of the mission church 
well yes -PRON- be epic observe vanamee as -PRON- go along 
but why write 
why not in -PRON- 
steep oneself in the heat of the desert the glory of the sunset the blue haze of the mesa and the canyon 
as -PRON- have do for instance 
vanamee nod 
no i could not do that declare presley want to go back but not so far as -PRON- 
i feel that i must compromise 
i must find expression 
i could not lose -PRON- like that in -PRON- desert 
when -PRON- vastness overwhelm -PRON- or -PRON- beauty dazzle -PRON- or -PRON- loneliness weigh down upon -PRON- i should have to record -PRON- impression 
otherwise i should suffocate 
each to -PRON- own life observe vanamee 
the mission of san juan build of brown dobe block cover with yellow plaster that at many point have drop away from the wall stand on the crest of a low rise of the ground face to the south 
a cover colonnade pave with round worn brick from whence open the door of the abandon cell once use by the monk adjoin -PRON- on the left 
the roof be of tile halfcylinder split longitudinally and lay in alternate row now concave now convex 
the main body of the church -PRON- be at right angle to the colonnade and at the point of intersection rise the belfry tower an ancient campanile where swing the three crack bell the gift of the king of spain 
beyond the church be the mission garden and the graveyard that overlook the seed ranch in a little hollow beyond 
presley and vanamee go down the long colonnade to the last door next the belfry tower and vanamee pull the leather thong that hang from a hole in the door set a little bell jangle somewhere in the interior 
the place but for this noise be shroud in a sunday stillness an absolute repose 
only at interval one hear the trickle of the unseen fountain and the liquid cooing of dove in the garden 
father sarria open the door 
-PRON- be a small man somewhat stout with a smooth and shiny face 
-PRON- wear a frock coat that be rather dirty slipper and an old yachting cap of blue cloth with a broken leather vizor 
-PRON- be smoke a cheap cigar very fat and black 
but instantly -PRON- recognise vanamee 
-PRON- face go all alight with pleasure and astonishment 
-PRON- seem as if -PRON- would never have finish shake both -PRON- hand and as -PRON- be -PRON- release but one of -PRON- pat -PRON- affectionately on the shoulder with the other 
-PRON- be voluble in -PRON- welcome talk partly in spanish partly in english 
so -PRON- have come back again this great fellow tan as an indian lean as an indian with an long black hair 
but -PRON- have not change not in the very least 
-PRON- beard have not grow an inch 
aha 
the rascal never to give warning to drop down as -PRON- be from out the sky 
such a hermit 
to live in the desert 
a veritable saint jerome 
do a lion feed -PRON- down there in arizona or be -PRON- a raven like elijah 
the good god have not fatten -PRON- at any rate and apropos -PRON- be just about to dine -PRON- 
-PRON- have make a salad from -PRON- own lettuce 
the two would dine with -PRON- eh 
for this -PRON- son that be lose be find again 
but presley excuse -PRON- 
instinctively -PRON- feel that sarria and vanamee want to talk of thing concern which -PRON- be an outsider 
-PRON- be not at all unlikely that vanamee would spend half the night before the high altar in the church 
-PRON- take -PRON- away -PRON- mind still busy with extraordinary life and character 
but as -PRON- descend the hill -PRON- be startle by a prolonged and raucous cry discordant very harsh thrice repeat at exact interval and look up -PRON- see one of father peacock balance -PRON- upon the topmost wire of the fence -PRON- long tail trail -PRON- neck outstretche fill the air with -PRON- stupid outcry for no reason than the desire to make a noise 
about an hour later toward four in the afternoon presley reach the spring at the head of the little canyon in the northeast corner of the quien sabe ranch the point toward which -PRON- have be travel since early in the forenoon 
the place be not without -PRON- charm 
innumerable liveoak overhung the canyon and broderson a mere rivulet run down from the a certain coolness to the air 
-PRON- be one of the few spot thereabout that have survive the dry season of the last year 
nearly all the other spring have dry completely while mission creek on ranch be nothing well than a dusty cutting in the ground fill with brittle concave flake of dry and suncracke mud 
presley climb to the summit of one of the rise out of the canyon from the crest of which -PRON- could see for thirty fifty sixty mile down the valley and fill -PRON- pipe smoke lazily for upward of an hour -PRON- head empty of thought allow -PRON- to succumb to a pleasant gentle inanition a little drowsy comfortable in -PRON- place prone upon the ground warm just enough by such sunlight as filter through the liveoak soothe by the good tobacco and the prolonged murmur of the spring and creek 
by degree the sense of -PRON- own personality become blunt the little wheel and cog of thought move slow and slow consciousness dwindle to a point the animal in -PRON- stretch -PRON- purr 
a delightful numbness invade -PRON- mind and -PRON- body 
-PRON- be not asleep -PRON- be not awake stupefy merely lapse back to the state of the faun the satyr 
after a while rouse -PRON- a little -PRON- shift -PRON- position and draw from the pocket of -PRON- shoot coat -PRON- little treecalf edition of the odyssey read far into the twentyfirst book where after the failure of all the suitor to bend bow -PRON- be finally put with mockery into -PRON- own hand 
abruptly the drama of the story rouse -PRON- from all -PRON- languor 
in an instant -PRON- be the poet again -PRON- nerve tingle alive to every sensation responsive to every impression 
the desire of creation of composition grow big within -PRON- 
hexameter of -PRON- own clamoured tumultuous in -PRON- brain 
not for a long time have -PRON- feel -PRON- poem as -PRON- call this sensation so poignantly 
for an instant -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- actually hold -PRON- 
-PRON- be no doubt talk that have stimulate -PRON- to this point 
the story of the long trail with -PRON- desert and mountain -PRON- cliffdweller -PRON- aztec ruin -PRON- colour movement and romance fill -PRON- mind with picture after picture 
the epic defile before -PRON- vision like a pageant 
once more -PRON- shoot a glance about -PRON- as if in search of the inspiration and this time -PRON- all but find -PRON- 
-PRON- rise to -PRON- foot look out and off below -PRON- 
as from a pinnacle presley from where -PRON- now stand dominate the entire country 
the sun have begin to set everything in the range of -PRON- vision be overlay with a sheen of gold 
first close at hand -PRON- be the seed ranch carpet the little hollow behind the mission with a spread of green some dark some vivid some pale almost to yellowness 
beyond that be the mission -PRON- -PRON- venerable campanile in whose arch hang the spanish bell already glow ruddy in the sunset 
farther on -PRON- could make out ranch house mark by the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well and a little farther to the east the huddled tile roof of guadalajara 
far to the west and north -PRON- see bonneville very plain and the dome of the courthouse a purple silhouette against the glare of the sky 
other point detach -PRON- swim in a golden mist project blue shadow far before -PRON- the mammoth liveoak by tower superb and magnificent the line of eucalyptus tree behind which -PRON- know be the los muertos ranch home the wateringtank the great ironhooped tower of wood that stand at the joining of the low road and the county road the long windbreak of poplar tree and the white wall of saloon on the county road 
but all this seem to be only foreground a mere array of mass of irrelevant detail 
beyond beyond guadalajara beyond the low road beyond broderson creek on to the south and west infinite illimitable stretch out there under the sheen of the sunset forever and forever flat vast unbroken a huge scroll unroll between the horizon spread the great stretch of the ranch of los muertos bare of crop shave close in the recent harvest 
near at hand be hill but on that far southern horizon only the curve of the great earth -PRON- check the view 
adjoin los muertos and widen to the west open the broderson ranch 
the osterman ranch to the northwest carry on the great sweep of landscape ranch after ranch 
then as the imagination -PRON- expand under the stimulus of that measureless range of vision even those great ranch resolve -PRON- into mere foreground mere accessory irrelevant detail 
beyond the fine line of the horizon over the curve of the globe the shoulder of the earth be other ranch equally vast and beyond these other and beyond these still other the immensity multiply lengthen out vaster and vaster 
the whole gigantic sweep of the san joaquin expand titanic before the eye of the mind flagellate with heat quiver and shimmer under the sun red eye 
at long interval a faint breath of wind out of the south pass slowly over the level of the baked and empty earth accentuate the silence mark off the stillness 
-PRON- seem to exhale from the land -PRON- a prolonged sigh as of deep fatigue 
-PRON- be the season after the harvest and the great earth the mother after -PRON- period of reproduction -PRON- pain of labour deliver of the fruit of -PRON- loin sleep the sleep of exhaustion the infinite repose of the colossus benignant eternal strong the nourisher of nation the feeder of an entire world 
ha there -PRON- be -PRON- epic -PRON- inspiration -PRON- west -PRON- thundering progression of hexameter 
a sudden uplift a sense of exhilaration of physical exaltation appear abruptly to sweep presley from -PRON- foot 
as from a point high above the world -PRON- seem to dominate a universe a whole order of thing 
-PRON- be dizzy stunned stupefy -PRON- morbid supersensitive mind reel drunk with the intoxication of mere immensity 
stupendous idea for which there be no name drive headlong through -PRON- brain 
terrible formless shape vague figure gigantic monstrous distort whirl at a gallop through -PRON- imagination 
-PRON- start homeward still in -PRON- dream descend from the hill emerge from the canyon and take the short cut straight across the quien sabe ranch leave guadalajara far to -PRON- left 
-PRON- tramp steadily on through the wheat stubble walk fast -PRON- head in a whirl 
never have -PRON- so nearly grasp -PRON- inspiration as at that moment on the hilltop 
even now though the sunset be fade though the wide reach of valley be shut from sight -PRON- still keep -PRON- company 
now the detail come throng component part of -PRON- poem the sign and symbol of the west 
-PRON- be there close at hand -PRON- have be in touch with -PRON- all day 
-PRON- be in the centenarian vividly colour la cuesta hold -PRON- grant from the spanish crown with -PRON- power of life and death the romance of -PRON- marriage the white horse with -PRON- pillion of red leather and silver bridle mounting the bullfight in the plaza the gift of gold dust and horse and tallow 
-PRON- be in strange history the tragedy of -PRON- love angele varian with -PRON- marvellous loveliness the egyptian fulness of -PRON- lip the perplex upward slant of -PRON- violet eye bizarre oriental -PRON- white forehead make three corner by -PRON- plait of gold hair the mystery of the other -PRON- death at the moment of -PRON- child birth 
-PRON- be in flight into the wilderness the story of the long trail the sunset behind the altarlike mesas the bake desolation of the desert the strenuous fierce life of forget town down there far off lose below the horizon of the southwest the sonorous music of unfamiliar uintah sonora laredo uncompahgre 
-PRON- be in the mission with -PRON- crack bell -PRON- decay wall -PRON- venerable sun dial -PRON- fountain and old garden and in the mission father -PRON- the priest the padre plant the first wheat and oil and wine to produce the element of the trinity of great industry take -PRON- rise in a religious rite 
abruptly as if in confirmation presley hear the sound of a bell from the direction of the mission -PRON- 
-PRON- be the de profundi a note of the old world of the ancient regime an echo from the hillside of mediaeval europe sound there in this new land unfamiliar and strange at this time 
by now however -PRON- be dark 
presley hurry forward 
-PRON- come to the line fence of the quien sabe ranch 
everything be very still 
the star be all out 
there be not a sound other than the de profundis still sound from very far away 
at long interval the great earth sigh dreamily in -PRON- sleep 
all about the feeling of absolute peace and quiet and security and untrouble happiness and content seem descend from the star like a benediction 
the beauty of -PRON- poem -PRON- idyl come to -PRON- like a caress that alone have be lack 
-PRON- be that perhaps which have leave -PRON- hitherto incomplete 
at last -PRON- be to grasp -PRON- song in all -PRON- entity 
but suddenly there be an interruption 
presley have climb the fence at the limit of the quien sabe ranch 
beyond be los muertos but between the two run the railroad 
-PRON- have only time to jump back upon the embankment when with a quivering of all the earth a locomotive single unattached shoot by -PRON- with a roar fill the air with the reek of hot oil vomiting smoke and spark -PRON- enormous eye cyclopean red throw a glare far in advance shooting by in a sudden crash of confused thunder fill the night with the terrific clamour of -PRON- iron hoof 
abruptly presley remember 
this must be the crack passenger engine of which dyke have tell -PRON- the one delay by the accident on the bakersfield division and for whose passage the track have be open all the way to fresno 
before presley could recover from the shock of the irruption while the earth be still vibrate the rail still hum the engine be far away fling the echo of -PRON- frantic gallop over all the valley 
for a brief instant -PRON- roar with a hollow diapason on the long trestle over broderson creek then plunge into a cutting farther on the quiver glare of -PRON- fire lose -PRON- in the night -PRON- thunder abruptly diminish to a subdued and distant humming 
all at once this cease 
the engine be go 
but the moment the noise of the engine lapse to start forward conscious of a confusion of lamentable sound that rise into the night from out the engine wake 
prolong cry of agony sob wail of infinite pain heartrending pitiful 
the noise come from a little distance 
-PRON- run down the track cross the culvert over the irrigate ditch and at the head of the long reach of the culvert and the long abruptly hold immovable at the sight of the ground and rail all about -PRON- 
in some way the herd of find a breach in the wire fence by the right of way and have wander out upon the track 
a band have be cross just at the moment of the engine passage 
the pathos of -PRON- be beyond expression 
-PRON- be a slaughter a massacre of innocent 
the iron monster have charge full into the midst merciless inexorable 
to the right and leave all the width of the right of way the little body have be fling back be snap against the fence post brain knock out 
catch in the barb of the wire wedge in the body hang suspend 
under foot -PRON- be terrible 
the black blood wink in the starlight seep down into the clinker between the tie with a prolonged suck murmur 
presley turn away horrorstruck sick at heart overwhelm with a quick burst of irresistible compassion for this brute agony -PRON- could not relieve 
the sweetness be go from the evening the sense of peace of security and placid contentment be stricken from the landscape 
the hideous ruin in the engine path drive all thought of -PRON- poem from -PRON- mind 
the inspiration vanish like a mist 
the de profundis have cease to ring 
-PRON- hurry on across the los muertos ranch almost run even put -PRON- hand over -PRON- ear till -PRON- be out of hear distance of that all but human distress 
not until -PRON- be beyond earshot do -PRON- pause look back listening 
the night have shut down again 
for a moment the silence be profound unbroken 
then faint and prolong across the level of the ranch -PRON- hear the engine whistle for bonneville 
again and again at rapid interval in -PRON- flying course -PRON- whistle for road crossing for sharp curve for trestle ominous note hoarse bellow ringing with the accent of menace and defiance and abruptly presley see again in -PRON- imagination the galloping monster the terror of steel and steam with -PRON- single eye cyclopean red shooting from horizon to horizon but see -PRON- now as the symbol of a vast power huge terrible fling the echo of -PRON- thunder over all the reach of the valley leave blood and destruction in -PRON- path the leviathan with tentacle of steel clutch into the soil the soulless force the ironhearte power the monster the colossus the octopus 
on the following morning harran derrick be up and about by a little after six oclock and a quarter of an hour later have breakfast in the kitchen of the ranch house prefer not to wait until the chinese cook lay the table in the regular diningroom 
-PRON- scent a hard day work ahead of -PRON- and be anxious to be at -PRON- betime 
-PRON- be practically the manager of los muertos and with the aid of -PRON- foreman and three division superintendent carry forward nearly the entire direction of the ranch occupy -PRON- with the detail of -PRON- father plan execute -PRON- order signing contract pay bill and keep the book 
for the last three week little have be do 
the as -PRON- be harvest and sell and there have be a general relaxation of activity for upward of a month 
now however the fall be come on the dry season be about at -PRON- end any time after the twentieth of the month the first rain may be expect soften the ground put -PRON- into condition for the plough 
two day before this harran have notify -PRON- superintendent on three and four to send in such grain as -PRON- have reserve for seed 
on two the wheat have not even show -PRON- above the ground while on one the home ranch which be under -PRON- own immediate supervision the seed have already be grade and select 
-PRON- be intention to commence bluestone -PRON- seed that day a delicate and important process which prevent rust and smut appear in the crop when the wheat should come up 
but furthermore -PRON- want to find time to go to guadalajara to meet the governor on the morning train 
-PRON- day promise to be busy 
but as harran be finish -PRON- last cup of coffee phelps the foreman on the home ranch who also look after the storage barn where the seed be keep present -PRON- cap in hand on the back porch by the kitchen door think speak to -PRON- about the seed from four sir -PRON- say 
that hasnot be bring in yet 
harran nod see about -PRON- get all the bluestone -PRON- want have -PRON- phelp and without wait for an answer -PRON- add tell the stableman i shall want the team about nine oclock to go to guadalajara 
put -PRON- in the buggy 
the bay -PRON- understand 
when the other have go harran drink off the rest of -PRON- coffee and rise pass through the diningroom and across a stonepaved hallway with a glass roof into the office just beyond 
the office be the nervecentre of the entire ten thousand acre of los muertos but -PRON- appearance and furnishing be not in the least suggestive of a farm 
-PRON- be divide at about -PRON- middle by a wire rail paint green and gold and behind this railing be the high desk where the book be keep the safe the letterpress and letterfile and typewrite machine 
a great map of los muertos with every watercourse depression and elevation together with indication of the vary depth of the clay and loam in the soil accurately plot hang against the wall between the window while near at hand by the safe be the telephone 
but no doubt the most significant object in the office be the ticker 
this be an innovation in the san joaquin an idea of shrewd quickwitte young annixter which harran and magnus derrick have be quick to adopt and after -PRON- broderson and osterman and many other of the wheat grower of the county 
the office of the ranch be thus connect by wire with san francisco and through that city with minneapolis duluth chicago new york and at last and most important of all with liverpool 
fluctuation in the price of the world crop during and after the harvest thrill straight to the office of los muertos to that of the quien sabe to and to during a flurry in the chicago wheat pit in the august of that year which have affect even the san francisco market harran and magnus have sit up nearly half of one night watch the strip of white tape jerk unsteadily from the reel 
at such moment -PRON- no longer feel -PRON- individuality 
the ranch become merely the part of an enormous whole a unit in the vast agglomeration of wheat land the whole world round feel the effect of cause thousand of mile drought on the prairie of dakota a rain on the plain of india a frost on the russian steppe a hot wind on the llano of the argentine 
harran cross over to the telephone and rang six bell the call for the division house on four 
-PRON- be the most distant the most isolated point on all the ranch situate at -PRON- far southeastern extremity where few people ever go close to the line fence a dot a speck lose in the immensity of the open country 
by the road -PRON- be eleven mile distant from the office and by the trail to and the low road all of nine 
how about that seed demand harran when -PRON- have get cutter on the line 
the other make excuse for an unavoidable delay and be add that -PRON- be on the point of start out when harran cut in with -PRON- have better go the trail 
-PRON- will save a little time and i be in a hurry 
put -PRON- sack on the horse back 
and cutter if -PRON- see hooven when -PRON- go by -PRON- place tell -PRON- i want -PRON- and by the way take a look at the end of the irrigating ditch when -PRON- get to -PRON- 
see how -PRON- be get along there and if billy want anything 
tell -PRON- -PRON- be expect those new scoop down tomorrow or next day and to get along with what -PRON- have until then everything on four 
all right then 
give -PRON- seed to phelps when -PRON- get here if i be not about 
i be go to guadalajara to meet the governor come down today 
and that make -PRON- think -PRON- lose the case -PRON- know 
i have a letter from the governor yesterday 
yes hard luck 
behrman do -PRON- up 
well goodbye and donot lose any time with that seed 
i want to bluestone today 
after telephone cutter harran put on -PRON- hat go over to the barn and find phelp 
phelp have already clean out the vat which be to contain the solution of bluestone and be now at work regrade the seed 
against the wall behind -PRON- range the row of sack 
harran cut the fastening of these and examine the content carefully take handful of wheat from each and allow -PRON- to run through -PRON- finger or nip the grain between -PRON- nail test -PRON- hardness 
the seed be all of the white variety of wheat and of a very high grade the berry hard and heavy rigid and swollen with starch 
if -PRON- be all like that sir hey observe phelp 
harran put -PRON- chin in the air 
bread would be as good as cake then -PRON- answer go from sack to sack inspect the content and consult the tag affix to the mouth 
hello -PRON- remark a red wheat 
where do this come from that red clawson -PRON- sow to the piece on four north the mission creek just to see how -PRON- would do here 
-PRON- didnot get a very good catch 
-PRON- canot do better than to stay by white sonora and propo remark harran get -PRON- good result with that and european miller like -PRON- to mix with the eastern wheat that have more gluten than our 
that be if -PRON- have any wheat at all next year 
a feeling of discouragement for the moment bear down heavily upon -PRON- 
at interval this come to -PRON- and for the moment -PRON- be overpower 
the idea of whatstheuse be upon occasion a veritable oppression 
everything seem to combine to lower the price of wheat 
the extension of wheat area always exceed increase of population competition be grow fiercer every year 
the farmer profit be the object of attack from a score of different quarter 
-PRON- be a flock of vulture descend upon a common commission merchant the elevator combine the mixinghouse re the bank the warehouse man the labour man and above all the railroad 
steadily the liverpool buyer cut and cut and cut 
everything every element of the world market tend to force down the price to the low possible figure at which -PRON- could be profitably farm 
now -PRON- be down to eightyseven 
-PRON- be at that figure the crop have sell that year and to think that the governor have see wheat at two dollar and five cent in the year of the turkorussian war 
-PRON- turn back to the house after give phelps final direction gloomy dishearten -PRON- hand deep in -PRON- pocket wonder what be to be the outcome 
so narrow have the margin of profit shrunk that a dry season mean bankruptcy to the small farmer throughout all the valley 
-PRON- know very well how widespread have be the distress the last two year 
with -PRON- own tenant on los muertos affair have reach the stage of desperation 
derrick have practically be oblige to carry hooven and some of the other 
the governor -PRON- have make almost nothing during the last season a third year like the last with the price steadily sag mean nothing else but ruin 
but here -PRON- check -PRON- 
two consecutive dry season in california be almost unprecedented a third would be beyond belief and the complete rest for nearly all the land be a compensation 
-PRON- have make no money that be true but -PRON- have lose none 
thank god the homestead be free of mortgage one good season would more than make up the difference 
-PRON- be in a well mood by the time -PRON- reach the driveway that lead up to the ranch house and as -PRON- raise -PRON- eye toward the house -PRON- -PRON- could not but feel that the sight of -PRON- home be cheer 
the ranch house be set in a great grove of eucalyptus oak and cypress enormous tree grow from out a lawn that be as green as fresh and as wellgroome as any in a garden in the city 
this lawn flank all one side of the house and -PRON- be on this side that the family elect to spend most of -PRON- time 
the other side look out upon the home ranch toward bonneville and the railroad be but little used 
a deep porch run the whole length of the house here and in the low branch of a liveoak near the step harran have build a little summer house for -PRON- mother 
to the left of the ranch house -PRON- toward the county road be the bunkhouse and kitchen for some of the hand 
from the step of the porch the view to the southward expand to infinity 
there be not so much as a twig to obstruct the view 
in one leap the eye reach the fine delicate line where earth and sky meet mile away 
the flat monotony of the land clean of fencing be break by one spot only the roof of the division house on mere speck just dark than the ground house on four be not even in sight 
that be below the horizon 
as harran come up -PRON- see -PRON- mother at breakfast 
the table have be set on the porch and mrs derrick stir -PRON- coffee with one hand hold open with the other the page of walter marius 
at -PRON- foot princess nathalie the white angora cat sleek overfed selfcentred sit on -PRON- haunch industriously lick at the white fur of -PRON- breast while near at hand by the railing of the porch presley potter with a new bicycle lamp fill -PRON- with oil adjust the wick 
harran kiss -PRON- mother and sit down in a wicker chair on the porch remove -PRON- hat run -PRON- finger through -PRON- yellow hair 
magnus wife look hardly old enough to be the mother of two such big fellow as harran and lyman derrick 
-PRON- be not far into the fifty and -PRON- brown hair still retain much of -PRON- brightness 
-PRON- could yet be call pretty 
-PRON- eye be large and easily assume a look of inquiry and innocence such as one may expect to see in a young girl 
by disposition -PRON- be retire -PRON- easily obliterate -PRON- 
-PRON- be not make for the harshness of the world and yet -PRON- have know these harshness in -PRON- young day 
magnus have marry -PRON- when -PRON- be twentyone year old at a time when -PRON- be a graduate of some year stand from the state normal school and be teach literature music and penmanship in a seminary in the town of marysville 
-PRON- overwork -PRON- here continually loathe the strain of teaching yet cling to -PRON- with a tenacity bear of the knowledge that -PRON- be -PRON- only mean of support 
both -PRON- parent be dead -PRON- be dependent upon -PRON- 
-PRON- one ambition be to see italy and the bay of naple 
the marble faun madonna and il trovatore be -PRON- beau ideal of literature and art -PRON- dream of italy rome naple and the world great artcentre 
there be no doubt that -PRON- affair with magnu have be a lovematch but annie payne would have love any man who would have take -PRON- out of the droning heartbreake routine of the class and music room 
-PRON- have follow -PRON- fortune unquestioningly 
first at sacramento during the turmoil of -PRON- political career later on at placerville in el dorado county after derrick have interest -PRON- in the corpus christi group of mine and finally at los muertos where after sell out -PRON- fourth interest in corpus christi -PRON- have turn rancher and have come in on the new tract of wheat land just throw open by the railroad 
-PRON- have live here now for nearly ten year 
but never for one moment since the time -PRON- glance first lose -PRON- in the unbroken immensity of the ranch have -PRON- know a moment content 
continually there come into -PRON- pretty wideopen eye of a young look of uneasiness of distrust and aversion 
los muerto frighten -PRON- 
-PRON- remember the day of -PRON- young girlhood pass on a farm in eastern hundred acre neatly partition into the water lot the cow pasture the corn lot the barley field and wheat farm cosey comfortable homelike where the farmer love -PRON- land caress -PRON- coax -PRON- nourish -PRON- as though -PRON- be a thing almost conscious where the seed be sow by hand and a single twohorse plough be sufficient for the entire farm where the scythe suffice to cut the harvest and the grain be thrash with flail 
but this new order of ranch bound only by the horizon where as far as one could see to the north to the east to the south and to the west be all one hold a principality rule with iron and steam bully into a yield of three hundred and fifty thousand bushel where even when the land be rest unploughed unharrowed and unsown the wheat come -PRON- and even at time fill -PRON- with an undefinable terror 
to -PRON- mind there be something inordinate about -PRON- all something almost unnatural 
the direct brutality of ten thousand acre of wheat nothing but wheat as far as the eye could see stun -PRON- a little 
the onetime writingteacher of a young lady seminary with -PRON- pretty deerlike eye and delicate finger shrink from -PRON- 
-PRON- do not want to look at so much wheat 
there be something vaguely indecent in the sight this food of the people this elemental force this basic energy welter here under the sun in all the unconscious nakedness of a sprawl primordial titan 
the monotony of the ranch eat into -PRON- heart hour by hour year by year 
and with -PRON- all when be -PRON- to see rome italy and the bay of naple 
-PRON- be a different prospect truly 
magnus have give -PRON- -PRON- promise that once the ranch be well establish -PRON- two should travel 
but continually -PRON- have be oblige to put -PRON- off now for one reason now for another the machine would not as yet run of -PRON- -PRON- must still feel -PRON- hand upon the lever next year perhaps when wheat should go to ninety or the rain be good 
-PRON- do not insist 
-PRON- obliterate -PRON- only allow from time to time -PRON- pretty questioning eye to meet -PRON- 
in the meantime -PRON- retire within -PRON- 
-PRON- surround -PRON- with book 
-PRON- taste be of the delicacy of point lace 
-PRON- know -PRON- austin dobson by heart 
-PRON- read poem essay the idea of the seminary at marysville persist in -PRON- mind 
marius the epicurean the essay of elia sesame and lilie the stone of venice and the little toy magazine full of the flaccid banality of the minor poet be continually in -PRON- hand 
when presley have appear on los muertos -PRON- have welcome -PRON- arrival with delight 
here at last be a congenial spirit 
-PRON- look forward to long conversation with the young man on literature art and ethic 
but presley have disappoint -PRON- 
that of -PRON- few choose care little for literature shock -PRON- beyond word 
-PRON- indifference to style to elegant english be a positive affront 
-PRON- savage abuse and open ridicule of the neatly phrase rondeaux and sestina and chansonette of the little magazine be to -PRON- mind a wanton and uncalledfor cruelty 
-PRON- find -PRON- homer with -PRON- slaughter and hecatomb and barbaric feasting and headstrong passion violent and coarse 
-PRON- could not see with -PRON- any romance any poetry in the life around -PRON- -PRON- look to italy for that 
-PRON- song of the west which only once incoherent and fierce -PRON- have try to explain to -PRON- -PRON- swift tumultous life -PRON- truth -PRON- nobility and savagery -PRON- heroism and obscenity have revolt -PRON- 
but presley -PRON- have murmur that be not literature 
no -PRON- have cry between -PRON- tooth no thank god -PRON- be not 
a little later one of the stableman bring the buggy with the team of bay up to the step of the porch and harran put on a different coat and a black hat take -PRON- off to guadalajara 
the morning be fine there be no cloud in the sky but as buggy draw away from the grove of tree about the ranch house emerge into the open country on either side of the low road -PRON- catch -PRON- look sharply at the sky and the faint line of hill beyond the quien sabe ranch 
there be a certain indefinite cast to the landscape that to eye be not to be mistake 
rain the first of the season be not far off good -PRON- mutter touch the bay with the whip -PRON- canot get -PRON- plough to hand any too soon 
these ploughs magnus derrick have order from an eastern manufacturer some month before since -PRON- be dissatisfied with the result obtain from the one -PRON- have use hitherto which be of local make 
however there have be exasperate and unexpected delay in -PRON- shipment 
magnus and harran both have count upon have the plough in -PRON- implement barn that very week but a tracer send after -PRON- have only result in locate -PRON- still en route somewhere between the needle and bakersfield 
now there be likelihood of rain within the week 
plough could be undertake immediately afterward so soon as the ground be soften but there be a fair chance that the ranch would lie idle for want of proper machinery 
-PRON- be ten minute before train time when harran reach the depot at guadalajara 
the san francisco paper of the precede day have arrive on an early train 
-PRON- buy a couple from the station agent and look -PRON- over till a distant and prolong whistle announce the approach of the down train 
in one of the four passenger that alight from the train -PRON- recognise -PRON- father 
-PRON- half rise in -PRON- seat whistle shrilly between -PRON- tooth wave -PRON- hand and magnus derrick catch sight of -PRON- come forward quickly all of six foot tall and though now well toward -PRON- sixtieth year be as erect as an officer of cavalry 
-PRON- be broad in proportion a fine commanding figure impose an immediate respect impress one with a sense of gravity of dignity and a certain pride of race 
-PRON- be smoothshaven thinlippe with a broad chin and a prominent hawklike characteristic of the familythin with a high bridge such as one see in the later portrait of the duke of wellington 
-PRON- hair be thick and irongrey and have a tendency to curl in a forward direction just in front of -PRON- ear 
-PRON- wear a tophat of grey with a wide brim and a frock coat and carry a cane with a yellowed ivory head 
as a young man -PRON- have be -PRON- ambition to represent -PRON- native the united state senate 
calhoun be -PRON- great man but in two successive campaign -PRON- have be defeat 
-PRON- career check in this direction -PRON- have come to california in the fifty 
-PRON- have know and have be the intimate friend of such man as terry broderick general baker lick alvarado emerich larkin and above all of the unfortunate and misunderstood ralston 
once -PRON- have be put forward as the democratic candidate for governor but fail of election 
after this magnus have definitely abandon politic and have invest all -PRON- money in the corpus christi mine 
then -PRON- have sell out -PRON- interest at a small in time to miss -PRON- chance of become a multimillionaire in the comstock be look for reinvestment in other line when the news that wheat have be discover in california be pass from mouth to mouth 
practically -PRON- amount to a discovery 
dr first harvest of wheat in colusa county quietly undertake but suddenly realise with dramatic abruptness give a new matter for reflection to the think man of the new west 
california suddenly leap unheralded into the world market as a competitor in wheat production 
in a few year -PRON- output of wheat exceed the value of -PRON- output of gold and when later on the pacific and southwestern railroad throw open to settler the rich land of tulare to the corporation by the government as a bonus for the construction of the have be quick to seize the opportunity and have take up the ten thousand acre of los muertos 
wherever -PRON- have go magnu have take -PRON- family with -PRON- 
lyman have be bear at sacramento during the turmoil and excitement of campaign for governor and harran at shingle spring in el dorado county six year later 
but magnus be in every sense the prominent man 
in whatever circle -PRON- move -PRON- be the chief figure 
instinctively other man look to -PRON- as the leader 
-PRON- -PRON- be proud of this distinction -PRON- assume the grand manner very easily and carry -PRON- well 
as a public speaker -PRON- be one of the last of the follower of the old school of orator

when angry everybody around -PRON- tremble 
but -PRON- have not the genius for detail be not patient 
the certain grandiose lavishness of -PRON- disposition occupy -PRON- more with result than with mean 
-PRON- be always ready to take chance to hazard everything on the hope of colossal return 
in the mining day at placerville there be no more redoubtable poker player in the county

without know -PRON- -PRON- allow -PRON- to work -PRON- ranch much as if -PRON- be still work -PRON- mine 
the oldtime spirit of haphazard unscientific persist in -PRON- mind 
everything be a take the great chance be most apt to be the great winner 
the idea of manure los muertos of husband -PRON- great resource -PRON- would have scout as niggardly hebraic ungenerous 
magnus climb into the buggy help -PRON- with outstretche hand which -PRON- still hold 
the two be immensely fond of each other proud of each other 
-PRON- be constantly together and magnu keep no secret from -PRON- favourite son 
well boy 
well governor be very pleased -PRON- come -PRON- harran 
i fear that -PRON- may be too busy and send phelps 
-PRON- be thoughtful 
harran be about to reply but at that moment magnu catch sight of the three flat car load with brightpainted farming machine which still remain on the siding above the station 
-PRON- lay -PRON- hand on the rein and harran check the team 
harran observe magnu fix the machinery with a judicial frown harran those look singularly like -PRON- ploughs

the train have by this time go on -PRON- way and harran bring the team up to the siding 
ah i be right say the governor

magnus nod a grave approval 
that be shrewd boy 
as to the rain i think -PRON- be well informed -PRON- will have an early season 
the plough have arrive at a happy moment 
-PRON- mean money to -PRON- governor remark harran 
but as -PRON- turn the horse to allow -PRON- father to get into the buggy again the two be surprised to hear a thick throaty voice wish -PRON- goodmorne and turn about be aware of behrman who have come up while -PRON- be examine the ploughs eye flash on the instant and through -PRON- nostril -PRON- draw a sharp quick breath while a certain rigour of carriage stiffen the set of magnus shoulder and back 
magnus have not yet get into the buggy but stand with the team between -PRON- and behrman eye -PRON- calmly across the horse back 
behrman come around to the other side of the buggy and faced magnus 
-PRON- be a large fat man with a great stomach -PRON- cheek and the upper part of -PRON- thick neck run together to form a great tremulous jowl shaven and bluegrey in colour a roll of fat sprinkle with sparse hair moist with perspiration protrude over the back of -PRON- collar 
-PRON- wear a heavy black moustache 
on -PRON- head be a roundtopped hat of stiff brown straw highly varnish 
a lightbrown linen vest stamp with innumerable interlock horseshoe cover -PRON- protuberant stomach upon which a heavy watch chain of hollow link rise and fall with -PRON- difficult breathing clink against the vest button of imitation motherofpearl 
behrman be the banker of bonneville 
but besides this -PRON- be many other thing 
-PRON- be a real estate agent 
-PRON- buy grain -PRON- deal in mortgage 
-PRON- be one of the local political boss but more important than all this -PRON- be the representative of the pacific and southwestern railroad in that section of tulare county 
the railroad do little business in that part of the country that behrman do not supervise from the consignment of a shipment of wheat to the management of a damage suit or even to the repair and maintenance of the right of way 
during the time when the rancher of the county be fight the grainrate case behrman have be much in evidence in and about the san francisco court room and the lobby of the legislature in sacramento 
-PRON- have return to bonneville only recently a decision adverse to the rancher be foresee 
the position -PRON- occupy on the salary list of the pacific and southwestern could not readily be define for -PRON- be neither freight agent passenger agent attorney realestate broker nor political servant though -PRON- influence in all these office be undoubted and enormous 
but for all that the rancher about bonneville know whom to look to as a source of trouble 
there be no deny the fact that for osterman broderson annixter and derrick behrman be the railroad 
mr derrick goodmorne -PRON- cry as -PRON- come up 
harran 
glad to see -PRON- back mr derrick 
-PRON- hold out a thick hand 
magnus head and shoulder above the other tall thin erect look down upon behrman incline -PRON- head fail to see -PRON- extended hand sir -PRON- observe and wait for further speech 
well mr derrick continue behrman wipe the back of -PRON- neck with -PRON- handkerchief see in the city paper yesterday that -PRON- case have go against -PRON- guess -PRON- wasnot any great news to comment harran -PRON- face scarlet guess -PRON- know which way ulsteen be go to jump after -PRON- very first interview with -PRON- 
-PRON- donot like to be surprised in this sort of thing behrman 
now -PRON- know better than that harran remonstrate behrman blandly know what -PRON- mean to imply but i ainot go to let -PRON- make -PRON- get mad 
i want to say to -PRON- want to say to -PRON- mr one man to alone for the minute that -PRON- be on opposite side of the sorry -PRON- didnot win 
-PRON- side make a good fight but -PRON- be in a mistaken cause the whole trouble 
why -PRON- could have figure out before -PRON- ever go into the case that such rate be confiscation of property 
-PRON- must allow allow the fair interest on the investment 
-PRON- donot want -PRON- to go into the receiver hand do -PRON- now mr derrick 
the board of railroad commissioner be buy remark magnus sharply a keen brisk flash glinting in -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be part of the game put in harran for the railroad commission to cut rate to a ridiculous figure far below a figure just so that -PRON- be confiscation 
whether ulsteen be a tool of -PRON- or not -PRON- have to put the rate back to what -PRON- be originally 
if -PRON- enforce those rate mr harran return behrman calmly -PRON- wouldnot be able to earn sufficient money to meet operating expense or fix charge to say nothing of a surplus leave over to pay dividend tell -PRON- when the and ever pay dividend 
the low rate continue behrman that the legislature can establish must be such as will secure -PRON- a fair interest on -PRON- investment 
well what s -PRON- standard 
come let hear -PRON- 
who be to say what s a fair rate 
the railroad have -PRON- own notion of fairness sometimes 
the law of the state return behrman fix the rate of interest at seven per cent a good enough standard for -PRON- 
there be no reason mr harran why a dollar invest in a railroad should not earn as much as a dollar represent by a promissory per cent 
by apply -PRON- schedule of rate -PRON- would not earn a cent -PRON- would be bankrupt 
interest on -PRON- investment cry harran furious fine to talk about fair interest 
i know and -PRON- know that the total earning of the and main branch and lease line for last between nineteen and twenty million of dollar 
do -PRON- mean to say that twenty million dollar be seven per cent of the original cost of the road 
behrman spread out -PRON- hand smile 
that be the gross not the net how can -PRON- tell what be the original cost of the road 
ah that s just -PRON- shout harran emphasise each word with a blow of -PRON- fist upon -PRON- knee -PRON- eye sparkle -PRON- take curse good care that -PRON- donot know anything about the original cost of the road 
but -PRON- know -PRON- be bond for treble -PRON- value and -PRON- know this that the road have be build for fiftyfour thousand dollar per mile and that -PRON- -PRON- cost -PRON- eightyseven thousand 
-PRON- make a difference behrman on which of these two figure -PRON- be base -PRON- seven per cent 
that all may show obstinacy harran observe behrman vaguely but -PRON- donot show common sense 
-PRON- be thresh out old straw i believe gentleman remark magnus 
the question be thoroughly sift in the court 
quite right assented behrman 
the good way be that the railroad and the farmer understand each other and get along peaceably 
-PRON- be both dependent on each other 
-PRON- plough i believe mr derrick 
behrman nod toward the flat car 
-PRON- be consign to -PRON- admit magnus 
-PRON- look a trifle like rain observed behrman ease -PRON- neck and jowl in -PRON- limp collar suppose -PRON- will want to begin plough next week 
possibly say magnu see that -PRON- plough be hurry through for -PRON- then mr derrick 
-PRON- will route -PRON- by fast freight for -PRON- and -PRON- wonot cost -PRON- anything extra 
what do -PRON- mean demand harran 
the plough be here 
-PRON- have nothing more to do with the railroad 
i be go to have -PRON- wagon down here this afternoon be sorry answer behrman but the car be go north not as -PRON- think come the north 
-PRON- have not be to san francisco yet 
magnus make a slight movement of the head as one who remember a fact hitherto forget 
but harran be as yet unenlightene 
to san francisco -PRON- answer -PRON- want -PRON- be -PRON- talk about 
well -PRON- know of course the regulation answer behrman 
freight of this kind come from the eastern point into the state must go first to one of -PRON- common point and be reshippe from there 
harran do remember now but never before have the matter so strike home 
-PRON- lean back in -PRON- seat in dumb amazement for the instant 
even magnu have turn a little pale 
then abruptly harran break out violent and rage 
what next 
-PRON- god why donot -PRON- break into -PRON- house at night 
why donot -PRON- steal the watch out of -PRON- pocket steal the horse out of the harness hold -PRON- up with a shotgun yes stand and deliver -PRON- money or -PRON- life 
here -PRON- bring -PRON- plough from the east over -PRON- line but -PRON- be not content with -PRON- longhaul rate between eastern point and bonneville 
-PRON- want to get -PRON- under -PRON- ruinous shorthaul rate between bonneville and san francisco think of -PRON- a load of stuff for bonneville that canot stop at bonneville where -PRON- be consign but have get to go up to san francisco first bonneville at forty cent per ton and then be reshippe from san francisco back to bonneville again at cent per ton the shorthaul rate 
and -PRON- have to pay -PRON- all or go without 
here be the plough right here in sight of the land -PRON- have get to be use on the season just ready for -PRON- and -PRON- canot touch -PRON- 
oh -PRON- exclaim in deep disgust -PRON- a pretty mess -PRON- a farce the whole dirty business 
behrman listen to -PRON- unmove -PRON- little eye blink under -PRON- fat forehead the gold chain of hollow link click against the pearl button of -PRON- waistcoat as -PRON- breathe 
-PRON- donot do any good to let loose like that harran -PRON- say at length be willing to do what i can for -PRON- hurry the ploughs through but i canot change the freight regulation of the road -PRON- blackmail for this vociferate harran 
how much do -PRON- want to let -PRON- go 
how much have -PRON- get to pay -PRON- to be to use -PRON- own -PRON- figure 
come spit -PRON- out see -PRON- be try to make -PRON- angry harran return behrman but -PRON- wonot succeed 
better give up try -PRON- boy 
as i say the good way be to have the railroad and the farmer get along amicably 
-PRON- be the only way -PRON- can do business 
well slong governor i must trot along 
harran 
-PRON- take -PRON- off 
but before leave guadalajara magnus drop into the town small grocery store to purchase a box of cigar of a certain mexican brand unprocurable elsewhere 
harran remain in the buggy 
while -PRON- wait dyke appear at the end of the street and see young son come over to shake hand with -PRON- 
-PRON- explain -PRON- affair with the and and ask the young man what -PRON- think of the expect rise in the price of hop 
hop ought to be a good thing harran tell -PRON- 
the crop in germany and in new york have be a dead failure for the last three year and so many people have go out of the business that there s likely to be a shortage and a stiff advance in the price 
-PRON- ought to go to a dollar next year 
sure hop ought to be a good thing the old lady and sidney dyke 
why fairly well thank -PRON- harran up to sacramento just now to see -PRON- brother 
i be think of go in with -PRON- brother into this hop business 
but i have a letter from -PRON- this morning 
-PRON- may not be able to meet -PRON- on this proposition get other business on hand 
if -PRON- pull -PRON- probably have to go -PRON- alone but have to borrow 
i have think with -PRON- money and mine -PRON- would have enough to pull off the affair without mortgage anything 
as -PRON- be i guess have to see behrman be curse if i would exclaim harran 
well behrman be a screw admit the engineer and -PRON- be railroad to -PRON- boot but business be business and -PRON- would have to stand by a contract in black and white and this chance in hop be too good to let slide 
i guess well try -PRON- on harran 
i can get a good foreman that know all about hop just now and if the deal payswell i want to send sid to a seminary up in san francisco 
well mortgage the crop but donot mortgage the homestead dyke say harran 
and by the way have -PRON- look up the freight rate on hop 
no i havenot yet answer dyke and i have well be sure of that hadnot i hear that the rate be reasonable though 
-PRON- be sure to have a clear understanding with the railroad first about the rate harran warn -PRON- 
when magnu come out of the grocery store and once more seat -PRON- in the buggy -PRON- say to harran boy drive over here to before -PRON- start home 
i want to ask -PRON- to dine with -PRON- tonight 
osterman and broderson be to drop in i believe and i should like to have annixter as well 
magnus be lavishly hospitable 
los door invariably stand open to all the derrick neighbour and once in so often magnus have a few of -PRON- intimate to dinner 
as harran and -PRON- father drive along the road toward ranch house magnus ask about what have happen during -PRON- absence 
-PRON- inquire after -PRON- wife and the ranch comment upon the work on the irrigate ditch 
harran give -PRON- the news of the past week discharge -PRON- resolve to raise a crop of hop return the killing of the sheep and petition to remain upon the ranch as tenant 
-PRON- need only recommendation that the german should remain to have magnu consent upon the instant 
-PRON- know more about -PRON- than boy -PRON- say and whatever -PRON- think be wise shall be do 
harran touch the bay with the whip urge -PRON- to -PRON- brisk pace 
-PRON- be not yet at and -PRON- be anxious to get back to the ranch house to supervise the bluestoning of -PRON- seed 
by the way governor -PRON- demand suddenly how be lyman get on 
lyman eld son have never take kindly toward ranch life 
-PRON- resemble -PRON- mother more than -PRON- do magnus and have inherit from -PRON- a distaste for agriculture and a tendency toward a profession 
at a time when harran be learn the rudiment of farm lyman be enter the state university and graduate thence have spend three year in the study of law 
but later on trait that be particularly -PRON- father develop 
politic interest -PRON- 
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be a bear politician be diplomatic approachable have a talent for intrigue a gift of make friend easily and most indispensable of all a veritable genius for put influential man under obligation to -PRON- 
already -PRON- have succeed in gain for -PRON- two important office in the municipal administration of san -PRON- have -PRON- attorney and later on assistant district attorney 
but with these small achievement -PRON- be by no means satisfied 
the largeness of -PRON- father character modify in lyman by a counterinfluence of selfishness have produce in -PRON- an inordinate ambition 
where -PRON- father during -PRON- political career have consider -PRON- only as an exponent of principle -PRON- strive to apply lyman see but the office -PRON- own personal aggrandisement 
-PRON- belong to the new school wherein object be attain not by oration before senate and assembly but by session of committee caucus compromise and expedient 
-PRON- goal be to be in fact what magnus be only in namegovernor 
lyman with shut tooth have resolve that some day -PRON- would sit in the gubernatorial chair in sacramento 
lyman be do well answer magnus could wish -PRON- be more pronounced in -PRON- conviction less willing to compromise but i believe -PRON- to be earnest and to have a talent for government and civic 
-PRON- ambition do -PRON- credit and if -PRON- occupy -PRON- a little more with mean and a little less with end -PRON- would i be sure be the ideal servant of the people 
but i be not afraid 
the time will come when the state will be proud of -PRON- 
as harran turn the team into the driveway that lead up to house magnus remark harran isnot that young annixter -PRON- on the porch 
harran nod and remark by the way governor i wouldnot seem too cordial in -PRON- invitation to annixter 
-PRON- will be glad to come i know but if -PRON- seem to want -PRON- too much -PRON- be just like -PRON- confound obstinacy to make objection 
there be something in that observe magnus as harran draw up at the porch of the house 
-PRON- be a queer crossgrained fellow but in many way sterling 
annixter be lie in the hammock on the porch precisely as presley have find -PRON- the day before read david copperfield and stuff -PRON- with dry prune 
when -PRON- recognise magnus however -PRON- get up though careful to give evidence of the most poignant discomfort 
-PRON- explain -PRON- difficulty at great length protest that -PRON- stomach be no well than a spongebag 
would magnus and harran get down and have a drink 
there be whiskey somewhere about 
magnus however decline 
-PRON- state -PRON- errand ask annixter to come over to los muerto that evening for seven oclock dinner 
osterman and broderson would be there 
at once annixter even to surprise put -PRON- chin in the air make excuse fear to compromise -PRON- if -PRON- accept too readily 
no -PRON- do not think -PRON- could get sure of -PRON- in fact 
there be certain business -PRON- have on hand that evening 
-PRON- have practically make an appointment with a man at bonneville then too -PRON- be think of go up to san francisco tomorrow and need -PRON- sleep would go to bed early and besides all that -PRON- be a very sick man -PRON- stomach be out of whack if -PRON- move about -PRON- bring the gripe back 
no -PRON- must get along without -PRON- 
magnus know with whom -PRON- have to deal do not urge the point be convince that annixter would argue over the affair the rest of the morning 
-PRON- resettle -PRON- in the buggy and harran gather up the rein 
well -PRON- observe -PRON- know -PRON- business good 
come if -PRON- can 
-PRON- dine at seven hear -PRON- be go to farm the whole of los muerto this season remark annixter with a certain note of challenge in -PRON- voice 
-PRON- be think of -PRON- reply magnus 
annixter grunt scornfully 
do -PRON- get the message i send -PRON- by presley -PRON- begin 
tactless blunt and direct annixter be quite capable of call even magnus a fool to -PRON- face 
but before -PRON- could proceed behrman in -PRON- single buggy turn into the gate and drive leisurely up to the porch halt on the other side of team gentleman -PRON- remark nodding to the two derrick as though -PRON- have not see -PRON- earlier in the day 
mr annixter how do -PRON- do 
what in hell do want demand annixter with a stare 
behrman hiccough slightly and pass a fat hand over -PRON- waistcoat 
why not very much mr annixter -PRON- reply ignore the belligerency in the young ranchman voice but i will have to lodge a protest against -PRON- mr annixter in the matter of keep -PRON- line fence in repair 
the sheep be all over the track last night this side the long trestle and i be afraid -PRON- have seriously disturb -PRON- ballast along there fence along -PRON- right of way 
the farmer have the prescriptive right of that so -PRON- have to look to -PRON- to keep -PRON- fence in repair 
i be sorry but i shall have to protest annixter return to the hammock and stretch -PRON- out in -PRON- to -PRON- full length remark tranquilly go to the devil 
-PRON- be as much to -PRON- interest as to -PRON- that the safety of the public -PRON- hear what i say 
go to the devil 
that all may show obstinacy mr annixter but suddenly annixter jump up again and come to the edge of the porch -PRON- face flame scarlet to the root of -PRON- stiff yellow hair 
-PRON- thrust out -PRON- jaw aggressively clench -PRON- tooth 
-PRON- -PRON- vociferate tell -PRON- what -PRON- be 
to -PRON- mind -PRON- be the last insult the most outrageous calumny 
-PRON- have no bad epithet at -PRON- command show obstinacy pursue behrman bent upon finish the phrase but -PRON- donot show common sense mend -PRON- fence and then again maybe i wonot mend -PRON- fence shout annixter know what -PRON- wild engine last night 
well -PRON- have no right to run at that speed in the town limit 
how the town limit 
the sheep be this side the long trestle 
well that s in the town limit of guadalajara 
why mr annixter the long trestle be a good two mile out of guadalajara 
annixter square -PRON- leap to the chance of an argument 
two mile not a mile and a quarter 
no -PRON- not a mile leave -PRON- to magnus here 
oh i know nothing about -PRON- declare magnu refuse to be involve 
yes -PRON- do 
yes -PRON- do too 
any fool know how far -PRON- be from guadalajara to the long trestle about fiveeighth of a mile 
from the depot of the town remark behrman placidly to the head of the long trestle be about two mile a lie and -PRON- know -PRON- a lie shout the other furious at calmness and i can prove -PRON- a lie walk that distance on the upper road and i know just how fast i walk and if i can walk four mile in one hour 
magnus and harran drive on leave annixter try to draw behrman into a wrangle 
when at length behrman as well take -PRON- away annixter return to -PRON- hammock finish the rest of -PRON- prune and read another chapter of copperfield 
then -PRON- put the book open over -PRON- face and go to sleep 
an hour later toward noon -PRON- own terrific snoring wake -PRON- up suddenly and -PRON- sit up rub -PRON- face and blink at the sunlight 
there be a bad taste in -PRON- mouth from sleep with -PRON- wide open and go into the diningroom of the house -PRON- mix -PRON- a drink of whiskey and soda and swallow -PRON- in three great gulp 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- feel not only better but hungry and press an electric button in the wall near the sideboard three time to let the in a separate building near the ranch that -PRON- be ready for -PRON- dinner 
as -PRON- do so an idea occur to -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder if hilma tree would bring up -PRON- dinner and wait on the table while -PRON- eat -PRON- 
in connection with -PRON- ranch annixter run a dairy farm on a very small scale make just enough butter and cheese for the consumption of the ranchs old man tree -PRON- wife and -PRON- daughter hilma look after the dairy 
but there be not always work enough to keep the three of -PRON- occupy and hilma at time make -PRON- useful in other way 
as often as not -PRON- lend a hand in the kitchen and two or three time a week -PRON- take -PRON- mother place in look after house make the bed put -PRON- room to right bring -PRON- meal up from the kitchen 
for the last summer -PRON- have be away visit with relative in one of the town on the coast 
but the week previous to this -PRON- have return and annixter have come upon -PRON- suddenly one day in the dairy make cheese the sleeve of -PRON- crisp blue shirt waist roll back to -PRON- very shoulder 
annixter have carry away with -PRON- a clearcut recollection of these smooth white arm of her bare to the shoulder very round and cool and fresh 
-PRON- would not have believe that a girl so young should have have arm so big and perfect 
to -PRON- surprise -PRON- find -PRON- think of -PRON- after -PRON- have go to bed that night and in the morning when -PRON- wake -PRON- be bother to know whether -PRON- have dream about fine white arm over night 
then abruptly -PRON- have lose patience with -PRON- for be so occupied with the subject raging and furious with all the breed of fine way for a man to waste -PRON- time 
-PRON- have have -PRON- experience with the timid little creature in the glovecleaning establishment in sacramento 
that be enough 
feemale 
rot 
none of -PRON- in thank -PRON- have see hilma tree give -PRON- a look in the dairy 
aha -PRON- see through -PRON- 
-PRON- be try to get a hold on -PRON- be -PRON- 
-PRON- would show -PRON- 
wait till -PRON- see -PRON- again 
-PRON- would send -PRON- about -PRON- business in a hurry 
-PRON- resolve upon a terrible demeanour in the presence of the dairy great show of indifference a fierce masculine nonchalance and when the next morning -PRON- bring -PRON- -PRON- breakfast -PRON- have be smite dumb as soon as -PRON- enter the room glue -PRON- eye upon -PRON- plate -PRON- elbow close to -PRON- side awkward clumsy overwhelm with constraint 
while true to -PRON- conviction as a womanhat and genuinely despise hilma both as a girl and as an inferior the idea of -PRON- worry -PRON- 
most of all -PRON- be angry with -PRON- because of -PRON- inane sheepishness when -PRON- be about 
-PRON- at first have tell -PRON- that -PRON- be a fool not to be able to ignore -PRON- existence as hitherto and then that -PRON- be a great fool not to take advantage of -PRON- position 
certainly -PRON- have not the remote idea of any affection but hilma be a fine look girl 
-PRON- imagine an affair with -PRON- 
as -PRON- reflect upon the matter now scowl abstractedly at the button of the electric bell turn the whole business over in -PRON- mind -PRON- remember that today be buttermake day and that mrs tree would be occupy in the dairy 
that mean that hilma would take -PRON- place 
-PRON- turn to the mirror of the sideboard scrutinise -PRON- reflection with grim disfavour 
after a moment rub the roughen surface of -PRON- chin the wrong way -PRON- mutter to -PRON- image in the glass that a mug 
good lord what a look mug 
then after a moment silence wonder if that fool feemale will be up here today 
-PRON- cross over into -PRON- bedroom and peep around the edge of the lower curtain 
the window look out upon the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well and the cookhouse and dairyhouse close beside -PRON- 
as -PRON- watch -PRON- see hilma come out from the cookhouse and hurry across toward the kitchen 
evidently -PRON- be go to see about -PRON- dinner 
but as -PRON- pass by the artesian well -PRON- meet young delaney one of hand come up the trail by the irrigating ditch lead -PRON- horse toward the stable a great coil of barbed wire in -PRON- gloved hand and a pair of nipper thrust into -PRON- belt 
no doubt -PRON- have be mend the break in the line fence by the long trestle 
annixter see -PRON- take off -PRON- widebrimmed hat as -PRON- meet hilma and the two stand there for some moment talk together 
annixter even hear hilma laugh very gayly at something delaney be say 
-PRON- pat -PRON- horse neck affectionately and delaney draw the nipper from -PRON- belt make as if to pinch -PRON- arm with -PRON- 
-PRON- catch at -PRON- wrist and push -PRON- away laugh again 
to mind the pair seem astonishingly intimate 
brusquely -PRON- anger flame up 
ah that be -PRON- be -PRON- 
delaney and hilma have an understanding between -PRON- 
-PRON- carry on -PRON- affair right out there in the open under -PRON- very eye 
-PRON- be absolutely disgusting 
have -PRON- no sense of decency those two 
well this end -PRON- 
-PRON- would stop that sort of thing short off none of that on ranch if -PRON- know -PRON- 
no sir 
-PRON- would pack that girl off before -PRON- be a day old 
-PRON- wouldnot have that kind about the place 
not much have to get out 
-PRON- would talk to old man tree about -PRON- this afternoon 
whatever happen insist upon morality 
and -PRON- dinner -PRON- suddenly exclaim get to wait and go maybe get sick -PRON- carry on -PRON- disgusting lovemaking 
-PRON- turn about on the instant and stride over to the electric bell rang -PRON- again with all -PRON- might 
when that feemale get up here -PRON- declare just find out why get to wait like this take -PRON- down to the taste lenient enough lord know but i donot propose to be impose upon the time 
a few moment later while annixter be pretend to read the county newspaper by the window in the diningroom hilma come in to set the table 
at the time annixter have -PRON- foot cock on the window ledge and be smoke a cigar but as soon as -PRON- enter the room -PRON- foot down to the floor and crush out the light tip of -PRON- cigar under the window ledge 
over the top of the paper -PRON- glance at -PRON- covertly from time to time 
though hilma be only nineteen year old -PRON- be a large girl with all the development of a much old woman 
there be a certain generous amplitude to the full round curve of -PRON- hip and shoulder that suggest the precocious maturity of a healthy vigorous animal life pass under the hot southern sun of a halftropical country 
-PRON- be one know at a glance warmbloode fullbloode with an even comfortable balance of temperament 
-PRON- neck be thick and slope to -PRON- shoulder with full beautiful curve and under -PRON- chin and under -PRON- ear the flesh be as white and smooth as floss satin shade exquisitely to a faint delicate brown on -PRON- nape at the root of -PRON- hair 
-PRON- throat round to meet -PRON- chin and cheek with a soft swell of the skin tint pale amber in the shadow but blend by barely perceptible gradation to the sweet warm flush of -PRON- cheek 
this colour on -PRON- temple be just touch with a certain blueness where the flesh be thin over the fine veining underneath 
-PRON- eye be light brown and so wide open that on the slight provocation the full disc of the pupil be disclose the a fraction of a shade dark than the hue of -PRON- edge with lash that be almost black 
while these lash be not long -PRON- be thick and rim -PRON- eye with a fine thin line 
-PRON- mouth be rather large the lip shut tight and nothing could have be more graceful more charming than the outline of these full lip of her and -PRON- round white chin modulate downward with a certain delicious roundness to -PRON- neck -PRON- throat and the sweet feminine amplitude of -PRON- breast 
the slight movement of -PRON- head and shoulder send a gentle undulation through all this beauty of soft outline and smooth surface the delicate amber shadow deepen or fade or lose -PRON- imperceptibly in the pretty rosecolour of -PRON- cheek or the dark warmtinte shadow of -PRON- thick brown hair 
-PRON- hair seem almost to have a life of -PRON- own almost thick glossy and moist lie in heavy sweetsmelling masse over -PRON- forehead over -PRON- small ear with -PRON- pink lobe and far down upon -PRON- nape 
deep in between the coil and braid -PRON- be of a bituman brownness but in the sunlight -PRON- vibrate with a sheen like tarnish gold 
like most large girl -PRON- movement be not hurry and this indefinite deliberateness of gesture this slow grace this certain ease of attitude be a charm that be all -PRON- own 
but great charm of all be -PRON- simplicity that be not only in the calm regularity of -PRON- face with -PRON- statuesque evenness of contour -PRON- broad surface of cheek and forehead and the masse of -PRON- straight smooth hair but be apparent as well in the long line of -PRON- carriage from -PRON- foot to -PRON- waist and the single deep swell from -PRON- waist to -PRON- shoulder 
almost unconsciously -PRON- dress in harmony with this note of simplicity and on this occasion wear a skirt of plain dark blue calico and a white shirt waist crisp from the laundry 
and yet for all the dignity of this rigourous simplicity there be about hilma small contradictory suggestion of feminine daintiness charming beyond word 
even annixter could not help notice that -PRON- foot be narrow and slender and that the little steel buckle of -PRON- low shoe be polish bright and that -PRON- fingertip and nail be of a fine rosy pink 
-PRON- find -PRON- wonder how -PRON- be that a girl in position should be able to keep -PRON- so pretty so trim so clean and feminine but -PRON- reflect that -PRON- work be chiefly in the dairy and even there of the light order 
-PRON- be on the ranch more for the sake of be with -PRON- parent than from any necessity of employment 
vaguely -PRON- seem to understand that in that great new land of the west in the openair healthy life of the ranch where the condition of earn a livelihood be of the easy refinement among the young woman be easily to be the refinement of education nor culture but the natural intuitive refinement of the woman not as yet defile and crush out by the sordid strenuous lifestruggle of overpopulated district 
-PRON- be the original intend and natural delicacy of an elemental existence close to nature close to life close to the great kindly earth 
as hilma lay the tablespread -PRON- arm open to -PRON- wide reach the white cloth set a little glisten of reflect light underneath the chin annixter stir in -PRON- place uneasily 
oh -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- miss hilma -PRON- remark for the sake of say something 
how do -PRON- do sir -PRON- answer look up rest for a moment on -PRON- outspread palm hope -PRON- be well 
-PRON- voice be low in pitch and of a velvety huskiness seem to come more from -PRON- chest than from -PRON- throat 
well some better growled annixter 
then suddenly -PRON- demand that dog 
a decrepit irish setter sometimes make -PRON- appearance in and about the ranch house sleep under the bed and eat when anyone about the place think to give -PRON- a plate of bread 
annixter have no particular interest in the dog 
for week at a time -PRON- ignore -PRON- existence 
-PRON- be not -PRON- dog 
but today -PRON- seem as if -PRON- could not let the subject rest 
for no reason that -PRON- could explain even to -PRON- -PRON- recur to -PRON- continually 
-PRON- question hilma minutely all about the dog 
who own -PRON- 
how old do -PRON- think -PRON- be 
do -PRON- imagine the dog be sick 
where have -PRON- get to 
maybe -PRON- have crawl off to die somewhere 
-PRON- recur to the subject all through the meal apparently -PRON- could talk of nothing else and as -PRON- finally go away after clear off the table -PRON- go onto the porch and call after -PRON- say miss hilma 
yes sir 
if that dog turn up again -PRON- let -PRON- know 
very well sir 
annixter return to the diningroom and sit down in the chair -PRON- have just vacate 
to hell with the dog -PRON- mutter enrage -PRON- could not tell why 
when at length -PRON- allow -PRON- attention to wander from hilma tree -PRON- find that -PRON- have be stare fixedly at a thermometer upon the wall opposite and this make -PRON- think that -PRON- have long be -PRON- intention to buy a fine barometer an instrument that could be accurately depend on 
but the barometer suggest the present condition of the weather and the likelihood of rain 
in such case much be to be do in the way of get the seed ready and overhaul -PRON- plough and drill 
-PRON- have not be away from the house in two day 
-PRON- be time to be up and do 
-PRON- determine to put in the afternoon take a look around and have a late supper 
-PRON- would not go to los muertos -PRON- would ignore magnus invitation 
possibly though -PRON- may be well to run over and see what be up 
if i do -PRON- say to -PRON- ride the buckskin 
the buckskin be a halfbroken broncho that fight like a fiend under the saddle until the quirt and spur bring -PRON- to -PRON- sense 
but annixter remember that the tree cottage next the dairyhouse look out upon the stable and perhaps hilma would see -PRON- while -PRON- be mount the horse and be impress with -PRON- courage 
huh grunted annixter under -PRON- breath should like to see that fool delaney try to bust that bronch what like to see 
however as annixter step from the porch of the ranch house -PRON- be surprised to notice a grey haze over all the sky the sunlight be go there be a sense of coolness in the air the weathervane on the fine golden trotting horse with flamboyant mane and veer in a southwest wind 
evidently the expect rain be close at hand 
annixter cross over to the stable reflect that -PRON- could ride the buckskin to the tree cottage and tell hilma that -PRON- would not be home to supper 
the conference at los muertos would be an admirable excuse for this and upon the spot -PRON- resolve to go over to the derrick ranch house after all 
as -PRON- pass the tree cottage -PRON- observe with satisfaction that hilma be go to and fro in the front room 
if -PRON- bust the buckskin in the yard before the stable -PRON- could not help but see 
annixter find the stableman in the back of the barn grease the axle of the buggy and order -PRON- to put the saddle on the buckskin 
why i donot think -PRON- s here sir answer the stableman glance into the stall 
no i remember now 
delaney take -PRON- out just after dinner 
-PRON- other horse go lame and -PRON- want to go down by the long trestle to mend the fence 
-PRON- start out but have to come back 
oh delaney get -PRON- do -PRON- 
yes sir 
-PRON- have a circus with -PRON- but -PRON- bust -PRON- right enough 
when -PRON- come to horse delaney can wipe the eye of any cowpuncher in the county i guess 
-PRON- can can -PRON- observe annixter 
then after a silence well all right billy put -PRON- saddle on whatever -PRON- have get here go over to los muerto this afternoon 
want to look out for the rain mr annixter remark billy 
guess well have rain before night take a rubber coat answer annixter 
bring the horse up to the ranch house when -PRON- be ready 
annixter return to the house to look for -PRON- rubber coat in deep disgust not permit -PRON- to glance toward the dairyhouse and the tree cottage 
but as -PRON- reach the porch -PRON- hear the telephone ring -PRON- call 
-PRON- be presley who rang up from los muertos 
-PRON- have hear from harran that annixter be perhaps come over that evening 
if -PRON- come would -PRON- mind bring over -PRON- have leave -PRON- at the quien sabe ranch the day before and have forget to come back that way for -PRON- 
well objected annixter a surly note in -PRON- voice go to over 
oh never mind then return presley easily be to blame for forget -PRON- bother about -PRON- come over some of these day and get -PRON- -PRON- 
annixter hang up the transmitter with a vehement wrench and stamp out of the room bang the door 
-PRON- find -PRON- rubber coat hang in the hallway and swing into -PRON- with a fierce movement of the shoulder that all but start the seam 
everything seem to conspire to thwart -PRON- 
-PRON- be just like that absentminde crazy poet presley to forget -PRON- wheel 
well -PRON- could come after -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- annixter would ride horse anyhow 
when -PRON- come out upon the porch -PRON- see the wheel lean against the fence where presley have leave -PRON- 
if -PRON- stay there much longer the rain would catch -PRON- 
annixter rip out an oath 
at every moment -PRON- illhumour be increase 
yet for all that -PRON- go back to the stable push the bicycle before -PRON- and countermand -PRON- order direct the stableman to get the buggy ready 
-PRON- -PRON- carefully stow bicycle under the seat cover -PRON- with a couple of empty sack and a tarpaulin carriage cover 
while -PRON- be do this the stableman utter an exclamation and pause in the act of back the horse into the shaft hold up a hand listening 
from the hollow roof of the barn and from the thick velvetlike padding of dust over the ground outside and from among the leave of the few nearby tree and plant there come a vast monotonous murmur that seem to issue from all quarter of the horizon at once a prolonged and subdue rustle sound steady even persistent -PRON- rain announce the stableman 
the first of the season 
and i get to be out in -PRON- fume annixter and i suppose those swine will quit work on the big barn now 
when the buggy be finally ready -PRON- put on -PRON- rubber coat climb in and without wait for the stableman to raise the top drive out into the rain a newlit cigar in -PRON- tooth 
as -PRON- pass the dairyhouse -PRON- see hilma stand in the doorway hold out -PRON- hand to the rain -PRON- face turn upward toward the grey sky amuse and interested at this first shower of the wet season 
-PRON- be so absorbed that -PRON- do not see annixter and -PRON- clumsy nod in -PRON- direction pass unnoticed 
-PRON- do -PRON- on purpose annixter tell -PRON- chew fiercely on -PRON- cigar 
cut -PRON- now hey 
well this settle -PRON- 
-PRON- leave this ranch before a day old 
-PRON- decide that -PRON- would put off -PRON- tour of inspection till the next day 
travel in the buggy as -PRON- do -PRON- must keep to the road which lead to in very roundabout fashion by way of guadalajara 
this rain would reduce the thick dust of the road to two foot of viscid mud 
-PRON- would take -PRON- quite three hour to reach the ranch house on los muertos 
-PRON- think of delaney and the buckskin and grind -PRON- tooth 
and all this trouble if -PRON- please because of a fool feemale girl 
a fine way for -PRON- to waste -PRON- time 
well now -PRON- be do with -PRON- 
-PRON- decision be take now 
-PRON- should pack 
steadily the rain increase 
there be no wind 
the thick veil of wet descend straight from sky to earth blur distant outline spread a vast sheen of grey over all the landscape 
-PRON- volume become great the prolonged murmuring note take on a deep tone 
at the gate to the road which lead across hopfield toward guadalajara annixter be oblige to descend and raise the top of the buggy 
in do so -PRON- catch the flesh of -PRON- hand in the joint of the iron elbow that support the top and pinch -PRON- cruelly 
-PRON- be the last misery the culmination of a long train of wretchedness 
on the instant -PRON- hate hilma tree so fiercely that -PRON- sharply set tooth all but bite -PRON- cigar in two 
while -PRON- be grab and wrench at the buggytop the water from -PRON- hat brim drip down upon -PRON- nose the horse restive under the drench of the rain move uneasily -PRON- -PRON- shout inarticulate with exasperation wait till i get hold of -PRON- -PRON- 
but there be an interruption 
delaney ride the buckskin come around a bend in the road at a slow trot and annixter get into the buggy again find -PRON- face to face with -PRON- 
why hello mr annixter say -PRON- pull up 
kind of sort of wet isnot -PRON- 
annixter -PRON- face suddenly scarlet sit back in -PRON- place abruptly exclaim there -PRON- be be -PRON- be down there explain delaney with a motion of -PRON- head toward the railroad to mend that break in the fence by the long trestle and i think while i be about -PRON- follow down along the fence toward guadalajara to see if there be any more break 
but i guess -PRON- all right 
oh -PRON- guess -PRON- all right do -PRON- observed annixter through -PRON- tooth return the other bewilder at the truculent ring in voice mend that break by the long trestle just now why didnot -PRON- mend -PRON- a week ago shout annixter wrathfully be look for -PRON- all the morning i have and who tell -PRON- -PRON- could take that buckskin 
and the sheep be all over the right of way last night because of that break and here that filthy pip behrman come down here this morning and want to make trouble for -PRON- 
suddenly -PRON- cry out what do i -PRON- for 
what do i keep -PRON- around here for 
think -PRON- just to fatten up -PRON- carcass hey 
why mr annixter begin delaney 
and donot to -PRON- vociferate the other excite -PRON- with -PRON- own noise -PRON- say a word to -PRON- even to apologise 
if speak to -PRON- once about that break speak fifty time 
why sir declare delaney beginning to get indignant the sheep do -PRON- -PRON- last night tell -PRON- not to to -PRON- clamoured annixter 
but say look here get off the ranch 
-PRON- get off the ranch 
and take that buckskin against -PRON- express order 
i wonot have -PRON- kind about the place not much easygoing enough lord know but i donot propose to be impose on the time 
pack off -PRON- understand and do -PRON- lively 
go to the foreman and tell -PRON- i tell -PRON- to pay -PRON- off and then clear out 
and -PRON- hear -PRON- -PRON- conclude with a menacing outthrust of -PRON- low jaw -PRON- hear -PRON- if i catch -PRON- hang around the ranch house after this or if i so much as see -PRON- on quien sabe show -PRON- the way off of -PRON- -PRON- friend at the toe of -PRON- boot 
now then get out of the way and let -PRON- pass 
angry beyond the power of retort delaney drive the spur into the buckskin and pass the buggy in a single bound 
annixter gather up the rein and drive on mutter to -PRON- and occasionally look back to observe the buckskin fly toward the ranch house in a spattering shower of mud delaney urge -PRON- on -PRON- head bend down against the fall rain 
huh grunted annixter with grim satisfaction a certain sense of good humour at length return to -PRON- that just about take the saleratus out of dough -PRON- friend 
a little farther on annixter get out of the buggy a second time to open another gate that let -PRON- out upon the upper road not far distant from guadalajara 
-PRON- be the road that connect that town with bonneville and that run parallel with the railroad track 
on the other side of the track -PRON- could see the infinite extension of the brown bare land of los muerto turn now to a soft moist welter of fertility under the insistent caressing of the rain 
the hard sunbaked clod be decompose the crevice between drink the wet with an eager sucking noise 
but the prospect be dreary the distant horizon be blot under drift mist of rain the eternal monotony of the earth lie open to the sombre low sky without a single adornment without a single variation from -PRON- melancholy flatness 
near at hand the wire between the telegraph pole vibrate with a faint humming under the multitudinous fingering of the myriad of fall drop strike among -PRON- and drip off steadily from one to another 
the pole -PRON- be dark and swollen and glisten with wet while the little cone of glass on the transverse bar reflect the dull grey light of the end of the afternoon 
as annixter be about to drive on a freight train pass come from guadalajara go northward toward bonneville fresno and san francisco 
-PRON- be a long train move slowly methodically with a measure coughing of -PRON- locomotive and a rhythmic cadence of -PRON- truck over the interstice of the rail 
on two or three of the flat car near -PRON- end annixter plainly see magnus ploughs -PRON- bright coating of red and green paint set a single brilliant note in all this array of grey and brown 
annixter halt watch the train file past carry plough away from -PRON- ranch at this very time of the first rain when -PRON- would be most need 
-PRON- watch -PRON- silent thoughtful and without articulate comment 
even after -PRON- pass -PRON- sit in -PRON- place a long time watch -PRON- lose -PRON- slowly in the distance -PRON- prolonged rumble diminish to a faint murmur 
soon -PRON- hear the engine sound -PRON- whistle for the long trestle 
but the moving train no longer carry with -PRON- that impression of terror and destruction that have so thrill imagination the night before 
-PRON- pass slowly on -PRON- way with a mournful roll of wheel like the passing of a cortege like a file of artillerycaisson chariot dead body the engine smoke envelop -PRON- in a mournful veil leave a sense of melancholy in -PRON- wake move past there lugubrious lamentable infinitely sad under the grey sky and under the grey mist of rain which continue to fall with a subdued rustle sound steady persistent a vast monotonous murmur that seem to come from all quarter of the horizon at once 
when annixter arrive at the los muertos ranch house that same evening -PRON- find a little group already assemble in the diningroom 
magnus derrick wear the frock coat of broadcloth that -PRON- have put on for the occasion stand with -PRON- back to the fireplace 
harran sit close at hand one leg throw over the arm of -PRON- chair 
presley lounge on the sofa in corduroy and high laced boot smoke cigarette 
broderson lean on -PRON- fold arm at one corner of the dining table and genslinger editor and proprietor of the principal newspaper of the county the bonneville mercury stand with -PRON- hat and drive glove under -PRON- arm opposite derrick a halfemptied glass of whiskey and water in -PRON- hand 
as annixter enter -PRON- hear genslinger observe have a leader in the mercury tomorrow that will interest -PRON- people some talk of -PRON- ranch land be grade in value this winter 
i suppose -PRON- will all buy 
in an instant the editor word have rivet upon -PRON- the attention of every man in the room 
annixter break the moment silence that follow with the remark well -PRON- about time -PRON- grade these land of theirs 
the question in issue in remark be of the most vital interest to the rancher around bonneville and guadalajara 
neither magnus derrick broderson annixter nor osterman actually own all the ranch which -PRON- work 
as yet the vast majority of these wheat land be the property of the and the explanation of this condition of affair go back to the early history of the pacific and southwestern when as a bonus for the construction of the road the national government have grant to the company the odd numbered section of land on either side of the propose line of route for a distance of twenty mile 
indisputably these section belong to the and the evennumbered section be government property could be and have be take up by the rancher but the railroad section or as -PRON- be call the alternate section would have to be purchase direct from the railroad -PRON- 
but this have not prevent the farmer from come in upon that part of the san joaquin 
long before this the railroad have throw open these land and by mean of circular distribute broadcast throughout the state have expressly invite settlement thereon 
at that time patent have not be issue to the railroad for -PRON- oddnumbere section but as soon as the land be patent the railroad would grade -PRON- in value and offer -PRON- for sale the first occupant have the first chance of purchase 
the price of these land be to be fix by the price the government put upon -PRON- own adjoin two dollar and a half per acre 
with cultivation and improvement the ranch must inevitably appreciate in value 
there be every chance to make fortune 
when the railroad land about bonneville have be throw open there have be almost a rush in the matter of settlement and broderson annixter derrick and osterman be foremost with -PRON- claim have secure the pick of the country 
but the land once settle upon the and seem to be in no hurry as to fix exactly the value of -PRON- section include in the various ranch and offer -PRON- for sale 
the matter drag along from year to year be forget for month together be only bring to mind on such occasion as this when the rumour spread that the general office be about to take definite action in the affair 
as soon as the railroad want to talk business with -PRON- observed annixter about sell -PRON- -PRON- interest in quien sabe ready 
the land have more than quadruple in value bet i could sell -PRON- tomorrow for fifteen dollar an acre and if i buy of the railroad for two and a half an acre there s boodle in the game 
for two and a half exclaim genslinger 
-PRON- donot suppose the railroad will let -PRON- land go for any such figure as that do -PRON- 
wherever do -PRON- get that idea 
from the circular and pamphlet answer harran that the railroad issue to -PRON- when -PRON- open these land 
-PRON- be pledge to that 
even the and couldnot break such a pledge as that 
-PRON- be new in the country mr genslinger 
-PRON- donot remember the condition upon which -PRON- take up this land 
and -PRON- improvement exclaim annixter 
why magnus and i have put about five thousand dollar between -PRON- into that irrigating ditch already 
i guess -PRON- be not improve the land just to make -PRON- valuable for the railroad people 
no matter how much -PRON- improve the land or how much -PRON- increase in value -PRON- have get to stick by -PRON- agreement on the basis of twofifty per acre one case where the and get everything in sight 
genslinger frown perplex new in the country as harran say -PRON- answer but -PRON- seem to -PRON- that there s no fairness in that proposition 
the presence of the railroad have help increase the value of -PRON- ranch quite as much as -PRON- improvement 
why should -PRON- get all the benefit of the rise in value and the railroad nothing 
the fair way would be to share -PRON- between -PRON- donot care anything about that declare annixter 
-PRON- agree to charge but twofifty and -PRON- have get to stick to -PRON- 
well murmured genslinger from what i know of the affair i donot believe the and intend to sell for twofifty an acre at all 
the manager of the road want the good price -PRON- can get for everything in these hard time 
time arenot ever very hard for the railroad hazard old broderson 
broderson be the old man in the room 
-PRON- be about sixtyfive year of age venerable with a white beard -PRON- figure bent earthward with hard work 
-PRON- be a narrowminded man painfully conscientious in -PRON- statement lest -PRON- should be unjust to somebody a slow thinker unable to let a subject drop when once -PRON- have start upon -PRON- 
-PRON- have no sooner uttered -PRON- remark about hard time than -PRON- be move to qualify -PRON- 
hard time -PRON- repeat a troubled perplexed note in -PRON- voice well yesyes 
i suppose the road have hard time maybe 
everybody course 
i didnot mean that exactly 
i believe in be just and fair to everybody 
i mean that -PRON- have get to use -PRON- line and pay -PRON- charge good year bad year the and be the only road in the state 
that iswell when i say the only roadno i wonot say the road 
of course there be other road the and and the san francisco and north pacific that run up to ukiah 
i get a in ukiah not much of a wheat country round ukiah though -PRON- grow wheat there come to think 
but i guess -PRON- too far north 
well of course there isnot perhaps sixty thousand acre in the whole -PRON- include barley and oats 
i donot know maybe -PRON- nearer forty thousand 
i donot remember very well a good many year ago but annixter at the end of all patience turn to genslinger cut short the old man oh rot 
of course the railroad will sell at twofifty -PRON- cry get the contract 
look to -PRON- then mr annixter retort genslinger significantly look to -PRON- 
be sure that -PRON- be protect 
soon after this genslinger take -PRON- away and chinaman come in to set the table 
what do -PRON- suppose -PRON- mean ask broderson when genslinger be go 
about this land business say annixter 
oh i donot know 
some tom fool idea -PRON- get -PRON- term print in black and white in -PRON- circular -PRON- pledge 
oh as to pledge murmur broderson the railroad be not always much hinder by those 
osterman demand annixter abruptly change the subject as if -PRON- be not worth discussion that goat osterman come down here tonight 
-PRON- telephone -PRON- didnot -PRON- presley inquire magnus 
presley have take princess nathalie upon -PRON- knee stroke -PRON- long sleek hair and the cat stupefy with beatitude have close -PRON- eye to two fine line claw softly at the corduroy of trouser with alternate paw 
yes sir return presley 
-PRON- say -PRON- would be here 
and as -PRON- speak young osterman arrive 
-PRON- be a young fellow but singularly incline to baldness 
-PRON- ear very red and large stick out at right angle from either side of -PRON- head and -PRON- mouth too be great horizontal slit beneath -PRON- nose 
-PRON- cheek be of a brownish red the cheek bone a little salient 
-PRON- face be that of a comic actor a singer of song a man never at a loss for an answer continually strive to make a laugh 
but -PRON- take no great interest in ranching and leave the management of -PRON- land to -PRON- superintendent and foreman -PRON- -PRON- live in bonneville 
-PRON- be a poser a wearer of clothe forever act a part strive to create an impression to draw attention to -PRON- 
-PRON- be not without a certain energy but -PRON- devote -PRON- to small end to perfect -PRON- in little accomplishment continually run after some new thing incapable of persist long in any one course 
at one moment -PRON- mania would be fence the next trick the next archery 
for upward of one month -PRON- have devote -PRON- to learn how to play two banjo simultaneously then abandon this have develop a sudden passion for stamped leather work and have make a quantity of purse tennis belt and hat band which -PRON- present to young lady of -PRON- acquaintance 
-PRON- be -PRON- policy never to make an enemy 
-PRON- be like far better than -PRON- be respect 
people speak of -PRON- as that goat osterman or that fool osterman kid and invite -PRON- to dinner 
-PRON- be of the sort who somehow can not be ignore 
if only because of -PRON- clamour -PRON- make -PRON- important 
if -PRON- have one abide trait -PRON- be -PRON- desire of astonishing people and in some way best know to -PRON- manage to cause the circulation of the most extraordinary story wherein -PRON- -PRON- be the chief actor 
-PRON- be glib voluble dexterous ubiquitous a teller of funny story a cracker of joke 
naturally enough -PRON- be heavily in debt but carry the burden of -PRON- with perfect nonchalance

but -PRON- be angry with osterman muttering imprecation to -PRON- horribly vex that the young fellow should call -PRON- buck before wife 
this goat osterman -PRON- any sense that fool -PRON- ever learn how to behave before a feemale 
call -PRON- buck like that while mrs derrick be there 
why a stableboy would know better a hire man would have well manner 
all through the dinner that follow annixter be out of sort sulk in -PRON- place refuse to eat by way of vindicate -PRON- selfrespect resolving to bring osterman up with a sharp turn if -PRON- call -PRON- buck again 
the chinaman have make a certain kind of plum pudde for dessert and annixter who remember other dinner at the have be save -PRON- for this and have meditate upon -PRON- all through the meal 
no doubt -PRON- would restore all -PRON- good humour and -PRON- believe -PRON- stomach be so far recover as to be able to stand -PRON- 
but unfortunately the pudding be serve with a sauce that -PRON- thick gruellike colourless mixture make from plain water and sugar 
before -PRON- could interfere the chinaman have pour a quantity of -PRON- upon -PRON- plate 
faugh exclaim annixter

a little while after this the chinaman clear away the dessert and bring in coffee and cigar 
the whiskey bottle and the syphon of sodawat reappear 
the man ease -PRON- in -PRON- place push back from the table light -PRON- cigar talk of the beginning of the rain and the prospect of a rise in wheat

but princess nathalie the cat be uneasy 
annixter be occupy -PRON- own particular chair in which -PRON- sleep every night 
-PRON- could not go to sleep but spy upon -PRON- continually watch -PRON- every movement with -PRON- lambent yellow eye clear as amber 
then at length magnus who be at the head of the table move in -PRON- place assume a certain magisterial attitude 
well gentleman -PRON- observe have lose -PRON- case against the railroad the grainrate case 
ulsteen decide against -PRON- and now i hear rumour to the effect that rate for the hauling of grain be to be advanced 
when magnus have finish there be a moment silence each member of the group maintain -PRON- attitude of attention and interest 
-PRON- be harran who first speak 
behrman manipulate the whole affair a big deal of some kind in the air and if there be -PRON- all know who be back of -PRON- behrman of course but who s back of -PRON- 
shelgrim 
shelgrim 
the name fall squarely in the midst of the conversation abrupt grave sombre big with suggestion pregnant with huge association 
no one in the group who be not familiar with -PRON- no one for that matter in the county the state the whole reach of the west the entire union that do not entertain conviction as to the man who carry -PRON- a giant figure in the finance a product of circumstance an inevitable result of condition characteristic typical symbolic of ungovernable force 
in the new movement the new finance the reorganisation of capital the amalgamation of power the consolidation of enormous one individual be more constantly in the eye of the world no one be more hate more dreaded no one more compelling of unwilling tribute to -PRON- command genius to the colossal intellect operate the width of an entire continent than the president and owner of the pacific and southwestern donot think however -PRON- have move yet say magnus 
the thing for -PRON- then exclaim osterman be to stand from under before -PRON- do 
move yet snorted annixter probably move so long ago that -PRON- have never notice -PRON- 
in any case hazard magnus -PRON- be scarcely probable that the -PRON- be to be consummate 
if -PRON- act quickly there may be a chance 
act quickly 
how demand annixter 
good lord what can -PRON- do cinch already 
-PRON- all amount to just this try -PRON- and try -PRON- and -PRON- be stick every time 
-PRON- -PRON- derrick have just lose -PRON- grainrate case 
behrman do -PRON- up 
shelgrim own the court get man like ulsteen in -PRON- pocket get the railroad commission in -PRON- pocket get the governor of the state in -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- keep a milliondollar lobby at sacramento every minute of the time the legislature be in session -PRON- s get -PRON- own man on the floor of the united state senate 
-PRON- have the whole thing organise like an army corps 
what -PRON- go to do 
-PRON- sit in -PRON- office in san francisco and pull the string and -PRON- have get to dance hazarded broderson but there s the interstate commerce commission 
at least on longhaul rate -PRON- hoh yes the interstate commerce commission shout annixter scornfully great ainot -PRON- 
the great punch and judy show on earth almost as good as the railroad commission 
there never be and there never will be a california railroad commission not in the pay of the and -PRON- be to the railroad commission nevertheless remark magnus that the people of the state must look for relief 
that be -PRON- only hope 
once elect commissioner who would be loyal to the people and the whole system of excessive rate fall to the ground 
well why not a railroad commission of -PRON- own then suddenly declare young osterman 
because -PRON- canot be do retort annixter and if -PRON- could -PRON- canot organise the farmer in the san joaquin 
-PRON- try -PRON- once and -PRON- be enough to turn -PRON- stomach 
the railroad quietly buy delegate through behrman and do -PRON- up 
well that s the game to play say osterman decisively buy delegate the only game that seem to win admit harran gloomily 
or ever will win exclaim osterman a sudden excitement seem to take possession of -PRON- 
-PRON- face of a comic actor with -PRON- great slit of mouth and stiff red abruptly pink 
look here -PRON- cry this thing be get desperate fought and fight in the court and out and -PRON- have try agitation all the rest of -PRON- and behrman sack -PRON- every time 
now come the time when there s a prospect of a big crop -PRON- have have no rain for two year and the land have have a long rest 
if there be any rain at all this winter well have a bonanza year and just at this very moment when -PRON- have get -PRON- chance to pay off -PRON- mortgage and get clear of debt and make a be shelgrim make a deal to cinch -PRON- and put up rate 
and now here the primary come off and a new railroad commission go in why shelgrim choose this time to make -PRON- deal 
if -PRON- wait till shelgrim pull -PRON- off be do for that s flat 
i tell -PRON- be in a fix if -PRON- donot keep an eye open 
thing be get desperate 
magnus have just say that the key to the whole thing be the railroad commission 
well why not have a commission of -PRON- own 
never mind how -PRON- get -PRON- let get -PRON- 
if -PRON- got to be buy let buy -PRON- and put -PRON- own man on -PRON- and dictate what the rate will be 
suppose -PRON- cost a hundred thousand dollar 
well well get back more than that in cheap rate 
mr osterman say magnu fix the young man with a swift glance mr osterman -PRON- be propose a scheme of bribery sir be propose repeat osterman a scheme of bribery 
exactly so 
and a crazy wildeye scheme at that say annixter gruffly 
even suppose -PRON- buy a railroad commission and get -PRON- schedule of low rate what happen 
the and crowd get out an injunction and tie -PRON- up 
-PRON- would tie -PRON- up too 
haul at low rate be well than no hauling at all 
the wheat have get to be move 
oh rot cry annixter -PRON- ever go to learn any sense -PRON- know that cheap transportation would benefit the liverpool buyer and not -PRON- -PRON- be into -PRON- that -PRON- canot buck against the railroad 
when -PRON- try to buy a board of commissioner donot -PRON- see that -PRON- will have to bid against the railroad bid against a corporation that can chuck out million to -PRON- thousand 
do -PRON- think -PRON- can bid against the and the railroad donot need to know -PRON- be in the game against -PRON- till -PRON- have get -PRON- man seat 
and when -PRON- have get -PRON- seat what s to prevent the corporation buy -PRON- right over -PRON- head 
if -PRON- have get the right kind of man in -PRON- could not be buy that way interpose harran donot know but what there s something in what osterman say have the naming of the commission and -PRON- would name honest man 
annixter strike the table with -PRON- fist in exasperation 
honest man -PRON- shout the kind of man -PRON- could get to go into such a scheme would have to be to begin with 
broderson shift uneasily in -PRON- place finger -PRON- beard with a vague uncertain gesture speak again -PRON- would be the of out against the certainty of shelgrim do -PRON- up 
that be -PRON- hasten to add a certainty pretty near a certainty 
of course -PRON- would be a chance exclaim osterman 
but -PRON- come to the point where -PRON- have get to take chance risk a big stake to make a big strike and risk be well than sure failure can be no party to a scheme of avow bribery and corruption mr osterman declare magnus a ring of severity in -PRON- voice be surprised sir that -PRON- should even broach the subject in -PRON- hearing 
and cry annixter -PRON- canot be do donot know mutter harran maybe -PRON- just want a little spark like this to fire the whole train 
magnus glance at -PRON- son in considerable surprise 
-PRON- have not expect this of harran 
but so great be -PRON- affection for -PRON- son so accustomed have -PRON- become to listen to -PRON- advice to respect -PRON- opinion that for the moment after the first shock of surprise and disappointment -PRON- be influence to give a certain degree of attention to this new proposition 
-PRON- in no way countenance -PRON- 
at any moment -PRON- be prepared to rise in -PRON- place and denounce -PRON- and osterman both 
-PRON- be trickery of the most contemptible order a thing -PRON- believe to be unknown to the old school of politic and statesmanship to which -PRON- be proud to belong but since harran even for one moment consider -PRON- -PRON- magnu who trust harran implicitly would do -PRON- be only to oppose and defeat -PRON- in -PRON- very beginning 
and abruptly the discussion begin 
gradually osterman by dint of -PRON- clamour -PRON- strident reiteration the plausibility of -PRON- glib ready assertion the ease with which -PRON- extricate -PRON- when apparently drive to a corner completely win over old broderson to -PRON- way of thinking 
osterman bewilder -PRON- with -PRON- volubility the lightning rapidity with which -PRON- leap from one subject to another garrulous witty flamboyant terrify the old man with picture of the swift approach of ruin the imminence of danger 
annixter who lead the argument against argument though -PRON- to poor advantage unable to present -PRON- side effectively 
-PRON- call osterman a fool a goat a senseless crazyheade jackass but be unable to refute -PRON- assertion 
-PRON- debate be the clumsy heaving of brickbat brutal direct 
-PRON- contradict everything osterman say as a matter of principle make conflicting assertion declaration that be absolutely inconsistent and when osterman or harran use these against -PRON- could only exclaim well in a way -PRON- so and then again in a way -PRON- isnot 
but suddenly osterman discover a new argument 
if -PRON- swing this deal -PRON- cry get old jellybelly behrman right where -PRON- want -PRON- the man that do -PRON- every time cry harran 
if there be dirty work to be do in which the railroad doesnot wish to appear -PRON- be behrman who do -PRON- 
if the freight rate be to be adjust to squeeze -PRON- a little hard -PRON- be behrman who regulate what -PRON- can stand 
if there s a judge to be buy -PRON- be behrman who do the bargaining 
if there be a jury to be bribe -PRON- be behrman who handle the money 
if there be an election to be job -PRON- be behrman who manipulate -PRON- 
behrman here and behrman there 
-PRON- be behrman -PRON- come against every time -PRON- make a move 
-PRON- be behrman who have the grip of -PRON- and will never let go till -PRON- have squeeze -PRON- bone dry 
why when i think of -PRON- all sometimes i wonder i keep -PRON- hand off the man 
osterman get on -PRON- foot lean across the table gesture wildly with -PRON- right hand -PRON- seriocomic face with -PRON- bald forehead and stiff red ear be inflame with excitement 
-PRON- take the floor create an impression attract all attention to -PRON- play to the gallery gesticulate clamourous full of noise 
well now be -PRON- chance to get even -PRON- vociferate 
-PRON- be now or never 
-PRON- can take -PRON- and save the situation for yourself and all california or -PRON- can leave -PRON- and rot on -PRON- own ranch 
buck i know -PRON- 
i know -PRON- be not afraid of anything that wear skin 
i know -PRON- have get sand all through -PRON- and i know if i show -PRON- how -PRON- could put -PRON- deal through and seat a commission of -PRON- own -PRON- wouldnot hang back 
governor -PRON- be a brave man 
-PRON- know the advantage of prompt and fearless action 
-PRON- be not the sort to shrink from take chance 
to play for big stake be just -PRON- stake a fortune on the turn of a card 
-PRON- didnot get the reputation of be the strong poker player in el dorado county for nothing 
now here the big gamble that ever come -PRON- way 
if -PRON- stand up to -PRON- like man with gut in -PRON- well win out 
if -PRON- hesitate be lose donot suppose -PRON- can help play the goat osterman remark annixter but what s -PRON- idea 
what do -PRON- think -PRON- can do not say -PRON- hasten to interpose that -PRON- have anyways convince -PRON- by all this cackling 
i know as well as -PRON- that -PRON- be in a hole 
but i know that before i come here tonight not do anything to make -PRON- change -PRON- mind 
but just what do -PRON- propose hear -PRON- 
well i say the first thing to do be to see disbrow the political boss of the denver pueblo and mojave road 
-PRON- will have to get in with the machine some way and that s particularly why i want magnus with -PRON- 
-PRON- know politic better than any of -PRON- and if -PRON- donot want to get sell again -PRON- will have to have some one that s in the know to steer -PRON- 
the only politic i understand mr osterman answer magnus sternly be honest politic 
-PRON- must look elsewhere for -PRON- political manager 
i refuse to have any part in this matter 
if the railroad commission can be nominate legitimately if -PRON- arrangement can be make without bribery i be with -PRON- to the last iota of -PRON- ability 
well -PRON- canot get what -PRON- want without pay for -PRON- contradict annixter 
broderson be about to speak when osterman kick -PRON- foot under the table 
-PRON- -PRON- hold -PRON- peace 
-PRON- be quick to see that if -PRON- could involve magnus and annixter in an argument annixter for the mere love of contention would oppose the governor and without know -PRON- would commit -PRON- to this be precisely what happen 
in a few moment annixter be declare at top voice -PRON- readiness to mortgage the crop of quien sabe if necessary for the sake of bust behrman 
-PRON- could see no great obstacle in the way of control the nominate convention so far as secure the naming of two railroad commissioner be concern 
two be all -PRON- need 
probably -PRON- cost money 
-PRON- didnot get something for nothing 
-PRON- would cost -PRON- all a good deal more if -PRON- sit like lump on a log and play tiddledywink while shelgrim sell out from under -PRON- 
then there be this too the and be hard up just then 
the shortage on the wheat crop for the last two year have affect -PRON- too 
-PRON- be retrench in expenditure all along the line -PRON- just cut wage in all department 
there be this affair of to prove -PRON- 
the railroad didnot always act as a unit either 
there be always a party in -PRON- that oppose spending too much money 
-PRON- would bet that party be strong just now 
-PRON- be kind of sick -PRON- of be kick by behrman that pip turn up on -PRON- ranch that very day to bully -PRON- about -PRON- own line fence 
next -PRON- would be tell -PRON- what kind of clothe -PRON- ought to wear 
harran have the right idea 
somebody have get to be bust mighty soon now and -PRON- didnot propose that -PRON- should be -PRON- 
now -PRON- be talk something like sense observe osterman think -PRON- would see -PRON- like that when -PRON- get -PRON- idea 
-PRON- idea idea cry annixter 
why have this idea -PRON- for over three year 
what about disbrow ask harran hasten to interrupt 
why do -PRON- want to see disbrow 
disbrow be the political man for the denver pueblo and mojave answer osterman and -PRON- see -PRON- like this the mojave road donot run up into the valley at all 
-PRON- terminus be way to the south of -PRON- and -PRON- donot care anything about grain rate through the san joaquin 
-PRON- donot care how antirailroad the commission be because the ruling canot affect -PRON- 
but -PRON- divide traffic with the and in the southern part of the state and -PRON- have a good deal of influence with that road 
i want to get the mojave road through disbrow to recommend a commissioner of -PRON- choosing to the and and have the and adopt -PRON- as -PRON- own 
who for instance 
darrell that los angele manremember 
well darrell be no particular friend of disbrow say annixter 
why should disbrow take -PRON- up cry osterman 
-PRON- make -PRON- worth while to do -PRON- 
-PRON- go to -PRON- and say mr disbrow -PRON- manage the politic for the mojave railroad and what -PRON- say go with -PRON- board of director 
-PRON- want -PRON- to adopt -PRON- candidate for railroad commissioner for the third district 
how much do -PRON- want for do -PRON- 
i -PRON- can buy disbrow 
that give -PRON- one commissioner 
-PRON- need not bother about that any more 
in the first district -PRON- donot make any move at all 
-PRON- let the political manager of the and nominate whoever -PRON- like 
then -PRON- concentrate all -PRON- effort to put in -PRON- man in the second district 
there be where the big fight will come see perfectly well what -PRON- mean mr osterman observe magnu but make no mistake sir as to -PRON- attitude in this business 
-PRON- may count -PRON- as out of -PRON- entirely 
well suppose -PRON- win put in annixter truculently already acknowledge -PRON- as involve in the propose undertaking suppose -PRON- win and get low rate for haul grain 
how about -PRON- then 
-PRON- count -PRON- then donot -PRON- 
-PRON- get all the benefit of low rate without share any of the risk -PRON- take to secure -PRON- 
no nor any of the expense either 
no -PRON- wonot dirty -PRON- finger with help -PRON- put this deal through but -PRON- wonot be so curse particular when -PRON- come to share the profit will -PRON- 
magnus rise abruptly to -PRON- full height the nostril of -PRON- thin hawklike nose vibrate -PRON- smoothshaven face paler than ever 
stop right where -PRON- be sir -PRON- exclaim 
-PRON- forget -PRON- mr annixter 
please understand that i tolerate such word as -PRON- have permit -PRON- to make use of from no man not even from -PRON- guest 
i shall ask -PRON- to apologise 
in an instant -PRON- dominate the entire group impose a respect that be as much fear as admiration 
no one make response 
for the moment -PRON- be the master again the leader 
like so many delinquent schoolboy the other cower before -PRON- ashamed put to confusion unable to find -PRON- tongue 
in that brief instant of silence follow upon outburst and while -PRON- hold -PRON- subdue and overmaster the fabric of -PRON- scheme of corruption and dishonesty tremble to -PRON- base 
-PRON- be the last protest of the old school rise up there in denunciation of the new order of thing the statesman oppose to the politician honesty rectitude uncompromise integrity prevail for the last time against the devious manoeuvre the evil communication the rotten expediency of a corrupted institution 
for a few second no one answer 
then annixter move abruptly and uneasily in -PRON- place mutter speak upon provocation 
if -PRON- like well consider -PRON- unsay 
i donot know what s go to become of out of business i presume understand magnus all right put in osterman 
-PRON- donot have to go into this thing if -PRON- against -PRON- conscience all right 
magnus can stay out if -PRON- want to but that wonot prevent -PRON- go ahead and see what -PRON- can do 
only there s this about -PRON- 
-PRON- turn again to magnus speak with every degree of earnestness every appearance of conviction do not deny governor from the very start that this would mean bribery 
but -PRON- donot suppose that i like the idea either 
if there be one legitimate hope that be yet leave untried no matter how forlorn -PRON- be i would try -PRON- 
but there s not 
-PRON- be literally and soberly true that every mean of honest be attempt 
shelgrim be go to cinch -PRON- 
grain rate be increase while on the other hand the price of wheat be sag low and lower all the time 
if -PRON- donot do something -PRON- be ruin 
osterman pause for a moment allow precisely the right number of second to elapse then alter and lower -PRON- voice add respect the principle 
i admire -PRON- 
-PRON- do -PRON- every degree of credit 
then turn directly to magnus -PRON- conclude with but i only want -PRON- to ask -PRON- sir if at such a crisis one ought to think of oneself to consider purely personal motive in such a desperate situation as this 
now -PRON- want -PRON- with -PRON- governor perhaps not openly if -PRON- donot wish -PRON- but tacitly at least 
i wonot ask -PRON- for an answer tonight but what i do ask of -PRON- be to consider this matter seriously and think over the whole business 
will -PRON- do -PRON- 
osterman cease definitely to speak lean forward across the table -PRON- eye fix on face 
there be a silence 
outside the rain fall continually with an even monotonous murmur 
in the group of man around the table no one stir nor speak 
-PRON- look steadily at magnus who for the moment keep -PRON- glance fix thoughtfully upon the table before -PRON- 
in another moment -PRON- raise -PRON- head and look from face to face around the group 
after all these be -PRON- neighbour -PRON- friend man with whom -PRON- have be upon the close term of association 
in a way -PRON- represent what now have come to be -PRON- world 
-PRON- single swift glance take in the man one after another 
annixter rugge crude sit awkwardly and uncomfortably in -PRON- chair -PRON- unhandsome face with -PRON- outthrust low lip and deeply cleft masculine chin flush and eager -PRON- yellow hair disorder the one tuft on the crown stand stiffly forth like the feather in an scalp lock broderson vaguely comb at -PRON- long beard with a persistent maniacal gesture distress troubled and uneasy osterman with -PRON- comedy face the face of a musichall singer -PRON- head bald and set off by -PRON- great red ear lean back in -PRON- place softly crack the knuckle of a forefinger and last of all and close to -PRON- elbow -PRON- son -PRON- support -PRON- confidant and companion harran so like -PRON- with -PRON- own erect fine carriage -PRON- thin beaklike nose and -PRON- blond hair with -PRON- tendency to curl in a forward direction in front of the ear young strong courageous full of the promise of the future year 
-PRON- blue eye look straight into -PRON- father with what magnus could fancy a glance of appeal 
magnus could see that expression in the face of the other very plainly 
-PRON- look to -PRON- as -PRON- natural leader -PRON- chief who be to bring -PRON- out from this abominable trouble which be close in upon -PRON- and in -PRON- all -PRON- see many type man around -PRON- table on that night of the first rain of a come to stand in -PRON- imagination for many the farmer rancher and wheat grower of the great san joaquin 
-PRON- word be the word of a whole community -PRON- distress the distress of an entire state harry beyond the bound of endurance drive to the wall coerce exploit harassed to the limit of exasperation will think of -PRON- -PRON- say then hasten to add but i can tell -PRON- beforehand that -PRON- may expect only a refusal 
after magnus have speak there be a prolong silence 
the conference seem of -PRON- to have come to an end for that evening 
presley light another cigarette from the butt of the one -PRON- have be smoke and the cat princess nathalie disturb by -PRON- movement and by a whiff of drift smoke jump from -PRON- knee to the floor and pick -PRON- way across the room to annixter rub gently against -PRON- leg -PRON- tail in the air -PRON- back delicately arched 
no doubt -PRON- think -PRON- time to settle -PRON- for the night and as annixter give no indication of vacate -PRON- chair -PRON- choose this way of cajole -PRON- into cede -PRON- place to -PRON- 
but annixter be irritate at the attention misunderstand -PRON- motive 
get out -PRON- exclaim lift -PRON- foot to the rung of the chair 
lord love -PRON- but i sure do hate a cat 
by the way observe osterman pass genslinger by the gate as i come in tonight 
have -PRON- be here 
yes -PRON- be here say harran and but annixter take the word out of -PRON- mouth 
-PRON- say there s some talk of the railroad sell -PRON- -PRON- section this winter 
oh -PRON- do do -PRON- exclaim osterman interested at once 
where do -PRON- hear that 
where do a railroad paper get -PRON- news 
from the general office i suppose hope -PRON- didnot get -PRON- straight from headquarter that the land be to be grade at twenty dollar an acre murmur broderson that demand osterman 
twenty dollar 
here put -PRON- on somebody all up 
what do genslinger say 
oh -PRON- neednot get scared say annixter 
genslinger donot know that s all 
-PRON- think there be no understanding that the price of the land should not be advance when the and come to sell to -PRON- 
oh muttered osterman relieve 
magnus who have go out into the office on the other side of the glassroofed hallway return with a long yellow envelope in -PRON- hand stuff with newspaper clipping and thin closely print pamphlet 
here be the circular -PRON- remark draw out one of the pamphlet 
the condition of settlement to which the railroad obligate -PRON- be very explicit 
-PRON- run over the page of the circular then read aloud company invite settler to go upon -PRON- land before patent be issue or the road be complete and intend in such case to sell to -PRON- in preference to any other applicant and at a price base upon the value of the land without improvement and on the other page here -PRON- remark -PRON- refer to this again 
in ascertain the value of the land any improvement that a settler or any other person may have on the land will not be take into consideration neither will the price be increase in consequence thereof 
settler be thus insure that in addition to be accord the first privilege of purchase at the grade price -PRON- will also be protect in -PRON- improvement 
and here -PRON- comment in section -PRON- read the land be not uniform in price but be offer at various figure from upward per acre 
usually land cover with tall timber be hold at per acre and that with pine at most be for sale at and when -PRON- come to read that carefully hazarded old broderson not so be for sale at twofifty an acre -PRON- say 
that donot mean that only mean i wish now that i have secure a more ironclad agreement from the and when i take up -PRON- section on -PRON- ranch genslinger be in a position to know the intention of the railroad 
at least be in with -PRON- 
all newspaper man be 
those i mean who be subsidise by the general office 
but perhaps genslinger isnot subsidise i donot know be not sure 
oh -PRON- donot know and -PRON- do know and maybe and perhaps and -PRON- be not so sure vociferate annixter 
how about ignore the value of -PRON- improvement 
nothing hazy about statement i guess 
-PRON- say in so many word that any improvement -PRON- make will not be consider when the land be appraise and that s the same thing isnot -PRON- 
the unimproved land be worth twofifty an acre only timber land be worth more and there s none too much timber about here 
well one thing at a time say harran 
the thing for -PRON- now be to get into this primary election and the convention and see if -PRON- can push -PRON- man for railroad commissioner 
right declare annixter 
-PRON- rise stretch -PRON- arm above -PRON- head about talk all the wind out of -PRON- -PRON- say 
think be move along pretty near midnight 
but when guest turn -PRON- attention to the matter of return to -PRON- different ranch -PRON- abruptly realise that the downpour have double and treble in -PRON- volume since earlier in the evening 
the field and road be veritable sea of viscid mud the night absolutely blackdark assuredly not a night in which to venture out 
magnus insist that the three rancher should put up at los muertos 
osterman accept at once annixter after an interminable discussion allow -PRON- to be persuade in the end accept as though grant a favour 
broderson protest that -PRON- wife who be not well would expect -PRON- to return that night and would no doubt fret if -PRON- do not appear 
furthermore -PRON- live close by at the junction of the county and low road 
-PRON- put a sack over -PRON- head and shoulder persistently decline offer umbrella and rubber coat and hurry away remark that -PRON- have no foreman on -PRON- ranch and have to be up and about at five the next morning to put -PRON- man to work 
fool mutter annixter when the old man have go 
imagine farm a ranch the size of -PRON- without a foreman 
harran show osterman and annixter where -PRON- be to sleep in adjoin room 
magnus soon afterward retire 
osterman find an excuse for go to bed but annixter and harran remain in the latter room in a haze of blue tobacco smoke talk talk 
but at length at the end of all argument annixter get up remark well go to turn in nearly two oclock 
-PRON- go to -PRON- room close the door and harran open -PRON- window to clear out the tobacco smoke look out for a moment across the country toward the south 
the darkness be profound impenetrable the rain fall with an uninterrupted roar 
near at hand one could hear the sound of dripping eave and foliage and the eager sucking sound of the drink earth and abruptly while harran stand look out one hand upon the upraised sash a great puff of the outside air invade the room odourous with the reek of the soak earth redolent with fertility pungent heavy tepid 
-PRON- close the window again and sit for a few moment on the edge of the bed one shoe in -PRON- hand thoughtful and absorb wonder if -PRON- father would involve -PRON- in this new scheme wonder if after all -PRON- want -PRON- to 
but suddenly -PRON- be aware of a commotion issue from the direction of room and the voice of annixter -PRON- upraised in expostulation and exasperation 
the door of the room to which annixter have be assign open with a violent wrench and an angry voice exclaim to anybody who would listen oh yes funny isnot -PRON- 
in a way -PRON- funny and then again in a way -PRON- isnot 
the door bang to so that all the window of the house rattle in -PRON- frame 
harran hurry out into the diningroom and there meet presley and -PRON- father who have be arouse as well by clamour 
osterman be there too -PRON- bald head gleam like a bulb of ivory in the light of the lamp that magnu carry all up demand osterman 
whatever in the world be the matter with buck 
confused and terrible sound come from behind the door of room 
a prolonged monologue of grievance break by explosion of wrath and the vague noise of some one in a furious hurry 
all at once and before harran have a chance to knock on the door annixter fling -PRON- open 
-PRON- face be blaze with anger -PRON- outthrust lip more prominent than ever -PRON- wiry yellow hair in disarray the tuft on the crown sticking straight into the air like the upraised hackle of an angry hound 
evidently -PRON- have be dress -PRON- with the most headlong rapidity -PRON- have not yet put on -PRON- coat and vest but carry -PRON- over -PRON- arm while with -PRON- disengage hand -PRON- keep hitch -PRON- suspender over -PRON- shoulder with a persistent and hypnotic gesture 
without a moment pause -PRON- give vent to -PRON- indignation in a torrent of word

-PRON- storm to the door lead out upon the porch deaf to all reason 
harran and presley follow -PRON- try to dissuade -PRON- from go home at that time of night and in such a storm but annixter be not to be placate 
-PRON- stamp across to the barn where -PRON- horse and buggy have be stable splash through the puddle under foot go out of -PRON- way to drench -PRON- refuse even to allow presley and harran to help -PRON- harness the horse the use of make a fool of -PRON- annixter remonstrate presley as annixter back the horse from the stall 
-PRON- act just like a boy 
if osterman want to play the goat why should -PRON- help -PRON- out a vociferated annixter 
-PRON- donot understand presley 
-PRON- run in -PRON- family to hate anything sticky heredity 
how would -PRON- like to get into bed at two in the morning and jam -PRON- foot down into a slimy mess like that 
oh no not so funny then 
and -PRON- mark -PRON- word mr harran derrick -PRON- continue as -PRON- climb into the buggy shake the whip toward harran this business -PRON- talk over of -PRON- yellow too dishonest 
-PRON- cut the horse across the back with the whip and drive out into the pelting rain 
in a few second the sound of -PRON- buggy wheel be lose in the muffled roar of the downpour 
harran and presley close the barn and return to the house shelter -PRON- under a tarpaulin carriage cover 
once inside harran go to remonstrate with osterman who be still up 
magnus have again retire 
the house have fall quiet again 
as presley cross the diningroom on the way to -PRON- own apartment in the second story of the house -PRON- pause for a moment look about -PRON- 
in the dull light of the lower lamp the redwood panelling of the room show a dark crimson as though stain with blood 
on the massive slab of the dining table the halfemptied glass and bottle stand about in the confusion in which -PRON- have be leave reflect -PRON- deep into the polished wood the glass door of the case of stuff bird be a subdue shimmer the manycoloure navajo blanket over the couch seem a mere patch of brown 
around the table the chair in which the man have sit throughout the evening still range -PRON- in a semicircle vaguely suggestive of the conference of the past few hour with all -PRON- possibility of good and evil -PRON- significance of a future big with portent 
the room be still 
only on the cushion of the chair that annixter have occupy the cat princess nathalie at last comfortably settle in -PRON- accustomed place doze complacently -PRON- paw tuck under -PRON- breast fill the deserted room with the subdued murmur of -PRON- contented purr 
on the quien sabe ranch in one of -PRON- western division near the line fence that divide -PRON- from the osterman hold vanamee be harness the horse to the plough to which -PRON- have be assign two day before a stableboy from the division barn help -PRON- 
promptly discharge from the employ of the sheepraiser after the lamentable accident near the long trestle vanamee have present -PRON- to harran ask for employment 
the season be begin on all the ranch work be be resume 
the rain have put the ground into admirable condition for ploughing and annixter broderson and osterman all have -PRON- gang at work 
thus vanamee be vastly surprised to find los muerto idle the horse still in the barn the man gather in the shade of the bunkhouse and eatinghouse smoking dozing or go aimlessly about -PRON- arm dangle 
the plough for which magnus and harran be wait in a fury of impatience have not yet arrive and since the management of los muerto have count upon have these in hand long before this time no provision have be make for keep the old stock in repair many of these old plough be useless break and out of order some have be sell 
-PRON- could not be say definitely when the new plough would arrive 
harran have decide to wait one week longer and then in case of -PRON- nonappearance to buy a consignment of the old style of plough from the dealer in bonneville 
-PRON- could afford to lose the money well than -PRON- could afford to lose the season 
fail of work on los muertos vanamee have go to quien sabe 
annixter whom -PRON- have speak to first have send -PRON- across the ranch to one of -PRON- division superintendent and this latter after assure -PRON- of familiarity with horse and -PRON- previous though somewhat los muerto have take -PRON- on as a driver of one of the gang plough then at work on -PRON- division 
the evening before when the foreman have blow -PRON- whistle at six oclock the long line of plough have halt upon the instant and the driver unharness -PRON- team have take -PRON- back to the division the ploughs as -PRON- be in the furrow 
but an hour after daylight the next morning the work be resume 
after breakfast vanamee ride one horse and lead the other have return to the line of plough together with the other driver 
now -PRON- be busy harness the team 
at the division blacksmith put have be oblige to wait while one of -PRON- lead horse be shod and -PRON- have thus be delay quite five minute 
nearly all the other team be harness the driver on -PRON- seat wait for the foreman signal 
all ready here inquire the foreman drive up to team in -PRON- buggy 
all ready sir answer vanamee buckle the last strap 
-PRON- climb to -PRON- seat shake out the rein and turn about look back along the line then all around -PRON- at the landscape inundate with the brilliant glow of the early morning 
the day be fine 
since the first rain of the season there have be no other 
now the sky be without a cloud pale blue delicate luminous scintillate with morning 
the great brown earth turn a huge flank to -PRON- exhale the moisture of the early dew 
the atmosphere wash clean of dust and mist be translucent as crystal 
far off to the east the hill on the other side of broderson creek stand out against the pallid saffron of the horizon as flat and as sharply outline as if paste on the sky 
the campanile of the ancient mission of san juan seem as fine as frost work 
all about between the horizon the carpet of the land unroll -PRON- to infinity 
but now -PRON- be no longer parch with heat crack and warp by a merciless sun powder with dust 
the rain have do -PRON- work not a clod that be not swell with fertility not a fissure that do not exhale the sense of fecundity 
one could not take a dozen step upon the ranch without the brusque sensation that underfoot the land be alive rouse at last from -PRON- sleep palpitate with the desire of reproduction 
deep down there in the recess of the soil the great heart throb once more thrill with passion vibrate with desire offer -PRON- to the caress of the plough insistent eager imperious 
dimly one feel the deepseate trouble of the earth the uneasy agitation of -PRON- member the hidden tumult of -PRON- womb demand to be make fruitful to reproduce to disengage the eternal renascent germ of life that stir and struggle in -PRON- loin 
the ploughs thirtyfive in number each draw by -PRON- team of ten stretch in an interminable line nearly a quarter of a mile in length behind and ahead of vanamee 
-PRON- be arrange as -PRON- be en echelon not in one directly behind the other but each succeed plough -PRON- own width farther in the field than the one in front of -PRON- 
each of these plough hold five shear so that when the entire company be in motion one hundred and seventyfive furrow be make at the same instant 
at a distance the ploughs resemble a great column of field artillery 
each driver be in -PRON- place -PRON- glance alternate between -PRON- horse and the foreman near at hand 
other foreman in -PRON- buggy or buckboard be at interval along the line like battery lieutenant 
annixter -PRON- on horseback in boot and campaign hat a cigar in -PRON- tooth overlook the scene 
the division superintendent on the opposite side of the line gallop past to a position at the head 
for a long moment there be a silence 
a sense of preparedness run from end to end of the column 
all thing be ready each man in -PRON- place 
the day work be about to begin 
suddenly from a distance at the head of the line come the shrill trilling of a whistle 
at once the foreman near vanamee repeat -PRON- at the same time turn down the line and wave one arm 
the signal be repeat whistle answer whistle till the sound lose -PRON- in the distance 
at once the line of plough lose -PRON- immobility move forward get slowly under way the horse strain in the trace 
a prolonged movement ripple from team to team disengage in -PRON- passage a multitude of click of buckle the creak of strain leather the subdue clash of machinery the cracking of whip the deep breathing of nearly four hundred horse the abrupt command and cry of the driver and last of all the prolong soothing murmur of the thick brown earth turn steadily from the multitude of advance shear 
the plough thus commence continue 
the sun rise high 
steadily the hundred iron hand knead and furrow and stroke the brown humid earth the hundred iron tooth bit deep into the flesh 
perch on -PRON- seat the moist living rein slip and tugging in -PRON- hand vanamee in the midst of this steady confusion of constantly vary sensation sight interrupt by sound sound mingling with sight on this swaying vibrate seat quiver with the prolonged thrill of the earth lapse to a sort of pleasing numbness in a sense hypnotise by the weave maze of thing in which -PRON- find -PRON- involved 
to keep -PRON- team at an even regular gait maintain the precise interval to run -PRON- furrow as closely as possible to those already make by the plough in for the moment be the entire sum of -PRON- duty 
but while one part of -PRON- brain alert and watchful take cognisance of these matter all the great part be lull and stupefy with the long monotony of the affair 
the plough now in full swing envelop -PRON- in a vague slowmove whirl of thing 
underneath -PRON- be the jar jolt trembling machine not a clod be turn not an obstacle encounter that -PRON- do not receive the swift impression of -PRON- through all -PRON- body the very friction of the damp soil slide incessantly from the shiny surface of the shear seem to reproduce -PRON- in -PRON- fingertip and along the back of -PRON- head 
-PRON- hear the horsehoof by the myriad crush down easily deeply into the loam the prolong clinking of tracechain the working of the smooth brown flank in the harness the clatter of wooden hame the champing of bit the click of iron shoe against pebble the brittle stubble of the surface ground crackling and snap as the furrow turn the sonorous steady breath wrench from the deep labouring chest strapbound shine with sweat and all along the line the voice of the man talk to the horse 
everywhere there be vision of glossy brown back strain heaving swollen with muscle harness streak with speck of froth broad cupshape hoof heavy with brown loam men face red with tan blue overall spot with axlegrease muscle hand the knuckle whiten in -PRON- grip on the rein and through -PRON- all the ammoniacal smell of the horse the bitter reek of perspiration of beast and man the aroma of warm leather the scent of dead strong and more penetrate than everything else the heavy enervate odour of the upturned live earth 
at interval from the top of one of the rare low swell of the land vanamee overlook a wide horizon 
on the other division of quien sabe the same work be in progress 
occasionally -PRON- could see another column of plough in the adjoining so close at hand that the subdued murmur of -PRON- movement reach -PRON- ear sometimes so distant that -PRON- resolve -PRON- into a long brown streak upon the grey of the ground 
farther off to the west on the osterman ranch other column come and go and once from the crest of the high swell on -PRON- division vanamee catch a distant glimpse of the broderson ranch 
there too move speck indicate that the ploughing be under way 
and farther away still far off there beyond the fine line of the horizon over the curve of the globe the shoulder of the earth -PRON- know be other ranch and beyond these other and beyond these still other the immensity multiply to infinity 
everywhere throughout the great san joaquin unseen and unheard a thousand plough upstirre the land ten of thousand of shear clutch deep into the warm moist soil 
-PRON- be the long stroke caress vigorous male powerful for which the earth seem pant 
the heroic embrace of a multitude of iron hand grip deep into the brown warm flesh of the land that quiver responsive and passionate under this rude advance so robust as to be almost an assault so violent as to be veritably brutal 
there under the sun and under the speckless sheen of the sky the wooing of the titan begin the vast primal passion the two worldforce the elemental male and female lock in a colossal embrace at grapple in the throe of an infinite desire at once terrible and divine know no law untamed savage natural sublime 
from time to time the gang in which vanamee work halt on the signal from foreman or overseer 
the horse come to a standstill the vague clamour of the work lapse away 
then the minute pass 
the whole work hang suspend 
all up and down the line one demand what have happen 
the division superintendent gallop past perplexed and anxious 
for the moment one of the ploughs be out of order a bolt have slip a lever refuse to work or a machine have become immobilised in heavy ground or a horse have lame -PRON- 
once even toward noon an entire plough be take out of the line so out of gear that a messenger have to be send to the division forge to summon the machinist 
annixter have disappear 
-PRON- have ride farther on to the other division of -PRON- ranch to watch the work in progress there 
at twelve oclock accord to -PRON- order all the division superintendent put -PRON- in communication with -PRON- by mean of the telephone wire that connect each of the division house report the condition of the work the number of acre cover the prospect of each plough traverse -PRON- daily average of twenty mile 
at halfpast twelve vanamee and the rest of the driver eat -PRON- lunch in the field the tin bucket have be distribute to -PRON- that morning after breakfast 
but in the evening the routine of the previous day be repeat and vanamee unharness -PRON- team ride one horse and lead the other return to the division barn and bunkhouse 
-PRON- be between six and seven oclock 
the half hundred man of the gang throw -PRON- upon the supper the chinese cook have set out in the shed of the eatinghouse long as a bowling alley unpainte crude the seat bench the table cover with oil cloth 
overhead a halfdozen kerosene lamp flare and smoke 
the table be take as if by assault the clatter of iron knife upon the tin plate be as the reverberation of hail upon a metal roof 
the plowman rinse -PRON- throat with great draught of wine and -PRON- elbow wide -PRON- forehead flush resume the attack upon the beef and bread eat as though -PRON- would never have enough 
all up and down the long table where the kerosene lamp reflect -PRON- deep in the oilcloth cover one hear the incessant sound of mastication and see the uninterrupted movement of great jaw 
at every moment one or another of the man demand a fresh portion of beef another pint of wine another halfloaf of bread 
for upward of an hour the gang eat 
-PRON- be no longer a supper 
-PRON- be a veritable barbecue a crude and primitive feasting barbaric homeric 
but in all this scene vanamee see nothing repulsive 
presley would have abhor feed of the people this gorging of the human animal eager for -PRON- meat 
vanamee simple uncomplicated live so close to nature and the rudimentary life understand -PRON- significance 
-PRON- know very well that within a short halfhour after this meal the man would throw -PRON- down in -PRON- bunk to sleep without move inert and stupefy with fatigue till the morning 
work food and sleep all life reduce to -PRON- bare essential uncomplex honest healthy 
-PRON- be strong these man with the strength of the soil -PRON- work in touch with the essential thing back again to the starting point of civilisation coarse vital real and sane 
for a brief moment immediately after the meal pipe be light and the air grow thick with fragrant tobacco smoke 
on a corner of the diningroom table a game of poker be begin 
one of the driver a swede produce an accordion a group on the step of the bunkhouse listen with alternate gravity and shout of laughter to the acknowledge storyteller of the gang 
but soon the man begin to turn in stretch -PRON- at full length on the horse blanket in the racklike bunk 
the sound of heavy breathing increase steadily light be put out and before the afterglow have fade from the sky the gang be asleep 
vanamee however remain awake 
the night be fine warm the sky silvergrey with starlight 
by and by there would be a moon 
in the first watch after the twilight a faint puff of breeze come up out of the south 
from all around the heavy penetrating smell of the newturned earth exhale steadily into the darkness 
after a while when the moon come up -PRON- could see the vast brown breast of the earth turn toward -PRON- 
far off distant object come into view the giant oak tree at ranch house near the irrigating ditch on los muerto the skeletonlike tower of the windmill on home ranch the clump of willow along broderson creek close to the long trestle and last of all the venerable tower of the mission of san juan on the high ground beyond the creek 
thitherward like home pigeon thought turn irresistibly 
near to that tower just beyond in the little hollow hide now from -PRON- sight be the seed ranch where angele varian have live 
strain -PRON- eye peer across the intervene level vanamee fancy -PRON- could almost see the line of venerable pear tree in whose shadow -PRON- have be accustom to wait for -PRON- 
on many such a night as this -PRON- have cross the ranch to find -PRON- there 
-PRON- mind go back to that wonderful time of -PRON- life sixteen year before this when angele be alive when -PRON- two be involve in the sweet intricacy of a love so fine so pure so marvellous that -PRON- seem to -PRON- a miracle a manifestation a thing veritably divine put into the life of -PRON- and the heart of -PRON- by god -PRON- 
to that -PRON- have be bear 
for this love sake -PRON- have come into the world and the mingling of -PRON- life be to be the perfect life the intend ordain union of the soul of man with the soul of woman indissoluble harmonious as music beautiful beyond all think a foretaste of heaven a hostage of immortality 
no -PRON- vanamee could never never forget never be the edge of -PRON- grief to lose -PRON- sharpness never would the lapse of time blunt the tooth of -PRON- pain 
once more as -PRON- sit there look off across the ranch -PRON- eye fix on the ancient campanile of the mission church the anguish that would not die leap at -PRON- throat tear at -PRON- heart shake -PRON- and rend -PRON- with a violence as fierce and as profound as if -PRON- all have be but yesterday 
the ache return to -PRON- heart a physical keen pain -PRON- hand grip tight together twist interlock -PRON- eye fill with tear -PRON- whole body shake and riven from head to heel 
-PRON- have lose -PRON- 
god have not mean -PRON- after all 
the whole matter have be a mistake 
that vast wonderful love that have come upon -PRON- have be only the flimsy mockery 
abruptly vanamee rise 
-PRON- know the night that be before -PRON- 
at interval throughout the course of -PRON- prolong wandering in the desert on the mesa deep in the canon lose and forget on the flank of unnamed mountain alone under the star and under the moon white eye these hour come to -PRON- -PRON- grief recoil upon -PRON- like the recoil of a vast and terrible engine 
then -PRON- must fight out the night wrestle with -PRON- sorrow pray sometimes incoherent hardly conscious asking why of the night and of the star 
such another night have come to -PRON- now 
until dawn -PRON- know -PRON- must struggle with -PRON- grief tear with memory -PRON- imagination assault with vision of a vanished happiness 
if this paroxysm of sorrow be to assail -PRON- again that night there be but one place for -PRON- to be 
-PRON- would go to the would see father sarria -PRON- would pass the night in the deep shadow of the aged pear tree in the mission garden 
-PRON- strike out across quien sabe -PRON- face the face of an ascetic lean brown infinitely sad set toward the mission church 
in about an hour -PRON- reach and cross the road that lead northward from guadalajara toward the seed ranch and a little farther on forded broderson creek where -PRON- run through one corner of the mission land 
-PRON- climb the hill and halt out of breath from -PRON- brisk wall at the end of the colonnade of the mission -PRON- 
until this moment vanamee have not trust -PRON- to see the mission at night 
on the occasion of -PRON- first daytime visit with presley -PRON- have hurry away even before the twilight have set in not dare for the moment to face the crowd phantom that in -PRON- imagination fill the mission garden after dark 
in the daylight the place have seem strange to -PRON- 
none of -PRON- association with the old building and -PRON- surrounding be those of sunlight and brightness 
whenever during -PRON- long sojourn in the wilderness of the southwest -PRON- have call up the picture in the eye of -PRON- mind -PRON- have always appear to -PRON- in the dim mystery of moonless night the venerable pear tree black with shadow the fountain a thing to be hear rather than see 
but as yet -PRON- have not enter the garden 
that lie on the other side of the mission 
vanamee pass down the colonnade with -PRON- uneven pavement of worn red brick to the last door by the belfry tower and rang the little bell by pull the leather thong that hang from a hole in the door above the knob 
but the maidservant who after a long interval open the door blink and confuse at be rouse from -PRON- sleep tell vanamee that sarria be not in -PRON- room 
vanamee however be know to -PRON- as the priest protege and great friend and -PRON- allow -PRON- to enter tell -PRON- that no doubt -PRON- would find sarria in the church -PRON- 
the servant lead the way down the cool adobe passage to a large room that occupy the entire width of the bottom of the belfry tower and whence a flight of aged step lead upward into the dark 
at the foot of the stair be a door open into the church 
the servant admit vanamee close the door behind -PRON- 
the interior of the mission a great oblong of whitewash adobe with a flat ceiling be light dimly by the sanctuary lamp that hang from three long chain just over the chancel rail at the far end of the church and by two or three cheap kerosene lamp in bracket of imitation bronze 
all around the wall be the inevitable series of picture represent the station of the cross 
-PRON- be of a hideous crudity of design and composition yet be work out with an innocent unquestioning sincerity that be not without -PRON- charm 
each picture frame alike in gilt bear -PRON- suitable inscription in stare black letter 
simon the cyrenean help jesus to carry -PRON- cross 
saint veronica wipe the face of jesus 
jesus fall for the fourth time and so on up the length of the church the pew begin coffinlike box of blacken oak shine from year of friction each with -PRON- door while over -PRON- and build out from the wall be the pulpit with -PRON- tarnished gilt soundingboard above -PRON- like the raise cover of a great hatbox 
between the pew in the aisle the violent vermilion of a strip of ingrain carpet assault the eye 
farther on be the step to the altar the chancel rail of wormriddle oak the high altar with -PRON- napery from the bargain counter of a san francisco store the massive silver candlestick each as much as one man could lift the gift of a dead spanish queen and last the picture of the chancel the virgin in a glory a christ in agony on the cross and st john the baptist the patron saint of the mission the san juan bautista of the early day a gaunt grey figure in skin two finger upraised in the gesture of benediction 
the air of the place be cool and damp and heavy with the flat sweet scent of stale incense smoke 
-PRON- be of a vaultlike stillness and the closing of the door behind vanamee reecho from corner to corner with a prolonged reverberation of thunder 
however father sarria be not in the church 
vanamee take a couple of turn the length of the aisle look about into the chapel on either side of the chancel 
but the building be desert 
the priest have be there recently nevertheless for the altar furniture be in disarray as though -PRON- have be rearrange -PRON- but a moment before 
on both side of the church and halfway up -PRON- length the wall be pierce by low archway in which be massive wooden door clamp with iron bolt 
one of these door on the pulpit side of the church stand ajar and step to -PRON- and push -PRON- wide open vanamee look diagonally across a little patch of vegetablesbeet radish and the rear of the building that have once contain the cloister and through an open window see father sarria diligently polish the silver crucifix that usually stand on the high altar 
vanamee do not call to the priest 
put a finger to either temple -PRON- fix -PRON- eye steadily upon -PRON- for a moment as -PRON- move about at -PRON- work 
in a few second -PRON- close -PRON- eye but only part way 
the pupil contract -PRON- forehead lower to an expression of poignant intensity 
soon afterward -PRON- see the priest pause abruptly in the act of draw the cover over the crucifix look about -PRON- from side to side 
-PRON- turn again to -PRON- work and again come to a stop perplex curious 
with uncertain step and evidently wonder why -PRON- do so -PRON- come to the door of the room and open -PRON- look out into the night 
vanamee hide in the deep shadow of the archway do not move but -PRON- eye close and the intense expression deepen on -PRON- face 
the priest hesitate move forward a step turn back paused again then come straight across the garden patch brusquely collide with vanamee still motionless in the recess of the archway 
sarria give a great start catch -PRON- breath -PRON- -PRON- 
be -PRON- -PRON- i hear call 
no i could not have remember now 
what a strange power 
i be not sure that -PRON- be right to do this thing vanamee to come 
i do not know why 
-PRON- be a great donot like -PRON- 
vanamee sometimes -PRON- frighten -PRON- 
vanamee put -PRON- chin in the air 
if i have want to sir i could have make -PRON- come to -PRON- from back there in the quien sabe ranch 
the priest shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- trouble -PRON- -PRON- say to think that -PRON- own will can count for so little 
just now i could not resist 
if a deep river have be between -PRON- i must have cross -PRON- 
suppose i have be asleep now 
-PRON- would have be all the easier answer vanamee understand as little of these thing as -PRON- 
but i think if -PRON- have be asleep -PRON- power of resistance would have be so much the more weakened 
perhaps i should not have wake 
perhaps i should have come to -PRON- in -PRON- sleep 
perhaps 
sarria cross -PRON- 
-PRON- be occult -PRON- hazard 
no i do not like -PRON- 
dear fellow -PRON- put -PRON- hand on shoulder -PRON- that way again promise 
see -PRON- hold out -PRON- hand be all of a tremble 
there -PRON- wonot speak of -PRON- further 
wait for -PRON- a moment 
i have only to put the cross in -PRON- place and a fresh altar cloth and then i be do be the feast of the holy cross and i be prepare against -PRON- 
the night be fine 
-PRON- will smoke a cigar in the cloister garden 
a few moment later the two pass out of the door on the other side of the church opposite the pulpit sarria adjust a silk skull cap on -PRON- tonsured head 
-PRON- wear -PRON- cassock now and be far more the churchman in appearance than when vanamee and presley have see -PRON- on a former occasion 
-PRON- be now in the cloister garden 
the place be charm 
everywhere grow clump of palm and magnolia tree 
a grapevine over a century old occupy a trellis in one angle of the wall which surround the garden on two side 
along the third side be the church -PRON- while the fourth be open the wall have crumble away -PRON- site mark only by a line of eight great pear tree older even than the grapevine gnarl twisted bear no fruit 
directly opposite the pear tree in the south wall of the garden be a round arch portal whose gate give upon the esplanade in front of the mission be always close 
small gravel walk well keep border with mignonette twist about among the flower bed and underneath the magnolia tree 
in the centre be a little fountain in a stone basin green with moss while just beyond between the fountain and the pear tree stand what be leave of a sun dial the bronze gnomon green with the beating of the weather the figure on the halfcircle of the dial wear away illegible 
but on the other side of the fountain and directly opposite the door of the mission range against the wall be nine with headstone the rest with slab 
two of predecessor be bury here three of the grave be those of mission indian 
one be think to contain a former alcalde of guadalajara two more hold the body of de la cuesta and -PRON- young wife take with -PRON- to the grave the illusion of -PRON- husband love and the last one the ninth at the end of the line near the pear tree be mark by a little headstone the small of any on which together with the proper sixteen year cut the name angele varian 
but the quiet the repose the isolation of the little cloister garden be infinitely delicious 
-PRON- be a tiny corner of the great valley that stretch in all direction around off discreet romantic a garden of dream of enchantment of illusion 
outside there far off the great grim world go clash through -PRON- groove but in here never an echo of the grinding of -PRON- wheel enter to jar upon the subdued modulation of the fountain uninterrupted murmur 
sarria and vanamee find -PRON- way to a stone bench against the side wall of the mission near the door from which -PRON- have just issue and sit down sarria light a cigar vanamee rolling and smoke cigarette in mexican fashion 
all about -PRON- widen the vast calm night 
all the star be out 
the moon be come up 
there be no wind no sound 
the insistent flowing of the fountain seem only as the symbol of the passing of time a thing that be understand rather than hear inevitable prolong 
at long interval a faint breeze hardly more than a breath find -PRON- way into the garden over the enclose wall and pass overhead spread everywhere the delicious mingled perfume of magnolia blossom of mignonette of moss of grass and all the calm green life silently teem within the enclosure of the wall 
from where -PRON- sit vanamee turn -PRON- head could look out underneath the pear tree to the north 
close at hand a little valley lay between the high ground on which the mission be build and the line of low hill just beyond broderson creek on the quien sabe 
in here be the seed ranch which people have cultivate a unique and beautiful stretch of five hundred acre plant thick with rose violet lily tulip iris carnation tuberose poppy manner and description of flower five hundred acre of -PRON- solid thick exuberant blooming and fading and leave -PRON- seed or slip to be market broadcast all over the united state 
this have be the vocation of flower for -PRON- seed 
all over the country the seed ranch be know 
now -PRON- be arid almost dry but when in full flower toward the middle of summer the sight of these halfthousand acre royal with colourvermilion azure flame a marvel 
when an east wind blow man on the street of bonneville nearly twelve mile away could catch the scent of this valley of flower this chaos of perfume 
and into this life of flower this world of colour this atmosphere oppressive and clog and cloy and thicken with sweet odour angele have be bear 
there -PRON- have live -PRON- sixteen year 
there -PRON- have die 
-PRON- be not surprising that vanamee with -PRON- intense delicate sensitiveness to beauty -PRON- almost abnormal capacity for great happiness have be draw to -PRON- have love -PRON- so deeply 
-PRON- come to -PRON- from out of the flower the smell of the rose in -PRON- hair of gold that hang in two straight plait on either side of -PRON- face the reflection of the violet in the profound dark blue of -PRON- eye perplex heavylidde almondshape oriental the aroma and the imperial red of the carnation in -PRON- lip with -PRON- almost egyptian fulness the whiteness of the lily the perfume of the lily and the lily slender balance grace in -PRON- neck 
-PRON- hand disengage the odour of the heliotrope 
the fold of -PRON- dress give off the enervate scent of poppy 
-PRON- foot be redolent of hyacinth 
for a long time after sit down upon the bench neither the priest nor vanamee speak 
but after a while sarria take -PRON- cigar from -PRON- lip say how still -PRON- be 
this be a beautiful old garden peaceful very quiet 
some day i shall be bury here 
i like to remember that and -PRON- too vanamee 
quien sabe 
yes -PRON- too 
where else 
no -PRON- be well here yond by the side of the little girl be not able to look forward yet sir 
the thing that be to be be somehow nothing to -PRON- at all 
for -PRON- -PRON- amount to nothing 
-PRON- amount to everything -PRON- boy 
yes to one part of -PRON- but not to the part of -PRON- that belong to good part 
oh -PRON- donot know -PRON- exclaim with a sudden movement no one can understand 
what be -PRON- to -PRON- when -PRON- tell -PRON- that sometime after i shall die too somewhere in a vague place -PRON- call heaven i shall see -PRON- again 
do -PRON- think that the idea of that ever make any one sorrow easy to bear 
ever take the edge from any one grief 
but -PRON- believe that oh believe believe echo the other 
what do i believe 
i donot know 
i believe or i donot believe 
i can remember what -PRON- but i can not hope what -PRON- will be 
hope after all be only memory see reverse 
when i try to see -PRON- in another -PRON- call the vague place of -PRON- when i try to see -PRON- there -PRON- come to -PRON- imagination only as what -PRON- be material earthly as i love -PRON- 
imperfect -PRON- say but that be as i see -PRON- and as i see -PRON- i love -PRON- and as -PRON- material earthly imperfect -PRON- love -PRON- that that i want -PRON- exclaim donot want -PRON- change 
i donot want -PRON- spiritualise exalt glorify celestial 
i want i think -PRON- be only this feeling that have keep -PRON- from kill -PRON- 
i would rather be unhappy in the memory of what -PRON- actually be than be happy in the realisation of -PRON- transform change make celestial 
i be only human 
-PRON- soul 
that be beautiful no doubt 
but again -PRON- be something very vague intangible hardly more than a phrase 
but the touch of -PRON- hand be real the sound of -PRON- voice be real the clasp of -PRON- arm about -PRON- neck be real 
oh -PRON- cry shake with a sudden wrench of passion give those back to -PRON- 
tell -PRON- god to give those back to sound of -PRON- voice the touch of -PRON- hand the clasp of -PRON- dear arm and then -PRON- may talk to -PRON- of heaven 
sarria shake -PRON- head 
but when -PRON- meet -PRON- again -PRON- observe in heaven -PRON- too will be change 
-PRON- will see -PRON- spiritualise with spiritual eye 
as -PRON- be now -PRON- do not appeal to -PRON- 
i understand that 
-PRON- be because as -PRON- say -PRON- be only human while -PRON- be divine 
but when -PRON- come to be like -PRON- as -PRON- be now -PRON- will know -PRON- as -PRON- really be not as -PRON- seem to be because -PRON- voice be sweet because -PRON- hair be pretty because -PRON- hand be warm in yours 
vanamee -PRON- talk be that of a foolish child 
-PRON- be like one of the corinthian to whom paul write 
do -PRON- remember 
listen now 
i can recall the word and such word beautiful and terrible at the same time such a majesty 
-PRON- march like soldier with trumpet 
but some man will -PRON- have say just be the dead raise up 
and with what body do -PRON- come 
thou fool 
that which thou sowest be not quicken except -PRON- die and that which thou sow thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain 
-PRON- may chance of wheat or of some other grain 
but god giveth -PRON- a body as -PRON- hath please -PRON- and to every seed -PRON- own body 
-PRON- be sow a natural body -PRON- be raise a spiritual body 
-PRON- be because -PRON- be a natural body that -PRON- can not understand -PRON- nor wish for -PRON- as a spiritual body but when -PRON- be both spiritual then -PRON- shall know each other as -PRON- as -PRON- never know before 
-PRON- grain of wheat be -PRON- symbol of immortality 
-PRON- bury -PRON- in the earth 
-PRON- die and rise again a thousand time more beautiful 
vanamee -PRON- dear girl be only a grain of humanity that -PRON- have bury here and the end be not yet 
but all this be so old so old 
the world learn -PRON- a thousand year ago and yet each man that have ever stand by the open grave of any one -PRON- love must learn -PRON- all over again from the beginning 
vanamee be silent for a moment look off with unseeing eye between the trunk of the pear tree over the little valley 
that may all be as -PRON- say -PRON- answer after a while have not learn -PRON- yet in any case 
now i only know that i love heroh as if -PRON- all be that i be suffer suffering always 
-PRON- lean forward -PRON- head support on -PRON- clench fist the infinite sadness of -PRON- face deepen like a shadow the tear brim in -PRON- deepset eye 
a question that -PRON- must ask which involve the thing that be scarcely to be think of occur to -PRON- at this moment 
after hesitate for a long moment -PRON- say have be away a long time and i have have no news of this place since i leave 
be there anything to tell father 
have any discovery be make any suspicion develop as other 
the priest shake -PRON- head 
not a word not a whisper 
-PRON- be a mystery 
-PRON- always will be 
vanamee clasp -PRON- head between -PRON- clench fist rock -PRON- to and fro 
oh the terror of -PRON- -PRON- murmur 
the horror of -PRON- 
and of -PRON- sarria only sixteen a little girl so innocent that -PRON- never know what wrong mean pure as a little child be pure who believe that all thing be good mature only in -PRON- love 
and to be strike down like that while -PRON- god look down from heaven and would not take -PRON- part 
all at once -PRON- seem to lose control of -PRON- 
one of those fury of impotent grief and wrath that assail -PRON- from time to time blind insensate incoherent suddenly take possession of -PRON- 
a torrent of word issue from -PRON- lip and -PRON- fling out an arm the fist clench in a fierce quick gesture partly of despair partly of defiance partly of supplication 
no -PRON- god would not take -PRON- part 
where be mercy in that 
where be protection in that 
where be the love kindness -PRON- preach about 
why do god give -PRON- life if -PRON- be to be stamp out 
why do god give -PRON- the power of love if -PRON- be to come to nothing 
sarria listen to -PRON- 
why do god make -PRON- so divinely pure if -PRON- permit that abomination 
ha -PRON- exclaim bitterly -PRON- god 
why an apache buck would have be more merciful 
-PRON- god 
there be no god 
there be only the devil 
the heaven -PRON- pray to be only a joke a wretched trick a delusion 
-PRON- be only hell that be real 
sarria catch -PRON- by the arm 
-PRON- be a fool and a child -PRON- exclaim and -PRON- be blasphemy that -PRON- be say 
i forbid -PRON- 
-PRON- understand 
i forbid -PRON- 
vanamee turn on -PRON- with a sudden cry 
then tell -PRON- god to give -PRON- back to -PRON- 
sarria start away from -PRON- -PRON- eye widen in astonishment surprise out of all composure by the other outburst swarthy face be pale the sunken cheek and deepset eye be mark with great black shadow 
the priest no longer recognise -PRON- 
the face that face of the ascetic lean frame in -PRON- long black hair and pointed beard be quiver with the excitement of hallucination 
-PRON- be the face of the inspire shepherd of the hebraic legend live close to nature the young prophet of israel dweller in the wilderness solitary imaginative believe in the vision have strange delusion gift with strange power 
in a brief second of thought sarria understand 
out into the wilderness the vast arid desert of the southw vanamee have carry -PRON- grief 
for day for week month even -PRON- have be alone a solitary speck lose in the immensity of the horizon continually -PRON- be brood haunted with -PRON- sorrow thinking thinking often hard put to -PRON- for food 
the body be illnourishe and the mind concentrate forever upon one subject have recoil upon -PRON- have prey upon the naturally nervous temperament till the imagination have become exalt morbidly active diseased beset with hallucination forever in search of the manifestation of the miracle 
-PRON- be small wonder that bring a fancy so distort back to the scene of a vanished happiness vanamee should be rack with the most violent illusion beset in the throe of a veritable hysteria 
tell -PRON- god to give -PRON- back to -PRON- -PRON- repeat with fierce insistence 
-PRON- be the pitch of mysticism the imagination harass and goad beyond the normal round suddenly flip from the circumference spin off at a tangent out into the void where all thing seem possible hurtle through the dark there grope for the supernatural clamouring for the miracle 
and -PRON- be also the human natural protest against the inevitable the irrevocable the spasm of revolt under the sting of death the rebellion of the soul at the victory of the grave 
-PRON- can give -PRON- back to -PRON- if -PRON- only will vanamee cry 
sarria -PRON- must help -PRON- 
i tell warn -PRON- sir i canot last much longer under -PRON- 
-PRON- head be all wrong with no more hold on -PRON- mind 
something must happen or i shall lose -PRON- sense 
i be break down under -PRON- all -PRON- body and -PRON- mind alike 
bring -PRON- to -PRON- make god show -PRON- to -PRON- 
if all tale be true -PRON- would not be the first time 
if i can not have -PRON- at least let -PRON- see -PRON- as -PRON- be real earthly not -PRON- spirit -PRON- ghost 
i want -PRON- real self undefile again 
if this be dementia then let -PRON- be demente 
but help -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- god create the delusion do the miracle 
stop cry the priest again shake -PRON- roughly by the shoulder 
stop 
be -PRON- 
this be dementia but i shall let -PRON- be demente 
think of what -PRON- be say 
bring -PRON- back to -PRON- 
be that the way of god 
i think -PRON- be a man this be the talk of a weakminded girl 
vanamee stir abruptly in -PRON- place draw a long breath and look about -PRON- vaguely as if -PRON- come to -PRON- 
-PRON- be right -PRON- mutter hardly know what i be say at time 
but there be moment when -PRON- whole mind and soul seem to rise up in rebellion against what have happen when -PRON- seem to -PRON- that i be strong than death and that if i only know how to use the strength of -PRON- will concentrate -PRON- power of i donot call -PRON- backbutsomethe diseased and distorted mind be capable of hallucination if that be what -PRON- mean observed sarria 
perhaps that be what i mean 
perhaps i want only the delusion after all 
sarria do not reply and there be a long silence 
in the damp south corner of the wall a frog begin to croak at exact interval 
the little fountain ripple monotonously and a magnolia flower drop from one of the tree fall straight as a plummet through the motionless air and settle upon the gravel walk with a faint rustling sound 
otherwise the stillness be profound 
a little later the priest cigar long since out slip from -PRON- finger to the ground 
-PRON- begin to nod gently 
vanamee touch -PRON- arm 
asleep sir 
the other start rub -PRON- eye 
upon -PRON- word i believe i be 
better go to bed sir 
i be not tired 
i think i shall sit out here a little long 
well perhaps i would be well off in bed bed be always ready for -PRON- here whenever -PRON- want to use -PRON- shall go back to quien sir -PRON- boy 
vanamee be leave alone 
for a long time -PRON- sit motionless in -PRON- place -PRON- elbow on -PRON- knee -PRON- chin prop in -PRON- hand 
the minute the hour 
the moon climb steadily higher among the star 
vanamee roll and smoked cigarette after cigarette the blue haze of smoke hang motionless above -PRON- head or drift in slowly weave filament across the open space of the garden 
but the influence of the old enclosure this corner of romance and mystery this isolated garden of dream savouring of the past with -PRON- legend -PRON- grave -PRON- crumble sun dial -PRON- fountain with -PRON- rime of moss be not to be resist 
now that the priest have leave -PRON- the same exaltation of spirit that have seize upon vanamee earlier in the evening by degree grow big again in -PRON- mind and imagination 
-PRON- sorrow assault -PRON- like the flagellation of a fine whiplash and -PRON- love for angele rise again in -PRON- heart -PRON- seem to -PRON- never so deep so tender so infinitely strong 
no doubt -PRON- be -PRON- familiarity with the mission garden -PRON- clearcut remembrance of -PRON- as -PRON- be in the day when -PRON- have meet angele there tally now so exactly with the reality there under -PRON- eye that bring -PRON- to -PRON- imagination so vividly 
as yet -PRON- dare not trust -PRON- near -PRON- grave but for the moment -PRON- rise and -PRON- hand clasp behind -PRON- walk slowly from point to point amid the tiny gravel walk recall the incident of eighteen year ago 
on the bench -PRON- have quit -PRON- and angele have often sit 
here by the crumble sun dial -PRON- recall the night when -PRON- have kiss -PRON- for the first time 
here again by the rim of the fountain with -PRON- fringe of green -PRON- once have pause and bare -PRON- arm to the shoulder have thrust -PRON- deep into the water and then withdraw -PRON- have give -PRON- to -PRON- to kiss all wet and cool and here at last under the shadow of the pear tree -PRON- have sit evening after evening look off over the little valley below -PRON- watch the night build -PRON- domelike from horizon to zenith 
brusquely vanamee turn away from the prospect 
the seed ranch be dark at this time of the year and flowerless 
far off toward -PRON- centre -PRON- have catch a brief glimpse of the house where angele have live and a faint light burn in -PRON- window 
but -PRON- turn from -PRON- sharply 
the deepseate travail of -PRON- grief abruptly reach the paroxysm 
with long stride -PRON- cross the garden and reentere the mission church -PRON- plunge into the coolness of -PRON- atmosphere as into a bath 
what -PRON- search for -PRON- do not know or rather do not define 
-PRON- know only that -PRON- be suffer that a longing for angele for some object around which -PRON- great love could enfold -PRON- be tear at -PRON- heart with iron tooth 
-PRON- be ready to be delude crave the hallucination beg pitifully for the illusion anything rather than the empty tenantless night the voiceless silence the vast loneliness of the overspanning arc of the heaven 
before the chancel rail of the altar under the sanctuary lamp vanamee sink upon -PRON- knee -PRON- arm fold upon the rail -PRON- head bow down upon -PRON- 
-PRON- pray with what word -PRON- could not say for what -PRON- do not help merely for relief for an answer to -PRON- cry 
-PRON- be upon that at length that -PRON- disordered mind concentrate -PRON- an demand -PRON- implore an answer 
not a vague visitation of grace not a formless sense of peace but an answer something real even if the reality be fancy a voice out of the night respond to -PRON- a hand in the dark clasp -PRON- grope finger a breath human warm fragrant familiar like a soft sweet caress on -PRON- shrunken cheek 
alone there in the dim halflight of the decay mission with -PRON- crumble plaster -PRON- naive crudity of ornament and picture -PRON- wrestle fiercely with -PRON- desiresword fragment of sentence inarticulate incoherent wrench from -PRON- tightshut tooth 
but the answer be not in the church 
above -PRON- over the high altar the virgin in a glory with downcast eye and fold hand grow vague and indistinct in the shadow the colour fade tarnish by century of incense smoke 
the christ in agony on the cross be but a lamentable vision of torment anatomy grey flesh spot with crimson 
the st john the san juan bautista patron saint of the mission the gaunt figure in skin two finger upraised in the gesture of benediction gaze stolidly out into the halfgloom under the ceiling ignore the human distress that beat -PRON- in vain against the altar rail below and angele remain as a memory far distant intangible lose 
vanamee rise turn -PRON- back upon the altar with a vague gesture of despair 
-PRON- cross the church and issue from the lowarched door opposite the pulpit once more step out into the garden 
here at least be reality 
the warm still air descend upon -PRON- like a cloak grateful comforting dispel the chill that lurk in the damp mould of plaster and crumble adobe 
but now -PRON- find -PRON- way across the garden on the other side of the fountain where range against the eastern wall be nine grave 
here angele be bury in the small grave of -PRON- all mark by the little headstone with -PRON- two date only sixteen year apart 
to this spot at last -PRON- have return after the year spend in the desert the all the wandering of the long trail 
here if ever -PRON- must have a sense of -PRON- nearness 
close at hand a short four foot under that mound of grass be the form -PRON- have so often hold in the embrace of -PRON- arm the face the very face -PRON- have kiss that face with the hair of gold making threecornere the round white forehead the violetblue eye heavylidde with -PRON- strange oriental slant upward toward the temple the sweet full lip almost egyptian in -PRON- that strange perplex wonderful beauty so troublous so enchant so out of all accept standard 
-PRON- bend down drop upon one knee a hand upon the headstone and read again the inscription 
then instinctively -PRON- hand leave the stone and rest upon the low mound of turf touch -PRON- with the softness of a caress and then before -PRON- be aware of -PRON- -PRON- be stretch at full length upon the earth beside the grave -PRON- arm about the low mound -PRON- lip press against the grass with which -PRON- be cover 
the pentup grief of nearly twenty year rise again within -PRON- heart and overflow irresistible violent passionate 
there be no one to see no one to hear 
vanamee have no thought of restraint 
-PRON- no longer wrestle with -PRON- against -PRON- 
there be even a sense of relief in permit -PRON- to be overcome 
but the reaction from this outburst be equally violent 
-PRON- revolt against the inevitable -PRON- protest against the grave shake -PRON- from head to foot goad -PRON- beyond all bound of reason hound -PRON- on and into the domain of hysteria dementia 
vanamee be no longer master of longer know what -PRON- be do 
at first -PRON- have be content with merely a wild unreasoned cry to heaven that angele should be restore to -PRON- but the vast egotism that seem to run through all form of disordered intelligence give -PRON- fancy another turn 
-PRON- forget god 
-PRON- no longer reckon with heaven 
-PRON- arrogate -PRON- power to to be of -PRON- own unaided may strong than death more powerful than the grave 
-PRON- have demand of sarria that god should restore angele to -PRON- but now -PRON- appeal directly to angele -PRON- 
as -PRON- lie there -PRON- arm clasp about -PRON- grave -PRON- seem so near to -PRON- that -PRON- fancy -PRON- hear 
and suddenly at this moment -PRON- recollection of -PRON- strange compelling same power by which -PRON- have call presley to -PRON- halfway across the quien sabe ranch the same power which have bring sarria to -PRON- side that very to -PRON- 
concentrate -PRON- mind upon the one object with which -PRON- have so long be fill vanamee -PRON- eye close -PRON- face bury in -PRON- arm exclaim come to -PRON- hear 
come to -PRON- 
but the answer be not in the grave 
below -PRON- the voiceless earth lie silent moveless withhold the secret jealous of that which -PRON- hold so close in -PRON- grip refuse to give up that which have be confide to -PRON- keeping untouched by the human anguish that above there on -PRON- surface clutch with despair hand at a grave long make 
the earth that only that morning have be so eager so responsive to the light summon so vibrant with life now at night hold death within -PRON- embrace guarding inviolate the secret of the grave be deaf to all entreaty refuse the answer and angele remain as before only a memory far distant intangible lose 
vanamee lift -PRON- head look about -PRON- with unseeing eye tremble with the exertion of -PRON- vain effort 
but -PRON- could not as yet allow -PRON- to despair 
never before have that curious power of attraction fail -PRON- 
-PRON- feel -PRON- to be so strong in this respect that -PRON- be persuade if -PRON- exert -PRON- to the limit of -PRON- capacity could not say come of -PRON- 
if -PRON- be only a selfdelusion an hallucination -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- would be content 
almost of -PRON- own accord -PRON- distorted mind concentrate -PRON- again every think all the power of -PRON- will rivet -PRON- upon angele 
as if -PRON- be alive -PRON- summon -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- eye fix upon the name cut into the headstone contract the pupil grow small -PRON- fist shut tight -PRON- nerve brace rigid 
for a few second -PRON- stand thus breathless expectant await the manifestation the miracle 
then without know why hardly conscious of what be transpire -PRON- find that -PRON- glance be leave the headstone be turn from the grave 
not only this but -PRON- whole body be follow the direction of -PRON- eye 
before -PRON- know -PRON- -PRON- be stand with -PRON- back to grave be face the north face the line of pear tree and the little valley where the seed ranch lie 
at first -PRON- think this be because -PRON- have allow -PRON- will to weaken the concentrated power of -PRON- mind to grow slack 
and once more turn toward the grave -PRON- band all -PRON- thought together in a consummate effort -PRON- tooth grind together -PRON- hand press to -PRON- forehead 
-PRON- force -PRON- to the notion that angele be alive and to this creature of -PRON- imagination -PRON- address -PRON- angele -PRON- cry in a low voice angele i be call -PRON- hear 
come to to -PRON- now now 
instead of the answer -PRON- demand that inexplicable counterinfluence cut across the current of -PRON- thought 
strive as -PRON- would against -PRON- -PRON- must veer to the north toward the pear tree 
obey -PRON- -PRON- turn and still wonder take a step in that direction then another and another 
the next moment -PRON- come abruptly to -PRON- in the black shadow of the pear tree -PRON- and open -PRON- eye find -PRON- look off over the seed ranch toward the little house in the centre where angele have once live 
perplex -PRON- return to the grave once more call upon the resource of -PRON- will and abruptly so soon as these reach a certain point the same crosscurrent set in 
-PRON- could no longer keep -PRON- eye upon the headstone could no longer think of the grave and what -PRON- hold 
-PRON- must face the north -PRON- must be draw toward the pear tree and there leave stand in -PRON- shadow look out aimlessly over the seed ranch wonder bewilder 
farther than this the influence never draw -PRON- but up to this line of pear be not to be resist 
for a time the peculiarity of the affair be of more interest to vanamee than even -PRON- own distress of spirit and once or twice -PRON- repeat the attempt almost experimentally and invariably with the same result so soon as -PRON- seem to hold angele in the grip of -PRON- mind -PRON- be move to turn about toward the north and hurry toward the pear tree on the crest of the hill that overlook the little valley 
but unhappiness be too keen this night for -PRON- to dwell long upon the vagary of -PRON- mind 
submit at length and abandon the grave -PRON- fling -PRON- down in the black shade of the pear tree -PRON- chin in -PRON- hand and resign -PRON- finally and definitely to the inrush of recollection and the exquisite grief of an infinite regret 
to -PRON- fancy -PRON- come to -PRON- again 
-PRON- put -PRON- back many year 
-PRON- remember the warm night of july and august profoundly still the sky encrust with star the little mission garden exhale the mingle perfume that all through the scorch day have be distil under the steady blaze of a summer sun 
-PRON- see -PRON- as another person arrive at this -PRON- rendezvous 
all day long -PRON- have be in -PRON- mind 
all day long -PRON- have look forward to this quiet hour that belong to -PRON- 
-PRON- be dark 
-PRON- could see nothing but by and by -PRON- hear a step a gentle rustle of the grass on the slope of the hill press under an advance foot 
then -PRON- see the faint gleam of pallid gold of -PRON- hair a barely visible glow in the starlight and hear the murmur of -PRON- breath in the lapse of the overpassing breeze 
and then in the midst of the gentle perfume of the garden the perfume of the magnolia flower of the mignonette border of the crumble wall there expand a new odour or the faint mingling of many odour the smell of the rose that linger in -PRON- hair of the lily that exhale from -PRON- neck of the heliotrope that disengage -PRON- from -PRON- hand and arm and of the hyacinth with which -PRON- little foot be redolent and then suddenly -PRON- be eye heavylidde violet blue full of the love of -PRON- -PRON- sweet full lip speak -PRON- name -PRON- hand clasp -PRON- hand -PRON- shoulder -PRON- whole dear body give -PRON- into -PRON- embrace -PRON- lip against -PRON- -PRON- hand hold -PRON- head draw -PRON- face down to hers 
vanamee as -PRON- remember all this fling out an arm with a cry of pain -PRON- eye search the gloom all -PRON- mind in strenuous mutiny against the triumph of death 
-PRON- glance shoot swiftly out across the night unconsciously follow the direction from which angele use to come to -PRON- 
come to -PRON- now -PRON- exclaim under -PRON- breath tense and rigid with the vast futile effort of -PRON- will 
come to -PRON- now now -PRON- hear -PRON- angele 
-PRON- must -PRON- must come 
suddenly vanamee return to -PRON- with the abruptness of a blow 
-PRON- eye open 
-PRON- half raise -PRON- from the ground 
swiftly -PRON- scatter wit readjust -PRON- 
never more sane never more -PRON- -PRON- rise to -PRON- foot and stand look off into the night across the seed ranch 
what be -PRON- -PRON- murmur bewilder 
-PRON- look around -PRON- from side to side as if to get in touch with reality once more 
-PRON- look at -PRON- hand at the rough bark of the pear tree next which -PRON- stand at the streaked and rainerode wall of the mission and garden 
the exaltation of -PRON- mind calm -PRON- the unnatural strain under which -PRON- labour slacken 
-PRON- become thoroughly master of -PRON- again matteroffact practical keen 
but just so sure as -PRON- hand be -PRON- own just so sure as the bark of the pear tree be rough the moulder adobe of the mission wall so sure have something occur 
-PRON- be vague intangible appeal only to some strange nameless sixth sense but none the less perceptible 
-PRON- mind -PRON- imagination send out from -PRON- across the night across the little valley below -PRON- speed hither and thither through the dark lose confuse have suddenly pause hovering have find something 
-PRON- have not return to -PRON- emptyhande 
-PRON- have come back but now there be a changemysterious illusive 
there be no word for this that have transpire 
but for the moment one thing only be certain 
the night be no longer voiceless the dark be no longer empty 
far off there beyond the reach of vision unlocalise strange a ripple have form on the still black pool of the night have form flash one instant to the star then swiftly fade again 
the night shut down once more 
there be no stirred 
for the moment vanamee stand transfix strike rigid in -PRON- place stupefy -PRON- eye stare breathless with utter amazement 
then step by step -PRON- shrink back into the deep shadow tread with the infinite precaution of a prowling leopard 
a qualm of something very much like fear seize upon -PRON- 
but immediately on the heel of this first impression come the doubt of -PRON- own sense 
whatever have happen have be so ephemeral so faint so intangible that now -PRON- wonder if -PRON- have not deceive -PRON- after all 
but the reaction follow 
surely there have be something 
and from that moment begin for -PRON- the most poignant uncertainty of mind 
gradually -PRON- draw back into the garden hold -PRON- breath listen to every faint sound walk upon tiptoe 
-PRON- reach the fountain and wet -PRON- hand pass -PRON- across -PRON- forehead and eye 
once more -PRON- stand listen 
the silence be profound 
troubled disturb vanamee go away pass out of the garden descend the hill 
-PRON- ford broderson creek where -PRON- intersect the road to guadalajara and go on across quien sabe walk slowly -PRON- head bend down -PRON- hand clasp behind -PRON- back thoughtful perplexed 
at seven oclock in the bedroom of -PRON- ranch house in the whitepainted iron bedstead with -PRON- bluegrey army blanket and red counterpane annixter be still asleep -PRON- face red -PRON- mouth open -PRON- stiff yellow hair in wild disorder 
on the wooden chair at the bedhead stand the kerosene lamp by the light of which -PRON- have be read the previous evening 
beside -PRON- be a paper bag of dry prune and the limp volume of copperfield the place mark by a slip of paper tear from the edge of the bag 
annixter sleep soundly make great work of the business unable to take even -PRON- rest gracefully 
-PRON- eye be shut so tight that the skin at -PRON- angle be draw into pucker 
under -PRON- pillow -PRON- two hand be double up into fist 
at interval -PRON- grit -PRON- tooth ferociously while from time to time the abrupt sound of -PRON- snoring dominate the brisk ticking of the alarm clock that hang from the brass knob of the bedpost within six inch of -PRON- ear 
but immediately after seven this clock spring -PRON- alarm with the abruptness of an explosion and within the second annixter have hurl the bedclothe from -PRON- and fling -PRON- up to a sit posture on the edge of the bed pant and gasping blink at the light rub -PRON- head daze and bewilder stupefy at the hideous suddenness with which -PRON- have be wrench from -PRON- sleep 
-PRON- first act be to take down the alarm clock and stifle -PRON- prolonged whirring under the pillow and blanket 
but when this have be do -PRON- continue to sit stupidly on the edge of the bed curl -PRON- toe away from the cold of the floor -PRON- halfshut eye heavy with sleep fix and vacant closing and opening by turn 
for upward of three minute -PRON- alternately doze and wake -PRON- head and the whole upper half of -PRON- body sag abruptly sideways from moment to moment 
but at length come more to -PRON- -PRON- straighten up run -PRON- finger through -PRON- hair and with a prodigious yawn murmur vaguely oh lord 
-PRON- stretch three or four time twist about in -PRON- place curl and uncurl -PRON- toe mutter from time to time between two yawn oh lord 
oh lord 
-PRON- stare about the room collect -PRON- thought readjust -PRON- for the day work 
the room be barren the wall of brown and yellow the wall of a stable be adorn with two or three unframed lithograph the christmas souvenir of weekly periodical fasten with great wire nail a bunch of herb or flower lamentably wither and grey with dust be affix to the mirror over the black walnut washstand by the window and a yellowed photograph of combine and -PRON- man in a group before close at hand 
on the floor at the bedside and before the bureau be two oval ragcarpet rug 
in the corner of the room be muddy boot a saddle a surveyor transit an empty coalhod and a box of iron bolt and nut 
on the wall over the bed in a gilt frame be college diploma while on the bureau amid a litter of hairbrushes dirty collar drive glove cigar and the like stand a broken machine for loading shell 
-PRON- be essentially a man room rugge uncouth virile full of the odour of tobacco of leather of rusty iron the bare floor hollow by the grind of hobnail boot the wall mar by the friction of heavy thing of metal 
strangely enough clothe be dispose of on the single chair with the precision of an old maid 
thus -PRON- have place -PRON- the night before the boot set carefully side by side the trouser with the overall still upon -PRON- neatly fold upon the seat of the chair the coat hang from -PRON- back 
the quien sabe ranch house be a sixroom affair all on one floor 
by no excess of charity could -PRON- have be call a home 
annixter be a wealthy man -PRON- could have furnish -PRON- dwelling with quite as much elegance as that of magnus derrick 
as -PRON- be however -PRON- consider -PRON- house merely as a place to eat to sleep to change -PRON- clothe in as a shelter from the rain an office where business be more 
when -PRON- be sufficiently awake annixter thrust -PRON- foot into a pair of wicker slipper and shuffle across the office adjoin -PRON- bedroom to the bathroom just beyond and stand under the icy shower a few minute -PRON- tooth chatter fulminate oath at the coldness of the water 
still shiver -PRON- hurry into -PRON- clothe and have push the button of the electric bell to announce that -PRON- be ready for breakfast immediately plunge into the business of the day 
while -PRON- be thus occupy the butcher cart from bonneville drive into the yard with the day supply of meat 
this cart also bring the bonneville paper and the mail of the previous night 
in the bundle of correspondence that the butcher hand to annixter that morning be a telegram from osterman at that time on -PRON- second trip to los angele 
-PRON- read flotation of company in this district assure 
have secure service of desirable party 
be now in position to sell -PRON- -PRON- share stock as per original plan 
annixter grunt as -PRON- tear the despatch into strip 
well -PRON- mutter that part be settle then 
-PRON- make a little pile of the tear strip on the top of the unlighted stove and burn -PRON- carefully scowl down into the flicker of fire thoughtful and preoccupied 
-PRON- know very well what osterman refer to by flotation of company and also who be the desirable party -PRON- speak of 
under protest as -PRON- be particular to declare and after interminable argument annixter have allow -PRON- to be reconcile with osterman and to be persuade to reenter the propose political deal 
a committee have be form to finance the old broderson annixter -PRON- and with reservation hardly more than a lookeron harran derrick 
of this committee osterman be consider chairman 
magnus derrick have formally and definitely refuse -PRON- adherence to the scheme 
-PRON- be try to steer a middle course 
-PRON- position be difficult anomalous 
if freight rate be cut through the effort of the member of the committee -PRON- could not very well avoid take advantage of the new schedule 
-PRON- would be the gainer though share neither the risk nor the expense 
but meanwhile the day be pass the primary election be draw nearer 
the committee could not afford to wait and by way of a begin osterman have go to los angele fortify by a large sum of purse to which annixter broderson and -PRON- have contribute 
-PRON- have put -PRON- in touch with disbrow the political man of the denver pueblo and mojave road and have have two interview with -PRON- 
the telegram that annixter receive that morning be to say that disbrow have be buy over and would adopt parrell as the and candidate for railroad commissioner from the third district 
one of the cook bring up breakfast that morning and -PRON- go through -PRON- hastily read -PRON- mail at the same time and glance over the page of the mercury paper 
the mercury annixter be persuade receive a subsidy from the pacific and southwestern railroad and be hardly well than the mouthpiece by which shelgrim and the general office speak to rancher about bonneville 
an editorial in that morning issue say -PRON- would not be surprising to the wellinforme if the longdeferred regrade of the value of the railroad section include in the los muertos quien sabe osterman and broderson property be make before the first of the year 
naturally the tenant of these land feel an interest in the price which the railroad will put upon -PRON- holding and -PRON- be rumour -PRON- expect the land will be offer to -PRON- for two dollar and fifty cent per acre 
-PRON- need no seventh daughter of a seventh daughter to foresee that these gentleman will be disappoint 
rot vociferate annixter to -PRON- as -PRON- finish 
-PRON- roll the paper into a wad and hurl -PRON- from -PRON-

the road obligate 
and -PRON- improvement 
i make the land valuable by improve -PRON- irrigate -PRON- drain -PRON- and cultivate -PRON- 
talk to i know well 
the most abiding impression that editorial make upon -PRON- be that possibly the mercury be not subsidise by the corporation after all 
if -PRON- be genslinger would not have be lead into make -PRON- mistake as to the value of the land 
-PRON- would have know that the railroad be under contract to sell at two dollar and a half an acre and not only this but that when the land be put upon the market -PRON- be to be offer to the present holder first of all 
annixter call to mind the explicit term of the agreement between -PRON- and the railroad and dismiss the matter from -PRON- mind 
-PRON- light a cigar put on -PRON- hat and go out 
the morning be fine the air nimble brisk 
on the summit of the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well the windmill be turn steadily in a breeze from the southwest 
the water in the irrigate ditch be well up

maybe that s why i be afraid in the was 
i shouldnot like to think that anything could happen around -PRON- that i couldnot see or understand or explain 
-PRON- run on from subject to subject positively garrulous talking in -PRON- lowpitched voice of velvety huskiness for the mere enjoyment of put -PRON- idea into speech innocently assume that -PRON- be quite as interesting to other as to -PRON- 
-PRON- be yet a great child ignore the fact that -PRON- have ever grow up take a child interest in -PRON- immediate surrounding direct straightforward plain 
while speak -PRON- continue about -PRON- work rinse out the can with a mixture of hot water and soda scour -PRON- bright and pile -PRON- in the sunlight on top of the vat

the clumsiness that -PRON- usually experience in the presence of woman be wear off 
hilma direct simplicity put -PRON- at -PRON- ease 
-PRON- begin to wonder if -PRON- dare to kiss hilma and if -PRON- do dare how -PRON- would take -PRON- 
a spark of suspicion flicker up in -PRON- mind 
do not -PRON- manner imply vaguely an invitation

at all event one could but try 
but as yet -PRON- be not absolutely sure

-PRON- be waste half the morning 
yet if -PRON- want to give -PRON- the opportunity of kiss -PRON- and -PRON- fail to take advantage of -PRON- what a ninny -PRON- would think -PRON- -PRON- would despise -PRON- for be afraid

why -PRON- owe -PRON- to -PRON- as a man to go as far as -PRON- could 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that that goat osterman would have kiss hilma tree week ago to test -PRON- state of mind -PRON- imagine -PRON- as have decide to kiss -PRON- after all and at once be surprised to experience a poignant qualm of excitement -PRON- heart beat heavily -PRON- breath come short 
at the same time -PRON- courage remain with -PRON- 
-PRON- be not afraid to try 
-PRON- feel a great respect for -PRON- because of this 
-PRON- selfassurance harden within -PRON- and as hilma turn to -PRON- ask -PRON- to taste a cut from one of the ripe cheese -PRON- suddenly step close to -PRON- throw an arm about -PRON- shoulder advance -PRON- head

the thing be a failure and at once -PRON- realise that nothing have be further from mind than the idea of -PRON- kiss -PRON- 
-PRON- start back from -PRON- abruptly -PRON- hand nervously clasp against -PRON- breast drawing in -PRON- breath sharply and hold -PRON- with a little tremulous catch of the throat that send a quivering vibration the length of -PRON- smooth white neck 
-PRON- eye open wide with a childlike look more of astonishment than anger 
-PRON- be surprised out of all measure discountenance take all aback and when -PRON- find -PRON- breath give voice to a great oh of dismay and distress

the matter be interfere with -PRON- work 
this kind of thing be sure not earn any money 
-PRON- shake -PRON- as though free -PRON- shoulder of an irksome burden and turn -PRON- entire attention to the work near at hand 
the prolonged rattle of the shingler hammer upon the roof of the big barn attract -PRON- and cross over between the ranch house and the artesian well -PRON- stand for some time absorb in the contemplation of the vast building amuse and interested with the confusion of clatter of hammer the cadenced scrape of saw and the rhythmic shuffle of issue from the gang of carpenter who be at that moment put the finishing touch upon the roof and row of stall 
a boy and two man be busy hang the great sliding door at the south end while the down from bonneville early that engage in adjust the spray and force engine by mean of which annixter have insist upon paint the vast surface of the barn condemn the use of brush and pot for such work as oldfashione and outofdate

ach hilda leedle girl -PRON- cry hold tight bei der shdrap on 
hey hoop 
gedt oop -PRON- 
annixter canter on 
in a few moment -PRON- have cross broderson creek and have enter upon the home ranch of los muertos 
ahead of -PRON- but so far off that the great portion of -PRON- bulk be below the horizon -PRON- could see the derrick home a roof or two between the dull green of cypress and eucalyptus 
nothing else be in sight 
the brown earth smooth unbroken be as a limitless mudcoloured ocean 
the silence be profound 
then at length searching eye make out a blur on the horizon to the northward the blur concentrate -PRON- to a speck the speck grow by steady degree to a spot slowly move a note of dull colour barely dark than the land but an inky black silhouette as -PRON- top a low rise of ground and stand for a moment outline against the pale blue of the sky 
annixter turn -PRON- horse from the road and ride across the ranch land to meet this new object of interest 
as the spot grow large -PRON- resolve -PRON- into constituent a collection of unit -PRON- shape grow irregular fragmentary 
a disintegrated nebulous confusion advance toward annixter precede as -PRON- discover on nearer approach by a medley of faint sound 
now -PRON- be no longer a spot but a column a column that move accompany by spot 
as annixter lessen the distance these spot resolve -PRON- into buggy or man on horseback that keep pace with the advance column 
there be horse in the column -PRON- 
at first glance -PRON- appear as if there be nothing else a riderless squadron tramp steadily over the upturned plough land of the ranch 
but -PRON- draw nearer 
the horse be in line six abreast harness to machine 
the noise increase define -PRON- 
there be a shout or two occasionally a horse blow through -PRON- nostril with a prolonged vibrating snort 
the click and clink of metal work be incessant the machine throw off a continual rattle of wheel and cog and clash spring 
the column approach nearer be close at hand 
the noise mingle to a subdued uproar a bewilder confusion the impact of innumerable hoof be a veritable rumble 
machine after machine appear and annixter draw to one side remain for nearly ten minute watch and interested while like an array of chariotsclattere jostle creak clash an interminable procession machine succeed machine sixhorse team succeed sixhorse teambustling thirtythree grain drill each with -PRON- eight hoe go clamouring past like an advance of military seed the ten thousand acre of the great ranch fecundate the live soil implant deep in the dark womb of the earth the germ of life the sustenance of a whole world the food of an entire people 
when the drill have pass annixter turn and ride back to the low road over the land now thick with seed 
-PRON- do not wonder that the seeding on los muertos seem to be hastily conduct 
magnus and harran derrick have not yet be able to make up the time lose at the beginning of the season when -PRON- have wait so long for the ploughs to arrive 
-PRON- have be behindhand all the time 
on ranch the land have not only be harrow as well as seed but in some case crossharrowe as well 
the labour of put in the vast crop be over 
now there be nothing to do but wait while the seed silently germinate nothing to do but watch for the wheat to come up 
when annixter reach the ranch house of los muerto under the shade of the cypress and eucalyptus tree -PRON- find mrs derrick on the porch seat in a long wicker chair 
-PRON- have be wash -PRON- hair and the light brown lock that yet retain so much of -PRON- brightness be carefully spread in the sun over the back of -PRON- chair 
annixter could not but remark that spite of -PRON- more than fifty year annie derrick be yet rather pretty 
-PRON- eye be still those of a young girl just touch with an uncertain expression of innocence and inquiry but as -PRON- glance fall upon -PRON- -PRON- find that that expression change to one of uneasiness of distrust almost of aversion 
the night before this after magnus and -PRON- wife have go to bed -PRON- have lie awake for hour stare up into the dark talk talk 
magnus have not long be able to keep from -PRON- wife the news of the coalition that be form against the railroad nor the fact that this coalition be determine to gain -PRON- end by any mean at -PRON- command 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- of scheme of a fraudulent election to seat a board of railroad commissioner who should be nominee of the farming interest 
magnus and -PRON- wife have talk this matter over and over again and the same discussion begin immediately after supper the evening before have last till far into the night 
at once annie derrick have be seize with a sudden terror lest magnus after all should allow -PRON- to be persuade should yield to the pressure that be every day grow strong 
none well than -PRON- know the iron integrity of -PRON- husband character 
none well than -PRON- remember how -PRON- dear ambition that of political preferment have be thwart by -PRON- refusal to truckle to connive to compromise with -PRON- idea of right 
now at last there seem to be a change 
long continued oppression petty tyranny injustice and extortion have drive -PRON- to exasperation insult still rankle 
-PRON- seem nearly ready to countenance scheme 
the very fact that -PRON- be willing to talk of -PRON- to -PRON- so often and at such great length be proof positive that -PRON- occupy -PRON- mind 
the pity of -PRON- the tragedy of -PRON- 
-PRON- magnu the governor who have be so staunch so rigidly upright so loyal to -PRON- conviction so bitter in -PRON- denunciation of the new politic so scathe in -PRON- attack on bribery and corruption in high place be -PRON- possible that now at last -PRON- could be bring to withhold -PRON- condemnation of the devious intrigue of the unscrupulous go on there under -PRON- very eye 
that magnus should not command harran to refrain from all intercourse with the conspirator have be a matter of vast surprise to mrs derrick 
time be when magnu would have forbid -PRON- son to so much as recognise a dishonourable man 
but besides all this wife tremble at the thought of -PRON- husband and son engage in so desperate a grapple with the great monster ironhearte relentless infinitely powerful 
always -PRON- have issue triumphant from the fight always behrman the champion remain upon the field as victor placid unperturbe unassailable 
but now a more terrible struggle than any hitherto loom menace over the rim of the future money be to be spend like water personal reputation be to be hazard in the issue failure mean ruin in all direction financial ruin moral ruin ruin of prestige ruin of character 
success to -PRON- mind be almost impossible 
annie derrick fear the railroad 
at night when everything else be still the distant roar of pass train echo across los muertos from guadalajara from bonneville or from the long trestle straight into -PRON- heart 
at such moment -PRON- see very plainly the gallop terror of steam and steel with -PRON- single eye cyclopean red shooting from horizon to horizon symbol of a vast power huge and terrible the leviathan with tentacle of steel to oppose which mean to be grind to instant destruction beneath the clash wheel 
no -PRON- be well to submit to resign oneself to the inevitable 
-PRON- obliterate -PRON- shrink from the harshness of the world strive with vain hand to draw -PRON- husband back with -PRON- 
just before arrival -PRON- have be sit thoughtful in -PRON- long chair an open volume of poem turn down upon -PRON- lap -PRON- glance lose -PRON- in the immensity of los muertos that from the edge of the lawn close by unroll -PRON- gigantic toward the far southern horizon wrinkle and serrate after the season plough 
the earth hitherto grey with dust be now upturned and brown 
as far as the eye could reach -PRON- be empty of all life bare mournful absolutely still and as -PRON- look there seem to -PRON- morbid and disturb with long brooding sick with the monotony of repeat be disengage from all this immensity a sense of a vast oppression formless disquieting 
the terror of sheer bigness grow slowly in -PRON- mind loneliness beyond word gradually envelop -PRON- 
-PRON- be lose in all these limitless reach of space 
have -PRON- be abandon in midocean in an open boat -PRON- terror could hardly have be great 
-PRON- feel vividly that certain uncongeniality which when all be say forever remain between humanity and the earth which support -PRON- 
-PRON- recognise the colossal indifference of nature not hostile even kindly and friendly so long as the human antswarm be submissive work with -PRON- hurry along at -PRON- side in the mysterious march of the century 
let however the insect rebel strive to make head against the power of this nature and at once -PRON- become relentless a gigantic engine a vast power huge terrible a leviathan with a heart of steel know no compunction no forgiveness no tolerance crush out the human atom with sound less calm the agony of destruction send never a jar never the faint tremour through all that prodigious mechanism of wheel and cog 
such thought as these do not take shape distinctly in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- could not have tell -PRON- exactly what -PRON- be that disquiet -PRON- 
-PRON- only receive the vague sensation of these thing as -PRON- be a breath of wind upon -PRON- face confuse troublous an indefinite sense of hostility in the air 
the sound of hoof grind upon the gravel of the driveway bring -PRON- to -PRON- again and withdraw -PRON- gaze from the empty plain of los muerto -PRON- see young annixter stop -PRON- horse by the carriage step 
but the sight of -PRON- only divert -PRON- mind to the other trouble 
-PRON- could not but regard -PRON- with aversion 
-PRON- be one of the conspirator be one of the leader in the battle that impend no doubt -PRON- have come to make a fresh attempt to win over magnus to the unholy alliance 
however there be little trace of enmity in -PRON- greeting 
-PRON- hair be still spread like a broad patch of back and -PRON- make that -PRON- excuse for not get up 
in answer to embarrassed inquiry after magnus -PRON- send the chinese cook to call -PRON- from the office and annixter after tie -PRON- horse to the ring drive into the trunk of one of the eucalyptus tree come up to the porch and take off -PRON- hat sit down upon the step 
be harran anywhere about -PRON- ask like to see harran too 
no say mrs derrick harran go to bonneville early this morning 
-PRON- glance toward annixter nervously without turn -PRON- head lest -PRON- should disturb -PRON- outspread hair 
what be -PRON- -PRON- want to see mr derrick about -PRON- inquire hastily 
be -PRON- about this plan to elect a railroad commission 
magnus do not approve of -PRON- -PRON- declare with energy 
-PRON- tell -PRON- so last night 
annixter move about awkwardly where -PRON- sit smooth down with -PRON- hand the one stiff lock of yellow hair that persistently stand up from -PRON- crown like an scalplock 
at once -PRON- suspicion be all aroused 
ah this feemale woman be try to get a hold on -PRON- try to involve -PRON- in a petticoat mess try to cajole -PRON- 
upon the instant -PRON- become very crafty an excess of prudence promptly congeal -PRON- natural impulse 
in an actual spasm of caution -PRON- scarcely trust -PRON- to speak terrify lest -PRON- should commit -PRON- to something 
-PRON- glance about apprehensively pray that magnus may join -PRON- speedily relieve the tension come to see about give a dance in -PRON- new barn -PRON- answer scowl into the depth of -PRON- hat as though read from note -PRON- have conceal there want to ask how i should send out the invite 
i think of just put an ad in the mercury but as -PRON- speak presley have come up behind annixter in time to get the drift of the conversation and now observe nonsense buck not give a public ball 
-PRON- send out invitation 
hello presley -PRON- there exclaim annixter turn round 
the two shake hand 
send out invitation repeat annixter uneasily 
why must because that s the only way to do 
-PRON- be be -PRON- answer annixter perplex and troubled 
no other man of -PRON- acquaintance could have so contradict annixter without provoke a quarrel upon the instant 
why the young rancher irascible obstinate belligerent should invariably defer to the poet be an inconsistency never to be explain 
-PRON- be with great surprise that mrs derrick hear -PRON- continue well i suppose -PRON- know what -PRON- be talk about pre 
must have write invite hey 
of course 
typewritten 
why what an ass -PRON- be buck observe presley calmly 
before -PRON- get through with -PRON- -PRON- will probably insult threefourth of the people -PRON- intend to invite and have about a hundred quarrel on -PRON- hand and a lawsuit or two 
however before annixter could reply magnus come out on the porch erect grave freshly shave 
without realise what -PRON- be do annixter instinctively rise to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- be as though magnus be a of an unseen army and -PRON- a subaltern 
there be some little conversation as to the propose dance and then annixter find an excuse for draw the governor aside 
mrs derrick watch the two with eye full of poignant anxiety as -PRON- slowly pace the length of the gravel driveway to the road gate and stand there lean upon -PRON- talk earnestly magnus tall thinlippe impassive one hand in the breast of -PRON- frock coat -PRON- head bare -PRON- keen blue eye fix upon face 
annixter come at once to the main point get a wire from osterman this morning governor and get disbrow 
that mean that the denver pueblo and mojave be back of -PRON- half the fight win first off 
osterman bribe -PRON- i suppose observed magnus 
annixter raise a shoulder vexatiously get to pay for what -PRON- get -PRON- return 
-PRON- donot get something for nothing i guess 
governor -PRON- go on donot see how -PRON- can stay out of this business much longer 
-PRON- see how -PRON- will be go to win and i donot see how -PRON- can feel that -PRON- right of -PRON- to let -PRON- do all the work and stand all the expense never be a movement of any importance that go on around -PRON- that -PRON- werenot the leader in -PRON- 
all tulare county all the san joaquin for that matter know -PRON- 
-PRON- want a leader and -PRON- be look to -PRON- 
i know how -PRON- feel about politic nowadays 
but governor standard have change since -PRON- time everybody play the game now as -PRON- be play most honourable man 
-PRON- canot play -PRON- any other way and pshaw if the right win out in the end that s the main thing 
-PRON- want -PRON- in this thing and -PRON- want -PRON- bad be chew on this affair now a long time 
have -PRON- make up -PRON- mind 
do -PRON- come in 
i tell -PRON- what -PRON- have get to look at these thing in a large way get to judge by result 
well now what do -PRON- think 
do -PRON- come in glance left face and for an instant seek the ground 
-PRON- frown lower but now -PRON- be in perplexity rather than in anger 
-PRON- mind be trouble harass with a thousand dissension 
but one of strong instinct one of -PRON- keen desire be to be if only for a short time the master 
to control man have ever be -PRON- ambition submission of any kind -PRON- great horror 
-PRON- energy stir within -PRON- goad by the lash of -PRON- anger -PRON- sense of indignity of insult 
oh for one moment to be able to strike back to crush -PRON- enemy to defeat the railroad hold the corporation in the grip of -PRON- fist put down behrman rehabilitate -PRON- regain -PRON- selfrespect 
to be once more powerful to command to dominate 
-PRON- thin lip press -PRON- together the nostril of -PRON- prominent hawklike nose dilate -PRON- erect command figure stiffen unconsciously 
for a moment -PRON- see -PRON- control the situation the foremost figure in -PRON- state fear respected thousand of man beneath -PRON- -PRON- ambition at length gratify -PRON- career once apparently bring to naught complete success a palpable achievement 
what if this be -PRON- chance after all come at last after all these year 
-PRON- chance 
the instinct of the oldtime gambler the most redoubtable poker player of el dorado county stir at the word 
chance 
to know -PRON- when -PRON- come to recognise -PRON- as -PRON- pass fleet as a windflurry grip at -PRON- catch at -PRON- blind reckless stake all upon the hazard of the issue that be genius 
be this -PRON- chance 
all of a sudden -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- be 
but -PRON- honour 
-PRON- cherish lifelong integrity the unstained purity of -PRON- principle 
at this late date be -PRON- to be sacrifice 
could -PRON- now go counter to all the firm build fabric of -PRON- character 
how afterward could -PRON- bear to look harran and lyman in the face 
and yetand swing the neglect -PRON- chance mean failure a life begin in promise and end in obscurity perhaps in financial ruin poverty even 
to seize -PRON- mean achievement fame influence prestige possibly great wealth be so sorry to interrupt say mrs derrick as -PRON- come up hope mr annixter will excuse -PRON- but i want magnus to open the safe for -PRON- 
i have lose the combination and i must have some money 
phelps be go into town and i want -PRON- to pay some bill for -PRON- -PRON- come right away magnus 
phelps be ready and wait 
annixter strike -PRON- heel into the ground with a suppress oath 
always these fool feemale woman come between -PRON- and -PRON- plan mix -PRON- up in -PRON- affair 
magnus have be on the very point of say something perhaps commit -PRON- to some course of action and at precisely the wrong moment -PRON- wife have cut in 
the opportunity be lose 
the three return toward the ranch house but before say goodbye annixter have secure from magnus a promise to the effect that before come to a definite decision in the matter under discussion -PRON- would talk further with -PRON- 
presley meet -PRON- at the porch 
-PRON- be go into town with phelps and propose to annixter that -PRON- should accompany -PRON- want to go over and see old broderson annixter object 
but presley inform -PRON- that broderson have go to bonneville earlier in the morning 
-PRON- have see -PRON- go past in -PRON- buckboard 
the three man set off phelp and annixter on horseback presley on -PRON- bicycle 
when -PRON- have go mrs derrick seek out -PRON- husband in the office of the ranch house 
-PRON- be at -PRON- prettiest that morne -PRON- cheek flush with excitement -PRON- innocent wideopen eye almost girlish 
-PRON- have fasten -PRON- hair still moist with a black ribbon tie at the back of -PRON- head and the soft mass of light brown reach to below -PRON- waist make -PRON- look very young 
what be -PRON- -PRON- be say to -PRON- just now -PRON- exclaim as -PRON- come through the gate in the greenpainted wire rail of the office 
what be mr annixter say 
i know 
-PRON- be try to get -PRON- to join -PRON- try to persuade -PRON- to be dishonest wasnot that -PRON- 
tell -PRON- magnus wasnot that -PRON- 
magnus nod 
-PRON- wife draw close to -PRON- put a hand on -PRON- shoulder 
but -PRON- wonot will -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot listen to -PRON- again -PRON- wonot so much as allow even suppose -PRON- would lend -PRON- to bribery 
oh magnus i donot know what have come over -PRON- these last few week 
why before this -PRON- would have be insult if any one think -PRON- would even consider anything like dishonesty 
magnus -PRON- would break -PRON- heart if -PRON- join mr annixter and mr osterman 
why -PRON- couldnot be the same man to -PRON- afterward -PRON- who have keep -PRON- so clean till now 
and the boy what would lyman say and harran and every one who know -PRON- and respect -PRON- if -PRON- lower -PRON- to be just a political adventurer 
for a moment derrick lean -PRON- head upon -PRON- hand avoid -PRON- gaze 
at length -PRON- say draw a deep breath be trouble annie 
these be the evil day 
i have much upon -PRON- mind 
evil day or not -PRON- insist promise -PRON- this one thing that -PRON- will not join mr scheme 
-PRON- have take -PRON- hand in both of -PRON- and be look into -PRON- face -PRON- pretty eye full of plead 
promise -PRON- -PRON- repeat give -PRON- -PRON- word 
whatever happen let -PRON- always be able to be proud of -PRON- as i always have be 
give -PRON- -PRON- word 
i know -PRON- never seriously think of join mr annixter but i be so nervous and frightened sometimes 
just to relieve -PRON- mind magnus give -PRON- -PRON- word be right -PRON- answer 
no i never think seriously of -PRON- 
only for a moment i be ambitious to donot know i have hope to be oncewell that be over now 
annie -PRON- husband be a disappointed man 
give -PRON- -PRON- word -PRON- insist 
-PRON- can talk about other thing afterward 
again magnus waver about to yield to -PRON- well instinct and to the entreaty of -PRON- wife 
-PRON- begin to see how perilously far -PRON- have go in this business 
-PRON- be drift closer to -PRON- every hour 
already -PRON- be entangle already -PRON- foot be catch in the mesh that be be spin 
sharply -PRON- recoil 
again all -PRON- instinct of honesty revolted 
no whatever happen -PRON- would preserve -PRON- integrity 
-PRON- wife be right 
always -PRON- have influence -PRON- well side 
at that moment repugnance of the propose political campaign be at -PRON- pitch of intensity 
-PRON- wonder how -PRON- have ever allow -PRON- to so much as entertain the idea of join with the other 
now -PRON- would wrench free would in a single instant of power clear -PRON- of all compromise relation 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- wife 
upon -PRON- lip tremble the promise -PRON- implore 
but suddenly there come to -PRON- mind the recollection of -PRON- newmade pledge to annixter 
-PRON- have give -PRON- word that before arrive at a decision -PRON- would have a last interview with -PRON- 
to magnus -PRON- give word be sacred 
though now -PRON- want to -PRON- could not as yet draw back could not promise -PRON- wife that -PRON- would decide to do right 
the matter must be delay a few day longer 
lamely -PRON- explain this to -PRON- 
annie derrick make but little response when -PRON- have do 
-PRON- kiss -PRON- forehead and go out of the room uneasy depress -PRON- mind throng with vague fear leave magnus before -PRON- office desk -PRON- head in -PRON- hand thoughtful gloomy assault by foreboding 
meanwhile annixter phelp and presley continue on -PRON- way toward bonneville 
in a short time -PRON- have turn into the county road by the great wateringtank and proceed onward in the shade of the interminable line of poplar tree the windbreak that stretch along the roadside border the broderson ranch 
but as -PRON- draw near to saloon and grocery about half a mile outside of bonneville -PRON- recognise horse tie to the railing in front of -PRON- 
annixter leave the other and go in to see harran 
harran -PRON- say when the two have sit down on either side of one of the small table get to make up -PRON- mind one way or another pretty soon 
what be -PRON- go to do 
be -PRON- go to stand by and see the rest of the committee spend money by the bucketful in this thing and keep -PRON- hand in -PRON- pocket 
if -PRON- win -PRON- will benefit just as much as the rest of -PRON- 
i suppose -PRON- have get some money of -PRON- have havenot -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- father manager arenot -PRON- 
disconcert at directness harran stammer an affirmative add hard to know just what to do a mean position for -PRON- buck 
i want to help -PRON- other but i do want to play fair 
i donot know how to play any other way 
i should like to have a line from the governor as to how to act but there s no get a word out of -PRON- these day 
-PRON- seem to want to let -PRON- decide for -PRON- 
well look here put in annixter 
suppose -PRON- keep out of the thing till -PRON- all over and then share and share alike with the committee on campaign expense 
harran fall thoughtful -PRON- hand in -PRON- pocket frowning moodily at the toe of -PRON- boot

i say two per cent 
why lord love -PRON- -PRON- will pay a good deal more than that get to cost more than i figure to start the thing so perhaps i may have to borrow somewhere but then on such a sure game as i do want to make something out of that little tad of mine 
through here inquire annixter make ready to move off

there be a long delay while the clerk consult the tariff schedule and annixter fret impatiently 
dyke grow uneasy lean heavily on -PRON- elbow watch the clerk anxiously 
if the tariff be exorbitant -PRON- see -PRON- plan bring to naught -PRON- money jeopardise the little tad sidney deprive of -PRON- education 
-PRON- begin to blame -PRON- that -PRON- have not long before determine definitely what the railroad would charge for move -PRON- hop

-PRON- turn away with a great sigh of relief

two cent be all right though 
seem fair to -PRON- 
that fiddle of -PRON- be all put on 
i know -PRON- these railroad heeler 
-PRON- know i be a discharge employee first off and -PRON- play the game just to make -PRON- seem small because i have to ask favour of -PRON- 
i donot suppose the general office tip -PRON- slavee off to act like swine but there s the feeling through the whole herd of -PRON- 
ye get to come to -PRON- 
-PRON- let ye live only so long as -PRON- choose and what be ye go to do about -PRON- 
if ye donot like -PRON- git out annixter and the engineer descend to the street and have a drink at the yosemite bar and annixter go into the general store while dyke buy a little pair of red slipper for sidney 
before the salesman have wrap -PRON- up dyke slip a dime into the toe of each with a wink at annixter 
let the little tad find -PRON- there -PRON- say behind -PRON- hand in a hoarse whisper be one on sid 
where to now demand annixter as -PRON- regain the street go down to the post office and then pull out for the ranch 
go -PRON- way 
dyke hesitate in some confusion tugging at the end of -PRON- fine blonde beard

i guess leave -PRON- here other thing to do up the street 
so long 
the two separated and annixter hurry through the crowd to the post office but the mail that have come in on that morning train be unusually heavy 
-PRON- be nearly half an hour before -PRON- be distribute 
naturally enough annixter place all the blame of the delay upon the railroad and deliver -PRON- of some pointed remark in the midst of the wait crowd 
-PRON- be irritated to the last degree when -PRON- finally emerge upon the sidewalk again cram -PRON- mail into -PRON- pocket 
one cause of -PRON- bad temper be the fact that in the bundle of quien sabe letter be one to hilma tree in a man handwriting 
huh 
annixter have growl to -PRON- that pip delaney 
seem now that to act as gobetween for -PRON- 
well maybe that feemale girl get this letter and then again maybe -PRON- donot 
but suddenly -PRON- attention be divert 
directly opposite the post office upon the corner of the street stand quite the good business building of which bonneville could boast 
-PRON- be build of colusa granite very solid ornate imposing 
upon the heavy plate of the window of -PRON- main floor in gold and red letter one read the word loan and saving bank of tulare county 
-PRON- be of this bank that behrman be president 
at the street entrance of the building be a curve sign of polished brass fix upon the angle of the masonry this sign bear the name behrman and under -PRON- in small letter be the word real estate mortgage 
as glance fall upon this building -PRON- be surprised to see dyke stand upon the curb in front of -PRON- apparently read from a newspaper that -PRON- hold in -PRON- hand 
but annixter promptly discover that -PRON- be not read at all 
from time to time the former engineer shoot a swift glance out of the corner of -PRON- eye up and down the street 
annixter jump at a conclusion 
an idea suddenly occur to -PRON- 
dyke be watch to see if -PRON- be wait an opportunity when no one who know -PRON- should be in sight 
annixter step back a little get a telegraph pole somewhat between -PRON- and the other 
very interested -PRON- watch what be go on 
pretty soon dyke thrust the paper into -PRON- pocket and saunter slowly to the window of a stationery store next the street entrance of office 
for a few second -PRON- stand there -PRON- back turn seemingly absorb in the display but eye the street narrowly nevertheless then -PRON- turn around give a last look about and step swiftly into the doorway by the great brass sign 
-PRON- disappear 
annixter come from behind the telegraph pole with a flush of actual shame upon -PRON- face 
there have be something so slink so mean in the movement and manner of this great burly honest fellow of an engineer that -PRON- could not help but feel ashamed for -PRON- 
circumstance be such that a simple business transaction be to dyke almost culpable a degradation a thing to be conceal 
borrow money of behrman comment annixter mortgage -PRON- little homestead to the railroad put -PRON- neck in the halter 
poor fool

the two peacock magnificent proud coldhearted resent all familiarity -PRON- serve with the timorous apologetic affection of a queen ladyinwaite resign to -PRON- disdain happy if only -PRON- condescend to enjoy the grain -PRON- spread for -PRON- 
at the long trestle annixter and the priest leave the road and take the trail that cross broderson creek by the clump of greygreen willow and lead across quien sabe to the ranch house and to the mission farther on 
-PRON- be oblige to proceed in single file here and annixter who have allow the priest to go in front promptly take notice of the wicker basket -PRON- carry

speechless with chagrin the priest bundle the cock into the basket and catch up the valise take -PRON- abruptly away almost run till -PRON- have put -PRON- out of hearing of raillery 
and even ten minute later when annixter still chuckle stand upon the porch step -PRON- see the priest far in the distance climb the slope of the high ground in the direction of the mission still hurry on at a great pace -PRON- cassock flap behind -PRON- -PRON- head bent to notion the very picture of discomfiture and confusion

let -PRON- go i donot care and the sooner the well 
-PRON- countermand the supper and go to bed before -PRON- be dark light -PRON- lamp on the chair near the head of the bed and open -PRON- copperfield at the place mark by the strip of paper tear from the bag of prune 
for upward of an hour -PRON- read the novel methodically swallow one prune every time -PRON- reach the bottom of a page 
about nine oclock -PRON- blow out the lamp and punch up -PRON- pillow settle -PRON- for the night 
then as -PRON- mind relax in that strange hypnotic condition that come just before sleep a series of picture of the day doing pass before -PRON- imagination like the roll of a kinetoscope 
first -PRON- be hilma tree as -PRON- have see -PRON- in the dairyhousecharme delicious radiant of youth -PRON- thick white neck with -PRON- pale amber shadow under the chin -PRON- wide open eye rim with fine black lash the deep swell of -PRON- breast and hip the delicate lustrous floss on -PRON- cheek impalpable as the pollen of a flower 
-PRON- see -PRON- stand there in the scintillate light of the morning -PRON- smooth arm wet with milk redolent and fragrant of milk -PRON- whole desirable figure move in the golden glory of the sun steep in a lambent flame saturate with -PRON- glow with -PRON- joyous as the dawn -PRON- 
then -PRON- be los muertos and hooven the sordid little dutchman grime with the soil -PRON- work in yet vividly remember a period of military glory excite -PRON- with recollection of gravelotte and the kaiser but content now in the country of -PRON- adoption define the fatherland as the place where wife and child live 
then come the ranch house of los muerto under the grove of cypress and eucalyptus with -PRON- smooth gravel driveway and wellgroome lawn mrs derrick with -PRON- wideopene eye that so easily take on a look of uneasiness of innocence of anxious inquiry -PRON- face still pretty -PRON- brown hair that still retain so much of -PRON- brightness spread over -PRON- chair back dry in the sun magnus erect as an officer of cavalry smoothshaven grey thinlippe impose with -PRON- hawklike nose and forwardcurle grey hair presley with -PRON- dark face delicate mouth and sensitive loose lip in corduroy and lace boot smoke interesting figure suggestive of a mixed origin morbid excitable melancholy brood upon thing that have no name 
then -PRON- be bonneville with the gayety and confusion of main street the whir electric car the zincsheathed telegraph pole the buckboard with squash stow under the seat ruggle in frock coat stetson hat and shoestre necktie write abstractedly upon -PRON- blot pad dyke the engineer bigbone 
powerful deepvoiced goodnature with -PRON- fine blonde beard and massive arm rehearse the praise of -PRON- little daughter sidney guide only by the one ambition that -PRON- should be educate at a seminary slip a dime into the toe of -PRON- diminutive slipper then later overwhelmed with shame slinking into office to mortgage -PRON- homestead to the heeler of the corporation that have discharge -PRON- 
by suggestion annixter see behrman too fat with a vast stomach the check and neck meeting to form a great tremulous jowl the roll of fat over -PRON- collar sprinkle with sparse stiff hair see -PRON- brown roundtoppe hat of varnish straw the linen vest stamp with innumerable interlock horseshoe the heavy watch chain clink against the pearl vest button invariably placid unruffle never lose -PRON- temper serene unassailable enthroned 
then at the end of all -PRON- be the ranch again see in a last brief glance before -PRON- have go to bed the fecundated earth calm at last nurse the emplanted germ of life ruddy with the sunset the horizon purple the small clamour of the day lapse into quiet the great still twilight build -PRON- domelike toward the zenith 
the barn fowl be roost in the tree near the stable the horse crunch -PRON- fodder in the stall the day work ceasing by slow degree and the priest the spanish churchman father sarria relic of a depart regime kindly benign believe in all goodness a lover of -PRON- fellow and of dumb animal yet for all that hurry away in confusion and discomfiture carry in one hand the vessel of the holy communion and in the other a basket of game cock 
-PRON- be high noon and the ray of the sun that hang poise directly overhead in an intolerable white glory fall straight as plummet upon the roof and street of guadalajara 
the adobe wall and sparse brick sidewalk of the drowsing town radiate the heat in an oily quiver shimmer 
the leave of the eucalyptus tree around the plaza droop motionless limp and relaxed under the scorch searching blaze 
the shadow of these tree have shrink to -PRON- small circumference contracting close about the trunk 
the shade have dwindle to the breadth of a mere line 
the sun be everywhere 
the heat exhale from brick and plaster and metal meet the heat that steadily descend blanketwise and smother from the pale scorch sky 
only the live in chink of the crumble adobe and in interstice of the without motionless as if stuff -PRON- eye close to mere slit bask stupefy with heat 
at long interval the prolonged drone of an insect develop out of the silence vibrate a moment in a soothe somnolent long note then trail slowly into the quiet again 
somewhere in the interior of one of the dobe house a guitar snore and hum sleepily 
on the roof of the hotel a group of pigeon coo incessantly with subdued liquid murmur very plaintive a cat perfectly white with a pink nose and thin pink lip doze complacently on a fence rail full in the sun 
in a corner of the plaza three hen wallow in the bake hot dust -PRON- wing flutter cluck comfortably 
and this be all 
a sunday repose prevail the whole moribund town peaceful profound 
a certain pleasing numbness a sense of grateful enervation exhale from the scorch plaster 
there be no movement no sound of human business 
the faint hum of the insect the intermittent murmur of the guitar the mellow complaining of the pigeon the prolonged purr of the white cat the contented clucking of the these noise mingle together to form a faint drowsy bourdon prolong stupefy suggestive of an infinite quiet of a calm complacent life century old lapse gradually to -PRON- end under the gorgeous loneliness of a cloudless pale blue sky and the steady fire of an interminable sun 
in spanishmexican restaurant vanamee and presley sit opposite each other at one of the table near the door a bottle of white wine tortilla and an earthen pot of frijol between -PRON- 
-PRON- be the sole occupant of the place 
-PRON- be the day that annixter have choose for -PRON- barndance and in consequence quien sabe be in fete and work suspend 
presley and vanamee have arrange to spend the day in each other company lunch at and take a long tramp in the afternoon 
for the moment -PRON- sit back in -PRON- chair -PRON- meal all but finish 
solotari bring black coffee and a small carafe of mescal and retire to a corner of the room go to sleep 
all through the meal presley have be wonder over a certain change -PRON- observe in -PRON- friend 
-PRON- look at -PRON- again lean spare face be of an olive pallor 
-PRON- long black hair such as one see in the saint and evangelist of the artist hang over -PRON- ear 
presley again remark -PRON- pointed beard black and fine grow from the hollow cheek 
-PRON- look at -PRON- face a face like that of a young seer like a halfinspire shepherd of the hebraic legend a dweller in the wilderness gift with strange power 
-PRON- be dress as when presley have first meet -PRON- herd -PRON- sheep in brown canvas overall thrust into top boot grey flannel shirt open at the throat show the breast ruddy with tan the waist encircle with a cartridge belt empty of cartridge 
but now as presley take more careful note of -PRON- -PRON- be surprised to observe a certain new look in deepset eye 
-PRON- remember now that all through the morning vanamee have be singularly reserve 
-PRON- be continually drift into reverie abstract distrait 
indubitably something of moment have happen 
at length vanamee speak 
lean back in -PRON- chair -PRON- thumb in -PRON- belt -PRON- bearded chin upon -PRON- breast -PRON- voice be the even monotone of one speak in -PRON- sleep 
-PRON- tell presley in a few word what have happen during the first night -PRON- have spend in the garden of the old mission of the answer halffancie halfreal that have come to -PRON- 
to no other person but -PRON- would i speak of this -PRON- say but -PRON- i think will be sympathetic at least and i feel the need of unburden -PRON- of -PRON- to some one 
at first i would not trust -PRON- own sense 
i be sure i have deceive -PRON- but on a second night -PRON- happen again 
then i be no not afraid but disturbedoh shake to -PRON- very heart core 
i resolve to go no further in the matter never again to put -PRON- to test 
for a long time i stay away from the mission occupy -PRON- with -PRON- work keep -PRON- out of -PRON- mind 
but the temptation be too strong 
one night i find -PRON- there again under the black shadow of the pear tree call for angele summon -PRON- from out the dark from out the night 
this time the answer be prompt unmistakable 
i can not explain to -PRON- what -PRON- be nor how -PRON- come to -PRON- for there be no sound 
i see absolutely nothing but the empty night 
there be no moon 
but somewhere off there over the little valley far off the darkness be troubled that that go out upon -PRON- from the mission garden out over the valley call for -PRON- search for -PRON- find i donot know what but find a rest companion 
three time since then i have go to the mission garden at night 
last night be the third time 
-PRON- pause -PRON- eye shine with excitement 
presley lean forward toward -PRON- motionless with intense absorption last night -PRON- prompt 
vanamee stir in -PRON- seat -PRON- glance fall -PRON- drum an instant upon the table 
last night -PRON- answer there be a change 
the answer be -PRON- draw a deep breathnearer 
-PRON- be sure 
the other smile with absolute certainty 
-PRON- be not that i find the answer sooner easy 
i could not be mistake 
no that which have trouble the darkness that which have enter into the empty come nearer to nearer actually nearer 
-PRON- voice sink again 
-PRON- face like the face of young prophet the seer take on a halfinspire expression 
-PRON- look vaguely before -PRON- with unseeing eye 
suppose -PRON- murmur suppose i stand there under the pear tree at night and call -PRON- again and again and each time the answer come nearer and nearer and i wait until at last one night the supreme night of all sheshe suddenly the tension break 
with a sharp cry and a violent uncertain gesture of the hand vanamee come to -PRON- 
oh -PRON- exclaim what be -PRON- 
do i dare 
what do -PRON- mean 
there be time when -PRON- appal -PRON- and there be time when -PRON- thrill -PRON- with a sweetness and a happiness that i have not know since -PRON- die 
the vagueness of -PRON- 
how can i explain -PRON- to -PRON- this that happen when i call to -PRON- across the faint faroff unseen tremble in the darkness that intangible scarcely perceptible stir 
something neither hear nor see appeal to a sixth sense only 
listen -PRON- be something like this on quien sabe all last week -PRON- have be seed the earth 
the grain be there now under the earth bury in the dark in the black stillness under the clod 
can -PRON- imagine the very first little quiver of life that the grain of wheat must feel after -PRON- be sow when -PRON- answer to the call of the sun down there in the dark of the earth blind deaf the very first stir from the inert long long before any physical change have before the microscope could discover the slight the shell first tighten with the first faint premonition of life 
well -PRON- be something as illusive as that 
-PRON- pause again dream lose in a reverie then just above a whisper murmur which thou sowest be not quicken except -PRON- die and -PRON- angele die 
-PRON- could not have be mistake say presley 
-PRON- be sure that there be something 
imagination can do so much and the influence of the surrounding be strong 
how impossible -PRON- would be that anything happen 
and -PRON- say -PRON- hear nothing see nothing believe answer vanamee in a sixth sense or rather a whole system of other unnamed sense beyond the reach of -PRON- understanding 
people who live much alone and close to nature experience the sensation of -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- be something fundamental that -PRON- share with plant and animal 
the same thing that send the bird south long before the first cold the same thing that make the grain of wheat struggle up to meet the sun 
and this sense never deceive 
-PRON- may see wrong hear wrong but once touch this sixth sense and -PRON- act with absolute fidelity -PRON- be certain 
no i hear nothing in the mission garden 
i see nothing nothing touch -PRON- but i be for all that 
presley hesitate for a moment then -PRON- ask shall -PRON- go back to the garden again 
make the test again donot know 
strange enough commented presley wondering 
vanamee sink back in -PRON- chair -PRON- eye grow vacant again strange enough -PRON- murmur 
there be a long silence 
neither speak nor move 
there in that moribund ancient town wrap in -PRON- siesta flagellate with heat desert ignore bake in a noonday silence these two strange man the one a poet by nature the other by train both out of tune with -PRON- world dreamer introspective morbid lose and unfamiliar at that time search for a sign grope and baffle amidst the perplexing obscurity of the delusion sit over empty wine glass silent with the pervade silence that surround -PRON- hear only the cooing of dove and the drone of bee the quiet so profound that at length -PRON- could plainly distinguish at interval the puffing and coughing of a locomotive switching car in the station yard of bonneville 
-PRON- be no doubt this jar sound that at length rouse presley from -PRON- lethargy 
the two friend rise solotari very sleepily come forward -PRON- pay for the luncheon and step out into the heat and glare of the street of the town pass on through -PRON- and take the road that lead northward across a corner of hop field 
-PRON- be bind for the hill in the northeastern corner of quien sabe 
-PRON- be the same walk which presley have take on the previous occasion when -PRON- have first meet vanamee herd the sheep 
this encompass detour around the whole countryside be a favorite pastime of -PRON- and -PRON- be anxious that vanamee should share -PRON- pleasure in -PRON- 
but soon after leave guadalajara -PRON- find -PRON- upon the land that dyke have buy and upon which -PRON- be to raise -PRON- famous crop of hop house be close at hand a very pleasant little cottage paint white with green blind and deep porch while near -PRON- and yet in process of construction be two great storehouse and a dry and cure house where the hop be to be store and treat

as the twig be bend the tree be incline truth crush to earth will rise again as for -PRON- give -PRON- liberty or give -PRON- death and last of all a strange intrusion amongst the mild wellworn phrase two legend 
-PRON- control of public franchise and the and be an enemy of the state see comment presley -PRON- mean the little tad to understand the situation early tell -PRON- -PRON- be foolish to give that to sid to copy say mrs dyke with indulgent remonstrance 
what can -PRON- understand of public franchise 
never mind observe dyke remember -PRON- when -PRON- grow up and when the seminary people have rub -PRON- up a bit and then shell begin to ask question and understand

-PRON- say the other little girl at school and the boy too be all the same way 
oh dear -PRON- sigh why will the general office be so unkind and unjust 
why i couldnot be happy with all the money in the world if i think that even one little child hate -PRON- so that -PRON- would spit and hiss at -PRON- 
and -PRON- not one child -PRON- all of -PRON- so sidney say and think of all the grown people who hate the road woman and man the whole county the whole state thousand and thousand of people the manager and the director of the road ever think of that -PRON- ever think of all the hate that surround -PRON- everywhere everywhere and the good people that just grit -PRON- tooth when the name of the road be mention

-PRON- come with the suddenness of an explosion 
there be a commotion by the doorway a rolling burst of oath a furious stamping of hoof a wild scramble of the dancer to either side of the room and there -PRON- be

once well inside delaney haul up on the cruel spadebit at the same time drive home the spur and the buckskin without halt in -PRON- gait rise into the air upon -PRON- hind foot and come down again with a thunder of iron hoof upon the hollow floor lash out with both heel simultaneously -PRON- back arch -PRON- head between -PRON- knee

delaney have array -PRON- with painful elaboration determine to look the part bend upon create the impression resolve that -PRON- appearance at least should justify -PRON- reputation of be bad 
nothing be the campaign hat with upturned brim nor the dotted blue handkerchief knot behind the neck nor the heavy gauntlet stitch with red above bearskin chaparejo the hair trouser of the mountain cowboy the pistol holster low on the thigh 
but for the moment this holster be empty and in -PRON- right hand the hammer at full cock the chamber load the puncher flourish -PRON- teaser an army the lamplight dully reflect in the dark blue steel 
in a second of time the dance be a bedlam 
the musician stop with a discord and the middle of the crowded floor bare -PRON- instantly

after the first scramble for safety the crowd fall quiet for the fraction of an instant glue to the wall afraid to stir strike dumb and motionless with surprise and terror and in the instant silence that follow annixter -PRON- eye on delaney mutter rapidly to hilma get back get away to one side

-PRON- whip -PRON- from -PRON- pocket and fire again 
abruptly the duel begin report follow report spurt of pale blue smoke jet like the dart of short spear between the two man expand to a haze and drift overhead in waver strata

to empty -PRON- revolver and avoid be hit be the desire common to both 
-PRON- no longer vituperate each other 
the revolver speak for -PRON- 
long after annixter could recall this moment 
for year -PRON- could with but little effort reconstruct the densely pack crowd flatten against the side of the barn the festoon of lantern the mingled smell of evergreen new wood sachet and powder smoke the vague clamour of distress and terror that rise from the throng of guest the squealing of the buckskin the uneven explosion of the revolver the reverberation of trampling hoof a brief glimpse of harran excited face at the door of the harness room and in the open space in the centre of the floor -PRON- and delaney manoeuvre swiftly in a cloud of smoke revolver contain but six cartridge 
already -PRON- seem to -PRON- as if -PRON- have fire twenty time 
without doubt the next shot be -PRON- last 
then what 
-PRON- peer through the blue haze that with every discharge thicken between -PRON- and the buster 
for -PRON- own safety -PRON- must place at least one shot chest and shoulder rise suddenly above the smoke close upon -PRON- as the distraught buckskin rear again 
annixter for the first time during the fight take definite aim but before -PRON- could draw the trigger there be a great shout and -PRON- be aware of the buckskin the bridle trail the saddle empty plunging headlong across the floor crash into the line of chair 
delaney be scramble off the floor 
there be blood on the buster wrist and -PRON- no longer carry -PRON- revolver

these huddle in isolated group in corner of the garish echoing barn the woman in -PRON- wrap the young man with -PRON- coat collar turn up against the draught that once more make -PRON- feel 
for a long half hour the loud hum of eager conversation continue to issue from behind the door of the harness room 
then at length there be a prolong scraping of chair 
the session be over 
the man come out in group search for -PRON- family 
at once the homeward movement begin 
every one be wear out 
some of the rancher daughter have go to sleep against -PRON- mother shoulder 
billy the stableman and -PRON- assistant be awaken and the team be hitch up 
the stable yard be full of a maze of swinge lantern and buggy lamp 
the horse fret champ the bit the carryall creak with the straining of leather and spring as -PRON- receive -PRON- load 
at every instant one hear the rattle of wheel as vehicle after vehicle disappear in the night 
a fine drizzling rain be fall and the lamp begin to show dim in a vague haze of orange light 
magnus derrick be the last to go 
at the doorway of the barn -PRON- find annixter the roll of -PRON- have be decide -PRON- be to keep in -PRON- safe for the -PRON- arm 
silently the two shake hand 
magnus depart 
the grind of the wheel of -PRON- carryall grate sharply on the gravel of the driveway in front of the ranch house then with a hollow roll across a little plank bridge gain the roadway 
for a moment the beat of the horse hoof make -PRON- hear on the roadway 
-PRON- cease 
suddenly there be a great silence 
annixter in the doorway of the great barn stand look about -PRON- for a moment alone thoughtful 
the barn be empty 
that astonishing evening have come to an end 
the whirl of thing and people the crowd of dancer delaney the gun fight hilma tree -PRON- eye fix on -PRON- in mute confession the rabble in the harness room the news of the regrade the fierce outburst of wrath the hasty organising of the league all go spin confusedly through -PRON- recollection 
but -PRON- be exhaust 
time enough in the morning to think -PRON- all over 
by now -PRON- be rain sharply 
-PRON- put the roll of name into -PRON- inside pocket throw a sack over -PRON- head and shoulder and go down to the ranch house 
but in the harness room light by the glitter lantern and flare lamp in the midst of overturn chair spill liquor cigar stump and broken glass vanamee and presley still remain talk talk 
at length -PRON- rise and come out upon the floor of the barn and stand for a moment look about -PRON- 
billy the stableman be go the round of the wall put out light after light 
by degree the vast interior be grow dim 
upon the roof overhead the rain drum incessantly the eave drip 
the floor be litter with pine needle bit of orange peel end and fragment of torn organdie and muslin and bit of tissue paper from the phrygian bonnet and liberty cap 
the buckskin mare in the stall dozing on three leg change position with a long sigh 
the sweat stiffen the hair upon -PRON- back and loin as -PRON- dry give off a penetrating ammoniacal odour that mingle with the stale perfume of sachet and wilt flower 
presley and vanamee stand look at the desert barn 
there be a long silence 
then presley say well what do -PRON- think of -PRON- all think answer vanamee slowly think that there be a dance in brussel the night before waterloo 
i in -PRON- office at san francisco seat before a massive desk of polished redwood very ornate lyman derrick sit dictate letter to -PRON- typewriter on a certain morning early in the spring of the year 
the subdued monotone of -PRON- voice proceed evenly from sentence to sentence regular precise businesslike have the honour to acknowledge herewith -PRON- favour of the 14th instant and in reply would state please find enclose draft upon new orlean to be apply as per -PRON- understanding in answer to -PRON- favour no refer to the case of the city and county of san francisco against excelsior warehouse storage co i would say -PRON- voice continue expressionless measure distinct 
while -PRON- speak -PRON- swing slowly back and forth in -PRON- leather swivel chair -PRON- elbow rest on the arm -PRON- pop eye fix vaguely upon the calendar on the opposite wall wink at interval when -PRON- pause search for a word all for the present -PRON- say at length 
without reply the typewriter rise and withdraw thrust -PRON- pencil into the coil of -PRON- hair close the door behind -PRON- softly discreetly 
when -PRON- have go lyman rise stretch -PRON- put up three finger to hide -PRON- yawn 
to further loosen -PRON- muscle -PRON- take a couple of turn the length of -PRON- room note with satisfaction -PRON- fine appointment the pad red carpet the dull olive green tint of the wall the few choice of marshall taney field and a coloured the grand canyon of the deepseate leather chair the large and crowded bookcase top with a bust of jame lick and a huge greenish globe the waste basket of woven colour grass make by navajo indian the massive silver inkstand on the desk the elaborate filing cabinet complete in every particular and the shelf of tin box padlock impressive grave bear the name of client case and estate 
-PRON- be between thirtyone and thirtyfive year of age 
unlike harran -PRON- resemble -PRON- mother but -PRON- be much dark than annie derrick and -PRON- eye be much full the eyeball protrude give -PRON- a popeye foreign expression quite unusual and unexpected 
-PRON- hair be black and -PRON- wear a small tight pointed mustache which -PRON- be in the habit of push delicately upward from the corner of -PRON- lip with the ball of -PRON- thumb the little finger extend 
as often as -PRON- make this gesture -PRON- preface -PRON- with a little twisting gesture of the forearm in order to bring -PRON- cuff into view and in fact this movement by -PRON- be habitual 
-PRON- be dress carefully -PRON- trouser crease a pink rise in -PRON- lapel 
-PRON- shoe be of patent leather -PRON- cutaway coat be of very rough black cheviot -PRON- doublebreaste waistcoat of tan cover cloth with button of smoked pearl 
an ascot great puff of heavy black at -PRON- neck the knot transfix by a tiny golden pin set off with an opal and four small diamond 
at one end of the room be two great window of plate glass and pause at length before one of these lyman select a cigarette from -PRON- curve box of oxydize silver light -PRON- and stand look down and out willing to be idle for a moment amuse and interested in the view 
-PRON- office be on the tenth floor of the a beautiful towerlike affair of white stone that stand on the corner of market street near -PRON- intersection with kearney the most imposing office building of the city 
below -PRON- the city swarm tumultuous through -PRON- groove the cablecar start and stop with a gay jangling of bell and a strident whirring of jostle glass window 
dray and cart clatter over the cobble and an incessant shuffling of thousand of foot rise from the pavement 
around fountain the basket of the flower seller cram with chrysanthemums violet pink rose lily hyacinth set a brisk note of colour in the grey of the street 
but to notion the general impression of this centre of the citys life be not one of strenuous business activity 
-PRON- be a continuous interest in small thing a people ever willing to be amuse at trifle refuse to consider serious mattersgoodnatured allow -PRON- to be impose upon take life easilygenerous companionable enthusiastic living as -PRON- be from day to day in a place where the luxury of life be have without effort in a city that offer to consideration the restlessness of a new york without -PRON- earnestness the serenity of a naple without -PRON- languor the romance of a seville without -PRON- picturesqueness 
as lyman turn from the window about to resume -PRON- work the office boy appear at the door 
the man from the lithograph company sir announce the boy 
well what do -PRON- want demand lyman add however upon the instant show -PRON- in 
a young man enter carry a great bundle which -PRON- deposit on a chair with a gasp of relief exclaim all out of breath from the standard lithograph company 
what be know reply the other 
map i guess donot want any map 
who send -PRON- 
i guess -PRON- be mistaken 
lyman tear the cover from the top of the package draw out one of a great many huge sheet of white paper fold eight time 
suddenly -PRON- utter an exclamation ah i see 
-PRON- map 
but these should not have come here 
-PRON- be to go to the regular office for distribution 
-PRON- write a new direction on the label of the package take -PRON- to that address -PRON- go on keep this one here 
the other go to that address 
if -PRON- see mr darrell tell -PRON- that mr get the derrick may not be able to get around this afternoon but to go ahead with any business just the same 
the young man depart with the package and lyman spread out the map upon the table remain for some time study -PRON- thoughtfully 
-PRON- be a commissioner official railway map of the state of california complete to march 30th of that year 
upon -PRON- the different railway of the state be accurately plot in various colour blue green yellow 
however the blue the yellow and the green be but brief tracery very short isolate unimportant 
at a little distance these could hardly be see 
the whole map be gridirone by a vast complicated network of red line mark and these centralise at san francisco and thence ramify and spread north east and south to every quarter of the state 
from cole in the topmost corner of the map to yuma in the low from reno on one side to san francisco on the other run the plexus of red a veritable system of blood circulation complicate dividing and reunite branch splitting extend throw out feeler offshoot tap root little blood sucker that shoot out from the main jugular and go twist up into some remote county lay hold upon some forget village or town involve -PRON- in one of a myriad branch coil one of a hundred tentacle draw -PRON- as -PRON- be toward that centre from which all this system spring 
the map be white and -PRON- seem as if all the colour which should have go to vivify the various county town and city mark upon -PRON- have be absorb by that huge sprawl organism with -PRON- ruddy artery converge to a central point 
-PRON- be as though the state have be suck white and colourless and against this pallid background the red artery of the monster stand out swollen with lifeblood reach out to infinity gorge to burst an excrescence a gigantic parasite fatten upon the lifeblood of an entire commonwealth 
however in an upper corner of the map appear the name of the three new commissioner jone for the first district lyman derrick for the second and jame darrell for the third 
nominate in the democratic state convention in the fall of the precede year lyman back by the coterie of san francisco boss in the pay of -PRON- father political committee of rancher have be elect together with darrell the candidate of the pueblo and mojave road and the avow candidate of the pacific and southwestern 
darrell be rabidly against the and rabidly for -PRON- 
lyman be suppose to be the conservative member of the board the rancher candidate -PRON- be true and faithful to -PRON- interest but a calm man deliberative sway by no such violent emotion as -PRON- colleague dexterity have at last succeed in entangling magnus inextricably in the new politic 
the famous league organise in the heat of passion the night of barn dance have be consolidate all through the winter month 
-PRON- executive committee of which magnus be chairman have be through manipulation merge into the old committee compose of broderson annixter and -PRON- 
promptly thereat -PRON- have resign the chairmanship of this committee thus leave magnus at -PRON- head 
precisely as osterman have plan magnus be now one of -PRON- 
the new committee accordingly have two object in view to resist the attempt grabbing of -PRON- land by the railroad and to push forward -PRON- own secret scheme of elect a board of railroad commissioner who should regulate wheat rate so as to favour the rancher of the san joaquin 
the land case be promptly take to the court and the new the price of the land at twenty and thirty dollar an acre instead of and stubbornly fight 
but delay occur the process of the law be interminable and in the interval the committee address -PRON- to the work of seat the rancher commission as the project board of commissioner come to be call 
-PRON- be harran who first suggest that -PRON- brother lyman be put forward as the candidate for this district 
at once the proposition have a great success 
lyman seem make for the place 
while ally by every tie of blood to the ranching interest -PRON- have never be identify with -PRON- 
-PRON- be citybre 
the railroad would not be oversuspicious of -PRON- 
-PRON- be a good lawyer a good business man keen clearheade farsighte have already some practical knowledge of politic have serve a term as assistant district attorney and even at the present moment occupy the position of sheriff attorney 
more than all -PRON- be the son of magnus derrick -PRON- could be rely upon could be trust implicitly to remain loyal to the rancher cause 
the campaign for railroad commissioner have be very interesting 
at the very outset committee find -PRON- involve in corrupt politic 
the primary have to be capture at all cost and by any mean and when the convention assemble -PRON- be find necessary to buy outright the vote of certain delegate 
the campaign fund raise by contribution from magnus annixter broderson and osterman be draw upon to the extent of five thousand dollar 
only the committee know of this corruption 
the league ignore way and mean suppose as a matter of course that the campaign be honorably conduct 
for a whole week after the consummation of this part of the deal magnus have keep to -PRON- house refuse to be see allege that -PRON- be ill which be not far from the truth 
the shame of the business the loathing of what -PRON- have do be to -PRON- thing unspeakable 
-PRON- could no longer look harran in the face 
-PRON- begin a course of deception with -PRON- wife 
more than once -PRON- have resolve to break with the whole affair resign -PRON- position allow the other to proceed without -PRON- 
but now -PRON- be too late 
-PRON- be pledge 
-PRON- have join the league 
-PRON- be -PRON- chief and -PRON- defection may mean -PRON- disintegration at the very time when -PRON- need all -PRON- strength to fight the land case 
more than a mere deal in bad politic be involve 
there be the land grab 
-PRON- withdrawal from an unholy cause would mean the weakening perhaps the collapse of another cause that -PRON- believe to be righteous as truth -PRON- 
-PRON- be hopelessly catch in the mesh 
wrong seem indissolubly knit into the texture of right 
-PRON- be blind dizzy overwhelmed catch in the current of event and hurry along -PRON- know not where 
-PRON- resign -PRON- 
in the end and after much ostentatious opposition on the part of the railroad heeler lyman be nominate and subsequently elect 
when this consummation be reach magnus osterman broderson and annixter stare at each other 
-PRON- wild hope have not dare to fix -PRON- upon so easy a victory as this 
-PRON- be not believable that the corporation would allow -PRON- to be fool so easily would rush openeye into the trap 
how have -PRON- happen 
osterman however throw -PRON- hat into the air with wild whoop of delight 
old broderson permit -PRON- a feeble cheer 
even magnus beam satisfaction 
the other member of the league present at the time shake hand all around and speak of open a few bottle on the strength of the occasion 
annixter alone be recalcitrant too easy -PRON- declare 
no not satisfied 
shelgrim in all this 
why donot -PRON- show -PRON- hand damn -PRON- soul 
the thing be yellow i tell -PRON- a big fish in these water somewhere 
i donot know -PRON- name and i donot know -PRON- game but -PRON- s move round off and on just out of sight 
if -PRON- think -PRON- have net -PRON- i that s all get to say 
but -PRON- be jeer down as a croaker 
there be the commission 
-PRON- couldnot get around that could -PRON- 
there be darrell and lyman derrick both pledge to the ranch 
good lord -PRON- be never satisfied be obstinate till the very last gun be fire 
why if -PRON- get drown in a river -PRON- would float upstream just to be contrary 
in the course of time the new board be seat 
for the first few month of -PRON- term -PRON- be occupy in clear up the business leave over by the old board and in the completion of the railway map 
but now the deck be clear 
-PRON- be about to address -PRON- to the consideration of a revision of the tariff for the carriage of grain between the san joaquin valley and tidewater 
both lyman and darrell be pledge to an average ten per cent cut of the grain rate throughout the entire state 
the typewriter return with the letter for lyman to sign and -PRON- put away the map and take up -PRON- morning routine of business wonder the while what would become of -PRON- practice during the time -PRON- be involve in the business of the rancher railroad commission 
but towards noon at the moment when lyman be draw off a glass of mineral water from the siphon that stand at -PRON- elbow there be an interruption 
some one rap vigorously upon the door which be immediately after open and magnus and harran come in follow by presley 
hello hello cry lyman jump up extend -PRON- hand why here a surprise 
i didnot expect -PRON- all till tonight 
come in come in and sit down 
have a glass of sizzwater governor 
the other explain that -PRON- have come up from bonneville the night before as the executive committee of the league have receive a despatch from the lawyer -PRON- have retain to fight the railroad that the judge of the court in san francisco where the test case be be try may be expect to hand down -PRON- decision the next day 
very soon after the announcement of the new grading of the rancher land the corporation have offer through behrman to lease the dispute land to the rancher at a nominal figure 
the offer have be angrily reject and the railroad have put up the land for sale at office in bonneville 
at the exorbitant price name buyer promptly buyer beyond shadow of doubt act either for the railroad or for hitherto unknown in the county man without property without money adventurer heeler 
prominent among -PRON- and bid for the railroad holding include on ranch be delaney 
the farce of deede the corporation section to these fictitious purchaser be solemnly go through with at office the railroad guarantee -PRON- possession 
the league refuse to allow the suppose buyer to come upon the land and the railroad faithful to -PRON- pledge in the matter of guarantee -PRON- dummy possession at once begin suit in ejectment in the district court in visalia the county seat 
-PRON- be the preliminary skirmish the reconnaisance in force the combatant feel each other strength willing to proceed with caution postpone the actual deathgrip for a while till each have strengthen -PRON- position and organise -PRON- force 
during the time the case be on trial at visalia behrman be much in evidence in and about the court 
the trial -PRON- after tedious preliminary be brief 
the rancher lose 
the test case be immediately carry up to the united state circuit court in san francisco 
at the moment the decision of this court be pende 
why this be news exclaim lyman in response to the announcement do not expect -PRON- to be so prompt 
i be in court only last week and there seem to be no end of business ahead 
i suppose -PRON- be very anxious 
magnus nod 
-PRON- have seat -PRON- in one of deep chair -PRON- grey tophat with -PRON- wide brim on the floor beside -PRON- 
-PRON- coat of black broadcloth that have be tightly pack in -PRON- valise be yet wrinkle and crease -PRON- trouser be strap under -PRON- high boot 
as -PRON- speak -PRON- stroke the bridge of -PRON- hawklike nose with -PRON- bent forefinger in -PRON- chair -PRON- watch -PRON- two son with secret delight 
to -PRON- eye both be perfect specimen of -PRON- class intelligent welllooke resourceful 
-PRON- be intensely proud of -PRON- 
-PRON- be never happy never more nearly jovial never more erect more military more alert and buoyant than when in the company of -PRON- two son 
-PRON- honestly believe that no finer example of young manhood exist throughout the entire nation think -PRON- should win in this court harran observe watch the bubble break in -PRON- glass 
the investigation have be much more complete than in the visalia trial 
-PRON- case this time be too good 
-PRON- have make too much talk 
the court would not dare render a decision for the railroad 
why there s the agreement in black and the circular the railroad issue 
how one get around those 
well well -PRON- shall know in a few hour now remark magnus 
oh exclaimed lyman surprise -PRON- be for this morning then 
why arenot -PRON- at the court 
-PRON- seem undignified boy answer the governor 
-PRON- shall know soon enough 
good god exclaim harran abruptly when i think of what be involve 
why lyman -PRON- -PRON- home the ranch house -PRON- nearly all los muertos practically -PRON- whole fortune and just now when there be promise of an enormous crop of wheat 
and -PRON- be not only -PRON- 
there be over half a million acre of the san joaquin involve 
in some case of the small ranch -PRON- be the confiscation of the whole of the rancher land 
if this thing go through -PRON- will absolutely beggar nearly a hundred man 
broderson wouldnot have a thousand acre to -PRON- name 
why -PRON- monstrous 
but the corporation offer to lease these land remark lyman 
be any of the rancher take up that be any of -PRON- buy outright 
buy 
at the new figure exclaim harran at twenty and thirty an acre 
why there s not one in ten that -PRON- be landpoor 
and as for land -PRON- virtually ownno there s precious few be do that thank god 
that would be acknowledge the railroad ownership right -PRON- right for good 
none of the be do -PRON- i know 
that would be the rank treachery 
-PRON- pause for a moment drink the rest of the mineral water then interrupt lyman who be about to speak to presley draw -PRON- into the conversation through politeness say matter be just romp right along to a crisis these day a make or break for the wheat grower of the state now no mistake 
here be the land case and the new grain tariff draw to a head at about the same time 
if -PRON- win -PRON- land case there s -PRON- new freight rate to be apply and then all be beer and skittle the san joaquin go wild if -PRON- pull -PRON- off and i believe -PRON- will 
how -PRON- wheat grower be exploit and trap and deceive at every turn observe magnus sadly 
the court the capitalist the railroad each of -PRON- in turn hoodwink -PRON- into some new and wonderful scheme only to betray -PRON- in the end 
well -PRON- add turn to lyman one thing at least -PRON- can depend on 
-PRON- will cut -PRON- grain rate for -PRON- eh lyman 
lyman cross -PRON- leg and settle -PRON- in -PRON- office chair have want to have a talk with -PRON- about that sir -PRON- say 
yes -PRON- will cut the average per cent cut throughout the state as -PRON- be pledge 
but i be go to warn -PRON- governor and -PRON- harran donot expect too much at first 
the man who even after twenty year training in the operation of railroad can draw an equitable smoothly work schedule of freight rate between shipping point and common point be capable of govern the united state 
what with main line and lease line and point of transfer and the law govern common carrier and the ruling of the interstate commerce commission the whole matter have become so confused that vanderbilt -PRON- couldnot straighten -PRON- out 
and how can -PRON- be expect that railroad commission who be chosenwell let be ours be for instance from out a number of man who donot know the difference between a switching charge and a differential rate be go to regulate the whole business in six month time 
cut rate yes any fool can do that any fool can write one dollar instead of two but if -PRON- cut too low by a fraction of one per cent and if the railroad can get out an injunction tie -PRON- up and show that -PRON- new rate prevent the road be operate at a profit how be -PRON- any well off 
-PRON- conscientiousness do -PRON- credit lyman say the governor respect -PRON- for -PRON- -PRON- son 
i know -PRON- will be fair to the railroad 
that be all -PRON- want 
fairness to the corporation be fairness to the farmer and -PRON- wonot expect -PRON- to readjust the whole matter out of hand 
take -PRON- time 
-PRON- can afford to wait 
and suppose the next commission be a railroad board and reverse all -PRON- figure 
the onetime mining king the most redoubtable poker player of calavera county permit -PRON- a momentary twinkle of -PRON- eye 
by then -PRON- will be too late 
-PRON- will all of -PRON- have make -PRON- fortune by then 
the remark leave presley astonish out of all measure -PRON- never could accustom -PRON- to these strange lapse in the character 
magnus be by nature a public man judicious deliberate standing firm for principle yet upon rare occasion by some such remark as this -PRON- would betray the presence of a subnature of recklessness inconsistent all at variance with -PRON- creed and tenet 
at the very bottom when all be say and do magnus remain the deep down in -PRON- heart the spirit of the adventurer yet persist 
-PRON- will all of -PRON- have make fortune by then 
that be -PRON- precisely 
after -PRON- the deluge 
for all -PRON- public spirit for all -PRON- championship of justice and truth -PRON- respect for law magnus remain the gambler willing to play for colossal stake to hazard a fortune on the chance of win a million 
-PRON- be the true california spirit that find expression through -PRON- the spirit of the west unwilling to occupy -PRON- with detail refuse to wait to be patient to achieve by legitimate plodding the miner instinct of wealth acquire in a single night prevail in spite of all 
-PRON- be in this frame of mind that magnus and the multitude of other rancher of whom -PRON- be a type farm -PRON- ranch 
-PRON- have no love for -PRON- land 
-PRON- be not attach to the soil 
-PRON- work -PRON- ranch as a quarter of a century before -PRON- have work -PRON- mine 
to husband the resource of -PRON- marvellous san joaquin -PRON- consider niggardly petty hebraic 
to get all there be out of the land to squeeze -PRON- dry to exhaust -PRON- seem -PRON- policy 
when at last the land wear out would refuse to yield -PRON- would invest -PRON- money in something else by then -PRON- would all have make fortune 
-PRON- do not care 
after -PRON- the deluge 
lyman however be obviously uneasy willing to change the subject 
-PRON- rise to -PRON- foot pull down -PRON- cuff 
by the way -PRON- observe want -PRON- three to lunch with -PRON- today at -PRON- club 
-PRON- be close by 
-PRON- can wait there for news of the court decision as well as anywhere else and i should like to show -PRON- the place 
i have just join 
at the club when the four man be seat at a small table in the round window of the main room popularity with all class be very apparent 
hardly a man enter that do not call out a salutation to -PRON- some even come over to shake -PRON- hand 
-PRON- seem to be every man friend and to all -PRON- seem equally genial 
-PRON- affability even to those whom -PRON- dislike be unfaile 
see that fellow yonder -PRON- say to magnus indicate a certain middleaged man flamboyantly dressed who wear -PRON- hair long who be afflict with sore eye and the collar of whose velvet coat be sprinkle with dandruff hartrath the artist a man absolutely devoid of even the common decency 
how -PRON- get in here be a mystery to -PRON- 
yet when this hartrath come across to say how do -PRON- do to lyman lyman be as eager in -PRON- cordiality as -PRON- warm friend could have expect 
why the devil be -PRON- so chummy with -PRON- then observe harran when hartrath have go away explanation be vague 
the truth of the matter be that old son be consume by inordinate ambition 
political preferment be -PRON- dream and to the realisation of this dream popularity be an essential 
every man who could vote blackguard or gentleman be to be conciliate if possible 
-PRON- make -PRON- -PRON- study to become know throughout the entire put influential man under obligation to -PRON- 
-PRON- never forget a name or a face 
with everybody -PRON- be the hailfellowwellmet 
-PRON- ambition be not trivial 
in -PRON- disregard for small thing -PRON- resemble -PRON- father 
municipal office have no attraction for -PRON- 
-PRON- goal be high 
-PRON- have plan -PRON- life twenty year ahead 
already attorney assistant district attorney and railroad commissioner -PRON- could if -PRON- desire attain the office of district attorney -PRON- 
just now -PRON- be a question with -PRON- whether or not -PRON- would be politic to fill this office 
would -PRON- advance or sidetrack -PRON- in the career -PRON- have outline for -PRON- 
lyman want to be something well than district attorney better than mayor than state senator or even than member of the united state congress 
-PRON- want to be in fact what -PRON- father be only in succeed where magnu have fail 
-PRON- want to be governor of the state 
-PRON- have put -PRON- tooth together and deaf to all other consideration blind to all other issue -PRON- work with the infinite slowness the unshakable tenacity of the coral insect to this one end 
after luncheon be over lyman order cigar and liqueur and with the three other return to the main room of the club 
however -PRON- former place in the round window be occupy 
a middleaged man with iron grey hair and moustache who wear a frock coat and a white waistcoat and in some indefinable manner suggest a retired naval officer be sit at -PRON- table smoke a long thin cigar 
at sight of -PRON- presley become animate 
-PRON- utter a mild exclamation why isnot that mr cedarquist 
cedarquist repeat lyman derrick know -PRON- well 
yes of course -PRON- be -PRON- continue 
governor -PRON- must know -PRON- 
-PRON- be one of -PRON- representative man 
-PRON- would enjoy talk to -PRON- 
-PRON- be the head of the big atlas iron work 
-PRON- have shut down recently -PRON- know 
not fail exactly but just cease to be a pay investment and cedarquist close -PRON- out 
-PRON- have other interest though a rich capitalist 
lyman bring the group up to the gentleman in question and introduce -PRON- 
mr magnus derrick of course observed cedarquist as -PRON- take the hand know -PRON- by repute for some time sir 
this be a great pleasure i assure -PRON-

but hartrath unwilling to face the enmity that -PRON- feel accumulate against -PRON- take -PRON- away 
a picture of study of the contra costa to be raffle in the club room for the benefit of the fair 
-PRON- -PRON- be in charge of the matter 
-PRON- disappear 
cedarquist look after -PRON- with contemplative interest 
then turn to magnus excuse -PRON- for the acridity of -PRON- word no bad than many other and the people of this state and city be after all only a little more addleheaded than other american 
-PRON- be -PRON- favourite topic 
sure of the interest of -PRON- hearer -PRON- unburden -PRON- 
if i be to name the one cry evil of american life mr derrick -PRON- continue -PRON- would be the indifference of the well people to public affair 
-PRON- be so in all -PRON- great centre 
there be other great trust god know in the united state besides -PRON- own dear and railroad 
every state have -PRON- own grievance 
if -PRON- be not a railroad trust -PRON- be a sugar trust or an oil trust or an industrial trust that exploit the people the indifference of the people be the opportunity of the despot 
-PRON- be as true as that the whole be great than the part and the maxim be so old that -PRON- be be laughable 
-PRON- be neglect and disuse for the sake of some new ingenious and complicated theory some wonderful scheme of reorganisation but the fact remain nevertheless simple fundamental everlasting 
the people have but to say no and not the strong tyranny political religious or financial that be ever organise could survive one week 
the other absorb attentive approve nod -PRON- head in silence as the manufacturer finish one reason mr derrick the other resume after a moment why i have be so glad to meet -PRON- 
-PRON- and -PRON- league be try to say no to the trust 
i hope -PRON- will succeed 
if -PRON- example will rally the people to -PRON- cause -PRON- will 
otherwise -PRON- shake -PRON- head 
one stage of the fight be to be pass this very day observe magnus 
-PRON- son and -PRON- be expect hourly news from the city hall a decision in -PRON- case be pende 
-PRON- be both of -PRON- fighter -PRON- seem mr derrick say cedarquist 
each with -PRON- particular enemy 
-PRON- be well meet indeed the farmer and the manufacturer both in the same grist between the two millstone of the lethargy of the public and the aggression of the trust the two great evil of modern america 
pre -PRON- boy there be -PRON- epic poem ready to hand 
but cedarquist be full of another idea 
rarely do so favourable an opportunity present -PRON- for explain -PRON- theory -PRON- ambition 
address -PRON- to magnus -PRON- continue fortunately for -PRON- the atlas company be not -PRON- only investment 
i have other interest 
the building of sailing be an ambition of this purpose mr derrick to carry american wheat 
for year i have study this question of american wheat and at last i have arrive at a theory 
let -PRON- explain 
at present all -PRON- california wheat go to liverpool and from that port be distribute over the world 
but a change be come 
i be sure of -PRON- 
-PRON- young man -PRON- turn to presley lyman and harran will live to see -PRON- 
-PRON- century be about do 
the great word of this nineteenth century have be production 
the great word of the twentieth century will to -PRON- -PRON- as a market for -PRON- let -PRON- take a concrete a market for -PRON- europe be play out 
population in europe be not increase fast enough to keep up with the rapidity of -PRON- production 
in some case as in france the population be stationary however have go on produce wheat at a tremendous rate 
the result be overproduction 
-PRON- supply more than europe can eat and down go the price 
the remedy be in the curtailing of -PRON- wheat area but in this -PRON- for year -PRON- have be send -PRON- wheat from east to west from california to europe 
but the time will come when -PRON- must send -PRON- from west to east 
-PRON- must march with the course of empire not against -PRON- 
i mean -PRON- must look to china 
rice in china be lose -PRON- nutritive quality 
the asiatic though must be feed if not on rice then on wheat 
why mr derrick if only onehalf the population of china eat a half ounce of flour per man per day all the wheat area in california could not feed -PRON- 
ah if i could only hammer that into the brain of every rancher of the san joaquin yes and of every owner of every bonanza farm in dakota and minnesota 
send -PRON- wheat to china handle -PRON- yourself do away with the middleman break up the chicago wheat pit and elevator ring and mix house 
when in feed china -PRON- have decrease the european shipment the effect be instantaneous 
price go up in europe without have the least effect upon the price in china 
-PRON- hold the key -PRON- have the more than -PRON- -PRON- can eat 
asia and europe must look to america to be feed 
what fatuous neglect of opportunity to continue to deluge europe with -PRON- surplus food when the east tremble upon the verge of starvation 
the two man cedarquist and magnus continue the conversation a little further 
the manufacturer idea be new to the governor 
-PRON- be greatly interested 
-PRON- withdraw from the conversation 
thoughtful -PRON- lean back in -PRON- place stroke the bridge of -PRON- beaklike nose with a crooked forefinger 
cedarquist turn to harran and begin ask detail as to the condition of the wheat grower of the san joaquin 
lyman still maintain an attitude of polite aloofness yawn occasionally behind three finger and presley be leave to the company of -PRON- own thought 
there have be a day when the affair and grievance of the farmer of -PRON- annixter osterman and old fill -PRON- only with disgust 
-PRON- mind full of a great vague epic poem of the west -PRON- have keep -PRON- apart disdainful of what -PRON- choose to consider -PRON- petty squabble 
but the scene in harness room have thrill and uplift -PRON- 
-PRON- be palpitate with excitement all through the succeed month 
-PRON- abandon the idea of an epic poem 
in six month -PRON- have not write a single verse 
day after day -PRON- tremble with excitement as the relation between the trust and league become more and more strained 
-PRON- see the matter in -PRON- true light 
-PRON- be typical 
-PRON- be the worldold war between freedom and tyranny and at time -PRON- hatred of the railroad shake -PRON- like a crisp and withered reed while the languid indifference of the people of the state to the quarrel fill -PRON- with a blind exasperation 
but as -PRON- have once explain to vanamee -PRON- must find expression 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- would suffocate otherwise 
-PRON- have begin to keep a journal 
as the inclination spur -PRON- -PRON- write down -PRON- thought and idea in this sometimes every day sometimes only three or four time a month 
also -PRON- fling aside -PRON- book of tennyson browning even address -PRON- to mill malthus young poushkin henry george schopenhauer 
-PRON- attack the subject of social inequality with unbounded enthusiasm 
-PRON- devour rather than read and emerge from the affair -PRON- mind a confused jumble of conflicting notion sick with overeffort rage against injustice and oppression and with not one sane suggestion as to remedy or redress 
the butt of -PRON- cigarette scorch -PRON- finger and rouse -PRON- from -PRON- brooding 
in the act of light another -PRON- glance across the room and be surprised to see two very prettily dressed young woman in the company of an old gentleman in a long frock coat stand before paint examine -PRON- -PRON- head upon one side 
presley utter a murmur of surprise 
-PRON- -PRON- be a member of the club and the presence of woman within -PRON- door except on special occasion be not tolerate 
-PRON- turn to lyman derrick for an explanation but this other have also see the woman and abruptly exclaim declare i have forget about -PRON-

why -PRON- be not up to date lyman

-PRON- find mean to survey harran and magnus 
certainly neither -PRON- father nor -PRON- brother be dress for the function that impend 
-PRON- have be stupid 
magnus invariably attract attention and now with -PRON- trouser strap under -PRON- boot -PRON- wrinkle frock twist -PRON- cuff into sight with an impatient nervous movement of -PRON- wrist glance a second time at -PRON- brother pink face forward curl yellow hair and clothe of a country cut

-PRON- annixter broderson and osterman would pool -PRON- issue 
-PRON- would convince -PRON- of the magnificence of the new movement 
-PRON- would be -PRON- pioneer 
harran would be send to hong kong to represent the four 
-PRON- would ship perhaps one of american build the nation flag at the peak and the sailing of that ship gorge with the crop from and ranch from quien sabe and los muerto would be like the sailing of the caravel from palo 
-PRON- would mark a new era -PRON- would make an epoch 
with this vision still expand before the eye of -PRON- mind magnus with harran at -PRON- elbow prepare to depart 
-PRON- descend to the low floor and involve -PRON- for a moment in the throng of fashionable that block the hallway and the entrance to the main room where the number of the raffle be be draw 
near the head of the stair -PRON- encounter presley and cedarquist who have just come out of the wine room 
magnus still on fire with the new idea press a few question upon the manufacturer before bid -PRON- goodbye 
-PRON- wish to talk further upon the great subject interested as to detail but cedarquist be vague in -PRON- reply 
-PRON- be no farmer -PRON- hardly know wheat when -PRON- see -PRON- only -PRON- know the trend of the world affair -PRON- feel -PRON- to be set inevitably eastward 
however -PRON- very vagueness be a further inspiration to the governor 
-PRON- sweep detail aside 
-PRON- see only the grand coup the huge result the east conquer the march of empire roll westward finally arrive at -PRON- starting point the vague mysterious orient 
-PRON- see -PRON- wheat like the crest of an advance billow cross the pacific bursting upon asia flood the orient in a golden torrent 
-PRON- be the new era 
-PRON- have live to see the death of the old and the birth of the new first the mine now the ranch first gold now wheat 
once again -PRON- become the pioneer hardy brilliant take colossal chance blaze the way grasp a million in a single day 
all the bigness of -PRON- nature leap up again within -PRON- 
at the magnitude of the inspiration -PRON- feel young again indomitable the leader at last king of -PRON- fellow wrest from fortune at this eleventh hour before -PRON- old age the place of high command which so long have be deny -PRON- 
at last -PRON- could achieve 
abruptly magnus be aware that some one have speak -PRON- name 
-PRON- look about and see behind -PRON- at a little distance two gentleman stranger to -PRON- 
-PRON- have withdraw from the crowd into a little recess 
evidently have no woman to look after -PRON- have lose interest in the afternoon affair 
magnus realise that -PRON- have not see -PRON- 
one of -PRON- be read aloud to -PRON- companion from an evening edition of that day newspaper 
-PRON- be in the course of this reading that magnu catch the sound of -PRON- name 
-PRON- pause listening and presley harran and cedarquist follow -PRON- example 
soon -PRON- all understand 
-PRON- be listen to the report of the judge decision for which magnus be decision in the case of the league vs the railroad 
for the moment the polite clamour of the raffle hush win number be be draw 
the guest hold -PRON- breath and in the ensue silence magnus and the other hear these word distinctly -PRON- follow that the title to the land in question be in the pacific and southwestern railroad and the defendant have no title and -PRON- possession be wrongful 
there must be finding and judgment for the plaintiff and -PRON- be so order 
in spite of -PRON- magnus pale 
harran shut -PRON- tooth with an oath 
-PRON- exaltation of the previous moment collapse like a pyramid of card 
the vision of the new movement of the wheat the conquest of the east the invasion of the orient seem only the flimsy mockery 
with a brusque wrench -PRON- be snatch back to reality 
between -PRON- and the vision between the fecund san joaquin reek with fruitfulness and the million of asia crowd toward the verge of starvation lie the ironhearte monster of steel and steam implacable insatiable entrail gorge with the life blood that -PRON- suck from an entire commonwealth -PRON- ever hungry maw glut with the harvest that should have feed the famished belly of the whole world of the orient 
but abruptly while the four man stand there gaze into each other face a vigorous handclapping break out 
the raffle of picture be over and as presley turn about -PRON- see mrs cedarquist and -PRON- two daughter signal eagerly to the manufacturer unable to reach -PRON- because of the intervene crowd 
then mrs cedarquist raise -PRON- voice and cry win win 
unnoticed and with but a brief word to cedarquist magnus and harran go down the marble step lead to the street door silent arm tight around -PRON- father shoulder 
at once the orchestra strike into a lively air 
a renew murmur of conversation break out and cedarquist as -PRON- say goodbye to presley look first at the retreat figure of the rancher then at the gayly dressed throng of beautiful woman and debonair young man and indicate the whole scene with a single gesture say smile sadly as -PRON- speak not a city presley not a city but a midway plaisance 
underneath the long trestle where broderson creek cut the line of the railroad and the upper road the ground be low and cover with a second growth of grey green willow 
along the border of the creek be occasional marshy spot and now and then hilma tree come here to gather watercress which -PRON- make into salad 
the place be picturesque seclude an oasis of green shade in all the limitless flat monotony of the surround wheat land 
the creek have erode deep into the little gully and no matter how hot -PRON- be on the baking shimmering level of the ranch above down here one always find one self envelop in an odorous moist coolness 
from time to time the incessant murmur of the creek pour over and around the large stone be interrupt by the thunder of train roar out upon the trestle overhead pass on with the furious gallop of -PRON- hundred of iron wheel leave in the air a taint of hot oil acrid smoke and reek of escape steam 
on a certain afternoon in the spring of the year hilma be return to quien sabe from by the trail that lead from los muertos to ranch house under the trestle 
-PRON- have spend the afternoon with minna hooven who for the time be be keep indoor because of a wrench ankle 
as hilma descend into the gravel flat and thicket of willow underneath the trestle -PRON- decide that -PRON- would gather some cress for -PRON- supper that night 
-PRON- find a spot around the base of one of the support of the trestle where the cress grow thickest and pluck a couple of handful wash -PRON- in the creek and pin -PRON- up in -PRON- handkerchief 
-PRON- make a little round cold bundle and hilma warm from -PRON- walk find a delicious enjoyment in press the damp ball of -PRON- to -PRON- cheek and neck 
for all the change that annixter have note in -PRON- upon the occasion of the barn dance hilma remain in many thing a young child 
-PRON- be never at loss for enjoyment and could always amuse -PRON- when leave alone 
just now -PRON- choose to drink from the creek lie prone on the ground -PRON- face halfburie in the water and this not because -PRON- be thirsty but because -PRON- be a new way to drink 
-PRON- imagine -PRON- a belate traveller a poor girl an outcast quench -PRON- thirst at the wayside brook -PRON- little packet of cress do duty for a bundle of clothe 
night be come on 
perhaps -PRON- would storm 
-PRON- have nowhere to go 
-PRON- would apply at a hut for shelter 
abruptly the temptation to dabble -PRON- foot in the creek present -PRON- to -PRON- 
always -PRON- have like to play in the water 
what a delight now to take off -PRON- shoe and stocking and wade out into the shallow near the bank 
-PRON- have wear low shoe that afternoon and the dust of the trail have filter in above the edge 
at time -PRON- feel the grit and grey sand on the sol of -PRON- foot and the sensation have set -PRON- tooth on edge 
what a delicious alternative the cold clean water suggest and how easy -PRON- would be to do as -PRON- please just then if only -PRON- be a little girl 
in the end -PRON- be stupid to be grow up 
sit upon the bank one finger tuck into the heel of -PRON- shoe hilma hesitate 
suppose a train should come 
-PRON- fancy -PRON- could see the engineer lean from the cab with a great grin on -PRON- face or the brakeman shouting gibe at -PRON- from the platform 
abruptly -PRON- blush scarlet 
the blood throb in -PRON- temple 
-PRON- heart beat 
since the famous evening of the barn dance annixter have speak to -PRON- but twice 
hilma no longer look after the ranch house these day 
the thought of set foot within diningroom and bedroom terrify -PRON- and in the end -PRON- mother have take over that part of -PRON- work 
of the two meeting with the master of quien sabe one have be a mere exchange of good morning as the two happen to meet over by the artesian well the other more complicated have occur in the dairyhouse again annixter pretending to look over the new cheese press ask about detail of -PRON- work 
when this have happen on that previous occasion end with attempt to kiss -PRON- hilma have be talkative enough chatter on from one subject to another never at a loss for a theme 
but this last time be a veritable ordeal 
no sooner have annixter appear than -PRON- heart leap and quiver like that of the houndharried doe 
-PRON- speech fail -PRON- 
throughout the whole brief interview -PRON- have be miserably tonguetie stammer monosyllable confuse horribly awkward and when annixter have go away -PRON- have flee to -PRON- little room and bolt the door have fling -PRON- face downward on the bed and weep as though -PRON- heart be break -PRON- do not know why 
that annixter have be overwhelm with business all through the winter be an inexpressible relief to hilma 
-PRON- affair take -PRON- away from the ranch continually 
-PRON- be absent sometimes for week make trip to san francisco or to sacramento or to bonneville 
perhaps -PRON- be forget -PRON- overlook -PRON- and while at first -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- ask nothing well the idea of -PRON- begin to occupy -PRON- mind 
-PRON- begin to wonder if -PRON- be really so 
-PRON- know -PRON- trouble 
everybody do 
the news of the sudden forward movement of the force inaugurate the campaign have flare whitehot and blaze all over the country side 
to notion attitude be heroic beyond all expression 
-PRON- courage in face the railroad as -PRON- have face delaney in the barn seem to -PRON- the pitch of sublimity 
-PRON- refuse to see any auxiliary aid -PRON- in -PRON- fight 
to -PRON- imagination the great league which all the rancher be join be a mere form 
annixter front the monster 
but for -PRON- the corporation would gobble quien sabe as a whale would a minnow 
-PRON- be a hero who stand between -PRON- all and destruction 
-PRON- be a protector of -PRON- family 
-PRON- be -PRON- champion 
-PRON- begin to mention -PRON- in -PRON- prayer every night add a further petition to the effect that -PRON- would become a good man and that -PRON- should not swear so much and that -PRON- should never meet delaney again 
however as hilma still debate the idea of bathe -PRON- foot in the creek a train do actually thunder past regular evening through express that never stop between bakersfield and fresno 
-PRON- storm by with a deafen clamour and a swirl of smoke in a long succession of waycoache and chocolate coloured pullman grimy with the dust of the great desert of the southwest 
the quivering of the trestle support set a tremble in the ground underfoot 
the thunder of wheel drown all sound of the flowing of the creek and also the noise of the buckskin mare hoof descend from the trail upon the gravel about the creek so that hilma turn about after the passage of the train see annixter close at hand with the abruptness of a vision 
-PRON- be look at -PRON- smile as -PRON- rarely do the firm line of -PRON- outthrust low lip relax goodhumouredly 
-PRON- have take off -PRON- campaign hat to -PRON- and though -PRON- stiff yellow hair be twist into a bristling mop the little persistent tuft on the crown usually defiantly erect as an scalplock be nowhere in sight 
hello -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- miss hilma -PRON- exclaim get down from the buckskin and allow -PRON- to drink 
hilma nod scramble to -PRON- foot dust -PRON- skirt with nervous pat of both hand 
annixter sit down on a great rock close by and the loop of the bridle over -PRON- arm light a cigar and begin to talk 
-PRON- complain of the heat of the day the bad condition of the low road over which -PRON- have come on -PRON- way from a committee meeting of the league at los muerto of the slowness of the work on the irrigate ditch and as a matter of course of the general hard time 
miss hilma -PRON- say abruptly never -PRON- marry a ranchman never out of trouble 
hilma gasp -PRON- eye widen till the full round of the pupil be disclose 
instantly a certain inexplicable guiltiness overpower -PRON- with incredible confusion 
-PRON- hand tremble as -PRON- press the bundle of cress into a hard ball between -PRON- palm 
annixter continue to talk 
-PRON- be disturb and excite -PRON- at this unexpected meeting 
never through all the past winter month of strenuous activity the fever of political campaign the harrowing delay and ultimate defeat in one law court after another have -PRON- forget the look in face as -PRON- stand with one arm around -PRON- on the floor of -PRON- barn in peril of -PRON- life from the buster revolver 
that dumb confession of wideopen eye have be enough for -PRON- 
yet somehow -PRON- never have have a chance to act upon -PRON- 
during the short period when -PRON- could be on -PRON- ranch hilma have always manage to avoid -PRON- 
once even -PRON- have spend a month about christmas time with -PRON- mother father who keep a hotel in san francisco 
now today however -PRON- have -PRON- all to -PRON- 
-PRON- would put an end to the situation that trouble -PRON- and vex -PRON- day after day month after month 
beyond question the moment have come for something definite -PRON- could not say precisely what 
readjust -PRON- cigar between -PRON- tooth -PRON- resume -PRON- speech 
-PRON- suit -PRON- humour to take the girl into -PRON- confidence follow an instinct which warn -PRON- that this would bring about a certain closeness of -PRON- relation a certain intimacy 
what do -PRON- think of this row anyways miss railroad fuss in general 
think shelgrim and -PRON- rusher be go to jump quien go to run -PRON- off the ranch

that same morning mother have awaken -PRON- accord to -PRON- instruction at daybreak

dyke -PRON- be a bighearted jovial man who spread an atmosphere of goodhumour wherever -PRON- go 
in the evening -PRON- play with sidney like a big boy an old brother lie on the bed or the sofa take -PRON- in -PRON- arm 
between -PRON- -PRON- have invent a great game 
the exengineer -PRON- boot remove -PRON- huge leg in the air hoist the little tad on the sol of -PRON- stockinged foot like a circus acrobat dandle -PRON- there pretend -PRON- be about to let -PRON- fall 
sidney choke with delight hold on nervously with little scream and chirps of excitement while -PRON- shift -PRON- gingerly from one foot to another and thence the final act the great gallery play to the palm of one great hand 
at this point mrs dyke be call in both father and daughter child both cry out that -PRON- be to come in and look look 
-PRON- arrive out of breath from the kitchen the potato masher in -PRON- hand 
such child -PRON- murmur shake -PRON- head at -PRON- amuse for all that tuck the potato masher under -PRON- arm and clap -PRON- hand 
in the end -PRON- be part of the game that sidney should tumble down upon dyke whereat -PRON- invariably vent a great bellow as if in pain declare that -PRON- rib be break 
gasp -PRON- eye shut -PRON- pretend to be in the extreme of -PRON- be die 
sidney always a little uncertain amuse but distressed shake -PRON- nervously tug at -PRON- beard push open -PRON- eyelid with one finger implore -PRON- not to frighten -PRON- to wake up and be good 
on this occasion while yet -PRON- be halfdressed dyke tiptoe into -PRON- mother room to look at sidney fast asleep in -PRON- little iron cot -PRON- arm under -PRON- head -PRON- lip part 
with infinite precaution -PRON- kiss -PRON- twice and then find one little stocking hung with -PRON- mate very neatly over the back of a chair drop into -PRON- a dime roll up in a wad of paper 
-PRON- wink all to -PRON- and go out again close the door with exaggerated carefulness 
-PRON- breakfast alone mrs dyke pour -PRON- coffee and hand -PRON- -PRON- plate of ham and egg and half an hour later take -PRON- off in -PRON- springless skeleton wagon hum a tune behind -PRON- beard and crack the whip over the back of -PRON- staid and solid farm horse 
the morning be fine the sun just come up 
-PRON- leave guadalajara sleep and lifeless on -PRON- left and go across lot over an angle of quien sabe come out upon the upper road a mile below the long trestle 
-PRON- be in great spirit look about -PRON- over the brown field ruddy with the dawn 
almost directly in front of -PRON- but far off the gilded dome of the courthouse at bonneville be glint radiant in the first ray of the sun while a few mile distant toward the north the venerable campanile of the mission san juan stand silhouette in purplish black against the flame east 
as -PRON- proceed the great farm horse jog forward placid deliberate the country side wake to another day 
cross the irrigating ditch further on -PRON- meet a gang of portuguese with pick and shovel over -PRON- shoulder just go to work 
hooven already abroad shout -PRON- a goot mornun from behind the fence of los muertos 
far off toward the southwest in the bare expanse of the open field where a clump of eucalyptus and cypress tree set a dark green note a thin stream of smoke rise straight into the air from the kitchen of ranch house 
but a mile or so beyond the long trestle -PRON- be surprised to see magnus protege the onetime shepherd vanamee come across quien sabe by a trail from one of division house 
without know exactly why dyke receive the impression that the young man have not be in bed all of that night 
as the two approach each other dyke eye the young fellow 
-PRON- be distrustful of vanamee have the countrybre suspicion of any person -PRON- could not understand 
vanamee be beyond doubt no part of the life of ranch and country town 
-PRON- be an alien a vagabond a strange fellow who come and go in mysterious fashion make no friend keep to -PRON- 
why do -PRON- never wear a hat why indulge in a fine black point beard when either a round beard or a mustache be the invariable custom 
why do -PRON- not cut -PRON- hair 
above all why do -PRON- prowl about so much at night 
as the two pass each other dyke for all -PRON- goodnature be a little blunt in -PRON- greeting and look back at the exshepherd over -PRON- shoulder 
dyke be right in -PRON- suspicion bed have not be disturb for three night 
on the monday of that week -PRON- have pass the entire night in the garden of the mission overlook the seed ranch in the little valley 
tuesday evening have find -PRON- mile away from that spot in a deep arroyo in the sierra foothill to the eastward while wednesday -PRON- have sleep in an abandon dobe on stock range twenty mile from -PRON- rest place of the night before 
the fact of the matter be that the old restlessness have once more seize upon vanamee 
something begin tug at -PRON- the spur of some unseen rider touch -PRON- flank 
the instinct of the wanderer woke and move 
for some time now -PRON- have be a part of the los muertos staff 
on quien sabe as on the other ranch the slack season be at hand 
while wait for the wheat to come up no one be do much of anything 
vanamee have come over to los muertos and spend most of -PRON- day on horseback ride the range round up and watch the cattle in the fourth division of the ranch 
but if the vagabond instinct now rouse -PRON- in the strange fellow nature a counter influence have also set in 
more and more vanamee frequent the mission garden after nightfall sometimes remain there till the dawn begin to whiten lying prone on the ground -PRON- chin on -PRON- fold arm -PRON- eye search the darkness over the little valley of the seed ranch watch watch 
as the day go by -PRON- become more reticent than ever 
presley often come to find -PRON- on the stock range a lonely figure in the great wilderness of bare green hillside but vanamee no longer take -PRON- into -PRON- confidence 
father sarria alone hear -PRON- strange story 
dyke drive on toward bonneville thinking over the whole matter 
-PRON- know as every one do in that part of the country the legend of vanamee and angele the romance of the mission garden the mystery of the other flight to the desert of the southw -PRON- periodic return -PRON- strange reticent solitary character but like many another of the country people -PRON- account for vanamee by a short and easy method 
no doubt the fellow wit be turn 
that be the long and short of -PRON- 
the exengineer reach the post office in bonneville towards eleven oclock but -PRON- do not at once present -PRON- notice of the arrival of -PRON- consignment at office 
-PRON- entertain -PRON- to indulge in an hour lounge about the street 
-PRON- be seldom -PRON- get into town and when -PRON- do -PRON- permit -PRON- the luxury of enjoy -PRON- evident popularity 
-PRON- meet friend everywhere in the post office in the drug store in the barber shop and around the courthouse

under the visor of -PRON- of -PRON- engineering blue eye twinkle with vast goodnature 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- make a fine figure as -PRON- go by a group of young girl in lawn and muslin and garden hat on -PRON- way to the post office 
-PRON- wonder if -PRON- look after -PRON- wonder if -PRON- have hear that -PRON- be in a fair way to become a rich man 
but the chronometer in the window of the jewelry store warn -PRON- that time be pass

the figure be that of a middleaged man fat with a great stomach which -PRON- stroke from time to time 
as -PRON- turn about address a remark to the clerk dyke recognise behrman 
the banker railroad agent and political manipulator seem to the eye to be more gross than ever

the league be clamorous ubiquitous -PRON- object know to every urchin on the street but the trust be silent -PRON- way inscrutable the public see only result 
-PRON- work on in the dark calm discipline irresistible 
abruptly dyke receive the impression of the multitudinous ramification of the colossus 
under -PRON- foot the ground seem mine down there below -PRON- in the dark the huge tentacle go silently twist and advance spread out in every direction sap the strength of all opposition quiet gradual bide the time to reach up and out and grip with a sudden unleashing of gigantic strength be want some car of -PRON- people before the summer be out observed dyke to the clerk as -PRON- fold up and put away the order that the other have hand -PRON-

yes what s -PRON- rule -PRON- basis demand dyke turn swiftly to -PRON- 
behrman emphasise each word of -PRON- reply with a tap of one forefinger on the counter before -PRON- the exengineer step back a pace -PRON- finger on the ledge of the counter to steady -PRON- 
-PRON- feel -PRON- grow pale -PRON- heart become a mere leaden weight in -PRON- chest inert refuse to beat 
in a second the whole affair in all -PRON- bearing go speed before the eye of -PRON- imagination like the rapid unrolling of a panorama 
every cent of -PRON- earning be sink in this hop business of -PRON- 
more than that -PRON- have borrow money to carry -PRON- on certain of of behrman offer -PRON- crop and -PRON- little home as security 
once -PRON- fail to meet -PRON- obligation behrman would foreclose 
not only would the railroad devour every morsel of -PRON- profit but also -PRON- would take from -PRON- -PRON- home at a blow -PRON- would be leave penniless and without a home 
what would then become of -PRON- what would become of the little tad 
-PRON- whom -PRON- have be plan to educate like a veritable lady 
for all that year -PRON- have talk of -PRON- ambition for -PRON- little daughter to every one -PRON- meet 
all bonneville know of -PRON- 
what a mark for gibe -PRON- have make of -PRON-

what a target for who have fancy -PRON- could elude the railroad 
-PRON- remember -PRON- have once say the great trust have overlook -PRON- little enterprise disdain to plunder such small fry 
-PRON- should have know well than that 
how have -PRON- ever imagine the road would permit -PRON- to make any money 
anger be not in -PRON- yet no rousing of the blind whitehot wrath that leap to the attack with prehensile finger move -PRON- 
the blow merely crush stagger confused 
-PRON- step aside to give place to a coatless man in a pink shirt who enter carry in -PRON- hand an automatic doorclosing apparatus 
where do this go inquire the man 
dyke sit down for a moment on a seat that have be remove from a wornout railway car to do duty in office 
on the back of a yellow envelope -PRON- make some vague figure with a stump of blue pencil multiplying subtract perplex -PRON- with many error 
behrman the clerk and the man with the doorclose apparatus involve -PRON- in a long argument gaze intently at the top panel of the door 
the man who have come to fix the apparatus be unwilling to guarantee -PRON- unless a sign be put on the outside of the door warn incomer that the door be selfclose 
this sign would cost fifteen cent extra 
but -PRON- didnot say anything about this when the thing be order declare behrman 
no i wonot pay -PRON- -PRON- friend an overcharge 
-PRON- neednot think observe the clerk that just because -PRON- be deal with the railroad -PRON- be go to work -PRON-

dyke go down the stair to the street and proceed onward aimlessly in the direction of the yosemite house finger the yellow envelope and look vacantly at the sidewalk 
there be a stoop to -PRON- massive shoulder 
-PRON- great arm dangle loosely at -PRON- side the palm of -PRON- hand open 
as -PRON- go along a certain feeling of shame touch -PRON-

no doubt every one recognise the unsuccessful man in the very way -PRON- slouch along 
the young girl in lawn muslin and garden hat return from the post office -PRON- hand full of letter must surely see in -PRON- the type of the failure the bankrupt 
then brusquely -PRON- tardy rage flame up

-PRON- gallop away along the low road in the direction of quien sabe emerge from the grove of cypress and eucalyptus about the ranch house and come out upon the bare brown plain of the wheat land stretch away from -PRON- in apparent barrenness on either hand 
-PRON- be late in the day already -PRON- shadow be long upon the pad dust of the road in front of -PRON- 
on ahead a long way off and a little to the north the venerable campanile of the mission san juan be glint radiant in the last ray of the sun while behind -PRON- towards the north and west the gilded dome of the courthouse at bonneville stand silhouetted in purplish black against the flame west 
annixter spur the buckskin forward 
-PRON- fear -PRON- may be late to -PRON- supper 
-PRON- wonder if -PRON- would be bring to -PRON- by hilma 
hilma 
the name strike across in -PRON- brain with a pleasant glow tremour 
all through that day of activity of strenuous business the minute and cautious planning of the final campaign in the great war of the league and the trust the idea of -PRON- and the recollection of -PRON- have be the undercurrent of -PRON- thought 
at last -PRON- be alone 
-PRON- could put all other thing behind -PRON- and occupy -PRON- solely with -PRON- 
in that glory of the day end in that chaos of sunshine -PRON- see -PRON- again 
unimaginative crude direct -PRON- fancy nevertheless place -PRON- before -PRON- steep in sunshine saturate with glorious light brilliant radiant alluring 
-PRON- see the sweet simplicity of -PRON- carriage the statuesque evenness of the contour of -PRON- figure the single deep swell of -PRON- bosom the solid masse of -PRON- hair 
-PRON- remember the small contradictory suggestion of feminine daintiness -PRON- have so often remark about -PRON- -PRON- slim narrow foot the little steel buckle of -PRON- low shoe the knot of black ribbon -PRON- have begin to wear of late on the back of -PRON- head and -PRON- hear -PRON- voice lowpitche velvety a sweet murmuring huskiness that seem to come more from -PRON- chest than from -PRON- throat 
the buckskin hoof clatter upon the gravelly flat of creek underneath the long trestle mind go back to the scene of the previous evening when -PRON- have come upon -PRON- at this place 
-PRON- set -PRON- tooth with anger and disappointment 
why have -PRON- not be able to understand 
what be the matter with these woman always set upon this marry notion 
be -PRON- not enough that -PRON- want -PRON- more than any other girl -PRON- know and that -PRON- want -PRON- 
-PRON- have say as much 
do -PRON- think -PRON- be go to be mistress of quien sabe 
ah that be -PRON- 
-PRON- be after -PRON- property be for marry -PRON- because of -PRON- money 
-PRON- unconquerable suspicion of the woman -PRON- innate distrust of the feminine element would not be do away with 
what fathomless duplicity be her that -PRON- could appear so innocent 
-PRON- be almost unbelievable in fact be -PRON- believable 
for the first time doubt assail -PRON- 
suppose hilma be indeed all that -PRON- appear to be 
suppose -PRON- be not with -PRON- a question of -PRON- property after all -PRON- be a poor time to think of marry -PRON- for -PRON- property when all quien sabe hang in the issue of the next few month 
suppose -PRON- have be sincere 
but -PRON- catch -PRON- up 
be -PRON- to be fool by a feemale girl at this late date 
-PRON- buck annixter crafty hardheade a man of affair 
not much 
whatever transpire -PRON- would remain the master 
-PRON- reach quien sabe in this frame of mind 
but at this hour annixter for all -PRON- resolution could no longer control -PRON- thought 
as -PRON- strip the saddle from the buckskin and lead -PRON- to the watering trough by the stable corral -PRON- heart be beat thick at the very notion of be near hilma again 
-PRON- be grow dark but covertly -PRON- glance here and there out of the corner of -PRON- eye to see if -PRON- be anywhere about -PRON- could not become possess of the idea that hilma would not inform -PRON- parent of what have pass between -PRON- the previous evening under the long trestle 
-PRON- have no idea that matter be at an end between -PRON- and the young woman 
-PRON- must apologise -PRON- see that clearly enough must eat crow as -PRON- tell -PRON- 
well -PRON- would eat crow 
-PRON- be not afraid of -PRON- any longer now that -PRON- have make -PRON- confession to -PRON- 
-PRON- would see -PRON- as soon as possible and get this business straighten out and begin again from a new starting point 
what -PRON- want with hilma annixter do not define clearly in -PRON- mind 
at one time -PRON- have know perfectly well what -PRON- want 
now the goal of -PRON- desire have become vague 
-PRON- could not say exactly what -PRON- be 
-PRON- prefer that thing should go forward without much idea of consequence if consequence come -PRON- would do so naturally enough and of -PRON- all that -PRON- positively know be that hilma occupy -PRON- thought morning noon and night that -PRON- be happy when -PRON- be with -PRON- and miserable when away from -PRON- 
the chinese cook serve -PRON- supper in silence 
annixter eat and drink and light a cigar and after -PRON- meal sit on the porch of -PRON- house smoking and enjoy the twilight 
the evening be beautiful warm the sky one powder of star 
from the direction of the stable -PRON- hear one of the portuguese hand pick a guitar 
but -PRON- want to see hilma 
the idea of go to bed without at least a glimpse of -PRON- become distasteful to -PRON- 
annixter get up and descend from the porch begin to walk aimlessly about between the ranch building with eye and ear alert 
possibly -PRON- may meet -PRON- somewhere 
the tree little house toward which inevitably annixter direct -PRON- step be dark 
have -PRON- all go to bed so soon 
-PRON- make a wide circuit about -PRON- listen but hear no sound 
the door of the dairyhouse stand ajar 
-PRON- push -PRON- open and step into the odorous darkness of -PRON- interior 
the pan and deep can of polished metal glow faintly from the corner and from the wall 
the smell of new cheese be pungent in -PRON- nostril 
everything be quiet 
there be nobody there 
-PRON- go out again close the door and stand for a moment in the space between the dairyhouse and the new barn uncertain as to what -PRON- should do next 
as -PRON- wait there -PRON- foreman come out of the men bunk house on the other side of the kitchen and cross over toward the barn 
hello billy mutter annixter as -PRON- pass

-PRON- turn on -PRON- heel and stride away straight before -PRON- not care where -PRON- be go 
-PRON- tramp out from the group of ranch building hold on over the open reach of -PRON- ranch -PRON- tooth set -PRON- heel dig furiously into the ground 
the minute pass 
-PRON- walk on swiftly mutter to -PRON- from time to time 
go by the lord

as yet -PRON- head be empty of all think 
-PRON- could not steady -PRON- wit to consider this new turn of affair 
-PRON- do not even try 
go by the lord -PRON- exclaim 
by the lord -PRON- s clear out 
-PRON- find the irrigate ditch and the beat path make by the ditch tender that border -PRON- and follow -PRON- some five minute then strike off at right angle over the rugged surface of the ranch land to where a great white stone jut from the ground 
there -PRON- sit down and lean forward rest -PRON- elbow on -PRON- knee and look out vaguely into the night -PRON- thought swiftly readjust -PRON- 
-PRON- be alone 
the silence of the night the infinite repose of the flat bare around and above -PRON- like illimitable sea 
a grey halflight mysterious grave flood downward from the star 
annixter be in torment 
now there could be no longer any -PRON- be hilma or nothing 
once out of -PRON- reach once lose to -PRON- and the recollection of -PRON- assail -PRON- with unconquerable vehemence 
much as -PRON- have occupy -PRON- mind -PRON- have never realise till now how vast have be the place -PRON- have fill in -PRON- life 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- as much but even then -PRON- do not believe -PRON- 
suddenly a bitter rage against -PRON- overwhelm -PRON- as -PRON- think of the hurt -PRON- have give -PRON- the previous evening 
-PRON- should have manage differently 
how -PRON- do not know but the sense of the outrage -PRON- have put upon -PRON- abruptly recoil against -PRON- with cruel force 
now -PRON- be sorry for -PRON- infinitely sorry passionately sorry 
-PRON- have hurt -PRON- 
-PRON- have bring the tear to -PRON- eye 
-PRON- have so flagrantly insult -PRON- that -PRON- could no longer bear to breathe the same air with -PRON- 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- parent all 
-PRON- have leave quien leave -PRON- for good at the very moment when -PRON- believe -PRON- have win -PRON- 
brute beast that -PRON- be -PRON- have drive -PRON- away 
an hour go by then two then four then six 
annixter still sit in -PRON- place grope and battle in a confusion of spirit the like of which -PRON- have never feel before 
-PRON- do not know what be the matter with -PRON- 
-PRON- could not find -PRON- way out of the dark and out of the turmoil that wheel around -PRON- 
-PRON- have have no experience with woman 
there be no precedent to guide -PRON- 
how be -PRON- to get out of this 
what be the clew that would set everything straight again 
that -PRON- would give hilma up never once enter -PRON- head 
have -PRON- -PRON- would 
-PRON- have give -PRON- to -PRON- 
everything should have be easy after that and instead here -PRON- be alone in the night wrestle with -PRON- in deep trouble than ever and hilma farther than ever away from -PRON- 
-PRON- be true -PRON- may have hilma even now if -PRON- be willing to marry -PRON- 
but marriage to -PRON- mind have be always a vague most remote possibility almost as vague and as remote as -PRON- thing that happen to some man but that would surely never occur to -PRON- or if -PRON- do -PRON- would be after long year have pass when -PRON- be old more settle more event that belong to the period of -PRON- middle life distant as yet 
-PRON- have never face the question of -PRON- marriage 
-PRON- have keep -PRON- at an immense distance from -PRON- 
-PRON- have never be a part of -PRON- order of thing 
-PRON- be not a marry man 
but hilma be an everpresent reality as near to -PRON- as -PRON- right hand 
marriage be a formless far distant abstraction 
hilma a tangible imminent fact 
before -PRON- could think of the two as one before -PRON- could consider the idea of marriage side by side with the idea of hilma measureless distance have to be traverse thing as disassociate in -PRON- mind as fire and water have to be fuse together and between the two -PRON- be tear as if upon a rack 
slowly by imperceptible degree the imagination unused unwilling machine begin to work 
the brain activity lapse proportionately 
-PRON- begin to think less and feel more 
in that rugged composition confuse dark harsh a furrow have be drive deep a little seed plant a little seed at first weak forget lose in the low dark place of -PRON- character 
but as the intellect move slow -PRON- function grow numb the idea of self dwindle 
annixter no longer consider -PRON- no longer consider the notion of marriage from the point of view of -PRON- own comfort -PRON- own wish -PRON- own advantage 
-PRON- realise that in -PRON- newfound desire to make -PRON- happy -PRON- be sincere 
there be something in that idea after all 
to make some one about that now 
-PRON- be worth thinking of 
far away low down in the east a dim belt a grey light begin to whiten over the horizon 
the tower of the mission stand black against -PRON- 
the dawn be come 
the baffling obscurity of the night be pass 
hide thing be come into view 
annixter -PRON- eye halfclose -PRON- chin upon -PRON- fist allow -PRON- imagination full play 
how would -PRON- be if -PRON- should take hilma into -PRON- life this beautiful young girl pure as -PRON- now know -PRON- to be innocent noble with the inborn nobility of dawn womanhood 
an overwhelming sense of -PRON- own unworthiness suddenly bear down upon -PRON- with crush force as -PRON- think of this 
-PRON- have go about the whole affair wrongly 
-PRON- have be mistake from the very first 
-PRON- be infinitely above -PRON- 
-PRON- do not should not desire to be the master 
-PRON- be -PRON- -PRON- servant poor simple lowly even who should condescend to -PRON- 
abruptly there be present to -PRON- mind eye a picture of the year to come if -PRON- now should follow -PRON- good -PRON- high -PRON- most unselfish impulse 
-PRON- see hilma -PRON- own for well or for bad for rich or for poor all barrier down between -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON- as freely as nobly as -PRON- have give -PRON- to -PRON- 
by a supreme effort not of the will but of the emotion -PRON- fight -PRON- way across that vast gulf that for a time have gape between hilma and the idea of -PRON- marriage 
instantly like the swift blending of beautiful colour like the harmony of beautiful chord of music the two idea melt into one and in that moment into -PRON- harsh unlovely world a new idea be bear 
annixter stand suddenly upright a mighty tenderness a gentleness of spirit such as -PRON- have never conceive of in -PRON- heart strain swell and in a moment seem to burst 
out of the dark furrow of -PRON- soul up from the deep rugged recess of -PRON- be something rise expand 
-PRON- open -PRON- arm wide 
an immense happiness overpower -PRON- 
actual tear come to -PRON- eye 
without know why -PRON- be not ashamed of -PRON- 
this poor crude fellow harsh hard narrow with -PRON- unlovely nature -PRON- fierce truculency -PRON- selfishness -PRON- obstinacy abruptly know that all the sweetness of life all the great vivify eternal force of humanity have burst into life within -PRON- 
the little seed long since plant gathering strength quietly have at last germinate 
then as the realisation of this harden into certainty in the grow light of the new day that have just dawn for -PRON- annixter utter a cry 
now at length -PRON- know the meaning of -PRON- all 
whyii i -PRON- -PRON- cry 
never until then have -PRON- occur to -PRON- 
never until then in all -PRON- thought of hilma have that great word pass -PRON- lip 
-PRON- be a memnonian cry the greeting of the hard harsh image of man roughhewn flinty granitic utter a note of joy acclaim the new rise sun 
by now -PRON- be almost day 
the east glowed opalescent 
all about -PRON- annixter see the land inundate with light 
but there be a change 
overnight something have occur 
in -PRON- perturbation the change seem to -PRON- at first elusive almost fanciful unreal 
but now as the light spread -PRON- look again at the gigantic scroll of ranch land unroll before -PRON- from edge to edge of the horizon 
the change be not fanciful 
the change be real 
the earth be no longer bare 
the land be no longer longer empty no longer dull brown 
all at once annixter shout aloud 
there -PRON- be the wheat the wheat 
the little seed long plant germinating in the deep dark furrow of the soil strain swell suddenly in one night have burst upward to the light 
the wheat have come up 
-PRON- be there before -PRON- around -PRON- everywhere illimitable immeasurable 
the winter brownness of the ground be overlay with a little shimmer of green 
the promise of the sowing be be fulfil 
the earth the loyal mother who never fail who never disappoint be keep -PRON- faith again 
once more the strength of nation be renew 
once more the force of the world be revivify 
once more the titan benignant calm stir and wake and the morning abruptly blaze into glory upon the spectacle of a man whose heart leap exuberant with the love of a woman and an exulting earth gleam transcendent with the radiant magnificence of an inviolable pledge room in the ranch house of los muertos be in the second story of the building 
-PRON- be a corner room one of -PRON- window face the south the other the east 
-PRON- appointment be of the simple 
in one angle be the small white painted iron bed cover with a white counterpane 
the wall be hang with a white paper figure with knot of pale green leave very gay and bright 
there be a straw matting on the floor 
white muslin halfcurtain hang in the window upon the sill of which certain plant bear pink waxen flower of which presley do not know the name grow in oblong green box 
the wall be unadorne save by two picture one a reproduction of the reading from homer the other a charcoal drawing of the mission of san juan de guadalajara which presley have make -PRON- 
by the east window stand the plain of deal table innocent of any cloth or cover such as may have be use in a kitchen 
-PRON- be work table and be invariably litter with paper halffinishe manuscript draft of poem notebook pen halfsmoke cigarette and the like 
near at hand upon a shelf be -PRON- book 
there be but two chair in the straight back wooden chair that stand in front of the table angular upright and in which -PRON- be impossible to take one ease and the long comfortable wicker steamer chair stretch -PRON- length in front of the south window 
presley be immensely fond of this room 
-PRON- amuse and interest -PRON- to maintain -PRON- air of rigorous simplicity and freshness 
-PRON- abhor cluttered and meaningless objets dart 
once in so often -PRON- submit -PRON- room to a vigorous inspection set -PRON- to right remove everything but the essential the few ornament which in a way be part of -PRON- life 
-PRON- writing have by this time undergo a complete change 
the note for -PRON- great song of the west the epic poem -PRON- once have hope to write -PRON- have fling aside together with all the abortive attempt at -PRON- beginning 
also -PRON- have tear up a great quantity of fugitive verse preserve only a certain halffinished poem that -PRON- call the toiler 
this poem be a comment upon the social fabric and have be inspire by the sight of a painting -PRON- have see in art gallery 
-PRON- have write all but the last verse 
on the day that -PRON- have overhear the conversation between dyke and caraher in the latter saloon which have acquaint -PRON- with the monstrous injustice of the increase tariff presley have return to los muertos white and trembling rouse to a pitch of exaltation the like of which -PRON- have never know in all -PRON- life 
-PRON- wrath be little short of even -PRON- too see red a mighty spirit of revolt heave tumultuous within -PRON- 
-PRON- do not seem possible that this outrage could go on much long 
the oppression be incredible the plain story of -PRON- set down in truthful statement of fact would not be believe by the outside world 
-PRON- go up to -PRON- little room and pace the floor with clench fist and burn face till at last the repression of -PRON- contend thought all but suffocate -PRON- and -PRON- fling -PRON- before -PRON- table and begin to write 
for a time -PRON- pen seem to travel of -PRON- word come to -PRON- without search shape -PRON- into phrase build -PRON- up to great forcible sentence full of eloquence of fire of passion 
as -PRON- prose grow more exalted -PRON- pass easily into the domain of poetry 
soon the cadence of -PRON- paragraph settle to an order beat and rhythm and in the end presley have thrust aside -PRON- journal and be once more writing verse 
-PRON- pick up -PRON- incomplete poem of the toiler read -PRON- hastily a couple of time to catch -PRON- swing then the idea of the last idea for which -PRON- so long have seek in springing to -PRON- brain write -PRON- off without so much as replenish -PRON- pen with ink 
-PRON- add still another verse bring the poem to a definite close resume -PRON- entire conception and end with a single majestic thought simple noble dignified absolutely convincing 
presley lay down -PRON- pen and lean back in -PRON- chair with the certainty that for one moment -PRON- have touch untrod height 
-PRON- hand be cold -PRON- head on fire -PRON- heart leap tumultuous in -PRON- breast 
now at last -PRON- have achieve 
-PRON- see why -PRON- have never grasp the inspiration for -PRON- vast vague song of the west 
at the time when -PRON- seek for -PRON- -PRON- conviction have not be arouse -PRON- have not then care for the people 
-PRON- sympathy have not be touch 
small wonder that -PRON- have miss -PRON- 
now -PRON- be of the people -PRON- have be stir to -PRON- low depth 
-PRON- earnestness be almost a frenzy 
-PRON- and so to -PRON- all thing be possible at once 
then the artist in -PRON- reassert -PRON- 
-PRON- become more interested in -PRON- poem as such than in the cause that have inspire -PRON- 
-PRON- go over -PRON- again retouch -PRON- carefully change a word here and there and improve -PRON- rhythm 
for the moment -PRON- forget the people forget -PRON- rage -PRON- agitation of the previous hour -PRON- remember only that -PRON- have write a great poem 
then doubt intrude 
after all be -PRON- so great 
do not -PRON- sublimity overpass a little the bound of the ridiculous 
have -PRON- see true 
have -PRON- fail again 
-PRON- reread the poem carefully and -PRON- seem all at once to lose force 
by now presley could not tell whether what -PRON- have write be true poetry or doggerel 
-PRON- distrust profoundly -PRON- own judgment 
-PRON- must have the opinion of some one else some one competent to judge 
-PRON- could not wait tomorrow would not do 
-PRON- must know to a certainty before -PRON- could rest that night 
-PRON- make a careful copy of what -PRON- have write and put on -PRON- hat and laced boot go down stair and out upon the lawn cross over to the stable 
-PRON- find phelps there wash down the buckboard 
do -PRON- know where vanamee be today -PRON- ask the latter 
phelp put -PRON- chin in the air 
ask -PRON- something easy -PRON- respond 
-PRON- may be at guadalajara or -PRON- may be up at or -PRON- may be a hundred mile away from either place 
i know where -PRON- ought to be mr presley but that ainot say where the crazy gesabe be 
-PRON- to be rangeride over east of four at the head water of mission creek try for -PRON- there at all event answer presley 
if -PRON- see harran when -PRON- come in tell -PRON- i may not be back in time for supper 
presley find the pony in the corral cinch the saddle upon -PRON- and go off over the low road go eastward at a brisk canter 
at -PRON- call a how do -PRON- do to minna whom -PRON- see lie in a slat hammock under the mammoth live oak -PRON- foot in bandage and then gallop on over the bridge across the irrigating ditch wonder vaguely what would become of such a pretty girl as minna and if in the end -PRON- would marry the portuguese foreman in charge of the ditchinggang 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- hope -PRON- would and that speedily 
there be no lack of comment as to minna hooven about the ranch 
certainly -PRON- be a good girl but -PRON- be see at all hour here and there about bonneville and guadalajara skylark with the portuguese farm hand of quien sabe and los muertos 
-PRON- be very pretty the man make fool of -PRON- over -PRON- 
presley hope -PRON- would not end by make a fool of -PRON- 
just beyond the irrigate ditch presley leave the low road and follow a trail that branch off southeasterly from this point hold on across the fourth division of the ranch keep the mission creek on -PRON- left 
a few mile farther on -PRON- go through a gate in a barbed wire fence and at once engage -PRON- in a system of little arroyo and low rolling hill that steadily lift and increase in size as -PRON- proceed 
this high ground be the advance guard of the sierra foothill and serve as the stock range for los muertos 
the hill be huge roll hummock of bare ground cover only by wild oat 
at long interval be isolate live oak 
in the canyon and arroyos the chaparral and manzanita grow in dark olivegreen thicket 
the ground be honeycomb with gopherhole and the gopher -PRON- be everywhere 
occasionally a jack rabbit bound across the open from one growth of chaparral to another take long leap -PRON- ear erect 
high overhead a hawk or two swing at anchor and once with a startling rush of wing a covey of quail flush from the brush at the side of the trail 
on the hillside in thinly scatter group be the cattle graze deliberately work slowly toward the waterhole for -PRON- evening drink the horse keep to -PRON- the colt nuzzle at -PRON- mother belly whisk -PRON- tail stamp -PRON- unshod foot 
but once in a remoter field solitary magnificent enormous the short hair curl tight upon -PRON- forehead -PRON- small red eye twinkle -PRON- vast neck heavy with muscle presley come upon the monarch the king the great durham bull maintain -PRON- lonely state unapproachable austere 
presley find the onetime shepherd by a waterhole in a far distant corner of the range 
-PRON- have make -PRON- simple camp for the night 
-PRON- bluegrey army blanket lie spread under a live oak -PRON- horse graze near at hand 
-PRON- -PRON- sit on -PRON- heel before a little fire of dead manzanita root cook -PRON- coffee and bacon 
never have presley conceive so keen an impression of loneliness as -PRON- crouch figure present 
the bald bare landscape widen about -PRON- to infinity 
vanamee be a spot in -PRON- all a tiny dot a single atom of human organisation float endlessly on the ocean of an illimitable nature 
the two friend eat together and vanamee have snare a brace of quail dress and then roast -PRON- on a sharpen stick 
after eat -PRON- drink great refreshing draught from the waterhole 
then at length presley have light -PRON- cigarette and vanamee -PRON- pipe the former say vanamee i have be write again 
vanamee turn -PRON- lean ascetic face toward -PRON- -PRON- black eye fix attentively know -PRON- say -PRON- journal 
no this be a poem 
-PRON- remember i tell -PRON- about -PRON- once 
the toiler i call -PRON- 
oh verse 
well i be glad -PRON- have go back to -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- natural vehicle 
-PRON- remember the poem ask presley 
-PRON- be unfinished 
yes i remember -PRON- 
there be well promise in -PRON- than anything -PRON- ever write 
now i suppose -PRON- have finish -PRON- 
without reply presley bring -PRON- from out the breast pocket of -PRON- shoot coat 
the moment seem propitious 
the stillness of the vast bare hill be profound 
the sun be set in a cloudless brazier of red light a golden dust pervade all the landscape 
presley read -PRON- poem aloud 
when -PRON- have finish -PRON- friend look at -PRON- 
what have -PRON- be do lately -PRON- demand 
presley wonder tell of -PRON- various coming and going donot mean that return the other 
something have happen to -PRON- something have arouse -PRON- 
i be right be i not 
yes i think so 
in this poem of -PRON- -PRON- have not be try to make a sounding piece of literature 
-PRON- write -PRON- under tremendous stress 
-PRON- very imperfection show that 
-PRON- be well than a mere rhyme 
-PRON- be an message 
-PRON- be truth 
-PRON- have come back to the primal heart of thing and -PRON- have see clearly 
yes -PRON- be a great poem 
thank -PRON- exclaim presley fervidly have begin to mistrust -PRON- 
now observed vanamee presume -PRON- will rush -PRON- into print 
to have formulate a great thought simply to have accomplish be not enough think i be sincere object presley 
if -PRON- be good -PRON- will do good to other 
-PRON- say -PRON- -PRON- be a message 
if -PRON- have any value i do not think -PRON- would be right to keep -PRON- back from even a very small and most indifferent public publish -PRON- in the magazine at all event vanamee answer 
-PRON- inspiration have come the people 
then let -PRON- go straight the the literary reader of the monthly periodical the rich who would only be indirectly interested 
if -PRON- must publish -PRON- let -PRON- be in the daily press interrupt 
i know what -PRON- will say 
-PRON- will be that the daily press be common be vulgar be undignified and i tell -PRON- that such a poem as this of -PRON- call as -PRON- be the toiler must be read the toiler 
-PRON- common -PRON- must be vulgarise 
-PRON- must not stand upon -PRON- dignity with the people if -PRON- be to reach -PRON- 
that be true i suppose presley admit but i canot get rid of the idea that -PRON- would be throw -PRON- poem away 
the great magazine give -PRON- suchabackground give -PRON- such weight 
give such weight give -PRON- such background 
be -PRON- -PRON- think of 
-PRON- helper of the helpless 
be that -PRON- sincerity 
-PRON- must sink -PRON- must forget -PRON- and -PRON- own desire of fame of admit success 
-PRON- be -PRON- -PRON- that must who write -PRON- 
-PRON- preach a doctrine of abnegation of selfobliteration and -PRON- sign -PRON- name to -PRON- word as high on the tablet as -PRON- can reach so that all the world may see not the poem but the poet 
presley there be many like -PRON- 
the social reformer write a book on the iniquity of the possession of land and out of the proceed buy a corner lot 
the economist who lament the hardship of the poor allow -PRON- to grow rich upon the sale of -PRON- book 
but presley would hear no further 
no -PRON- cry know i be sincere and to prove -PRON- to -PRON- i will publish -PRON- poem as -PRON- say in the daily press and i will accept no money for -PRON- 
-PRON- talk on for about an hour while the evening wear away 
presley very soon notice that vanamee be again preoccupy 
more than ever of late -PRON- silence -PRON- brooding have increase 
by and by -PRON- rise abruptly turn -PRON- head to the north in the direction of the mission church of san juan think -PRON- say to presley that i must be go 
go 
where to at this time of night 
off there 
vanamee make an uncertain gesture toward the north and without another word -PRON- disappear in the grey of the twilight 
presley be leave alone wonder 
-PRON- find -PRON- horse and tighten the girth mount and ride home under the sheen of the star thoughtful -PRON- head bow 
before -PRON- go to bed that night -PRON- send the toiler to the sunday editor of a daily newspaper in san francisco 
upon leave presley vanamee -PRON- thumb hooked into -PRON- empty cartridge belt strode swiftly down from the hill of the los muertos stockrange and on through the silent town of guadalajara 
-PRON- lean swarthy face with -PRON- hollow cheek fine black point beard and sad eye be set to the northward 
as be -PRON- custom -PRON- be bareheade and the rapidity of -PRON- stride make a breeze in -PRON- long black hair 
-PRON- know where -PRON- be go 
-PRON- know what -PRON- must live through that night 
again the deathless grief that never sleep leap out of the shadow and fasten upon -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- be scourge -PRON- back to that scene of a vanished happiness a dead romance a perished mission garden in the shade of the venerable pear tree 
but besides this other influence tug at -PRON- heart 
there be a mystery in the garden 
in that spot the night be not always empty the darkness not always silent 
something far off stir and listen to -PRON- cry at time draw nearer to -PRON- 
at first this presence have be a matter for terror but of late as -PRON- feel -PRON- gradually draw nearer the terror have at long interval give place to a feeling of an almost ineffable sweetness 
but distrust -PRON- own sense unwilling to submit -PRON- to such torture uncertain happiness averse to the terrible confusion of spirit that follow upon a night spend in the garden vanamee have try to keep away from the place 
however when the sorrow of -PRON- life reassail -PRON- and the thought and recollection of angele bring the ache into -PRON- heart and the tear to -PRON- eye the temptation to return to the garden invariably grip -PRON- close 
there be time when -PRON- could not resist 
of -PRON- -PRON- footstep turn in that direction 
-PRON- be almost as if -PRON- -PRON- have be call 
guadalajara be silent dark 
not even in be there a light 
the town be asleep 
only the inevitable guitar hum from an unseen dobe 
vanamee push on 
the smell of the field and open country and a distant scent of flower that -PRON- know well come to -PRON- nostril as -PRON- emerge from the town by way of the road that lead on towards the mission through quien sabe 
on either side of -PRON- lie the brown earth silently nurture the implanted seed 
two day before -PRON- have rain copiously and the soil still moist disengage a pungent aroma of fecundity 
vanamee follow the road pass through the collection of building of home ranch 
everything sleep 
at interval the aermotor on the artesian well creak audibly as -PRON- turn in a languid breeze from the northeast 
a cat hunting fieldmice creep from the shadow of the gigantic barn and pause uncertainly in the open the tip of -PRON- tail twitch 
from within the barn -PRON- come the sound of the friction of a heavy body and a stir of hoof as one of the dozing cow lie down with a long breath 
vanamee leave the ranch house behind -PRON- and proceed on -PRON- way 
beyond -PRON- to the right of the road -PRON- could make out the high ground in the mission enclosure and the watch tower of the mission -PRON- 
the minute pass 
-PRON- go steadily forward 
then abruptly -PRON- pause -PRON- head in the air eye and ear alert 
to that strange sixth sense of -PRON- responsive as the leave of the sensitive plant have suddenly come the impression of a human being near at hand 
-PRON- have neither see nor hear but for all that -PRON- stop an instant in -PRON- track then the sensation confirm go on again with slow step advance warily 
at last -PRON- swiftly rove eye light upon an object just dark than the greybrown of the nightridden land 
-PRON- be at some distance from the roadside 
vanamee approach -PRON- cautiously leave the road tread carefully upon the moist clod of earth underfoot 
twenty pace distant -PRON- halt 
annixter be there seat upon a round white rock -PRON- back towards -PRON- 
-PRON- be lean forward -PRON- elbow on -PRON- knee -PRON- chin in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- do not move 
silent motionless -PRON- gaze out upon the flat sombre land 
-PRON- be the night wherein the master of quien sabe work out -PRON- salvation struggle with self from dusk to dawn 
at the moment when vanamee come upon -PRON- the turmoil within -PRON- have only begin 
the heart of the man have not yet waken 
the night be young the dawn far distant and all around -PRON- the field of upturned clod lie bare and brown empty of all life unbroken by a single green shoot 
for a moment the lifecircle of these two man of so widely differ character touch each other there in the silence of the night under the star 
then silently vanamee withdraw go on -PRON- way wonder at the trouble that like -PRON- drive this hardheade man of affair untrouble by dream out into the night to brood over an empty land 
then speedily -PRON- forget all else 
the material world draw off from -PRON- 
reality dwindle to a point and vanish like the vanishing of a star at moonrise 
earthly thing dissolve and disappear as a strange unnamed essence flow in upon -PRON- 
a new atmosphere for -PRON- pervade -PRON- surrounding 
-PRON- enter the world of the vision of the legend of the miracle where all thing be possible 
-PRON- stand at the gate of the mission garden 
above -PRON- rise the ancient tower of the mission church 
through the arch at -PRON- summit where swing the spanish queen bell -PRON- see the slowburne star 
the silent bat with flicker wing throw -PRON- dancing shadow on the pallid surface of the venerable facade 
not the faint chirring of a cricket break the silence 
the bee be asleep 
in the grass in the tree deep in the calix of punka flower and magnolia bloom the gnat the caterpillar the beetle all the microscopic multitudinous life of the daytime drowse and doze 
not even the minute scuffling of a lizard over the warm worn pavement of the colonnade disturb the infinite repose the profound stillness 
only within the garden the intermittent trickling of the fountain make -PRON- hear flow steadily mark off the lapse of second the progress of hour the cycle of year the inevitable march of century 
at one time the doorway before which vanamee now stand have be hermetically close 
but -PRON- -PRON- have long since change that 
-PRON- stand before -PRON- for a moment steep -PRON- in the mystery and romance of the place then raise -PRON- latch push open the gate enter and close -PRON- softly behind -PRON- 
-PRON- be in the cloister garden 
the star be out strew thick and close in the deep blue of the sky the milky way glow like a silver veil 
ursa major wheeled gigantic in the north 
the great nebula in orion be a whorl of shimmer star dust 
venus flame a lambent disk of pale saffron low over the horizon 
from edge to edge of the world march the constellation like the progress of emperor and from the innumerable glory of -PRON- course a mysterious sheen of diaphanous light disengage -PRON- expand over all the earth serene infinite majestic 
the little garden reveal -PRON- but dimly beneath the brooding light only half emerge from the shadow 
the polished surface of the leave of the pear tree wink faintly back the reflect light as the tree just stir in the uncertain breeze 
a blur shield of silver mark the ripple of the fountain 
under the flood of dull blue lustre the gravel walk lie vague amid the grass like webs of white satin on the bed of a lake 
against the eastern wall the headstone of the grave an indistinct procession of grey cowl range -PRON- 
vanamee cross the garden pause to kiss the turf upon grave 
then -PRON- approach the line of pear tree and lay -PRON- down in -PRON- shadow -PRON- chin prop upon -PRON- hand -PRON- eye wander over the expanse of the little valley that stretch away from the foot of the hill upon which the mission be build 
once again -PRON- summon the vision 
once again -PRON- conjure up the illusion 
once again torture with doubt rack with a deathless grief -PRON- crave an answer of the night 
once again mystic that -PRON- be -PRON- send -PRON- mind out from -PRON- across the enchanted sea of the supernatural 
hope of what -PRON- do not know rouse up within -PRON- 
surely on such a night as this the hallucination must define -PRON- 
surely the manifestation must be vouchsafed 
-PRON- eye close -PRON- will gird -PRON- to a supreme effort -PRON- sense exalt to a state of please numbness -PRON- call upon angele to come to -PRON- -PRON- voiceless cry penetrate far out into that sea of faint ephemeral light that float tideless over the little valley beneath -PRON- 
then motionless prone upon the ground -PRON- wait 
month have pass since that first night when at length an answer have come to vanamee 
at first startle out of all composure trouble and stir to -PRON- low depth because of the very thing for which -PRON- seek -PRON- resolve never again to put -PRON- strange power to the test 
but for all that -PRON- have come a second night to the garden and a third and a fourth 
at last -PRON- visit be habitual 
night after night -PRON- be there surrender -PRON- to the influence of the place gradually convince that something do actually answer when -PRON- call 
-PRON- faith increase as the winter grow into spring 
as the spring advance and the night become short -PRON- crystallise into certainty 
would -PRON- have -PRON- again -PRON- love long dead 
would -PRON- come to -PRON- once more out of the grave out of the night 
-PRON- could not tell -PRON- could only hope 
all that -PRON- know be that -PRON- cry find an answer that -PRON- outstretche hand grope in the darkness meet the touch of other finger 
patiently -PRON- wait 
the night become warm as the spring draw on 
the star shine clear 
the night seem bright 
for nearly a month after the occasion of -PRON- first answer nothing new occurred 
some night -PRON- fail -PRON- entirely upon other -PRON- be faint illusive 
then at last the most subtle the bare of perceptible change begin 
-PRON- grope mind faroff there wander like a lose bird over the valley touch upon some thing again touch and hold -PRON- and this time draw -PRON- a single step closer to -PRON- 
-PRON- heart beat the blood surge in -PRON- temple -PRON- watch with the eye of -PRON- imagination this gradual approach 
what be come to -PRON- 
who be come to -PRON- 
shroud in the obscurity of the night whose be the face now turn towards -PRON- 
whose the footstep that with such infinite slowness draw nearer to where -PRON- wait 
-PRON- do not dare to say 
-PRON- mind go back many year to that time before the tragedy of death before the mystery of the other 
-PRON- wait then as -PRON- wait now 
but then -PRON- have not wait in vain 
then as now -PRON- have seem to feel -PRON- approach seem to feel -PRON- draw nearer and nearer to -PRON- rendezvous 
now what would happen 
-PRON- do not know 
-PRON- wait 
-PRON- wait hope all thing 
-PRON- wait believe all thing 
-PRON- wait endure all thing 
-PRON- trust in the vision 
meanwhile as spring advance the flower in the seed ranch begin to come to life 
over the five hundred acre whereon the flower be plant the widen growth of vine and bush spread like the wave of a green sea 
then timidly colour of the faint tint begin to appear 
under the moonlight vanamee see -PRON- expand delicate pink faint blue tender variation of lavender and yellow white shimmer with reflection of gold all subdued and pallid in the moonlight 
by degree the night become impregnate with the perfume of the flower 
illusive at first evanescent as filament of gossamer then as the bud open emphasise -PRON- breathe deeper strong 
an exquisite mingling of many odour pass continually over the mission from the garden of the seed ranch meeting and blend with the aroma of -PRON- magnolia bud and punka blossom 
as the colour of the flower of the seed ranch deepen and as -PRON- odour penetrate deeper and more distinctly as the starlight of each succeed night grow bright and the air become warm the illusion define -PRON- 
by imperceptible degree as vanamee wait under the shadow of the pear tree the answer grow nearer and nearer 
-PRON- see nothing but the distant glimmer of the flower 
-PRON- hear nothing but the drip of the fountain 
nothing move about -PRON- but the invisible slowpassing breath of perfume yet -PRON- feel the approach of the vision 
-PRON- come first to about the middle of the seed ranch -PRON- some half a mile away where the violet grow shrink timid flower hide close to the ground 
then -PRON- pass forward beyond the violet and draw nearer and stand amid the mignonette hardy bloom that dare look heavenward from out the leave 
a few night later -PRON- leave the mignonette behind and advanced into the bed of white iris that push more boldly forth from the earth -PRON- waxen petal claim the attention 
-PRON- advance then a long step into the proud challenging beauty of the carnation and rose and at last after many night vanamee feel that -PRON- pause as if tremble at -PRON- hardihood full in the superb glory of the royal lily -PRON- that grow on the extreme border of the seed ranch nearest to -PRON- 
after this there be a certain long wait 
then upon a dark midnight -PRON- advance again 
vanamee could scarcely repress a cry 
now the illusion emerge from the flower 
-PRON- stand not distant but unseen almost at the base of the hill upon whose crest -PRON- wait in a depression of the ground where the shadow lie thick 
-PRON- be nearly within earshot 
the night pass 
the spring grow warm 
in the daytime intermittent rain freshen all the earth 
the flower of the seed ranch grow rapidly 
bud after bud burst forth while those already open expand to full maturity 
the colour of the seed ranch deepen 
one night after hour of wait vanamee feel upon -PRON- cheek the touch of a prolong puff of warm wind breathe across the little valley from out the east 
-PRON- reach the mission garden and stir the branch of the pear tree 
-PRON- seem veritably to be compound of the very essence of the flower 
never have the aroma be so sweet so pervasive 
-PRON- pass and fade leave in -PRON- wake an absolute silence 
then at length the silence of the night that silence to which vanamee have so long appeal be break by a tiny sound 
alert halfrisen from the ground -PRON- listen for now at length -PRON- hear something 
the sound repeat -PRON- 
-PRON- come from near at hand from the thick shadow at the foot of the hill 
what -PRON- be -PRON- could not tell but -PRON- do not belong to a single one of the infinite similar noise of the place with which -PRON- be so familiar 
-PRON- be neither the rustle of a leaf the snap of a parted twig the drone of an insect the dropping of a magnolia blossom 
-PRON- be a vibration merely faint elusive impossible of definition a minute notch in the fine keen edge of stillness 
again the night pass 
the summer star become bright 
the warmth increase 
the flower of the seed ranch grow still more 
the five hundred acre of the ranch be carpet with -PRON- 
at length upon a certain midnight a new light begin to spread in the sky 
the thin scimitar of the moon rise veil and dim behind the earthmist 
the light increase 
distant object until now hide come into view and as the radiance brighten vanamee look down upon the little valley see a spectacle of incomparable beauty 
all the bud of the seed ranch have open 
the faint tint of the flower have deepen have assert -PRON- 
-PRON- challenge the eye 
pink become a royal red 
blue rise into purple 
yellow flame into orange 
orange glow golden and brilliant 
the earth disappear under great band and field of resplendent colour 
then at length the moon abruptly soar zenithward from out the veil mist pass from one filmy haze to another 
for a moment there be a gleam of a golden light and vanamee -PRON- eye search the shade at the foot of the hill feel -PRON- heart suddenly leap and then hang poise refuse to beat 
in that instant of pass light something have catch -PRON- eye 
something that move down there half in and half out of the shadow at the hill foot 
-PRON- have come and go in an instant 
the haze once more screen the moonlight 
the shade again engulf the vision 
what be -PRON- -PRON- have see 
-PRON- do not know 
so brief have be that movement the drowsy brain have not be quick enough to interpret the cipher message of the eye 
now -PRON- be go 
but something have be there 
-PRON- have see -PRON- 
be -PRON- the lifting of a strand of hair the wave of a white hand the flutter of a garment edge 
-PRON- could not tell but -PRON- do not belong to any of those sight which -PRON- have see so often in that place 
-PRON- be neither the glancing of a moth wing the nodding of a windtouched blossom nor the noiseless flitting of a bat 
-PRON- be a gleam merely faint elusive impossible of definition an intangible agitation in the vast dim blur of the darkness 
and that be all 
until now no single real thing have occur nothing that vanamee could reduce to term of actuality nothing -PRON- could put into word 
the manifestation when not recognisable to that strange sixth sense of -PRON- appeal only to the most refined the most delicate perception of eye and ear 
-PRON- be all ephemeral filmy dreamy the mystic forming of the invisible develop a concrete nucleus the starlight coagulate the radiance of the flower thicken to something actual perfume the most delicious fragrance become a tangible presence 
but into that garden the serpent intrude 
though cradle in the slow rhythm of the dream lull by this beauty of a summer night heavy with the scent of flower the silence break only by a ripple fountain the darkness illuminate by a world of radiant blossom vanamee could not forget the tragedy of the other that terror of many year prowler of the night that strange fearful figure with the unseen face swoop in there from out the darkness go in an instant yet leave behind the trail and trace of death and of pollution 
never have vanamee see this more clearly than when leave presley on the stock range of los muerto -PRON- have come across to the mission garden by way of the quien sabe ranch 
-PRON- be the same night in which annixter outwatche the star come at last to -PRON- 
as the hour pass the two man far apart ignore each other wait for the on the ranch vanamee in the garden 
prone upon -PRON- face under the pear tree -PRON- forehead bury in the hollow of -PRON- arm vanamee lie motionless 
for the last time raise -PRON- head -PRON- send -PRON- voiceless cry out into the night across the multicoloured level of the little valley call upon the miracle summon the darkness to give angele back to -PRON- resign -PRON- to the hallucination 
-PRON- bow -PRON- head upon -PRON- arm again and wait 
the minute pass 
the fountain drip steadily 
over the hill a haze of saffron light foretell the rising of the full moon 
nothing stir 
the silence be profound 
then abruptly right hand shut tight upon -PRON- wrist -PRON- be 
-PRON- begin again -PRON- invocation be answer 
far off there the ripple form again upon the still black pool of the night 
no sound no sight vibration merely appreciable by some sublimated faculty of the mind as yet unnamed 
rigid -PRON- nerve taut motionless prone on the ground -PRON- wait 
-PRON- advance with infinite slowness 
now -PRON- pass through the bed of violet now through the mignonette 
a moment later and -PRON- know -PRON- stand among the white iris 
then -PRON- leave those behind 
-PRON- be in the splendour of the red rose and carnation 
-PRON- pass like a move star into the superb abundance the imperial opulence of the royal lily 
-PRON- be advance slowly but there be no pause 
-PRON- hold -PRON- breath not dare to raise -PRON- head 
-PRON- pass beyond the limit of the seed ranch and enter the shade at the foot of the hill below -PRON- 
would -PRON- come farther than this 
here -PRON- have always stop hitherto stop for a moment and then in spite of -PRON- effort have slip from -PRON- grasp and fade back into the night 
but now -PRON- wonder if -PRON- have be willing to put forth -PRON- utmost strength after all 
have there not always be an element of dread in the thought of behold the mystery face to face 
have -PRON- not even allow the vision to dissolve the answer to recede into the obscurity whence -PRON- come 
but never a night have be so beautiful as this 
-PRON- be the full period of the spring 
the air be a veritable caress 
the infinite repose of the little garden sleep under the night be delicious beyond expression 
-PRON- be a tiny corner of the world shut off discreet distil romance a garden of dream of enchantment 
below in the little valley the resplendent colouration of the million flower rose lily hyacinth carnation violet glow like incandescence in the golden light of the rise moon 
the air be thick with the perfume heavy with -PRON- clog with -PRON- 
the sweetness fill the very mouth 
the throat choke with -PRON- 
overhead wheel the illimitable procession of the constellation 
underfoot the earth be asleep 
the very flower be dream 
a cathedral hush overlay all the land and a sense of benediction brood divine kindliness manifest -PRON- in beauty in peace in absolute repose 
-PRON- be a time for vision 
-PRON- be the hour when dream come true and lie deep in the grass beneath the pear tree vanamee dizzy with mysticism reach up and out toward the supernatural feel as -PRON- be -PRON- mind begin to rise upward from out -PRON- body 
-PRON- pass into a state of be the like of which -PRON- have not know before 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- imagination be reshape -PRON- prepare to receive an impression never experience until now 
-PRON- body feel light to -PRON- then -PRON- dwindle vanish 
-PRON- see with new eye hear with new ear feel with a new heart 
come to -PRON- -PRON- murmur 
then slowly -PRON- feel the advance of the vision 
-PRON- be approach 
every instant -PRON- draw gradually near 
at last -PRON- be to see 
-PRON- have leave the shadow at the base of the hill -PRON- be on the hill -PRON- 
slowly steadily -PRON- ascend the slope just below -PRON- there -PRON- hear a faint stirring 
the grass rustle under the touch of a foot 
the leave of the bush murmur as a hand brush against -PRON- a slend twig creak 
the sound of approach be more distinct 
-PRON- come nearer 
-PRON- reach the top of the hill 
-PRON- be within whisper distance 
vanamee trembling keep -PRON- head bury in -PRON- arm 
the sound at length pause definitely 
the vision could come no nearer 
-PRON- raise -PRON- head and look 
the moon have rise 
-PRON- great shield of gold stand over the eastern horizon 
within six foot of vanamee clear and distinct against the disk of the moon stand the figure of a young girl 
-PRON- be dress in a gown of scarlet silk with flow sleeve such as japanese wear embroider with flower and figure of bird work in gold thread 
on either side of -PRON- face make threecornere -PRON- round white forehead hang the soft masse of -PRON- hair of gold 
-PRON- hand hang limply at -PRON- side 
but from between -PRON- part of almost an egyptian breath come slow and regular and -PRON- eye heavy lidded slanting upwards toward the temple perplex oriental be closed 
-PRON- be asleep 
from out this life of flower this world of colour this atmosphere oppressive with perfume this darkness clog and cloy and thicken with sweet odour -PRON- come to -PRON- 
-PRON- come to -PRON- from out of the flower the smell of the rose in -PRON- hair of gold the aroma and the imperial red of the carnation in -PRON- lip the whiteness of the lily the perfume of the lily and the lily slender balance grace in -PRON- neck 
-PRON- hand disengage the scent of the heliotrope 
the fold of -PRON- scarlet gown give off the enervate smell of poppy 
-PRON- foot be redolent of hyacinth 
-PRON- stand before -PRON- a vision dream come true 
-PRON- emerge from out the invisible 
-PRON- behold -PRON- a figure of gold and pale vermilion redolent of perfume poise motionless in the faint saffron sheen of the newrisen moon 
-PRON- a creation of sleep be -PRON- asleep 
-PRON- a dream be -PRON- dream 
call forth from out the darkness from the grip of the earth the embrace of the grave from out the memory of corruption -PRON- rise into light and life divinely pure 
across that white forehead be no smudge no trace of an earthly mark of a terrestrial dishonour 
-PRON- see in -PRON- the same beauty of untainted innocence -PRON- have know in -PRON- youth 
year have make no difference with -PRON- 
-PRON- be still young 
-PRON- be the old purity that return the deathless beauty the everrenascent life the eternal consecrate and immortal youth 
for a few second -PRON- stand there before -PRON- and -PRON- upon the ground at -PRON- foot look up at -PRON- spellbound 
then slowly -PRON- withdraw 
still asleep -PRON- eyelid close -PRON- turn from -PRON- descend the slope 
-PRON- be go 
vanamee start up come as -PRON- be to -PRON- look wildly about -PRON- 
sarria be there see -PRON- say the priest 
-PRON- be angele the little girl -PRON- daughter 
-PRON- be like -PRON- mother 
but vanamee scarcely hear 
-PRON- walk as if in a trance push by sarria go forth from the garden 
angele or daughter -PRON- be all one with -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- 
death be overcome 
the grave vanquish 
life everrenewe alone exist 
time be naught change be naught all thing be immortal but evil all thing eternal but grief 
suddenly the dawn come the east burn roseate toward the zenith 
vanamee walk on -PRON- know not where 
the dawn grow bright 
at length -PRON- pause upon the crest of a hill overlook the ranchos and cast -PRON- eye below -PRON- to the southward 
then suddenly fling up -PRON- arm -PRON- utter a great cry 
there -PRON- be 
the wheat 
the wheat 
in the night -PRON- have come up 
-PRON- be there everywhere from margin to margin of the horizon 
the earth long empty teem with green life 
once more the pendulum of the season swing in -PRON- mighty arc from death back to life 
life out of death eternity rise from out dissolution 
there be the lesson 
angele be not the symbol but the of immortality 
the seed die rot and corrupt in the earth rise again in life unconquerable and in immaculate die as -PRON- give birth to -PRON- little daughter life spring from -PRON- pure unconquerable come forth from the defiled 
why have -PRON- not have the knowledge of god 
thou fool that which thou sowest be not quicken except -PRON- die 
so the seed have die 
so die angele 
and that which thou sow thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain 
-PRON- may chance of wheat or of some other grain 
the wheat call forth from out the darkness from out the grip of the earth of the grave from out corruption rise triumphant into light and life 
so angele so life so also the resurrection of the dead 
-PRON- be sow in corruption 
-PRON- be raise in incorruption 
-PRON- be sow in dishonour 
-PRON- be raise in glory 
-PRON- be sow in weakness 
-PRON- be raise in power 
death be swallow up in victory

then as the glory of sun banish the less glory of moon and star vanamee from -PRON- mountain top behold the eternal green life of the grow wheat burst -PRON- bond and in -PRON- heart exult in -PRON- triumph over the grave fling out -PRON- arm with a mighty shout oh death where be thy sting 
oh grave where be thy victory 
socialistic poem the toiler have an enormous success 
the editor of the sunday supplement of the san francisco paper to which -PRON- be send print -PRON- in gothic type with a scarehead title so decorative as to be almost illegible and furthermore cause the poem to be illustrate by one of the paper staff artist in a most impressive fashion 
the whole affair occupy an entire page 
thus advertise the poem attract attention 
-PRON- be promptly copy in new york boston and chicago paper 
-PRON- be discuss attack defended eulogise ridicule 
-PRON- be praise with the most fulsome adulation assail with the most violent condemnation 
editorial be write upon -PRON- 
special article in literary pamphlet dissect -PRON- rhetoric and prosody 
the phrase be use as text for revolutionary sermon reactionary speech 
-PRON- be parody -PRON- be distort so as to read as an advertisement for patented cereal and infant food 
finally the editor of an enterprise monthly magazine reprint the poem supplement -PRON- by a photograph and biography of presley -PRON- 
presley be stun bewilder 
-PRON- begin to wonder at -PRON- 
be -PRON- actually the great american poet since bryant 
-PRON- have have no thought of fame while compose the toiler 
-PRON- have only be move to -PRON- heart in earnest seeing have address -PRON- to the poem composition in a happy moment when word come easily to -PRON- and the elaboration of fine sentence be not difficult 
be -PRON- thus fame be achieve 
for a while -PRON- be tempt to cross the continent and go to new york and there come unto -PRON- own enjoy the triumph that await -PRON- 
but soon -PRON- deny -PRON- this cheap reward 
now -PRON- be too much in earnest 
-PRON- want to help -PRON- people the community in which -PRON- little world of the san joaquin at grapple with the railroad 
the struggle have find -PRON- poet 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- place be here 
only the word of the manager of a lecture bureau trouble -PRON- for a moment 
to range the entire nation tell all -PRON- countryman of the drama that be work -PRON- out on this fringe of the continent this ignore and distant pacific coast rouse -PRON- interest and stir -PRON- up to to -PRON- 
-PRON- may do great good 
to devote -PRON- to the cause accept no penny of remuneration to give -PRON- life to loose the grip of the ironhearte monster of steel and steam would be beyond question heroic 
other state than california have -PRON- grievance 
all over the country the family of cyclop be grow 
-PRON- would declare -PRON- the champion of the people in -PRON- opposition to the trust 
-PRON- would be an apostle a prophet a martyr of freedom 
but presley be essentially a dreamer not a man of affair 
-PRON- hesitate to act at this precise psychological moment strike while the iron be yet hot and while -PRON- hesitate other affair near at hand begin to absorb -PRON- attention 
one night about an hour after -PRON- have go to bed -PRON- be awaken by the sound of voice on the porch of the ranch house and descend find mrs dyke there with sidney 
the mother be talk to magnus and harran and cry as -PRON- talk 
-PRON- seem that dyke be miss 
-PRON- have go into town early that afternoon with the wagon and team and be to have be home for supper 
by now -PRON- be ten oclock and there be no news of -PRON- 
mrs dyke tell how -PRON- first have go to quien sabe intend to telephone from there to bonneville but annixter be in san francisco and in -PRON- absence the house be lock up and the overseer who have a duplicate key be -PRON- in bonneville 
-PRON- have telegraph three time from guadalajara to bonneville for news of -PRON- son but without result 
then at last torture with anxiety -PRON- have go to take sidney with -PRON- and have prevail upon bismarck to hitch up and drive -PRON- across los muertos to the to beg -PRON- to telephone into bonneville to know what have become of dyke 
while harran rang up central in town mrs dyke tell presley and magnus of the lamentable change in dyke 
-PRON- have break -PRON- son spirit mr derrick -PRON- say 
if -PRON- be only there to see 
hour after hour -PRON- sit on the porch with -PRON- hand lie open in -PRON- lap look at -PRON- without a word 
-PRON- wonot look -PRON- in the face any more and -PRON- donot sleep 
night after night -PRON- have walk the floor until morning 
and -PRON- will go on that way for day together very silent without a word and sit still in -PRON- chair and then all of a sudden -PRON- will break outoh mr derrick -PRON- be an awful rage curse swear grind -PRON- tooth -PRON- hand clench over -PRON- head stamp so that the house shake and say that if behrman donot give -PRON- back -PRON- money -PRON- will kill -PRON- with -PRON- two hand 
but that isnot the bad mr derrick 
-PRON- go to mr saloon now and stay there for hour and listen to mr caraher 
there be something on -PRON- son mind i know there that -PRON- and mr caraher have talk over together and i canot find out what -PRON- be 
mr caraher be a bad man and -PRON- son have fall under -PRON- influence 
the tear fill -PRON- eye 
bravely -PRON- turn to hide -PRON- turn away to take sidney in -PRON- arm put -PRON- head upon the little girl shoulder havenot break down before mr derrick -PRON- say but after -PRON- have be so happy in -PRON- little house just -PRON- the future seem so brightoh god will punish the gentleman who own the railroad for be so hard and cruel 
harran come out on the porch from the telephone and -PRON- interrupt -PRON- fix -PRON- eye eagerly upon -PRON- think -PRON- be all right mrs dyke -PRON- say reassuringly 
-PRON- know where -PRON- be i believe 
-PRON- and the little tad stay here and hooven and i will go after -PRON- 
about two hour later harran bring dyke back to los muerto in wagon 
-PRON- have find -PRON- at saloon very drunk 
there be nothing maudlin about drunkenness 
in -PRON- the alcohol merely rouse the spirit of evil vengeful reckless 
as the wagon pass out from under the eucalyptus tree about the ranch house take mrs dyke sidney and the onetime engineer back to the hop ranch presley lean from -PRON- window hear the latter remark caraher be right 
there be only one thing -PRON- listen to and that s dynamite 
the follow day presley drive magnus over to guadalajara to take the train for san francisco 
but after -PRON- have say goodbye to the governor -PRON- be move to go on to the hop ranch to see the condition of affair in that quarter 
-PRON- return to los muerto overwhelm with sadness and tremble with anger 
the hop ranch that -PRON- have last see in the full tide of prosperity be almost a ruin 
work have evidently be abandon long since 
weed be already choke the vine 
everywhere the pole sag and droop 
many have even fall drag the vine with -PRON- spread -PRON- over the ground in an inextricable tangle of dead leave decay tendril and snarl string 
the fence be break the unfinished storehouse which never be to see completion be a lamentable spectacle of gape door and melancholy skeleton 
last of all presley have catch a glimpse of dyke -PRON- seat in -PRON- rock chair on the porch -PRON- beard and hair unkempt motionless look with vague eye upon -PRON- hand that lay palm upwards and idle in -PRON- lap 
magnus on -PRON- way to san francisco be join at bonneville by osterman 
upon seat -PRON- in front of the master of los muertos in the smokingcar of the train this latter push back -PRON- hat and smooth -PRON- bald head observe governor -PRON- look all frazele out 
anything wrong these day 
the other answer in the negative but for all that osterman be right 
the governor have age suddenly 
-PRON- former erectness be go the broad shoulder stoop a little the strong line of -PRON- thinlippe mouth be relaxed and -PRON- hand as -PRON- clasp over the yellowed ivory knob of -PRON- cane have an unwonted tremulousness not hitherto noticeable 
but the change in magnus be more than physical 
at last in the full tide of power president of the league know and talk of in every county of the state leader in a great struggle consult defer to as the prominent man at length attain that position so long and vainly seek for -PRON- yet find no pleasure in -PRON- triumph and little but bitterness in life 
-PRON- success have come by devious method have be reach by obscure mean 
-PRON- be a briber 
-PRON- could never forget that 
to further -PRON- end disintereste publicspirite even philanthropic as those be -PRON- have connive with knavery -PRON- the politician of the old school of such rigorous integrity who have abandon a career rather than compromise with honesty 
at this eleventh hour involve and entrap in the finespun web of a new order of thing bewilder by dexterity by -PRON- volubility and glibness goad and harass beyond the point of reason by the aggression of the trust -PRON- fight -PRON- have at last fail 
-PRON- have fall -PRON- have give a bribe 
-PRON- have think that after all this would make but little difference with -PRON- 
the affair be know only to osterman broderson and annixter -PRON- would not judge -PRON- be -PRON- involved 
-PRON- could still preserve a bold front could still hold -PRON- head high 
as time go on the affair would lose -PRON- point 
but this be not so 
some subtle element of -PRON- character have forsake -PRON- 
-PRON- feel -PRON- 
-PRON- know -PRON- 
some certain stiffness that have give -PRON- all -PRON- rigidity that have lend force to -PRON- authority weight to -PRON- dominance temper to -PRON- fine inflexible hardness be diminish day by day 
in the decision which -PRON- as president of the league be call upon to make so often -PRON- now hesitate 
-PRON- could no longer be arrogant masterful acting upon -PRON- own judgment independent of opinion 
-PRON- begin to consult -PRON- lieutenant ask -PRON- advice distrust -PRON- own opinion 
-PRON- make mistake blunder and when those be bring to -PRON- notice take refuge in bluster 
-PRON- know -PRON- to be that sooner or later -PRON- subordinate would recognise -PRON- as such 
how long could -PRON- maintain -PRON- position 
so only -PRON- could keep -PRON- grip upon the lever of control till the battle be over all would be well 
if not -PRON- would fall and once fall -PRON- know that now briber that -PRON- be -PRON- would never rise again 
-PRON- be on -PRON- way at this moment to the city to consult with lyman as to a certain issue of the contest between the railroad and the rancher which of late have be bring to -PRON- notice 
when appeal have be take to the supreme court by the executive committee certain test case have be choose which should represent all the land in question 
neither magnus nor annixter have so appeal believe of course that -PRON- case be cover by the test case on trial at washington 
magnus have here blunder again and the agent in san francisco have write to warn -PRON- that the railroad may be able to take advantage of a technicality and by pretend that neither quien sabe nor los muerto be include in the appeal attempt to put -PRON- dummy buyer in possession of the two ranch before the supreme court hand down -PRON- decision 
the ninety day allow for take this appeal be nearly at an end and after then the railroad could act 
osterman and magnus at once decide to go up to the city there join annixter who have be absent from quien sabe for the last ten day and talk the matter over with lyman 
lyman because of -PRON- position as commissioner may be cognisant of the plan and at the same time could give sound legal advice as to what be to be do should the new rumour prove true 
say remark osterman as the train pull out of the bonneville station and the two man settle -PRON- for the long journey say governor what s all up with buck annixter these day get a bean about something sure have not notice answer magnus 
mr annixter have be away some time lately 
i can not imagine what should keep -PRON- so long in san francisco -PRON- say osterman wink

have to josh -PRON- about -PRON- when i see -PRON- sure 
but when osterman and magnus at last fall in with annixter in the vestibule of the lick house on montgomery street nothing could be get out of -PRON- 
-PRON- be in an execrable humour 
when magnu have broach the subject of business -PRON- have declare that all business could go to pot and when osterman -PRON- tongue in -PRON- cheek have permit -PRON- a most distant allusion to a feemale girl annixter have curse -PRON- for a busyface so vociferously and tersely that even osterman be cow 
well insinuated osterman what be -PRON- dally round frisco so much for 
cat fur to make kittenbreeche retort annixter with oracular vagueness 
two week before this time annixter have come up to the city and have go at once to a certain hotel on bush street behind the first national bank that -PRON- know be keep by a family connection of the tree 
in -PRON- conjecture that hilma and -PRON- parent would stop here -PRON- be right

-PRON- remember the day -PRON- have spend in the little dairyhouse happy in -PRON- work make butter and cheese skim the great pan of milk scour the copper vessel and vat plunge -PRON- arm elbow deep into the white curd come and go in that atmosphere of freshness cleanliness and sunlight gay singing supremely happy just because the sun shine 
-PRON- remember -PRON- long walk toward the mission late in the afternoon -PRON- excursion for cress underneath the long trestle the crowing of the cock the distant whistle of the pass train the faint sounding of the angelus 
-PRON- recall with infinite long the solitary expanse of the ranch the level reach between the horizon full of light and silence the heat at noon the cloudless iridescence of the sunrise and sunset 
-PRON- have be so happy in that life 
now all those day be pass 
this crude raw city with -PRON- crowd house all of wood and tin -PRON- blotting fog -PRON- uproarious trade wind disturb and sadden -PRON-

magnus say lyman would be present at the session 
annixter curious for detail forbore nevertheless to question 
the connection from los muertos to quien sabe be make through bonneville and in those troublesome time no one could be trust 
-PRON- could not be know who would overhear conversation carry on over the line 
-PRON- assure magnus that -PRON- would be on hand 
the time for the committee meeting have be set for seven oclock in the evening in order to accommodate lyman who write that -PRON- would be down on the evening train but would be compel by pressure of business to return to the city early the next morning 
at the time appoint the man compose the committee gather about the table in the diningroom of the los muertos ranch house 
-PRON- be almost a reproduction of the scene of the famous evening when osterman have propose the plan of the rancher railroad commission 
magnus derrick sit at the head of the table in -PRON- button frock coat 
whiskey bottle and siphon of sodawater be within easy reach 
presley who by now be consider the confidential friend of every member of the committee lounge as before on the sofa smoking cigarette the cat nathalie on -PRON- knee 
besides magnus and annixter osterman be present and old broderson and harran garnet from the ruby rancho and gething of the san pablo who be also member of the executive committee be on hand preoccupy bearded man smoke black cigar and last of all dabney the silent old man of whom little be know but -PRON- name and who have be make a member of the committee nobody could tell why 
-PRON- son lyman should be here gentleman within at least ten minute 
i have send -PRON- team to meet -PRON- at bonneville explain magnus as -PRON- call the meeting to order

osterman call the roll and to fill in the time read over the minute of the previous meeting 
the treasurer be make -PRON- report as to the fund at the disposal of the league when lyman arrive 
magnus and harran go forward to meet -PRON- and the committee rather awkwardly rise and remain stand while the three exchange greeting the member some of whom have never see -PRON- commissioner eye -PRON- out of the corner of -PRON- eye 
lyman be dress with -PRON- usual correctness 
-PRON- cravat be of the late fashion -PRON- clothe of careful design and unimpeachable fit 
-PRON- shoe of patent leather reflect the lamplight and -PRON- carry a drab overcoat over -PRON- arm 
before be introduce to the committee -PRON- excuse -PRON- a moment and run to see -PRON- mother who wait for -PRON- in the adjoin sittingroom 
but in a few moment -PRON- return ask pardon for the delay 
-PRON- be all affability -PRON- protrude eye that give such an unusual foreign appearance to -PRON- very dark face radiate geniality 
-PRON- be evidently anxious to please to produce a good impression upon the grave clumsy farmer before whom -PRON- stand 
but at the same time presley watch -PRON- from -PRON- place on the sofa could imagine that -PRON- be rather nervous 
-PRON- be too nimble in -PRON- cordiality and the little gesture -PRON- make in bring -PRON- cuff into view and in touch the end of -PRON- tight black mustache with the ball of -PRON- thumb be repeat with unnecessary frequency 
mr broderson -PRON- son lyman -PRON- eld son 
mr annixter -PRON- son lyman 
the governor introduce -PRON- to the rancher proud of good look -PRON- correct dress -PRON- ease of manner 
lyman shake hand all around keep up a flow of small talk find a new phrase for each member complimenting osterman whom -PRON- already know upon -PRON- talent for organisation recall a mutual acquaintance to the mind of old broderson 
at length however -PRON- sit down at the end of the table opposite -PRON- brother 
there be a silence 
magnus rise to recapitulate the reason for the extra session of the committee state again that the board of railway commissioner which succeed in seat have at length issue the new schedule of reduced rate and that mr derrick have be oblige enough to offer to come down to los muertos in person to acquaint the wheatgrower of the san joaquin with the new rate for the carriage of -PRON- grain 
but lyman very politely protest address -PRON- father punctiliously as mr chairman and the other rancher as gentleman of the executive committee of the league 
-PRON- have no wish -PRON- say to disarrange the regular proceeding of the committee 
would -PRON- not be preferable to defer the reading of -PRON- report till new business be call for 
in the meanwhile let the committee proceed with -PRON- usual work 
-PRON- understand the necessarily delicate nature of this work and would be pleased to withdraw till the proper time arrive for -PRON- to speak 
good deal of back and fill about the reading of a column of figure mutter annixter to the man at -PRON- elbow 
lyman await the decision 
-PRON- sit down touch the end of -PRON- mustache 
oh play ball growl annixter 
gething rise to say that as the meeting have be call solely for the purpose of hearing and consider the new grain tariff -PRON- be of the opinion that routine business could be dispense with and the schedule read at once 
-PRON- be so order 
lyman rise and make a long speech 
voluble as osterman -PRON- -PRON- nevertheless have at -PRON- command a vast number of readymade phrase the staple of a political speaker the stock in trade of the commercial lawyer which roll off -PRON- tongue with the most persuasive fluency 
by degree in the course of -PRON- speech -PRON- begin to insinuate the idea that the wheatgrower have never expect to settle -PRON- difficulty with the railroad by the work of a single commission that -PRON- have count upon a long continued campaign of many year railway commission succeed railway commission before the desire low rate should be secure that the present board of commissioner be only the beginning and that too great result be not expect from -PRON- 
all this -PRON- contrive to mention casually in the talk as if -PRON- be a foregone conclusion a matter understand by all 
as the speech continue the eye of the rancher around the table be fix with grow attention upon this welldressed citybre young man who speak so fluently and who tell -PRON- of -PRON- own intention 
a feeling of perplexity begin to spread and the first taint of distrust invade -PRON- mind 
but the good work have be most auspiciously inaugurate continue lyman 
reform so sweeping as the one contemplate can not be accomplish in a single night 
great thing grow slowly benefit to be permanent must accrue gradually 
yet in spite of all this -PRON- commissioner have do much 
already the phalanx of the enemy be pierce already -PRON- armour be dinte 
pledge as be -PRON- commissioner to an average ten per cent reduction in rate for the carriage of grain by the pacific and southwestern railroad -PRON- have rigidly adhere to the demand of -PRON- constituency -PRON- have obey the people 
the main problem have not yet be completely solve that be for later when -PRON- shall have gather sufficient strength to attack the enemy in -PRON- very stronghold -PRON- have make a great advance have take a great step forward and if the work be carry ahead upon the line lay down by the present commissioner and -PRON- constituent there be every reason to believe that within a very few year equitable and stable rate for the shipment of grain from the san joaquin valley to stockton port costa and tidewater will be permanently impose 
well hold on exclaim annixter out of order and ignore the reproof -PRON- commission reduce grain rate in the san joaquin 
-PRON- have reduce grain rate by ten per cent all over the state rejoin lyman 
here be copy of the new schedule 
-PRON- draw -PRON- from -PRON- valise and pass -PRON- around the table 
-PRON- see -PRON- observe the rate between mayfield and oakland for instance have be reduce by twentyfive cent a ton say old broderson -PRON- be rather unusual isnot -PRON- for wheat in that district to be send to oakland 
why look here exclaim annixter look up from the schedule where be there any reduction in rate in the san bonneville and guadalajara for instance 
i donot see as -PRON- have make any reduction at all 
be this right 
do -PRON- give -PRON- the right schedule 
of course the point in the state could not be cover at once return lyman 
-PRON- never expect -PRON- know that -PRON- could cut rate in the san joaquin the very first move that be for later 
but -PRON- will see -PRON- make very material reduction on shipment from the upper sacramento valley also the rate from ione to marysville have be reduce eighty cent a ton 
why rot cry annixter no one ever ship wheat that way 
the salinas rate continue lyman have be lower seventyfive cent the st helena rate fifty cent and please notice the very drastic cut from red bluff north along the oregon route to the oregon state line 
where not a carload of wheat be ship in a year comment gething of the san pablo 
oh -PRON- will find -PRON- mistaken there mr gething return lyman courteously 
and for the matter of that a low rate would stimulate wheatproduction in that district 
the order of the meeting be break up neglect magnu do not even pretend to preside 
in the grow excitement over the inexplicable schedule routine be not think of 
every one speak at will 
why lyman demand magnu look across the table to -PRON- son be this schedule correct 
-PRON- have not cut rate in the san joaquin at all gentleman here and -PRON- -PRON- be no well off than -PRON- be before -PRON- secure -PRON- election as commissioner 
-PRON- be pledge to make an average ten per cent cut sir -PRON- an average ten per cent cut cry osterman 
oh yes that s plain an average ten per cent cut all right but -PRON- have make -PRON- by cut grain rate between point where practically no grain be ship 
-PRON- the wheatgrower in the san joaquin where all the wheat be grow be right where -PRON- be before 
the railroad wonot lose a nickel 
by jingo boy -PRON- glance around the table like to know what this mean 
the railroad if -PRON- come to that return lyman have already lodge a protest against the new rate

ask -PRON- how much -PRON- pay the democratic boss at sacramento to swing the convention 
-PRON- go out slam the door 
presley follow 
the whole affair make -PRON- sick at heart fill -PRON- with infinite disgust infinite weariness 
-PRON- wish to get away from -PRON- all 
-PRON- leave the diningroom and the excited clamouring man behind -PRON- and step out on the porch of the ranch house close the door behind -PRON- 
lyman be nowhere in sight 
presley be alone 
-PRON- be late and after the lampheate air of the diningroom the coolness of the night be delicious and -PRON- vast silence after the noise and fury of the committee meeting descend from the star like a benediction 
presley step to the edge of the porch look off to southward 
and there before -PRON- mile after mile illimitable cover the earth from horizon to horizon lay the wheat 
the growth now many day old be already high from the ground 
there -PRON- lie a vast silent ocean shimmer a pallid green under the moon and under the star a mighty force the strength of nation the life of the world 
there in the night under the dome of the sky -PRON- be grow steadily 
to mind the scene in the room -PRON- have just leave dwindle to paltry insignificance before this sight 
ah yes the be over this that the railroad the rancher the traitor false to -PRON- trust all the member of an obscure conspiracy be wrangle 
as if human agency could affect this colossal power 
what be these heated tiny squabble this feverish small bustle of mankind this minute swarming of the human insect to the great majestic silent ocean of the wheat -PRON- 
indifferent gigantic resistless -PRON- move in -PRON- appoint groove 
man liliputian gnat in the sunshine buzz impudently in -PRON- tiny battle be bear live through -PRON- little day die and be forget while the wheat wrap in nirvanic calm grow steadily under the night alone with the star and with god be a pest that year and presley occasionally find amusement in hunt -PRON- with halfdozen greyhound follow the chase on horseback 
one day between two and three month after lyman visit to los muertos as -PRON- be return toward the ranch house from a distant and lonely quarter of los muerto -PRON- come unexpectedly upon a strange sight 
some twenty man and tenant and small rancher from east of member of the go through the manual of arm under harran supervision 
-PRON- be all equip with new winchester rifle 
harran carry one of these -PRON- and with -PRON- -PRON- illustrate the various command -PRON- give 
as soon as one of the man under -PRON- supervision become more than usually proficient -PRON- be tell off to instruct a file of the more backward 
after the manual of arm harran give the command to take distance as skirmisher and when the line have open out so that some halfdozen foot intervene between each man an advance be make across the field the man stoop low and snap the hammer of -PRON- rifle at an imaginary enemy 
the league have -PRON- agent in san francisco who watch the movement of the railroad as closely as be possible and some time before this annixter have receive word that the marshal and -PRON- deputy be come down to bonneville to put the dummy buyer of -PRON- ranch in possession 
the report prove to be but the first of many false alarm but -PRON- have stimulate the league to unusual activity and some three or four hundred man be furnish with arm and from time to time be drill in secret 
among -PRON- the rancher say that if the railroad manager do not believe -PRON- be terribly in earnest in the stand -PRON- have take -PRON- be make a fatal mistake 
harran reassert this statement to presley on the way home to the ranch house that same day 
harran have catch up with -PRON- by the time -PRON- reach the low road and the two jog homeward through the mile of stand wheat 
-PRON- may jump the ranch pre -PRON- say if -PRON- try hard enough but -PRON- will never do -PRON- while i be alive 
by the way -PRON- add -PRON- know -PRON- serve notice yesterday upon behrman and cy 
ruggle to quit the country 
of course -PRON- wonot do -PRON- but -PRON- wonot be able to say -PRON- didnot have warning 
about an hour later the two reach the ranch house but as harran ride up the driveway -PRON- utter an exclamation 
hello -PRON- say something be up buckboard 
in fact the editor team be tie underneath the shade of a giant eucalyptus tree near by 
harran uneasy under this unexpected visit of the enemys friend dismount without stable -PRON- horse and go at once to the diningroom where visitor be invariably receive 
but the diningroom be empty and -PRON- mother tell -PRON- that magnus and the editor be in the office 
magnus have say -PRON- be not to be disturb 
earlier in the afternoon the editor have drive up to the porch and have ask mrs derrick whom -PRON- find read a book of poem on the porch if -PRON- could see magnus 
at the time the governor have go with phelp to inspect the condition of the young wheat on hold but within half an hour -PRON- return and genslinger have ask -PRON- for a few moment talk in private 
the two go into the office magnus lock the door behind -PRON- 
very complete -PRON- be here governor observe the editor in -PRON- alert jerky manner -PRON- black beadlike eye twinkle around the room from behind -PRON- glass 
telephone safe ticker accountbookswell that s progress isnot -PRON- 
only way to manage a big ranch these day 
but the day of the big ranch be over 
as the land appreciate in value the temptation to sell off small holding will be too strong 
and then the small holding can be cultivate to well advantage 
i shall have an editorial on that some day 
the cost of maintain a number of small holding say magnus indifferently be of course great than if -PRON- be all under one management 
that may be that may be rejoin the other 
there be a long pause 
genslinger lean back in -PRON- chair and rub a knee 
magnus stand erect in front of the safe wait for -PRON- to speak 
this be an unfortunate business governor begin the editor this misunderstanding between the rancher and the railroad 
i wish -PRON- could be adjust be two industry that be in harmony with one another or -PRON- all go to pot should prefer not to be interview on the subject mr genslinger say magnus 
oh no oh no 
lord love -PRON- governor i donot want to interview -PRON- 
-PRON- all know how -PRON- stand 
again there be a long silence 
magnus wonder what this little man usually so garrulous could want of -PRON- 
at length genslinger begin again 
-PRON- do not look at magnu except at long interval 
about the present railroad commission -PRON- remark 
that be an interesting campaign -PRON- conduct in sacramento and san francisco 
magnus hold -PRON- peace -PRON- hand shut tight 
do genslinger know of disgrace 
be -PRON- for this -PRON- have come 
would the story of -PRON- be the lead article in mercury 
an interesting campaign repeat genslinger slowly a very interesting campaign 
i watch -PRON- with every degree of interest 
i see -PRON- every phase mr derrick 
the campaign be not without -PRON- interest admit magnus 
yes say genslinger still more deliberately and some phase of -PRON- interesting than other as for instance let -PRON- say the way in which the vote of certain chairman of i particularise further 
yes those way -PRON- get -PRON- vote 
now i should say mr derrick be the most interesting move in the whole -PRON- 
hm curious -PRON- murmur musingly see 
-PRON- deposit two onethousand dollar bill and four fivehundre dollar bill in a hundred and eight be the a box in the safety deposit vault in san francisco and see -PRON- give a key to this box to each of the gentleman in question and after the election the box be empty 
now i call that interestingcurious because -PRON- a new safe and highly ingenious method of bribery 
how do -PRON- happen to think of -PRON- governor 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- be do sir 
magnus burst forth 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- be insinuate here in -PRON- own house 
why governor return the editor blandly not anything talk about what i a lie 
genslinger rub -PRON- chin reflectively 
well -PRON- answer -PRON- can have a chance to prove -PRON- before the grand jury if -PRON- want to 
-PRON- character be know all over the state bluster magnus 
-PRON- politic be pure politic 
-PRON- no one need a well reputation for pure politic than the man who set out to be a briber interrupt genslinger and i may as well tell -PRON- governor that -PRON- canot shout -PRON- down 
i can put -PRON- hand on the two chairman -PRON- buy before -PRON- dark today have -PRON- deposition in -PRON- safe for the last six week 
-PRON- could make the arrest tomorrow if -PRON- want 
governor -PRON- sure do a risky thing when -PRON- go into that sacramento fight an awful risky thing 
some man can afford to have bribery charge prefer against -PRON- and -PRON- donot hurt one little bit but -PRON- would -PRON- governor bust -PRON- dead 
i know all about the whole shananigan business from a to and if -PRON- donot believe ithere -PRON- draw a long strip of paper from -PRON- pocket a galley proof of the story 
magnus take -PRON- in -PRON- hand 
there under -PRON- eye scareheade doubleleade the more important clause print in bold type be the detailed account of the deal magnus have make with the two delegate 
-PRON- be pitiless remorseless bald 
every statement be substantiate every statistic verify with meticulous love for exactness 
besides all that -PRON- have the ring of truth 
-PRON- be exposure ruin absolute annihilation about correct isnot -PRON- comment genslinger as derrick finish read 
magnus do not reply think -PRON- be correct enough the editor continue 
but i think -PRON- would only be fair to -PRON- to let -PRON- see -PRON- before -PRON- be publish 
the one thought uppermost in mind -PRON- one impulse of the moment be at whatever cost to preserve -PRON- dignity not to allow this man to exult in the sight of one quiver of weakness one trace of defeat one suggestion of humiliation 
by an effort that put all -PRON- iron rigidity to the test -PRON- force -PRON- to look straight into eye congratulate -PRON- -PRON- observe hand back the proof upon -PRON- journalistic enterprise 
-PRON- paper will sell tomorrow 
oh i donot know as i want to publish this story remark the editor indifferently put away the galley just like that 
the fun for -PRON- be run a good story to earth but once get -PRON- i lose interest 
and then i wouldnot like to see the position -PRON- do president of the league and a lead man of the wouldnot like to see a story like this smash -PRON- over worth more to -PRON- to keep -PRON- out of print than for -PRON- to put -PRON- in get nothing much to gain but a few extra edition but -PRON- would lose everything 
-PRON- committee be in the deal right enough 
but -PRON- league all the san joaquin valley everybody in the state believe the commissioner be fairly elect 
-PRON- story suddenly exclaim magnus strike with an idea will be thoroughly discredit just so soon as the new grain tariff be publish 
i have mean of know that the san joaquin issue upon which the board be not to be touch 
be -PRON- likely the rancher would secure the election of a board that play -PRON- false 
oh -PRON- know all about that answer genslinger smile 
-PRON- think -PRON- be elect lyman easily 
-PRON- think -PRON- have get the railroad to walk right into -PRON- trap 
-PRON- didnot understand how -PRON- could pull off -PRON- deal so easily 
why governor -PRON- be man the corporation want for commissioner 
and -PRON- people elect the railroad all the trouble of campaign for -PRON- 
and -PRON- canot make any counter charge of bribery there 
no sir the corporation donot use such amateurish method as that 
confidentially and between -PRON- two all that the railroad have do for lyman in order to attach -PRON- to -PRON- interest be to promise to back -PRON- politically in the next campaign for governor too bad -PRON- continue drop -PRON- voice and change -PRON- position 
-PRON- really be too bad to see good man try to bunt a stone wall over with -PRON- bare head 
-PRON- couldnot have win at any stage of the game 
i wish i could have talk to -PRON- and -PRON- friend before -PRON- go into that sacramento fight 
i could have tell -PRON- then how little chance -PRON- have 
when will -PRON- people realise that -PRON- canot buck against the railroad 
why magnus -PRON- like -PRON- go out in a paper boat and shoot pea at a battleship 
be that all -PRON- wish to see -PRON- about mr genslinger remark magnus bestir -PRON- be rather occupied today 
well return the other -PRON- know what the publication of this article would mean for -PRON- 
-PRON- pause again take off -PRON- glass breathe on -PRON- polish the lense with -PRON- handkerchief and readjust -PRON- on -PRON- nose be think governor -PRON- begin again with renew alertness and quite irrelevantly of enlarge the scope of the mercury 
-PRON- see midway between the two big centre of the state san francisco and los angele and i want to extend the sphere of influence as far up and down the valley as i can 
i want to illustrate the paper 
-PRON- see if i have a photoengrave plant of -PRON- own i could do a good deal of outside job as well and the investment would pay ten per cent 
but -PRON- take money to make money 
i wouldnot want to put in any dinky onehorse affair 
i want a good plant be figure out the business 
besides the plant there would be the expense of a high grade paper print halftone on anything but coated paper and that well what with this and with that and run expense till the thing begin to pay -PRON- would cost -PRON- about ten thousand dollar and i be wonder if perhaps -PRON- couldnot see -PRON- way clear to accommodate -PRON- 
ten thousand 
yes 
say five thousand down and the balance within sixty day 
magnus for the moment blind to what genslinger have in mind turn on -PRON- in astonishment 
why man what security could -PRON- give -PRON- for such an amount 
well to tell the truth answer the editor hadnot think much about security 
in fact i believe -PRON- would see how greatly -PRON- be to -PRON- advantage to talk business with -PRON- 
-PRON- see not go to print this article about -PRON- governor and not go to let -PRON- get out so as any one else can print -PRON- and -PRON- seem to -PRON- that one good turn deserve another 
-PRON- understand 
magnus understand 
an overwhelming desire suddenly take possession of -PRON- to grip this blackmailer by the throat to strangle -PRON- where -PRON- stand or if not at least to turn upon -PRON- with that oldtime terrible anger before which whole convention have once cower 
but in the same moment the governor realise this be not to be 
only -PRON- righteousness have make -PRON- wrath terrible only the justice of -PRON- anger have make -PRON- fear 
now the foundation be go from under -PRON- foot -PRON- have knock -PRON- away -PRON- 
three time feeble be -PRON- whose quarrel be unjust 
before this country editor this pay speaker of the railroad -PRON- stand convict 
the man have -PRON- at -PRON- mercy 
the detect briber could not resent an insult 
genslinger rise smooth -PRON- hat 
well -PRON- say of course -PRON- want time to think -PRON- over and -PRON- canot raise money like that on short notice wait till friday noon of this week 
-PRON- begin to set paper at about four friday afternoon and the form be lock about two in the morning 
i hope -PRON- add turn back at the door of the room that -PRON- wonot find anything disagreeable in -PRON- saturday morning mercury mr derrick 
-PRON- go out close the door behind -PRON- and in a moment magnus hear the wheel of -PRON- buckboard grating on the driveway 
the follow morning bring a letter to magnus from gething of the san pueblo ranch which be situate very close to visalia 
the letter be to the effect that all around visalia upon the ranch affect by the regrade of the railroad man be arm and drilling and that the strength of the league in that quarter be undoubted 
but to refer continue the letter to a most painful recollection 
-PRON- will no doubt remember that at the close of -PRON- last committee meeting specific charge be make as to fraud in the nomination and election of one of -PRON- commissioner emanate most unfortunately from the commissioner -PRON- 
these charge -PRON- dear mr derrick be direct at -PRON- 
how the secret of the committee have be noise about i can not understand 
-PRON- may be of course assure of -PRON- own unquestioning confidence and loyalty 
however i regret exceedingly to state not only that the rumour of the charge refer to above be spread in this district but that also -PRON- be make use of by the enemy of the league 
-PRON- be to be deplore that some of the leaguer know -PRON- number in -PRON- rank many small farmer ignorant portuguese and listen to these story and have permit a feeling of uneasiness to develop among -PRON- 
even though -PRON- be admit that fraudulent mean have be employ in the election which of course i personally do not admit i do not think -PRON- would make very much difference in the confidence which the vast majority of the leaguer repose in -PRON- chief 
yet -PRON- have so insist upon the probity of -PRON- position as oppose to railroad chicanery that i believe -PRON- advisable to quell this distant suspicion at once to publish a denial of these rumour charge would only be to give -PRON- too much importance 
however can -PRON- not write -PRON- a letter state exactly how the campaign be conduct and the commission nominate and elect 
i could show this to some of the more disaffect and -PRON- would serve to allay all suspicion on the instant 
i think -PRON- would be well to write as though the initiative come not from -PRON- but from -PRON- ignore this present letter 
i offer this only as a suggestion and will confidently endorse any decision -PRON- may arrive at 
the letter close with renew protestation of confidence 
magnus be alone when -PRON- read this 
-PRON- put -PRON- carefully away in the filing cabinet in -PRON- office and wipe the sweat from -PRON- forehead and face 
-PRON- stand for one moment -PRON- hand rigid at -PRON- side -PRON- fist clinch 
this be pile up -PRON- mutter look blankly at the opposite wall 
-PRON- god this be pile up 
what be i to do 
ah the bitterness of unavaile regret the anguish of compromise with conscience the remorse of a bad deed do in a moment of excitement 
ah the humiliation of detection the degradation of be catch catch like a schoolboy pilfer -PRON- fellow desk and bad than all bad than all the consciousness of lose selfrespect the knowledge of a prestige vanish a dignity impair knowledge that the grip which hold a multitude in check be tremble that control be waver that command be be weaken 
then the little trick to deceive the crowd the little subterfuge the little pretence that keep up appearance the lie the bluster the pose the strut the gasconade where once be iron authority the turning of the head so as not to see that which could not be prevent the suspicion of suspicion the haunting fear of the man on the street the uneasiness of the direct glance the questioning as to have this be say what be mean by that word that gesture that glance 
wednesday pass and thursday 
magnus keep to -PRON- see no visitor avoid even -PRON- family 
how to break through the mesh of the net how to regain the old position how to prevent discovery 
if there be only some way some vast superhuman effort by which -PRON- could rise in -PRON- old strength once more crush lyman with one hand genslinger with the other and for one more moment the last to stand supreme again indomitable the leader then go to -PRON- death triumphant at the end -PRON- memory untarnishe -PRON- fame undimmed 
but the plaguespot be in -PRON- knit forever into the fabric of -PRON- being 
though genslinger should be silence though lyman should be crush though even the league should overcome the railroad though -PRON- should be the acknowledge leader of a resplendent victory yet the plaguespot would remain 
there be no success for -PRON- now 
however conspicuous the outward achievement -PRON- -PRON- -PRON- magnu derrick have fail miserably and irredeemably 
petty material complication intrude sordid consideration 
even if genslinger be to be pay where be the money to come from 
-PRON- legal battle with the railroad extend now over a period of many year have cost -PRON- dear -PRON- plan of sow all of los muertos to wheat discharge the tenant have prove expensive the campaign result in election have draw heavily upon -PRON- account 
all along -PRON- have be rely upon a bonanza crop to reimburse -PRON- 
-PRON- be not believable that the railroad would jump los muertos but if this should happen -PRON- would be leave without resource

-PRON- be grey with dust -PRON- nose be to the ground 
at the gate where dyke have turn into the ranch house ground -PRON- halt in confusion a moment 
one start to follow the highwayman trail towards the stable corral but the other quarter over the road with lightning swiftness suddenly pick up the new scent lead on towards guadalajara

-PRON- have see everything and have understand 
-PRON- say nothing 
-PRON- head incline towards the roadway -PRON- listen to the faint and distant baying of the dog 
dyke thunder across the railway track by the depot at guadalajara not five minute ahead of -PRON- pursuer 
luck seem to have desert -PRON- 
the station usually so quiet be now occupy by the crew of a freight train that lie on the down track while on the up line near at hand and head in the same direction be a detached locomotive whose engineer and fireman recognize -PRON- -PRON- be sure as the buckskin leap across the rail 
-PRON- have have no time to formulate a plan since that morning when torture with thirst -PRON- have venture near the spring at the headwater of broderson creek on quien sabe and have all but fall into the hand of the posse that have be watch for that very move 
-PRON- be useless now to regret that -PRON- have try to foil pursuit by turn back on -PRON- track to regain the mountain east of bonneville 
now delaney be almost on -PRON- 
to distance that posse be the only thing to be think of now 
-PRON- be no longer a question of hide till pursuit should flag -PRON- have drive -PRON- out from the shelter of the mountain down into this populous countryside where an enemy may be meet with at every turn of the road 
now -PRON- be life or death 
-PRON- would either escape or be kill 
-PRON- know very well that -PRON- would never allow -PRON- to be take alive 
but -PRON- have no mind to be turn and escape be block 
-PRON- one thought be to leave pursuit behind 
week of flight have sharpen every sense 
as -PRON- turn into the upper road beyond guadalajara -PRON- see the three man gallop down from stock range make for the road ahead of -PRON- 
-PRON- would cut -PRON- off there 
-PRON- swing the buckskin about 
-PRON- must take the low road across los muertos from guadalajara and -PRON- must reach -PRON- before dog and posse 
back -PRON- gallop the buckskin measure -PRON- length with every leap 
once more the station come in sight 
rise in -PRON- stirrup -PRON- look across the field in the direction of the low road 
there be a cloud of dust there 
from a wagon 
no horse on the run and -PRON- rider be armed 
-PRON- could catch the flash of gun barrel 
-PRON- be all close in on -PRON- converge on guadalajara by every available road 
the upper road west of guadalajara lead straight to bonneville 
that way be impossible 
be -PRON- in a trap 
have the time for fighting come at last 
but as dyke near the depot at guadalajara -PRON- eye fall upon the detached locomotive that lie quietly steam on the up line and with a thrill of exultation -PRON- remember that -PRON- be an engineer bear and breed dog be already to be hear and the roll of hoof on the low road be din in -PRON- ear as -PRON- leap from the buckskin before the depot 
the train crew scatter like frightened sheep before -PRON- but dyke ignore -PRON- 
-PRON- pistol be in -PRON- hand as once more on foot -PRON- spring toward the lone engine 
out of the cab -PRON- shout 
both of -PRON- 
quick or kill -PRON- both 
the two man tumble from the iron apron of the tender as dyke swing -PRON- up drop -PRON- pistol on the floor of the cab and reach with the old instinct for the familiar lever 
the great compound hiss and tremble as the steam be release and the huge driver stir turn slowly on the track 
but there be a shout posse dog and man swing into view at the turn of the road -PRON- figure lean over as -PRON- take the curve at full speed 
dyke throw everything wide open and catch up -PRON- revolver 
from behind come the challenge of a winchester 
the party on the low road be even close than delaney 
-PRON- have see -PRON- manoeuvre and the first shot of the fight shiver the cab window above the engineer head 
but spin futilely at first the driver of the engine at last catch the rail 
the engine move advanced travel past the depot and the freight train and gather speed roll out on the track beyond 
smoke black and boiling shoot skyward from the stack not a joint that do not shudder with the mighty strain of the steam but the great iron of new and to call obedient and docile as soon as ever the great pulsing heart of -PRON- feel a master hand upon -PRON- lever 
-PRON- gather -PRON- speed brace -PRON- steel muscle -PRON- thew of iron and roar out upon the open track fill the air with the rasp of -PRON- tempestbreath blot the sunshine with the belch of -PRON- hot thick smoke 
already -PRON- be lessen in the distance when delaney christian and the sheriff of visalia dash up to the station 
the posse have see everything 
stick 
curse the luck vociferate the but the sheriff be already out of the saddle and into the telegraph office a derailing switch between here and pixley isnot there -PRON- cry 
yes 
wire ahead to open -PRON- derail -PRON- there 
come on -PRON- turn to delaney and the other 
-PRON- spring into the cab of the locomotive that be attach to the freight train 
name of the state of california shout the sheriff to the bewilder engineer 
cut off from -PRON- train 
the sheriff be a man to be obey without hesitate 
time be not allow the crew of the freight train for debate as to the right or the wrong of requisition the engine and before anyone think of the safety or danger of the affair the freight engine be already fly out upon the down line hot in pursuit of dyke now far ahead upon the up track remember perfectly well there s a derailing switch between here and pixley shout the sheriff above the roar of the locomotive 
-PRON- use -PRON- in case -PRON- have to derail runaway engine 
-PRON- run right off into the country pile -PRON- up there 
ready with -PRON- gun boy 
if -PRON- should meet another train come up on this track protest the frightened engineer 
then -PRON- would jump or be smash 
hi look 
there -PRON- be 
as the freight engine round a curve engine come into view shooting on some quarter of a mile ahead of -PRON- wreathe in whirl smoke 
the switch ainot much further on clamour the engineer 
-PRON- can see pixley now 
dyke -PRON- hand on the grip of the valve that control the steam -PRON- head out of the cab window thunder on 
-PRON- be back in -PRON- old place again once more -PRON- be the engineer once more -PRON- feel the engine quiver under -PRON- the familiar noise be in -PRON- ear the familiar buffeting of the wind surge roar at -PRON- face the familiar odour of hot steam and smoke reek in -PRON- nostril and on either side of -PRON- parallel panorama the two half of the landscape slice as -PRON- be in two by the clash wheel of -PRON- engine stream by in green and brown blur 
-PRON- find -PRON- settle to the old position on the cab seat lean on -PRON- elbow from the window one hand on the controller 
all at once the instinct of the pursuit that of late have become so strong within -PRON- prompt -PRON- to shoot a glance behind 
-PRON- see the other engine on the down line plunge after -PRON- rock from side to side with the fury of -PRON- gallop 
not yet have -PRON- shake the tracker from -PRON- heel not yet be -PRON- out of the reach of danger 
-PRON- set -PRON- tooth and throw open the firedoor stoke vigorously for a few moment 
the indicator of the steam gauge rise -PRON- speed increase a glance at the telegraph pole tell -PRON- -PRON- be do -PRON- fifty mile an hour 
the freight engine behind -PRON- be never build for that pace 
bar the terrible risk of accident -PRON- chance be good 
but engineer dominate the shut off -PRON- steam and throw back -PRON- brake to the extreme notch 
directly ahead of -PRON- rise a semaphore place at a point where evidently a derailing switch branch from the line 
the semaphore arm be drop over the track set the danger signal that show the switch be open 
in an instant dyke see the trick 
-PRON- have mean to smash -PRON- here have be clever enough quickwitte enough to open the switch but have forget the automatic semaphore that work simultaneously with the movement of the rail 
to go forward be certain destruction 
dyke reversed 
there be nothing for -PRON- but to go back 
with a wrench and a spasm of all -PRON- metal fibre the great compound brace -PRON- slide with rigid wheel along the rail 
then as dyke apply the reverse -PRON- draw back from the great danger return towards the less 
inevitably now the two engine one on the up the other on the down line must meet and pass each other 
dyke release the lever reach for -PRON- revolver 
the engineer once more become the highwayman in peril of -PRON- life 
now beyond all doubt the time for fighting be at hand

behrman jolt along far in the rear 
and even then harry through an open country where there be no place to hide -PRON- be a matter of amazement how long a chase the highwayman lead -PRON- 
fence be pass fence whose barbed wire have be slash apart by the fugitive knife 
the ground rise under foot the hill be at hand still the pursuit hold on 
the sun long past the meridian begin to turn earthward 
would night come on before -PRON- be up with -PRON- 
look 
look 
there -PRON- be 
quick there -PRON- go 
high on the bare slope of the near hill all the posse look in the direction of gesture see the figure of a horseman emerge from an arroyo fill with chaparral and struggle at a labouring gallop straight up the slope 
suddenly every member of the party shout aloud 
the horse have fall pitch the rider from the saddle 
the man rise to -PRON- foot catch at the bridle miss -PRON- and the horse dash on alone 
the man pause for a second look around see the chase draw nearer then turn back disappear in the chaparral 
delaney raise a great whoop get -PRON- now 
into the slope and valley of the hill dash the band of horseman the trail now so fresh that -PRON- could be easily discern by all 
on and on -PRON- lead -PRON- a furious wild scramble straight up the slope 
the minute go by 
the dry bed of a rivulet be pass then another fence then a tangle of manzanita a meadow of wild oat full of agitated cattle then an arroyo thick with chaparral and scrub oak and then without warn the pistol shot rip out and run from rider to rider with the rapidity of a gatle discharge and one of the deputy bend forward in the saddle both hand to -PRON- face the blood jet from between -PRON- finger 
dyke be there at bay at last -PRON- back against a bank of rock the root of a fallen tree serve -PRON- as a rampart -PRON- revolver smoking in -PRON- hand under arrest dyke cry the sheriff not the least use to fight 
the whole country be up 
dyke fire again the shot splinter the foreleg of the horse the sheriff ride 
the posse four man all wound deputy have crawl out of the fight after first back after the preliminary fusillade dismount and take shelter behind rock and tree 
on that rugged ground fight from the saddle be impracticable 
dyke in the meanwhile hold -PRON- fire for -PRON- know that once -PRON- pistol be empty -PRON- would never be allow time to reload 
dyke call the sheriff again for the last time i summon -PRON- to surrender 
dyke do not reply 
the sheriff delaney and the man name christian confer together in a low voice 
then delaney and christian leave the other make a wide detour up the side of the arroyo to gain a position to the left and somewhat to the rear of dyke 
but -PRON- be at this moment that behrman arrive 
-PRON- could not be say whether -PRON- be courage or carelessness that bring the agent within reach of revolver 
possibly -PRON- be really a brave man possibly occupy with keep an uncertain seat upon the back of -PRON- labouring scrambling horse -PRON- have not notice that -PRON- be so close upon that scene of battle 
-PRON- certainly do not observe the posse lie upon the ground behind shelter rock and tree and before anyone could call a warning -PRON- have ride out into the open within thirty pace of intrenchment 
dyke see 
there be the archenemy the man of all man whom -PRON- most hate the man who have ruin -PRON- who have exasperate -PRON- and drive -PRON- to crime and who have instigate tireless pursuit through all those past terrible week 
suddenly invite death -PRON- leap up and forward -PRON- have forget all else all other consideration at the sight of this man 
-PRON- would die gladly so only that behrman die before -PRON- get anyway -PRON- shout as -PRON- run forward 
the muzzle of the weapon be not ten foot from huge stomach as dyke draw the trigger 
have the cartridge explode death certain and swift would have follow but at this of all moment the revolver miss fire 
behrman with an unexpected agility leap from the saddle and keep -PRON- horse between -PRON- and dyke run dodge and duck from tree to tree 
-PRON- first shoot a failure dyke fire again and again at -PRON- enemy empty -PRON- revolver reckless of consequence 
-PRON- every shot go wild and before -PRON- could draw -PRON- knife the whole posse be upon -PRON- 
without concerted plan obey no signal but the prompting of the impulse that snatch unerre at man delaney and christian from one side the sheriff and the deputy from the other rush in 
-PRON- do not fire 
-PRON- be dyke alive -PRON- want 
one of -PRON- have a riata snatch from a saddlepommel and with this -PRON- try to bind -PRON- 
the fight be four to man with law on -PRON- side to one wound freebooter halfstarve exhaust by day and night of pursuit wear down with loss of sleep thirst privation and the grind nerveracke consciousness of an everpresent peril 
-PRON- swarm upon -PRON- from all side grip at -PRON- leg at -PRON- arm -PRON- throat -PRON- head strike clutch kick fall to the ground roll over and over now under now above now stagger forward now topple back

now -PRON- be down pin under two man across -PRON- leg and now halfway up again struggle to one knee 
then upright again with half -PRON- enemy hang on -PRON- back 
-PRON- colossal strength seem double when -PRON- arm be hold -PRON- fight bulllike with -PRON- head 
a score of time -PRON- seem as if -PRON- be about to secure -PRON- finally and irrevocably and then -PRON- would free an arm a leg a shoulder and the group that for the fraction of an instant have settle lock and rigid on -PRON- prey would break up again as -PRON- fling a man from -PRON- reel and bloody and -PRON- -PRON- twist squirm dodge -PRON- great fist work like piston back away drag and carry the other with -PRON- 
more than once -PRON- loosen almost every grip and for an instant stand nearly free pant roll -PRON- eye -PRON- clothe tear from -PRON- body bleeding drip with sweat a terrible figure nearly free 
the sheriff under -PRON- breath utter an exclamation by god hell get away yet 
behrman watch the fight complacently 
that all may show obstinacy -PRON- comment but -PRON- donot show common sense 
yet however dyke may throw off the clutch and fetter embrace that encircle -PRON- however -PRON- may disintegrate and scatter the band of foe that heap -PRON- upon -PRON- however -PRON- may gain one instant of comparative liberty some one of -PRON- assailant always hang doggedly blindly to an arm a leg or a foot and the other draw a second breath close in again implacable unconquerable ferocious like hound upon a wolf 
at length two of the man manage to bring wrist close enough together to allow the sheriff to snap the handcuff on 
even then dyke clasp -PRON- hand and use the handcuff -PRON- as a weapon knock down delaney by the crush impact of the steel bracelet upon the forehead 
but -PRON- could no longer protect -PRON- from attack from behind and the riata be finally pass around -PRON- body pinion -PRON- arm to -PRON- side 
after this -PRON- be useless to resist 
the wound deputy sit with -PRON- back to a rock hold -PRON- break jaw in both hand 
the sheriff horse with -PRON- splintered foreleg would have to be shoot head be cut from temple to cheekbone

-PRON- sit -PRON- on the buckskin behrman support -PRON- the sheriff on foot lead the horse by the bridle 
the little procession form and descend from the hill turn in the direction of bonneville 
a special train one car and an engine would be make up there and the highwayman would sleep in the visalia jail that night 
delaney and behrman find -PRON- in the rear of the cavalcade as -PRON- move off 
the cowpuncher turn to -PRON- chief well captain -PRON- say still pant as -PRON- bind up -PRON- forehead -PRON-

like a gigantic carpet -PRON- spread -PRON- over all the land 
there be nothing else to be see but the limitless sea of wheat as far as the eye could reach dry rustle crisp and harsh in the rare breath of hot wind out of the southeast

the time when this thought of another should broaden and widen into thought of be yet to come but already -PRON- have expand to include the unborn childalready as in the case of mrs dyke -PRON- have broaden to enfold another child and another mother bind to -PRON- by no tie other than those of humanity and pity 
in time start from this point -PRON- would reach out more and more till -PRON- should take in all man and all woman and the intolerant selfish man while retain all of -PRON- native strength should become tolerant and generous kind and forgiving 
for the moment however the two nature struggle within -PRON- 
a fight be to be fight one more the last the fiercest the attack of the enemy who menace -PRON- very home and hearth be to be resist 
then peace attain arrest development would once more proceed 
hilma look from the carryall scan the open plain in front of the advance line of the drive 
where be the rabbit -PRON- ask of annixter donot see any at all 
-PRON- be way ahead of -PRON- yet -PRON- say 
here take the glass 
-PRON- pass -PRON- -PRON- field glass and -PRON- adjust -PRON- 
oh yes -PRON- cry see 
i can see five or six but oh so far off 
the beggar run way ahead at first should say so 
see -PRON- speck 
every now and then -PRON- sit up -PRON- ear straight up in the air 
here look hilma there go one close by 
from out of the ground apparently some twenty yard distant a great jack spring into view bound away with tremendous leap -PRON- blacktippe ear erect 
-PRON- disappear -PRON- grey body lose -PRON- against the grey of the ground 
oh a big fellow 
hi yonder another 
yes yes oh look at -PRON- run 
from off the surface of the ground at first apparently empty of all life and seemingly unable to afford hiding place for so much as a fieldmouse jackrabbit start up at every moment as the line go forward 
at first -PRON- appear singly and at long interval then in two and three as the drive continue to advance 
-PRON- leap across the plain and stop in the distance sit up with straight ear then run on again be join by other sink down flush to the ear flatten start up again run to the side turn back once more dart away with incredible swiftness and be lose to view only to be replace by a score of other 
gradually the number of jack to be see over the expanse of stubble in front of the line of team increase 
-PRON- antic be infinite 
no two act precisely alike 
some lie stubbornly close in a little depression between two clod till the horse hoof be all but upon -PRON- then spring out from -PRON- hidingplace at the last second 
other run forward but a few yard at a time refuse to take flight scent a great danger before -PRON- than behind 
still other force up at the last moment double with lightning alacrity in -PRON- track turn back to scuttle between the team take desperate chance 
as often as this occur -PRON- be the signal for a great uproar let -PRON- get through don let -PRON- get through 
look out for -PRON- there -PRON- go 
horn be blow bell ring tin pan clamorously beat 
either the jack escape or confuse by the noise dart back again flee away as if -PRON- life depend on the issue of the instant 
once even a bewilder rabbit jump fair into mrs lap as -PRON- sit in the carryall and be out again like a flash 
poor frightened thing -PRON- exclaim and for a long time afterward -PRON- retain upon -PRON- knee the sensation of the four little paw quiver with excitement and the feel of the tremble furry body with -PRON- wildly beat heart press against -PRON- own 
by noon the number of rabbit discernible by field glass on ahead be far into the thousand 
what seem to be ground resolve -PRON- when see through the glass into a maze of small move body leap duck double run back and wilderness of agitated ear white tail and twinkling leg 
the outside wing of the curve line of vehicle begin to draw in a little ranch be leave behind the drive continue on over quien sabe 
as the day advance the rabbit singularly enough become less wild 
when flush -PRON- no longer run so far nor so fast limp off instead a few foot at a time and crouch down -PRON- ear close upon -PRON- back 
thus -PRON- be that by degree the team begin to close up on the main herd 
at every instant the number increase 
-PRON- be no longer thousand -PRON- be ten of thousand 
the earth be alive with rabbit 
denser and denser grow the throng 
in all direction nothing be to be see but the loose mass of the move jack 
the horn of the crescent of team begin to contract 
far off the corral come into sight 
the disintegrate mass of rabbit commence as -PRON- be to solidify to coagulate 
at first each jack be some three foot distant from -PRON- near neighbor but this space diminish to two foot then to one then to but a few inch 
the rabbit begin leap over one another 
then the strange scene define -PRON- 
-PRON- be no longer a herd cover the earth 
-PRON- be a sea whip into confusion toss incessantly leap fall agitate by unseen force 
at time the unexpected tameness of the rabbit all at once vanish 
throughout certain portion of the herd eddy of terror abruptly burst forth 
a panic spread then there would ensue a blind wild rush together of thousand of crowded body and a furious scrambling over back till the scuffing thud of innumerable foot over the earth rise to a reverberate murmur as of distant thunder here and there pierce by the strange wild cry of the rabbit in distress 
the line of vehicle be halt 
to go forward now mean to trample the rabbit under foot 
the drive come to a standstill while the herd enter the corral 
this take time for the rabbit be by now too crowded to run 
however like an open sluicegate the extend flank of the entrance of the corral slowly engulf the herd 
the mass pack tight as ever by degree diminish precisely as a pool of water when a dam be open 
the last straggler go in with a rush and the gate be drop 
come just have a lock in here call annixter 
hilma descend from the carryall and join by presley and harran approach and look over the high board fence 
oh do -PRON- ever see anything like that -PRON- exclaim 
the corral a really large enclosure have prove all too small for the number of rabbit collect by the drive 
inside -PRON- be a living move leap breathing twist mass 
the rabbit be pack two three and four foot deep 
-PRON- be in constant movement those beneath struggle to the top those on top sinking and disappear below -PRON- fellow 
all wildness all fear of man seem to have entirely disappear 
man and boy reach over the side of the corral pick up a jack in each hand hold -PRON- by the ear while two reporter from san francisco paper take photograph of the scene 
the noise make by the ten of thousand of move body be as the noise of wind in a forest while from the hot and sweating mass there rise a strange odor penetrate ammoniacal savouring of wild life 
on signal the killing begin 
dog that have be bring there for that purpose when let into the corral refuse as have be half expect to do the work 
-PRON- snuff curiously at the pile then back off disturb perplexed 
but the man and for the most more eager 
annixter draw hilma away and indeed most of the people set about the barbecue at once 
in the corral however the killing go forward 
arm with a club in each hand the young fellow from guadalajara and bonneville and the farm boy from the ranch leap over the rail of the corral 
-PRON- walk unsteadily upon the myriad of crowd body underfoot or as space be clear sink almost waist deep into the mass that leap and squirm about -PRON- 
blindly furiously -PRON- strike and strike 
the anglosaxon spectator round about draw back in disgust but the hot degenerated blood of portuguese mexican and mixed spaniard boil up in excitement at this wholesale slaughter 
but only a few of the participant of the drive care to look on 
all the guest betake -PRON- some quarter of a mile farther on into the hill 
the picnic and barbecue be to be hold around the spring where broderson creek take -PRON- rise 
already two entire beef be roast there team be hitch saddle remove and man woman and child a great throng spread out under the shade of the live oak 
a vast confused clamour rise in the air a babel of talk a clatter of tin plate of knife and fork 
bottle be uncorked napkin and oilcloth spread over the ground 
the man light pipe and cigar the woman seize the occasion to nurse -PRON- baby 
osterman ubiquitous as ever resplendent in -PRON- boot and english riding breech move about between the group keep up an endless flow of talk crack joke wink nudge gesture put -PRON- tongue in -PRON- cheek never at a loss for a reply play the goat 
that josher osterman always at -PRON- monkeyshine but a good fellow for all that brainy too

hilma hasten to put forward a huge china platter 
osterman have a joke to crack with the two boy a joke that be rather broad but as -PRON- turn about the word almost on -PRON- lip -PRON- glance fall upon hilma -PRON- whom -PRON- have not see for more than two month 
-PRON- have hand presley the platter and be now sit with -PRON- back against the tree between two bole of the root

-PRON- sit thus as on a throne raise above the rest the radiance of the unseen crown of motherhood glow from -PRON- forehead the beauty of the perfect woman surround -PRON- like a glory 
and the josh die away on lip and unconsciously and swiftly -PRON- bare -PRON- head 
something be pass there in the air about -PRON- that -PRON- do not understand something however that impose reverence and profound respect 
for the first time in -PRON- life embarrassment seize upon -PRON- upon this joker this wearer of clothe this teller of funny story with -PRON- large red ear bald head and comic actor face

thus -PRON- write dabney dead hooven dead harran dead annixter dead broderson dead osterman die behrman alive successful the railroad in possession of quien sabe 
i see -PRON- shoot

these thing i have see -PRON- 
the picture of this day work be from henceforth part of -PRON- mind part of -PRON- have do -PRON- behrman and the owner of the railroad have do -PRON- while all the world look on while the people of these united state look on 
oh come now and try -PRON- theory upon -PRON- -PRON- of the ranchos -PRON- who have suffer -PRON- who oh talk to now of the right of capital talk to of the trust talk to of the equilibrium between the class 
try -PRON- ingenious idea upon -PRON- 
i can not tell whether or not -PRON- theory be excellent 
i do not know if -PRON- idea be plausible 
i do not know how practical be -PRON- scheme of society 
i do not know if the railroad have a right to -PRON- land but i know that harran be dead that annixter be dead that broderson be dead that hooven be dead that osterman be die and that behrman be alive successful triumphant that -PRON- have ride into possession of a principality over the dead body of five man shoot down by -PRON- hire associate can see the outcome 
the railroad will prevail 
the trust will overpower -PRON- 
here in this corner of a great nation here on the edge of the continent here in this valley of the west far from the great centre isolate remote lose the great iron hand crush life from -PRON- crush liberty and the pursuit of happiness from -PRON- and -PRON- little struggle -PRON- moment convulsion of death agony cause not one jar in the vast clash machinery of the nation life a fleck of grit in the wheel perhaps a grain of sand in the momentary creak of the axle be the mother wail of bereavement the wifes cry of the great wheel turn spin smooth again even again and the tiny impediment of a second scarce notice be forget 
make the people believe that the faint tremour in -PRON- great engine be a menace to -PRON- function 
what a folly to think of -PRON- 
tell -PRON- of the danger and -PRON- will laugh at -PRON- 
tell -PRON- five year from now the story of the fight between the league of the san joaquin and the railroad and -PRON- will not be believe 
what a pitched battle between farmer and railroad a battle that cost the life of seven man 
impossible -PRON- could not have happen 
-PRON- story be exaggerated 
yet -PRON- be help -PRON- god enlighten -PRON- god rouse -PRON- from -PRON- be lexington farmer with gun in -PRON- hand fight for liberty 
be -PRON- state of california the only one that have -PRON- ancient and hereditary foe 
be there no other trust between the ocean than this of the pacific and southwestern railroad 
ask yourself -PRON- of the middle west ask yourself -PRON- of the north ask yourself -PRON- of the east ask yourself -PRON- of the yourself every citizen of every state from maine to mexico from the dakota to the carolina have -PRON- not the monster in -PRON- boundary 
if -PRON- be not a trust of transportation -PRON- be only another head of the same hydra 
be not -PRON- death struggle typical 
be -PRON- not one of many be -PRON- not symbolical of the great and terrible conflict that be go on everywhere in these united state 
ah -PRON- people blind bound trick betray can -PRON- not see -PRON- 
can -PRON- not see how the monster have plunder -PRON- treasure and hold -PRON- in the grip of -PRON- iron claws dole -PRON- out to -PRON- only at the price of -PRON- blood at the price of the life of -PRON- wife and -PRON- little child 
-PRON- give -PRON- baby to moloch for the loaf of bread -PRON- have knead yourself 
-PRON- offer -PRON- starve wife to juggernaut for the iron nail -PRON- have yourself compound 
-PRON- spend the night over -PRON- journal write down such thought as these or walk the floor from wall to wall or seize at time with unreasoning horror and blind rage fling -PRON- face downward upon -PRON- bed vow with inarticulate cry that neither behrman nor shelgrim should ever live to consummate -PRON- triumph 
morning come and with -PRON- the daily paper and news 
presley do not even glance at the mercury 
bonneville publish two other daily journal that profess to voice the will and reflect the temper of the people and these -PRON- read eagerly 
osterman be yet alive and there be chance of -PRON- recovery 
the three hundred of -PRON- member have gather at bonneville over night and be patrol the street and still resolve to keep the peace be even guard the railroad shop and building 
furthermore the leaguer have issue manifesto urge all citizen to preserve law and order yet summon an indignation meeting to be convene that afternoon at the city opera house 
-PRON- appear from the newspaper that those who obstruct the marshal in the discharge of -PRON- duty could be proceed against by the district attorney on information or by bring the matter before the grand jury 
but the grand jury be not at that time in session and -PRON- be know that there be no fund in the marshal office to pay expense for the summoning of juror or the serving of process 
behrman and ruggle in interview state that the railroad withdraw entirely from the fight the matter now accord to -PRON- be between the leaguer and the united state government -PRON- wash -PRON- hand of the whole business 
the rancher could settle with washington 
but -PRON- seem that congress have recently forbid the use of troop for civil purpose the whole matter of the leaguerailroad contest be evidently for the moment to be leave in status quo 
but to mind the most important piece of news that morning be the report of the action of the railroad upon hearing of the battle 
instantly bonneville have be isolate 
not a single local train be run not one of the through train make any halt at the station 
the mail be not move 
further than this by some arrangement difficult to understand the telegraph operator at bonneville and guadalajara act under order refuse to receive any telegram except those emanate from railway official 
the story of the fight the story create the first impression be to be tell to san francisco and the outside world by behrman ruggle and the local and agent 
an hour before breakfast the undertaker arrive and take charge of the body of harran and annixter 
presley see neither hilma magnus nor mrs derrick 
the doctor come to look after hilma 
-PRON- breakfast with mrs dyke and presley and from -PRON- presley learn that hilma would recover both from the shock of -PRON- husband death and from -PRON- miscarriage of the previous night 
-PRON- ought to have -PRON- mother with -PRON- say the physician 
-PRON- do nothing but call for -PRON- or beg to be allow to go to -PRON- 
i have try to get a wire through to mrs tree but the company will not take -PRON- and even if i could get word to -PRON- how could -PRON- get down here 
there be no train 
but presley find that -PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to stay at los muerto that day 
gloom and the shadow of tragedy brood heavy over the place 
a great silence pervade everything a silence break only by the subdue come and go of the undertaker and -PRON- assistant 
when presley have resolve to go into bonneville come out through the doorway of the house -PRON- find the undertaker tie a long strip of crape to the bellhandle 
presley saddle -PRON- pony and ride into town 
by this time after long hour of continued reflection upon one subject a sombre brooding malevolence a deepseate desire of revenge have grow big within -PRON- mind 
the first numbness have pass off familiarity with what have be do have blunt the edge of horror and now the impulse of retaliation prevail 
at first the sullen anger of defeat the sense of outrage have only smoulder but the more -PRON- brood the fiercer flame -PRON- rage 
sudden paroxysm of wrath grip -PRON- by the throat abrupt outburst of fury inject -PRON- eye with blood 
-PRON- grind -PRON- tooth -PRON- mouth fill with curse -PRON- hand clench till -PRON- grow white and bloodless 
be the railroad to triumph then in the end 
after all those month of preparation after all those grandiloquent resolution after all the arrogant presumption of the league 
the league what a farce what have -PRON- amount to when the crisis come 
be the trust to crush -PRON- all so easily 
be behrman to swallow los muertos 
behrman 
presley see -PRON- plainly huge rotund white see -PRON- jowl tremulous and obese the roll of fat over -PRON- collar sprinkle with sparse hair the great stomach with -PRON- brown linen vest and heavy watch chain of hollow link clink against the button of imitation pearl 
and this man be to crush magnus already stamp the life from such man as harran and annixter 
this man in the name of the trust be to grab los muertos as -PRON- have grab quien sabe and after los muertos ranch then then other and still other the whole valley the whole state 
presley beat -PRON- forehead with -PRON- clenched fist as -PRON- ride on 
no -PRON- cry no kill -PRON- kill -PRON- kill -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
the idea of -PRON- put -PRON- beside -PRON- 
oh to sink -PRON- finger deep into the white fat throat of the man to clutch like iron into the great puffed jowl of -PRON- to wrench out the life to batter -PRON- out strangle -PRON- out to pay -PRON- back for the long year of extortion and oppression to square account for bribed juror buy judge corrupt legislature to have justice for the trick of the rancher railroad commission the charlatanism of the ten per cent cut the ruin of dyke the seizure of quien sabe the murder of harran the assassination of annixter 
-PRON- be in such mood that -PRON- reach the saloonkeeper have just open -PRON- place and be stand in -PRON- doorway smoke -PRON- pipe 
presley dismount and go in and the two have a long talk 
when three hour later presley come out of the saloon and ride on towards bonneville -PRON- face be very pale -PRON- lip shut tight resolute determine 
-PRON- manner be that of a man whose mind be make up 
the hour for the mass meeting at the opera house have be set for one oclock but long before noon the street in front of the building and in fact all the street in -PRON- vicinity be pack from side to side with a shift struggle surge and excited multitude 
there be few woman in the throng but hardly a single male inhabitant of either bonneville or guadalajara be absent 
man have even come from visalia and pixley 
-PRON- be no longer the crowd of curiosity seeker that have throng around place by the irrigating ditch the people be no longer confused bewilder 
a full realisation of just what have be do the day before be clear now in the mind of all 
business be suspend nearly all the store be closed 
since early morning the member of the league have put in an appearance and ride from point to point -PRON- rifle across -PRON- saddle pommel 
then by ten oclock the street have begin to fill up the group on the corner grow and merge into one another pedestrian unable to find room on the sidewalk take to the street 
hourly the crowd increase till shoulder touch and elbow till free circulation become impeded then congest then impossible 
the crowd a solid mass be wedge tight from store front to store front 
and from all this throng this single unit this live breathing rise a droning terrible note 
-PRON- be not yet the wild fierce clamour of riot and insurrection shrill high pitch but -PRON- be a beginning the growl of the awaken brute feel the iron in -PRON- flank heave up -PRON- head with bared tooth the throat vibrate to the long indrawn snarl of wrath 
thus the forenoon pass while the people -PRON- bulk grow hourly vaster keep to the street move slowly backward and forward oscillating in the groove of the thoroughfare the steady lowpitche growl rise continually into the hot still air 
then at length about twelve oclock the movement of the throng assume definite direction 
-PRON- set towards the opera house 
presley who have leave -PRON- pony at the city livery stable find -PRON- catch in the current and carry slowly forward in -PRON- direction 
-PRON- arm be pinion to -PRON- side by the press the crush against -PRON- body be all but ribcracke -PRON- could hardly draw -PRON- breath 
all around -PRON- rise and fall wave after wave of face hundred upon hundred thousand upon thousand red lowering sullen 
all be set in one direction and slowly slowly -PRON- advance crowd closer till -PRON- almost touch one another 
for reason that be inexplicable great tumultuous heaving like groundswell of an incoming tide surge over and through the multitude 
at time presley lift from -PRON- foot be sweep back back back with the crowd till the entrance of the opera house be half a block away then the return billow beat back again and swing -PRON- along gasp staggering clutching till -PRON- be land once more in the vortex of frantic action in front of the foyer 
here the wave be short quicker the crush pressure on all side of -PRON- body leave -PRON- without strength to utter the cry that rise to -PRON- lip then suddenly the whole mass of struggle stamp fight writhe man about -PRON- seem as -PRON- be to rise to lift multitudinous swell gigantic 
a mighty rush dash presley forward in -PRON- leap 
there be a moment whirl of confused sight congest face open mouth bloodshot eye clutch hand a moment outburst of furious sound shout cheer oath a moment jam wherein presley veritably believe -PRON- rib must snap like pipestem and -PRON- be carry dazed breathless helpless an atom on the crest of a stormdriven wave up the step of the opera house on into the vestibule through the door and at last into the auditorium of the house -PRON- 
there be a mad rush for place man disdain the aisle step from one orchestra chair to another striding over the back of seat leave the print of dusty foot upon the red plush cushion 
in a twinkling the house be fill from stage to topmost gallery 
the aisle be pack solid even on the edge of the stage -PRON- man be sit a black fringe on either side of the footlight 
the curtain be up disclose a halfset flat lean at perilous represent some sort of terrace the pavement alternate square of black and white marble while red white and yellow flower be represent as grow from urn and vase 
a long double row of chair stretch across the scene from wing to wing flank a table cover with a red cloth on which be set a pitcher of water and a speaker gavel 
promptly these chair be fill up with member of the league the audience cheer as certain wellknown figure make -PRON- of the ruby ranch gething of the san pablo keast of the ranch of the same name chattern of the bonanza elderly man beard slow of speech deliberate 
garnett open the meeting -PRON- speech be plain straightforward matteroffact 
-PRON- simply tell what have happen 
-PRON- announce that certain resolution be to be draw up 
-PRON- introduce the next speaker 
this one plead for moderation 
-PRON- be conservative 
all along -PRON- have oppose the idea of armed resistance except as the very last resort 
-PRON- deplore the terrible affair of yesterday 
-PRON- beg the people to wait in patience to attempt no more violence 
-PRON- inform -PRON- that armed guard of the league be at that moment patrolling los muertos and -PRON- be well know that the united state marshal confess -PRON- powerless to serve the writ 
there would be no more bloodshed 
-PRON- have have -PRON- continue bloodshe enough and i want to say right here that i be not so sure but what yesterday terrible affair may have be avoid 
a gentleman whom -PRON- all esteem who from the first have be -PRON- recognise leader be at this moment mourn the loss of a young son kill before -PRON- eye 
god know that i sympathise as do -PRON- all in the affliction of -PRON- president 
i be sorry for -PRON- 
-PRON- heart go out to -PRON- in this hour of distress but at the same time the position of the league must be define 
-PRON- owe -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- owe -PRON- to the people of this county 
the league arm for the very purpose of preserve the peace not of break -PRON- 
-PRON- believe that with six hundred armed and drill man at -PRON- disposal ready to muster at a moment call -PRON- could so overawe any attempt to expel -PRON- from -PRON- land that such an attempt would not be make until the case pende before the supreme court have be decide 
if when the enemy appear in -PRON- midst yesterday -PRON- have be meet by six hundred rifle -PRON- be not conceivable that the issue would have be force 
no fight would have ensue and today -PRON- would not have to mourn the death of four of -PRON- fellowcitizen 
a mistake have be make and -PRON- of the league must not be hold responsible 
the speaker sit down amidst loud applause from the leaguer and less pronounced demonstration on the part of the audience 
a second leaguer take -PRON- place a tall clumsy man halfrancher halfpolitician want to second what -PRON- colleague have just say -PRON- begin 
this matter of resist the marshal when -PRON- try to put the railroad dummy in possession on the ranch around here be all talk over in the committee meeting of the league long ago 
-PRON- never be -PRON- intention to fire a single shot 
no such absolute authority as be assume yesterday be delegate to anybody 
-PRON- esteemed president be all right but -PRON- all know that -PRON- be a man who love authority and who like to go -PRON- own gait without account to anybody rest of -PRON- be inform as to what be go on 
-PRON- suppose of course that watch be be keep on the railroad so as -PRON- wouldnot be take by surprise as -PRON- be yesterday 
and -PRON- seem no watch be keep at all or if there be -PRON- be mighty ineffective 
-PRON- idea be to forestall any movement on the part of the railroad and then when -PRON- know the marshal be come down to call a meeting of -PRON- executive committee and decide as to what should be do 
-PRON- ought to have have time to call out the whole league 
instead of that what happen 
while be all off chase rabbit the railroad be allow to steal a march on -PRON- and when -PRON- be too late a handful of leaguer be get together and a fight be precipitate and -PRON- man kill sorry for -PRON- president too 
no one be more so but i want to put -PRON- on record as believe -PRON- do a hasty and inconsiderate thing 
if -PRON- have manage right -PRON- could have have six hundred man to oppose the railroad and there would not have be any gun fight or any killing 
-PRON- manage right and there a killing and i donot see as how the league ought to be hold responsible 
the idea of the league the whole reason why -PRON- be organise be to protect the ranch of this valley from the railroad and -PRON- look to -PRON- as if the life of -PRON- fellowcitizen have be sacrifice not in defending of -PRON- ranch but just in defence of one of one that mr derrick own 
the speaker have no more than regain -PRON- seat when a man be see push -PRON- way from the back of the stage towards garnett 
-PRON- hand the rancher a note at the same time whisper in -PRON- ear 
garnett read the note then come forward to the edge of the stage hold up -PRON- hand 
when the audience have fall silent -PRON- say have just receive sad news 
-PRON- friend and fellowcitizen mr osterman die this morning between eleven and twelve oclock 
instantly there be a roar 
every man in the building rise to -PRON- foot shout gesticulate 
the roar increase the opera house tremble to -PRON- the gas jet in the light chandelier vibrate to -PRON- 
-PRON- be a raucous howl of execration a bellow of rage inarticulate deafen 
a tornado of confusion sweep whirl from wall to wall and the madness of the moment seize irresistibly upon presley 
-PRON- forget -PRON- -PRON- no longer be master of -PRON- emotion or -PRON- impulse 
all at once -PRON- find -PRON- upon the stage face the audience flame with excitement -PRON- imagination on fire -PRON- arm uplift in fierce wild gesture word leap to -PRON- mind in a torrent that could not be withhold 
one more dead -PRON- cry one more

how long must this terror of steam and steel ride upon -PRON- neck

go on as -PRON- have begin and -PRON- come to that 
turn a deaf ear to that cry of let -PRON- people go too long and another cry will be raise that -PRON- can not choose but hear a cry that -PRON- can not shut out

take care oh as -PRON- love -PRON- life take care lest some day call upon the lord -PRON- god -PRON- reach not out -PRON- arm for the pillar of -PRON- temple

vaguely -PRON- have feel that here be something which other possibly consider eloquent 
-PRON- applaud vociferously but perfunctorily in order to appear to understand 
presley for all -PRON- love of the people see clearly for one moment that -PRON- be an outsider to -PRON- mind 
-PRON- have not help -PRON- nor -PRON- cause in the least -PRON- never would 
disappointed bewilder ashamed -PRON- make -PRON- way slowly from the opera house and stand on the step outside thoughtful -PRON- head bent

as often as that happen the governor seem to beoh i donot know frightened 
-PRON- will sink -PRON- head between -PRON- shoulder as though -PRON- be dodge something and -PRON- wonot fetch a long breath again till the train be out of hear

-PRON- need look after -PRON- pre 
oh once away from bonneville and the sight of the ruin there well 
but i intend to go away

why certainly pre declare cedarquist

the league go all to piece so soon as magnu be force to resign 
the old get quarrel among -PRON- 
somebody start a compromise party and upon that issue a new president be elect 
then there be defection 
the railroad offer to lease the land in question to the rancher who own -PRON- -PRON- exclaim bitterly and because the term be of the man take the chance of save -PRON- 
and of course once sign the lease -PRON- acknowledge the title 
but the road would not lease to magnus 
behrman take over los muertos in a few week now 
no doubt the road make over -PRON- title in the property to -PRON- observed cedarquist as a reward of -PRON- service

regain the street presley send -PRON- valise to -PRON- club where -PRON- have engage a room by a messenger boy and board a castro street car 
before leave bonneville -PRON- have ascertain by strenuous enquiry mrs address in the city and thitherward -PRON- now direct -PRON- step 
when presley have tell cedarquist that -PRON- be ill that -PRON- be jade wear out -PRON- have only tell half the truth 
exhaust -PRON- be nerveless weak but this apathy be still invade from time to time with fierce incursion of a spirit of unrest and revolt reaction momentary return of the blind undirected energy that at one time have prompt -PRON- to a vast desire to acquit -PRON- of some terrible deed of readjustment just what -PRON- could not say some terrifying martyrdom some aweinspire immolation consummate incisive conclusive 
-PRON- fancy -PRON- to be fire with the purblind mistaken heroism of the anarchist hurl -PRON- victim to destruction with full knowledge that the catastrophe shall sweep -PRON- also into the vortex -PRON- create 
but -PRON- constitutional irresoluteness obstruct -PRON- path continually brainsick weak of will emotional timid even -PRON- temporise procrastinate brood come to decision in the dark hour of the night only to abandon -PRON- in the morning 
once only -PRON- have and at this moment as -PRON- be carry through the windy squalid street -PRON- tremble at the remembrance of -PRON- 
the horror of what may have be incompatible with the vengeance whose minister -PRON- fancy -PRON- be oppress -PRON- 
the scene perpetually reconstruct -PRON- in -PRON- imagination 
-PRON- see -PRON- under the shade of the encompass tree and shrubbery creeping on -PRON- belly toward the house in the suburb of bonneville watch -PRON- chance seize opportunity spy upon the light window where the raise curtain afford a view of the interior 
then have come the appearance in the glare of the gas of the figure of the man for whom -PRON- wait 
-PRON- see -PRON- rise and run forward 
-PRON- remember the feel and weight in -PRON- hand of six inch of plug gas pipe 
-PRON- upraised arm shoot forward 
there be a shiver of smash windowpanes red whirl of confusion the air rent the ground rock -PRON- fling headlong fling off the spinning circumference of thing out into a place of terror and vacancy and darkness 
and then after a long time the return of reason the consciousness that -PRON- foot be set upon the road to los muertos and that -PRON- be flee terrorstricken gasping all but insane with hysteria 
then the night that ensue when -PRON- descend into the pit horrify at what -PRON- suppose -PRON- have do at one moment ride with remorse at another raging against -PRON- own feebleness -PRON- lack of courage -PRON- wretched vacillating spirit 
but morning have come and with -PRON- the knowledge that -PRON- have fail and the baser assurance that -PRON- be not even remotely suspect 
-PRON- own escape have be no less miraculous than that of -PRON- enemy and -PRON- have fall on -PRON- knee in inarticulate prayer weeping pour out -PRON- thank to god for the deliverance from the gulf to the very brink of which -PRON- foot have be draw 
after this however there have come to presley a deeproote suspicion that -PRON- all human being the most failure 
everything to which -PRON- have set -PRON- mind great epic -PRON- effort to help the people who surround -PRON- even -PRON- attempt destruction of the enemy all these have come to nothing 
gird -PRON- shatter strength together -PRON- resolve upon one last attempt to live up to the good that be in -PRON- and to that end have set -PRON- to lift out of the despair into which -PRON- have be thrust the bereave family of the german hooven 
after all be over and hooven together with the seven other who have fall at the irrigate ditch be bury in the bonneville cemetery mrs hooven ask no one aid or advice and take with -PRON- minna and little hilda have go to san go to find work abandon los muertos and -PRON- home forever 
presley only learn of the departure of the family after fifteen day have elapse 
at once however the suspicion force -PRON- upon -PRON- that mrs minna too for the matter of thatcountrybre ignorant of city way may easily come to grief in the hard huge struggle of city life 
this suspicion have swiftly harden to a conviction act at last upon which presley have follow -PRON- to san francisco bent upon find and assist -PRON- 
the house to which presley be lead by the address in -PRON- memorandum book be a cheap but fairly decent hotel near the power house of the castro street cable 
-PRON- inquire for mrs hooven 
the landlady recollect the hooven perfectly 
german woman with a little girlbaby and an old daughter sure 
the old daughter be main pretty 
sure i remember -PRON- but -PRON- ainot here no more

what have -PRON- get to say about -PRON- hear -PRON- 
presley turn away with a gesture of discouragement -PRON- heart sink 
on the street corner -PRON- stand for a long time frowning in trouble and perplexity 
-PRON- suspicion have be only too well found 
so long ago as a week the hooven have exhaust all -PRON- little store of money 
for seven day now -PRON- have be without resource unless indeed work have be find and what -PRON- ask -PRON- what work in name could -PRON- find to do here in the city 
seven day 
-PRON- quail at the thought of -PRON- 
seven day without money know not a soul in all that swarm city 
ignorant of city life as both minna and -PRON- mother be would -PRON- even realise that there be institution build and generously endow for just such as -PRON- 
-PRON- know -PRON- to have -PRON- share of pride the dog sullen pride of the peasant even if -PRON- know of charitable organisation would -PRON- could -PRON- bring -PRON- to apply there 
a poignant anxiety thrust -PRON- sharply into heart 
where be -PRON- now 
where have -PRON- sleep last night 
where breakfast this morning 
have there even be any breakfast this morning 
have there even be any bed last night 
lose and forget in the plexus of the citys life what have befall -PRON- 
towards what fate be the ebb tide of the street drift -PRON- 
be this to be still another theme work out by iron hand upon the old the worldold worldwide keynote 
how far be the consequence of that dreadful day work at the irrigate ditch to reach 
to what length be the tentacle of the monster to extend 
presley return toward the central the business quarter of the city alternately formulate and dismiss from -PRON- mind plan after plan for the finding and aiding of mrs hooven and -PRON- daughter 
-PRON- reach montgomery street and turn toward -PRON- club -PRON- imagination once more review all the cause and circumstance of the great battle of which for the last eighteen month -PRON- have be witness 
all at once -PRON- pause -PRON- eye catch by a sign affix to the wall just inside the street entrance of a huge office building and smite with an idea stand for an instant motionless upon the sidewalk -PRON- eye wide -PRON- fist shut tight 
the building contain the general office of the pacific and southwestern railroad 
large though -PRON- be -PRON- nevertheless be not pretentious and during -PRON- visit to the city presley must have pass -PRON- unheede many time 
but for all that -PRON- be the stronghold of the centre of all that vast ramify system of artery that drain the lifeblood of the state the nucleus of the web in which so many life so many fortune so many destiny have be enmesh 
from this -PRON- tell emanate that policy of extortion oppression and injustice that little by little have shoulder the rancher from -PRON- right till -PRON- back to the wall exasperate and despair -PRON- have turn and fight and die 
from here have come the order to behrman to cyrus ruggle and to genslinger the order that have bring dyke to a prison that have kill annixter that have ruin magnus that have corrupt lyman 
here be the keep of the castle and here behind one of those many window in one of those many office -PRON- hand upon the lever of -PRON- mighty engine sit the master shelgrim -PRON- 
instantly upon the realisation of this fact an ungovernable desire seize upon presley an inordinate curiosity 
why not see face to face the man whose power be so vast whose will be so resistless whose potency for evil so limitless the man who for so long and so hopelessly -PRON- have all be fight 
by reputation -PRON- know -PRON- to be approachable why should -PRON- not then approach -PRON- 
presley take -PRON- resolution in both hand 
if -PRON- fail to act upon this impulse -PRON- know -PRON- would never act at all 
-PRON- heart beat -PRON- breath come short -PRON- enter the building and in a few moment find -PRON- seat in an anteroom -PRON- eye fix with hypnotic intensity upon the frosted pane of an adjoin door whereon in gold letter be inscribe the word in the end presley have be surprised to find that shelgrim be still in 
-PRON- be already very late after six oclock and the other office in the building be in the act of closing 
many of -PRON- be already desert 
at every instant through the open door of the anteroom -PRON- catch a glimpse of clerk office boy bookkeeper and other employee hurry towards the stair and elevator quit business for the day 
shelgrim -PRON- seem still remain at -PRON- desk know no fatigue require no leisure 
what time do mr shelgrim usually go home inquire presley of the young man who sit rule form at the table in the anteroom 
anywhere between halfpast six and seven the other answer add very often -PRON- come back in the evening 
and the man be seventy year old 
presley could not repress a murmur of astonishment 
not only mentally then be the president of the and a giant 
seventy year of age and still at -PRON- post hold there with the energy with a concentration of purpose that would have wreck the health and impair the mind of many man in the prime of -PRON- manhood 
but the next instant presley set -PRON- tooth 
-PRON- be an ogre vitality -PRON- say to -PRON- 
just so be the maneate tiger strong 
the man should have energy who have suck the lifeblood from an entire people 
a little electric bell on the wall near at hand trill a warning 
the young man who be rule form lay down -PRON- pen and open the door of the office thrust in -PRON- head then after a word exchange with the unseen occupant of the room -PRON- swing the door wide say to presley mr shelgrim will see -PRON- sir 
presley enter a large well light but singularly barren office 
a wellworn carpet be on the floor two steel engraving hang against the wall an extra chair or two stand near a large plain littered table 
that be absolutely all unless -PRON- except the corner washstand on which be set a pitcher of ice water cover with a clean stiff napkin 
a man evidently some sort of manager assistant stand at the end of the table lean on the back of one of the chair 
shelgrim -PRON- sit at the table 
-PRON- be large almost to massiveness 
an irongrey beard and a mustache that completely hide the mouth cover the low part of -PRON- face 
-PRON- eye be a pale blue and a little watery here and there upon -PRON- face be moth spot 
but the enormous breadth of the shoulder be what at first most vividly force -PRON- upon notice 
never have -PRON- see a broad man the neck however seem in a manner to have settle into the shoulder and furthermore -PRON- be humped and round as if to bear great responsibility and great abuse 
at the moment -PRON- be wear a silk skullcap push to one side and a little awry a frock coat of broadcloth with long sleeve and a waistcoat from the low button of which the cloth be wear and upon the edge rub away show the metal underneath 
at the top this waistcoat be unbuttoned and in the shirt front disclose be two pearl stud 
presley uninvited unnoticed apparently sit down 
the assistant manager be in the act of make a report 
-PRON- voice be not lower and presley hear every word that be speak 
the report prove interesting 
-PRON- concern a bookkeeper in the office of the auditor of disbursement 
-PRON- seem -PRON- be at most time thoroughly reliable hardworking industrious ambitious 
but at long interval the vice of drunkenness seize upon the man and for three day ride -PRON- like a hag 
not only during the period of this intemperance but for the few day immediately follow the man be useless -PRON- work untrustworthy 
-PRON- be a family man and earnestly strove to rid -PRON- of -PRON- habit -PRON- be when sober valuable 
in consideration of these fact -PRON- have be pardon again and again 
-PRON- remember mr shelgrim observe the manager that -PRON- have more than once interfere in -PRON- behalf when -PRON- be dispose to let -PRON- go 
i donot think -PRON- can do anything with -PRON- sir 
-PRON- promise to reform continually but -PRON- be the same old story 
this last time -PRON- see nothing of -PRON- for four day 
honestly mr shelgrim i think -PRON- ought to let tentell out 
-PRON- canot afford to keep -PRON- 
-PRON- be really lose -PRON- too much money the order ready now if -PRON- care to let -PRON- go 
there be a pause 
presley all attention listen breathlessly 
the assistant manager lay before -PRON- president the typewritten order in question 
the silence lengthen in the hall outside the wroughtiron door of the elevator cage slide to with a clash 
shelgrim do not look at the order 
-PRON- turn -PRON- swivel chair about and face the window behind -PRON- look out with unseeing eye 
at last -PRON- speak tentell have a family wife and three child 
how much do -PRON- pay -PRON- 
one hundred and thirty double that or say two hundred and fifty see how that will do -PRON- say so but really mr shelgrim well well try that anyhow 
presley have not time to readjust -PRON- perspective to this new point of view of the president of the and before the assistant manager have withdraw 
shelgrim write a few memoranda on -PRON- calendar pad and sign a couple of letter before turn -PRON- attention to presley 
at last -PRON- look up and fix the young man with a direct grave glance 
-PRON- do not smile 
-PRON- be some time before -PRON- speak 
at last -PRON- say well sir 
presley advanced and take a chair nearer at hand 
shelgrim turn and from -PRON- desk pick up and consult card 
presley observe that -PRON- read without the use of glass 
-PRON- -PRON- say again face about -PRON- be the young man who write the poem call the toiler yes sir 
-PRON- seem to have make a great deal of talk read -PRON- and see the picture in house the picture -PRON- take the idea from 
presley -PRON- sense never more alive observe that curiously enough shelgrim do not move -PRON- body 
-PRON- arm move and -PRON- head but the great bulk of the man remain immobile in -PRON- place and as the interview proceed and this peculiarity emphasise -PRON- presley begin to conceive the odd idea that shelgrim have as -PRON- be place -PRON- body in the chair to rest while -PRON- head and brain and hand go on work independently 
a saucer of shelled filbert stand near -PRON- elbow and from time to time -PRON- pick up one of these in a great thumb and forefinger and put -PRON- between -PRON- tooth see the picture call the toiler continue shelgrim and of the two i like the picture better than the poem 
the picture be by a master presley hasten to interpose 
and for that reason say shelgrim -PRON- leave nothing more to be say 
-PRON- may just as well have keep quiet only one good way to say anything 
and what have make the picture of the toiler great be that the artist say in -PRON- the that could be say on the subject have never look at -PRON- in just that light observe presley 
-PRON- be confuse all at sea embarrassed 
what -PRON- have expect to find in shelgrim -PRON- could not have exactly say 
but -PRON- have be prepare to come upon an ogre a brute a terrible man of blood and iron and instead have discover a sentimentalist and an art critic 
no standard of measurement in -PRON- mental equipment would apply to the actual man and -PRON- begin to dawn upon -PRON- that possibly -PRON- be not because these standard be different in kind but that -PRON- be lamentably deficient in size 
-PRON- begin to see that here be the man not only great but large manysided of vast sympathy who understand with equal intelligence the human nature in an habitual drunkard the ethic of a masterpiece of painting and the financiering and operation of ten thousand mile of railroad have never look at -PRON- in just that light repeat presley 
there be a great deal in what -PRON- say 
if i be to listen continue shelgrim to that kind of talk i prefer to listen to -PRON- first hand 
i would rather listen to what the great french painter have to say than to what have to say about what -PRON- have already say 
-PRON- speech loud and emphatic at first when the idea of what -PRON- have to say be fresh in -PRON- mind lapse and lower -PRON- at the end of -PRON- sentence as though -PRON- have already abandon and lose interest in that thought so that the conclude word be indistinct beneath the grey beard and mustache 
also at time there be the faint suggestion of a lisp write that poem hazard presley at a time when i be terribly upset 
i live -PRON- conclude or do live on the los muertos ranch in tulare ranch 
the ranch to mr derrick observe shelgrim 
presley spread out -PRON- hand with a helpless resign gesture 
and continue the president of the and with grave intensity look at presley keenly suppose -PRON- believe i be a grand old rascal believe answer presley be persuade -PRON- hesitate search for -PRON- word 
believe this young man exclaim shelgrim lay a thick powerful forefinger on the table to emphasise -PRON- word try to believe begin where there be a demand sooner or later there will be a supply 
mr derrick do -PRON- grow -PRON- wheat 
the wheat grow -PRON- 
what do -PRON- count for 
do -PRON- supply the force 
what do i count for 
do i build the railroad 
-PRON- be deal with force young man when -PRON- speak of wheat and the railroad not with man 
there be the wheat the supply 
-PRON- must be carry to feed the people 
there be the demand 
the wheat be one force the railroad another and there be the law that govern and demand 
man have only little to do in the whole business 
complication may arise condition that bear hard on the -PRON- as inevitably as -PRON- will grow 
if -PRON- want to fasten the blame of the affair at los muerto on any one person -PRON- will make a mistake 
blame condition not man falter presley -PRON- be the head -PRON- control the road 
-PRON- be a very young man 
control the road 
can i stop -PRON- 
i can go into bankruptcy if -PRON- like 
but otherwise if i run -PRON- road as a business proposition i can do nothing 
i can not control -PRON- 
-PRON- be a force bear out of certain condition and stop -PRON- or control -PRON- 
can -PRON- mr derrick stop the wheat grow 
-PRON- can burn -PRON- crop or -PRON- can give -PRON- away or sell -PRON- for a cent a as i could go into otherwise -PRON- wheat must grow 
can any one stop the wheat 
well then no more can i stop the road 
presley regain the street stupefy -PRON- brain in a whirl 
this new idea this new conception dumfounde -PRON- 
somehow -PRON- could not deny -PRON- 
-PRON- ring with the clear reverberation of truth 
be no one then to blame for the horror at the irrigate ditch 
force condition law of supply and these then the enemy after all 
not enemy there be no malevolence in nature 
colossal indifference only a vast trend toward appoint goal 
nature be then a gigantic engine a vast cyclopean power huge terrible a leviathan with a heart of steel know no compunction no forgiveness no tolerance crush out the human atom stand in -PRON- way with nirvanic calm the agony of destruction send never a jar never the faint tremour through all that prodigious mechanism of wheel and cog 
-PRON- go to -PRON- club and eat -PRON- supper alone in gloomy agitation 
-PRON- be sombre brooding lose in a dark maze of gloomy reflection 
however just as -PRON- be rise from the table an incident occur that for the moment rouse -PRON- and sharply divert -PRON- mind 
-PRON- table have be place near a window and as -PRON- be sip -PRON- afterdinn coffee -PRON- happen to glance across the street 
-PRON- eye be at once catch by the sight of a familiar figure 
be -PRON- minna hooven 
the figure turn the street corner and be lose to sight but -PRON- have be strangely like 
on the moment presley have rise from the table and clap on -PRON- hat have hurry into the street where the lamp be already begin to shine 
but search though -PRON- would presley could not again come upon the young woman in whom -PRON- fancy -PRON- have see the daughter of the unfortunate german 
at last -PRON- give up the hunt and return to -PRON- this hour almost a few cigarette vainly attempt to read from a volume of essay in the library and at last nervous distraught exhausted retire to -PRON- bed 
but none the less presley have not be mistake 
the girl whom -PRON- have try to follow have be indeed minna hooven 
when minna a week before this time have return to the lodging house on castro street after a day unsuccessful effort to find employment and be tell that -PRON- mother and hilda have go -PRON- be strike speechless with surprise and dismay 
-PRON- have never before be in any town large than bonneville and now know not which way to turn nor how to account for the disappearance of -PRON- mother and little hilda 
that the landlady be on the point of turn -PRON- out -PRON- understand but -PRON- have be agree that the family should be allow to stay yet one more day in the hope that minna would find work 
of this -PRON- remind the landlady 
but this latter at once launch upon -PRON- such a torrent of vituperation that the girl be frightened to speechless submission 
oh oh -PRON- falter know 
i be sorry 
i know -PRON- owe -PRON- money but where do -PRON- mother go 
i only want to find -PRON- 
oh i ainot go to be bother shrill the other 
how do i know 
the truth of the matter be that mrs hooven afraid to stay in the vicinity of the house after -PRON- eviction and threaten with arrest by the landlady if -PRON- persist in hang around have leave with the woman a note scrawl on an old blotter to be give to minna when -PRON- return 
this the landlady have lose 
to cover -PRON- confusion -PRON- affect a vast indignation and a turbulent irascible demeanour ainot go to be bother with such cattle as -PRON- -PRON- vociferate in face donot know where -PRON- folk be 
-PRON- i only have dealing with honest people 
i ainot get a word to say so long as the rent be pay 
but when soldier out of a week lodge then do 
-PRON- get right along now 
i donot know -PRON- 
i ainot go to have -PRON- place get a bad name by have any south of market street chippie hang around 
-PRON- get along or call an officer 
minna seek the street -PRON- head in a whirl 
-PRON- be about five oclock 
in -PRON- pocket be thirtyfive cent all -PRON- have in the world 
what now 
all at once the terror of the city that blind unreasoned fear that only the outcast know swoop upon -PRON- and clutch -PRON- vulturewise by the throat 
-PRON- first few day experience in the matter of find employment have teach -PRON- just what -PRON- may expect from this new world upon which -PRON- have be throw 
what be to become of -PRON- 
what be -PRON- to do where be -PRON- to go 
unanswerable grim question and now -PRON- no longer have -PRON- to fear for 
-PRON- mother and the baby little hilda both of -PRON- equally unable to look after -PRON- what be to become of -PRON- where be -PRON- go 
lose lose all of -PRON- -PRON- as well 
but -PRON- rally -PRON- as -PRON- walk along 
the idea of -PRON- starving of -PRON- mother and hilda starving be out of all reason 
of course -PRON- would not come to that of course not 
-PRON- be not thus that starvation come 
something would happen of course -PRON- time 
but meanwhile meanwhile how to get through this approach night and the next few day 
that be the thing to think of just now 
the suddenness of -PRON- all be what most unnerve -PRON- 
during all the nineteen year of -PRON- life -PRON- have never know what -PRON- mean to shift for -PRON- 
-PRON- father have always suffice for the family -PRON- have take care of -PRON- then all of a sudden -PRON- father have be kill -PRON- mother snatch from -PRON- 
then all of a sudden there be no help anywhere 
then all of a sudden a terrible voice demand of -PRON- now just what can -PRON- do to keep -PRON- alive 
life face -PRON- -PRON- look the huge stone image squarely in the lustreless eye 
-PRON- be nearly twilight 
minna for the sake of avoid -PRON- seem to -PRON- that now a thousand pry glance follow a demeanour and begin to walk briskly toward the business quarter of the town 
-PRON- be dress neatly enough in a blue cloth skirt with a blue plush belt fairly decent shoe once -PRON- mother a pink shirt waist and jacket and a straw sailor 
-PRON- be in an unusual fashion pretty 
even -PRON- trouble have not dim the bright light of -PRON- pale greenishblue eye nor fade the astonishing redness of -PRON- lip nor hollow -PRON- strangely white face 
-PRON- blueblack hair be trim 
-PRON- carry -PRON- wellshape wellrounded figure erectly 
even in -PRON- distress -PRON- observe that man look keenly at -PRON- and sometimes after -PRON- as -PRON- go along 
but this -PRON- note with a dim subconscious faculty 
the real minna harass terrify lash with a thousand anxiety keep murmur under -PRON- breath what shall i do what shall i do oh what shall i do now 
after an interminable walk -PRON- gain kearney street and hold -PRON- till the welllighte wellkept neighbourhood of the shopping district give place to the vicecrowded saloon and concert hall of the barbary coast 
-PRON- turn aside in avoidance of this only to plunge into the purlieus of chinatown whence only -PRON- emerge panicstricken and out of breath after a half hour of terror and at a time when -PRON- have grow quite dark 
on the corner of california and dupont street -PRON- stand a long moment ponder do something -PRON- say to -PRON- must do -PRON- be tired out by now and the idea occur to -PRON- to enter the catholic church in whose shadow -PRON- stand and sit down and rest 
this -PRON- do 
the evening service be just be conclude 
but long after the priest and altar boy have depart from the chancel minna still sit in the dim echo interior confront -PRON- desperate situation as best -PRON- may 
two or three hour later the sexton wake -PRON- 
the church be be close -PRON- must leave 
once more chill with the sharp night air numb with long sit in the same attitude still oppress with drowsiness confuse frightened minna find -PRON- on the pavement 
-PRON- begin to be hungry and at length yield to the demand that every moment grow more imperious buy and eagerly devour a fivecent bag of fruit 
then once more -PRON- take up the round of walking 
at length in an obscure street that branch from kearney street near the corner of the plaza -PRON- come upon an illuminate sign bear the inscription bed for the night and cent 
fifteen cent 
could -PRON- afford -PRON- 
-PRON- would leave -PRON- with only that much more that much between -PRON- and a state of privation of which -PRON- dare not think and besides the forbidding look of the building frighten -PRON- 
-PRON- be dark gloomy dirty a place suggestive of obscure crime and hidden terror 
for twenty minute or half an hour -PRON- hesitate walk twice and three time around the block 
at last -PRON- make up -PRON- mind 
exhaustion such as -PRON- have never know weigh like lead upon -PRON- shoulder and drag at -PRON- heel 
-PRON- must sleep 
-PRON- could not walk the street all night 
-PRON- enter the doorway under the sign and find -PRON- way up a filthy flight of stair 
at the top a man in a blue check jumper be fill a lamp behind a high desk 
to -PRON- minna apply should like -PRON- falter to have a bed for the night 
one of those for fifteen cent will be good enough i think 
well this place be only for man say the man look up from the lamp 
oh say minna didnot know 
-PRON- look at -PRON- stupidly and -PRON- with equal stupidity return the gaze 
thus for a long moment -PRON- hold each other eye didnot know repeat minna 
yes -PRON- for man repeat the other 
-PRON- slowly descend the stair and once more come out upon the street 
and upon those street that as the hour advance grow more and more desert more and more silent more and more oppressive with the sense of the bitter hardness of life towards those who have no means of live minna hooven spend the first night of -PRON- struggle to keep -PRON- head above the ebbtide of the city sea into which -PRON- have be plunge 
morning come and with -PRON- renew hunger 
at this time -PRON- have find -PRON- way uptown again and towards ten oclock be sit upon a bench in a little park full of nursemaid and child 
a group of the maid draw -PRON- babybuggie to bench and sit down continue a conversation -PRON- have already begin 
minna listen 
a friend of one of the maid have suddenly throw up -PRON- position leave -PRON- madame in what would appear to have be deserve embarrassment 
oh say minna break in and lie with sudden unwonted fluency be a nursegirl 
i be out of a place 
do -PRON- think i could get that one 
the group turn and fix evidently a country a supercilious indifference 
well -PRON- may try say one of -PRON-

reference repeat minna blankly 
-PRON- do not know what this mean 
oh mrs field ainot the kind to stick about reference speak up the other that soft 
why anybody could work -PRON- go there say minna

well -PRON- take the ferry at the foot of market street and then the train on the other side 
no -PRON- ainot very far 
just ask any one down there tell -PRON- 
-PRON- be a chance but minna after walk down to the ferry slip find that the round trip would cost -PRON- twenty cent 
if the journey prove fruitless only a dime would stand between -PRON- and the end of everything 
but -PRON- be a chance the only one that have as yet present -PRON- 
-PRON- make the trip 
and upon the streetrailway car upon the ferryboat on the locomotive and waycoache of the local train -PRON- be remind of -PRON- father death and of the giant power that have reduce -PRON- to -PRON- present strait by the letter and to -PRON- mind -PRON- occur everywhere 
-PRON- seem to see -PRON- in every direction 
-PRON- fancy -PRON- surround upon every hand by the long arm of the monster 
minute after minute -PRON- hunger gnaw at -PRON- 
-PRON- could not keep -PRON- mind from -PRON- 
as -PRON- sit on the boat -PRON- find -PRON- curiously scan the face of the passenger wonder how long since such a one have breakfast how long before this other should sit down to lunch 
when minna descend from the train at lorin on the other side of the bay -PRON- find that the place be one of those suburban town not yet become fashionable such as may be see beyond the outskirt of any large american city 
all along the line of the railroad thereabout house small villascontractor scatter the advantage of suburban lot and site for home be proclaim in sevenfoot letter upon mammoth billboard close to the right of way 
without much trouble minna find the house to which -PRON- have be direct a pretty little cottage set back from the street and shade by palm live oak and the inevitable eucalyptus 
-PRON- heart warm at the sight of -PRON- 
oh to find a little niche for -PRON- here a home a refuge from those horrible city street from the rat of famine with -PRON- relentless tooth 
how -PRON- would work how strenuously -PRON- would endeavour to please how patient of rebuke -PRON- would be how faithful how conscientious 
nor be -PRON- pretension altogether false upon -PRON- while at home have devolve almost continually the care of the baby hilda -PRON- little sister 
-PRON- know the want and need of child 
-PRON- heart beat -PRON- breath fail -PRON- ring the bell set squarely in the middle of the front door 
the lady of the house -PRON- an elderly lady with pleasant kindly face open the door 
minna state -PRON- errand 
but i have already engage a girl -PRON- say 
oh murmured minna strive with all -PRON- might to maintain appearance think perhaps -PRON- turn away sorry say the lady 
then -PRON- add would -PRON- care to look after so many as three little child and help around in light housework between while 
yes maam

-PRON- turn back into the house a moment and return hand minna a card where -PRON- not to -PRON- child the ink wet have better see -PRON- 
be -PRON- far 
could i walk there 
-PRON- no -PRON- better take the electric car about six block above here 
when minna arrive in north berkeley -PRON- have no money leave 
by a cruel mistake -PRON- have take a car go in the wrong direction and though -PRON- error be rectify easily enough -PRON- have cost -PRON- -PRON- last fivecent piece 
-PRON- be now to try -PRON- last hope 
promptly -PRON- crumble away 
like the former this place have be already fill and minna leave the door of the house with the certainty that -PRON- chance have come to naught and that now -PRON- enter into the last struggle with death of -PRON- last pitiful defence -PRON- last safeguard -PRON- last penny 
as -PRON- once more resume -PRON- interminable walk -PRON- realise -PRON- be weak faint and -PRON- know that -PRON- be the weakness of complete exhaustion and the faintness of approach starvation 
be this the end come on 
terror of death arouse -PRON- 
i do something oh anything 
i must have something to eat 
at this late hour the idea of pawn -PRON- little jacket occur to -PRON- but now -PRON- be far away from the city and -PRON- pawnshop and there be no get back 
-PRON- walk on 
an hour pass 
-PRON- lose -PRON- sense of direction become confused know not where -PRON- be go turn corner and go up bystreet without know why anything to keep move for -PRON- fancy that so soon as -PRON- stand still the rat in the pit of -PRON- stomach gnaw more eagerly 
at last -PRON- enter what seem to be if not a park at least some sort of public enclosure 
there be many tree the place be beautiful wellkept road and walk lead sinuously and invitingly underneath the shade 
through the tree upon the other side of a wide expanse of turf brown and sear under the summer sun -PRON- catch a glimpse of tall building and a flagstaff 
the whole place have a vaguely public educational appearance and minna guess from certain notice affix to the tree warn the public against the picking of flower that -PRON- have find -PRON- way into the ground of the state university 
-PRON- go on a little further 
the path -PRON- be follow lead -PRON- at length into a grove of gigantic live oak whose low branch all but sweep the ground 
here the grass be green the few flower in bloom the shade very thick 
a more lovely spot -PRON- have seldom see 
near at hand be a bench build around the trunk of the large live oak and here at length weak from hunger exhaust to the limit of -PRON- endurance despair abandon minna hooven sit down to enquire of -PRON- what next -PRON- could do 
but once seat the demand of the -PRON- could more clamorous more insistent 
to eat to rest to be safely house against another night above all else these be the thing -PRON- crave and the craving within -PRON- grow so mighty that -PRON- crisp -PRON- poor starve hand into little fist in an agony of desire while the tear run from -PRON- eye and the sob rise thick from -PRON- breast and struggle and strangle in -PRON- ache throat 
but in a few moment minna be aware that a woman apparently of some thirty year of age have twice pass along the walk in front of the bench where -PRON- sit and now as -PRON- take more notice of -PRON- -PRON- remember that -PRON- have see -PRON- on the ferryboat come over from the city 
the woman be gown in silk tightly corset and wear a hat of rather ostentatious smartness 
minna become convinced that the person be watch -PRON- but before -PRON- have a chance to act upon this conviction -PRON- be surprised out of all countenance by the stranger come up to where -PRON- sit and speak to -PRON- 
here be a coincidence exclaim the newcomer as -PRON- sit down surely -PRON- be the young girl who sit opposite -PRON- on the boat 
strange i should come across -PRON- again have -PRON- in mind ever since 
on this nearer view minna observe that the woman face bear rather more than a trace of enamel and that the atmosphere about be impregnate with sachet 
-PRON- be not otherwise conspicuous but there be a certain hardness about -PRON- mouth and a certain droop of fatigue in -PRON- eyelid which combine with an indefinite selfconfidence of manner hold attention 
do -PRON- know continue the woman believe -PRON- be in trouble 
i think so when i see -PRON- on the boat and i think so now 
be -PRON- 
be -PRON- in trouble from the country ainot -PRON- 
minna glad to find a sympathiser even in this chance acquaintance admit that -PRON- be in distress that -PRON- have become separate from -PRON- mother and that -PRON- be indeed from the country be try to find a situation -PRON- hazard in conclusion but i donot seem to succeed never be in a city before except bonneville 
well -PRON- a coincidence say the other know i wasnot draw to -PRON- for nothing 
i be look for just such a young girl as -PRON- 
-PRON- see i live alone a good deal and be want to find a nice bright sociable girl who will be a sort of to -PRON- 
understand 
and there s something about -PRON- that i like 
i take to -PRON- the moment i see -PRON- on the boat 
now shall -PRON- talk this over 
towards the end of the week one afternoon as presley be return from -PRON- club -PRON- come suddenly face to face with minna upon a street corner

on division number three of the los muertos ranch the wheat have already be cut and behrman on a certain morning in the first week of august drive across the open expanse of stubble toward the southwest -PRON- eye search the horizon for the feather of smoke that would mark the location of the steam harvester 
however -PRON- see nothing 
the stubble extend onward apparently to the very margin of the world 
at length behrman halt -PRON- buggy and bring out -PRON- field glass from beneath the seat 
-PRON- stand up in -PRON- place and adjust the lense sweep the prospect to the south and west 
-PRON- be the same as though the sea of land be in reality the ocean and -PRON- lose in an open boat be scan the waste through -PRON- glass look for the smoke of a steamer hull down below the horizon 
wonder -PRON- mutter if -PRON- be work on four this morning 
at length -PRON- murmur an ah of satisfaction 
far to the south into the white sheen of sky immediately over the horizon -PRON- make out a faint harvester beyond doubt 
thither behrman turn -PRON- horse head 
-PRON- be all of an hour drive over the uneven ground and through the crackling stubble but at length -PRON- reach the harvester 
-PRON- find however that -PRON- have be halt 
the sack sewer together with the headerman be stretch on the ground in the shade of the machine while the engineer and separatorman be potter about a portion of the work the matter billy demand behrman rein up 
the engineer turn about

-PRON- think -PRON- would better increase the speed of the cupcarrier and pull up to put in a small sprocket 
behrman nod to say that be all right and add a question 
how be -PRON- go

through all these year of confusion bickering open hostility and at last actual warfare -PRON- have wait nurse -PRON- patience calm with the firm assurance of ultimate success 
the end at length have come -PRON- have enter into -PRON- reward and see -PRON- at last instal in the place -PRON- have so long so silently coveted see -PRON- chief of a principality the master of the wheat 
the sprocket adjust the engineer call up the gang and the man take -PRON- place 
the fireman stoke vigorously the two sack sewer resume -PRON- post on the sacking platform put on the goggle that keep the chaff from -PRON- eye 
the separatorman and headerman grip -PRON- lever 
the harvester shoot a column of thick smoke straight upward vibrate to the top of the stack hiss clank and lurch forward 
instantly motion spring to life in all -PRON- component part the header knife cut a thirtysix foot swath gnash like tooth belting slide and move like smooth flowing stream the separator whir the agitator jar and crash cylinder auger fan seeder and elevator draper and chaffcarrier clatter rumble buzz and clang 
the steam hiss and rasp the ground reverberate a hollow note and the thousand upon thousand of wheat stalk slice and slash in the clash shear of the header rattle like dry rush in a hurricane as -PRON- fall inward and be catch up by an endless belt to disappear into the bowel of the vast brute that devour -PRON- 
-PRON- be that and no less 
-PRON- be the feeding of some prodigious monster insatiable with iron tooth gnash and thresh into the field of stand wheat devour always never glut never satiate swallow an entire harvest snarl and slobber in a welter of warm vapour acrid smoke and blind pungent cloud of chaff 
-PRON- move bellydeep in the standing grain a hippopotamus halfmire in river ooze gorging rush snort sweat a dinosaur wallow through thick hot grass flounder there crouch grovel there as -PRON- vast jaw crush and tear and -PRON- enormous gullet swallow incessant ravenous and inordinate 
behrman very much amuse change place with one of the sack sewer allow -PRON- to hold -PRON- horse while -PRON- mount the sacking platform and take -PRON- place 
the trepidation and jostling of the machine shake -PRON- till -PRON- tooth chatter in -PRON- head 
-PRON- ear be shock and assault by a myriadtongue clamour clash steel strain belt jar woodwork while the impalpable chaff powder from the separator settle like dust in -PRON- hair -PRON- ear eye and mouth 
directly in front of where -PRON- sit on the platform be the chute from the cleaner and from this into the mouth of a halffull sack spout an unending gush of grain winnow clean thresh ready for the mill 
the pour from the chute of the cleaner have for behrman an immense satisfaction 
without an instant pause a thick rivulet of wheat roll and dash tumultuous into the sack 
in half a in twenty sack be full be pass over to the second sewer the mouth reeve up and the sack dump out upon the ground to be pick up by the wagon and haul to the railroad 
behrman hypnotise sit watch that river of grain 
all that shriek bellow machinery all that gigantic organism all the month of labour the plough the planting the prayer for rain the year of preparation the heartache the anxiety the foresight all the whole business of the ranch the work of horse of steam of man and boy look to this grain chute from the harvester into the sack 
-PRON- volume be the index of failure or success of rich or poverty 
and at this point the labour of the rancher end 
here at the lip of the chute -PRON- part company with -PRON- grain and from here the wheat stream forth to feed the world 
the yawn mouth of the sack may well stand for the unnumbered mouth of the people all agape for food and here into these sack at first so lean so flaccid attenuate like starve stomach rush the live stream of food insistent interminable fill the empty fattening the shrivel make -PRON- sleek and heavy and solid

presley take from -PRON- room only a few manuscript and notebook and a small valise full of -PRON- personal effect at the doorway -PRON- pause and hold the knob of the door in -PRON- hand look back into the room a very long time 
-PRON- descend to the low floor and enter the diningroom 
mrs derrick have disappear 
presley stand for a long moment in front of the fireplace look about the room remember the scene that -PRON- have witness conference when osterman have first suggest the fight for railroad commissioner and then later the attack on lyman derrick and the sudden revelation of that inconceivable treachery

all the little feminine and contradictory daintiness be nowhere to be see 
-PRON- statuesque calm evenness of contour yet remain but -PRON- be the calmness of great sorrow of infinite resignation 
beautiful -PRON- still remain but -PRON- be old 
the seriousness of one who have gain the knowledge of the of -PRON- to envelope -PRON- 
the calm gravity of a great suffering past but not forget sit upon -PRON-

-PRON- neck be slender the outline of -PRON- full lip and round chin be a little sharp -PRON- arm those wonderful beautiful arm of her be a little shrunken 
but -PRON- eye be as wide open as always rim as ever by the thin intensely black line of the lash and -PRON- brown fragrant hair be still thick still at time glitter and coruscate in the sun 
when -PRON- speak -PRON- be with the oldtime velvety huskiness of voice that annixter have learn to love so well 
oh -PRON- be -PRON- -PRON- say give -PRON- -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be good to want to see -PRON- before -PRON- leave 
i hear that -PRON- be go away 
-PRON- sit down upon the sofa

i be go to take a long ocean voyage 
-PRON- ship sail in a few day 
but -PRON- mrs annixter what be -PRON- go to do

papa be do well 
-PRON- be live here now 
-PRON- be well 
-PRON- make a little helpless gesture with both -PRON- hand smile very sadly 
as -PRON- see -PRON- answer 
as -PRON- talk presley be look at -PRON- intently 
-PRON- dignity be a new element in -PRON- character and the certain slender effect of -PRON- figure emphasise now by the long fold of the black gown -PRON- wear carry -PRON- almost superbly 
-PRON- convey something of the impression of a queen in exile 
but -PRON- have lose none of -PRON- womanliness rather the contrary 
adversity have soften -PRON- as well as deepen -PRON- 
presley see that very clearly 
hilma have arrive now at -PRON- perfect maturity -PRON- have know great love and -PRON- have know great grief and the woman that have awaken in -PRON- with -PRON- affection for annixter have be strengthen and infinitely ennoble by -PRON- death 
what if thing have be different 
thus as -PRON- converse with -PRON- presley find -PRON- wonder 
-PRON- sweetness -PRON- beautiful gentleness and tenderness be almost like palpable presence 
-PRON- be almost as if a caress have be lay softly upon -PRON- cheek as if a gentle hand close upon -PRON- 
here -PRON- know be sympathy here -PRON- know be an infinite capacity for love 
then suddenly all the tired heart of -PRON- go out towards -PRON- 
a longing to give the good that be in -PRON- to the memory of -PRON- to be strong and noble because of -PRON- to reshape -PRON- purposeless halfwaste life with -PRON- nobility and purity and gentleness for -PRON- inspiration leap all at once within -PRON- leap and stand firm harden to a resolve strong than any -PRON- have ever know 
for an instant -PRON- tell -PRON- that the suddenness of this new emotion must be evidence of -PRON- insincerity 
-PRON- be perfectly well aware that -PRON- impulse be abrupt and of short duration 
but -PRON- know that this be not sudden 
without realise -PRON- -PRON- have be from the first draw to hilma and all through these last terrible day since the time -PRON- have see -PRON- at los muertos just after the battle at the ditch -PRON- have obtrude continually upon -PRON- thought 
the sight of -PRON- today more beautiful than ever quiet strong reserve have only bring matter to a culmination 
be -PRON- -PRON- ask -PRON- be -PRON- so unhappy hilma that -PRON- can look forward to no more brightness in -PRON- life 
unless i could -PRON- husband -PRON- answer how can i be happy 
i would rather be unhappy in remember -PRON- than happy in forget -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- whole world literally and truly 
nothing seem to count before i know -PRON- and nothing can count for -PRON- now after i have lose -PRON- 
-PRON- think now -PRON- answer that in be happy again -PRON- would be disloyal to -PRON- 
but -PRON- will find after a from -PRON- nee not be so 
the part of -PRON- that belong to -PRON- husband can always keep -PRON- sacred that part of -PRON- belong to -PRON- and -PRON- to -PRON- 
but -PRON- be young -PRON- have all -PRON- life to live yet 
-PRON- sorrow nee not be a burden to -PRON- 
if -PRON- consider -PRON- as -PRON- -PRON- some day believe will only be a great help to -PRON- 
-PRON- will make -PRON- more noble a truer woman more generous think i see -PRON- answer and i never think about -PRON- in that light before want to help -PRON- -PRON- answer as -PRON- have help -PRON- 
i want to be -PRON- friend and above all thing i do not want to see -PRON- life waste

yes i hope when -PRON- come -PRON- ever will still be that 
i do not know why -PRON- should want to be so kind unlessyes of be -PRON- husband dear friend 
-PRON- talk a little longer and at length presley rise can not bring -PRON- to see mrs derrick again -PRON- say 
-PRON- would only serve to make -PRON- very unhappy 
will -PRON- explain that to -PRON- 
i think -PRON- will understand 
yes answer hilma 
yes i will 
there be a pause 
there seem to be nothing more for either of -PRON- to say 
presley hold out -PRON- hand -PRON- say as -PRON- give -PRON- her 
-PRON- carry -PRON- to -PRON- lip -PRON- answer and may god bless -PRON- 
-PRON- turn away abruptly and leave the room 
but as -PRON- be quietly make -PRON- way out of the house hope to get to -PRON- horse unobserve -PRON- come suddenly upon mrs dyke and sidney on the porch of the house 
-PRON- have forget that since the affair at the ditch los muertos have be a home to the engineer mother and daughter 
and -PRON- mrs dyke -PRON- ask as -PRON- take -PRON- hand in this breakup of everything where do -PRON- go 
to the city -PRON- answer to san francisco 
i have a sister there who will look after the little tad 
but -PRON- how about -PRON- mrs dyke 
-PRON- answer -PRON- in a quiet voice monotonous expressionless be go to die very soon mr presley 
there be no reason why i should live any long 
-PRON- son be in prison for life everything be over for -PRON- and i be tired wear out 
-PRON- mustnot talk like that mrs dyke protest presley nonsense -PRON- will live long enough to see the little tad married 
-PRON- try to be cheerful 
but -PRON- know -PRON- word lack the ring of conviction 
death already overshadow the face of the engineer mother 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- speak the truth and as -PRON- stand there speak to -PRON- for the last time -PRON- arm about little shoulder -PRON- know that -PRON- be see the beginning of the wreck of another family and that like hilda hooven another baby girl be to be start in life through no fault of -PRON- fearfully handicap weigh down at the threshold of existence with a load of disgrace 
hilda hooven and sidney dyke what be to be -PRON- history the one sister of an outcast the other daughter of a convict 
and -PRON- think of that other young girl the little honora gerard the heiress of million pet love receive adulation from all who come near to -PRON- whose only care be to choose from among the multitude of pleasure that the world hasten to present to -PRON- consideration -PRON- say hold out -PRON- hand 
sidney 
-PRON- kiss the little girl clasped mrs hand a moment with -PRON- then sling -PRON- satchel about -PRON- shoulder by the long strap with which -PRON- be provide leave the house and mount -PRON- horse ride away from los muerto never to return 
presley come out upon the county road 
at a little distance to -PRON- left -PRON- could see the group of building where once broderson have live 
these be be remodelle at length to suit the large demand of the new agriculture 
a strange man come out by the road gate no doubt the new proprietor 
presley turn away hurry northward along the county road by the mammoth wateringtank and the long windbreak of poplar 
-PRON- come to place 
there be no change here 
the saloon have weather the storm indispensable to the new as well as to the old regime 
the same dusty buggy and buckboard be tie under the shed and as presley hurry by -PRON- could distinguish voice loud as ever still proclaim -PRON- creed of annihilation 
bonneville presley avoid 
-PRON- have no association with the town 
-PRON- turn aside from the road and cross the northw corner of los muertos and the line of the railroad turn back along the upper road till -PRON- come to the long trestle and desolation abandonment 
a vast stillness profound unbroken brood low over all the place 
no live thing stir 
the rusted windmill on the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well be motionless the great barn empty the window of the ranch house cook house and dairy board up 
nail upon a tree near the broken gateway be a board white paint with stencilled letter bear the inscription warning 
by order and as -PRON- have plan presley reach the hill by the head water of creek late in the afternoon 
toilfully -PRON- climb -PRON- reach the high crest and turn about look long and for the last time at all the reach of the valley unroll beneath -PRON- 
the land of the ranch open out forever and forever under the stimulus of that measureless range of vision 
the whole gigantic sweep of the san joaquin expand titanic before the eye of the mind flagellate with heat quiver and shimmer under the sun red eye 
-PRON- be the season after the harvest and the great earth the mother after -PRON- period of reproduction -PRON- pain of labour deliver of the fruit of -PRON- loin sleep the sleep of exhaustion in the infinite repose of the colossus benignant eternal strong the nourisher of nation the feeder of an entire world 
and as presley look there come to -PRON- strong and true the sense and the significance of all the enigma of growth 
-PRON- seem for one instant to touch the explanation of existence 
man be nothing mere animalculae mere ephemeris that flutter and fall and be forget between dawn and dusk 
vanamee have say there be no death 
but for one second presley could go one step further 
man be naught death be naught life be naught only that bring man into the world that crowd -PRON- out of -PRON- to make way for the succeed generation that make the wheat grow that garner -PRON- from the soil to give place to the succeed crop 
-PRON- be the mystery of creation the stupendous miracle of recreation the vast rhythm of the season measure alternative the sun and the star keep time as the eternal symphony of reproduction swing in -PRON- tremendous cadence like the colossal pendulum of an almighty energy fling out from the hand of the lord god -PRON- immortal calm infinitely strong 
but as -PRON- stand thus look down upon the great valley -PRON- be aware of the figure of a man far in the distance move steadily towards the mission of san juan 
the man be hardly more than a dot but there be something unmistakably familiar in -PRON- gait and besides this presley could fancy that -PRON- be hatless 
-PRON- touch -PRON- pony with -PRON- spur 
the man be vanamee beyond all doubt and a little later presley descend the maze of cowpath and cattletrail that lead down towards the broderson creek overtake -PRON- friend 
instantly presley be aware of an immense change face be still that of an ascetic still glow with the rarefy intelligence of a young seer a halfinspire shepherdprophet of hebraic legend but the shadow of that great sadness which for so long have brood over -PRON- be go the grief that once -PRON- have fancy deathless be indeed dead or rather swallow up in a victorious joy that radiate like sunlight at dawn from the deepset eye and the hollow swarthy cheek 
-PRON- talk together till nearly sundown but to question as to the reason for happiness the other would say nothing 
once only -PRON- allow -PRON- to touch upon the subject 
death and grief be little thing -PRON- say 
-PRON- be transient 
life must be before death and joy before grief 
else there be no such thing as death or grief 
these be only negative 
life be positive 
death be only the absence of life just as night be only the absence of day and if this be so there be no such thing as death 
there be only life and the suppression of life that -PRON- foolishly say be death 
suppression i say not extinction 
i do not say that life return 
life never depart 
life simply for certain season -PRON- be hide in the dark but be that death extinction annihilation 
i take -PRON- thank god that -PRON- be not 
do the grain of wheat hide for certain season in the dark die 
the grain -PRON- think be dead but how 
not as one grain but as twenty 
so all life 
death be only real for all the detritus of the world for all the sorrow for all the injustice for all the grief 
presley the good never die evil die cruelty oppression selfishness die but nobility but love but sacrifice but generosity but truth thank god for -PRON- small as -PRON- be difficult as -PRON- be to discover live forever these be eternal 
-PRON- be all break all cast down by what -PRON- have see in this valley this hopeless struggle this apparently hopeless despair 
well the end be not yet 
what be -PRON- that remain after all be over after the dead be bury and the heart be break 
look at -PRON- all from the vast height of great good to the great number 
what remain 
man perish man be corrupt heart be rent asunder but what remain untouched unassailable undefiled 
try to find that not only in this but in every crisis of the world life and -PRON- will find if -PRON- view be large enough that -PRON- be not evil but good that in the end remain 
there be a long pause 
presley -PRON- mind full of new thought hold -PRON- peace and vanamee add at length believe angele dead 
i weep over -PRON- grave mourn for -PRON- as dead in corruption 
-PRON- have come back to -PRON- more beautiful than ever 
do not ask -PRON- any further 
to put this story this idyl into word would for -PRON- be a profanation 
this must suffice -PRON- 
angele have return to -PRON- and i be happy 
adio 
-PRON- rise suddenly 
the friend clasp each other hand 
-PRON- shall probably never meet again say vanamee but if these be the last word i ever speak to -PRON- listen to -PRON- and remember -PRON- because i know i speak the truth 
evil be shortlive 
never judge of the whole round of life by the mere segment -PRON- can see 
the whole be in the end perfect 
abruptly -PRON- take -PRON- away 
-PRON- be go 
presley alone thoughtful -PRON- hand clasp behind -PRON- pass on through the teem with ripened face set from -PRON- forever 
not so vanamee 
for hour -PRON- roam the countryside now through the desert cluster of building that have once be home now through the rustling and as yet uncut wheat of quien sabe now tread the slope of the hill far to the north and again follow the wind course of the stream 
thus -PRON- spend the night 
at length the day break resplendent cloudless 
the night be pass 
there be all the sparkle and effervescence of joy in the crystal sunlight as the dawn expand roseate and at length flame dazzle to the zenith when the sun move over the edge of the world and look down upon all the earth like the eye of god the father 
at the moment vanamee stand breastdeep in the wheat in a solitary corner of the quien sabe rancho 
-PRON- turn eastward face the celestial glory of the day and send -PRON- voiceless call far from -PRON- across the golden grain out towards the little valley of flower 
swiftly the answer come 
-PRON- advance to meet -PRON- 
the flower of the seed ranch be go dry and parch by the summer sun shed -PRON- seed by handful to be sow again and blossom yet another time 
the seed ranch be no longer royal with colour 
the rose the lily the carnation the hyacinth the poppy the violet the mignonette all these have vanish the little valley be without colour where once -PRON- have exhale the most delicious perfume -PRON- be now odourless 
under the blind light of the day -PRON- stretch to -PRON- hillside bare brown unlovely 
the romance of the place have vanish but with -PRON- have vanish the vision 
-PRON- be no longer a figment of -PRON- imagination a creature of dream that advance to meet vanamee 
-PRON- be be angele in the flesh vital sane material who at last issue forth from the entrance of the little valley 
romance have vanish but well than romance be here 
not a manifestation not a dream but -PRON- very self 
the night be go but the sun have rise the flower have disappear but strong vigorous noble the wheat have come 
in the wheat -PRON- wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- come 
-PRON- be simply dressed 
no fanciful wreath of tuberose be about -PRON- head now no strange garment of red and gold envelop -PRON- now 
-PRON- be no longer an ephemeral illusion of the night evanescent mystic but a simple country girl come to meet -PRON- lover 
the vision of the night have be beautiful but what be -PRON- compare to this 
reality be well than romance 
the simple honesty of a loving trust heart be well than a legend of flower an hallucination of the moonlight 
-PRON- come nearer 
bathe in sunlight -PRON- see -PRON- face to face see -PRON- hair hang in two straight plait on either side of -PRON- face see the enchant fulness of -PRON- lip the strange balancing movement of -PRON- head upon -PRON- slender neck 
but now -PRON- be no longer asleep 
the wonderful eye violet blue heavylidde with -PRON- perplex oriental slant towards the temple be wide open and fix upon -PRON- 
from out the world of romance out of the moonlight and the star sheen out of the faint radiance of the lily and the still air heavy with perfume -PRON- have at last come to -PRON- 
the moonlight the flower and the dream be all vanish away 
angele be realise in the wheat 
-PRON- stand forth in the sunlight a fact and no longer a fancy 
-PRON- run forward to meet -PRON- and -PRON- hold out -PRON- arm to -PRON- 
-PRON- catch -PRON- to -PRON- and -PRON- turn -PRON- face to -PRON- kiss -PRON- on the mouth love -PRON- i love -PRON- -PRON- murmur 
upon descend from -PRON- train at port costa behrman ask to be direct at once to where the bark swanhilda be take on grain 
though -PRON- have buy and greatly enlarge -PRON- new elevator at this port -PRON- have never see -PRON- 
the work have be carry on through agent behrman have far too many and more pressing occupation to demand -PRON- presence and attention 
now however -PRON- be to see the concrete evidence of -PRON- success for the first time 
-PRON- pick -PRON- way across the railroad track to the line of warehouse that border the dock number with enormous roman numeral and full of grain in bag 
the sight of these bag of grain put -PRON- in mind of the fact that among all the other shipper -PRON- be practically alone in -PRON- way of handle -PRON- wheat 
-PRON- handle the grain in bag -PRON- however prefer -PRON- in the bulk 
bag be sometimes four cent apiece and -PRON- have decide to build -PRON- elevator and bulk -PRON- grain therein rather than to incur this expense 
only a small part of -PRON- on number three be sack 
all the rest practically twothird of the entire harvest of los muerto now find -PRON- warehouse in -PRON- enormous elevator at port costa 
to a certain degree -PRON- have be the desire of observe the working of -PRON- system of handle the wheat in bulk that have draw behrman to port costa 
but the more powerful motive have be curiosity not to say downright sentiment 
so long have -PRON- plan for this day of triumph so eagerly have -PRON- look forward to -PRON- that now when -PRON- have come -PRON- wish to enjoy -PRON- to -PRON- full extent wish to miss no feature of the disposal of the crop 
-PRON- have watch -PRON- harvest -PRON- have watch -PRON- haul to the railway and now would watch -PRON- as -PRON- pour into the hold of the ship would even watch the ship as -PRON- clear and get under way 
-PRON- pass through the warehouse and come out upon the dock that run parallel with the shore of the bay 
a great quantity of shipping be in view barque for the most part cape horner great deep sea tramp whose ironshod forefeet have part every ocean the world round from rangoon to rio janeiro and from melbourne to christiania 
some be still in the stream load with wheat to the plimsoll mark ready to depart with the next tide 
but many other lay -PRON- great flank alongside the dock and at that moment be be fill by derrick and crane with thousand upon thousand of bag of wheat 
the scene be brisk the crane creak and swing incessantly with a rattle of chain stevedore and wharfinger toil and perspired boatswain and dockmaster shout order dray rumble the water lap at the pile a group of sailor paint the flank of one of the great ship raise an occasional chanty the trade wind sing aeolian in the cordage fill the air with the nimble taint of salt 
all around be the noise of ship and the feel and flavor of the sea 
behrman soon discover -PRON- elevator 
-PRON- be the large structure discernible and upon -PRON- red roof in enormous white letter be -PRON- own name 
thither between pile of grain bag halt dray crate and box of merchandise with an occasional pyramid of salmon case behrman take -PRON- way 
cable to the dock close under -PRON- elevator lie a great ship with lofty mast and great spar 
-PRON- stern be toward -PRON- as -PRON- approach and upon -PRON- in raise golden letter -PRON- could read the word swanhildaliverpool 
-PRON- go aboard by a very steep gangway and find the mate on the quarter deck 
behrman introduce -PRON- 
well -PRON- add how be -PRON- get on 
very fairly sir return the mate who be an englishman have -PRON- all snug down tight by this time day after tomorrow a great saving of time shunt the stuff in -PRON- like that and three man can do the work of seven have a look round i believe return behrman answer the mate with a nod 
behrman go forward to the hatch that open down into the vast hold of the ship 
a great iron chute connect this hatch with the elevator and through -PRON- be rush a veritable cataract of wheat 
-PRON- come from some gigantic bin within the elevator -PRON- rush down the confine of the chute to plunge into the roomy gloomy interior of the hold with an incessant metallic roar persistent steady inevitable 
no man be in sight 
the place be desert 
no human agency seem to be back of the movement of the wheat 
rather the grain seem impel with a force of -PRON- own a resistless huge force eager vivid impatient for the sea 
behrman stand watch -PRON- ear deafen with the roar of the hard grain against the metallic lining of the chute 
-PRON- put -PRON- hand once into the rushing tide and the contact rasp the flesh of -PRON- finger and like an undertow draw -PRON- hand after -PRON- in -PRON- impetuous dash 
cautiously -PRON- peer down into the hold 
a musty odour rise to -PRON- nostril the vigorous pungent aroma of the raw cereal 
-PRON- be dark 
-PRON- could see nothing but all about and over the opening of the hatch the air be full of a fine impalpable dust that blind the eye and choke the throat and nostril 
as -PRON- eye become use to the shadow of the cavern below -PRON- -PRON- begin to distinguish the grey mass of the wheat a great expanse almost liquid in -PRON- texture which as the cataract from above plunge into -PRON- move and shift in long slow eddy 
as -PRON- stand there this cataract on a sudden increase in volume 
-PRON- turn about cast -PRON- eye upward toward the elevator to discover the cause 
-PRON- foot catch in a coil of rope and -PRON- fall headforemost into the hold 
the fall be a long one and -PRON- strike the surface of the wheat with the sodden impact of a bundle of damp clothe 
for the moment -PRON- be stunned 
all the breath be drive from -PRON- body 
-PRON- could neither move nor cry out 
but by degree -PRON- wit steady -PRON- and -PRON- breath return to -PRON- 
-PRON- look about and above -PRON- 
the daylight in the hold be dim and cloud by the thick chaffdust throw off by the pour of grain and even this dimness dwindle to twilight at a short distance from the opening of the hatch while the remote quarter be lose in impenetrable blackness 
-PRON- get upon -PRON- foot only to find that -PRON- sink ankle deep in the loose pack mass underfoot 
hell -PRON- mutter a fix 
directly underneath the chute the wheat as -PRON- pour in raise -PRON- in a conical mound but from the side of this mound -PRON- shunt away incessantly in thick layer flow in all direction with the nimbleness of water 
even as behrman speak a wave of grain pour around -PRON- leg and rise rapidly to the level of -PRON- knee 
-PRON- step quickly back 
to stay near the chute would soon bury -PRON- to the waist 
no doubt there be some other exit from the hold some companion ladder that lead up to the deck 
-PRON- scuffle and wade across the wheat grope in the dark with outstretche hand 
with every inhalation -PRON- choke fill -PRON- mouth and nostril more with dust than with air 
at time -PRON- could not breathe at all but gag and gasp -PRON- lip distend 
but search as -PRON- would -PRON- could find no outlet to the hold no stairway no companion ladder 
again and again stagger along in the black darkness -PRON- bruise -PRON- knuckle and forehead against the iron side of the ship 
-PRON- give up the attempt to find any interior mean of escape and return laboriously to the space under the open hatchway 
already -PRON- could see that the level of the wheat be raise 
god -PRON- say this isnot go to do at all 
-PRON- utter a great shout 
hello on deck there somebody 
for sake 
the steady metallic roar of the pour wheat drown out -PRON- voice 
-PRON- could scarcely hear -PRON- -PRON- above the rush of the cataract 
besides this -PRON- find -PRON- impossible to stay under the hatch 
the fly grain of wheat spattering as -PRON- fall sting -PRON- face like winddriven particle of ice 
-PRON- be a veritable torture -PRON- hand smart with -PRON- 
once -PRON- be all but blind 
furthermore the succeed wave of wheat roll from the mound under the chute beat -PRON- back swirl and dash against -PRON- leg and knee mount swiftly higher carry -PRON- off -PRON- foot

the horror of death the fear of the trap shake -PRON- like a dry reed 
shout -PRON- tear -PRON- free of the wheat and once more scramble and struggle towards the hatchway 
-PRON- stumble as -PRON- reach -PRON- and fall directly beneath the pour 
like a storm of small shot mercilessly pitilessly the unnumbered multitude of hurtle grain flagellate and beat and tear -PRON- flesh 
blood stream from -PRON- forehead and thickening with the powderlike chaffdust blind -PRON- eye 
-PRON- struggle to -PRON- foot once more

and all the while without stop incessantly inexorably the wheat as if move with a force all -PRON- own shot downward in a prolonged roar persistent steady inevitable 
-PRON- retreat to a far corner of the hold and sit down with -PRON- back against the iron hull of the ship and try to collect -PRON- thought to calm -PRON- 
surely there must be some way of escape surely -PRON- be not to die like this die in this dreadful substance that be neither solid nor fluid 
what be -PRON- to do 
how make -PRON- hear 
but even as -PRON- think about this the cone under the chute break again and send a great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward -PRON- 
-PRON- reach -PRON- where -PRON- sit and bury -PRON- hand and one foot 
-PRON- spring up trembling and make for another corner 
by god -PRON- cry by god i must think of something pretty quick

once more -PRON- retreat 
once more -PRON- crawl staggering to the foot of the cataract scream till -PRON- ear sing and -PRON- eyeball strain in -PRON- socket and once more the relentless tide drive -PRON- back

-PRON- reach -PRON- middle 
furious and with bleed hand and broken nail -PRON- dig -PRON- way out to fall backward all but exhausted gasping for breath in the dustthickened air 
rouse again by the slow advance of the tide -PRON- leap up and stumble away blind with the agony in -PRON- eye only to crash against the metal hull of the vessel 
-PRON- turn about the blood stream from -PRON- face and pause to collect -PRON- sense and with a rush another wave swirl about -PRON- ankle and knee 
exhaustion grow upon -PRON- 
to stand still mean to sink to lie or sit mean to be bury the quicker and all this in the dark all this in an air that could scarcely be breathe all this while -PRON- fight an enemy that could not be grip toil in a sea that could not be stay

once more -PRON- raise -PRON- voice in a shout for help 
-PRON- bleed throat and raw parched lip refuse to utter but a wheeze moan 
once more -PRON- try to look toward the one patch of faint light above -PRON- 
-PRON- eyelid clog with chaff could no longer open 
the wheat pour about -PRON- waist as -PRON- raise -PRON- upon -PRON- knee 
reason flee 
deafen with the roar of the grain blind and make dumb with -PRON- chaff -PRON- throw -PRON- forward with clutch finger roll upon -PRON- back and lie there move feebly the head roll from side to side 
the wheat leap continuously from the chute pour around -PRON-

-PRON- cover the face 
upon the surface of the wheat under the chute nothing move but the wheat -PRON-

a hand fat with short finger and swollen vein reach up clutch then fall limp and prone 
in another instant -PRON- be cover
