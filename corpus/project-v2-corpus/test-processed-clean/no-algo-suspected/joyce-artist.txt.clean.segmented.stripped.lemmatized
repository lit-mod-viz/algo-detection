can -PRON- not have -PRON- opinion whatever -PRON- be without this bad temper and this bad language 
-PRON- be too bad surely 
mrs dedalus speak to dante in a low voice but dante say loudly will not say nothing 
i will defend -PRON- church and -PRON- religion when -PRON- be insult and spit on by renegade catholic 
mr casey push -PRON- plate rudely into the middle of the table and rest -PRON- elbow before -PRON- say in a hoarse voice to -PRON- host tell -PRON- do i tell -PRON- that story about a very famous spit

i be a catholic as -PRON- father be and -PRON- father before -PRON- and -PRON- father before -PRON- again when -PRON- give up -PRON- life rather than sell -PRON- faith

but -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say that -PRON- be a spoiled nun and that -PRON- have come out of the convent in the alleghanie when -PRON- brother have get the money from the savage for the trinket and the chainie 
perhaps that make -PRON- severe against parnell

-PRON- be not nice about the spit in the woman eye 
but what be the name the woman have call kitty oshea that mr casey would not repeat 
-PRON- think of mr casey walk through the crowd of people and make speech from a wagonette 
that be what -PRON- have be in prison for and -PRON- remember that one night sergeant oneill have come to the house and have stand in the hall talk in a low voice with -PRON- father and chew nervously at the chinstrap of -PRON- cap 
and that night mr casey have not go to dublin by train but a car have come to the door and -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say something about the cabinteely road

and that s why -PRON- run away if -PRON- want to know 
and the fellow who have speak first say yes that s what i hear too from the fellow in the high line 
the fellow all be silent 
stephen stand among -PRON- afraid to speak listening 
a faint sickness of awe make -PRON- feel weak 
how could -PRON- have do that 
-PRON- think of the dark silent sacristy 
there be dark wooden press there where the crimped surplice lie quietly fold 
-PRON- be not the chapel but still -PRON- have to speak under -PRON- breath 
-PRON- be a holy place 
-PRON- remember the summer evening -PRON- have be there to be dress as boatbearer the evening of the procession to the little altar in the wood 
a strange and holy place 
the boy that hold the censer have swing -PRON- gently to and fro near the door with the silvery cap lift by the middle chain to keep the coal light 
that be call charcoal and -PRON- have burn quietly as the fellow have swing -PRON- gently and have give off a weak sour smell 
and then when all be vest -PRON- have stand hold out the boat to the rector and the rector have put a spoonful of incense in -PRON- and -PRON- have hiss on the red coal 
the fellow be talk together in little group here and there on the playground 
the fellow seem to -PRON- to have grow small that be because a sprinter have knock -PRON- down the day before a fellow out of second of grammar 
-PRON- have be throw by the fellow machine lightly on the cinderpath and -PRON- spectacle have be break in three piece and some of the grit of the cinder have go into -PRON- mouth 
that be why the fellow seem to -PRON- small and farther away and the goalpost so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up 
but there be no play on the football ground for cricket be come and some say that barne would be prof and some say -PRON- would be flower 
and all over the playground -PRON- be play rounder and bowl twister and lob 
and from here and from there come the sound of the cricket bat through the soft grey air 
-PRON- say pick pack pock puck little drop of water in a fountain slowly fall in the brimming bowl 
athy who have be silent say quietly -PRON- be all wrong 
all turn towards -PRON- eagerly 
why 
do -PRON- know 
who tell -PRON- 
tell -PRON- athy 
athy point across the playground to where simon moonan be walk by -PRON- kick a stone before -PRON- 
ask -PRON- -PRON- say 
the fellow look there and then say why -PRON-

i will tell -PRON- but -PRON- must not let on -PRON- know 
tell -PRON- athy 
go on 
-PRON- may if -PRON- know 
-PRON- pause for a moment and then say mysteriously -PRON- be catch with simon moonan and tusker boyle in the square one night 
the fellow look at -PRON- and ask catch 
what do 
athy say smugge 
all the fellow be silent and athy say and that s why 
stephen look at the face of the fellow but -PRON- be all look across the playground 
-PRON- want to ask somebody about -PRON- 
what do that mean about the smugging in the square 
why do the five fellow out of the high line run away for that 
-PRON- be a joke -PRON- think 
simon moonan have nice clothe and one night -PRON- have show -PRON- a ball of creamy sweet that the fellow of the football fifteen have roll down to -PRON- along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when -PRON- be at the door 
-PRON- be the night of the match against the bective ranger and the ball be make just like a red and green apple only -PRON- open and -PRON- be full of the creamy sweet 
and one day boyle have say that an elephant have two tusker instead of two tusk and that be why -PRON- be call tusker boyle but some fellow call -PRON- lady boyle because -PRON- be always at -PRON- nail pare -PRON- 
eileen have long thin cool white hand too because -PRON- be a girl 
-PRON- be like ivory only soft 
that be the meaning of tower of ivory but protestant could not understand -PRON- and make fun of -PRON- 
one day -PRON- have stand beside -PRON- look into the hotel ground 
a waiter be run up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier be scamper to and fro on the sunny lawn 
-PRON- have put -PRON- hand into -PRON- pocket where -PRON- hand be and -PRON- have feel how cool and thin and soft -PRON- hand be 
-PRON- have say that pocket be funny thing to have and then all of a sudden -PRON- have break away and have run laugh down the slope curve of the path 
-PRON- fair hair have stream out behind -PRON- like gold in the sun 
tower of ivory 
house of gold by think of thing -PRON- could understand -PRON- 
but why in the square 
-PRON- go there when -PRON- want to do something 
-PRON- be all thick slab of slate and water trickle all day out of tiny pinhole and there be a queer smell of stale water there 
and behind the door of one of the closet there be a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath be the name of the drawing balbus be build a wall some fellow have draw -PRON- there for a cod 
-PRON- have a funny face but -PRON- be very like a man with a beard 
and on the wall of another closet there be write in backhand in beautiful writing julius csar write the calico belly perhaps that be why -PRON- be there because -PRON- be a place where some fellow write thing for cod 
but all the same -PRON- be queer what athy say and the way -PRON- say -PRON- 
-PRON- be not a cod because -PRON- have run away 
-PRON- look with the other across the playground and begin to feel afraid 
at last fleming say and -PRON- be all to be punish for what other fellow do wonot come back see if i do cecil thunder say 
three day silence in the refectory and send -PRON- up for six and eight every minute 
yes say well 
and old barrett have a new way of twist the note so that -PRON- canot open -PRON- and fold -PRON- again to see how many ferul -PRON- be to get 
i wonot come back too 
yes say cecil thunder and the prefect of study be in second of grammar this morning 
let -PRON- get up a rebellion fleming say 
will -PRON- 
all the fellow be silent 
the air be very silent and -PRON- could hear the cricket bat but more slowly than before pick pock 
well ask what be go to be do to -PRON- 
simon moonan and tusker be go to be flog athy say and the fellow in the high line get -PRON- choice of flog or be expel 
and which be -PRON- take ask the fellow who have speak first 
all be take expulsion except corrigan athy answer go to be flog by mr gleeson know why cecil thunder say 
-PRON- be right and the other fellow be wrong because a flogging wear off after a bit but a fellow that have be expel from college be know all -PRON- life on account of -PRON- 
besides gleeson wonot flog -PRON- hard good of -PRON- play not to fleme say wouldnot like to be simon moonan and tusker cecil thunder say 
but i donot believe -PRON- will be flog 
perhaps -PRON- will be send up for twice nine 
no no say athy both get -PRON- on the vital spot 
well rub -PRON- and say in a cry voice please sir let -PRON- off 
athy grin and turn up the sleeve of -PRON- jacket say -PRON- canot be help -PRON- must be do 
so down with -PRON- breech and out with -PRON- bum 
the fellow laugh but -PRON- feel that -PRON- be a little afraid 
in the silence of the soft grey air -PRON- hear the cricket bat from here and from there pock 
that be a sound to hear but if -PRON- be hit then -PRON- would feel a pain 
the pandybat make a sound too but not like that 
the fellow say -PRON- be make of whalebone and leather with lead inside and -PRON- wonder what be the pain like 
there be different kind of sound 
a long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and -PRON- wonder what be that pain like 
-PRON- make -PRON- shivery to think of -PRON- and cold and what athy say too 
but what be there to laugh at in -PRON- 
-PRON- make -PRON- shivery but that be because -PRON- always feel like a shiver when -PRON- let down -PRON- trouser 
-PRON- be the same in the bath when -PRON- undress -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder who have to let -PRON- down the master or the boy -PRON- how could -PRON- laugh about -PRON- that way 
-PRON- look at rolledup sleeve and knuckly inky hand 
-PRON- have roll up -PRON- sleeve to show how mr gleeson would roll up -PRON- sleeve 
but mr gleeson have round shiny cuff and clean white wrist and fattish white hand and the nail of -PRON- be long and pointed 
perhaps -PRON- pare -PRON- too like lady boyle 
but -PRON- be terribly long and pointed nail 
so long and cruel -PRON- be though the white fattish hand be not cruel but gentle 
and though -PRON- tremble with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nail and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill -PRON- feel at the end of -PRON- shirt when -PRON- undress -PRON- yet -PRON- feel a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside -PRON- to think of the white fattish hand clean and strong and gentle 
and -PRON- think of what cecil thunder have say that mr gleeson would not flog corrigan hard 
and fleming have say -PRON- would not because -PRON- be good of -PRON- play not to 
but that be not why 
a voice from far out on the playground cry all in 
and other voice cry all in 
all in 
during the writing lesson -PRON- sit with -PRON- arm fold listening to the slow scraping of the pen 
mr harford go to and fro make little sign in red pencil and sometimes sit beside the boy to show -PRON- how to hold -PRON- pen 
-PRON- have try to spell out the headline for -PRON- though -PRON- know already what -PRON- be for -PRON- be the last of the book 
zeal without prudence be like a ship adrift but the line of the letter be like fine invisible thread and -PRON- be only by close -PRON- right eye tight and stare out of the left eye that -PRON- could make out the full curve of the capital 
but mr harford be very decent and never get into a wax 
all the other master get into dreadful wax 
but why be -PRON- to suffer for what fellow in the high line do 
well have say that -PRON- have drink some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that -PRON- have be find out who have do -PRON- by the smell 
perhaps -PRON- have steal a monstrance to run away with and sell -PRON- somewhere 
that must have be a terrible sin to go in there quietly at night to open the dark press and steal the flash gold thing into which god be put on the altar in the middle of flower and candle at benediction while the incense go up in cloud at both side as the fellow swing the censer and dominic kelly sing the first part by -PRON- in the choir 
but god be not in -PRON- of course when -PRON- steal -PRON- 
but still -PRON- be a strange and a great sin even to touch -PRON- 
-PRON- think of -PRON- with deep awe a terrible and strange sin -PRON- thrill -PRON- to think of -PRON- in the silence when the pen scrape lightly 
but to drink the altar wine out of the press and be find out by the smell be a sin too but -PRON- be not terrible and strange 
-PRON- only make -PRON- feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine 
because on the day when -PRON- have make -PRON- first holy communion in the chapel -PRON- have shut -PRON- eye and open -PRON- mouth and put out -PRON- tongue a little and when the rector have stoop down to give -PRON- the holy communion -PRON- have smell a faint winy smell off the rector breath after the wine of the mass 
the word be beautiful wine 
-PRON- make -PRON- think of dark purple because the grape be dark purple that grow in greece outside house like white temple 
but the faint smell of the rector breath have make -PRON- feel a sick feeling on the morning of -PRON- first communion 
the day of -PRON- first communion be the happy day of -PRON- life 
and once a lot of general have ask napoleon what be the happy day of -PRON- life 
-PRON- think -PRON- would say the day -PRON- win some great battle or the day -PRON- be make an emperor 
but -PRON- say gentleman the happy day of -PRON- life be the day on which i make -PRON- first holy communion 
father arnall come in and the latin lesson begin and -PRON- remain still lean on the desk with -PRON- arm fold 
father arnall give out the themebook and -PRON- say that -PRON- be scandalous and that -PRON- be all to be write out again with the correction at once 
but the bad of all be theme because the page be stick together by a blot and father arnall hold -PRON- up by a corner and say -PRON- be an insult to any master to send -PRON- up such a theme 
then -PRON- ask jack lawton to decline the noun mare and jack lawton stop at the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural 
-PRON- should be ashamed of -PRON- say father arnall sternly 
-PRON- the leader of the class 
then -PRON- ask the next boy and the next and the next 
nobody know 
father arnall become very quiet more and more quiet as each boy try to answer -PRON- and could not 
but -PRON- face be blacklooke and -PRON- eye be stare though -PRON- voice be so quiet 
then -PRON- ask fleme and fleming say that the word have no plural 
father arnall suddenly shut the book and shout at -PRON- kneel out there in the middle of the class 
-PRON- be one of the idle boy i ever meet 
copy out -PRON- theme again the rest of -PRON- 
fleming move heavily out of -PRON- place and knelt between the two last bench 
the other boy bend over -PRON- themebook and begin to write 
a silence fill the classroom and stephen glance timidly at father dark face see that -PRON- be a little red from the wax -PRON- be in 
be that a sin for father arnall to be in a wax or be -PRON- allow to get into a wax when the boy be idle because that make -PRON- study better or be -PRON- only let on to be in a wax 
-PRON- be because -PRON- be allow because a priest would know what a sin be and would not do -PRON- 
but if -PRON- do -PRON- one time by mistake what would -PRON- do to go to confession 
perhaps -PRON- would go to confession to the minister 
and if the minister do -PRON- -PRON- would go to the rector and the rector to the provincial and the provincial to the general of the jesuit 
that be call the order and -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say that -PRON- be all clever man 
-PRON- could all have become highup people in the world if -PRON- have not become jesuit 
and -PRON- wonder what father arnall and paddy barrett would have become and what mr and mr gleeson would have become if -PRON- have not become jesuit 
-PRON- be hard to think what because -PRON- would have to think of -PRON- in a different way with different coloured coat and trouser and with beard and moustache and different kind of hat 
the door open quietly and closed 
a quick whisper run through the class the prefect of study 
there be an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk heart leap up in fear 
any boy want flog here father arnall cry the prefect of study 
any lazy idle loafer that want flog in this class 
-PRON- come to the middle of the class and see fleme on -PRON- knee

kneel down cry the prefect of study 
fleme knelt down squeeze -PRON- hand under -PRON- armpit -PRON- face contort with pain but stephen know how hard -PRON- hand be because fleming be always rub rosin into -PRON- 
but perhaps -PRON- be in great pain for the noise of the pandybat be terrible heart be beat and flutter 
at -PRON- work all of -PRON- shout the prefect of study 
-PRON- want no lazy idle loafer here lazy idle little schemer

stephen lift -PRON- eye in wonder and see for a moment father whitegrey not young face -PRON- baldy whitegrey head with fluff at the side of -PRON- the steel rim of -PRON- spectacle and -PRON- nocoloure eye look through the glass 
why do -PRON- say -PRON- know that trick 
lazy idle little loafer cry the prefect of study 
break -PRON- glass 
an old schoolboy trick 
out with -PRON- hand this moment 
stephen close -PRON- eye and hold out in the air -PRON- trembling hand with the palm upwards 
-PRON- feel the prefect of study touch -PRON- for a moment at the finger to straighten -PRON- and then the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat be lift to strike 
a hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a break stick make -PRON- trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire and at the sound and the pain scalding tear be drive into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- whole body be shake with fright -PRON- arm be shake and -PRON- crumple burn livid hand shake like a loose leaf in the air 
a cry spring to -PRON- lip a prayer to be let off 
but though the tear scald -PRON- eye and -PRON- limb quiver with pain and fright -PRON- hold back the hot tear and the cry that scald -PRON- throat 
other hand shout the prefect of study 
stephen draw back -PRON- maimed and quiver right arm and hold out -PRON- left hand 
the soutane sleeve swish again as the pandybat be lift and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingle burn pain make -PRON- hand shrink together with the palm and finger in a livid quivering mass 
the scald water burst forth from -PRON- eye and burn with shame and agony and fear -PRON- draw back -PRON- shake arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain 
-PRON- body shake with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage -PRON- feel the scald cry come from -PRON- throat and the scalding tear fall out of -PRON- eye and down -PRON- flaming cheek 
kneel down cry the prefect of study 
stephen knelt down quickly press -PRON- beat hand to -PRON- side 
to think of -PRON- beat and swell with pain all in a moment make -PRON- feel so sorry for -PRON- as if -PRON- be not -PRON- own but someone else that -PRON- feel sorry for 
and as -PRON- kneel calm the last sob in -PRON- throat and feel the burn tingle pain press into -PRON- side -PRON- think of the hand which -PRON- have hold out in the air with the palm up and of the firm touch of the prefect of study when -PRON- have steady the shake finger and of the beat swollen redden mass of palm and finger that shake helplessly in the air 
get at -PRON- work all of -PRON- cry the prefect of study from the door

the door close behind -PRON- 
the hush class continue to copy out the theme 
father arnall rise from -PRON- seat and go among -PRON- help the boy with gentle word and tell -PRON- the mistake -PRON- have make 
-PRON- voice be very gentle and soft 
then -PRON- return to -PRON- seat and say to fleme and stephen -PRON- may return to -PRON- place -PRON- two 
fleming and stephen rise and walk to -PRON- seat sit down 
stephen scarlet with shame open a book quickly with one weak hand and bend down upon -PRON- -PRON- face close to the page 
-PRON- be unfair and cruel because the doctor have tell -PRON- not to read without glass and -PRON- have write home to -PRON- father that morning to send -PRON- a new pair 
and father arnall have say that -PRON- nee not study till the new glass come 
then to be call a schemer before the class and to be pandy when -PRON- always get the card for first or second and be the leader of the yorkist 
how could the prefect of study know that -PRON- be a trick 
-PRON- feel the touch of the prefect finger as -PRON- have steady -PRON- hand and at first -PRON- have think -PRON- be go to shake hand with -PRON- because the finger be soft and firm but then in an instant -PRON- have hear the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash

-PRON- listen to father low and gentle voice as -PRON- correct the theme 
perhaps -PRON- be sorry now and want to be decent 
but -PRON- be unfair and cruel 
the prefect of study be a priest but that be cruel and unfair 
and -PRON- whitegrey face and the nocoloure eye behind the steel rim spectacle be cruel look because -PRON- have steady the hand first with -PRON- firm soft finger and that be to hit -PRON- better and louder a stink mean thing that s what -PRON- be say fleme in the corridor as the class be pass out in file to the refectory to pandy a fellow for what be not -PRON- fault

and there be some fellow out of second of grammar listening and one of -PRON- say the senate and the roman people declare that dedalus have be wrongly punish 
-PRON- be wrong -PRON- be unfair and cruel and as -PRON- sit in the refectory -PRON- suffer time after time in memory the same humiliation until -PRON- begin to wonder whether -PRON- may not really be that there be something in -PRON- face which make -PRON- look like a schemer and -PRON- wish -PRON- have a little mirror to see 
but there could not be and -PRON- be unjust and cruel and unfair 
-PRON- could not eat the blackish fish fritter -PRON- get on wednesday in lent and one of -PRON- potato have the mark of the spade in -PRON- 
yes -PRON- would do what the fellow have tell -PRON- 
-PRON- would go up and tell the rector that -PRON- have be wrongly punish 
a thing like that have be do before by somebody in history by some great person whose head be in the book of history 
and the rector would declare that -PRON- have be wrongly punish because the senate and the roman people always declare that the man who do that have be wrongly punish 
those be the great man whose name be in richmal question 
history be all about those man and what -PRON- do and that be what peter tale about greece and rome be all about 
peter parley -PRON- be on the first page in a picture 
there be a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bush and peter parley have a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and -PRON- be walk fast along the road to greece and rome 
-PRON- be easy what -PRON- have to do 
all -PRON- have to do be when the dinner be over and -PRON- come out in -PRON- turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that lead to the castle 
-PRON- have nothing to do but that to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute -PRON- would be in the low dark narrow corridor that lead through the castle to the rector room 
and every fellow have say that -PRON- be unfair even the fellow out of second of grammar who have say that about the senate and the roman people 
what would happen 
-PRON- hear the fellow of the high line stand up at the top of the refectory and hear -PRON- step as -PRON- come down the mat paddy rath and jimmy magee and the spaniard and the portuguese and the fifth be big corrigan who be go to be flog by mr gleeson 
that be why the prefect of study have call -PRON- a schemer and pandy -PRON- for nothing and strain -PRON- weak eye tired with the tear -PRON- watch big broad shoulder and big hang black head pass in the file 
but -PRON- have do something and besides mr gleeson would not flog -PRON- hard and -PRON- remember how big corrigan look in the bath 
-PRON- have skin the same colour as the turfcoloure bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when -PRON- walk along the side -PRON- foot slap loudly on the wet tile and at every step -PRON- thigh shake a little because -PRON- be fat 
the refectory be half empty and the fellow be still pass out in file 
-PRON- could go up the staircase because there be never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door 
but -PRON- could not go 
the rector would side with the prefect of study and think -PRON- be a schoolboy trick and then the prefect of study would come in every day the same only -PRON- would be bad because -PRON- would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow go up to the rector about -PRON- 
the fellow have tell -PRON- to go but -PRON- would not go -PRON- 
-PRON- have forget all about -PRON- 
no -PRON- be good to forget all about -PRON- and perhaps the prefect of study have only say -PRON- would come in 
no -PRON- be good to hide out of the way because when -PRON- be small and young -PRON- could often escape that way 
the fellow at -PRON- table stand up 
-PRON- stand up and pass out among -PRON- in the file 
-PRON- have to decide 
-PRON- be come near the door 
if -PRON- go on with the fellow -PRON- could never go up to the rector because -PRON- could not leave the playground for that 
and if -PRON- go and be pandy all the same all the fellow would make fun and talk about young dedalus go up to the rector to tell on the prefect of study 
-PRON- be walk down along the matting and -PRON- see the door before -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible -PRON- could not 
-PRON- think of the baldy head of the prefect of study with the cruel nocoloure eye look at -PRON- and -PRON- hear the voice of the prefect of study ask -PRON- twice what -PRON- name be 
why could -PRON- not remember the name when -PRON- be tell the first time 
be -PRON- not listen the first time or be -PRON- to make fun out of the name 
the great man in the history have name like that and nobody make fun of -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- own name that -PRON- should have make fun of if -PRON- want to make fun 
dolan -PRON- be like the name of a woman who wash clothe 
-PRON- have reach the door and turn quickly up to the right walk up the stair and before -PRON- could make up -PRON- mind to come back -PRON- have enter the low dark narrow corridor that lead to the castle 
and as -PRON- cross the threshold of the door of the corridor -PRON- see without turn -PRON- head to look that all the fellow be look after -PRON- as -PRON- go file by 
-PRON- pass along the narrow dark corridor pass little door that be the door of the room of the community 
-PRON- peer in front of -PRON- and right and leave through the gloom and think that those must be portrait 
-PRON- be dark and silent and -PRON- eye be weak and tired with tear so that -PRON- could not see 
but -PRON- think -PRON- be the portrait of the saint and great man of the order who be look down on -PRON- silently as -PRON- pass saint ignatius loyola hold an open book and point to the word ad majorem dei gloriam in -PRON- saint francis xavier point to -PRON- chest lorenzo ricci with -PRON- berretta on -PRON- head like one of the prefect of the line the three patron of holy youth saint stanislaus kostka saint aloysius gonzago and bless john berchman all with young face because -PRON- die when -PRON- be young and father peter kenny sit in a chair wrap in a big cloak 
-PRON- come out on the landing above the entrance hall and look about -PRON- 
that be where hamilton rowan have pass and the mark of the soldier slug be there 
and -PRON- be there that the old servant have see the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal 
an old servant be sweep at the end of the landing 
-PRON- ask -PRON- where be the rector room and the old servant point to the door at the far end and look after -PRON- as -PRON- go on to -PRON- and knock 
there be no answer 
-PRON- knock again more loudly and -PRON- heart jump when -PRON- hear a muffled voice say come in 
-PRON- turn the handle and open the door and fumble for the handle of the green baize door inside 
-PRON- find -PRON- and push -PRON- open and go in 
-PRON- see the rector sit at a desk writing 
there be a skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of chair 
-PRON- heart be beat fast on account of the solemn place -PRON- be in and the silence of the room and -PRON- look at the skull and at the rector kindlooke face

the rector look at -PRON- in silence and -PRON- could feel the blood rise to -PRON- face and the tear about to rise to -PRON- eye 
the rector say -PRON- name be dedalus isnot -PRON- 
yes sir

stephen feel the tear wet -PRON- eye and murmur yes sir thank 
the rector hold -PRON- hand across the side of the desk where the skull be and stephen place -PRON- hand in -PRON- for a moment feel a cool moist palm 
good day now say the rector withdraw -PRON- hand and bowing 
good day sir say stephen 
-PRON- bow and walk quietly out of the room close the door carefully and slowly 
but when -PRON- have pass the old servant on the landing and be again in the low narrow dark corridor -PRON- begin to walk faster and faster 
faster and faster -PRON- hurry on through the gloom excitedly 
-PRON- bump -PRON- elbow against the door at the end and hurry down the staircase walk quickly through the two corridor and out into the air 
-PRON- could hear the cry of the fellow on the playground 
-PRON- break into a run and run quicker and quicker run across the cinderpath and reach the third line playground pant 
the fellow have see -PRON- run 
-PRON- close round -PRON- in a ring push one against another to hear

-PRON- catch -PRON- cap and send -PRON- up again spin skyhigh and cry again hurroo 
hurroo 
-PRON- make a cradle of -PRON- lock hand and hoist -PRON- up among -PRON- and carry -PRON- along till -PRON- struggle to get free 
and when -PRON- have escape from -PRON- -PRON- break away in all direction fling -PRON- cap again into the air and whistle as -PRON- go spin up and cry hurroo 
and -PRON- give three groan for baldyhead dolan and three cheer for conmee and -PRON- say -PRON- be the decent rector that be ever in clongowes 
the cheer die away in the soft grey air 
-PRON- be alone 
-PRON- be happy and free but -PRON- would not be anyway proud with father dolan 
-PRON- would be very quiet and obedient and -PRON- wish that -PRON- could do something kind for -PRON- to show -PRON- that -PRON- be not proud 
the air be soft and grey and mild and evening be come 
there be the smell of evening in the air the smell of the field in the country where -PRON- digge up turnip to peel -PRON- and eat -PRON- when -PRON- go out for a walk to major the smell there be in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnut be 
the fellow be practise long shy and bowl lob and slow twister 
in the soft grey silence -PRON- could hear the bump of the ball and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the cricket bat pick pack pock puck like drop of water in a fountain fall softly in the brimming bowl 
chapter uncle charle smoke such black twist that at last -PRON- nephew suggest to -PRON- to enjoy -PRON- morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden 
very good simon 
all serene simon say the old man tranquilly 
anywhere -PRON- like 
the outhouse will do -PRON- nicely -PRON- will be more salubrious 
damn -PRON- say mr dedalus frankly if i know how -PRON- can smoke such villainous awful tobacco like gunpowder by god very nice simon reply the old man 
very cool and mollify 
every morning therefore uncle charle repair to -PRON- outhouse but not before -PRON- have grease and brush scrupulously -PRON- back hair and brush and put on -PRON- tall hat 
while -PRON- smoke the brim of -PRON- tall hat and the bowl of -PRON- pipe be just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door 
-PRON- arbour as -PRON- call the reek outhouse which -PRON- share with the cat and the garden tool serve -PRON- also as a soundingbox and every morning -PRON- hum contentedly one of -PRON- favourite song twine -PRON- a bower or blue eye and golden hair or the grove of blarney while the grey and blue coil of smoke rise slowly from -PRON- pipe and vanish in the pure air 
during the first part of the summer in blackrock uncle charle be constant companion 
uncle charle be a hale old man with a well tan skin rugge feature and white side whisker 
on week day -PRON- do message between the house in carysfort avenue and those shop in the main street of the town with which the family deal 
stephen be glad to go with -PRON- on these errand for uncle charle help -PRON- very liberally to handful of whatever be expose in open box and barrel outside the counter 
-PRON- would seize a handful of grape and sawdust or three or four american apple and thrust -PRON- generously into -PRON- grandnephews hand while the shopman smile uneasily and on feign reluctance to take -PRON- -PRON- would frown and say take -PRON- sir 
do -PRON- hear -PRON- sir good for -PRON- bowel 
when the order list have be book the two would go on to the park where an old friend of father mike flynn would be find seat on a bench wait for -PRON- 
then would begin run round the park 
mike flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station watch in hand while stephen run round the track in the style mike flynn favour -PRON- head high lift -PRON- knee well lift and -PRON- hand hold straight down by -PRON- side 
when the morning practice be over the trainer would make -PRON- comment and sometimes illustrate -PRON- by shuffle along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoe 
a small ring of wonderstruck child and nursemaid would gather to watch -PRON- and linger even when -PRON- and uncle charle have sit down again and be talk athletic and politic 
though -PRON- have hear -PRON- father say that mike flynn have put some of the good runner of modern time through -PRON- hand stephen often glance at -PRON- trainer flabby stubblecovered face as -PRON- bend over the long stain finger through which -PRON- roll -PRON- cigarette and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eye which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen finger cease -PRON- rolling and grain and fibre of tobacco fall back into the pouch 
on the way home uncle charle would often pay a visit to the chapel and as the font be above reach the old man would dip -PRON- hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about clothe and on the floor of the porch 
while -PRON- pray -PRON- kneel on -PRON- red handkerchief and read above -PRON- breath from a thumb blacken prayerbook wherein catchword be print at the foot of every page 
stephen knelt at -PRON- side respect though -PRON- do not share -PRON- piety 
-PRON- often wonder what -PRON- granduncle pray for so seriously 
perhaps -PRON- pray for the soul in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps -PRON- pray that god may send -PRON- back a part of the big fortune -PRON- have squander in cork 
on sunday stephen with -PRON- father and -PRON- granduncle take -PRON- constitutional 
the old man be a nimble walker in spite of -PRON- corn and often ten or twelve mile of the road be cover 
the little village of stillorgan be the parting of the way 
either -PRON- go to the left towards the dublin mountain or along the goatstown road and thence into dundrum come home by sandyford 
trudge along the road or stand in some grimy wayside public house -PRON- elder speak constantly of the subject nearer -PRON- heart of irish politic of munster and of the legend of -PRON- own family to all of which stephen lend an avid ear 
word which -PRON- do not understand -PRON- say over and over to -PRON- till -PRON- have learn -PRON- by heart and through -PRON- -PRON- have glimpse of the real world about -PRON- 
the hour when -PRON- too would take part in the life of that world seem draw near and in secret -PRON- begin to make ready for the great part which -PRON- feel await -PRON- the nature of which -PRON- only dimly apprehend 
-PRON- evening be -PRON- own and -PRON- pore over a ragged translation of the count of monte cristo 
the figure of that dark avenger stand forth in -PRON- mind for whatever -PRON- have hear or divine in childhood of the strange and terrible 
at night -PRON- build up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave out of transfer and paper flower and coloured tissue paper and strip of the silver and golden paper in which chocolate be wrap 
when -PRON- have break up this scenery weary of -PRON- tinsel there would come to -PRON- mind the bright picture of marseille of sunny trellis and of mercede 
outside blackrock on the road that lead to the mountain stand a small whitewash house in the garden of which grow many rosebush and in this house -PRON- tell -PRON- another mercede live 
both on the outward and on the homeward journey -PRON- measure distance by this landmark and in -PRON- imagination -PRON- live through a long train of adventure marvellous as those in the book -PRON- towards the close of which there appear an image of -PRON- grow old and sadder stand in a moonlit garden with mercede who have so many year before slight -PRON- love and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal say madam i never eat muscatel grape 
-PRON- become the ally of a boy name aubrey mill and found with -PRON- a gang of adventurer in the avenue 
aubrey carry a whistle dangle from -PRON- buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attach to -PRON- belt while the other have short stick thrust daggerwise through -PRON- 
stephen who have read of plain style of dress choose to remain unadorned and thereby heighten for -PRON- the pleasure of take counsel with -PRON- lieutenant before give order 
the gang make foray into the garden of old maid or go down to the castle and fight a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rock come home after -PRON- weary straggler with the stale odour of the foreshore in -PRON- nostril and the rank oil of the seawrack upon -PRON- hand and in -PRON- hair 
aubrey and stephen have a common milkman and often -PRON- drive out in the milkcar to carrickmine where the cow be at grass 
while the man be milk the boy would take turn in ride the tractable mare round the field 
but when autumn come the cow be drive home from the grass and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at stradbrook with -PRON- foul green puddle and clot of liquid dung and steam bran trough sicken heart 
the cattle which have seem so beautiful in the country on sunny day revolt -PRON- and -PRON- could not even look at the milk -PRON- yield 
the coming of september do not trouble -PRON- this year for -PRON- be not to be send back to clongowes 
the practice in the park come to an end when mike flynn go into hospital 
aubrey be at school and have only an hour or two free in the evening 
the gang fall asunder and there be no more nightly foray or battle on the rock 
stephen sometimes go round with the car which deliver the evening milk and these chilly drive blow away -PRON- memory of the filth of the cowyard and -PRON- feel no repugnance at see the cow hair and hayseed on the milkman coat 
whenever the car draw up before a house -PRON- wait to catch a glimpse of a well scrub kitchen or of a softly light hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how -PRON- would close the door 
-PRON- think -PRON- should be a pleasant life enough driving along the road every evening to deliver milk if -PRON- have warm glove and a fat bag of gingernut in -PRON- pocket to eat from 
but the same foreknowledge which have sicken -PRON- heart and make -PRON- leg sag suddenly as -PRON- race round the park the same intuition which have make -PRON- glance with mistrust at -PRON- trainer flabby stubblecovered face as -PRON- bend heavily over -PRON- long stained finger dissipate any vision of the future 
in a vague way -PRON- understand that -PRON- father be in trouble and that this be the reason why -PRON- -PRON- have not be send back to clongowes 
for some time -PRON- have feel the slight change in -PRON- house and those change in what -PRON- have deem unchangeable be so many slight shock to -PRON- boyish conception of the world 
the ambition which -PRON- feel astir at time in the darkness of -PRON- soul seek no outlet 
a dusk like that of the outer world obscure -PRON- mind as -PRON- hear the mare hoof clatter along the tramtrack on the rock road and the great can sway and rattle behind -PRON- 
-PRON- return to mercede and as -PRON- brood upon -PRON- image a strange unrest creep into -PRON- blood 
sometimes a fever gather within -PRON- and lead -PRON- to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue 
the peace of the garden and the kindly light in the window pour a tender influence into -PRON- restless heart 
the noise of child at play annoy -PRON- and -PRON- silly voice make -PRON- feel even more keenly than -PRON- have feel at clongowes that -PRON- be different from other 
-PRON- do not want to play 
-PRON- want to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which -PRON- soul so constantly behold 
-PRON- do not know where to seek -PRON- or how but a premonition which lead -PRON- on tell -PRON- that this image would without any overt act of -PRON- encounter -PRON- 
-PRON- would meet quietly as if -PRON- have know each other and have make -PRON- tryst perhaps at one of the gate or in some more secret place 
-PRON- would be alone surround by darkness and silence and in that moment of supreme tenderness -PRON- would be transfigure 
-PRON- would fade into something impalpable under -PRON- eye and then in a moment -PRON- would be transfigure 
weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from -PRON- in that magic moment 
two great yellow caravan have halt one morning before the door and man have come tramp into the house to dismantle -PRON- 
the furniture have be hustle out through the front garden which be strew with wisps of straw and rope end and into the huge van at the gate 
when all have be safely stow the van have set off noisily down the avenue and from the window of the railway carriage in which -PRON- have sit with -PRON- redeyed mother stephen have see -PRON- lumber along the merrion road 
the parlour fire would not draw that evening and mr dedalus rest the poker against the bar of the grate to attract the flame 
uncle charle doze in a corner of the half furnish uncarpeted room and near -PRON- the family portrait lean against the wall 
the lamp on the table shed a weak light over the boarded floor muddy by the foot of the vanman 
stephen sit on a footstool beside -PRON- father listen to a long and incoherent monologue 
-PRON- understand little or nothing of -PRON- at first but -PRON- become slowly aware that -PRON- father have enemy and that some fight be go to take place 
-PRON- feel too that -PRON- be be enlist for the fight that some duty be be lay upon -PRON- shoulder 
the sudden flight from the comfort and reverie of blackrock the passage through the gloomy foggy city the thought of the bare cheerless house in which -PRON- be now to live make -PRON- heart heavy and again an intuition a foreknowledge of the future come to -PRON- 
-PRON- understand also why the servant have often whisper together in the hall and why -PRON- father have often stand on the hearthrug with -PRON- back to the fire talk loudly to uncle charle who urge -PRON- to sit down and eat -PRON- dinner a crack of the whip leave in -PRON- yet stephen old chap say mr dedalus poking at the dull fire with fierce energy not dead yet sonny 
no by the lord jesus god forgive -PRON- nor half dead 
dublin be a new and complex sensation 
uncle charle have grow so witless that -PRON- could no longer be send out on errand and the disorder in settle in the new house leave stephen free than -PRON- have be in blackrock 
in the beginning -PRON- content -PRON- with circle timidly round the neighbouring square or at most go half way down one of the side street but when -PRON- have make a skeleton map of the city in -PRON- mind -PRON- follow boldly one of -PRON- central line until -PRON- reach the custom house 
-PRON- pass unchallenged among the dock and along the quay wonder at the multitude of cork that lay bob on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum at the crowd of quay porter and the rumble cart and the illdresse bearded policeman 
the vastness and strangeness of the life suggest to -PRON- by the bale of merchandise stock along the wall or swing aloft out of the hold of steamer waken again in -PRON- the unrest which have send -PRON- wander in the evening from garden to garden in search of mercede 
and amid this new bustling life -PRON- may have fancy -PRON- in another marseille but that -PRON- miss the bright sky and the sunwarmed trellis of the wineshop 
a vague dissatisfaction grow up within -PRON- as -PRON- look on the quay and on the river and on the lower sky and yet -PRON- continue to wander up and down day after day as if -PRON- really seek someone that elude -PRON- 
-PRON- go once or twice with -PRON- mother to visit -PRON- relative and though -PRON- pass a jovial array of shop light up and adorn for christmas -PRON- mood of embittered silence do not leave -PRON- 
the cause of -PRON- embitterment be many remote and near 
-PRON- be angry with -PRON- for be young and the prey of restless foolish impulse angry also with the change of fortune which be reshape the world about -PRON- into a vision of squalor and insincerity 
yet -PRON- anger lend nothing to the vision 
-PRON- chronicle with patience what -PRON- see detach -PRON- from -PRON- and taste -PRON- mortify flavour in secret 
-PRON- be sit on the backless chair in -PRON- aunt kitchen 
a lamp with a reflector hang on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by -PRON- light -PRON- aunt be read the evening paper that lie on -PRON- knee 
-PRON- look a long time at a smile picture that be set in -PRON- and say musingly the beautiful mabel hunter 
a ringletted girl stand on tiptoe to peer at the picture and say softly what be -PRON- in mud 
in a pantomime love 
the child lean -PRON- ringletted head against -PRON- mother sleeve gaze on the picture and murmur as if fascinate the beautiful mabel hunter 
as if fascinate -PRON- eye rest long upon those demurely taunt eye and -PRON- murmur devotedly -PRON- an exquisite creature 
and the boy who come in from the street stamp crookedly under -PRON- stone of coal hear -PRON- word 
-PRON- drop -PRON- load promptly on the floor and hurry to -PRON- side to see 
-PRON- maul the edge of the paper with -PRON- redden and blacken hand shoulder -PRON- aside and complain that -PRON- could not see 
-PRON- be sit in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old darkwindowed house 
the firelight flicker on the wall and beyond the window a spectral dusk be gather upon the river 
before the fire an old woman be busy make tea and as -PRON- bustle at the task -PRON- tell in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor have say 
-PRON- tell too of certain change -PRON- have see in -PRON- of late and of -PRON- odd way and saying 
-PRON- sit listen to the word and follow the way of adventure that lie open in the coal arch and vault and wind gallery and jagged cavern 
suddenly -PRON- become aware of something in the doorway 
a skull appear suspend in the gloom of the doorway 
a feeble creature like a monkey be there draw thither by the sound of voice at the fire 
a whine voice come from the door ask be that josephine 
the old bustling woman answer cheerily from the fireplace no ellen -PRON- stephen good evening stephen 
-PRON- answer the greeting and see a silly smile break over the face in the doorway 
do -PRON- want anything ellen ask the old woman at the fire 
but -PRON- do not answer the question and say think -PRON- be josephine 
i think -PRON- be josephine stephen 
and repeat this several time -PRON- fall to laugh feebly 
-PRON- be sit in the midst of a children party at cross 
-PRON- silent watchful manner have grow upon -PRON- and -PRON- take little part in the game 
the child wear the spoil of -PRON- cracker dance and romp noisily and though -PRON- try to share -PRON- merriment -PRON- feel -PRON- a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hat and sunbonnet 
but when -PRON- have sing -PRON- song and withdraw into a snug corner of the room -PRON- begin to taste the joy of -PRON- loneliness 
the mirth which in the beginning of the evening have seem to -PRON- false and trivial be like a soothe air to -PRON- pass gaily by -PRON- sense hide from other eye the feverish agitation of -PRON- blood while through the circling of the dancer and amid the music and laughter -PRON- glance travel to -PRON- corner flatter taunt search exciting -PRON- heart 
in the hall the child who have stay latest be put on -PRON- thing the party be over 
-PRON- have throw a shawl about -PRON- and as -PRON- go together towards the tram spray of -PRON- fresh warm breath fly gaily above -PRON- cowl head and -PRON- shoe tap blithely on the glassy road 
-PRON- be the last tram 
the lank brown horse know -PRON- and shake -PRON- bell to the clear night in admonition 
the conductor talk with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp 
on the empty seat of the tram be scatter a few coloured ticket 
no sound of footstep come up or down the road 
no sound break the peace of the night save when the lank brown horse rub -PRON- nose together and shake -PRON- bell 
-PRON- seem to listen -PRON- on the upper step and -PRON- on the low 
-PRON- come up to -PRON- step many time and go down to -PRON- again between -PRON- phrase and once or twice stand close beside -PRON- for some moment on the upper step forget to go down and then go down 
-PRON- heart dance upon -PRON- movement like a cork upon a tide 
-PRON- hear what -PRON- eye say to -PRON- from beneath -PRON- cowl and know that in some dim past whether in life or reverie -PRON- have hear -PRON- tale before 
-PRON- see -PRON- urge -PRON- vanity -PRON- fine dress and sash and long black stocking and know that -PRON- have yield to -PRON- a thousand time 
yet a voice within -PRON- speak above the noise of -PRON- dancing heart ask -PRON- would -PRON- take -PRON- gift to which -PRON- have only to stretch out -PRON- hand 
and -PRON- remember the day when -PRON- and eileen have stand look into the hotel ground watch the waiter run up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scamper to and fro on the sunny lawn and how all of a sudden -PRON- have break out into a peal of laughter and have run down the slope curve of the path 
now as then -PRON- stand listlessly in -PRON- place seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before -PRON- 
-PRON- too want -PRON- to catch hold of -PRON- -PRON- think why -PRON- come with -PRON- to the tram 
i could easily catch hold of -PRON- when -PRON- come up to -PRON- step nobody be look 
i could hold -PRON- and kiss -PRON- 
but -PRON- do neither and when -PRON- be sit alone in the deserted tram -PRON- tear -PRON- ticket into shred and stare gloomily at the corrugate footboard 
the next day -PRON- sit at -PRON- table in the bare upper room for many hour 
before -PRON- lie a new pen a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise 
from force of habit -PRON- have write at the top of the first page the initial letter of the jesuit motto on the first line of the page appear the title of the verse -PRON- be try to write to -PRON- know -PRON- be right to begin so for -PRON- have see similar title in the collected poem of lord byron 
when -PRON- have write this title and draw an ornamental line underneath -PRON- fall into a daydream and begin to draw diagram on the cover of the book 
-PRON- see -PRON- sit at -PRON- table in bray the morning after the discussion at the christmas dinner table try to write a poem about parnell on the back of one of -PRON- father second moiety notice 
but -PRON- brain have then refuse to grapple with the theme and desist -PRON- have cover the page with the name and address of certain of -PRON- classmate roderick kickham john lawton anthony simon moonan now -PRON- seem as if -PRON- would fail again but by dint of brood on the incident -PRON- think -PRON- into confidence 
during this process all those element which -PRON- deem common and insignificant fall out of the scene 
there remain no trace of the tram -PRON- nor of the tramman nor of the horse nor do -PRON- and -PRON- appear vividly 
the verse tell only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon 
some undefined sorrow be hide in the heart of the protagonist as -PRON- stand in silence beneath the leafless tree and when the moment of farewell have come the kiss which have be withhold by one be give by both 
after this the letter be write at the foot of the page and have hide the book -PRON- go into -PRON- mother bedroom and gaze at -PRON- face for a long time in the mirror of -PRON- dressingtable 
but -PRON- long spell of leisure and liberty be draw to -PRON- end 
one evening -PRON- father come home full of news which keep -PRON- tongue busy all through dinner 
stephen have be await -PRON- father return for there have be mutton hash that day and -PRON- know that -PRON- father would make -PRON- dip -PRON- bread in the gravy

the night of the whitsuntide play have come and stephen from the window of the dressingroom look out on the small grassplot across which line of chinese lantern be stretch 
-PRON- watch the visitor come down the step from the house and pass into the theatre 
steward in evening dress old belvederean loiter in group about the entrance to the theatre and usher in the visitor with ceremony 
under the sudden glow of a lantern -PRON- could recognise the smile face of a priest 
the bless sacrament have be remove from the tabernacle and the first bench have be drive back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space before -PRON- free 
against the wall stand company of barbell and indian club the dumbbell be pile in one corner and in the midst of countless hillock of gymnasium shoe and sweater and singlet in untidy brown parcel there stand the stout leatherjackete vaulting horse wait -PRON- turn to be carry up on the stage and set in the middle of the win team at the end of the gymnastic display 
stephen though in deference to -PRON- reputation for essay writing -PRON- have be elect secretary to the gymnasium have have no part in the first section of the programme but in the play which form the second section -PRON- have the chief part that of a farcical pedagogue 
-PRON- have be cast for -PRON- on account of -PRON- stature and grave manner for -PRON- be now at the end of -PRON- second year at belvedere and in number two 
a score of the young boy in white knicker and singlet come patter down from the stage through the vestry and into the chapel 
the vestry and chapel be people with eager master and boy 
the plump bald sergeant major be test with -PRON- foot the springboard of the vaulting horse 
the lean young man in a long overcoat who be to give a special display of intricate club swinging stand near watch with interest -PRON- silvercoated club peep out of -PRON- deep sidepocket 
the hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbell be hear as another team make ready to go up on the stage and in another moment the excited prefect be hustle the boy through the vestry like a flock of geese flap the wing of -PRON- soutane nervously and cry to the laggard to make haste 
a little troop of neapolitan peasant be practise -PRON- step at the end of the chapel some circle -PRON- arm above -PRON- head some sway -PRON- basket of paper violet and curtseying 
in a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid -PRON- copious black skirt 
when -PRON- stand up a pinkdressed figure wear a curly golden wig and an oldfashione straw sunbonnet with black pencil eyebrow and cheek delicately rouge and powder be discover 
a low murmur of curiosity run round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure 
one of the prefect smile and nod -PRON- head approach the dark corner and have bow to the stout old lady say pleasantly be this a beautiful young lady or a doll that -PRON- have here mrs tallon 
then bend down to peer at the smile paint face under the leaf of the bonnet -PRON- exclaim no 
upon -PRON- word i believe -PRON- little bertie tallon after all 
stephen at -PRON- post by the window hear the old lady and the priest laugh together and hear the boy murmur of admiration behind -PRON- as -PRON- pass forward to see the little boy who have to dance the sunbonnet dance by -PRON- 
a movement of impatience escape -PRON- 
-PRON- let the edge of the blind fall and step down from the bench on which -PRON- have be stand walk out of the chapel 
-PRON- pass out of the schoolhouse and halt under the shed that flank the garden 
from the theatre opposite come the muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clash of the soldier band 
the light spread upwards from the glass roof make the theatre seem a festive ark anchor among the hulk of house -PRON- frail cable of lantern loop -PRON- to -PRON- mooring 
a side door of the theatre open suddenly and a shaft of light fly across the grassplot 
a sudden burst of music issue from the ark the prelude of a waltz and when the side door close again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music 
the sentiment of the opening bar -PRON- languor and supple movement evoke the incommunicable emotion which have be the cause of all -PRON- day unrest and of -PRON- impatient movement of a moment before 
-PRON- unrest issue from -PRON- like a wave of sound and on the tide of flow music the ark be journey trail -PRON- cable of lantern in -PRON- wake 
then a noise like dwarf artillery break the movement 
-PRON- be the clapping that greet the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage 
at the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light show in the darkness and as -PRON- walk towards -PRON- -PRON- become aware of a faint aromatic odour 
two boy be stand in the shelter of a doorway smoking and before -PRON- reach -PRON- -PRON- have recognise heron by -PRON- voice 
here come the noble dedalus cry a high throaty voice 
welcome to -PRON- trusty friend 
this welcome end in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as heron salaamed and then begin to poke the ground with -PRON- cane 
here i be say stephen halting and glance from heron to -PRON- friend 
the latter be a stranger to -PRON- but in the darkness by the aid of the glow cigarette tip -PRON- could make out a pale dandyish face over which a smile be travel slowly a tall overcoate figure and a hard hat 
heron do not trouble -PRON- about an introduction but say instead be just tell -PRON- friend wallis what a lark -PRON- would be tonight if -PRON- take off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster 
-PRON- would be a rip good joke 
heron make a poor attempt to imitate for -PRON- friend wallis the rector pedantic bass and then laugh at -PRON- failure ask stephen to do -PRON- 
go on dedalus -PRON- urge -PRON- can take -PRON- off rippingly 
-PRON- that will not hear the churcha let -PRON- be to theea as the heathena and the publicana the imitation be prevent by a mild expression of anger from wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette have become too tightly wedge 
damn this blankety blank holder -PRON- say take -PRON- from -PRON- mouth and smile and frowning upon -PRON- tolerantly always get stuck like that 
do -PRON- use a holder donot smoke answer stephen 
no say heron dedalus be a model youth 
-PRON- doesnot smoke and -PRON- doesnot go to bazaar and -PRON- doesnot flirt and -PRON- doesnot damn anything or damn all 
stephen shake -PRON- head and smile in -PRON- rival flush and mobile face beak like a bird 
-PRON- have often think -PRON- strange that vincent heron have a bird face as well as a bird name 
a shock of pale hair lie on the forehead like a ruffle crest the forehead be narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stand out between the closeset prominent eye which be light and inexpressive 
the rival be school friend 
-PRON- sit together in class knelt together in the chapel talk together after bead over -PRON- lunch 
as the fellow in number one be undistinguished dullard stephen and heron have be during the year the virtual head of the school 
-PRON- be -PRON- who go up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off by the way say heron suddenly i see -PRON- governor go in 
the smile wane on face 
any allusion make to -PRON- father by a fellow or by a master put -PRON- calm to rout in a moment 
-PRON- wait in timorous silence to hear what heron may say next 
heron however nudge -PRON- expressively with -PRON- elbow and say a sly dog 
why so say stephen think butter wouldnot melt in -PRON- mouth say heron 
but afraid -PRON- be a sly dog 
may i ask -PRON- what -PRON- be talk about say stephen urbanely 
indeed -PRON- may answer heron 
-PRON- see -PRON- wallis didnot -PRON- 
and deucedly pretty -PRON- be too 
and inquisitive 
and what part do stephen take mr dedalus 
and will stephen not sing mr dedalus -PRON- governor be stare at -PRON- through that eyeglass of -PRON- for all -PRON- be worth so that i think the old man have find -PRON- out too 
i wouldnot care a bit by jove rip isnot -PRON- wallis 
not half bad answered wallis quietly as -PRON- place -PRON- holder once more in a corner of -PRON- mouth 
a shaft of momentary anger fly through mind at these indelicate allusion in the hearing of a stranger 
for -PRON- there be nothing amusing in a girls interest and regard 
all day -PRON- have think of nothing but -PRON- leavetaking on the step of the tram at cross the stream of moody emotion -PRON- have make to course through -PRON- and the poem -PRON- have write about -PRON- 
all day -PRON- have imagine a new meeting with -PRON- for -PRON- know that -PRON- be to come to the play 
the old restless moodiness have again fill -PRON- breast as -PRON- have do on the night of the party but have not find an outlet in verse 
the growth and knowledge of two year of boyhood stand between then and now forbid such an outlet and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within -PRON- have start forth and return upon -PRON- in dark course and eddy weary -PRON- in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the paint little boy have draw from -PRON- a movement of impatience 
so -PRON- may as well admit heron go on that -PRON- have fairly find -PRON- out this time 
-PRON- canot play the saint on -PRON- any more that s one sure five 
a soft peal of mirthless laughter escape from -PRON- lip and bend down as before -PRON- strike stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with -PRON- cane as if in jesting reproof moment of anger have already pass 
-PRON- be neither flatter nor confused but simply wish the banter to end 
-PRON- scarcely resent what have seem to -PRON- a silly indelicateness for -PRON- know that the adventure in -PRON- mind stand in no danger from these word and -PRON- face mirror -PRON- rival false smile 
admit repeat heron strike -PRON- again with -PRON- cane across the calf of the leg 
the stroke be playful but not so lightly give as the first one have be 
stephen feel the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly and bow submissively as if to meet -PRON- companion jest mood begin to recite the confiteor 
the episode end well for both heron and wallis laugh indulgently at the irreverence 
the confession come only from lip and while -PRON- speak the word a sudden memory have carry -PRON- to another scene call up as if by magic at the moment when -PRON- have note the faint cruel dimple at the corner of smile lip and have feel the familiar stroke of the cane against -PRON- calf and have hear the familiar word of admonition admit 
-PRON- be towards the close of -PRON- first term in the college when -PRON- be in number six 
-PRON- sensitive nature be still smart under the lash of an undivined and squalid way of life 
-PRON- soul be still disquiet and cast down by the dull phenomenon of dublin 
-PRON- have emerge from a two year spell of reverie to find -PRON- in the midst of a new scene every event and figure of which affect -PRON- intimately dishearten -PRON- or allure and whether allure or disheartening fill -PRON- always with unrest and bitter thought 
all the leisure which -PRON- school life leave -PRON- be pass in the company of subversive writer whose gibe and violence of speech set up a ferment in -PRON- brain before -PRON- pass out of -PRON- into -PRON- crude writing 
the essay be for -PRON- the chief labour of -PRON- week and every tuesday as -PRON- march from home to the school -PRON- read -PRON- fate in the incident of the way pit -PRON- against some figure ahead of -PRON- and quicken -PRON- pace to outstrip -PRON- before a certain goal be reach or plant -PRON- step scrupulously in the space of the patchwork of the pathway and tell -PRON- that -PRON- would be first and not first in the weekly essay 
on a certain tuesday the course of -PRON- triumph be rudely break 
mr tate the english master point -PRON- finger at -PRON- and say bluntly this fellow have heresy in -PRON- essay 
a hush fall on the class 
mr tate do not break -PRON- but dig with -PRON- hand between -PRON- thigh while -PRON- heavily starch linen creak about -PRON- neck and wrist 
stephen do not look up 
-PRON- be a raw spring morning and -PRON- eye be still smart and weak 
-PRON- be conscious of failure and of detection of the squalor of -PRON- own mind and home and feel against -PRON- neck the raw edge of -PRON- turned and jagged collar 
a short loud laugh from mr tate set the class more at ease 
perhaps -PRON- didnot know that -PRON- say 
where ask stephen 
mr tate withdraw -PRON- delving hand and spread out the essay 
here about the creator and the soul 
rrm rrm rrm 
ah 
without a possibility of ever approach near heresy 
stephen murmur mean without a possibility of ever reach 
-PRON- be a submission and mr tate appease fold up the essay and pass -PRON- across to -PRON- say ah 
ever reach another story 
but the class be not so soon appeased 
though nobody speak to -PRON- of the affair after class -PRON- could feel about -PRON- a vague general malignant joy 
a few night after this public chide -PRON- be walk with a letter along the drumcondra road when -PRON- hear a voice cry halt 
-PRON- turn and see three boy of -PRON- own class come towards -PRON- in the dusk 
-PRON- be heron who have call out and as -PRON- march forward between -PRON- two attendant -PRON- cleave the air before -PRON- with a thin cane in time to -PRON- step 
boland -PRON- friend march beside -PRON- a large grin on -PRON- face while nash come on a few step behind blow from the pace and wag -PRON- great red head 
as soon as the boy have turn into clonliffe road together -PRON- begin to speak about book and writer say what book -PRON- be read and how many book there be in -PRON- father bookcase at home 
stephen listen to -PRON- in some wonderment for boland be the dunce and nash the idler of the class 
in fact after some talk about -PRON- favourite writer nash declare for captain marryat who -PRON- say be the great writer

the grin broaden on freckle face as -PRON- turn to stephen and say and do -PRON- like cardinal newman dedalus many say that newman have the good prose style heron say to the other two in explanation of course -PRON- s not a poet 
and who be the good poet heron ask boland

everyone know that tennyson be the great poet 
and who do -PRON- think be the great poet ask boland nudge -PRON- neighbour

heron give the lead and all three join in a scornful laugh 
what be -PRON- laugh at ask stephen 
-PRON- say heron 
byron the great poet only a poet for uneducated people 
-PRON- must be a fine poet say boland 
-PRON- may keep -PRON- mouth shut say stephen turn on -PRON- boldly 
all -PRON- know about poetry be what -PRON- write up on the slate in the yard and be go to be send to the loft for 
boland in fact be say to have write on the slate in the yard a couplet about a classmate of -PRON- who often ride home from the college on a pony as tyson be ride into jerusalem -PRON- fall and hurt -PRON- alec kafoozelum 
this thrust put the two lieutenant to silence but heron go on in any case byron be a heretic and immoral too donot care what -PRON- be cry stephen hotly 
-PRON- donot care whether -PRON- be a heretic or not say nash 
what do -PRON- know about -PRON- shout stephen 
-PRON- never read a line of anything in -PRON- life except a trans or boland either know that byron be a bad man say boland 
here catch hold of this heretic heron call out

nash pinion -PRON- arm behind while boland seize a long cabbage stump which be lie in the gutter 
struggle and kick under the cut of the cane and the blow of the knotty stump stephen be bear back against a barbed wire fence 
admit that byron be no good 
no

admit

no 
at last after a fury of plunge -PRON- wrench -PRON- free 
-PRON- tormentor set off towards road laugh and jeer at -PRON- while -PRON- half blind with tear stumble on clench -PRON- fist madly and sob 
while -PRON- be still repeat the confiteor amid the indulgent laughter of -PRON- hearer and while the scene of that malignant episode be still pass sharply and swiftly before -PRON- mind -PRON- wonder why -PRON- bear no malice now to those who have torment -PRON- 
-PRON- have not forget a whit of -PRON- cowardice and cruelty but the memory of -PRON- call forth no anger from -PRON- 
all the description of fierce love and hatred which -PRON- have meet in book have seem to -PRON- therefore unreal 
even that night as -PRON- stumble homeward along road -PRON- have feel that some power be divest -PRON- of that suddenwoven anger as easily as a fruit be divest of -PRON- soft ripe peel 
-PRON- remain stand with -PRON- two companion at the end of the shed listen idly to -PRON- talk or to the burst of applause in the theatre 
-PRON- be sit there among the other perhaps wait for -PRON- to appear 
-PRON- try to recall -PRON- appearance but could not 
-PRON- could remember only that -PRON- have wear a shawl about -PRON- head like a cowl and that -PRON- dark eye have invite and unnerve -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder have -PRON- be in -PRON- thought as -PRON- have be in -PRON- 
then in the dark and unseen by the other two -PRON- rest the tip of the finger of one hand upon the palm of the other hand scarcely touch -PRON- lightly 
but the pressure of -PRON- finger have be light and steady and suddenly the memory of -PRON- touch traverse -PRON- brain and body like an invisible wave 
a boy come towards -PRON- run along under the shed 
-PRON- be excited and breathless 
dedalus -PRON- cry doyle be in a great bake about -PRON- to go in at once and get dressed for the play 
hurry up -PRON- better come now say heron to the messenger with a haughty drawl when -PRON- want to 
the boy turn to heron and repeat but doyle be in an awful bake 
will -PRON- tell doyle with -PRON- good compliment that i damn -PRON- eye answer heron 
well i must go now say stephen who care little for such point of honour wouldnot say heron damn -PRON- if i would no way to send for one of the senior boy 
in a bake indeed 
i think -PRON- quite enough that -PRON- be take a part in -PRON- bally old play 
this spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which -PRON- have observe lately in -PRON- rival have not seduce stephen from -PRON- habit of quiet obedience 
-PRON- mistrust the turbulence and doubt the sincerity of such comradeship which seem to -PRON- a sorry anticipation of manhood 
the question of honour here raise be like all such question trivial to -PRON- 
while -PRON- mind have be pursue -PRON- intangible phantom and turn in irresolution from such pursuit -PRON- have hear about -PRON- the constant voice of -PRON- father and of -PRON- master urge -PRON- to be a gentleman above all thing and urge -PRON- to be a good catholic above all thing 
these voice have now come to be hollowsounde in -PRON- ear 
when the gymnasium have be open -PRON- have hear another voice urge -PRON- to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival have begin to be feel in the college yet another voice have bid -PRON- be true to -PRON- country and help to raise up -PRON- language and tradition 
in the profane world as -PRON- foresee a worldly voice would bid -PRON- raise up -PRON- father fall state by -PRON- labour and meanwhile the voice of -PRON- school comrade urge -PRON- to be a decent fellow to shield other from blame or to beg -PRON- off and to do -PRON- good to get free day for the school 
and -PRON- be the din of all these hollowsounde voice that make -PRON- halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantom 
-PRON- give -PRON- ear only for a time but -PRON- be happy only when -PRON- be far from -PRON- beyond -PRON- call alone or in the company of phantasmal comrade 
in the vestry a plump freshface jesuit and an elderly man in shabby blue clothe be dabble in a case of paint and chalks 
the boy who have be paint walk about or stand still awkwardly touch -PRON- face in a gingerly fashion with -PRON- furtive fingertip 
in the middle of the vestry a young jesuit who be then on a visit to the college stand rock -PRON- rhythmically from the tip of -PRON- toe to -PRON- heel and back again -PRON- hand thrust well forward into -PRON- sidepocket 
-PRON- small head set off with glossy red curl and -PRON- newly shaven face agree well with the spotless decency of -PRON- soutane and with -PRON- spotless shoe 
as -PRON- watch this swaying form and try to read for -PRON- the legend of the priest mocking smile there come into memory a saying which -PRON- have hear from -PRON- father before -PRON- have be send to clongowes that -PRON- could always tell a jesuit by the style of -PRON- clothe 
at the same moment -PRON- think -PRON- see a likeness between -PRON- father mind and that of this smile welldressed priest and -PRON- be aware of some desecration of the priest office or of the vestry -PRON- whose silence be now route by loud talk and joking and -PRON- air pungent with the smell of the gasjet and the grease 
while -PRON- forehead be be wrinkle and -PRON- jaw paint black and blue by the elderly man -PRON- listen distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit which bid -PRON- speak up and make -PRON- point clearly 
-PRON- could hear the band play the lily of killarney and know that in a few moment the curtain would go up 
-PRON- feel no stage fright but the thought of the part -PRON- have to play humiliate -PRON- 
a remembrance of some of -PRON- line make a sudden flush rise to -PRON- paint cheek 
-PRON- see -PRON- serious alluring eye watch -PRON- from among the audience and -PRON- image at once sweep away -PRON- scruple leave -PRON- will compact 
another nature seem to have be lend -PRON- the infection of the excitement and youth about -PRON- enter into and transform -PRON- moody mistrustfulness 
for one rare moment -PRON- seem to be clothe in the real apparel of boyhood and as -PRON- stand in the wing among the other player -PRON- share the common mirth amid which the drop scene be haul upwards by two ablebodie priest with violent jerk and all awry 
a few moment after -PRON- find -PRON- on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery act before the innumerable face of the void 
-PRON- surprise -PRON- to see that the play which -PRON- have know at rehearsal for a disjointed lifeless thing have suddenly assume a life of -PRON- own 
-PRON- seem now to play -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- fellow actor aid -PRON- with -PRON- part 
when the curtain fall on the last scene -PRON- hear the void fill with applause and through a rift in a side scene see the simple body before which -PRON- have act magically deform the void of face break at all point and fall asunder into busy group 
-PRON- leave the stage quickly and rid -PRON- of -PRON- mummery and pass out through the chapel into the college garden 
now that the play be over -PRON- nerve cry for some further adventure 
-PRON- hurry onwards as if to overtake -PRON- 
the door of the theatre be all open and the audience have empty out 
on the line which -PRON- have fancy the mooring of an ark a few lantern swing in the night breeze flicker cheerlessly 
-PRON- mount the step from the garden in haste eager that some prey should not elude -PRON- and force -PRON- way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuit who stand watch the exodus and bow and shake hand with the visitor 
-PRON- push onward nervously feign a still great haste and faintly conscious of the smile and stare and nudge which -PRON- powder head leave in -PRON- wake 
when -PRON- come out on the step -PRON- see -PRON- family wait for -PRON- at the first lamp 
in a glance -PRON- note that every figure of the group be familiar and run down the step angrily have to leave a message down in street -PRON- say to -PRON- father quickly be home after -PRON- 
without wait for -PRON- father question -PRON- run across the road and begin to walk at breakneck speed down the hill 
-PRON- hardly know where -PRON- be walk 
pride and hope and desire like crush herb in -PRON- heart send up vapour of madden incense before the eye of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- stride down the hill amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapour of wound pride and fall hope and baffled desire 
-PRON- stream upwards before -PRON- anguished eye in dense and maddening fume and pass away above -PRON- till at last the air be clear and cold again 
a film still veil -PRON- eye but -PRON- burn no longer 
a power akin to that which have often make anger or resentment fall from -PRON- bring -PRON- step to rest 
-PRON- stand still and gaze up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the dark cobble laneway at -PRON- side 
-PRON- see the word lott on the wall of the lane and breathe slowly the rank heavy air 
that be horse piss and rot straw -PRON- think 
-PRON- be a good odour to breathe 
-PRON- will calm -PRON- heart 
-PRON- heart be quite calm now 
i will go back 
stephen be once again seat beside -PRON- father in the corner of a railway carriage at kingsbridge 
-PRON- be travel with -PRON- father by the night mail to cork 
as the train steam out of the station -PRON- recall -PRON- childish wonder of year before and every event of -PRON- first day at clongowes 
but -PRON- feel no wonder now 
-PRON- see the darkening land slip away past -PRON- the silent telegraphpole pass -PRON- window swiftly every four second the little glimmering station man by a few silent sentry fling by the mail behind -PRON- and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grain fling backwards by a runner 
-PRON- listen without sympathy to -PRON- father evocation of cork and of scene of -PRON- youth a tale break by sigh or draught from -PRON- pocket flask whenever the image of some dead friend appear in -PRON- or whenever the evoker remember suddenly the purpose of -PRON- actual visit 
stephen hear but could feel no pity 
the image of the dead be all stranger to -PRON- save that of uncle charle an image which have lately be fade out of memory 
-PRON- know however that -PRON- father property be go to be sell by auction and in the manner of -PRON- own dispossession -PRON- feel the world give the lie rudely to -PRON- phantasy 
at maryborough -PRON- fall asleep 
when -PRON- awake the train have pass out of mallow and -PRON- father be stretch asleep on the other seat 
the cold light of the dawn lie over the country over the unpeopled field and the closed cottage 
the terror of sleep fascinate -PRON- mind as -PRON- watch the silent country or hear from time to time -PRON- father deep breath or sudden sleepy movement 
the neighbourhood of unseen sleeper fill -PRON- with strange dread as though -PRON- could harm -PRON- and -PRON- pray that the day may come quickly 
-PRON- prayer address neither to god nor saint begin with a shiver as the chilly morning breeze creep through the chink of the carriage door to -PRON- foot and end in a trail of foolish word which -PRON- make to fit the insistent rhythm of the train and silently at interval of four second the telegraphpole hold the gallop note of the music between punctual bar 
this furious music allay -PRON- dread and lean against the windowledge -PRON- let -PRON- eyelid close again 
-PRON- drive in a jingle across cork while -PRON- be still early morning and stephen finish -PRON- sleep in a bedroom of the victoria hotel 
the bright warm sunlight be stream through the window and -PRON- could hear the din of traffic 
-PRON- father be stand before the dressingtable examine -PRON- hair and face and moustache with great care crane -PRON- neck across the waterjug and draw -PRON- back sideways to see the well 
while -PRON- do so -PRON- sing softly to -PRON- with quaint accent and phrase tis youth and folly make young man marry so here -PRON- love no longer stay 
what canot be cure sure must be injure sure so go to amerikay 
-PRON- love -PRON- s handsome -PRON- love -PRON- s bony like good whisky when -PRON- be new but when tis old and grow cold -PRON- fade and die like the mountain dew 
the consciousness of the warm sunny city outside -PRON- window and the tender tremor with which -PRON- father voice festoon the strange sad happy air drive off all the mist of the night ill humour from brain 
-PRON- get up quickly to dress and when the song have end say much pretty than any of -PRON- other comeallyous 
do -PRON- think so ask mr dedalus like -PRON- say stephen a pretty old air say mr dedalus twirl the point of -PRON- moustache 
ah but -PRON- should have hear mick lacy sing -PRON- 
poor mick lacy 
-PRON- have little turn for -PRON- grace note that -PRON- use to put in that i havenot get 
that be the boy who could sing a comeallyou if -PRON- like 
mr dedalus have order drisheen for breakfast and during the meal -PRON- crossexamine the waiter for local news 
for the most part -PRON- speak at cross purpose when a name be mention the waiter have in mind the present holder and mr dedalus -PRON- father or perhaps -PRON- grandfather 
well i hope -PRON- havenot move the college anyhow say mr dedalus for i want to show -PRON- to this youngster of mine 
along the mardyke the tree be in bloom 
-PRON- enter the ground of the college and be lead by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle 
but -PRON- progress across the gravel be bring to a halt after every dozen or so pace by some reply of the porter 
ah do -PRON- tell -PRON- so 
and be poor pottlebelly dead 
yes sir 
dead sir 
during these halt stephen stand awkwardly behind the two man weary of the subject and wait restlessly for the slow march to begin again 
by the time -PRON- have cross the quadrangle -PRON- restlessness have rise to fever 
-PRON- wonder how -PRON- father whom -PRON- know for a shrewd suspicious man could be dupe by the servile manner of the porter and the lively southern speech which have entertain -PRON- all the morning now irritate -PRON- ear 
-PRON- pass into the anatomy theatre where mr dedalu the porter aid -PRON- search the desk for -PRON- initial 
stephen remain in the background depress more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air -PRON- wear of jaded and formal study 
on the desk -PRON- read the word ftus cut several time in the dark stained wood 
the sudden legend startle -PRON- blood -PRON- seem to feel the absent student of the college about -PRON- and to shrink from -PRON- company 
a vision of -PRON- life which -PRON- father word have be powerless to evoke spring up before -PRON- out of the word cut in the desk 
a broadshouldere student with a moustache be cut in the letter with a jackknife seriously 
other student stand or sit near -PRON- laugh at -PRON- handiwork 
one jog -PRON- elbow 
the big student turn on -PRON- frowning 
-PRON- be dress in loose grey clothe and have tan boot name be call 
-PRON- hurry down the step of the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as -PRON- could be and peer closely at -PRON- father initial hide -PRON- flushed face 
but the word and the vision caper before -PRON- eye as -PRON- walk back across the quadrangle and towards the college gate 
-PRON- shock -PRON- to find in the outer world a trace of what -PRON- have deem till then a brutish and individual malady of -PRON- own mind 
-PRON- monstrous reverie come throng into -PRON- memory 
-PRON- too have spring up before -PRON- suddenly and furiously out of mere word 
-PRON- have soon give in to -PRON- and allow -PRON- to sweep across and abase -PRON- intellect wonder always where -PRON- come from from what den of monstrous image and always weak and humble towards other restless and sicken of -PRON- when -PRON- have sweep over -PRON- 
ay bedad 
and there s the grocery sure enough cry mr dedalus

the leave of the tree along the mardyke be astir and whisper in the sunlight 
a team of cricketer pass agile young man in flannel and blazer one of -PRON- carry the long green wicketbag 
in a quiet bystreet a german band of five player in fade uniform and with batter brass instrument be play to an audience of street arab and leisurely messenger boy 
a maid in a white cap and apron be water a box of plant on a sill which shine like a slab of limestone in the warm glare 
from another window open to the air come the sound of a piano scale after scale rise into the treble 
stephen walk on at -PRON- father side listen to story -PRON- have hear before hear again the name of the scatter and dead reveller who have be the companion of -PRON- father youth 
and a faint sickness sigh in -PRON- heart 
-PRON- recall -PRON- own equivocal position in belvedere a free boy a leader afraid of -PRON- own authority proud and sensitive and suspicious battle against the squalor of -PRON- life and against the riot of -PRON- mind 
the letter cut in the stained wood of the desk stare upon -PRON- mock -PRON- bodily weakness and futile enthusiasm and make -PRON- loathe -PRON- for -PRON- own mad and filthy orgy 
the spittle in -PRON- throat grow bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climb to -PRON- brain so that for a moment -PRON- close -PRON- eye and walk on in darkness 
-PRON- could still hear -PRON- father -PRON- kick out for -PRON- i daresay -PRON- will one of these daysremember whatever -PRON- do to mix with gentleman 
when i be a young fellow i tell -PRON- i enjoy -PRON-

the woman use to stand to look after -PRON- in the street 
-PRON- hear the sob pass loudly down -PRON- father throat and open -PRON- eye with a nervous impulse 
the sunlight break suddenly on -PRON- sight turn the sky and cloud into a fantastic world of sombre masse with lakelike space of dark rosy light 
-PRON- very brain be sick and powerless 
-PRON- could scarcely interpret the letter of the signboard of the shop 
by -PRON- monstrous way of life -PRON- seem to have put -PRON- beyond the limit of reality 
nothing move -PRON- or speak to -PRON- from the real world unless -PRON- hear in -PRON- an echo of the infuriate cry within -PRON- 
-PRON- could respond to no earthly or human appeal dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship weary and deject by -PRON- father voice 
-PRON- could scarcely recognise as -PRON- own thought and repeat slowly to -PRON- be stephen dedalus

on the evening of the day on which the property be sell stephen follow -PRON- father meekly about the city from bar to bar

an abyss of fortune or of temperament sunder -PRON- from -PRON- 
-PRON- mind seem old than -PRON- -PRON- shine coldly on -PRON- strife and happiness and regret like a moon upon a young earth 
no life or youth stir in -PRON- as -PRON- have stir in -PRON- 
-PRON- have know neither the pleasure of companionship with other nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial piety 
nothing stir within -PRON- soul but a cold and cruel and loveless lust 
-PRON- childhood be dead or lose and with -PRON- -PRON- soul capable of simple joy and -PRON- be drift amid life like the barren shell of the moon 
art thou pale for weariness of climb heaven and gaze on the earth wander companionless 
-PRON- repeat to -PRON- the line of fragment 
-PRON- alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycle of activity chill -PRON- and -PRON- forget -PRON- own human and ineffectual grieve mother and -PRON- brother and one of -PRON- cousin wait at the corner of quiet foster place while -PRON- and -PRON- father go up the step and along the colonnade where the highland sentry be parade 
when -PRON- have pass into the great hall and stand at the counter stephen draw forth -PRON- order on the governor of the bank of ireland for thirty and three pound and these sum the money of -PRON- exhibition and essay prize be pay over to -PRON- rapidly by the teller in note and in coin respectively 
-PRON- bestow -PRON- in -PRON- pocket with feigned composure and suffer the friendly teller to whom -PRON- father chat to take -PRON- hand across the broad counter and wish -PRON- a brilliant career in after life 
-PRON- be impatient of -PRON- voice and could not keep -PRON- foot at rest 
but the teller still defer the serving of other to say -PRON- be live in change time and that there be nothing like give a boy the good education that money could buy 
mr dedalus linger in the hall gaze about -PRON- and up at the roof and telling stephen who urge -PRON- to come out that -PRON- be stand in the house of common of the old irish parliament 
god help -PRON- -PRON- say piously to think of the man of those time stephen hely hutchinson and flood and henry grattan and charle kendal bushe and the nobleman -PRON- have now leader of the irish people at home and abroad 
why by god -PRON- wouldnot be see dead in a tenacre field with -PRON- 
no stephen old chap sorry to say that -PRON- be only as i rove out one fine may morning in the merry month of sweet july 
a keen october wind be blow round the bank 
the three figure stand at the edge of the muddy path have pinch cheek and watery eye 
stephen look at -PRON- thinly clothe mother and remember that a few day before -PRON- have see a mantle price at twenty guinea in the window of well that s do say mr dedalus

-PRON- doesnot matter about the dearness 
-PRON- walk on before -PRON- with short nervous step smile 
-PRON- try to keep up with -PRON- smile also at -PRON- eagerness 
take -PRON- easy like a good young fellow say -PRON- father not out for the half mile be -PRON- 
for a swift season of merrymake the money of -PRON- prize run through finger 
great parcel of grocery and delicacy and dry fruit arrive from the city 
every day -PRON- draw up a bill of fare for the family and every night lead a party of three or four to the theatre to see ingomar or the lady of lyon 
in -PRON- coat pocket -PRON- carry square of vienna chocolate for -PRON- guest while -PRON- trouser pocket bulge with masse of silver and copper coin 
-PRON- buy present for everyone overhaul -PRON- room write out resolution marshal -PRON- book up and down -PRON- shelf pore upon all kind of price list draw up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of -PRON- hold some office open a loan bank for -PRON- family and press loan on willing borrower so that -PRON- may have the pleasure of make out receipt and reckon the interest on the sum lend 
when -PRON- could do no more -PRON- drive up and down the city in trams 
then the season of pleasure come to an end 
the pot of pink enamel paint give out and the wainscot of -PRON- bedroom remain with -PRON- unfinished and illplastere coat 
-PRON- household return to -PRON- usual way of life 
-PRON- mother have no further occasion to upbraid -PRON- for squander -PRON- money 
-PRON- too return to -PRON- old life at school and all -PRON- novel enterprise fall to piece 
the commonwealth fall the loan bank close -PRON- coffer and -PRON- book on a sensible loss the rule of life which -PRON- have draw about -PRON- fall into desuetude 
how foolish -PRON- aim have be 
-PRON- have try to build a breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without -PRON- and to dam up by rule of conduct and active interest and new filial relation the powerful recurrence of the tide within -PRON- 
useless 
from without as from within the water have flow over -PRON- barrier -PRON- tide begin once more to jostle fiercely above the crumble mole 
-PRON- see clearly too -PRON- own futile isolation 
-PRON- have not go one step nearer the life -PRON- have seek to approach nor bridge the restless shame and rancour that have divide -PRON- from mother and brother and sister 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- be hardly of the one blood with -PRON- but stand to -PRON- rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage fosterchild and fosterbrother 
-PRON- turn to appease the fierce longing of -PRON- heart before which everything else be idle and alien 
-PRON- care little that -PRON- be in mortal sin that -PRON- life have grow to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood 
beside the savage desire within -PRON- to realise the enormity which -PRON- brood on nothing be sacred 
-PRON- bear cynically with the shameful detail of -PRON- secret riot in which -PRON- exult to defile with patience whatever image have attract -PRON- eye 
by day and by night -PRON- move among distorted image of the outer world 
a figure that have seem to -PRON- by day demure and innocent come towards -PRON- by night through the wind darkness of sleep -PRON- face transfigure by a lecherous cunne -PRON- eye bright with brutish joy 
only the morning pain -PRON- with -PRON- dim memory of dark orgiastic riot -PRON- keen and humiliating sense of transgression 
-PRON- return to -PRON- wandering 
the veiled autumnal evening lead -PRON- from street to street as -PRON- have lead -PRON- year before along the quiet avenue of blackrock 
but no vision of trim front garden or of kindly light in the window pour a tender influence upon -PRON- now 
only at time in the pause of -PRON- desire when the luxury that be waste -PRON- give room to a soft languor the image of mercede traverse the background of -PRON- memory 
-PRON- see again the small white house and the garden of rosebush on the road that lead to the mountain and -PRON- remember the sadly proud gesture of refusal which -PRON- be to make there stand with -PRON- in the moonlit garden after year of estrangement and adventure 
at those moment the soft speech of claude melnotte rise to -PRON- lip and ease -PRON- unrest 
a tender premonition touch -PRON- of the tryst -PRON- have then look forward to and in spite of the horrible reality which lie between -PRON- hope of then and now of the holy encounter -PRON- have then imagine at which weakness and timidity and inexperience be to fall from -PRON- 
such moment pass and the waste fire of lust spring up again 
the verse pass from -PRON- lip and the inarticulate cry and the unspoken brutal word rush forth from -PRON- brain to force a passage 
-PRON- blood be in revolt

-PRON- break from -PRON- like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferer and die in a wail of furious entreaty a cry for an iniquitous abandonment a cry which be but the echo of an obscene scrawl which -PRON- have read on the ooze wall of a urinal 
-PRON- have wander into a maze of narrow and dirty street 
from the foul laneway -PRON- hear burst of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of drunken singer

the whore would be just come out of -PRON- house make ready for the night yawn lazily after -PRON- sleep and settle the hairpin in -PRON- cluster of hair 
-PRON- would pass by -PRON- calmly wait for a sudden movement of -PRON- own will or a sudden call to -PRON- sinlove soul from -PRON- soft perfumed flesh 
yet as -PRON- prowl in quest of that call -PRON- sense stultify only by -PRON- desire would note keenly all that wound or shame -PRON- -PRON- eye a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldier stand to attention or a gaudy playbill -PRON- ear the drawl jargon of greet hello bertie any good in -PRON- mind

stephen sit in the front bench of the chapel 
father arnall sit at a table to the left of the altar 
-PRON- wear about -PRON- shoulder a heavy cloak -PRON- pale face be draw and -PRON- voice break with rheum 
the figure of -PRON- old master so strangely rearisen bring back to mind -PRON- life at clongowes the wide playground swarm with boy the square ditch the little cemetery off the main avenue of lime where -PRON- have dream of be bury the firelight on the wall of the infirmary where -PRON- lie sick the sorrowful face of brother michael 
-PRON- soul as these memory come back to -PRON- become again a child soul 
-PRON- be assemble here today -PRON- dear little brother in christ for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the great of saint the apostle of the indie the patron saint also of -PRON- college saint francis xavier 
year after year for much long than any of -PRON- -PRON- dear little boy can remember or than i can remember the boy of this college have meet in this very chapel to make -PRON- annual retreat before the feast day of -PRON- patron saint 
time have go on and bring with -PRON- -PRON- change 
even in the last few year what change can most of -PRON- not remember 
many of the boy who sit in those front bench a few year ago be perhaps now in distant land in the burn tropic or immerse in professional duty or in seminary or voyage over the vast expanse of the deep or -PRON- may be already call by the great god to another life and to the render up of -PRON- stewardship 
and still as the year roll by bring with -PRON- change for good and bad the memory of the great saint be honour by the boy of this college who make every year -PRON- annual retreat on the day precede the feast day set apart by -PRON- holy mother the church to transmit to all the age the name and fame of one of the great son of catholic spain 
now what be the meaning of this word retreat and why be -PRON- allow on all hand to be a most salutary practice for all who desire to lead before god and in the eye of man a truly christian life 
a retreat -PRON- dear boy signify a withdrawal for a while from the care of -PRON- life the care of this workaday world in order to examine the state of -PRON- conscience to reflect on the mystery of holy religion and to understand better why -PRON- be here in this world 
during these few day i intend to put before -PRON- some thought concern the four last thing 
-PRON- be as -PRON- know from -PRON- catechism death judgement hell and heaven 
-PRON- shall try to understand -PRON- fully during these few day so that -PRON- may derive from the understanding of -PRON- a lasting benefit to -PRON- soul 
and remember -PRON- dear boy that -PRON- have be send into this world for one thing and for one thing alone to do holy will and to save -PRON- immortal soul 
all else be worthless 
one thing alone be needful the salvation of one soul 
what doth -PRON- profit a man to gain the whole world if -PRON- suffer the loss of -PRON- immortal soul 
ah -PRON- dear boy believe -PRON- there be nothing in this wretched world that can make up for such a loss will ask -PRON- therefore -PRON- dear boy to put away from -PRON- mind during these few day all worldly thought whether of study or pleasure or ambition and to give all -PRON- attention to the state of -PRON- soul 
i need hardly remind -PRON- that during the day of the retreat all boy be expect to preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud unseemly pleasure 
the eld boy of course will see that this custom be not infringe and i look especially to the prefect and officer of the sodality of -PRON- bless lady and of the sodality of the holy angel to set a good example to -PRON- fellowstudent 
let -PRON- try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint francis with -PRON- whole heart and -PRON- whole mind blessing will then be upon all -PRON- year study 
but above and beyond all let this retreat be one to which -PRON- can look back in after year when maybe -PRON- be far from this college and among very different surrounding to which -PRON- can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thank to god for have grant -PRON- this occasion of lay the first foundation of a pious honourable zealous christian life 
and if as may so happen there be at this moment in these bench any poor soul who have have the unutterable misfortune to lose holy grace and to fall into grievous sin i fervently trust and pray that this retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul 
i pray to god through the merit of -PRON- zealous servant francis xavier that such a soul may be lead to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on saint day of this year may be a last covenant between god and that soul 
for just and unjust for saint and sinner alike may this retreat be a memorable one 
help -PRON- -PRON- dear little brother in christ

-PRON- will live a good life and die a good death believe and know that if -PRON- have sacrifice much in this earthly life -PRON- will be give to -PRON- a hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come in the kingdom without enda bless -PRON- dear boy which i wish -PRON- from -PRON- heart one and all in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 
amen 
as -PRON- walk home with silent companion a thick fog seem to compass -PRON- mind 
-PRON- wait in stupor of mind till -PRON- should lift and reveal what -PRON- have hide 
-PRON- eat -PRON- dinner with surly appetite and when the meal be over and the greasestrewn plate lie abandon on the table -PRON- rise and go to the window clear the thick scum from -PRON- mouth with -PRON- tongue and lick -PRON- from -PRON- lip 
so -PRON- have sink to the state of a beast that lick -PRON- chap after meat 
this be the end and a faint glimmer of fear begin to pierce the fog of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- press -PRON- face against the pane of the window and gaze out into the darken street 
form pass this way and that through the dull light 
and that be life 
the letter of the name of dublin lie heavily upon -PRON- mind push one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence 
-PRON- soul be fatten and congeal into a gross grease plunge ever deeper in -PRON- dull fear into a sombre threaten dusk while the body that be -PRON- stand listless and dishonour gaze out of darken eye helpless perturbed and human for a bovine god to stare upon 
the next day bring death and judgement stir -PRON- soul slowly from -PRON- listless despair 
the faint glimmer of fear become a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blow death into -PRON- soul 
-PRON- suffer -PRON- agony 
-PRON- feel the deathchill touch the extremity and creep onward towards the heart the film of death veil the eye the bright centre of the brain extinguish one by one like lamp the last sweat ooze upon the skin the powerlessness of the die limb the speech thickening and wander and fail the heart throb faintly and more faintly all but vanquish the breath the poor breath the poor helpless human spirit sob and sigh gurgle and rattle in the throat 
no help 
no help himselfhis body to which -PRON- have yield be die 
into the grave with -PRON- 
nail -PRON- down into a wooden box the corpse 
carry -PRON- out of the house on the shoulder of hireling 
thrust -PRON- out of men sight into a long hole in the ground into the grave to rot to feed the mass of -PRON- creeping worm and to be devour by scuttle plumpbellie rat 
and while the friend be still stand in tear by the bedside the soul of the sinner be judge 
at the last moment of consciousness the whole earthly life pass before the vision of the soul and ere -PRON- have time to reflect the body have die and the soul stand terrify before the judgement seat 
god who have long be merciful would then be just 
-PRON- have long be patient plead with the sinful soul give -PRON- time to repent sparing -PRON- yet awhile 
but that time have go 
time be to sin and to enjoy time be to scoff at god and at the warning of -PRON- holy church time be to defy -PRON- majesty to disobey -PRON- command to hoodwink one fellow man to commit sin after sin and to hide one corruption from the sight of man 
but that time be over 
now -PRON- be turn and -PRON- be not to be hoodwink or deceive 
every sin would then come forth from -PRON- lurkingplace the most rebellious against the divine will and the most degrading to -PRON- poor corrupt nature the tiny imperfection and the most heinous atrocity 
what do -PRON- avail then to have be a great emperor a great general a marvellous inventor the most learn of the learn 
all be as one before the judgement seat of god 
-PRON- would reward the good and punish the wicked 
one single instant be enough for the trial of a man soul 
one single instant after the bodys death the soul have be weigh in the balance 
the particular judgement be over and the soul have pass to the abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or have be hurl howl into hell 
nor be that all justice have still to be vindicate before man after the particular there still remain the general judgement 
the last day have come 
doomsday be at hand 
the star of heaven be fall upon the earth like the fig cast by the figtree which the wind have shake 
the sun the great luminary of the universe have become as sackcloth of hair 
the moon be bloodre 
the firmament be as a scroll roll away 
the archangel michael the prince of the heavenly host appear glorious and terrible against the sky 
with one foot on the sea and one foot on the land -PRON- blow from the archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time 
the three blast of the angel fill all the universe 
time be time be but time shall be no more 
at the last blast the soul of universal humanity throng towards the valley of jehosaphat rich and poor gentle and simple wise and foolish good and wicked 
the soul of every human being that have ever exist the soul of all those who shall yet be bear all the son and daughter of adam all be assemble on that supreme day 
and lo the supreme judge be come 
no longer the lowly lamb of god no longer the meek jesus of nazareth no longer the man of sorrow no longer the good shepherd -PRON- be see now come upon the cloud in great power and majesty attend by nine choir of angel angel and archangel principality power and virtue throne and domination cherubim and seraphim god omnipotent god everlaste 
-PRON- speak and -PRON- voice be hear even at the farth limit of space even in the bottomless abyss 
supreme judge from -PRON- sentence there will be and can be no appeal 
-PRON- call the just to -PRON- side bid -PRON- enter into the kingdom the eternity of bliss prepare for -PRON- 
the unjust -PRON- cast from -PRON- cry in -PRON- offended majesty depart from -PRON- ye curse into everlasting fire which be prepare for the devil and -PRON- angel what agony then for the miserable sinner 
friend be tear apart from friend child be tear from -PRON- parent husband from -PRON- wife 
the poor sinner hold out -PRON- arm to those who be dear to -PRON- in this earthly world to those whose simple piety perhaps -PRON- make a mock of to those who counsel -PRON- and try to lead -PRON- on the right path to a kind brother to a love sister to the mother and father who love -PRON- so dearly 
but -PRON- be too late the just turn away from the wretched damn soul which now appear before the eye of all in -PRON- hideous and evil character -PRON- hypocrite -PRON- white sepulchre -PRON- who present a smooth smile face to the world while -PRON- soul within be a foul swamp of sin how will -PRON- fare with -PRON- in that terrible day 
and this day will come shall come must come the day of death and the day of judgement 
-PRON- be appoint unto man to die and after death the judgement 
death be certain 
the time and manner be uncertain whether from long disease or from some unexpected accident the son of god cometh at an hour when -PRON- little expect -PRON- 
be therefore ready every moment see that -PRON- may die at any moment 
death be the end of -PRON- all 
death and judgement bring into the world by the sin of -PRON- first parent be the dark portal that close -PRON- earthly existence the portal that open into the unknown and the unseen portal through which every soul must pass alone unaided save by -PRON- good work without friend or brother or parent or master to help -PRON- alone and trembling 
let that thought be ever before -PRON- mind and then -PRON- can not sin

the wind of the last day blow through -PRON- mind -PRON- sin the jeweleye harlot of -PRON- imagination flee before the hurricane squeak like mouse in -PRON- terror and huddle under a mane of hair 
as -PRON- cross the square walk homeward the light laughter of a girl reach -PRON- burn ear 
the frail gay sound smote -PRON- heart more strongly than a trumpetblast and not dare to lift -PRON- eye -PRON- turn aside and gaze as -PRON- walk into the shadow of the tangled shrub

the chapel be flood by the dull scarlet light that filter through the lower blind and through the fissure between the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light enter like a spear and touch the embossed brass of the candlestick upon the altar that gleam like the battleworn mail armour of angel 
rain be fall on the chapel on the garden on the college 
-PRON- would rain for ever noiselessly 
the water would rise inch by inch cover the grass and shrub cover the tree and house cover the monument and the mountain top 
all life would be choke off noiselessly bird man elephant pig child noiselessly float corpse amid the litter of the wreckage of the world 
forty day and forty night the rain would fall till the water cover the face of the earth 
-PRON- may be 
why not 
hell have enlarge -PRON- soul and open -PRON- mouth without any limitsword take -PRON- dear little brother in christ jesus from the book of isaia fifth chapter fourteenth verse 
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 
amen 
the preacher take a chainless watch from a pocket within -PRON- soutane and have consider -PRON- dial for a moment in silence place -PRON- silently before -PRON- on the table 
-PRON- begin to speak in a quiet tone 
adam and eve -PRON- dear boy be as -PRON- know -PRON- first parent and -PRON- will remember that -PRON- be create by god in order that the seat in heaven leave vacant by the fall of lucifer and -PRON- rebellious angel may be fill again 
lucifer -PRON- be tell be a son of the morning a radiant and mighty angel yet -PRON- fall -PRON- fall and there fall with -PRON- a third part of the host of heaven -PRON- fall and be hurl with -PRON- rebellious angel into hell 
what -PRON- sin be -PRON- can not say 
theologian consider that -PRON- be the sin of pride the sinful thought conceive in an instant non serviam i will not serve that instant be -PRON- ruin 
-PRON- offend the majesty of god by the sinful thought of one instant and god cast -PRON- out of heaven into hell for ever 
adam and eve be then create by god and place in eden in the plain of damascus that lovely garden resplendent with sunlight and colour teem with luxuriant vegetation 
the fruitful earth give -PRON- -PRON- bounty beast and bird be -PRON- willing servant -PRON- know not the ill -PRON- flesh be heir to disease and poverty and death all that a great and generous god could do for -PRON- be do 
but there be one condition impose on -PRON- by god obedience to -PRON- word 
-PRON- be not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree 
alas -PRON- dear little boy -PRON- too fall 
the devil once a shine angel a son of the morning now a foul fiend come in the shape of a serpent the subtle of all the beast of the field 
-PRON- envy -PRON- 
-PRON- the fall great one could not bear to think that man a being of clay should possess the inheritance which -PRON- by -PRON- sin have forfeit for ever 
-PRON- come to the woman the weak vessel and pour the poison of -PRON- eloquence into -PRON- ear promise the blasphemy of that if -PRON- and adam eat of the forbid fruit -PRON- would become as god nay as god -PRON- 
eve yield to the wile of the arch tempter 
-PRON- eat the apple and give -PRON- also to adam who have not the moral courage to resist -PRON- 
the poison tongue of satan have do -PRON- work 
-PRON- fall 
and then the voice of god be hear in that garden call -PRON- creature man to account and michael prince of the heavenly host with a sword of flame in -PRON- hand appear before the guilty pair and drive -PRON- forth from eden into the world the world of sickness and striving of cruelty and disappointment of labour and hardship to earn -PRON- bread in the sweat of -PRON- brow 
but even then how merciful be god 
-PRON- take pity on -PRON- poor degraded parent and promise that in the fullness of time -PRON- would send down from heaven one who would redeem -PRON- make -PRON- once more child of god and heir to the kingdom of heaven and that one that redeemer of fallen man be to be only beget son the second person of the most blessed trinity the eternal word 
-PRON- come 
-PRON- be bear of a virgin pure mary the virgin mother 
-PRON- be bear in a poor cowhouse in judea and live as a humble carpenter for thirty year until the hour of -PRON- mission have come 
and then fill with love for man -PRON- go forth and call to man to hear the new gospel 
do -PRON- listen 
yes -PRON- listen but would not hear 
-PRON- be seize and bind like a common criminal mock at as a fool set aside to give place to a public robber scourge with five thousand lash crown with a crown of thorn hustle through the street by the jewish rabble and the roman soldiery strip of -PRON- garment and hang upon a gibbet and -PRON- side be pierce with a lance and from the wounded body of -PRON- lord water and blood issue continually 
yet even then in that hour of supreme agony -PRON- merciful redeemer have pity for mankind 
yet even there on the hill of calvary -PRON- found the holy catholic church against which -PRON- be promise the gate of hell shall not prevail 
-PRON- found -PRON- upon the rock of age and endow -PRON- with -PRON- grace with sacrament and sacrifice and promise that if man would obey the word of -PRON- church -PRON- would still enter into eternal life but if after all that have be do for -PRON- -PRON- still persist in -PRON- wickedness there remain for -PRON- an eternity of torment hell 
the preacher voice sink 
-PRON- pause join -PRON- palm for an instant part -PRON- 
then -PRON- resume now let -PRON- try for a moment to realise as far as -PRON- can the nature of that abode of the damn which the justice of an offended god have call into existence for the eternal punishment of sinner 
hell be a strait and dark and foulsmelle prison an abode of demon and lose soul fill with fire and smoke 
the straitness of this prison house be expressly design by god to punish those who refuse to be bind by -PRON- law 
in earthly prison the poor captive have at least some liberty of movement be -PRON- only within the four wall of -PRON- cell or in the gloomy yard of -PRON- prison 
not so in hell 
there by reason of the great number of the damn the prisoner be heap together in -PRON- awful prison the wall of which be say to be four thousand mile thick and the damn be so utterly bind and helpless that as a blessed saint saint anselm write in -PRON- book on similitude -PRON- be not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaw -PRON- 
-PRON- lie in exterior darkness 
for remember the fire of hell give forth no light 
as at the command of god the fire of the babylonian furnace lose -PRON- heat but not -PRON- light so at the command of god the fire of hell while retain the intensity of -PRON- heat burn eternally in darkness 
-PRON- be a neverending storm of darkness dark flame and dark smoke of burn brimstone amid which the body be heap one upon another without even a glimpse of air 
of all the plague with which the land of the pharaohs be smite one plague alone that of darkness be call horrible 
what name then shall -PRON- give to the darkness of hell which be to last not for three day alone but for all eternity 
the horror of this strait and dark prison be increase by -PRON- awful stench 
all the filth of the world all the offal and scum of the world -PRON- be tell shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day have purge the world 
the brimstone too which burn there in such prodigious quantity fill all hell with -PRON- intolerable stench and the body of the damn -PRON- exhale such a pestilential odour that as saint bonaventure say one of -PRON- alone would suffice to infect the whole world 
the very air of this world that pure element become foul and unbreathable when -PRON- have be long enclose 
consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell 
imagine some foul and putrid corpse that have lie rot and decomposing in the grave a jellylike mass of liquid corruption 
imagine such a corpse a prey to flame devour by the fire of burn brimstone and give off dense choke fume of nauseous loathsome decomposition 
and then imagine this sicken stench multiply a millionfold and a millionfold again from the million upon million of fetid carcass mass together in the reek darkness a huge and rot human fungus 
imagine all this and -PRON- will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell 
but this stench be not horrible though -PRON- be the great physical torment to which the damn be subject 
the torment of fire be the great torment to which the tyrant have ever subject -PRON- fellow creature 
place -PRON- finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and -PRON- will feel the pain of fire 
but -PRON- earthly fire be create by god for the benefit of man to maintain in -PRON- the spark of life and to help -PRON- in the useful art whereas the fire of hell be of another quality and be create by god to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner 
-PRON- earthly fire also consume more or less rapidly accord as the object which -PRON- attack be more or less combustible so that human ingenuity have even succeed in invent chemical preparation to check or frustrate -PRON- action 
but the sulphurous brimstone which burn in hell be a substance which be specially design to burn for ever and for ever with unspeakable fury 
moreover -PRON- earthly fire destroy at the same time as -PRON- burn so that the more intense -PRON- be the short be -PRON- duration but the fire of hell have this property that -PRON- preserve that which -PRON- burn and though -PRON- rage with incredible intensity -PRON- rage for ever 
-PRON- earthly fire again no matter how fierce or widespread -PRON- may be be always of a limited extent but the lake of fire in hell be boundless shoreless and bottomless 
-PRON- be on record that the devil -PRON- when ask the question by a certain soldier be oblige to confess that if a whole mountain be throw into the burn ocean of hell -PRON- would be burn up in an instant like a piece of wax 
and this terrible fire will not afflict the body of the damn only from without but each lose soul will be a hell unto -PRON- the boundless fire rage in -PRON- very vital how terrible be the lot of those wretched being 
the blood seethe and boil in the vein the brain be boil in the skull the heart in the breast glowing and burst the bowel a redhot mass of burn pulp the tender eye flame like molten ball 
and yet what i have say as to the strength and quality and boundlessness of this fire be as nothing when compare to -PRON- intensity an intensity which -PRON- have as be the instrument choose by divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike 
-PRON- be a fire which proceed directly from the ire of god work not of -PRON- own activity but as an instrument of divine vengeance 
as the water of baptism cleanse the soul with the body so do the fire of punishment torture the spirit with the flesh 
every sense of the flesh be torture and every faculty of the soul therewith the eye with impenetrable utter darkness the nose with noisome odour the ear with yell and howl and execration the taste with foul matter leprous corruption nameless suffocate filth the touch with redhot goad and spike with cruel tongue of flame 
and through the several torment of the sense the immortal soul be torture eternally in -PRON- very essence amid the league upon league of glow fire kindle in the abyss by the offended majesty of the omnipotent god and fan into everlasting and everincrease fury by the breath of the anger of the godhead 
consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison be increase by the company of the damn -PRON- 
evil company on earth be so noxious that the plant as if by instinct withdraw from the company of whatsoever be deadly or hurtful to -PRON- 
in hell all law be overturnedthere be no thought of family or country of tie of relationship 
the damned howl and scream at one another -PRON- torture and rage intensify by the presence of being torture and rage like -PRON- 
all sense of humanity be forget 
the yell of the suffering sinner fill the remote corner of the vast abyss 
the mouth of the damn be full of blasphemy against god and of hatred for -PRON- fellow sufferer and of curse against those soul which be -PRON- accomplice in sin 
in olden time -PRON- be the custom to punish the parricide the man who have raise -PRON- murderous hand against -PRON- father by cast -PRON- into the depth of the sea in a sack in which be place a cock a monkey and a serpent 
the intention of those lawgiver who frame such a law which seem cruel in -PRON- time be to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beast 
but what be the fury of those dumb beast compare with the fury of execration which burst from the parched lip and ache throat of the damn in hell when -PRON- behold in -PRON- companion in misery those who aid and abet -PRON- in sin those whose word sow the first seed of evil thinking and evil live in -PRON- mind those whose immodest suggestion lead -PRON- on to sin those whose eye tempt and allure -PRON- from the path of virtue 
-PRON- turn upon those accomplice and upbraid -PRON- and curse -PRON- 
but -PRON- be helpless and hopeless -PRON- be too late now for repentance 
last of all consider the frightful torment to those damn soul tempter and tempt alike of the company of the devil 
these devil will afflict the damn in two way by -PRON- presence and by -PRON- reproach 
-PRON- can have no idea of how horrible these devil be 
saint catherine of siena once see a devil and -PRON- have write that rather than look again for one single instant on such a frightful monster -PRON- would prefer to walk until the end of -PRON- life along a track of red coal 
these devil who be once beautiful angel have become as hideous and ugly as -PRON- once be beautiful 
-PRON- mock and jeer at the lose soul whom -PRON- drag down to ruin 
-PRON- be -PRON- the foul demon who be make in hell the voice of conscience 
why do -PRON- sin 
why do -PRON- lend an ear to the tempting of friend 
why do -PRON- turn aside from -PRON- pious practice and good work 
why do -PRON- not shun the occasion of sin 
why do -PRON- not leave that evil companion 
why do -PRON- not give up that lewd habit that impure habit 
why do -PRON- not listen to the counsel of -PRON- confessor 
why do -PRON- not even after -PRON- have fall the first or the second or the third or the fourth or the hundredth time repent of -PRON- evil way and turn to god who only wait for -PRON- repentance to absolve -PRON- of -PRON- sin 
now the time for repentance have go by 
time be time be but time shall be no more 
time be to sin in secrecy to indulge in that sloth and pride to covet the unlawful to yield to the prompting of -PRON- low nature to live like the beast of the field nay bad than the beast of the field for -PRON- at least be but brute and have no reason to guide -PRON- time be but time shall be no more 
god speak to -PRON- by so many voice but -PRON- would not hear 
-PRON- would not crush out that pride and anger in -PRON- heart -PRON- would not restore those illgotten good -PRON- would not obey the precept of -PRON- holy church nor attend to -PRON- religious duty -PRON- would not abandon those wicked companion -PRON- would not avoid those dangerous temptation 
such be the language of those fiendish tormentor word of taunt and of reproach of hatred and of disgust 
of disgust yes 
for even -PRON- the very devil when -PRON- sin sin by such a sin as alone be compatible with such angelical nature a rebellion of the intellect and -PRON- even -PRON- the foul devil must turn away revolt and disgust from the contemplation of those unspeakable sin by which degrade man outrage and defile the temple of the holy ghost defile and pollute -PRON- -PRON- dear little brother in christ may -PRON- never be -PRON- lot to hear that language 
may -PRON- never be -PRON- lot i say 
in the last day of terrible reckon i pray fervently to god that not a single soul of those who be in this chapel today may be find among those miserable being whom the great judge shall command to depart for ever from -PRON- sight that not one of -PRON- may ever hear ring in -PRON- ear the awful sentence of rejection depart from -PRON- ye curse into everlasting fire which be prepare for the devil and -PRON- angel -PRON- come down the aisle of the chapel -PRON- leg shake and the scalp of -PRON- head trembling as though -PRON- have be touch by ghostly finger 
-PRON- pass up the staircase and into the corridor along the wall of which the overcoat and waterproof hang like gibbet malefactor headless and dripping and shapeless 
and at every step -PRON- fear that -PRON- have already die that -PRON- soul have be wrench forth of the sheath of -PRON- body that -PRON- be plunge headlong through space 
-PRON- could not grip the floor with -PRON- foot and sit heavily at -PRON- desk opening one of -PRON- book at random and pore over -PRON- 
every word for -PRON- 
-PRON- be true 
god be almighty 
god could call -PRON- now call -PRON- as -PRON- sit at -PRON- desk before -PRON- have time to be conscious of the summon 
god have call -PRON- 
yes 
what 
yes 
-PRON- flesh shrink together as -PRON- feel the approach of the ravenous tongue of flame dry up as -PRON- feel about -PRON- the swirl of stifle air 
-PRON- have die 
yes 
-PRON- be judge 
a wave of fire sweep through -PRON- body the first 
again a wave 
-PRON- brain begin to glow 
another 
-PRON- brain be simmer and bubble within the crack tenement of the skull 
flame burst forth from -PRON- skull like a corolla shriek like voice hell 
hell 
hell 
hell 
hell 
voice speak near -PRON- on hell suppose -PRON- rub -PRON- into -PRON- well 
-PRON- bet -PRON- do 
-PRON- put -PRON- all into a blue funk what -PRON- fellow want and plenty of -PRON- to make -PRON- work 
-PRON- lean back weakly in -PRON- desk 
-PRON- have not die 
god have spare -PRON- still 
-PRON- be still in the familiar world of the school 
mr tate and vincent heron stand at the window talk jesting gaze out at the bleak rain move -PRON- head wish -PRON- would clear up 
i have arrange to go for a spin on the bike with some fellow out by malahide 
but the road must be kneedeep 
-PRON- may clear up sir 
the voice that -PRON- know so well the common word the quiet of the classroom when the voice pause and the silence be fill by the sound of softly browse cattle as the other boy munch -PRON- lunch tranquilly lull -PRON- ache soul 
there be still time 
mary refuge of sinner intercede for -PRON- 
virgin undefile save -PRON- from the gulf of death 
the english lesson begin with the hearing of the history 
royal person favourite intriguer bishop pass like mute phantom behind -PRON- veil of name 
all have die all have be judge 
what do -PRON- profit a man to gain the whole world if -PRON- lose -PRON- soul 
at last -PRON- have understand and human life lie around -PRON- a plain of peace whereon antlike man labour in brotherhood -PRON- dead sleep under quiet mound 
the elbow of -PRON- companion touch -PRON- and -PRON- heart be touch and when -PRON- speak to answer a question of -PRON- master -PRON- hear -PRON- own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition 
-PRON- soul sink back deeper into depth of contrite peace no longer able to suffer the pain of dread and send forth as -PRON- sink a faint prayer 
ah yes -PRON- would still be spare -PRON- would repent in -PRON- heart and be forgive and then those above those in heaven would see what -PRON- would do to make up for the past a whole life every hour of life 
only wait 
all god 
all all 
a messenger come to the door to say that confession be be hear in the chapel 
four boy leave the room and -PRON- hear other pass down the corridor 
a tremulous chill blow round -PRON- heart no strong than a little wind and yet listen and suffer silently -PRON- seem to have lay an ear against the muscle of -PRON- own heart feel -PRON- close and quail listen to the flutter of -PRON- ventricle 
no escape 
-PRON- have to confess to speak out in word what -PRON- have do and think sin after sin 
how 
how 
father the thought slide like a cold shine rapier into -PRON- tender flesh confession 
but not there in the chapel of the college 
-PRON- would confess all every sin of deed and think sincerely but not there among -PRON- school companion 
far away from there in some dark place -PRON- would murmur out -PRON- own shame and -PRON- beseech god humbly not to be offend with -PRON- if -PRON- do not dare to confess in the college chapel and in utter abjection of spirit -PRON- crave forgiveness mutely of the boyish heart about -PRON- 
time pass 
-PRON- sit again in the front bench of the chapel 
the daylight without be already fail and as -PRON- fall slowly through the dull red blind -PRON- seem that the sun of the last day be go down and that all soul be be gather for the judgement be cast away from the sight of thine eye word take -PRON- dear little brother in christ from the book of psalm thirtieth chapter twentythird verse 
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 
amen 
the preacher begin to speak in a quiet friendly tone 
-PRON- face be kind and -PRON- join gently the finger of each hand form a frail cage by the union of -PRON- tip 
this morning -PRON- endeavour in -PRON- reflection upon hell to make what -PRON- holy founder call in -PRON- book of spiritual exercise the composition of place 
-PRON- endeavour that be to imagine with the sense of the mind in -PRON- imagination the material character of that awful place and of the physical torment which all who be in hell endure 
this evening -PRON- shall consider for a few moment the nature of the spiritual torment of hell 
sin remember be a twofold enormity 
-PRON- be a base consent to the prompting of -PRON- corrupt nature to the low instinct to that which be gross and beastlike and -PRON- be also a turning away from the counsel of -PRON- high nature from all that be pure and holy from the holy god -PRON- 
for this reason mortal sin be punish in hell by two different form of punishment physical and spiritual 
now of all these spiritual pain by far the great be the pain of loss so great in fact that in -PRON- -PRON- be a torment great than all the other 
saint thomas the great doctor of the church the angelic doctor as -PRON- be call say that the bad damnation consist in this that the understanding of man be totally deprive of divine light and -PRON- affection obstinately turn away from the goodness of god 
god remember be a be infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful 
in this life -PRON- have not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damn in hell for -PRON- great torment have a full understanding of that which -PRON- have lose and understand that -PRON- have lose -PRON- through -PRON- own sin and have lose -PRON- for ever 
at the very instant of death the bond of the flesh be break asunder and the soul at once fly towards god as towards the centre of -PRON- existence 
remember -PRON- dear little boy -PRON- soul long to be with god 
-PRON- come from god -PRON- live by god -PRON- belong to god -PRON- be -PRON- inalienably -PRON- 
god love with a divine love every human soul and every human soul live in that love 
how could -PRON- be otherwise 
every breath that -PRON- draw every thought of -PRON- brain every instant of life proceed from inexhaustible goodness 
and if -PRON- be pain for a mother to be part from -PRON- child for a man to be exile from hearth and home for friend to be sunder from friend think what pain what anguish -PRON- must be for the poor soul to be spurn from the presence of the supremely good and loving creator who have call that soul into existence from nothingness and sustain -PRON- in life and love -PRON- with an immeasurable love 
this then to be separate for ever from -PRON- great good from god and to feel the anguish of that separation know full well that -PRON- be unchangeable this be the great torment which the create soul be capable of bear pna damni the pain of loss 
the second pain which will afflict the soul of the damn in hell be the pain of conscience 
just as in dead body worm be engender by putrefaction so in the soul of the lose there arise a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin the sting of conscience the worm as pope innocent the third call -PRON- of the triple sting 
the first sting inflict by this cruel worm will be the memory of past pleasure what a dreadful memory will that be 
in the lake of alldevoure flame the proud king will remember the pomp of -PRON- court the wise but wicked man -PRON- library and instrument of research the lover of artistic pleasure -PRON- marble and picture and other art treasure -PRON- who delight in the pleasure of the table -PRON- gorgeous feast -PRON- dish prepare with such delicacy -PRON- choice wine the miser will remember -PRON- hoard of gold the robber -PRON- illgotten wealth the angry and revengeful and merciless murderer -PRON- deed of blood and violence in which -PRON- revel the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasure in which -PRON- delight 
-PRON- will remember all this and loathe -PRON- and -PRON- sin 
for how miserable will all those pleasure seem to the soul condemn to suffer in hellfire for age and age 
how -PRON- will rage and fume to think that -PRON- have lose the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth for a few piece of metal for vain honour for bodily comfort for a tingling of the nerve 
-PRON- will repent indeed and this be the second sting of the worm of conscience a late and fruitless sorrow for sin commit 
divine justice insist that the understanding of those miserable wretch be fix continually on the sin of which -PRON- be guilty and moreover as saint augustine point out god will impart to -PRON- -PRON- own knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to -PRON- in all -PRON- hideous malice as -PRON- appear to the eye of god -PRON- 
-PRON- will behold -PRON- sin in all -PRON- foulness and repent but -PRON- will be too late and then -PRON- will bewail the good occasion which -PRON- neglect 
this be the last and deep and most cruel sting of the worm of conscience 
the conscience will say -PRON- have time and opportunity to repent and would not 
-PRON- be bring up religiously by -PRON- parent 
-PRON- have the sacrament and grace and indulgence of the church to aid -PRON- 
-PRON- have the minister of god to preach to -PRON- to call -PRON- back when -PRON- have stray to forgive -PRON- -PRON- sin no matter how many how abominable if only -PRON- have confess and repent 
no 
-PRON- would not 
-PRON- flout the minister of holy religion -PRON- turn -PRON- back on the confessional -PRON- wallow deep and deep in the mire of sin 
god appeal to -PRON- threaten -PRON- entreat -PRON- to return to -PRON- what shame what misery 
the ruler of the universe entreat -PRON- a creature of clay to love -PRON- who make -PRON- and to keep -PRON- law 
no 
-PRON- would not 
and now though -PRON- be to flood all hell with -PRON- tear if -PRON- could still weep all that sea of repentance would not gain for -PRON- what a single tear of true repentance shed during -PRON- mortal life would have gain for -PRON- 
-PRON- implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to repent in vain 
that time be go go for ever 
such be the threefold sting of conscience the viper which gnaw the very heart core of the wretch in hell so that fill with hellish fury -PRON- curse -PRON- for -PRON- folly and curse the evil companion who have bring -PRON- to such ruin and curse the devil who tempt -PRON- in life and now mock -PRON- in eternity and even revile and curse the supreme be whose goodness and patience -PRON- scorn and slight but whose justice and power -PRON- can not evade 
the next spiritual pain to which the damn be subject be the pain of extension 
man in this earthly life though -PRON- be capable of many evil be not capable of -PRON- all at once inasmuch as one evil correct and counteract another just as one poison frequently correct another 
in hell on the contrary one torment instead of counteract another lend -PRON- still great force and moreover as the internal faculty be more perfect than the external sense so be -PRON- more capable of suffering 
just as every sense be afflict with a fitting torment so be every spiritual faculty the fancy with horrible image the sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage the mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even than the exterior darkness which reign in that dreadful prison 
the malice impotent though -PRON- be which possess these demon soul be an evil of boundless extension of limitless duration a frightful state of wickedness which -PRON- can scarcely realise unless -PRON- bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred god bear to -PRON- 
oppose to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with -PRON- -PRON- have the pain of intensity 
hell be the centre of evil and as -PRON- know thing be more intense at -PRON- centre than at -PRON- remote point 
there be no contrary or admixture of any kind to temper or soften in the least the pain of hell 
nay thing which be good in -PRON- become evil in hell 
company elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflict will be there a continual torment knowledge so much long for as the chief good of the intellect will there be hate bad than ignorance light so much covet by all creature from the lord of creation down to the humble plant in the forest will be loathe intensely 
in this life -PRON- sorrow be either not very long or not very great because nature either overcome -PRON- by habit or put an end to -PRON- by sink under -PRON- weight 
but in hell the torment can not be overcome by habit for while -PRON- be of terrible intensity -PRON- be at the same time of continual variety each pain so to speak take fire from another and reendowe that which have enkindle -PRON- with a still fiercer flame 
nor can nature escape from these intense and various torture by succumb to -PRON- for the soul be sustain and maintain in evil so that -PRON- suffering may be the great 
boundless extension of torment incredible intensity of suffer unceasing variety of torturethis be what the divine majesty so outrage by sinner demand this be what the holiness of heaven slight and set aside for the lustful and low pleasure of the corrupt flesh require this be what the blood of the innocent lamb of god shed for the redemption of sinner trample upon by the vile of the vile insist upon 
last and crowning torture of all the torture of that awful place be the eternity of hell 
eternity dread and dire word 
eternity 
what mind of man can understand -PRON- 
and remember -PRON- be an eternity of pain 
even though the pain of hell be not so terrible as -PRON- be yet -PRON- would become infinite as -PRON- be destine to last for ever 
but while -PRON- be everlaste -PRON- be at the same time as -PRON- know intolerably intense unbearably extensive 
to bear even the sting of an insect for all eternity would be a dreadful torment 
what must -PRON- be then to bear the manifold torture of hell for ever 
for ever 
for all eternity 
not for a year or for an age but for ever 
try to imagine the awful meaning of this 
-PRON- have often see the sand on the seashore 
how fine be -PRON- tiny grain 
and how many of those tiny little grain go to make up the small handful which a child grasps in -PRON- play 
now imagine a mountain of that sand a million mile high reach from the earth to the farth heaven and a million mile broad extend to remote space and a million mile in thickness and imagine such an enormous mass of countless particle of sand multiply as often as there be leave in the forest drop of water in the mighty ocean feather on bird scale on fish hair on animal atom in the vast expanse of the air and imagine that at the end of every million year a little bird come to that mountain and carry away in -PRON- beak a tiny grain of that sand 
how many million upon million of century would pass before that bird have carry away even a square foot of that mountain how many eon upon eon of age before -PRON- have carry away all 
yet at the end of that immense stretch of time not even one instant of eternity could be say to have end 
at the end of all those billion and trillion of year eternity would have scarcely begin 
and if that mountain rise again after -PRON- have be all carry away and if the bird come again and carry -PRON- all away again grain by grain and if -PRON- so rise and sink as many time as there be star in the sky atom in the air drop of water in the sea leave on the tree feather upon bird scale upon fish hair upon animal at the end of all those innumerable rising and sinking of that immeasurably vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be say to have end even then at the end of such a period after that eon of time the mere thought of which make -PRON- very brain reel dizzily eternity would scarcely have begin holy saint one of -PRON- own father i believe -PRON- be be once vouchsafe a vision of hell 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- stand in the midst of a great hall dark and silent save for the ticking of a great clock 
the ticking go on unceasingly and -PRON- seem to this saint that the sound of the ticking be the ceaseless repetition of the word ever never ever never 
ever to be in hell never to be in heaven ever to be shut off from the presence of god never to enjoy the beatific vision ever to be eat with flame gnaw by vermin goad with burn spike never to be free from those pain ever to have the conscience upbraid one the memory enrage the mind fill with darkness and despair never to escape ever to curse and revile the foul demon who gloat fiendishly over the misery of -PRON- dupe never to behold the shine raiment of the bless spirit ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to god for an instant a single instant of respite from such awful agony never to receive even for an instant pardon ever to suffer never to enjoy ever to be damn never to be save ever never ever never what a dreadful punishment 
an eternity of endless agony of endless bodily and spiritual torment without one ray of hope without one moment of cessation of agony limitless in intensity of torment infinitely varied of torture that sustain eternally that which -PRON- eternally devour of anguish that everlastingly prey upon the spirit while -PRON- rack the flesh an eternity every instant of which be -PRON- an eternity of woe 
such be the terrible punishment decree for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and a just god 
yes a just god 
man reason always as man be astonish that god should mete out an everlasting and infinite punishment in the fire of hell for a single grievous sin 
-PRON- reason thus because blind by the gross illusion of the flesh and the darkness of human understanding -PRON- be unable to comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin 
-PRON- reason thus because -PRON- be unable to comprehend that even venial sin be of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent creator could end all the evil and misery in the world the war the disease the robbery the crime the death the murder on condition that -PRON- allow a single venial sin to pass unpunished a single venial sin a lie an angry look a moment of wilful sloth -PRON- the great omnipotent god could not do so because sin be -PRON- in thought or deed be a transgression of -PRON- law and god would not be god if -PRON- do not punish the transgressor sin an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect make lucifer and a third part of the cohort of angel fall from -PRON- glory 
a sin an instant of folly and weakness drive adam and eve out of eden and bring death and suffer into the world 
to retrieve the consequence of that sin the only begotten son of god come down to earth live and suffer and die a most painful death hang for three hour on the cross -PRON- dear little brother in christ jesus will -PRON- then offend that good redeemer and provoke -PRON- anger 
will -PRON- trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse 
will -PRON- spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love 
will -PRON- too like the cruel jew and the brutal soldier mock that gentle and compassionate saviour who trod alone for -PRON- sake the awful winepress of sorrow 
every word of sin be a wound in -PRON- tender side 
every sinful act be a thorn pierce -PRON- head 
every impure think deliberately yield to be a keen lance transfixing that sacred and love heart 
no no 
-PRON- be impossible for any human be to do that which offend so deeply the divine majesty that which be punish by an eternity of agony that which crucifie again the son of god and make a mockery of -PRON- pray to god that -PRON- poor word may have avail today to confirm in holiness those who be in a state of grace to strengthen the wavering to lead back to the state of grace the poor soul that have stray if any such be among -PRON- 
i pray to god and do -PRON- pray with -PRON- that -PRON- may repent of -PRON- sin 
i will ask -PRON- now all of -PRON- to repeat after -PRON- the act of contrition kneel here in this humble chapel in the presence of god 
-PRON- be there in the tabernacle burn with love for mankind ready to comfort the afflicted 
be not afraid 
no matter how many or how foul the sin if -PRON- only repent of -PRON- -PRON- will be forgive -PRON- 
let no worldly shame hold -PRON- back 
god be still the merciful lord who wish not the eternal death of the sinner but rather that -PRON- be convert and live 
-PRON- call -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- 
-PRON- make -PRON- out of nothing 
-PRON- love -PRON- as only a god can love 
-PRON- arm be open to receive -PRON- even though -PRON- have sin against -PRON- 
come to -PRON- poor sinner poor vain and err sinner 
now be the acceptable time 
now be the hour 
the priest rise and turn towards the altar kneel upon the step before the tabernacle in the fall gloom 
-PRON- wait till all in the chapel have knelt and every least noise be still 
then raise -PRON- head -PRON- repeat the act of contrition phrase by phrase with fervour 
the boy answer -PRON- phrase by phrase 
stephen -PRON- tongue cleave to -PRON- palate bow -PRON- head pray with -PRON- heart my god -PRON- god be heartily sorry be heartily sorry for have offend thee for have offend thee and i detest -PRON- sin and i detest -PRON- sin above every other evil above every other evil because -PRON- displease thee -PRON- god because -PRON- displease thee -PRON- god who art so deserve who art so deserve of all -PRON- love of all -PRON- love and i firmly purpose and i firmly purpose by thy holy grace by thy holy grace never more to offend thee never more to offend thee and to amend -PRON- life and to amend -PRON- life -PRON- go up to -PRON- room after dinner in order to be alone with -PRON- soul and at every step -PRON- soul seem to sigh at every step -PRON- soul mount with -PRON- foot sigh in the ascent through a region of viscid gloom 
-PRON- halt on the landing before the door and then grasp the porcelain knob open the door quickly 
-PRON- wait in fear -PRON- soul pine within -PRON- pray silently that death may not touch -PRON- brow as -PRON- pass over the threshold that the fiend that inhabit darkness may not be give power over -PRON- 
-PRON- wait still at the threshold as at the entrance to some dark cave 
face be there eye -PRON- wait and watch 
-PRON- know perfectly well of course that though -PRON- be bind to come to the light -PRON- would find considerable difficulty in endeavour to try to induce -PRON- to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so -PRON- know of course perfectly face wait and watch murmurous voice fill the dark shell of the cave 
-PRON- fear intensely in spirit and in flesh but raise -PRON- head bravely -PRON- stride into the room firmly 
a doorway a room the same room same window 
-PRON- tell -PRON- calmly that those word have absolutely no sense which have seem to rise murmurously from the dark 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be simply -PRON- room with the door open 
-PRON- close the door and walk swiftly to the bed knelt beside -PRON- and cover -PRON- face with -PRON- hand 
-PRON- hand be cold and damp and -PRON- limb ache with chill 
bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset -PRON- route -PRON- thought 
why be -PRON- kneel there like a child say -PRON- evening prayer 
to be alone with -PRON- soul to examine -PRON- conscience to meet -PRON- sin face to face to recall -PRON- time and manner and circumstance to weep over -PRON- 
-PRON- could not weep 
-PRON- could not summon -PRON- to -PRON- memory 
-PRON- feel only an ache of soul and body -PRON- whole be memory will understand flesh benumbed and weary 
that be the work of devil to scatter -PRON- thought and overcloud -PRON- conscience assail -PRON- at the gate of the cowardly and sincorrupted flesh and pray god timidly to forgive -PRON- -PRON- weakness -PRON- crawl up on to the bed and wrap the blanket closely about -PRON- cover -PRON- face again with -PRON- hand 
-PRON- have sin 
-PRON- have sin so deeply against heaven and before god that -PRON- be not worthy to be call child 
could -PRON- be that -PRON- stephen dedalus have do those thing 
-PRON- conscience sigh in answer 
yes -PRON- have do -PRON- secretly filthily time after time and harden in sinful impenitence -PRON- have dare to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle -PRON- while -PRON- soul within be a live mass of corruption 
how come -PRON- that god have not strike -PRON- dead 
the leprous company of -PRON- sin close about -PRON- breathe upon -PRON- bend over -PRON- from all side 
-PRON- strive to forget -PRON- in an act of prayer huddle -PRON- limb closer together and bind down -PRON- eyelid but the sense of -PRON- soul would not be bind and though -PRON- eye be shut fast -PRON- see the place where -PRON- have sin and though -PRON- ear be tightly cover -PRON- hear 
-PRON- desire with all -PRON- will not to hear or see 
-PRON- desire till -PRON- frame shake under the strain of -PRON- desire and until the sense of -PRON- soul close 
-PRON- close for an instant and then open 
-PRON- see 
a field of stiff weed and thistle and tufte nettlebunche 
thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lie batter canister and clot and coil of solid excrement 
a faint marshlight struggle upwards from all the ordure through the bristle greygreen weed 
an evil smell faint and foul as the light curl upwards sluggishly out of the canister and from the stale crust dung 
creature be in the field one three six creature be move in the field hither and thither 
goatish creature with human face hornybrowe lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber 
the malice of evil glitter in -PRON- hard eye as -PRON- move hither and thither trail -PRON- long tail behind -PRON- 
a rictus of cruel malignity light up greyly -PRON- old bony face

-PRON- move in slow circle circle closer and closer to enclose to enclose soft language issue from -PRON- lip -PRON- long swishing tail besmear with stale shite thrust upwards -PRON- terrific face 
help 
-PRON- fling the blanket from -PRON- madly to free -PRON- face and neck

at the washstand a convulsion seize -PRON- within and clasp -PRON- cold forehead wildly -PRON- vomit profusely in agony 
when the fit have spend -PRON- -PRON- walk weakly to the window and lift the sash sit in a corner of the embrasure and lean -PRON- elbow upon the sill 
the rain have draw off and amid the move vapour from point to point of light the city be spin about -PRON- a soft cocoon of yellowish haze 
heaven be still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to breathe as in a thicket drench with shower and amid peace and shimmer light and quiet fragrance -PRON- make a covenant with -PRON- heart 
-PRON- pray -PRON- once have mean to come on earth in heavenly glory but -PRON- sin and then -PRON- could not safely visit -PRON- but with a shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for -PRON- be god 
so -PRON- come -PRON- in weakness not in power and -PRON- send thee a creature in -PRON- stead with a creature comeliness and lustre suited to -PRON- state 
and now thy very face and form dear mother speak to -PRON- of the eternal not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which be thy emblem bright and musical breathing purity telling of heaven and infuse peace harbringer of day light of the pilgrim 
lead -PRON- still as thou hast lead 
in the dark night across the bleak wilderness guide -PRON- on to -PRON- lord jesus guide -PRON- home -PRON- eye be dim with tear and look humbly up to heaven -PRON- weep for the innocence -PRON- have lose 
when evening have fall -PRON- leave the house and the first touch of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as -PRON- close behind -PRON- make ache again -PRON- conscience lull by prayer and tear 
confess 
confess 
-PRON- be not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a prayer 
-PRON- have to kneel before the minister of the holy ghost and tell over -PRON- hide sin truly and repentantly 
before -PRON- hear again the footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as -PRON- open to let -PRON- in before -PRON- see again the table in the kitchen set for supper -PRON- would have knelt and confess 
-PRON- be quite simple 
the ache of conscience cease and -PRON- walk onward swiftly through the dark street 
there be so many flagstone on the footpath of that street and so many street in that city and so many city in the world 
yet eternity have no end 
-PRON- be in mortal sin 
even once be a mortal sin 
-PRON- could happen in an instant 
but how so quickly 
by see or by think of see 
the eye see the thing without have wish first to see 
then in an instant -PRON- happen 
but do that part of the body understand or what 
the serpent the most subtle beast of the field 
-PRON- must understand when -PRON- desire in one instant and then prolong -PRON- own desire instant after instant sinfully 
-PRON- feel and understand and desire 
what a horrible thing 
who make -PRON- to be like that a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially 
be that then -PRON- or an inhuman thing move by a low soul 
-PRON- soul sicken at the thought of a torpid snaky life feed -PRON- out of the tender marrow of -PRON- life and fattening upon the slime of lust why be that so why 
-PRON- cower in the shadow of the thought abase -PRON- in the awe of god who have make all thing and all man 
madness 
who could think such a thought 
and cower in darkness and abject -PRON- pray mutely to -PRON- guardian angel to drive away with -PRON- sword the demon that be whisper to -PRON- brain 
the whisper cease and -PRON- know then clearly that -PRON- own soul have sin in thought and word and deed wilfully through -PRON- own body

-PRON- have to confess every sin 
how could -PRON- utter in word to the priest what -PRON- have do 
must must 
or how could -PRON- explain without die of shame 
or how could -PRON- have do such thing without shame 
a madman 
confess -PRON- would indeed to be free and sinless again 
perhaps the priest would know dear god 
-PRON- walk on and on through illlit street fear to stand still for a moment lest -PRON- may seem that -PRON- hold back from what await -PRON- fear to arrive at that towards which -PRON- still turn with longing 
how beautiful must be a soul in the state of grace when god look upon -PRON- with love 
frowsy girl sit along the curbstone before -PRON- basket 
-PRON- dank hair hang trail over -PRON- brow 
-PRON- be not beautiful to see as -PRON- crouch in the mire 
but -PRON- soul be see by god and if -PRON- soul be in a state of grace -PRON- be radiant to see and god love -PRON- see -PRON- 
a waste breath of humiliation blow bleakly over -PRON- soul to think of how -PRON- have fall to feel that those soul be dearer to god than -PRON- 
the wind blow over -PRON- and pass on to the myriad and myriad of other soul on whom favour shine now more and now less star now brighter and now dimmer sustained and fail 
and the glimmering soul pass away sustained and fail merge in a move breath 
one soul be lose a tiny soul -PRON- 
-PRON- flicker once and go out forget lost

a few of the faithful still linger pray before one of the sidealtar or kneel in the bench near the confessional 
-PRON- approach timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the church 
the board on which -PRON- kneel be narrow and worn and those who knelt near -PRON- be humble follower of jesus 
jesus too have be bear in poverty and have work in the shop of a carpenter cut board and plane -PRON- and have first speak of the kingdom of god to poor fisherman teach all man to be meek and humble of heart

and -PRON- will promise god now that by -PRON- holy grace -PRON- will never offend -PRON- any more by that wicked sin 
-PRON- will make that solemn promise to god will -PRON- not 
yes father 
the old and weary voice fall like sweet rain upon -PRON- quaking parch heart 
how sweet and sad 
do so -PRON- poor child 
the devil have lead -PRON- astray 
drive -PRON- back to hell when -PRON- tempt -PRON- to dishonour -PRON- body in that waythe foul spirit who hate -PRON- lord 
promise god now that -PRON- will give up that sin that wretche wretched sin 
blind by -PRON- tear and by the light of mercifulness -PRON- bend -PRON- head and hear the grave word of absolution speak and see the priest hand raise above -PRON- in token of forgiveness 
god bless -PRON- -PRON- child 
pray for -PRON- 
-PRON- kneel to say -PRON- penance pray in a corner of the dark nave and -PRON- prayer ascend to heaven from -PRON- purified heart like perfume stream upwards from a heart of white rose 
the muddy street be gay 
-PRON- stride homeward conscious of an invisible grace pervade and make light -PRON- limb 
in spite of all -PRON- have do -PRON- 
-PRON- have confess and god have pardon -PRON- 
-PRON- soul be make fair and holy once more holy and happy 
-PRON- would be beautiful to die if god so willed 
-PRON- be beautiful to live in grace a life of peace and virtue and forbearance with other 
-PRON- sit by the fire in the kitchen not dare to speak for happiness 
till that moment -PRON- have not know how beautiful and peaceful life could be 
the green square of paper pin round the lamp cast down a tender shade 
on the dresser be a plate of sausage and white pudding and on the shelf there be egg 
-PRON- would be for the breakfast in the morning after the communion in the college chapel 
white pudding and egg and sausage and cup of tea 
how simple and beautiful be life after all 
and life lie all before -PRON- 
in a dream -PRON- fall asleep 
in a dream -PRON- rise and see that -PRON- be morning 
in a wake dream -PRON- go through the quiet morning towards the college 
the boy be all there kneel in -PRON- place 
-PRON- kneel among -PRON- happy and shy 
the altar be heap with fragrant masse of white flower and in the morning light the pale flame of the candle among the white flower be clear and silent as -PRON- own soul 
-PRON- kneel before the altar with -PRON- classmate hold the altar cloth with -PRON- over a live rail of hand 
-PRON- hand be tremble and -PRON- soul tremble as -PRON- hear the priest pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant 
corpus domini nostri 
could -PRON- be 
-PRON- kneel there sinless and timid and -PRON- would hold upon -PRON- tongue the host and god would enter -PRON- purified body 
in vitam eternam 
amen another life 
a life of grace and virtue and happiness 
-PRON- be true 
-PRON- be not a dream from which -PRON- would wake 
the past be past 
corpus domini nostri 
the ciborium have come to -PRON- 
chapter sunday be dedicated to the mystery of the holy trinity monday to the holy ghost tuesday to the guardian angel wednesday to saint joseph thursday to the most blessed sacrament of the altar friday to the suffer jesus saturday to the bless virgin mary 
every morning -PRON- hallow -PRON- anew in the presence of some holy image or mystery 
-PRON- day begin with an heroic offering of -PRON- every moment of thought or action for the intention of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass 
the raw morning air whet -PRON- resolute piety and often as -PRON- kneel among the few worshipper at the sidealtar follow with -PRON- interleave prayerbook the murmur of the priest -PRON- glance up for an instant towards the vested figure stand in the gloom between the two candle which be the old and the new testament and imagine that -PRON- be kneel at mass in the catacomb 
-PRON- daily life be lay out in devotional area 
by mean of ejaculation and prayer -PRON- store up ungrudgingly for the soul in purgatory century of day and quarantine and year yet the spiritual triumph which -PRON- feel in achieve with ease so many fabulous age of canonical penance do not wholly reward -PRON- zeal of prayer since -PRON- could never know how much temporal punishment -PRON- have remit by way of suffrage for the agonising soul and fearful lest in the midst of the purgatorial fire which differ from the infernal only in that -PRON- be not everlaste -PRON- penance may avail no more than a drop of moisture -PRON- drive -PRON- soul daily through an increase circle of work of supererogation 
every part of -PRON- day divide by what -PRON- regard now as the duty of -PRON- station in life circle about -PRON- own centre of spiritual energy 
-PRON- life seem to have draw near to eternity every thought word and deed every instance of consciousness could be make to revibrate radiantly in heaven and at time -PRON- sense of such immediate repercussion be so lively that -PRON- seem to feel -PRON- soul in devotion press like finger the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of -PRON- purchase start forth immediately in heaven not as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slend flower 
the rosary too which -PRON- say constantlyfor -PRON- carry -PRON- bead loose in -PRON- trouser pocket that -PRON- may tell -PRON- as -PRON- walk the streetstransforme -PRON- into coronal of flower of such vague unearthly texture that -PRON- seem to -PRON- as hueless and odourless as -PRON- be nameless 
-PRON- offer up each of -PRON- three daily chaplet that -PRON- soul may grow strong in each of the three theological virtue in faith in the father who have create -PRON- in hope in the son who have redeem -PRON- and in love of the holy ghost who have sanctify -PRON- and this thrice triple prayer -PRON- offer to the three person through mary in the name of -PRON- joyful and sorrowful and glorious mystery 
on each of the seven day of the week -PRON- further pray that one of the seven gift of the holy ghost may descend upon -PRON- soul and drive out of -PRON- day by day the seven deadly sin which have defile -PRON- in the past and -PRON- pray for each gift on -PRON- appoint day confident that -PRON- would descend upon -PRON- though -PRON- seem strange to -PRON- at time that wisdom and understanding and knowledge be so distinct in -PRON- nature that each should be pray for apart from the other 
yet -PRON- believe that at some future stage of -PRON- spiritual progress this difficulty would be remove when -PRON- sinful soul have be raise up from -PRON- weakness and enlighten by the third person of the most blessed trinity 
-PRON- believe this all the more and with trepidation because of the divine gloom and silence wherein dwell the unseen paraclete whose symbol be a dove and a mighty wind to sin against whom be a sin beyond forgiveness the eternal mysterious secret being to whom as god the priest offer up mass once a year robed in the scarlet of the tongue of fire 
the imagery through which the nature and kinship of the three person of the trinity be darkly shadow forth in the book of devotion which -PRON- readthe father contemplate from all eternity as in a mirror -PRON- divine perfection and thereby beget eternally the eternal son and the holy spirit proceed out of father and son from all eternitywere easy of acceptance by -PRON- mind by reason of -PRON- august incomprehensibility than be the simple fact that god have love -PRON- soul from all eternity for age before -PRON- have be bear into the world for age before the world -PRON- have exist 
-PRON- have hear the name of the passion of love and hate pronounce solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit have find -PRON- set forth solemnly in book and have wonder why -PRON- soul be unable to harbour -PRON- for any time or to force -PRON- lip to utter -PRON- name with conviction 
a brief anger have often invest -PRON- but -PRON- have never be able to make -PRON- an abide passion and have always feel -PRON- pass out of -PRON- as if -PRON- very body be be divest with ease of some outer skin or peel 
-PRON- have feel a subtle dark and murmurous presence penetrate -PRON- being and fire -PRON- with a brief iniquitous lust -PRON- too have slip beyond -PRON- grasp leave -PRON- mind lucid and indifferent 
this -PRON- seem be the only love and that the only hate -PRON- soul would harbour 
but -PRON- could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since god -PRON- have love -PRON- individual soul with divine love from all eternity 
gradually as -PRON- soul be enrich with spiritual knowledge -PRON- see the whole world form one vast symmetrical expression of power and love 
life become a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which be -PRON- even the sight of a single leaf hang on the twig of a tree -PRON- soul should praise and thank the giver 
the world for all -PRON- solid substance and complexity no longer exist for -PRON- soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality 
so entire and unquestionable be this sense of the divine meaning in all nature grant to -PRON- soul that -PRON- could scarcely understand why -PRON- be in any way necessary that -PRON- should continue to live 
yet that be part of the divine purpose and -PRON- dare not question -PRON- use -PRON- above all other who have sin so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose 
meek and abase by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent perfect reality -PRON- soul take up again -PRON- burden of piety masse and prayer and sacrament and mortification and only then for the first time since -PRON- have brood on the great mystery of love do -PRON- feel within -PRON- a warm movement like that of some newly bear life or virtue of the soul -PRON- 
the attitude of rapture in sacred art the raise and part hand the part lip and eye as of one about to swoon become for -PRON- an image of the soul in prayer humiliate and faint before -PRON- creator 
but -PRON- have be forewarn of the danger of spiritual exaltation and do not allow -PRON- to desist from even the least or lowly devotion strive also by constant mortification to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught with peril 
each of -PRON- sense be bring under a rigorous discipline 
in order to mortify the sense of sight -PRON- make -PRON- -PRON- rule to walk in the street with downcast eye glance neither to right nor leave and never behind -PRON- 
-PRON- eye shun every encounter with the eye of woman 
from time to time also -PRON- balk -PRON- by a sudden effort of the will as by lift -PRON- suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and close the book 
to mortify -PRON- hearing -PRON- exert no control over -PRON- voice which be then break neither sing nor whistle and make no attempt to flee from noise which cause -PRON- painful nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knife on the knifeboard the gathering of cinder on the fireshovel and the twigging of the carpet 
to mortify -PRON- smell be more difficult as -PRON- find in -PRON- no instinctive repugnance to bad odour whether -PRON- be the odour of the outdoor world such as those of dung or tar or the odour of -PRON- own person among which -PRON- have make many curious comparison and experiment 
-PRON- find in the end that the only odour against which -PRON- sense of smell revolt be a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstande urine and whenever -PRON- be possible -PRON- subject -PRON- to this unpleasant odour 
to mortify the taste -PRON- practise strict habit at table observe to the letter all the fast of the church and seek by distraction to divert -PRON- mind from the savour of different food 
but -PRON- be to the mortification of touch -PRON- bring the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness 
-PRON- never consciously change -PRON- position in bed sit in the most uncomfortable position suffer patiently every itch and pain keep away from the fire remain on -PRON- knee all through the mass except at the gospel leave part of -PRON- neck and face undried so that air may ste -PRON- and whenever -PRON- be not say -PRON- bead carry -PRON- arm stiffly at -PRON- side like a runner and never in -PRON- pocket or clasp behind -PRON- 
-PRON- have no temptation to sin mortally 
-PRON- surprise -PRON- however to find that at the end of -PRON- course of intricate piety and selfrestraint -PRON- be so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfection 
-PRON- prayer and fast avail -PRON- little for the suppression of anger at hear -PRON- mother sneeze or at be disturb in -PRON- devotion 
-PRON- need an immense effort of -PRON- will to master the impulse which urge -PRON- to give outlet to such irritation 
image of the outburst of trivial anger which -PRON- have often note among -PRON- master -PRON- twitch mouth closeshut lip and flushed cheek recur to -PRON- memory discourage -PRON- for all -PRON- practice of humility by the comparison 
to merge -PRON- life in the common tide of other life be hard for -PRON- than any fasting or prayer and -PRON- be -PRON- constant failure to do this to -PRON- own satisfaction which cause in -PRON- soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubt and scruple 
-PRON- soul traverse a period of desolation in which the sacrament -PRON- seem to have turn into dry up source 
-PRON- confession become a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfection 
-PRON- actual reception of the eucharist do not bring -PRON- the same dissolving moment of virginal selfsurrender as do those spiritual communion make by -PRON- sometimes at the close of some visit to the bless sacrament 
the book which -PRON- use for these visit be an old neglect book write by saint alphonsus liguori with fade character and sere foxpapere leave 
a faded world of fervent love and virginal response seem to be evoke for -PRON- soul by the reading of -PRON- page in which the imagery of the canticle be interweave with the communicant prayer 
an inaudible voice seem to caress the soul tell -PRON- name and glory bid -PRON- arise as for espousal and come away bid -PRON- look forth a spouse from amana and from the mountain of the leopard and the soul seem to answer with the same inaudible voice surrender -PRON- inter ubera mea commorabitur this idea of surrender have a perilous attraction for -PRON- mind now that -PRON- feel -PRON- soul beset once again by the insistent voice of the flesh which begin to murmur to -PRON- again during -PRON- prayer and meditation 
-PRON- give -PRON- an intense sense of power to know that -PRON- could by a single act of consent in a moment of thought undo all that -PRON- have do 
-PRON- seem to feel a flood slowly advance towards -PRON- naked foot and to be wait for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch -PRON- fevered skin 
then almost at the instant of that touch almost at the verge of sinful consent -PRON- find -PRON- stand far away from the flood upon a dry shore save by a sudden act of the will or a sudden ejaculation and see the silver line of the flood far away and begin again -PRON- slow advance towards -PRON- foot a new thrill of power and satisfaction shake -PRON- soul to know that -PRON- have not yield nor undo all 
when -PRON- have elude the flood of temptation many time in this way -PRON- grow troubled and wonder whether the grace which -PRON- have refuse to lose be not be filch from -PRON- little by little 
the clear certitude of -PRON- own immunity grow dim and to -PRON- succeed a vague fear that -PRON- soul have really fall unaware 
-PRON- be with difficulty that -PRON- win back -PRON- old consciousness of -PRON- state of grace by tell -PRON- that -PRON- have pray to god at every temptation and that the grace which -PRON- have pray for must have be give to -PRON- inasmuch as god be oblige to give -PRON- 
the very frequency and violence of temptation show -PRON- at last the truth of what -PRON- have hear about the trial of the saint 
frequent and violent temptation be a proof that the citadel of the soul have not fall and that the devil rage to make -PRON- fall 
often when -PRON- have confess -PRON- doubt and scruple some momentary inattention at prayer a movement of trivial anger in -PRON- soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act -PRON- be bid by -PRON- confessor to name some sin of -PRON- past life before absolution be give -PRON- 
-PRON- name -PRON- with humility and shame and repent of -PRON- once more 
-PRON- humiliate and shame -PRON- to think that -PRON- would never be free from -PRON- wholly however holily -PRON- may live or whatever virtue or perfection -PRON- may attain 
a restless feeling of guilt would always be present with -PRON- -PRON- would confess and repent and be absolve confess and repent again and be absolve again fruitlessly 
perhaps that first hasty confession wring from -PRON- by the fear of hell have not be good 
perhaps concern only for -PRON- imminent doom -PRON- have not have sincere sorrow for -PRON- sin 
but the sure sign that -PRON- confession have be good and that -PRON- have have sincere sorrow for -PRON- sin be -PRON- know the amendment of -PRON- life have amend -PRON- life have i not -PRON- ask -PRON- 
the director stand in the embrasure of the window -PRON- back to the light lean an elbow on the brown crossblind and as -PRON- speak and smile slowly dangle and loop the cord of the other blind stephen stand before -PRON- follow for a moment with -PRON- eye the waning of the long summer daylight above the roof or the slow deft movement of the priestly finger 
the priest face be in total shadow but the waning daylight from behind -PRON- touch the deeply grooved temple and the curve of the skull 
stephen follow also with -PRON- ear the accent and interval of the priest voice as -PRON- speak gravely and cordially of indifferent theme the vacation which have just end the college of the order abroad the transference of master 
the grave and cordial voice go on easily with -PRON- tale and in the pause stephen feel bind to set -PRON- on again with respectful question 
-PRON- know that the tale be a prelude and -PRON- mind wait for the sequel 
ever since the message of summon have come for -PRON- from the director -PRON- mind have struggle to find the meaning of the message and during the long restless time -PRON- have sit in the college parlour wait for the director to come in -PRON- eye have wander from one sober picture to another around the wall and -PRON- mind wander from one guess to another until the meaning of the summon have almost become clear 
then just as -PRON- be wish that some unforeseen cause may prevent the director from come -PRON- have hear the handle of the door turn and the swish of a soutane 
the director have begin to speak of the dominican and franciscan order and of the friendship between saint thomas and saint bonaventure 
the capuchin dress -PRON- think be rather too face give back the priest indulgent smile and not be anxious to give an opinion -PRON- make a slight dubitative movement with -PRON- lip believe continue the director that there be some talk now among the capuchin -PRON- of do away with -PRON- and follow the example of the other franciscan suppose -PRON- would retain -PRON- in the cloister say stephen certainly say the director 
for the cloister -PRON- be all right but for the street i really think -PRON- would be well to do away with -PRON- donot -PRON- 
-PRON- must be troublesome i imagine 
of course -PRON- be of course 
just imagine when i be in belgium i use to see -PRON- out cycle in all kind of weather with this thing up about -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be really ridiculous 
les jupe -PRON- call -PRON- in belgium 
the vowel be so modify as to be indistinct 
what do -PRON- call -PRON- 
les jupe 
stephen smile again in answer to the smile which -PRON- could not see on the priest shadow face -PRON- image or spectre only pass rapidly across -PRON- mind as the low discreet accent fall upon -PRON- ear 
-PRON- gaze calmly before -PRON- at the wane sky glad of the cool of the evening and of the faint yellow glow which hide the tiny flame kindle upon -PRON- cheek 
the name of article of dress wear by woman or of certain soft and delicate stuff use in -PRON- making bring always to -PRON- mind a delicate and sinful perfume 
as a boy -PRON- have imagine the rein by which horse be drive as slender silken band and -PRON- shock -PRON- to feel at stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness 
-PRON- have shock -PRON- too when -PRON- have feel for the first time beneath -PRON- tremulous finger the brittle texture of a woman stock for retain nothing of all -PRON- read save that which seem to -PRON- an echo or a prophecy of -PRON- own state -PRON- be only amid softworde phrase or within rosesoft stuff that -PRON- dare to conceive of the soul or body of a woman move with tender life 
but the phrase on the priest lip be disingenuous for -PRON- know that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme 
the phrase have be speak lightly with design and -PRON- feel that -PRON- face be be search by the eye in the shadow 
whatever -PRON- have hear or read of the craft of jesuit -PRON- have put aside frankly as not bear out by -PRON- own experience 
-PRON- master even when -PRON- have not attract -PRON- have seem to -PRON- always intelligent and serious priest athletic and highspirited prefect 
-PRON- think of -PRON- as man who wash -PRON- body briskly with cold water and wear clean cold linen 
during all the year -PRON- have live among -PRON- in clongowes and in belvedere -PRON- have receive only two pandie and though these have be deal -PRON- in the wrong -PRON- know that -PRON- have often escape punishment 
during all those year -PRON- have never hear from any of -PRON- master a flippant word -PRON- be -PRON- who have teach -PRON- christian doctrine and urge -PRON- to live a good life and when -PRON- have fall into grievous sin -PRON- be -PRON- who have lead -PRON- back to grace 
-PRON- presence have make -PRON- diffident of -PRON- when -PRON- be a muff in clongowes and -PRON- have make -PRON- diffident of -PRON- also while -PRON- have hold -PRON- equivocal position in belvedere 
a constant sense of this have remain with -PRON- up to the last year of -PRON- school life 
-PRON- have never once disobey or allow turbulent companion to seduce -PRON- from -PRON- habit of quiet obedience and even when -PRON- doubt some statement of a master -PRON- have never presume to doubt openly 
lately some of -PRON- judgement have sound a little childish in -PRON- ear and have make -PRON- feel a regret and pity as though -PRON- be slowly pass out of an accustomed world and be hear -PRON- language for the last time 
one day when some boy have gather round a priest under the shed near the chapel -PRON- have hear the priest say believe that lord macaulay be a man who probably never commit a mortal sin in -PRON- life that be to say a deliberate mortal sin 
some of the boy have then ask the priest if victor hugo be not the great french writer 
the priest have answer that victor hugo have never write half so well when -PRON- have turn against the church as -PRON- have write when -PRON- be a catholic 
but there be many eminent french critic say the priest who consider that even victor hugo great as -PRON- certainly be have not so pure a french style as louis veuillot 
the tiny flame which the priest allusion have kindle upon cheek have sink down again and -PRON- eye be still fix calmly on the colourless sky 
but an unresting doubt fly hither and thither before -PRON- mind 
masked memory pass quickly before -PRON- -PRON- recognise scene and person yet -PRON- be conscious that -PRON- have fail to perceive some vital circumstance in -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- walk about the ground watch the sport in clongowes and eat slim jim out of -PRON- cricketcap 
some jesuit be walk round the cycletrack in the company of lady 
the echo of certain expression use in clongowes sound in remote cave of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- ear be listen to these distant echo amid the silence of the parlour when -PRON- become aware that the priest be address -PRON- in a different voice send for -PRON- today stephen because i wish to speak to -PRON- on a very important subject 
yes sir 
have -PRON- ever feel that -PRON- have a vocation 
stephen part -PRON- lip to answer yes and then withhold the word suddenly 
the priest wait for the answer and add mean have -PRON- ever feel within -PRON- in -PRON- soul a desire to join the order 
think have sometimes think of -PRON- say stephen 
the priest let the blindcord fall to one side and unite -PRON- hand lean -PRON- chin gravely upon -PRON- commune with -PRON- 
in a college like this -PRON- say at length there be one boy or perhaps two or three boy whom god call to the religious life 
such a boy be mark off from -PRON- companion by -PRON- piety by the good example -PRON- show to other 
-PRON- be look up to by -PRON- -PRON- be choose perhaps as prefect by -PRON- fellow sodalist 
and -PRON- stephen have be such a boy in this college prefect of -PRON- blessed sodality 
perhaps -PRON- be the boy in this college whom god design to call to -PRON- 
a strong note of pride reinforce the gravity of the priest voice make heart quicken in response 
to receive that call stephen say the priest be the great honour that the almighty god can bestow upon a man 
no king or emperor on this earth have the power of the priest of god 
no angel or archangel in heaven no saint not even the bless virgin -PRON- have the power of a priest of god the power of the key the power to bind and to loose from sin the power of exorcism the power to cast out from the creature of god the evil spirit that have power over -PRON- the power the authority to make the great god of heaven come down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine 
what an awful power stephen 
a flame begin to flutter again on cheek as -PRON- hear in this proud address an echo of -PRON- own proud musing 
how often have -PRON- see -PRON- as a priest wield calmly and humbly the awful power of which angel and saint stand in reverence 
-PRON- soul have love to muse in secret on this desire 
-PRON- have see -PRON- a young and silentmannered priest enter a confessional swiftly ascend the altarstep incense genuflect accomplish the vague act of the priesthood which please -PRON- by reason of -PRON- semblance of reality and of -PRON- distance from -PRON- 
in that dim life which -PRON- have live through in -PRON- musing -PRON- have assume the voice and gesture which -PRON- have note with various priest 
-PRON- have bend -PRON- knee sideways like such a one -PRON- have shake the thurible only slightly like such a one -PRON- chasuble have swing open like that of such another as -PRON- turn to the altar again after have bless the people 
and above all -PRON- have please -PRON- to fill the second place in those dim scene of -PRON- imagining 
-PRON- shrink from the dignity of celebrant because -PRON- displease -PRON- to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in -PRON- own person or that the ritual should assign to -PRON- so clear and final an office 
-PRON- long for the minor sacred office to be vest with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass to stand aloof from the altar forget by the people -PRON- shoulder cover with a humeral veil hold the paten within -PRON- fold or when the sacrifice have be accomplish to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant -PRON- hand join and -PRON- face towards the people and sing the chant ite missa est if ever -PRON- have see -PRON- celebrant -PRON- be as in the picture of the mass in -PRON- child massbook in a church without worshipper save for the angel of the sacrifice at a bare altar and serve by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than -PRON- 
in vague sacrificial or sacramental act alone -PRON- will seem draw to go forth to encounter reality and -PRON- be partly the absence of an appoint rite which have always constrain -PRON- to inaction whether -PRON- have allow silence to cover -PRON- anger or pride or have suffer only an embrace -PRON- long to give 
-PRON- listen in reverent silence now to the priest appeal and through the word -PRON- hear even more distinctly a voice bid -PRON- approach offer -PRON- secret knowledge and secret power 
-PRON- would know then what be the sin of simon magus and what the sin against the holy ghost for which there be no forgiveness 
-PRON- would know obscure thing hide from other from those who be conceive and bear child of wrath 
-PRON- would know the sin the sinful longing and sinful thought and sinful act of other hear -PRON- murmur into -PRON- ear in the confessional under the shame of a darken chapel by the lip of woman and of girl but render immune mysteriously at -PRON- ordination by the imposition of hand -PRON- soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of the altar 
no touch of sin would linger upon the hand with which -PRON- would elevate and break the host no touch of sin would linger on -PRON- lip in prayer to make -PRON- eat and drink damnation to -PRON- not discern the body of the lord 
-PRON- would hold -PRON- secret knowledge and secret power be as sinless as the innocent and -PRON- would be a priest for ever accord to the order of melchisedec will offer up -PRON- mass tomorrow morning say the director that almighty god may reveal to -PRON- -PRON- holy will 
and let -PRON- stephen make a novena to -PRON- holy patron saint the first martyr who be very powerful with god that god may enlighten -PRON- mind 
but -PRON- must be quite sure stephen that -PRON- have a vocation because -PRON- would be terrible if -PRON- find afterwards that -PRON- have none 
once a priest always a priest remember 
-PRON- catechism tell -PRON- that the sacrament of holy order be one of those which can be receive only once because -PRON- imprint on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be efface 
-PRON- be before -PRON- must weigh well not after 
-PRON- be a solemn question stephen because on -PRON- may depend the salvation of -PRON- eternal soul 
but -PRON- will pray to god together 
-PRON- hold open the heavy hall door and give -PRON- hand as if already to a companion in the spiritual life 
stephen pass out on to the wide platform above the step and be conscious of the caress of mild evening air 
towards church a quartet of young man be stride along with link arm sway -PRON- head and step to the agile melody of -PRON- leader concertina 
the music pass in an instant as the first bar of sudden music always do over the fantastic fabric of -PRON- mind dissolve -PRON- painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolve the sandbuilt turret of child 
smile at the trivial air -PRON- raise -PRON- eye to the priest face and see in -PRON- a mirthless reflection of the sink day detach -PRON- hand slowly which have acquiesce faintly in that companionship 
as -PRON- descend the step the impression which efface -PRON- troubled selfcommunion be that of a mirthless mask reflect a sink day from the threshold of the college 
the shadow then of the life of the college pass gravely over -PRON- consciousness 
-PRON- be a grave and order and passionless life that await -PRON- a life without material care 
-PRON- wonder how -PRON- would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what dismay -PRON- would wake the first morning in the dormitory 
the troubling odour of the long corridor of clongowes come back to -PRON- and -PRON- hear the discreet murmur of the burn gasflame 
at once from every part of -PRON- be unrest begin to irradiate 
a feverish quickening of -PRON- pulse follow and a din of meaningless word drive -PRON- reason thought hither and thither confusedly 
-PRON- lung dilate and sink as if -PRON- be inhale a warm moist unsustaining air and -PRON- smell again the moist warm air which hang in the bath in clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water 
some instinct wake at these memory strong than education or piety quicken within -PRON- at every near approach to that life an instinct subtle and hostile and arm -PRON- against acquiescence 
the chill and order of the life repel -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- rise in the cold of the morning and filing down with the other to early mass and try vainly to struggle with -PRON- prayer against the fainting sickness of -PRON- stomach 
-PRON- see -PRON- sit at dinner with the community of a college 
what then have become of that deeproote shyness of -PRON- which have make -PRON- loth to eat or drink under a strange roof 
what have come of the pride of -PRON- spirit which have always make -PRON- conceive -PRON- as a being apart in every order 
the reverend stephen dedalus -PRON- name in that new life leap into character before -PRON- eye and to -PRON- there follow a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of a face 
the colour fade and become strong like a change glow of pallid brick red 
be -PRON- the raw reddish glow -PRON- have so often see on wintry morning on the shaven gill of the priest 
the face be eyeless and sourfavoure and devout shot with pink tinge of suffocated anger 
be -PRON- not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuit whom some of the boy call lantern jaw and other foxy campbell 
-PRON- be pass at that moment before the jesuit house in gardiner street and wonder vaguely which window would be -PRON- if -PRON- ever join the order 
then -PRON- wonder at the vagueness of -PRON- wonder at the remoteness of -PRON- own soul from what -PRON- have hitherto imagine -PRON- sanctuary at the frail hold which so many year of order and obedience have of -PRON- when once a definite and irrevocable act of -PRON- threaten to end for ever in time and in eternity -PRON- freedom 
the voice of the director urge upon -PRON- the proud claim of the church and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeat -PRON- idly in -PRON- memory 
-PRON- soul be not there to hear and greet -PRON- and -PRON- know now that the exhortation -PRON- have listen to have already fall into an idle formal tale 
-PRON- would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as priest 
-PRON- destiny be to be elusive of social or religious order 
the wisdom of the priest appeal do not touch -PRON- to the quick 
-PRON- be destine to learn -PRON- own wisdom apart from other or to learn the wisdom of other -PRON- wander among the snare of the world 
the snare of the world be -PRON- way of sin 
-PRON- would fall 
-PRON- have not yet fall but -PRON- would fall silently in an instant 
not to fall be too hard too hard and -PRON- feel the silent lapse of -PRON- soul as -PRON- would be at some instant to come fall fall but not yet fall still unfallen but about to fall 
-PRON- cross the bridge over the stream of the tolka and turn -PRON- eye coldly for an instant towards the faded blue shrine of the bless virgin which stand fowlwise on a pole in the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottage 
then bend to the left -PRON- follow the lane which lead up to -PRON- house 
the faint sour stink of rot cabbage come towards -PRON- from the kitchen garden on the rise ground above the river 
-PRON- smile to think that -PRON- be this disorder the misrule and confusion of -PRON- father house and the stagnation of vegetable life which be to win the day in -PRON- soul 
then a short laugh break from -PRON- lip as -PRON- think of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen garden behind -PRON- house whom -PRON- have nickname the man with the hat 
a second laugh take rise from the first after a pause break from -PRON- involuntarily as -PRON- think of how the man with the hat work consider in turn the four point of the sky and then regretfully plunge -PRON- spade in the earth 
-PRON- push open the latchless door of the porch and pass through the naked hallway into the kitchen 
a group of -PRON- brother and sister be sit round the table 
tea be nearly over and only the last of the second water tea remain in the bottom of the small glass jar and jampot which do service for teacup 
discard crust and lump of sugar bread turn brown by the tea which have be pour over -PRON- lie scatter on the table 
little well of tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle be stick through the pith of a ravage turnover 
the sad quiet greyblue glow of the die day come through the window and the open door cover over and allay quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in heart 
all that have be deny -PRON- have be freely give to -PRON- the eld but the quiet glow of evening show -PRON- in -PRON- face no sign of rancour 
-PRON- sit near -PRON- at the table and ask where -PRON- father and mother be 
one answer goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro 
still another removal 
a boy name fallon in belvedere have often ask -PRON- with a silly laugh why -PRON- move so often 
a frown of scorn darken quickly -PRON- forehead as -PRON- hear again the silly laugh of the questioner 
-PRON- ask why be -PRON- on the move again if -PRON- a fair question 
becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro usboro outboro 
the voice of -PRON- young brother from the farther side of the fireplace begin to sing the air oft in the stilly night 
one by one the other take up the air until a full choir of voice be singe 
-PRON- would sing so for hour melody after melody glee after glee till the last pale light die down on the horizon till the first dark nightcloud come forth and night fall 
-PRON- wait for some moment listen before -PRON- too take up the air with -PRON- 
-PRON- be listen with pain of spirit to the overtone of weariness behind -PRON- frail fresh innocent voice 
even before -PRON- set out on life journey -PRON- seem weary already of the way 
-PRON- hear the choir of voice in the kitchen echo and multiply through an endless reverberation of the choir of endless generation of child and hear in all the echo an echo also of the recur note of weariness and pain 
all seem weary of life even before enter upon -PRON- 
and -PRON- remember that newman have hear this note also in the broken line of virgil give utterance like the voice of nature -PRON- to that pain and weariness yet hope of well thing which have be the experience of -PRON- child in every time 
-PRON- could wait no longer 
from the door of publichouse to the gate of clontarf chapel from the gate of clontarf chapel to the door of publichouse and then back again to the chapel and then back again to the publichouse -PRON- have pace slowly at first plant -PRON- step scrupulously in the space of the patchwork of the footpath then time -PRON- fall to the fall of verse 
a full hour have pass since -PRON- father have go in with dan crosby the tutor to find out for -PRON- something about the university 
for a full hour -PRON- have pace up and down wait but -PRON- could wait no longer 
-PRON- set off abruptly for the bull walk rapidly lest -PRON- father shrill whistle may call -PRON- back and in a few moment -PRON- have round the curve at the police barrack and be safe 
yes -PRON- mother be hostile to the idea as -PRON- have read from -PRON- listless silence 
yet -PRON- mistrust prick -PRON- more keenly than -PRON- father pride and -PRON- think coldly how -PRON- have watch the faith which be fade down in -PRON- soul age and strengthen in -PRON- eye 
a dim antagonism gather force within -PRON- and darken -PRON- mind as a cloud against -PRON- disloyalty and when -PRON- pass cloudlike leave -PRON- mind serene and dutiful towards -PRON- again -PRON- be make aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of -PRON- life 
the university 
so -PRON- have pass beyond the challenge of the sentry who have stand as guardian of -PRON- boyhood and have seek to keep -PRON- among -PRON- that -PRON- may be subject to -PRON- and serve -PRON- end 
pride after satisfaction uplift -PRON- like long slow wave 
the end -PRON- have be bear to serve yet do not see have lead -PRON- to escape by an unseen path and now -PRON- beckon to -PRON- once more and a new adventure be about to be open to -PRON- 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- hear note of fitful music leap upwards a tone and downward a diminished fourth upwards a tone and downward a major third like triplebranche flame leap fitfully flame after flame out of a midnight wood 
-PRON- be an elfin prelude endless and formless and as -PRON- grow wilder and faster the flame leap out of time -PRON- seem to hear from under the bough and grass wild creature race -PRON- foot patter like rain upon the leave 
-PRON- foot pass in patter tumult over -PRON- mind the foot of hare and rabbit the foot of hart and hind and antelope until -PRON- hear -PRON- no more and remember only a proud cadence from newman whose foot be as the foot of hart and underneath the everlasting arm 
the pride of that dim image bring back to -PRON- mind the dignity of the office -PRON- have refuse 
all through -PRON- boyhood -PRON- have muse upon that which -PRON- have so often think to be -PRON- destiny and when the moment have come for -PRON- to obey the call -PRON- have turn aside obey a wayward instinct 
now time lie between the oil of ordination would never anoint -PRON- body 
-PRON- have refuse 
why 
-PRON- turn seaward from the road at dollymount and as -PRON- pass on to the thin wooden bridge -PRON- feel the plank shake with the tramp of heavily shod foot 
a squad of christian brother be on -PRON- way back from the bull and have begin to pass two by two across the bridge 
soon the whole bridge be tremble and resounding 
the uncouth face pass -PRON- two by two stain yellow or red or livid by the sea and as -PRON- strive to look at -PRON- with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rise to -PRON- own face 
angry with -PRON- -PRON- try to hide -PRON- face from -PRON- eye by gaze down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but -PRON- still see a reflection therein of -PRON- topheavy silk hat and humble tapelike collar and loosely hang clerical clothe 
brother hickey 
brother quaid 
brother brother keogh 
-PRON- piety would be like -PRON- name like -PRON- face like -PRON- clothe and -PRON- be idle for -PRON- to tell -PRON- that -PRON- humble and contrite heart -PRON- may be pay a far rich tribute of devotion than -PRON- have ever be a gift tenfold more acceptable than -PRON- elaborate adoration 
-PRON- be idle for -PRON- to move -PRON- to be generous towards -PRON- to tell -PRON- that if -PRON- ever come to -PRON- gate strip of -PRON- pride beat and in beggar weed that -PRON- would be generous towards -PRON- love -PRON- as -PRON- 
idle and embitter finally to argue against -PRON- own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bid -PRON- not to love -PRON- neighbour as -PRON- with the same amount and intensity of love but to love -PRON- as -PRON- with the same kind of love 
-PRON- draw forth a phrase from -PRON- treasure and speak -PRON- softly to -PRON- day of dappled seaborne cloud 
the phrase and the day and the scene harmonise in a chord 
word 
be -PRON- -PRON- colour 
-PRON- allow -PRON- to glow and fade hue after hue sunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchard azure of wave the greyfringed fleece of cloud 
no -PRON- be not -PRON- colour -PRON- be the poise and balance of the period -PRON- 
do -PRON- then love the rhythmic rise and fall of word well than -PRON- association of legend and colour 
or be -PRON- that be as weak of sight as -PRON- be shy of mind -PRON- draw less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloure and richly story than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotion mirror perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose 
-PRON- pass from the trembling bridge on to firm land again 
at that instant as -PRON- seem to -PRON- the air be chill and look askance towards the water -PRON- see a fly squall darken and crisp suddenly the tide 
a faint click at -PRON- heart a faint throb in -PRON- throat tell -PRON- once more of how -PRON- flesh dread the cold infrahuman odour of the sea yet -PRON- do not strike across the down on -PRON- left but hold straight on along the spine of rock that point against the river mouth 
a veiled sunlight light up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river be embaye 
in the distance along the course of the slowflowe liffey slender mast fleck the sky and more distant still the dim fabric of the city lie prone in haze 
like a scene on some vague arra old as man weariness the image of the seventh city of christendom be visible to -PRON- across the timeless air no old nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the day of the thingmote 
dishearten -PRON- raise -PRON- eye towards the slowdrifte cloud dapple and seaborne 
-PRON- be voyage across the desert of the sky a host of nomad on the march voyage high over ireland westward bound 
the europe -PRON- have come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongue and valleye and woodbegirt and citadelle and of entrenched and marshal race 
-PRON- hear a confused music within -PRON- as of memory and name which -PRON- be almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant then the music seem to recede to recede to recede and from each recede trail of nebulous music there fall always one longdrawn call note piercing like a star the dusk of silence

-PRON- start up nervously from the stoneblock for -PRON- could no longer quench the flame in -PRON- blood 
-PRON- feel -PRON- cheek aflame and -PRON- throat throb with song 
there be a lust of wander in -PRON- foot that burn to set out for the end of the earth

evening would deepen above the sea night fall upon the plain dawn glimmer before the wanderer and show -PRON- strange field and hill and face 
where 
-PRON- look northward towards howth 
the sea have fall below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater and already the tide be run out fast along the foreshore 
already one long oval bank of sand lie warm and dry amid the wavelet

there be a long rivulet in the strand and as -PRON- wade slowly up -PRON- course -PRON- wonder at the endless drift of seaweed 
emerald and black and russet and olive -PRON- move beneath the current swaying and turning 
the water of the rivulet be dark with endless drift and mirror the highdrifting cloud 
the cloud be drift above -PRON- silently and silently the seatangle be drift below -PRON- and the grey warm air be still and a new wild life be singe in -PRON- vein 
where be -PRON- boyhood now 
where be the soul that have hang back from -PRON- destiny to brood alone upon the shame of -PRON- wound and in -PRON- house of squalor and subterfuge to queen -PRON- in fade cerement and in wreath that wither at the touch 
or where be -PRON- 
-PRON- be alone 
-PRON- be unheede happy and near to the wild heart of life 
-PRON- be alone and young and wilful and wildhearte alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish water and the seaharv of shell and tangle and veil grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figure of child and girl and voice childish and girlish in the air 
a girl stand before -PRON- in midstream alone and still gaze out to sea 
-PRON- seem like one whom magic have change into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird 
-PRON- long slender bare leg be delicate as a crane and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed have fashion -PRON- as a sign upon the flesh

a wild angel have appear to -PRON- the angel of mortal youth and beauty an envoy from the fair court of life to throw open before -PRON- in an instant of ecstasy the gate of all the way of error and glory 
on and on and on and on 
-PRON- halt suddenly and hear -PRON- heart in the silence 
how far have -PRON- walk 
what hour be -PRON- 
there be no human figure near -PRON- nor any sound bear to -PRON- over the air 
but the tide be near the turn and already the day be on the wane 
-PRON- turn landward and run towards the shore and run up the slope beach reckless of the sharp shingle find a sandy nook amid a ring of tufte sandknoll and lie down there that the peace and silence of the evening may still the riot of -PRON- blood 
-PRON- feel above -PRON- the vast indifferent dome and the calm process of the heavenly body and the earth beneath -PRON- the earth that have bear -PRON- have take -PRON- to -PRON- breast 
-PRON- close -PRON- eye in the languor of sleep 
-PRON- eyelid tremble as if -PRON- feel the vast cyclic movement of the earth and -PRON- watcher tremble as if -PRON- feel the strange light of some new world 
-PRON- soul be swoon into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as under sea traverse by cloudy shape and being

evening have fall when -PRON- wake and the sand and arid grass of -PRON- bed glow no longer 
-PRON- rise slowly and recall the rapture of -PRON- sleep sigh at -PRON- joy 
-PRON- climb to the crest of the sandhill and gaze about -PRON-

well -PRON- a poor case -PRON- say when a university student be so dirty that -PRON- mother have to wash -PRON- 
but -PRON- give -PRON- pleasure say stephen calmly

-PRON- shake the sound out of -PRON- ear by an angry toss of -PRON- head and hurry on stumble through the moulder offal -PRON- heart already bite by an ache of loathing and bitterness 
-PRON- father whistle -PRON- mother muttering the screech of an unseen maniac be to -PRON- now so many voice offend and threaten to humble the pride of -PRON- youth 
-PRON- drive -PRON- echo even out of -PRON- heart with an execration but as -PRON- walk down the avenue and feel the grey morning light fall about -PRON- through the dripping tree and smell the strange wild smell of the wet leave and bark -PRON- soul be loose of -PRON- misery 
the rainladen tree of the avenue evoke in -PRON- as always memory of the girl and woman in the play of gerhart hauptmann and the memory of -PRON- pale sorrow and the fragrance fall from the wet branch mingle in a mood of quiet joy 
-PRON- morning walk across the city have begin and -PRON- foreknow that as -PRON- pass the slobland of fairview -PRON- would think of the cloistral silverveine prose of newman that as -PRON- walk along the north strand road glance idly at the window of the provision shop -PRON- would recall the dark humour of guido cavalcanti and smile that as -PRON- go by stonecutte work in talbot place the spirit of ibsen would blow through -PRON- like a keen wind a spirit of wayward boyish beauty and that pass a grimy marine dealer shop beyond the liffey -PRON- would repeat the song by ben jonson which begin i be not weary where i lie 
-PRON- mind when weary of -PRON- search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral word of aristotle or aquinas turn often for -PRON- pleasure to the dainty song of the elizabethan 
-PRON- mind in the vesture of a doubt monk stand often in shadow under the window of that age to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenist or the frank laughter of waistcoateer until a laugh too low a phrase tarnish by time of chambering and false honour sting -PRON- monkish pride and drive -PRON- on from -PRON- lurkingplace 
the lore which -PRON- be believe to pass -PRON- day brood upon so that -PRON- have rapt -PRON- from the companionship of youth be only a garner of slender sentence from poetic and psychology and a synopsis philosophi scholastic ad mentem divi thom 
-PRON- thinking be a dusk of doubt and selfmistrust light up at moment by the lightning of intuition but lightning of so clear a splendour that in those moment the world perish about -PRON- foot as if -PRON- have be fireconsume and thereafter -PRON- tongue grow heavy and -PRON- meet the eye of other with unanswere eye for -PRON- feel that the spirit of beauty have fold -PRON- round like a mantle and that in reverie at least -PRON- have be acquaint with nobility 
but when this brief pride of silence uphold -PRON- no longer -PRON- be glad to find -PRON- still in the midst of common life pass on -PRON- way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart 
near the hoarding on the canal -PRON- meet the consumptive man with the doll face and the brimless hat come towards -PRON- down the slope of the bridge with little step tightly button into -PRON- chocolate overcoat and hold -PRON- furl umbrella a span or two from -PRON- like a divine rod 
-PRON- must be eleven -PRON- think and peer into a dairy to see the time 
the clock in the dairy tell -PRON- that -PRON- be five minute to five but as -PRON- turn away -PRON- hear a clock somewhere near -PRON- but unseen beat eleven stroke in swift precision 
-PRON- laugh as -PRON- hear -PRON- for -PRON- make -PRON- think of and -PRON- see -PRON- a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breech and with a fair goatee stand in the wind at hopkin corner and hear -PRON- say dedalus -PRON- be an antisocial be wrap up in -PRON- not a democrat and work and act for social liberty and equality among all class and sex in the united state of the europe of the future 
eleven 
then -PRON- be late for that lecture too 
what day of the week be -PRON- 
-PRON- stop at a newsagent to read the headline of a placard 
thursday 
ten to eleven english eleven to twelve french twelve to one physics 
-PRON- fancy to -PRON- the english lecture and feel even at that distance restless and helpless 
-PRON- see the head of -PRON- classmate meekly bent as -PRON- write in -PRON- notebook the point -PRON- be bid to note nominal definition essential definition and example or date of birth or death chief work a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side 
-PRON- own head be unbent for -PRON- thought wander abroad and whether -PRON- look around the little class of student or out of the window across the desolate garden of the green an odour assail -PRON- of cheerless cellardamp and decay 
another head than -PRON- right before -PRON- in the first bench be poise squarely above -PRON- bend fellow like the head of a priest appeal without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshipper about -PRON- 
why be -PRON- that when -PRON- think of cranly -PRON- could never raise before -PRON- mind the entire image of -PRON- body but only the image of the head and face 
even now against the grey curtain of the morning -PRON- see -PRON- before -PRON- like the phantom of a dream the face of a sever head or death mask crown on the brow by -PRON- stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown 
-PRON- be a priestlike face priestlike in -PRON- pallor in the wide winged nose in the shadowing below the eye and along the jaws priestlike in the lip that be long and bloodless and faintly smile and stephen remember swiftly how -PRON- have tell cranly of all the tumult and unrest and longing in -PRON- soul day after day and night by night only to be answer by -PRON- friend listen silence would have tell -PRON- that -PRON- be the face of a guilty priest who hear confession of those whom -PRON- have not power to absolve but that -PRON- feel again in memory the gaze of -PRON- dark womanish eye 
through this image -PRON- have a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turn away from -PRON- feel that -PRON- be not yet the hour to enter -PRON- 
but the nightshade of -PRON- friend listlessness seem to be diffuse in the air around -PRON- a tenuous and deadly exhalation and -PRON- find -PRON- glance from one casual word to another on -PRON- right or leave in stolid wonder that -PRON- have be so silently empty of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bind -PRON- mind like the word of a spell and -PRON- soul shrivel up sigh with age as -PRON- walk on in a lane among heap of dead language 
-PRON- own consciousness of language be ebb from -PRON- brain and trickle into the very word -PRON- which set to band and disband -PRON- in wayward rhythm the ivy whine upon the wall and whine and twine upon the wall the yellow ivy upon the wall ivy ivy up the wall 
do anyone ever hear such drivel 
lord almighty 
who ever hear of ivy whine on a wall 
yellow ivy that be all right 
yellow ivory also 
and what about ivory ivy 
the word now shine in -PRON- brain clearer and bright than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusk of elephant 
ivory ivoire avorio ebur one of the first example that -PRON- have learn in latin have run india mittit ebur and -PRON- recall the shrewd northern face of the rector who have teach -PRON- to construe the metamorphosis of ovid in a courtly english make whimsical by the mention of porker and potsherd and chine of bacon 
-PRON- have learn what little -PRON- know of the law of latin verse from a ragged book write by a portuguese priest 
contrahit orator variant in carmine vate 
the crisis and victory and secession in roman history be hand on to -PRON- in the trite word in tanto discrimine and -PRON- have try to peer into the social life of the city of city through the word implere ollam denariorum which the rector have render sonorously as the filling of a pot with denarie 
the page of -PRON- timeworn horace never feel cold to the touch even when -PRON- own finger be cold -PRON- be human page and fifty year before -PRON- have be turn by the human finger of john duncan inverarity and by -PRON- brother william malcolm inverarity 
yes those be noble name on the dusky flyleaf and even for so poor a latinist as -PRON- the dusky verse be as fragrant as though -PRON- have lie all those year in myrtle and lavender and vervain but yet -PRON- wound -PRON- to think that -PRON- would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the world culture and that the monkish learning in term of which -PRON- be strive to forge out an esthetic philosophy be hold no high by the age -PRON- live in than the subtle and curious jargon of heraldry and falconry 
the grey block of trinity on -PRON- left set heavily in the citys ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring pull -PRON- mind downward and while -PRON- be strive this way and that to free -PRON- foot from the fetter of the reformed conscience -PRON- come upon the droll statue of the national poet of ireland 
-PRON- look at -PRON- without anger for though sloth of the body and of the soul creep over -PRON- like unseen vermin over the shuffle foot and up the fold of the cloak and around the servile head -PRON- seem humbly conscious of -PRON- indignity 
-PRON- be a firbolg in the borrow cloak of a milesian and -PRON- think of -PRON- friend davin the peasant student 
-PRON- be a jesting name between -PRON- but the young peasant bear with -PRON- lightly go on stevie i have a hard head -PRON- tell -PRON- 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will 
the homely version of -PRON- christian name on the lip of -PRON- friend have touch stephen pleasantly when first hear for -PRON- be as formal in speech with other as -PRON- be with -PRON- 
often as -PRON- sit in room in grantham street wonder at -PRON- friend wellmade boot that flank the wall pair by pair and repeat for -PRON- friend simple ear the verse and cadence of other which be the veil of -PRON- own longing and dejection the rude firbolg mind of -PRON- listener have draw -PRON- mind towards -PRON- and fling -PRON- back again draw -PRON- by a quiet inbreed courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old english speech or by the force of -PRON- delight in rude bodily skillfor davin have sit at the foot of michael cusack the swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eye the terror of soul of a starve irish village in which the curfew be still a nightly fear 
side by side with -PRON- memory of the deed of prowess of -PRON- uncle mat davin the athlete the young peasant worship the sorrowful legend of ireland 
the gossip of -PRON- fellowstudent which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost love to think of -PRON- as a young fenian 
-PRON- nurse have teach -PRON- irish and shape -PRON- rude imagination by the broken light of irish myth 
-PRON- stand towards the myth upon which no individual mind have ever draw out a line of beauty and to -PRON- unwieldy tale that divide -PRON- as -PRON- move down the cycle in the same attitude as towards the roman catholic religion the attitude of a dullwitte loyal serf 
whatsoever of thought or of feeling come to -PRON- from england or by way of english culture -PRON- mind stand armed against in obedience to a password and of the world that lie beyond england -PRON- know only the foreign legion of france in which -PRON- speak of serve 
couple this ambition with the young man humour stephen have often call -PRON- one of the tame geese and there be even a point of irritation in the name point against that very reluctance of speech and deed in -PRON- friend which seem so often to stand between mind eager of speculation and the hidden way of irish life 
one night the young peasant -PRON- spirit sting by the violent or luxurious language in which stephen escape from the cold silence of intellectual revolt have call up before mind a strange vision 
the two be walk slowly towards room through the dark narrow street of the poor jew thing happen to -PRON- stevie last autumn come on winter and i never tell -PRON- to a live soul and -PRON- be the first person now i ever tell -PRON- to 
i disremember if -PRON- be october or november 
-PRON- be october because -PRON- be before i come up here to join the matriculation class 
stephen have turn -PRON- smile eye towards -PRON- friend face flatter by -PRON- confidence and win over to sympathy by the speaker simple accent be away all that day from -PRON- own place over in buttevanti donot know if -PRON- know where that isat a hurling match between the own boy and the fearless thurle and by god stevie that be the hard fight 
-PRON- first cousin fonsy davin be strip to -PRON- buff that day mind cool for the limerick but -PRON- be up with the forward half the time and shout like mad 
i never will forget that day 
one of the croke make a woeful wipe at -PRON- one time with -PRON- caman and i declare to god -PRON- be within an aim ace of get -PRON- at the side of -PRON- temple 
oh honest to god if the crook of -PRON- catch -PRON- that time -PRON- be do for am glad -PRON- escape stephen have say with a laugh but surely that s not the strange thing that happen -PRON- 
well i suppose that doesnot interest -PRON- but leastway there be such noise after the match that i miss the train home and i couldnot get any kind of a yoke to give -PRON- a lift for as luck would have -PRON- there be a mass meeting that same day over in castletownroche and all the car in the country be there 
so there be nothing for -PRON- only to stay the night or to foot -PRON- out 
well i start to walk and on i go and -PRON- be come on night when i get into the ballyhoura hill that s well than ten mile from kilmallock and there s a long lonely road after that 
-PRON- wouldnot see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound 
-PRON- be pitch dark almost 
once or twice i stop by the way under a bush to redden -PRON- pipe and only for the dew be thick have stretch out there and sleep 
at last after a bend of the road i spy a little cottage with a light in the window 
i go up and knock at the door 
a voice ask who be there and i answer i be over at the match in buttevant and be walk back and that be thankful for a glass of water 
after a while a young woman open the door and bring -PRON- out a big mug of milk 
-PRON- be half undressed as if -PRON- be go to bed when i knock and -PRON- have -PRON- hair hang and i think by -PRON- figure and by something in the look of -PRON- eye that -PRON- must be carry a child 
-PRON- keep -PRON- in talk a long while at the door and i think -PRON- strange because -PRON- breast and -PRON- shoulder be bare 
-PRON- ask -PRON- be i tired and would i like to stop the night there 
-PRON- say -PRON- be all alone in the house and that -PRON- husband have go that morning to queenstown with -PRON- sister to see -PRON- off 
and all the time -PRON- be talk stevie -PRON- have -PRON- eye fix on -PRON- face and -PRON- stand so close to -PRON- i could hear -PRON- breathing 
when i hand -PRON- back the mug at last -PRON- take -PRON- hand to draw -PRON- in over the threshold and say come in and stay the night here no call to be frighten no one in -PRON- but i didnot go in stevie 
i thank -PRON- and go on -PRON- way again all in a fever 
at the first bend of the road i look back and -PRON- be stand at the door 
the last word of story sing in -PRON- memory and the figure of the woman in the story stand forth reflect in other figure of the peasant woman whom -PRON- have see stand in the doorway at clane as the college car drive by as a type of -PRON- race and of -PRON- own a batlike soul wake to the consciousness of -PRON- in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and through the eye and voice and gesture of a woman without guile call the stranger to -PRON- bed 
a hand be lay on -PRON- arm and a young voice cry ah gentleman -PRON- own girl sir 
the first handsel today gentleman 
buy that lovely bunch 
will -PRON- gentleman 
the blue flower which -PRON- lift towards -PRON- and -PRON- young blue eye seem to -PRON- at that instant image of guilelessness and -PRON- halt till the image have vanish and -PRON- see only -PRON- ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face 
do gentleman forget -PRON- own girl sir have no money say stephen 
buy -PRON- lovely one will -PRON- sir 
only a penny 
do -PRON- hear what i say ask stephen bend towards -PRON- 
i tell -PRON- i have no money 
i tell -PRON- again now 
well sure -PRON- will some day sir please god the girl answer after an instant 
possibly say stephen but i donot think -PRON- likely 
-PRON- leave -PRON- quickly fear that -PRON- intimacy may turn to gibe and wish to be out of the way before -PRON- offer -PRON- ware to another a tourist from england or a student of trinity 
grafton street along which -PRON- walk prolong that moment of discouraged poverty 
in the roadway at the head of the street a slab be set to the memory of wolfe tone and -PRON- remember have be present with -PRON- father at -PRON- laying 
-PRON- remember with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute 
there be four french delegate in a brake and one a plump smile young man hold wedge on a stick a card on which be print the word vive but the tree in green be fragrant of rain and the rainsodden earth give forth -PRON- mortal odour a faint incense rise upward through the mould from many heart 
the soul of the gallant venal city which -PRON- elder have tell -PRON- of have shrink with time to a faint mortal odour rise from the earth and -PRON- know that in a moment when -PRON- enter the sombre college -PRON- would be conscious of a corruption other than that of buck egan and burnchapel whaley 
-PRON- be too late to go upstairs to the french class 
-PRON- cross the hall and take the corridor to the left which lead to the physics theatre 
the corridor be dark and silent but not unwatchful 
why do -PRON- feel that -PRON- be not unwatchful 
be -PRON- because -PRON- have hear that in buck time there be a secret staircase there 
or be the jesuit house extraterritorial and be -PRON- walk among alien 
the ireland of tone and of parnell seem to have recede in space 
-PRON- open the door of the theatre and halt in the chilly grey light that struggle through the dusty window 
a figure be crouch before the large grate and by -PRON- leanness and greyness -PRON- know that -PRON- be the dean of study light the fire 
stephen close the door quietly and approach the fireplace 
good morning sir 
can i help -PRON- 
the priest look up quickly and say one moment now mr dedalus and -PRON- will see 
there be an art in light a fire 
-PRON- have the liberal art and -PRON- have the useful art 
this be one of the useful art will try to learn -PRON- say stephen 
not too much coal say the dean work briskly at -PRON- task that be one of the secret 
-PRON- produce four candlebutt from the sidepocket of -PRON- soutane and place -PRON- deftly among the coal and twisted paper 
stephen watch -PRON- in silence 
kneel thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busy with the disposition of -PRON- wisps of paper and candlebutt -PRON- seem more than ever a humble server make ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple a levite of the lord 
like a levite robe of plain linen the fade worn soutane drape the kneeling figure of one whom the canonical or the bellbordered ephod would irk and trouble 
-PRON- very body have wax old in lowly service of the tend the fire upon the altar in bear tiding secretly in wait upon worldling in strike swiftly when biddenand yet have remain ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty 
nay -PRON- very soul have wax old in that service without grow towards light and beauty or spread abroad a sweet odour of -PRON- sanctitya mortify will no more responsive to the thrill of -PRON- obedience than be to the thrill of love or combat -PRON- age body spare and sinewy grey with a silverpointe down 
the dean rest back on -PRON- hunker and watch the stick catch 
stephen to fill the silence say be sure i could not light a fire 
-PRON- be an artist be -PRON- not mr dedalus say the dean glance up and blink -PRON- pale eye 
the object of the artist be the creation of the beautiful 
what the beautiful be be another question 
-PRON- rub -PRON- hand slowly and drily over the difficulty 
can -PRON- solve that question now -PRON- ask 
aquinas answer stephen say pulcra sunt qu visa placent 
this fire before -PRON- say the dean will be pleasing to the eye 
will -PRON- therefore be beautiful 
in so far as -PRON- be apprehend by the sight which i suppose mean here esthetic intellection -PRON- will be beautiful 
but aquinas also say bonum est in quod tendit appetitus 
in so far as -PRON- satisfy the animal craving for warmth fire be a good 
in hell however -PRON- be an evil 
quite so say the dean -PRON- have certainly hit the nail on the head 
-PRON- rise nimbly and go towards the door set -PRON- ajar and say draught be say to be a help in these matter 
as -PRON- come back to the hearth limp slightly but with a brisk step stephen see the silent soul of a jesuit look out at -PRON- from the pale loveless eye 
like ignatius -PRON- be lame but in -PRON- eye burn no spark of ignatius enthusiasm 
even the legendary craft of the company a craft subtler and more secret than -PRON- fabled book of secret subtle wisdom have not fire -PRON- soul with the energy of apostleship 
-PRON- seem as if -PRON- use the shift and lore and cunning of the world as bidden to do for the great glory of god without joy in -PRON- handling or hatred of that in -PRON- which be evil but turn -PRON- with a firm gesture of obedience back upon -PRON- and for all this silent service -PRON- seem as if -PRON- love not at all the master and little if at all the end -PRON- serve 
similiter atque senis baculus -PRON- be as the founder would have have -PRON- like a staff in an old man hand to be lean on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather to lie with a ladys nosegay on a garden seat to be raise in menace 
the dean return to the hearth and begin to stroke -PRON- chin 
when may -PRON- expect to have something from -PRON- on the esthetic question -PRON- ask 
from -PRON- say stephen in astonishment 
i stumble on an idea once a fortnight if i be lucky 
these question be very profound mr dedalus say the dean 
-PRON- be like look down from the cliff of moher into the depth 
many go down into the depth and never come up 
only the train diver can go down into those depth and explore -PRON- and come to the surface again 
if -PRON- mean speculation sir say stephen i also be sure that there be no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bind by -PRON- own law 
ha 
for -PRON- purpose i can work on at present by the light of one or two idea of aristotle and aquina see 
i quite see -PRON- point need -PRON- only for -PRON- own use and guidance until i have do something for -PRON- by -PRON- light 
if the lamp smoke or smell i shall try to trim -PRON- 
if -PRON- do not give light enough i shall sell -PRON- and buy another 
epictetus also have a lamp say the dean which be sell for a fancy price after -PRON- death 
-PRON- be the lamp -PRON- write -PRON- philosophical dissertation by 
-PRON- know epictetus 
an old gentleman say stephen coarsely who say that the soul be very like a bucketful of water 
-PRON- tell -PRON- in -PRON- homely way the dean go on that -PRON- put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the god and that a thief steal the lamp 
what do the philosopher do 
-PRON- reflect that -PRON- be in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp 
a smell of molten tallow come up from the dean candle butt and fuse -PRON- in consciousness with the jingle of the word bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket 
the priest voice too have a hard jingle tone mind halt by instinct check by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priest face which seem like an unlit lamp or a reflector hang in a false focus 
what lie behind -PRON- or within -PRON- 
a dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud charge with intellection and capable of the gloom of god mean a different kind of lamp sir say stephen 
undoubtedly say the dean 
one difficulty say stephen in esthetic discussion be to know whether word be be use accord to the literary tradition or accord to the tradition of the marketplace 
i remember a sentence of in which -PRON- say of the blessed virgin that -PRON- be detain in the full company of the saint 
the use of the word in the marketplace be quite different hope i be not detain -PRON- not in the least say the dean politely 
no no say stephen smile i yes i see say the dean quickly i quite catch the point detain 
-PRON- thrust forward -PRON- under jaw and utter a dry short cough 
to return to the lamp -PRON- say the feeding of -PRON- be also a nice problem 
-PRON- must choose the pure oil and -PRON- must be careful when -PRON- pour -PRON- in not to overflow -PRON- not to pour in more than the funnel can hold 
what funnel ask stephen 
the funnel through which -PRON- pour the oil into -PRON- lamp 
that say stephen 
be that call a funnel 
be -PRON- not a tundish 
what be a tundish 
that 
the the funnel 
be that call a tundish in ireland ask the dean 
i never hear the word in -PRON- life 
-PRON- be call a tundish in low drumcondra say stephen laugh where -PRON- speak the good english tundish say the dean reflectively 
that be a most interesting word 
i must look that word up 
upon -PRON- word i must 
-PRON- courtesy of manner rang a little false and stephen look at the english convert with the same eye as the eld brother in the parable may have turn on the prodigal 
a humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversion a poor englishman in ireland -PRON- seem to have enter on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity have be all but give througha latecomer a tardy spirit 
from what have -PRON- set out 
perhaps -PRON- have be bear and breed among serious dissenter see salvation in jesus only and abhor the vain pomp of the establishment 
have -PRON- feel the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of -PRON- turbulent schism six principle man peculiar people seed and snake baptist supralapsarian dogmatist 
have -PRON- find the true church all of a sudden in wind up to the end like a reel of cotton some finespun line of reason upon insufflation on the imposition of hand or the procession of the holy ghost 
or have lord christ touch -PRON- and bid -PRON- follow like that disciple who have sit at the receipt of custom as -PRON- sit by the door of some zincroofe chapel yawning and tell over -PRON- church pence 
the dean repeat the word yet again 
tundish 
well now that be interesting 
the question -PRON- ask -PRON- a moment ago seem to -PRON- more interesting 
what be that beauty which the artist struggle to express from lump of earth say stephen coldly 
the little word seem to have turn a rapier point of -PRON- sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe 
-PRON- feel with a smart of dejection that the man to whom -PRON- be speak be a countryman of ben jonson 
-PRON- think the language in which -PRON- be speak be -PRON- before -PRON- be mine 
how different be the word home christ ale master on -PRON- lip and on mine 
i can not speak or write these word without unrest of spirit 
-PRON- language so familiar and so foreign will always be for -PRON- an acquire speech 
i have not make or accept -PRON- word 
-PRON- voice hold -PRON- at bay 
-PRON- soul fret in the shadow of -PRON- language 
and to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime the dean add to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty 
and to inquire what kind of beauty be proper to each of the various art 
these be some interesting point -PRON- may take up 
stephen dishearten suddenly by the dean firm dry tone be silent and through the silence a distant noise of many boot and confused voice come up the staircase 
in pursue these speculation say the dean conclusively there be however the danger of perishing of inanition 
first -PRON- must take -PRON- degree 
set that before -PRON- as -PRON- first aim 
then little by little -PRON- will see -PRON- way 
i mean in every sense -PRON- way in life and in thinking 
-PRON- may be uphill pedal at first 
take mr moonan 
-PRON- be a long time before -PRON- get to the top 
but -PRON- get there may not have -PRON- talent say stephen quietly 
-PRON- never know say the dean brightly 
-PRON- never can say what be in -PRON- 
i most certainly should not be despondent 
per aspera ad astra -PRON- leave the hearth quickly and go towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first art class 
lean against the fireplace stephen hear -PRON- greet briskly and impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank smile of the coarse student 
a desolate pity begin to fall like dew upon -PRON- easily embittered heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly loyola for this halfbrother of the clergy more venal than -PRON- in speech more steadfast of soul than -PRON- one whom -PRON- would never call -PRON- ghostly father and -PRON- think how this man and -PRON- companion have earn the name of worldling at the hand not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for have plead during all -PRON- history at the bar of justice for the soul of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent 
the entry of the professor be signal by a few round of kentish fire from the heavy boot of those student who sit on the high tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbe window 
the calling of the roll begin and the response to the name be give out in all tone until the name of peter byrne be reach 
here 
a deep bass note in response come from the upper tier follow by cough of protest along the other bench 
the professor pause in -PRON- reading and call the next name cranly 
no answer 
mr cranly 
a smile fly across face as -PRON- think of -PRON- friend study 
try leopardstown say a voice from the bench behind 
stephen glance up quickly but snoutish face outline on the grey light be impassive 
a formula be give out 
amid the rustling of the notebook stephen turn back again and say give -PRON- some paper for sake 
be -PRON- as bad as that ask moynihan with a broad grin 
-PRON- tear a sheet from -PRON- scribbler and pass -PRON- down whisper in case of necessity any layman or woman can do -PRON- 
the formula which -PRON- write obediently on the sheet of paper the coiling and uncoiling calculation of the professor the spectrelike symbol of force and velocity fascinate and jaded mind 
-PRON- have hear some say that the old professor be an atheist freemason the grey dull day 
-PRON- seem a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which soul of mathematician may wander project long slend fabric from plane to plane of ever rare and paler twilight radiate swift eddy to the last verge of a universe ever vaster farther and more impalpable 
so -PRON- must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal 
perhaps some of -PRON- gentleman may be familiar with the work of mr gilbert 
in one of -PRON- song -PRON- speak of the billiard sharp who be condemn to play on a cloth untrue with a twisted cue and elliptical billiard ball

the student salute temple fumble as before at the peak of -PRON- cap -PRON- walk forward in silence 
as -PRON- near the alley stephen could hear the thud of the player hand and the wet smack of the ball and voice cry out excitedly at each stroke 
the three student halt round the box on which davin sit to follow the game 
temple after a few moment sidle across to stephen and say excuse -PRON- i want to ask -PRON- do -PRON- believe that jean jacque rousseau be a sincere man 
stephen laugh outright 
cranly pick up the break stave of a cask from the grass at -PRON- foot turn swiftly and say sternly temple i declare to the live god if -PRON- say another word do -PRON- know to anybody on any subject kill -PRON- super spottum -PRON- be like -PRON- i fancy say stephen an emotional man

-PRON- phrase be greet by a strange laugh from a student who lounge against the wall -PRON- peaked cap down on -PRON- eye 
the laugh pitch in a high key and come from a so muscular frame seem like the whinny of an elephant 
the student body shake all over and to ease -PRON- mirth -PRON- rub both -PRON- hand delightedly over -PRON- groin 
lynch be awake say cranly 
lynch for answer straighten -PRON- and thrust forward -PRON- chest 
lynch put out -PRON- chest say stephen as a criticism of life 
lynch smote -PRON- sonorously on the chest and say who have anything to say about -PRON- girth 
cranly take -PRON- at the word and the two begin to tussle 
when -PRON- face have flush with the struggle -PRON- draw apart pant 
stephen bend down towards davin who intent on the game have pay no heed to the talk of the other

what with -PRON- name and -PRON- idea be -PRON- irish at all 
come with -PRON- now to the office of arm and i will show -PRON- the tree of -PRON- family say stephen 
then be one of -PRON- say davin 
why donot -PRON- learn irish 
why do -PRON- drop out of the league class after the first lesson 
-PRON- know one reason why answer stephen 
davin toss -PRON- head and laugh 
oh come now -PRON- say 
be -PRON- on account of that certain young lady and father moran 
but that s all in -PRON- own mind stevie 
-PRON- be only talk and laugh 
stephen pause and lay a friendly hand upon shoulder 
do -PRON- remember -PRON- say when -PRON- know each other first 
the first morning -PRON- meet -PRON- ask -PRON- to show -PRON- the way to the matriculation class put a very strong stress on the first syllable 
-PRON- remember 
then -PRON- use to address the jesuit as father -PRON- remember 
i ask -PRON- about -PRON- be -PRON- as innocent as -PRON- speech a simple person say davin 
-PRON- know that 
when -PRON- tell -PRON- that night in harcourt street those thing about -PRON- private life honest to god stevie i be not able to eat -PRON- dinner 
i be quite bad 
i be awake a long time that night 
why do -PRON- tell -PRON- those thing 
thank say stephen 
-PRON- mean i be a monster 
no say davin 
but i wish -PRON- have not tell -PRON- 
a tide begin to surge beneath the calm surface of friendliness 
this race and this country and this life produce -PRON- -PRON- say 
i shall express -PRON- as i be 
try to be one of -PRON- repeat davin 
in heart -PRON- be an irishman but -PRON- pride be too powerful 
-PRON- ancestor throw off -PRON- language and take another stephen say 
-PRON- allow a handful of foreigner to subject -PRON- 
do -PRON- fancy i be go to pay in -PRON- own life and person debt -PRON- make 
what for 
for -PRON- freedom say davin 
no honourable and sincere man say stephen have give up to -PRON- -PRON- life and -PRON- youth and -PRON- affection from the day of tone to those of parnell but -PRON- sell -PRON- to the enemy or fail -PRON- in need or revile -PRON- and leave -PRON- for another 
and -PRON- invite -PRON- to be one of -PRON- see -PRON- damn first 
-PRON- die for -PRON- ideal stevie say davin 
-PRON- day will come yet believe -PRON- 
stephen follow -PRON- own thought be silent for an instant 
the soul be bear -PRON- say vaguely first in those moment i tell -PRON- of 
-PRON- have a slow and dark birth more mysterious than the birth of the body 
when the soul of a man be bear in this country there be net fling at -PRON- to hold -PRON- back from flight 
-PRON- talk to -PRON- of nationality language religion 
i shall try to fly by those net 
davin knock the ashe from -PRON- pipe 
too deep for -PRON- stevie -PRON- say 
but a man country come first 
ireland first stevie 
-PRON- can be a poet or a mystic after 
do -PRON- know what ireland be ask stephen with cold violence 
ireland be the old sow that eat -PRON- farrow 
davin rise from -PRON- box and go towards the player shake -PRON- head sadly 
but in a moment -PRON- sadness leave -PRON- and -PRON- be hotly dispute with cranly and the two player who have finish -PRON- game 
a match of four be arrange cranly insist however that -PRON- ball should be use 
-PRON- let -PRON- rebound twice or thrice to -PRON- hand and strike -PRON- strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley exclaim in answer to -PRON- thud -PRON- soul 
stephen stand with lynch till the score begin to rise 
then -PRON- pluck -PRON- by the sleeve to come away 
lynch obey say let -PRON- eke go as cranly have -PRON- 
stephen smile at this sidethrust 
-PRON- pass back through the garden and out through the hall where the dodder porter be pin up a hall notice in the frame 
at the foot of the step -PRON- halt and stephen take a packet of cigarette from -PRON- pocket and offer -PRON- to -PRON- companion know -PRON- be poor -PRON- say 
damn -PRON- yellow insolence answer lynch 
this second proof of culture make stephen smile again 
-PRON- be a great day for european culture -PRON- say when -PRON- make up -PRON- mind to swear in yellow 
-PRON- light -PRON- cigarette and turn to the right 
after a pause stephen begin aristotle have not define pity and terror 
i have 
i say 
lynch halt and say bluntly stop 
i wonot listen 
i be sick 
i be out last night on a yellow drunk with horan and goggin 
stephen go on pity be the feeling which arrest the mind in the presence of whatsoever be grave and constant in human suffering and unite -PRON- with the human sufferer 
terror be the feeling which arrest the mind in the presence of whatsoever be grave and constant in human suffering and unite -PRON- with the secret cause 
repeat say lynch 
stephen repeat the definition slowly girl get into a hansom a few day ago -PRON- go on in london 
-PRON- be on -PRON- way to meet -PRON- mother whom -PRON- have not see for many year 
at the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shiver the window of the hansom in the shape of a star 
a long fine needle of the shiver glass pierce -PRON- heart 
-PRON- die on the instant 
the reporter call -PRON- a tragic death 
-PRON- be not 
-PRON- be remote from terror and pity accord to the term of -PRON- definition 
the tragic emotion in fact be a face look two way towards terror and towards pity both of which be phase of -PRON- 
-PRON- see i use the word arrest 
i mean that the tragic emotion be static 
or rather the dramatic emotion be 
the feeling excite by improper art be kinetic desire or loathing 
desire urge -PRON- to possess to go to something loathing urge -PRON- to abandon to go from something 
the art which excite -PRON- pornographical or didactic be therefore improper art 
the esthetic emotion use the general term be therefore static 
the mind be arrest and raise above desire and loathing 
-PRON- say that art must not excite desire say lynch 
i tell -PRON- that one day i write -PRON- name in pencil on the backside of the venus of praxitele in the museum 
be that not desire speak of normal nature say stephen 
-PRON- also tell -PRON- that when -PRON- be a boy in that charm carmelite school -PRON- eat piece of dry cowdung 
lynch break again into a whinny of laughter and again rub both -PRON- hand over -PRON- groin but without take -PRON- from -PRON- pocket 
i do 
i do -PRON- cry 
stephen turn towards -PRON- companion and look at -PRON- for a moment boldly in the eye 
lynch recover from -PRON- laughter answer -PRON- look from -PRON- humble eye 
the long slender flatten skull beneath the long pointed cap bring before mind the image of a hooded reptile 
the eye too be reptilelike in glint and gaze 
yet at that instant humble and alert in -PRON- look -PRON- be light by one tiny human point the window of a shrivelled soul poignant and selfembittere 
as for that stephen say in polite parenthesis -PRON- be all animal 
i also be an animal 
-PRON- be say lynch 
but -PRON- be just now in a mental world stephen continue 
the desire and loathing excite by improper esthetic mean be really not esthetic emotion not only because -PRON- be kinetic in character but also because -PRON- be not more than physical 
-PRON- flesh shrink from what -PRON- dread and respond to the stimulus of what -PRON- desire by a purely reflex action of the nervous system 
-PRON- eyelid close before -PRON- be aware that the fly be about to enter -PRON- eye 
not always say lynch critically 
in the same way say stephen -PRON- flesh respond to the stimulus of a naked statue but -PRON- be i say simply a reflex action of the nerve 
beauty express by the artist can not awaken in -PRON- an emotion which be kinetic or a sensation which be purely physical 
-PRON- awaken or ought to awaken or induce or ought to induce an esthetic stasis an ideal pity or an ideal terror a stasis call forth prolong and at last dissolve by what i call the rhythm of beauty 
what be that exactly ask lynch 
rhythm say stephen be the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to -PRON- part or part or of any part to the esthetic whole of which -PRON- be a part 
if that be rhythm say lynch let -PRON- hear what -PRON- call beauty and please remember though i do eat a cake of cowdung once that i admire only beauty 
stephen raise -PRON- cap as if in greeting 
then blush slightly -PRON- lay -PRON- hand on thick tweed sleeve 
-PRON- be right -PRON- say and the other be wrong 
to speak of these thing and to try to understand -PRON- nature and have understand -PRON- to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express to press out again from the gross earth or what -PRON- bring forth from sound and shape and colour which be the prison gate of -PRON- soul an image of the beauty -PRON- have come to understandthat be art -PRON- have reach the canal bridge and turn from -PRON- course go on by the tree 
a crude grey light mirror in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branch over -PRON- head seem to war against the course of thought 
but -PRON- have not answer -PRON- question say lynch 
what be art 
what be the beauty -PRON- express 
that be the first definition i give -PRON- -PRON- sleepyheade wretch say stephen when i begin to try to think out the matter for -PRON- 
do -PRON- remember the night 
cranly lose -PRON- temper and begin to talk about wicklow bacon remember say lynch 
-PRON- tell -PRON- about -PRON- flame fat devil of pig 
art say stephen be the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end 
-PRON- remember the pig and forget that 
-PRON- be a distress pair -PRON- and cranly 
lynch make a grimace at the raw grey sky and say if i be to listen to -PRON- esthetic philosophy give -PRON- at least another cigarette 
i donot care about -PRON- 
i donot even care about woman 
damn -PRON- and damn everything 
i want a job of five hundred a year 
-PRON- canot get -PRON- one 
stephen hand -PRON- the packet of cigarette 
lynch take the last one that remain say simply proceed 
aquinas say stephen say that be beautiful the apprehension of which please 
lynch nod remember that -PRON- say pulcra sunt qu visa placent -PRON- use the word visa say stephen to cover esthetic apprehension of all kind whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension 
this word though -PRON- be vague be clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing 
-PRON- mean certainly a stasis and not a kinesis 
how about the true 
-PRON- produce also a stasis of the mind 
-PRON- would not write -PRON- name in pencil across the hypothenuse of a rightangle triangle 
no say lynch give -PRON- the hypothenuse of the venus of praxitele 
static therefore say stephen 
plato i believe say that beauty be the splendour of truth 
i donot think that -PRON- have a meaning but the true and the beautiful be akin 
truth be behold by the intellect which be appease by the most satisfying relation of the intelligible beauty be behold by the imagination which be appease by the most satisfying relation of the sensible 
the first step in the direction of truth be to understand the frame and scope of the intellect -PRON- to comprehend the act -PRON- of intellection entire system of philosophy rest upon -PRON- book of psychology and that i think rest on -PRON- statement that the same attribute can not at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject 
the first step in the direction of beauty be to understand the frame and scope of the imagination to comprehend the act -PRON- of esthetic apprehension 
be that clear 
but what be beauty ask lynch impatiently 
out with another definition 
something -PRON- see and like 
be that the good -PRON- and aquinas can do 
let -PRON- take woman say stephen 
let -PRON- take -PRON- say lynch fervently 
the greek the turk the chinese the copt the hottentot say stephen all admire a different type of female beauty 
that seem to be a maze out of which -PRON- can not escape 
i see however two way out 
one be this hypothesis that every physical quality admire by man in woman be in direct connexion with the manifold function of woman for the propagation of the specie 
-PRON- may be so 
the world -PRON- seem be dreary than even -PRON- lynch imagine 
for -PRON- part i dislike that way out 
-PRON- lead to eugenic rather than to esthetic 
-PRON- lead -PRON- out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where with one hand on the origin of specie and the other hand on the new testament tell -PRON- that -PRON- admire the great flank of venus because -PRON- feel that -PRON- would bear -PRON- burly offspre and admire -PRON- great breast because -PRON- feel that -PRON- would give good milk to -PRON- child and your 
then be a sulphuryellow liar say lynch energetically 
there remain another way out say stephen laugh 
to wit say lynch 
this hypothesis stephen begin 
a long dray laden with old iron come round the corner of sir patrick hospital cover the end of speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattle metal 
lynch close -PRON- ear and give out oath after oath till the dray have pass 
then -PRON- turn on -PRON- heel rudely 
stephen turn also and wait for a few moment till -PRON- companion illhumour have have -PRON- vent 
this hypothesis stephen repeat be the other way out that though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people all people who admire a beautiful object find in -PRON- certain relation which satisfy and coincide with the stage -PRON- of all esthetic apprehension 
these relation of the sensible visible to -PRON- through one form and to -PRON- through another must be therefore the necessary quality of beauty 
now -PRON- can return to -PRON- old friend saint thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom 
lynch laugh 
-PRON- amuse -PRON- vastly -PRON- say to hear -PRON- quote -PRON- time after time like a jolly round friar 
be -PRON- laugh in -PRON- sleeve answer stephen would call -PRON- esthetic theory apply aquina 
so far as this side of esthetic philosophy extend aquina will carry -PRON- all along the line 
when -PRON- come to the phenomenon of artistic conception artistic gestation and artistic reproduction i require a new terminology and a new personal experience 
of course say lynch 
after all aquina in spite of -PRON- intellect be exactly a good round friar 
but -PRON- will tell -PRON- about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day 
hurry up and finish the first part 
who know say stephen smile 
perhaps aquina would understand -PRON- better than -PRON- 
-PRON- be a poet -PRON- 
-PRON- write a hymn for maundy thursday 
-PRON- begin with the word pange lingua gloriosi -PRON- say -PRON- be the high glory of the hymnal 
-PRON- be an intricate and soothing hymn 
i like -PRON- but there be no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song the vexilla regis of venantius fortunatus 
lynch begin to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice inpleta sunt qu concinit david fideli carmine dicendo nationibus regnavit a ligno deus great -PRON- say well pleased 
great music 
-PRON- turn into low mount street 
a few step from the corner a fat young man wear a silk neckcloth salute -PRON- and stop 
do -PRON- hear the result of the exam -PRON- ask 
griffin be pluck 
halpin and oflynn be through the home civil 
moonan get fifth place in the indian 
oshaughnessy get fourteenth 
the irish fellow in give -PRON- a feed last night 
-PRON- all eat curry 
-PRON- pallid bloated face express benevolent malice and as -PRON- have advance through -PRON- tiding of success -PRON- small fatencircled eye vanish out of sight and -PRON- weak wheezing voice out of hearing 
in reply to a question of -PRON- eye and -PRON- voice come forth again from -PRON- lurkingplace 
yes and -PRON- say take pure mathematic and take constitutional history 
there be twenty subject take botany too 
-PRON- know a member of the field club 
-PRON- draw back from the other two in a stately fashion and place a plump woollenglove hand on -PRON- breast from which mutter wheeze laughter at once break forth 
bring -PRON- a few turnip and onion the next time -PRON- go out say stephen drily to make a stew 
the fat student laugh indulgently and say -PRON- be all highly respectable people in the field club 
last saturday -PRON- go out to glenmalure seven of -PRON- 
with woman donovan say lynch 
donovan again lay -PRON- hand on -PRON- chest and say -PRON- end be the acquisition of knowledge 
then -PRON- say quickly hear -PRON- be write some essay about esthetic 
stephen make a vague gesture of denial 
goethe and lessing say donovan have write a lot on that subject the classical school and the romantic school and all that 
the laocoon interest -PRON- very much when i read -PRON- 
of course -PRON- be idealistic german ultraprofound 
neither of the other speak 
donovan take leave of -PRON- urbanely must go -PRON- say softly and benevolently i have a strong suspicion amount almost to a conviction that -PRON- sister intend to make pancake today for the dinner of the donovan family 
goodbye stephen say in -PRON- wake forget the turnip for -PRON- and -PRON- mate 
lynch gaze after -PRON- -PRON- lip curl in slow scorn till -PRON- face resemble a devil mask to think that that yellow pancakeeate excrement can get a good job -PRON- say at length and i have to smoke cheap cigarette 
-PRON- turn -PRON- face towards merrion square and go for a little in silence 
to finish what i be say about beauty say stephen the most satisfying relation of the sensible must therefore correspond to the necessary phase of artistic apprehension 
find these and -PRON- find the quality of universal beauty 
aquinas say ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur integrita consonantia clarita i translate -PRON- so three thing be need for beauty wholeness harmony and radiance do these correspond to the phase of apprehension 
be -PRON- follow 
of course i be say lynch 
if -PRON- think i have an excrementitious intelligence run after donovan and ask -PRON- to listen to -PRON- 
stephen point to a basket which a butcher boy have sling invert on -PRON- head 
look at that basket -PRON- say see -PRON- say lynch 
in order to see that basket say stephen -PRON- mind first of all separate the basket from the rest of the visible universe which be not the basket 
the first phase of apprehension be a bound line draw about the object to be apprehend 
an esthetic image be present to -PRON- either in space or in time 
what be audible be present in time what be visible be present in space 
but temporal or spatial the esthetic image be first luminously apprehend as selfbounde and selfcontaine upon the immeasurable background of space or time which be not -PRON- 
-PRON- apprehend -PRON- as one thing 
-PRON- see -PRON- as one whole 
-PRON- apprehend -PRON- wholeness 
that be integrita eye say lynch laugh 
go on 
then say stephen -PRON- pass from point to point lead by -PRON- formal line -PRON- apprehend -PRON- as balanced part against part within -PRON- limit -PRON- feel the rhythm of -PRON- structure 
in other word the synthesis of immediate perception be follow by the analysis of apprehension 
have first feel that -PRON- be one thing -PRON- feel now that -PRON- be a thing 
-PRON- apprehend -PRON- as complex multiple divisible separable make up of -PRON- part the result of -PRON- part and -PRON- sum harmonious 
that be consonantia eye again say lynch wittily 
tell -PRON- now what be clarita and -PRON- win the cigar 
the connotation of the word stephen say be rather vague 
aquinas use a term which seem to be inexact 
-PRON- baffle -PRON- for a long time 
-PRON- would lead -PRON- to believe that -PRON- have in mind symbolism or idealism the supreme quality of beauty be a light from some other world the idea of which the matter be but the shadow the reality of which -PRON- be but the symbol 
i think -PRON- may mean that clarita be the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one make -PRON- outshine -PRON- proper condition 
but that be literary talk 
i understand -PRON- so 
when -PRON- have apprehend that basket as one thing and have then analyse -PRON- accord to -PRON- form and apprehend -PRON- as a thing -PRON- make the only synthesis which be logically and esthetically permissible 
-PRON- see that -PRON- be that thing which -PRON- be and no other thing 
the radiance of which -PRON- speak in the scholastic quidditas the whatness of a thing 
this supreme quality be feel by the artist when the esthetic image be first conceive in -PRON- imagination 
the mind in that mysterious instant shelley liken beautifully to a fade coal 
the instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty the clear radiance of the esthetic image be apprehend luminously by the mind which have be arrest by -PRON- wholeness and fascinate by -PRON- harmony be the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the italian physiologist luigi galvani use a phrase almost as beautiful as call the enchantment of the heart 
stephen pause and though -PRON- companion do not speak feel that -PRON- word have call up around -PRON- a thoughtenchante silence 
what i have say -PRON- begin again refer to beauty in the wide sense of the word in the sense which the word have in the literary tradition 
in the marketplace -PRON- have another sense 
when -PRON- speak of beauty in the second sense of the term -PRON- judgement be influence in the first place by the art -PRON- and by the form of that art 
the image -PRON- be clear must be set between the mind or sense of the artist -PRON- and the mind or sense of other 
if -PRON- bear this in memory -PRON- will see that art necessarily divide -PRON- into three form progress from one to the next 
these form be the lyrical form the form wherein the artist present -PRON- image in immediate relation to -PRON- the epical form the form wherein -PRON- present -PRON- image in mediate relation to -PRON- and to other the dramatic form the form wherein -PRON- present -PRON- image in immediate relation to other 
that -PRON- tell -PRON- a few night ago say lynch and -PRON- begin the famous discussion have a book at home say stephen in which i have write down question which be more amusing than your be 
in find the answer to -PRON- i find the theory of esthetic which i be try to explain 
here be some question i set -PRON- be a chair finely make tragic or comic 
be the portrait of mona lisa good if i desire to see -PRON- 
be the bust of sir philip crampton lyrical epical or dramatic 
if not why not why not indeed say lynch laughing 
if a man hack in fury at a block of wood stephen continue make there an image of a cow be that image a work of art if not why not a lovely one say lynch laugh again 
that have the true scholastic stink 
lessing say stephen should not have take a group of statue to write of 
the art be inferior do not present the form i speak of distinguished clearly one from another 
even in literature the high and most spiritual art the form be often confused 
the lyrical form be in fact the simple verbal vesture of an instant of emotion a rhythmical cry such as age ago cheer on the man who pull at the oar or drag stone up a slope 
-PRON- who utter -PRON- be more conscious of the instant of emotion than of -PRON- as feel emotion 
the simple epical form be see emerge out of lyrical literature when the artist prolong and brood upon -PRON- as the centre of an epical event and this form progress till the centre of emotional gravity be equidistant from the artist -PRON- and from other 
the narrative be no longer purely personal 
the personality of the artist pass into the narration -PRON- flow round and round the person and the action like a vital sea 
this progress -PRON- will see easily in that old english ballad turpin hero which begin in the first person and end in the third person 
the dramatic form be reach when the vitality which have flow and eddy round each person fill every person with such vital force that -PRON- or -PRON- assume a proper and intangible esthetic life 
the personality of the artist at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative finally refine -PRON- out of existence impersonalize -PRON- so to speak 
the esthetic image in the dramatic form be life purify in and reprojecte from the human imagination 
the mystery of esthetic like that of material creation be accomplish 
the artist like the god of creation remain within or behind or beyond or above -PRON- handiwork invisible refine out of existence indifferent pare -PRON- fingernail 
try to refine -PRON- also out of existence say lynch 
a fine rain begin to fall from the high veiled sky and -PRON- turn into the duke lawn to reach the national library before the shower come 
what do -PRON- mean lynch ask surlily by prate about beauty and the imagination in this miserable godforsaken island 
no wonder the artist retire within or behind -PRON- handiwork after have perpetrate this country 
the rain fall faster 
when -PRON- pass through the passage beside kildare house -PRON- find many student shelter under the arcade of the library 
cranly lean against a pillar be pick -PRON- tooth with a sharpen match listen to some companion 
some girl stand near the entrance door 
lynch whisper to stephen -PRON- beloved be here 
stephen take -PRON- place silently on the step below the group of student heedless of the rain which fall fast turn -PRON- eye towards -PRON- from time to time 
-PRON- too stand silently among -PRON- companion 
-PRON- have no priest to flirt with -PRON- think with conscious bitterness remember how -PRON- have see -PRON- last 
lynch be right 
-PRON- mind empty of theory and courage lapse back into a listless peace 
-PRON- hear the student talk among -PRON- 
-PRON- speak of two friend who have pass the final medical examination of the chance of get place on ocean liner of poor and rich practice all a bubble 
an irish country practice be well 
hyne be two year in liverpool and -PRON- say the same 
a frightful hole -PRON- say -PRON- be 
nothing but midwifery case 
do -PRON- mean to say -PRON- be well to have a job here in the country than in a rich city like that 
i know a fellow 
hyne have no brain 
-PRON- get through by stew pure stew mind -PRON- plenty of money to be make in a big commercial city 
depend on the practice 
ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox simpliciter sanguinarius atrox in liverpoolio -PRON- voice reach -PRON- ear as if from a distance in interrupt pulsation 
-PRON- be prepare to go away with -PRON- companion 
the quick light shower have draw off tarry in cluster of diamond among the shrub of the quadrangle where an exhalation be breathe forth by the blacken earth 
-PRON- trim boot prattle as -PRON- stand on the step of the colonnade talk quietly and gaily glance at the cloud hold -PRON- umbrella at cunne angle against the few last raindrop close -PRON- again hold -PRON- skirt demurely 
and if -PRON- have judge -PRON- harshly 
if -PRON- life be a simple rosary of hour -PRON- life simple and strange as a birds life gay in the morning restless all day tired at sundown 
-PRON- heart simple and wilful as a birds heart 
towards dawn -PRON- awake what sweet music 
-PRON- soul be all dewy wet 
over -PRON- limb in sleep pale cool wave of light have pass 
-PRON- lie still as if -PRON- soul lie amid cool water conscious of faint sweet music 
-PRON- mind be wake slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge a morning inspiration 
a spirit fill -PRON- pure as the pure water sweet as dew move as music 
but how faintly -PRON- be inbreathe how passionlessly as if the seraphim -PRON- be breathe upon -PRON- 
-PRON- soul be wake slowly fear to awake wholly 
-PRON- be that windless hour of dawn when madness wake and strange plant open to the light and the moth fly forth silently 
an enchantment of the heart 
the night have be enchant 
in a dream or vision -PRON- have know the ecstasy of seraphic life 
be -PRON- an instant of enchantment only or long hour and year and age 
the instant of inspiration seem now to be reflect from all side at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of what have happen or of what may have happen 
the instant flash forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confuse form be veil softly -PRON- afterglow 
in the virgin womb of the imagination the word be make flesh 
gabriel the seraph have come to the virgin chamber 
an afterglow deepen within -PRON- spirit whence the white flame have pass deepening to a rose and ardent light 
that rise and ardent light be -PRON- strange wilful heart strange that no man have know or would know wilful from before the beginning of the world and lure by that ardent roselike glow the choir of the seraphim be fall from heaven 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way lure of the fall seraphim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
the verse pass from -PRON- mind to -PRON- lip and murmur -PRON- over -PRON- feel the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through -PRON- 
the roselike glow send forth -PRON- ray of rhyme way day blaze praise raise 
-PRON- ray burn up the world consume the heart of man and angel the ray from the rose that be -PRON- wilful heart 
-PRON- eye have set man heart ablaze and -PRON- have have -PRON- will of -PRON- 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
and then 
the rhythm die away cease begin again to move and beat 
and then 
smoke incense ascend from the altar of the world 
above the flame the smoke of praise go up from ocean rim to rim tell no more of enchanted day 
smoke go up from the whole earth from the vapoury ocean smoke of -PRON- praise 
the earth be like a swinge swaying censer a ball of incense an ellipsoidal ball 
the rhythm die out at once the cry of -PRON- heart be break 
-PRON- lip begin to murmur the first verse over and over then go on stumble through half verse stammer and baffle then stop 
the heart cry be break 
the veiled windless hour have pass and behind the pane of the naked window the morning light be gather 
a bell beat faintly very far away 
a bird twitter two bird three 
the bell and the bird cease and the dull white light spread -PRON- east and west cover the world cover the roselight in -PRON- heart 
fear to lose all -PRON- raise -PRON- suddenly on -PRON- elbow to look for paper and pencil 
there be neither on the table only the soup plate -PRON- have eat the rice from for supper and the candlestick with -PRON- tendril of tallow and -PRON- paper socket singe by the last flame 
-PRON- stretch -PRON- arm wearily towards the foot of the bed grope with -PRON- hand in the pocket of the coat that hang there 
-PRON- finger find a pencil and then a cigarette packet 
-PRON- lie back and tear open the packet place the last cigarette on the window ledge and begin to write out the stanza of the villanelle in small neat letter on the rough cardboard surface 
have write -PRON- out -PRON- lie back on the lumpy pillow murmur -PRON- again 
the lump of knot flock under -PRON- head remind -PRON- of the lump of knot horsehair in the sofa of -PRON- parlour on which -PRON- use to sit smile or serious ask -PRON- why -PRON- have come displeased with -PRON- and with -PRON- confound by the print of the sacred heart above the untenanted sideboard 
-PRON- see -PRON- approach -PRON- in a lull of the talk and beg -PRON- to sing one of -PRON- curious song 
then -PRON- see -PRON- sit at the old piano strike chord softly from -PRON- speckled key and singing amid the talk which have rise again in the room to -PRON- who lean beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the elizabethan a sad and sweet loth to depart the victory chant of agincourt the happy air of greensleeve 
while -PRON- sing and -PRON- listen or feign to listen -PRON- heart be at rest but when the quaint old song have end and -PRON- hear again the voice in the room -PRON- remember -PRON- own sarcasm the house where young man be call by -PRON- christian name a little too soon 
at certain instant -PRON- eye seem about to trust -PRON- but -PRON- have wait in vain 
-PRON- pass now dance lightly across -PRON- memory as -PRON- have be that night at the carnival ball -PRON- white dress a little lift a white spray nodding in -PRON- hair 
-PRON- dance lightly in the round 
-PRON- be dance towards -PRON- and as -PRON- come -PRON- eye be a little averted and a faint glow be on -PRON- cheek 
at the pause in the chain of hand -PRON- hand have lie in -PRON- an instant a soft merchandise 
-PRON- be a great stranger now 
yes 
i be bear to be a monk be afraid -PRON- be a heretic 
be -PRON- much afraid 
for answer -PRON- have dance away from -PRON- along the chain of hand dance lightly and discreetly give -PRON- to none 
the white spray nod to -PRON- dancing and when -PRON- be in shadow the glow be deep on -PRON- cheek 
a monk 
-PRON- own image start forth a profaner of the cloister a heretic franciscan willing and willing not to serve spin like gherardino da borgo san donnino a lithe web of sophistry and whisper in -PRON- ear 
no -PRON- be not -PRON- image 
-PRON- be like the image of the young priest in whose company -PRON- have see -PRON- last look at -PRON- out of dove eye toy with the page of -PRON- irish phrasebook 
yes yes the lady be come round to -PRON- 
i can see -PRON- every day 
the lady be with -PRON- 
the good helper the language have 
and the church father moran 
the church too 
come round too 
the work be go ahead there too fret about the church 
bah -PRON- have do well to leave the room in disdain 
-PRON- have do well not to salute -PRON- on the step of the library 
-PRON- have do well to leave -PRON- to flirt with -PRON- priest to toy with a church which be the scullerymaid of christendom 
rude brutal anger route the last linger instant of ecstasy from -PRON- soul 
-PRON- break up violently -PRON- fair image and fling the fragment on all side 
on all side distort reflection of -PRON- image start from -PRON- memory the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden face who have call -PRON- -PRON- own girl and beg -PRON- handsel the kitchengirl in the next house who sing over the clatter of -PRON- plate with the drawl of a country singer the first bar of by lake and fell a girl who have laugh gaily to see -PRON- stumble when the iron grate in the footpath near cork hill have catch the break sole of -PRON- shoe a girl -PRON- have glance at attract by -PRON- small ripe mouth as -PRON- pass out of biscuit factory who have cry to -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder do -PRON- like what -PRON- see of -PRON- straight hair and curly eyebrow 
and yet -PRON- feel that however -PRON- may revile and mock -PRON- image -PRON- anger be also a form of homage 
-PRON- have leave the classroom in disdain that be not wholly sincere feeling that perhaps the secret of -PRON- race lie behind those dark eye upon which -PRON- long lash fling a quick shadow 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- bitterly as -PRON- walk through the street that -PRON- be a figure of the womanhood of -PRON- country a batlike soul wake to the consciousness of -PRON- in darkness and secrecy and loneliness tarry awhile loveless and sinless with -PRON- mild lover and leave -PRON- to whisper of innocent transgression in the latticed ear of a priest 
-PRON- anger against -PRON- find vent in coarse rail at -PRON- paramour whose name and voice and feature offend -PRON- baffle pride a priested peasant with a brother a policeman in dublin and a brother a potboy in moycullen 
to -PRON- -PRON- would unveil -PRON- soul shy nakedness to one who be but school in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to -PRON- a priest of the eternal imagination transmute the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everlive life 
the radiant image of the eucharist unite again in an instant -PRON- bitter and despair thought -PRON- cry arise unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving 
-PRON- broken cry and mournful lay rise in one eucharistic hymn be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
while sacrifice hand upraise the chalice flow to the brim tell no more of enchanted day 
-PRON- speak the verse aloud from the first line till the music and rhythm suffuse -PRON- mind turn -PRON- to quiet indulgence then copy -PRON- painfully to feel -PRON- the well by see -PRON- then lie back on -PRON- bolster 
the full morning light have come 
no sound be to be hear but -PRON- know that all around -PRON- life be about to awaken in common noise hoarse voice sleepy prayer 
shrink from that life -PRON- turn towards the wall make a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flower of the tattered wallpaper 
-PRON- try to warm -PRON- perishing joy in -PRON- scarlet glow imagine a roseway from where -PRON- lie upwards to heaven all strew with scarlet flower 
weary 
weary 
-PRON- too be weary of ardent way 
a gradual warmth a languorous weariness pass over -PRON- descend along -PRON- spine from -PRON- closely cowl head 
-PRON- feel -PRON- descend and see -PRON- as -PRON- lie smile 
soon -PRON- would sleep 
-PRON- have write verse for -PRON- again after ten year 
ten year before -PRON- have wear -PRON- shawl cowlwise about -PRON- head send spray of -PRON- warm breath into the night air tap -PRON- foot upon the glassy road 
-PRON- be the last tram the lank brown horse know -PRON- and shake -PRON- bell to the clear night in admonition 
the conductor talk with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp 
-PRON- stand on the step of the tram -PRON- on the upper -PRON- on the low 
-PRON- come up to -PRON- step many time between -PRON- phrase and go down again and once or twice remain beside -PRON- forget to go down and then go down 
let be 
let be 
ten year from that wisdom of child to -PRON- folly 
if -PRON- send -PRON- the verse 
-PRON- would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of eggshell 
folly indeed 
-PRON- brother would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with -PRON- strong hard finger 
the suave priest -PRON- uncle seat in -PRON- armchair would hold the page at arm length read -PRON- smile and approve of the literary form 
no no that be folly 
even if -PRON- send -PRON- the verse -PRON- would not show -PRON- to other 
no no -PRON- could not 
-PRON- begin to feel that -PRON- have wrong -PRON- 
a sense of -PRON- innocence move -PRON- almost to pity -PRON- an innocence -PRON- have never understand till -PRON- have come to the knowledge of -PRON- through sin an innocence which -PRON- too have not understand while -PRON- be innocent or before the strange humiliation of -PRON- nature have first come upon -PRON- 
then first -PRON- soul have begin to live as -PRON- soul have when -PRON- have first sin and a tender compassion fill -PRON- heart as -PRON- remember -PRON- frail pallor and -PRON- eye humble and sadden by the dark shame of womanhood 
while -PRON- soul have pass from ecstasy to languor where have -PRON- be 
may -PRON- be in the mysterious way of spiritual life that -PRON- soul at those same moment have be conscious of -PRON- homage 
-PRON- may be 
a glow of desire kindle again -PRON- soul and fire and fulfil all -PRON- body 
conscious of -PRON- desire -PRON- be wake from odorous sleep the temptress of -PRON- villanelle 
-PRON- eye dark and with a look of languor be open to -PRON- eye 
-PRON- nakedness yield to -PRON- radiant warm odorous and lavishlimbed enfold -PRON- like a shine cloud enfold -PRON- like water with a liquid life and like a cloud of vapour or like water circumfluent in space the liquid letter of speech symbol of the element of mystery flow forth over -PRON- brain 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way lure of the fall seraphim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
-PRON- eye have set man heart ablaze and -PRON- have have -PRON- will of -PRON- 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
above the flame the smoke of praise go up from ocean rim to rim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
-PRON- broken cry and mournful lay rise in one eucharistic hymn 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
while sacrifice hand upraise the chalice flow to the brim 
tell no more of enchanted day 
and still -PRON- hold -PRON- longing gaze with languorous look and lavish limb 
be -PRON- not weary of ardent way 
tell no more of enchanted day 
what bird be -PRON- 
-PRON- stand on the step of the library to look at -PRON- lean wearily on -PRON- ashplant 
-PRON- fly round and round the jut shoulder of a house in molesworth street 
the air of the late march evening make clear -PRON- flight -PRON- dark darting quivering body fly clearly against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue 
-PRON- watch -PRON- flight bird after bird a dark flash a swerve a flutter of wing 
-PRON- try to count -PRON- before all -PRON- dart quivering body pass six ten eleven and wonder be -PRON- odd or even in number 
twelve thirteen for two come wheel down from the upper sky 
-PRON- be fly high and low but ever round and round in straight and curve line and ever fly from leave to right circle about a temple of air 
-PRON- listen to the cry like the squeak of mouse behind the wainscot a shrill twofold note 
but the note be long and shrill and whir unlike the cry of vermin fall a third or a fourth and trill as the fly beak clove the air 
-PRON- cry be shrill and clear and fine and fall like thread of silken light unwound from whir spools 
the inhuman clamour soothe -PRON- ear in which -PRON- mother sob and reproach murmur insistently and the dark frail quiver body wheel and fluttering and swerve round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothe -PRON- eye which still see the image of -PRON- mother face 
why be -PRON- gaze upwards from the step of the porch hear -PRON- shrill twofold cry watch -PRON- flight 
for an augury of good or evil

what be -PRON- 
cranly ask after a pause 
stephen begin to enumerate glibly -PRON- father attribute medical student an oarsman a tenor an amateur actor a shouting politician a small landlord a small investor a drinker a good fellow a storyteller somebodys secretary something in a distillery a taxgatherer a bankrupt and at present a praiser of -PRON- own past 
cranly laugh tighten -PRON- grip on arm and say the distillery be damn good 
be there anything else -PRON- want to know 
stephen ask 
be -PRON- in good circumstance at present 
do i look -PRON- 
stephen ask bluntly 
so then cranly go on musingly -PRON- be bear in the lap of luxury 
-PRON- use the phrase broadly and loudly as -PRON- often use technical expression as if -PRON- wish -PRON- hearer to understand that -PRON- be use by -PRON- without conviction 
-PRON- mother must have go through a good deal of suffering -PRON- say then 
would -PRON- not try to save -PRON- from suffer more even if or would -PRON- 
if i could stephen say that would cost -PRON- very little 
then do so cranly say 
do as -PRON- wish -PRON- to do 
what be -PRON- for -PRON- 
-PRON- disbelieve in -PRON- 
-PRON- be a form nothing else 
and -PRON- will set -PRON- mind at rest 
-PRON- cease and as stephen do not reply remain silent 
then as if give utterance to the process of -PRON- own thought -PRON- say whatever else be unsure in this stink dunghill of a world a mother love be not 
-PRON- mother bring -PRON- into the world carry -PRON- first in -PRON- body 
what do -PRON- know about what -PRON- feel 
but whatever -PRON- feel -PRON- at least must be real 
-PRON- must be 
what be -PRON- idea or ambition 
play 
idea 
why that bloody bleat goat temple have idea have idea too 
every jackass go the road think -PRON- have idea 
stephen who have be listen to the unspoken speech behind the word say with assumed carelessness pascal if i remember rightly would not suffer -PRON- mother to kiss -PRON- as -PRON- fear the contact of -PRON- sex 
pascal be a pig say cranly 
aloysius gonzaga i think be of the same mind stephen say 
and -PRON- be another pig then say cranly 
the church call -PRON- a saint stephen object donot care a flame damn what anyone call -PRON- cranly say rudely and flatly 
i call -PRON- a pig 
stephen prepare the word neatly in -PRON- mind continue jesus too seem to have treat -PRON- mother with scant courtesy in public but suarez a jesuit theologian and spanish gentleman have apologise for -PRON- 
do the idea ever occur to -PRON- cranly ask that jesus be not what -PRON- pretend to be 
the first person to whom that idea occur stephen answer be jesus -PRON- mean cranly say harden in -PRON- speech do the idea ever occur to -PRON- that -PRON- be -PRON- a conscious hypocrite what -PRON- call the jew of -PRON- time a white sepulchre 
or to put -PRON- more plainly that -PRON- be a blackguard 
that idea never occur to -PRON- stephen answer 
but i be curious to know be -PRON- try to make a convert of -PRON- or a pervert of -PRON- 
-PRON- turn towards -PRON- friend face and see there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant 
cranly ask suddenly in a plain sensible tone tell -PRON- the truth 
be -PRON- at all shock by what i say 
somewhat stephen say 
and why be -PRON- shock cranly press on in the same tone if -PRON- feel sure that -PRON- religion be false and that jesus be not the son of god be not at all sure of -PRON- stephen say 
-PRON- be more like a son of god than a son of mary 
and be that why -PRON- will not communicate cranly ask because -PRON- be not sure of that too because -PRON- feel that the host too may be the body and blood of the son of god and not a wafer of bread 
and because -PRON- fear that -PRON- may be 
yes stephen say quietly i feel that and i also fear -PRON- see cranly say 
stephen strike by -PRON- tone of closure reopen the discussion at once by say fear many thing dog horse firearm the sea thunderstorm machinery the country road at night 
but why do -PRON- fear a bit of bread imagine stephen say that there be a malevolent reality behind those thing i say i fear 
do -PRON- fear then cranly ask that the god of the roman catholic would strike -PRON- dead and damn -PRON- if -PRON- make a sacrilegious communion 
the god of the roman catholic could do that now stephen say 
i fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in -PRON- soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which be mass twenty century of authority and veneration 
would -PRON- cranly ask in extreme danger commit that particular sacrilege 
for instance if -PRON- live in the penal day can not answer for the past stephen reply 
possibly not 
then say cranly -PRON- do not intend to become a protestant say that i have lose the faith stephen answer but not that i have lose selfrespect 
what kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which be logical and coherent and to embrace one which be illogical and incoherent 
-PRON- have walk on towards the township of pembroke and now as -PRON- go on slowly along the avenue the tree and the scatter light in the villa soothe -PRON- mind 
the air of wealth and repose diffuse about -PRON- seem to comfort -PRON- neediness 
behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmer in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant be hear singing as -PRON- sharpen knife 
-PRON- sing in short broken bar rosie cranly stop to listen say mulier cantat the soft beauty of the latin word touch with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman hand 
the strife of -PRON- mind be quell 
the figure of a woman as -PRON- appear in the liturgy of the church pass silently through the darkness a whiterobe figure small and slender as a boy and with a fall girdle 
-PRON- voice frail and high as a boy be hear intone from a distant choir the first word of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion et tu cum jesu galilo era and all heart be touch and turn to -PRON- voice shine like a young star shine clear as the voice intone the proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence die 
the singing cease 
-PRON- go on together cranly repeat in strongly stress rhythm the end of the refrain and when -PRON- be marry how happy well be for i love sweet rosie ogrady and rosie ogrady love -PRON- real poetry for -PRON- -PRON- say real love 
-PRON- glance sideways at stephen with a strange smile and say do -PRON- consider that poetry 
or do -PRON- know what the word mean want to see rosie first say stephen easy to find cranly say 
-PRON- hat have come down on -PRON- forehead 
-PRON- shove -PRON- back and in the shadow of the tree stephen see -PRON- pale face frame by the dark and -PRON- large dark eye 
yes 
-PRON- face be handsome and -PRON- body be strong and hard 
-PRON- have speak of a mother love 
-PRON- feel then the suffering of woman the weakness of -PRON- body and soul and would shield -PRON- with a strong and resolute arm and bow -PRON- mind to -PRON- 
away then -PRON- be time to go 
a voice speak softly to lonely heart bid -PRON- go and tell -PRON- that -PRON- friendship be come to an end 
yes -PRON- would go 
-PRON- could not strive against another 
-PRON- know -PRON- part 
probably i shall go away -PRON- say 
where 
cranly ask 
where i can stephen say 
yes cranly say 
-PRON- may be difficult for -PRON- to live here now 
but be -PRON- that make -PRON- go have to go stephen answer 
because cranly continue -PRON- need not look upon -PRON- as drive away if -PRON- do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw 
there be many good believer who think as -PRON- do 
would that surprise -PRON- 
the church be not the stone building nor even the clergy and -PRON- dogma 
-PRON- be the whole mass of those bear into -PRON- 
i donot know what -PRON- wish to do in life 
be -PRON- what -PRON- tell -PRON- the night -PRON- be stand outside harcourt street station 
yes stephen say smile in spite of -PRON- at way of remember thought in connexion with place 
the night -PRON- spend half an hour wrangle with doherty about the short way from sallygap to larra 
pothead 
cranly say with calm contempt 
what do -PRON- know about the way from sallygap to larra 
or what do -PRON- know about anything for that matter 
and the big slobbering washingpot head of -PRON- 
-PRON- break into a loud long laugh 
well 
stephen say 
do -PRON- remember the rest 
what -PRON- say be -PRON- 
cranly ask 
yes i remember -PRON- 
to discover the mode of life or of art whereby -PRON- spirit could express -PRON- in unfettered freedom 
stephen raise -PRON- hat in acknowledgement 
freedom 
cranly repeat 
but -PRON- be not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege 
tell -PRON- would -PRON- rob would beg first stephen say 
and if -PRON- get nothing would -PRON- rob 
-PRON- wish -PRON- to say stephen answer that the right of property be provisional and that in certain circumstance -PRON- be not unlawful to rob 
everyone would act in that belief 
so i will not make -PRON- that answer 
apply to the jesuit theologian juan mariana de talavera who will also explain to -PRON- in what circumstance -PRON- may lawfully kill -PRON- king and whether -PRON- have well hand -PRON- -PRON- poison in a goblet or smear -PRON- for -PRON- upon -PRON- robe or -PRON- saddlebow 
ask -PRON- rather would i suffer other to rob -PRON- or if -PRON- do would i call down upon -PRON- what i believe be call the chastisement of the secular arm 
and would -PRON- think stephen say -PRON- would pain -PRON- as much to do so as to be rob see cranly say 
-PRON- produce -PRON- match and begin to clean the crevice between two tooth 
then -PRON- say carelessly tell -PRON- for example would -PRON- deflower a virgin 
excuse -PRON- stephen say politely be that not the ambition of most young gentleman 
what then be -PRON- point of view 
cranly ask 
-PRON- last phrase sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and dishearten excited brain over which -PRON- fume seem to brood 
look here cranly -PRON- say 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- what i would do and what i would not do 
i will tell -PRON- what i will do and what i will not do 
i will not serve that in which i no longer believe whether -PRON- call -PRON- -PRON- home -PRON- fatherland or -PRON- church and i will try to express -PRON- in some mode of life or art as freely as i can and as wholly as i can use for -PRON- defence the only arm i allow -PRON- to usesilence exile and cunning 
cranly seize -PRON- arm and steer -PRON- round so as to lead -PRON- back towards leeson park 
-PRON- laugh almost slily and press arm with an elder affection 
cunne indeed -PRON- say 
be -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- poor poet -PRON- 
and -PRON- make -PRON- confess to -PRON- stephen say thrill by -PRON- touch as i have confess to -PRON- so many other thing have i not 
yes -PRON- child cranly say still gaily 
-PRON- make -PRON- confess the fear that i have 
but i will tell -PRON- also what i do not fear 
i do not fear to be alone or to be spurn for another or to leave whatever i have to leave 
and i be not afraid to make a mistake even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too 
cranly now grave again slow -PRON- pace and say alone quite alone 
-PRON- have no fear of that 
and -PRON- know what that word mean 
not only to be separate from all other but to have not even one friend will take the risk say stephen 
and not to have any one person cranly say who would be more than a friend more even than the noble and true friend a man ever have 
-PRON- word seem to have strike some deep chord in -PRON- own nature 
have -PRON- speak of -PRON- of -PRON- as -PRON- be or wish to be 
stephen watch -PRON- face for some moment in silence
