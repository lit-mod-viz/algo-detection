a story of california by frank norris i just after passing saloon on the county road that ran south from bonneville and that divided the broderson ranch from that of los muertos presley was suddenly aware of the faint and prolonged blowing of a steam whistle that he knew must come from the railroad shops near the depot at bonneville
in starting out from the ranch house that morning he had forgotten his watch and was now perplexed to know whether the whistle was blowing for twelve or for one oclock
he hoped the former
early that morning he had decided to make a long excursion through the neighbouring country partly on foot and partly on his bicycle and now noon was come already and as yet he had hardly started
as he was leaving the house after breakfast mrs derrick had asked him to go for the mail at bonneville and he had not been able to refuse
he took a firmer hold of the cork grips of his road being in a wretched condition after the recent hauling of the quickened his pace
he told himself that no matter what the time was he would not stop for luncheon at the ranch house but would push on to guadalajara and have a spanish dinner at as he had originally planned
there had not been much of a crop to haul that year
half of the wheat on the broderson ranch had failed entirely and derrick himself had hardly raised more than enough to supply seed for the winters sowing
but such little hauling as there had been had reduced the roads thereabouts to a lamentable condition and during the dry season of the past few months the layer of dust had deepened and thickened to such an extent that more than once presley was obliged to dismount and trudge along on foot pushing his bicycle in front of him
it was the last half of september the very end of the dry season and all tulare county all the vast reaches of the san joaquin fact all south central california was bone dry parched and baked and crisped after four months of cloudless weather when the day seemed always at noon and the sun blazed white hot over the valley from the coast range in the west to the foothills of the sierras in the east
as presley drew near to the point where what was known as the lower road struck off through the rancho de los muertos leading on to guadalajara he came upon one of the county wateringtanks a great ironhooped tower of wood straddling clumsily on its four uprights by the roadside
since the day of its completion the storekeepers and retailers of bonneville had painted their advertisements upon it
it was a landmark
in that reach of level fields the white letters upon it could be read for miles
a wateringtrough stood near by and as he was very thirsty presley resolved to stop for a moment to get a drink
he drew abreast of the tank and halted there leaning his bicycle against the fence
a couple of men in white overalls were repainting the surface of the tank seated on swinging platforms that hung by hooks from the roof
they were painting a advertisement
it was all but finished and read behrman real estate mortgages main street bonneville opposite the post office
on the horsetrough that stood in the shadow of the tank was another freshly painted inscription behrman has something to say to you
as presley straightened up after drinking from the faucet at one end of the horsetrough the wateringcart itself laboured into view around the turn of the lower road
two mules and two horses white with dust strained leisurely in the traces moving at a snails pace their limp ears marking the time while perched high upon the seat under a yellow cotton wagon umbrella presley recognised hooven one of tenants a german whom every one called bismarck an excitable little man with a perpetual grievance and an endless flow of broken english
hello bismarck said presley as hooven brought his team to a standstill by the tank preparatory to refilling
yoost der men i look for praicely cried the other twisting the reins around the brake
yoost one minute you wait hey
i wanta talk mit you
presley was impatient to be on his way again
a little more time wasted and the day would be lost
he had nothing to do with the management of the ranch and if hooven wanted any advice from him it was so much breath wasted
these uncouth brutes of farmhands and petty ranchers grimed with the soil they worked upon were odious to him beyond words
never could he feel in sympathy with them nor with their lives their ways their marriages deaths bickerings and all the monotonous round of their sordid existence
well you must be quick about it bismarck he answered sharply late for dinner as it is
soh now
two minuten und i be mit you
he drew down the overhanging spout of the tank to the vent in the circumference of the cart and pulled the chain that let out the water
then he climbed down from the seat jumping from the tire of the wheel and taking presley by the arm led him a few steps down the road
say he began
say i want to hef some converzations mit you
yoost der men i want to see
say caraher he tole me dis morgensay he tole me derrick gowun to farm der whole demn rench hisseluf der next yahr
no more tenants
say caraher he tole me all der tenants get der sach derrick gowun to work der whole demn rench hisseluf hey
i get der sach alzoh hey
you hef hear about dose ting
say me i hef on der ranch been sieben yahr
do i alzoh have to see derrick himself or harran about that bismarck interrupted presley trying to draw away something outside of me entirely
but hooven was not to be put off
no doubt he had been meditating his speech all the morning formulating his words preparing his phrases
say no no he continued
me i wanta stay bei der place seven yahr i hef stay
derrick he doand want dot i should be gesacked
who den will der ditch getend
say you tell um bismarck hef gotta sure stay bei der place
say you hef der pull mit der governor
you speak der gut word for me
harran is the man that has the pull with his father bismarck answered presley
you get harran to speak for you and youre all right
sieben yahr i hef stay protested hooven and who will der ditch getend und alle dem cettles drive
well your man answered presley preparing to mount his bicycle
say you hef hear about dose ting donot hear about anything bismarck
i donot know the first thing about how the ranch is run
hooven burst out suddenly remembering a forgotten argument
he waved an arm
ach der pipeline bei der mission greek und der waaterhole for dose cettles
say he doand doo ut berhaps i doand tink
well talk to harran about it
say he doand farm der whole demn rench bei hisseluf
me i gotta stay
but on a sudden the water in the cart gushed over the sides from the vent in the top with a smart sound of splashing
hooven was forced to turn his attention to it
presley got his wheel under way hef some converzations mit herran hooven called after him
he doand doo ut bei hisseluf den derrick ach no
i stay bei der rench to drive dose cettles
he climbed back to his seat under the wagon umbrella and as he started his team again with great cracks of his long whip turned to the painters still at work upon the sign and declared with some defiance sieben yahr yais sir seiben yahr i hef been on dis rench
git oop you mule you hoop
meanwhile presley had turned into the lower road
he was now on land division no or as it was called the home ranch of the great los muertos rancho
the road was better here the dust laid after the passage of wateringcart and in a few minutes he had come to the ranch house itself with its white picket fence its few flower beds and grove of eucalyptus trees
on the lawn at the side of the house he saw harran in the act of setting out the automatic sprinkler
in the shade of the house by the porch were two or three of the greyhounds part of the pack that were used to hunt down jackrabbits and godfrey prize deerhound
presley wheeled up the driveway and met harran by the horseblock
harran was magnus youngest son a very welllooking young fellow of twentythree or twentyfive
he had the fine carriage that marked his father and still further resembled him in that he had the derrick and prominent such as one sees in the later portraits of the duke of wellington
he was blond and incessant exposure to the sun had instead of tanning him brown merely heightened the colour of his cheeks
his yellow hair had a tendency to curl in a forward direction just in front of the ears
beside him presley made the sharpest of contrasts
presley seemed to have come of a mixed origin appeared to have a nature more composite a temperament more complex
unlike harran derrick he seemed more of a character than a type
the sun had browned his face till it was almost swarthy
his eyes were a dark brown and his forehead was the forehead of the intellectual wide and high with a certain unmistakable lift about it that argued education not only of himself but of his people before him
the impression conveyed by his mouth and chin was that of a delicate and highly sensitive nature the lips thin and loosely shut together the chin small and rather receding
one guessed that refinement had been gained only by a certain loss of strength
one expected to find him nervous introspective to discover that his mental life was not at all the result of impressions and sensations that came to him from without but rather of thoughts and reflections germinating from within
though morbidly sensitive to changes in his physical surroundings he would be slow to act upon such sensations would not prove impulsive not because he was sluggish but because he was merely irresolute
it could be foreseen that morally he was of that sort who avoid evil through good taste lack of decision and want of opportunity
his temperament was that of the poet when he told himself he had been thinking he deceived himself
he had on such occasions been only brooding
some eighteen months before this time he had been threatened with consumption and taking advantage of a standing invitation on the part of magnus derrick had come to stay in the dry even climate of the san joaquin for an indefinite length of time
he was thirty years old and had graduated and postgraduated with high honours from an eastern college where he had devoted himself to a passionate study of literature and more especially of poetry
it was his insatiable ambition to write verse
but up to this time his work had been fugitive ephemeral a note here and there heard appreciated and forgotten
he was in search of a subject something magnificent he did not know exactly what some vast tremendous theme heroic terrible to be unrolled in all the thundering progression of hexameters
but whatever he wrote and in whatever fashion presley was determined that his poem should be of the west that worlds frontier of romance where a new race a new peoplehardy brave and building an empire where the tumultuous life ran like fire from dawn to dark and from dark to dawn again primitive brutal honest and without fear
something to his idea not much had been done to catch at that life in passing but its poet had not yet arisen
the few sporadic attempts thus he told himself had only touched the keynote
he strove for the diapason the great song that should embrace in itself a whole epoch a complete era the voice of an entire people wherein all people should be and their legends their folk lore their fightings their loves and their lusts their blunt grim humour their stoicism under stress their adventures their treasures found in a day and gambled in a night their direct crude speech their generosity and cruelty their heroism and bestiality their religion and profanity their selfsacrifice and true and fearless setting forth of a passing phase of history uncompromising sincere each group in its proper environment the valley the plain and the mountain the ranch the range and the this all the traits and types of every community from the dakotas to the mexicos from winnipeg to guadalupe gathered together swept together welded and riven together in one single mighty song the song of the west
that was what he dreamed while things without for which no man had yet invented words terrible formless shapes vague figures colossal monstrous at a gallop through his imagination
as harran came up presley reached down into the pouches of the sunbleached shooting coat he wore and drew out and handed him the packet of letters and papers the mail
i think i shall go on
but dinner is ready said harran we are just sitting down
presley shook his head
no in a hurry
perhaps i shall have something to eat at guadalajara
i shall be gone all day
he delayed a few moments longer tightening a loose nut on his forward wheel while harran recognising his fathers handwriting on one of the envelopes slit it open and cast his eye rapidly over its pages
the governor is coming home he exclaimed morning on the early train wants me to meet him with the team at guadalajara he cried between his clenched teeth as he continued to read lost the case
what case
oh in the matter of rates
harran nodded his eyes flashing his face growing suddenly scarlet
ulsteen gave his decision yesterday he continued reading from his fathers letter
he holds ulsteen does that grain rates as low as the new figure would amount to confiscation of property and that on such a basis the railroad could not be operated at a legitimate profit
as he is powerless to legislate in the matter he can only put the rates back at what they originally were before the commissioners made the cut and it is so ordered our friend behrman again added harran grinding his teeth
he was up in the city the whole of the time the new schedule was being drawn and he and ulsteen and the railroad commission were as thick as thieves
he has been up there all this last week too doing the railroads dirty work and backing ulsteen up
legitimate profit legitimate profit he broke out
can we raise wheat at a legitimate profit with a tariff of four dollars a ton for moving it two hundred miles to tidewater with wheat at eightyseven cents
why not hold us up with a gun in our faces and say hands up and be done with it
he dug his bootheel into the ground and turned away to the house abruptly cursing beneath his breath
by the way presley called after him hooven wants to see you
he asked me about this idea of the of getting along without the tenants this year
hooven wants to stay to tend the ditch and look after the stock
i told him to see you
harran his mind full of other things nodded to say he understood
presley only waited till he had disappeared indoors so that he might not seem too indifferent to his trouble then remounting struck at once into a brisk pace and turning out from the carriage gate held on swiftly down the lower road going in the direction of guadalajara
these matters these eternal fierce bickerings between the farmers of the san joaquin and the pacific and southwestern railroad irritated him and wearied him
he cared for none of these things
they did not belong to his world
in the picture of that huge romantic west that he saw in his imagination these dissensions made the one note of harsh colour that refused to enter into the great scheme of harmony
it was material sordid deadly commonplace
but however he strove to shut his eyes to it or his ears to it the thing persisted and persisted
the romance seemed complete up to that point
there it broke there it failed there it became realism grim unlovely unyielding
to be it was the first article of his creed to be unflinchingly could not ignore it
all the noble poetry of the in his mind to be marred and disfigured by the presence of certain immovable facts
just what he wanted presley hardly knew
on one hand it was his ambition to portray life as he saw itdirectly frankly and through no medium of personality or temperament
but on the other hand as well he wished to see everything through a rosecoloured mist that dulled all harsh outlines all crude and violent colours
he told himself that as a part of the people he loved the people and sympathised with their hopes and fears and joys and griefs and yet hooven grimy and perspiring with his perpetual grievance and his contracted horizon only revolted him
he had set himself the task of giving true absolutely true poetical expression to the life of the ranch and yet again and again he brought up against the railroad that stubborn iron barrier against which his romance shattered itself to froth and disintegrated flying spume
his heart went out to the people and his groping hand met that of a slovenly little dutchman whom it was impossible to consider seriously
he searched for the true romance and in the end found grain rates and unjust freight tariffs
but the stuff is he muttered as he sent his wheel rumbling across the bridge over broderson creek
the romance the real romance is here somewhere get hold of it yet
he shot a glance about him as if in search of the inspiration
by now he was not quite half way across the northern and narrowest corner of los muertos at this point some eight miles wide
he was still on the home ranch
a few miles to the south he could just make out the line of wire fence that separated it from the third division and to the north seen faint and blue through the haze and shimmer of the noon sun a long file of telegraph poles showed the line of the railroad and marked northeast boundary
the road over which presley was travelling ran almost diametrically straight
in front of him but at a great distance he could make out the giant liveoak and the red roof of barn that stood near it
all about him the country was flat
in all directions he could see for miles
the harvest was just over
nothing but stubble remained on the ground
with the one exception of the liveoak by place there was nothing green in sight
the wheat stubble was of a dirty yellow the ground parched cracked and dry of a cheerless brown
by the roadside the dust lay thick and grey and on either hand stretching on toward the horizon losing itself in a mere smudge in the distance ran the illimitable parallels of the wire fence
and that was all that and the burntout blue of the sky and the steady shimmer of the heat
the silence was infinite
after the harvest small though that harvest had been the ranches seemed asleep
it was as though the earth after its period of reproduction its pains of labour had been delivered of the fruit of its loins and now slept the sleep of exhaustion
it was the period between seasons when nothing was being done when the natural forces seemed to hang suspended
there was no rain there was no wind there was no growth no life the very stubble had no force even to rot
the sun alone moved
toward two oclock presley reached place two or three grimy frame buildings infested with a swarm of dogs
a hog or two wandered aimlessly about
under a shed by the barn a brokendown seeder lay rusting to its ruin
but overhead a mammoth liveoak the largest tree in all the countryside towered superb and magnificent
grey bunches of mistletoe and festoons of trailing moss hung from its bark
from its lowest branch hung meatsafe a square box faced with wire screens
what gave a special interest to was the fact that here was the intersection of the lower road and main irrigating ditch a vast trench not yet completed which he and annixter who worked the quien sabe ranch were jointly constructing
it ran directly across the road and at right angles to it and lay a deep groove in the field between and the town of guadalajara some three miles farther on
besides this the ditch was a natural boundary between two divisions of the los muertos ranch the first and fourth
presley now had the choice of two routes
his objective point was the spring at the headwaters of broderson creek in the hills on the eastern side of the quien sabe ranch
the trail afforded him a short cut thitherward
as he passed the house mrs hooven came to the door her little daughter hilda dressed in a boys overalls and clumsy boots at her skirts
minna her oldest daughter a very pretty girl whose love affairs were continually the talk of all los muertos was visible through a window of the house busy at the weeks washing
mrs hooven was a faded colourless woman middleaged and commonplace and offering not the least characteristic that would distinguish her from a thousand other women of her class and kind
she nodded to presley watching him with a stolid gaze from under her arm which she held across her forehead to shade her eyes
but now presley exerted himself in good earnest
his bicycle flew
he resolved that after all he would go to guadalajara
he crossed the bridge over the irrigating ditch with a brusque spurt of hollow sound and shot forward down the last stretch of the lower road that yet intervened between and the town
he was on the fourth division of the ranch now the only one whereon the wheat had been successful no doubt because of the little mission creek that ran through it
but he no longer occupied himself with the landscape
his only concern was to get on as fast as possible
he had looked forward to spending nearly the whole day on the crest of the wooded hills in the northern corner of the quien sabe ranch reading idling smoking his pipe
but now he would do well if he arrived there by the middle of the afternoon
in a few moments he had reached the line fence that marked the limits of the ranch
here were the railroad tracks and just huddled mass of roofs with here and there an adobe house on its little town of guadalajara
nearer at hand and directly in front of presley were the freight and passenger depots of the and painted in the grey and white which seemed to be the official colours of all the buildings owned by the corporation
the station was deserted
no trains passed at this hour
from the direction of the ticket window presley heard the unsteady chittering of the telegraph key
in the shadow of one of the baggage trucks upon the platform the great yellow cat that belonged to the agent dozed complacently her paws tucked under her body
three flat cars loaded with brightpainted farming machines were on the siding above the station while on the switch below a huge freight engine that lacked its cowcatcher sat back upon its monstrous drivingwheels motionless solid drawing long breaths that were punctuated by the subdued sound of its steampump clicking at exact intervals
but evidently it had been decreed that presley should be stopped at every point of his ride that day for as he was pushing his bicycle across the tracks he was surprised to hear his name called
hello there mr presley the good word
presley looked up quickly and saw dyke the engineer leaning on his folded arms from the cab window of the freight engine
but at the prospect of this further delay presley was less troubled
dyke and he were well acquainted and the best of friends
the picturesqueness of the engineers life was always attractive to presley and more than once he had ridden on engine between guadalajara and bonneville
once even he had made the entire run between the latter town and san francisco in the cab home was in guadalajara
he lived in one of the remodelled dobe cottages where his mother kept house for him
his wife had died some five years before this time leaving him a little daughter sidney to bring up as best he could
dyke himself was a heavy built welllooking fellow nearly twice the weight of presley with great shoulders and massive hairy arms and a tremendous rumbling voice
hello old man answered presley coming up to the engine
what are you doing about here at this time of day
i thought you were on the night service this month changed about a bit answered the other
come up here and sit down and get out of the sun held us here to wait orders he explained as presley after leaning his bicycle against the tender climbed to the firemans seat of worn green leather
they are changing the run of one of the crack passenger engines down below and are sending her up to fresno
there was a smash of some kind on the bakersfield division and shes to hell and gone behind her time
i suppose when she comes shell come ahumming
it will be stand clear and an open track all the way to fresno
they have held me here to let her go by
he took his pipe an old clay but coloured to a beautiful shiny black from the pocket of his jumper and filled and lit it
well i donot suppose you object to being held here observed presley
gives you a chance to visit your mother and the little girl
and precisely they choose this day to go up to sacramento answered dyke
just my luck
went up to visit my brothers people
by the way my brother may come down here i go into the hopraising business got an option on five hundred acres just back of the town here
he says there is going to be money in hops
i donot know may be go in with him
why whats the matter with railroading
dyke drew a couple of puffs on his pipe and fixed presley with a glance this the matter with it he said fired
fired
you exclaimed presley turning abruptly toward him what telling you returned dyke grimly
you donot mean it
why what for dyke
now tell me what for growled the other savagely
boy and man worked for the and for over ten years and never one yelp of a complaint did i ever hear from them
they know damn well theyve not got a steadier man on the road
and more than that more than that i donot belong to the brotherhood
and when the strike came along i stood by by the company
you know that
and you know and they know that at sacramento that time i ran my train according to schedule with a gun in each hand never knowing when i was going over a mined culvert and there was talk of giving me a gold watch at the time
to hell with their gold watches
i want ordinary justice and fair treatment
and now when hard times come along and they are cutting wages what do they do
do they make any discrimination in my case
do they remember the man that stood by them and risked his life in their service
no
they cut my pay down just as offhand as they do the pay of any dirty little wiper in the yard
cut me along to me along with men that they had strikers that they took back because they were short of hands
he drew fiercely on his pipe went to them yes i did i went to the general office and ate dirt
i told them i was a family man and that i didnot see how i was going to get along on the new scale and i reminded them of my service during the strike
the swine told me that it wouldnot be fair to discriminate in favour of one man and that the cut must apply to all their employees alike
fair he shouted with laughter
fair
hear the and talking about fairness and discrimination good that is
well i got furious
i was a fool i suppose
i told them that in justice to myself i wouldnot do firstclass work for thirdclass pay
and they said well mr dyke you know what you can do
well i did know
i said ask for my time if you please and they gave it to me just as if they were glad to be shut of me
so there you are presley the railroad company of california
i am on my last run now
shameful declared presley his sympathies all aroused now that the trouble concerned a friend of his shameful dyke
but he added an idea occurring to him that donot shut you out from work
there are other railroads in the state that are not controlled by the and dyke smote his knee with his clenched fist
presley was silent challenge was unanswerable
there was a lapse in their talk presley drumming on the arm of the seat meditating on this injustice dyke looking off over the fields beyond the town his frown lowering his teeth rasping upon his pipestem
the station agent came to the door of the depot stretching and yawning
on ahead of the engine the empty rails of the track reaching out toward the horizon threw off visible layers of heat
the telegraph key clicked incessantly
so going to quit dyke remarked after a while his anger somewhat subsided
my brother and i will take up this hop ranch saved a good deal in the last ten years and there ought to be money in hops
presley went on remounting his bicycle wheeling silently through the deserted streets of the decayed and dying mexican town
it was the hour of the siesta
nobody was about
there was no business in the town
it was too close to bonneville for that
before the railroad came and in the days when the raising of cattle was the great industry of the country it had enjoyed a fierce and brilliant life
now it was moribund
the drug store the two barrooms the hotel at the corner of the old plaza and the shops where mexican curios were sold to those occasional eastern tourists who came to visit the mission of san juan sufficed for the towns activity
at the restaurant on the plaza diagonally across from the hotel presley ate his longdeferred mexican omelette in spanishmexican style frijoles and tortillas a salad and a glass of white wine
in a corner of the room during the whole course of his dinner two young mexicans one of whom was astonishingly handsome after the melodramatic fashion of his race and an old fellow the centenarian of the town decrepit beyond belief sang an interminable lovesong to the accompaniment of a guitar and an accordion
these spanishmexicans decayed picturesque vicious and romantic never failed to interest presley
a few of them still remained in guadalajara drifting from the saloon to the restaurant and from the restaurant to the plaza relics of a former generation standing for a different order of things absolutely idle living god knew how happy with their cigarette their guitar their glass of mescal and their siesta
the centenarian remembered fremont and governor alvarado and the bandit jesus tejeda and the days when los muertos was a spanish grant a veritable principality leagues in extent and when there was never a fence from visalia to fresno
upon this occasion presley offered the old man a drink of mescal and excited him to talk of the things he remembered
their talk was in spanish a language with which presley was familiar
de la cuesta held the grant of los muertos in those days the centenarian said a grand man
he had the power of life and death over his people and there was no law but his word
there was no thought of wheat then you may believe
it was all cattle in those days sheep horsessteers not so if money was scarce there was always plenty to eat and clothes enough for all and wine ah yes by the vat and oil too the mission fathers had that
yes and there was wheat as well now that i come to think but a very the field north of the mission where now it is the seed ranch wheat fields were there and also a vineyard all on mission grounds
wheat olives and the vine the fathers planted those to provide the elements of the holy oil and wine you understand
it was like that those industries began in the church and now he put his chin in the air what would father ullivari have said to such a crop as senor derrick plants these days
ten thousand acres of wheat
nothing but wheat from the sierra to the coast range
i remember when de la cuesta was married
he had never seen the young lady only her miniature portrait raised a do not know by whom small a little thing to be held in the palm
but he fell in love with that and marry her he would
the affair was arranged between him and the girls parents
but when the time came that de la cuesta was to go to monterey to meet and marry the girl behold jesus tejeda broke in upon the small rancheros near terrabella
it was no time for de la cuesta to be away so he sent his brother esteban to monterey to marry the girl by proxy for him
i went with esteban
we were a company nearly a hundred men
and de la cuesta sent a horse for the girl to ride white pure white and the saddle was of red leather the headstall the bit and buckles all the metal work of virgin silver
well there was a ceremony in the monterey mission and esteban in the name of his brother was married to the girl
on our way back de la cuesta rode out to meet us
his company met ours at agatha dos palos
never will i forget de la face as his eyes fell upon the girl
it was a look a glance come and gone like he snapped his fingers
no one but i saw it but i was close by
there was no mistaking that look
de la cuesta was disappointed
and the girl demanded presley
she never knew
ah he was a grand gentleman de la cuesta
always he treated her as a queen
never was husband more devoted more respectful more chivalrous
but love
the old fellow put his chin in the air shutting his eyes in a knowing fashion
it was not there
i could tell
they were married over again at the mission san juan de for a week all the town of guadalajara was in fete
there were bullfights in the very five days and to each of his tenantsinchief de la cuesta gave a horse a barrel of tallow an ounce of silver and half an ounce of gold dust
ah those were days
that was a gay life made a comprehensive gesture with his left is stupid
you may well say that observed presley moodily discouraged by the others talk
all his doubts and uncertainty had returned to him
never would he grasp the subject of his great poem the life was colourless
romance was dead
he had lived too late
to write of the past was not what he desired
reality was what he longed for things that he had seen
yet how to make this compatible with romance
he rose putting on his hat offering the old man a cigarette
the centenarian accepted with the air of a grandee and extended his horn snuffbox
presley shook his head was born too late for that he declared for that and for many other things
adios
you are travelling today senor little turn through the country to get the kinks out of the muscles presley answered go up into the quien sabe into the high country beyond the mission
ah the quien sabe rancho
the sheep are grazing there this week
solotari the keeper of the restaurant explained young annixter sold his wheat stubble on the ground to the sheep raisers off yonder he motioned eastward toward the sierra foothills
since sunday the herd has been down
very clever that young annixter
he gets a price for his stubble which else he would have to burn and also manures his land as the sheep move from place to place
a true yankee that annixter a good gringo
after his meal presley once more mounted his bicycle and leaving the restaurant and the plaza behind him held on through the main street of the drowsing street that farther on developed into the road which turned abruptly northward and led onward through the hopfields and the quien sabe ranch toward the mission of san juan
the home ranch of the quien sabe was in the little triangle bounded on the south by the railroad on the northwest by broderson creek and on the east by the hop fields and the mission lands
it was traversed in all directions now by the trail from now by the irrigating same which presley had crossed earlier in the again by the road upon which presley then found himself
in its centre were ranch house and barns topped by the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well that was to feed the irrigating ditch
farther on the course of broderson creek was marked by a curved line of greygreen willows while on the low hills to the north as presley advanced the ancient mission of san juan de guadalajara with its belfry tower and redtiled roof began to show itself over the crests of the venerable pear trees that clustered in its garden
when presley reached ranch house he found young annixter himself stretched in his hammock behind the mosquitobar on the front porch reading david copperfield and gorging himself with dried prunes the two had exchanged of terrific colics all the preceding night
his stomach was out of whack but you bet he knew how to take care of himself the last spell he had consulted a doctor at bonneville a gibbering busyface who had filled him up to the neck with a dose of some hogwash stuff that had made him healthy lot the doctors knew anyhow case was peculiar knew prunes were what he needed and by the pound
annixter who worked the quien sabe four thousand acres of rich clay and heavy a very young man younger even than presley like him a college graduate
he looked never a year older than he was
he was smoothshaven and lean built
but his youthful appearance was offset by a certain male cast of countenance the lower lip thrust out the chin large and deeply cleft
his university course had hardened rather than polished him
he still remained one of the people rough almost to insolence direct in speech intolerant in his opinions relying upon absolutely no one but himself yet with all this of an astonishing degree of intelligence and possessed of an executive ability little short of positive genius
he was a ferocious worker allowing himself no pleasures and exacting the same degree of energy from all his subordinates
he was widely hated and as widely trusted
every one spoke of his crusty temper and bullying disposition invariably qualifying the statement with a commendation of his resources and capabilities
the devil of a driver a hard man to get along with obstinate contrary cantankerous but brains
no doubt of that brains to his boots
one would like to see the man who could get ahead of him on a deal
twice he had been shot at once from ambush on ranch and once by one of his own men whom he had kicked from the sacking platform of his harvester for gross negligence
at college he had specialised on finance political economy and scientific agriculture
after his graduation he stood almost at the very top of his class he had returned and obtained the degree of civil engineer
then suddenly he had taken a notion that a practical knowledge of law was indispensable to a modern farmer
in eight months he did the work of three years studying for his bar examinations
his method of study was characteristic
he reduced all the material of his textbooks to notes
tearing out the leaves of these notebooks he pasted them upon the walls of his room then in his shirtsleeves a cheap cigar in his teeth his hands in his pockets he walked around and around the room scowling fiercely at his notes memorising devouring digesting
at intervals he drank great cupfuls of unsweetened black coffee
when the bar examinations were held he was admitted at the very head of all the applicants and was complimented by the judge
immediately afterwards he collapsed with nervous prostration his stomach got out of whack and he all but died in a sacramento boardinghouse obstinately refusing to have anything to do with doctors whom he vituperated as a rabble of quacks dosing himself with a patent medicine and stuffing himself almost to bursting with liver pills and dried prunes
he had taken a trip to europe after this sickness to put himself completely to rights
he intended to be gone a year but returned at the end of six weeks fulminating abuse of european cooking
nearly his entire time had been spent in paris but of this sojourn he had brought back but two souvenirs an electroplated billhook and an empty bird cage which had tickled his fancy immensely
he was wealthy
only a year previous to this his widower who had amassed a fortune in land died and annixter the only son had come into the inheritance
for presley annixter professed a great admiration holding in deep respect the man who could rhyme words deferring to him whenever there was question of literature or works of fiction
no doubt there was not much use in poetry and as for novels to his mind there were only works
everything else was a lot of lies
but just the same it took brains to grind out a poem
it wasnot every one who could rhyme brave and glaive and make sense out of it
sure not
but case was a notable exception
on no occasion was annixter prepared to accept another mans opinion without reserve
in conversation with him it was almost impossible to make any direct statement however trivial that he would accept without either modification or open contradiction
he had a passion for violent discussion
he would argue upon every subject in the range of human knowledge from astronomy to the tariff from the doctrine of predestination to the height of a horse
never would he admit himself to be mistaken when cornered he would intrench himself behind the remark yes thats all very well
in some ways it is and then again in some ways it singularly enough he and presley were the best of friends
more than once presley marvelled at this state of affairs telling himself that he and annixter had nothing in common
in all his circle of acquaintances presley was the one man with whom annixter had never quarrelled
the two men were diametrically opposed in temperament
presley was easygoing annixter alert
presley was a confirmed dreamer irresolute inactive with a strong tendency to melancholy the young farmer was a man of affairs decisive combative whose only reflection upon his interior economy was a morbid concern in the vagaries of his stomach
yet the two never met without a mutual pleasure taking a genuine interest in each others affairs and often putting themselves to great inconvenience to be of trifling service to help one another
as a last characteristic annixter pretended to be a womanhater for no other reason than that he was a very bullcalf of awkwardness in feminine surroundings
feemales
rot
there was a fine way for a man to waste his time and his good money lally gagging with a lot of feemales
no thank you none of it in if you please
once only he had an timid little creature in a glovecleaning establishment in sacramento whom he had picked up heaven knew how
after his return to his ranch a correspondence had been maintained between the two annixter taking the precaution to typewrite his letters and never affixing his signature in an excess of prudence
he furthermore made carbon copies of all his letters filing them away in a compartment of his safe
ah it would be a clever feemale who would get him into a mess
then suddenly smitten with a panic terror that he had committed himself that he was involving himself too deeply he had abruptly sent the little woman about her business
it was his only love affair
after that he kept himself free
no petticoats should ever have a hold on him
sure not
as presley came up to the edge of the porch pushing his bicycle in front of him annixter excused himself for not getting up alleging that the cramps returned the moment he was off his back
what are you doing up this way he demanded
oh just having a look around answered presley the ranch
say observed the other ignoring his question this i hear about derrick giving his tenants the bounce and working los muertos his land
presley made a sharp movement of impatience with his free hand heard nothing else myself since morning
i suppose it must be so
huh grunted annixter spitting out a prune stone
you give magnus derrick my compliments and tell him hes a fool
what do you mean suppose derrick thinks hes still running his mine and that the same principles will apply to getting grain out of the earth as to getting gold
oh let him go on and see where he brings up right theres your western farmer he exclaimed contemptuously
get the guts out of your land work it to death never give it a rest
never alternate your crop and then when your soil is exhausted sit down and roar about hard times suppose magnus thinks the land has had rest enough these last two dry seasons observed presley
he has raised no crop to speak of for two years
the land has had a good rest
ah yes that sounds well annixter contradicted unwilling to be convinced
in a way the lands been rested and then again in a way it hasnot
but presley scenting an argument refrained from answering and bethought himself of moving on going to leave my wheel here for a while buck he said if you donot mind going up to the spring and the road is rough between here and there
stop in for dinner on your way back said annixter be a venison steak
one of the boys got a deer over in the foothills last week
out of season but never mind that
i canot eat it
this stomach of mine wouldnot digest sweet oil today
get here about six
well maybe i will thank you said presley moving off
by the way he added see your barn is about done
you bet answered annixter
in about a fortnight now shell be all ready a big barn murmured presley glancing around the angle of the house toward where the great structure stood
guess well have to have a dance there before we move the stock in observed annixter the custom all around here
presley took himself off but at the gate annixter called after him his mouth full of prunes say take a look at that herd of sheep as you go up
they are right off here to the east of the road about half a mile from here
i guess thats the biggest lot of sheep ever saw
you might write a poem about em sheep days
catch on
beyond broderson creek as presley advanced tramping along on foot now the land opened out again into the same vast spaces of dull brown earth sprinkled with stubble such as had been characteristic of ranch
to the east the reach seemed infinite flat cheerless heatridden unrolling like a gigantic scroll toward the faint shimmer of the distant horizons with here and there an isolated liveoak to break the sombre monotony
but bordering the road to the westward the surface roughened and raised clambering up to the higher ground on the crest of which the old mission and its surrounding pear trees were now plainly visible
just beyond the mission the road bent abruptly eastward striking off across the seed ranch
but presley left the road at this point going on across the open fields
there was no longer any trail
it was toward three oclock
the sun still spun a silent blazing disc high in the heavens and tramping through the clods of uneven broken plough was fatiguing work
the slope of the lowest foothills begun the surface of the country became rolling and suddenly as he topped a higher ridge presley came upon the sheep
already he had passed the larger part of the intervening rise of ground having hidden it from sight
now as he turned half way about looking down into the shallow hollow between him and the curve of the creek he saw them very plainly
the fringe of the herd was some two hundred yards distant but its farther side in that illusive shimmer of hot surface air seemed miles away
the sheep were spread out roughly in the shape of a figure eight two larger herds connected by a smaller and were headed to the southward moving slowly grazing on the wheat stubble as they proceeded
but the number seemed incalculable
hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of grey rounded backs all exactly alike huddled closepacked alive hid the earth from sight
it was no longer an aggregate of individuals
it was a compact solid slowly moving mass huge without form like a thickpressed growth of mushrooms spreading out in all directions over the earth
from it there arose a vague murmur confused inarticulate like the sound of very distant surf while all the air in the vicinity was heavy with the warm ammoniacal odour of the thousands of crowding bodies
all the colours of the scene were brown of the earth the faded yellow of the dead stubble the grey of the myriad of undulating backs
only on the far side of the herd erect single note of black a speck a shepherd stood leaning upon an empty watertrough solitary grave impressive
for a few moments presley stood watching
then as he started to move on a curious thing occurred
at first he thought he had heard some one call his name
he paused listening there was no sound but the vague noise of the moving sheep
then as this first impression passed it seemed to him that he had been beckoned to
yet nothing stirred except for the lonely figure beyond the herd there was no one in sight
he started on again and in half a dozen steps found himself looking over his shoulder
without knowing why he looked toward the shepherd then halted and looked a second time and a third
had the shepherd called to him
presley knew that he had heard no voice
brusquely all his attention seemed riveted upon this distant figure
he put one forearm over his eyes to keep off the sun gazing across the intervening herd
surely the shepherd had called him
but at the next instant he started uttering an exclamation under his breath
the faraway speck of black became animated
presley remarked a sweeping gesture
though the man had not beckoned to him before there was no doubt that he was beckoning now
without any hesitation and singularly interested in the incident presley turned sharply aside and hurried on toward the shepherd skirting the herd wondering all the time that he should answer the call with so little question so little hesitation
but the shepherd came forward to meet presley followed by one of his dogs
as the two men approached each other presley closely studying the other began to wonder where he had seen him before
it must have been a very long time ago upon one of his previous visits to the ranch
certainly however there was something familiar in the shepherds face and figure
when they came closer to each other and presley could see him more distinctly this sense of a previous acquaintance was increased and sharpened
the shepherd was a man of about thirtyfive
he was very lean and spare
his brown canvas overalls were thrust into laced boots
a cartridge belt without any cartridges encircled his waist
a grey flannel shirt open at the throat showed his breast tanned and ruddy
he wore no hat
his hair was very black and rather long
a pointed beard covered his chin growing straight and fine from the hollow cheeks
the absence of any covering for his head was no doubt habitual with him for his face was as brown as an ruddy brown quite different from dark olive
to morbidly keen observation the general impression of the shepherds face was intensely interesting
it was uncommon to an astonishing degree vivid imagination chose to see in it the face of an ascetic of a recluse almost that of a young seer
so must have appeared the halfinspired shepherds of the hebraic legends the younger prophets of israel dwellers in the wilderness beholders of visions having their existence in a continual dream talkers with god gifted with strange powers
suddenly at some twenty paces distant from the approaching shepherd presley stopped short his eyes riveted upon the other
vanamee he exclaimed
the shepherd smiled and came forward holding out his hands saying thought it was you
when i saw you come over the hill i called you
but not with your voice returned presley knew that some one wanted me
i felt it
i should have remembered that you could do that kind of thing have never known it to fail
it helps with the sheep
with the sheep
in a way
i canot tell exactly how
we donot understand these things yet
there are times when if i close my eyes and dig my fists into my temples i can hold the entire herd for perhaps a minute
perhaps though its imagination who knows
but its good to see you again
how long has it been since the last time
two three nearly five years
it was more than that
it was six years since presley and vanamee had met and then it had been for a short time only during one of the shepherds periodical brief returns to that part of the country
during a week he and presley had been much together for the two were devoted friends
then as abruptly as mysteriously as he had come vanamee disappeared
presley awoke one morning to find him gone
thus it had been with vanamee for a period of sixteen years
he lived his life in the unknown one could not tell the desert in the mountains throughout all the vast and vague solitary strange
three four five years passed
the shepherd would be almost forgotten
never the most trivial scrap of information as to his whereabouts reached los muertos
he had melted off into the surfaceshimmer of the desert into the mirage he sank below the horizons he was swallowed up in the waste of sand and sage
then without warning he would reappear coming in from the wilderness emerging from the unknown
no one knew him well
in all that countryside he had but three friends presley magnus derrick and the priest at the mission of san juan de guadalajara father sarria
he remained always a mystery living a life halfreal halflegendary
in all those years he did not seem to have grown older by a single day
at this time presley knew him to be thirtysix years of age
but since the first day the two had met the shepherds face and bearing had to his eyes remained the same
at this moment presley was looking into the same face he had first seen many many years ago
it was a face stamped with an unspeakable sadness a deathless grief the permanent imprint of a tragedy long past but yet a living issue
presley told himself that it was impossible to look long into eyes without knowing that here was a man whose whole being had been at one time shattered and riven to its lowest depths whose life had suddenly stopped at a certain moment of its development
the two friends sat down upon the ledge of the wateringtrough their eyes wandering incessantly toward the slow moving herd grazing on the wheat stubble moving southward as they grazed
where have you come from this time
presley had asked
where have you kept yourself
the other swept the horizon to the south and east with a vague gesture
off there down to the south very far off
so many places that i canot remember
i went the long trail this time a long long ways
arizona the mexicos and then afterwards utah and nevada following the horizon travelling at hazard
into arizona first going in by monument pass and then on to the south through the country of the navajos down by the aga thia great blade of red rock jutting from out the desert like a knife thrust
then on and on through the mexicos all through the southwest then back again in a great circle by chihuahua and aldama to laredo to torreon and albuquerque
from there across the uncompahgre plateau into the uintah country then at last due west through nevada to california and to the valley of the san joaquin
his voice lapsed to a monotone his eyes becoming fixed he continued to speak as though half awake his thoughts elsewhere seeing again in the eye of his mind the reach of desert and red hill the purple mountain the level stretch of alkali leper white all the savage gorgeous desolation of the long trail
he ignored presley for the moment but on the other hand presley himself gave him but half his attention
the return of vanamee had stimulated the poets memory
he recalled the incidents of life reviewing again that terrible drama which had uprooted his soul which had driven him forth a wanderer a shunner of men a sojourner in waste places
he was strangely enough a college graduate and a man of wide reading and great intelligence but he had chosen to lead his own life which was that of a recluse
of a temperament similar in many ways to there were capabilities in vanamee that were not ordinarily to be found in the rank and file of men
living close to nature a poet by instinct where presley was but a poet by training there developed in him a great sensitiveness to beauty and an almost abnormal capacity for great happiness and great sorrow he felt things intensely deeply
he never forgot
it was when he was eighteen or nineteen at the formative and most impressionable period of his life that he had met angele varian
presley barely remembered her as a girl of sixteen beautiful almost beyond expression who lived with an aged aunt on the seed ranch back of the mission
at this moment he was trying to recall how she looked with her hair of gold hanging in two straight plaits on either side of her face making threecornered her round white forehead her wonderful eyes violet blue heavy lidded with their astonishing upward slant toward the temples the slant that gave a strange oriental cast to her face perplexing enchanting
he remembered the egyptian fulness of the lips the strange balancing movement of her head upon her slender neck the same movement that one sees in a snake at poise
never had he seen a girl more radiantly beautiful never a beauty so strange so troublous so out of all accepted standards
it was small wonder that vanamee had loved her and less wonder still that his love had been so intense so passionate so part of himself
angele had loved him with a love no less than his own
it was one of those legendary passions that sometimes occur idyllic untouched by civilisation spontaneous as the growth of trees natural as dewfall strong as the firmseated mountains
at the time of his meeting with angele vanamee was living on the los muertos ranch
it was there he had chosen to spend one of his college vacations
but he preferred to pass it in work sometimes herding cattle sometimes pitching hay sometimes working with pick and dynamitestick on the ditches in the fourth division of the ranch riding the range mending breaks in the wire fences making himself generally useful
college bred though he was the life pleased him
he was as he desired close to nature living the full measure of life a worker among workers taking enjoyment in simple pleasures healthy in mind and body
he believed in an existence passed in this fashion in the country working hard eating full drinking deep sleeping dreamlessly
but every night after supper he saddled his pony and rode over to the garden of the old mission
the dobe dividing wall on that side which once had separated the mission garden and the seed ranch had long since crumbled away and the boundary between the two pieces of ground was marked only by a line of venerable pear trees
here under these trees he found angele awaiting him and there the two would sit through the hot still evening their arms about each other watching the moon rise over the foothills listening to the trickle of the water in the mossencrusted fountain in the garden and the steady croak of the great frogs that lived in the damp north corner of the enclosure
through all one summer the enchantment of that newfound wonderful love pure and untainted filled the lives of each of them with its sweetness
the summer passed the harvest moon came and went
the nights were very dark
in the deep shade of the pear trees they could no longer see each other
when they met at the rendezvous vanamee found her only with his groping hands
they did not speak mere words were useless between them
silently as his reaching hands touched her warm body he took her in his arms searching for her lips with his
then one night the tragedy had suddenly leaped from out the shadow with the abruptness of an explosion
it was impossible afterwards to reconstruct the manner of its occurrence
to there was left of matter always remained a hideous blur a blot a vague terrible confusion
no doubt they two had been watched the plan succeeded too well for any other supposition
one moonless night angele arriving under the black shadow of the pear trees a little earlier than usual found the apparently familiar figure waiting for her
all unsuspecting she gave herself to the embrace of a strange pair of arms and vanamee arriving but a score of moments later stumbled over her prostrate body inert and unconscious in the shadow of the overspiring trees
who was the other
angele was carried to her home on the seed ranch delirious all but raving and vanamee with knife and revolver ready ranged the countryside like a wolf
he was not alone
the whole county rose raging horrorstruck
posse after posse was formed sent out and returned without so much as a clue
upon no one could even the shadow of suspicion be thrown
the other had withdrawn into an impenetrable mystery
there he remained
he never was found he never was so much as heard of
a legend arose about him this prowler of the night this strange fearful figure with an unseen face swooping in there from out the darkness come and gone in an instant but leaving behind him a track of terror and death and rage and undying grief
within the year in giving birth to the child angele had died
the little babe was taken by parents and angele was buried in the mission garden near to the aged grey sun dial
vanamee stood by during the ceremony but half conscious of what was going forward
at the last moment he had stepped forward looked long into the dead face framed in its plaits of gold hair the hair that made threecornered the round white forehead looked again at the closed eyes with their perplexing upward slant toward the temples oriental bizarre at the lips with their egyptian fulness at the sweet slender neck the long slim hands then abruptly turned about
the last clods were filling the grave at a time when he was already far away his horses head turned toward the desert
for two years no syllable was heard of him
it was believed that he had killed himself
but vanamee had no thought of that
for two years he wandered through arizona living in the desert in the wilderness a recluse a nomad an ascetic
but doubtless all his heart was in the little coffin in the mission garden
once in so often he must come back thither
one day he was seen again in the san joaquin
the priest father sarria returning from a visit to the sick at bonneville met him on the upper road
eighteen years had passed since angele had died but the thread of life had been snapped
nothing remained now but the tangled ends
he had never forgotten
the long dull ache the poignant grief had now become a part of him
presley knew this to be so
while presley had been reflecting upon all this vanamee had continued to speak
presley however had not been wholly inattentive
while his memory was busy reconstructing the details of the drama of the shepherds life another part of his brain had been swiftly registering picture after picture that monotonous flow of words struck off as it were upon a steadily moving scroll
the music of the unfamiliar names that occurred in his recital was a stimulant to the poets imagination
presley had the poets passion for expressive sonorous names
as these came and went in monotonous undertones like little notes of harmony in a musical progression he listened delighted with their quijotoa uintah sonora laredo him they were so many symbols
it was his west that passed unrolling there before the eye of his mind the open heatscourged round of desert the mesa like a vast altar shimmering purple in the royal sunset the still gigantic mountains heaving into the sky from out the canyons the strenuous fierce life of isolated towns lost and forgotten down there far off below the horizon
abruptly his great poem his song of the west leaped up again in his imagination
for the moment he all but held it
it was there close at hand
in another instant he would grasp it
yes yes he exclaimed can see it all
the desert the mountains all wild primordial untamed
how i should have loved to have been with you
then perhaps i should have got hold of my idea
your idea
the great poem of the west that which i want to write
oh to put it all into hexameters strike the great iron note sing the vast terrible song the song of the people the forerunners of empire
vanamee understood him perfectly
he nodded gravely
yes it is there
it is life the primitive simple direct life passionate tumultuous
yes there is an epic there
presley caught at the word
it had never before occurred to him
epic yes thats it
it is the epic searching for
and i search for it
you donot know
it is sometimes almost an agony
often and often i can feel it right there there at my fingertips but i never quite catch it
it always eludes me
i was born too late
ah to get back to that first cleareyed view of things to see as homer saw as beowulf saw as the nibelungen poets saw
the life is here the same as then the poem is here my west is here the primeval epic life is here here under our hands in the desert in the mountain on the ranch all over here from winnipeg to guadalupe
it is the man who is lacking the poet we have been educated away from it all
we are out of touch
we are out of tune
vanamee heard him to the end his grave sad face thoughtful and attentive
then he rose am going over to the mission he said to see father sarria
i have not seen him yet
how about the sheep
the dogs will keep them in hand and i shall not be gone long
besides that i have a boy here to help
he is over yonder on the other side of the herd
we canot see him from here
presley wondered at the heedlessness of leaving the sheep so slightly guarded but made no comment and the two started off across the field in the direction of the mission church
well yes it is epic observed vanamee as they went along
but why write
why not in it
steep oneself in the heat of the desert the glory of the sunset the blue haze of the mesa and the canyon
as you have done for instance
vanamee nodded
no i could not do that declared presley want to go back but not so far as you
i feel that i must compromise
i must find expression
i could not lose myself like that in your desert
when its vastness overwhelmed me or its beauty dazzled me or its loneliness weighed down upon me i should have to record my impressions
otherwise i should suffocate
each to his own life observed vanamee
the mission of san juan built of brown dobe blocks covered with yellow plaster that at many points had dropped away from the walls stood on the crest of a low rise of the ground facing to the south
a covered colonnade paved with round worn bricks from whence opened the doors of the abandoned cells once used by the monks adjoined it on the left
the roof was of tiled halfcylinders split longitudinally and laid in alternate rows now concave now convex
the main body of the church itself was at right angles to the colonnade and at the point of intersection rose the belfry tower an ancient campanile where swung the three cracked bells the gift of the king of spain
beyond the church was the mission garden and the graveyard that overlooked the seed ranch in a little hollow beyond
presley and vanamee went down the long colonnade to the last door next the belfry tower and vanamee pulled the leather thong that hung from a hole in the door setting a little bell jangling somewhere in the interior
the place but for this noise was shrouded in a sunday stillness an absolute repose
only at intervals one heard the trickle of the unseen fountain and the liquid cooing of doves in the garden
father sarria opened the door
he was a small man somewhat stout with a smooth and shiny face
he wore a frock coat that was rather dirty slippers and an old yachting cap of blue cloth with a broken leather vizor
he was smoking a cheap cigar very fat and black
but instantly he recognised vanamee
his face went all alight with pleasure and astonishment
it seemed as if he would never have finished shaking both his hands and as it was he released but one of them patting him affectionately on the shoulder with the other
he was voluble in his welcome talking partly in spanish partly in english
so he had come back again this great fellow tanned as an indian lean as an indian with an long black hair
but he had not changed not in the very least
his beard had not grown an inch
aha
the rascal never to give warning to drop down as it were from out the sky
such a hermit
to live in the desert
a veritable saint jerome
did a lion feed him down there in arizona or was it a raven like elijah
the good god had not fattened him at any rate and apropos he was just about to dine himself
he had made a salad from his own lettuce
the two would dine with him eh
for this my son that was lost is found again
but presley excused himself
instinctively he felt that sarria and vanamee wanted to talk of things concerning which he was an outsider
it was not at all unlikely that vanamee would spend half the night before the high altar in the church
he took himself away his mind still busy with extraordinary life and character
but as he descended the hill he was startled by a prolonged and raucous cry discordant very harsh thrice repeated at exact intervals and looking up he saw one of father peacocks balancing himself upon the topmost wire of the fence his long tail trailing his neck outstretched filling the air with his stupid outcry for no reason than the desire to make a noise
about an hour later toward four in the afternoon presley reached the spring at the head of the little canyon in the northeast corner of the quien sabe ranch the point toward which he had been travelling since early in the forenoon
the place was not without its charm
innumerable liveoaks overhung the canyon and broderson a mere rivulet running down from the a certain coolness to the air
it was one of the few spots thereabouts that had survived the dry season of the last year
nearly all the other springs had dried completely while mission creek on ranch was nothing better than a dusty cutting in the ground filled with brittle concave flakes of dried and suncracked mud
presley climbed to the summit of one of the rose out of the canyon from the crest of which he could see for thirty fifty sixty miles down the valley and filling his pipe smoked lazily for upwards of an hour his head empty of thought allowing himself to succumb to a pleasant gentle inanition a little drowsy comfortable in his place prone upon the ground warmed just enough by such sunlight as filtered through the liveoaks soothed by the good tobacco and the prolonged murmur of the spring and creek
by degrees the sense of his own personality became blunted the little wheels and cogs of thought moved slower and slower consciousness dwindled to a point the animal in him stretched itself purring
a delightful numbness invaded his mind and his body
he was not asleep he was not awake stupefied merely lapsing back to the state of the faun the satyr
after a while rousing himself a little he shifted his position and drawing from the pocket of his shooting coat his little treecalf edition of the odyssey read far into the twentyfirst book where after the failure of all the suitors to bend bow it is finally put with mockery into his own hands
abruptly the drama of the story roused him from all his languor
in an instant he was the poet again his nerves tingling alive to every sensation responsive to every impression
the desire of creation of composition grew big within him
hexameters of his own clamoured tumultuous in his brain
not for a long time had he felt his poem as he called this sensation so poignantly
for an instant he told himself that he actually held it
it was no doubt talk that had stimulated him to this point
the story of the long trail with its desert and mountain its cliffdwellers its aztec ruins its colour movement and romance filled his mind with picture after picture
the epic defiled before his vision like a pageant
once more he shot a glance about him as if in search of the inspiration and this time he all but found it
he rose to his feet looking out and off below him
as from a pinnacle presley from where he now stood dominated the entire country
the sun had begun to set everything in the range of his vision was overlaid with a sheen of gold
first close at hand it was the seed ranch carpeting the little hollow behind the mission with a spread of greens some dark some vivid some pale almost to yellowness
beyond that was the mission itself its venerable campanile in whose arches hung the spanish bells already glowing ruddy in the sunset
farther on he could make out ranch house marked by the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well and a little farther to the east the huddled tiled roofs of guadalajara
far to the west and north he saw bonneville very plain and the dome of the courthouse a purple silhouette against the glare of the sky
other points detached themselves swimming in a golden mist projecting blue shadows far before them the mammoth liveoak by towering superb and magnificent the line of eucalyptus trees behind which he knew was the los muertos ranch home the wateringtank the great ironhooped tower of wood that stood at the joining of the lower road and the county road the long windbreak of poplar trees and the white walls of saloon on the county road
but all this seemed to be only foreground a mere array of mass of irrelevant details
beyond beyond guadalajara beyond the lower road beyond broderson creek on to the south and west infinite illimitable stretching out there under the sheen of the sunset forever and forever flat vast unbroken a huge scroll unrolling between the horizons spread the great stretches of the ranch of los muertos bare of crops shaved close in the recent harvest
near at hand were hills but on that far southern horizon only the curve of the great earth itself checked the view
adjoining los muertos and widening to the west opened the broderson ranch
the osterman ranch to the northwest carried on the great sweep of landscape ranch after ranch
then as the imagination itself expanded under the stimulus of that measureless range of vision even those great ranches resolved themselves into mere foreground mere accessories irrelevant details
beyond the fine line of the horizons over the curve of the globe the shoulder of the earth were other ranches equally vast and beyond these others and beyond these still others the immensities multiplying lengthening out vaster and vaster
the whole gigantic sweep of the san joaquin expanded titanic before the eye of the mind flagellated with heat quivering and shimmering under the suns red eye
at long intervals a faint breath of wind out of the south passed slowly over the levels of the baked and empty earth accentuating the silence marking off the stillness
it seemed to exhale from the land itself a prolonged sigh as of deep fatigue
it was the season after the harvest and the great earth the mother after its period of reproduction its pains of labour delivered of the fruit of its loins slept the sleep of exhaustion the infinite repose of the colossus benignant eternal strong the nourisher of nations the feeder of an entire world
ha there it was his epic his inspiration his west his thundering progression of hexameters
a sudden uplift a sense of exhilaration of physical exaltation appeared abruptly to sweep presley from his feet
as from a point high above the world he seemed to dominate a universe a whole order of things
he was dizzied stunned stupefied his morbid supersensitive mind reeling drunk with the intoxication of mere immensity
stupendous ideas for which there were no names drove headlong through his brain
terrible formless shapes vague figures gigantic monstrous distorted whirled at a gallop through his imagination
he started homeward still in his dream descending from the hill emerging from the canyon and took the short cut straight across the quien sabe ranch leaving guadalajara far to his left
he tramped steadily on through the wheat stubble walking fast his head in a whirl
never had he so nearly grasped his inspiration as at that moment on the hilltop
even now though the sunset was fading though the wide reach of valley was shut from sight it still kept him company
now the details came thronging component parts of his poem the signs and symbols of the west
it was there close at hand he had been in touch with it all day
it was in the centenarians vividly coloured la cuesta holding his grant from the spanish crown with his power of life and death the romance of his marriage the white horse with its pillion of red leather and silver bridle mountings the bullfights in the plaza the gifts of gold dust and horses and tallow
it was in strange history the tragedy of his love angele varian with her marvellous loveliness the egyptian fulness of her lips the perplexing upward slant of her violet eyes bizarre oriental her white forehead made three cornered by her plaits of gold hair the mystery of the other her death at the moment of her childs birth
it was in flight into the wilderness the story of the long trail the sunsets behind the altarlike mesas the baking desolation of the deserts the strenuous fierce life of forgotten towns down there far off lost below the horizons of the southwest the sonorous music of unfamiliar uintah sonora laredo uncompahgre
it was in the mission with its cracked bells its decaying walls its venerable sun dial its fountain and old garden and in the mission fathers themselves the priests the padres planting the first wheat and oil and wine to produce the elements of the trinity of great industries taking their rise in a religious rite
abruptly as if in confirmation presley heard the sound of a bell from the direction of the mission itself
it was the de profundis a note of the old world of the ancient regime an echo from the hillsides of mediaeval europe sounding there in this new land unfamiliar and strange at this time
by now however it was dark
presley hurried forward
he came to the line fence of the quien sabe ranch
everything was very still
the stars were all out
there was not a sound other than the de profundis still sounding from very far away
at long intervals the great earth sighed dreamily in its sleep
all about the feeling of absolute peace and quiet and security and untroubled happiness and content seemed descending from the stars like a benediction
the beauty of his poem its idyl came to him like a caress that alone had been lacking
it was that perhaps which had left it hitherto incomplete
at last he was to grasp his song in all its entity
but suddenly there was an interruption
presley had climbed the fence at the limit of the quien sabe ranch
beyond was los muertos but between the two ran the railroad
he had only time to jump back upon the embankment when with a quivering of all the earth a locomotive single unattached shot by him with a roar filling the air with the reek of hot oil vomiting smoke and sparks its enormous eye cyclopean red throwing a glare far in advance shooting by in a sudden crash of confused thunder filling the night with the terrific clamour of its iron hoofs
abruptly presley remembered
this must be the crack passenger engine of which dyke had told him the one delayed by the accident on the bakersfield division and for whose passage the track had been opened all the way to fresno
before presley could recover from the shock of the irruption while the earth was still vibrating the rails still humming the engine was far away flinging the echo of its frantic gallop over all the valley
for a brief instant it roared with a hollow diapason on the long trestle over broderson creek then plunged into a cutting farther on the quivering glare of its fires losing itself in the night its thunder abruptly diminishing to a subdued and distant humming
all at once this ceased
the engine was gone
but the moment the noise of the engine lapsed to start forward conscious of a confusion of lamentable sounds that rose into the night from out the engines wake
prolonged cries of agony sobbing wails of infinite pain heartrending pitiful
the noises came from a little distance
he ran down the track crossing the culvert over the irrigating ditch and at the head of the long reach of the culvert and the long abruptly held immovable at the sight of the ground and rails all about him
in some way the herd of found a breach in the wire fence by the right of way and had wandered out upon the tracks
a band had been crossing just at the moment of the engines passage
the pathos of it was beyond expression
it was a slaughter a massacre of innocents
the iron monster had charged full into the midst merciless inexorable
to the right and left all the width of the right of way the little bodies had been flung backs were snapped against the fence posts brains knocked out
caught in the barbs of the wire wedged in the bodies hung suspended
under foot it was terrible
the black blood winking in the starlight seeped down into the clinkers between the ties with a prolonged sucking murmur
presley turned away horrorstruck sick at heart overwhelmed with a quick burst of irresistible compassion for this brute agony he could not relieve
the sweetness was gone from the evening the sense of peace of security and placid contentment was stricken from the landscape
the hideous ruin in the engines path drove all thought of his poem from his mind
the inspiration vanished like a mist
the de profundis had ceased to ring
he hurried on across the los muertos ranch almost running even putting his hands over his ears till he was out of hearing distance of that all but human distress
not until he was beyond earshot did he pause looking back listening
the night had shut down again
for a moment the silence was profound unbroken
then faint and prolonged across the levels of the ranch he heard the engine whistling for bonneville
again and again at rapid intervals in its flying course it whistled for road crossings for sharp curves for trestles ominous notes hoarse bellowing ringing with the accents of menace and defiance and abruptly presley saw again in his imagination the galloping monster the terror of steel and steam with its single eye cyclopean red shooting from horizon to horizon but saw it now as the symbol of a vast power huge terrible flinging the echo of its thunder over all the reaches of the valley leaving blood and destruction in its path the leviathan with tentacles of steel clutching into the soil the soulless force the ironhearted power the monster the colossus the octopus
on the following morning harran derrick was up and about by a little after six oclock and a quarter of an hour later had breakfast in the kitchen of the ranch house preferring not to wait until the chinese cook laid the table in the regular diningroom
he scented a hard days work ahead of him and was anxious to be at it betimes
he was practically the manager of los muertos and with the aid of his foreman and three division superintendents carried forward nearly the entire direction of the ranch occupying himself with the details of his fathers plans executing his orders signing contracts paying bills and keeping the books
for the last three weeks little had been done
the as it been harvested and sold and there had been a general relaxation of activity for upwards of a month
now however the fall was coming on the dry season was about at its end any time after the twentieth of the month the first rains might be expected softening the ground putting it into condition for the plough
two days before this harran had notified his superintendents on three and four to send in such grain as they had reserved for seed
on two the wheat had not even shown itself above the ground while on one the home ranch which was under his own immediate supervision the seed had already been graded and selected
it was intention to commence bluestoning his seed that day a delicate and important process which prevented rust and smut appearing in the crop when the wheat should come up
but furthermore he wanted to find time to go to guadalajara to meet the governor on the morning train
his day promised to be busy
but as harran was finishing his last cup of coffee phelps the foreman on the home ranch who also looked after the storage barns where the seed was kept presented himself cap in hand on the back porch by the kitchen door thought speak to you about the seed from four sir he said
that hasnot been brought in yet
harran nodded see about it got all the bluestone you want have you phelps and without waiting for an answer he added tell the stableman i shall want the team about nine oclock to go to guadalajara
put them in the buggy
the bays you understand
when the other had gone harran drank off the rest of his coffee and rising passed through the diningroom and across a stonepaved hallway with a glass roof into the office just beyond
the office was the nervecentre of the entire ten thousand acres of los muertos but its appearance and furnishings were not in the least suggestive of a farm
it was divided at about its middle by a wire railing painted green and gold and behind this railing were the high desks where the books were kept the safe the letterpress and letterfiles and typewriting machine
a great map of los muertos with every watercourse depression and elevation together with indications of the varying depths of the clays and loams in the soil accurately plotted hung against the wall between the windows while near at hand by the safe was the telephone
but no doubt the most significant object in the office was the ticker
this was an innovation in the san joaquin an idea of shrewd quickwitted young annixter which harran and magnus derrick had been quick to adopt and after them broderson and osterman and many others of the wheat growers of the county
the offices of the ranches were thus connected by wire with san francisco and through that city with minneapolis duluth chicago new york and at last and most important of all with liverpool
fluctuations in the price of the worlds crop during and after the harvest thrilled straight to the office of los muertos to that of the quien sabe to and to during a flurry in the chicago wheat pits in the august of that year which had affected even the san francisco market harran and magnus had sat up nearly half of one night watching the strip of white tape jerking unsteadily from the reel
at such moments they no longer felt their individuality
the ranch became merely the part of an enormous whole a unit in the vast agglomeration of wheat land the whole world round feeling the effects of causes thousands of miles drought on the prairies of dakota a rain on the plains of india a frost on the russian steppes a hot wind on the llanos of the argentine
harran crossed over to the telephone and rang six bells the call for the division house on four
it was the most distant the most isolated point on all the ranch situated at its far southeastern extremity where few people ever went close to the line fence a dot a speck lost in the immensity of the open country
by the road it was eleven miles distant from the office and by the trail to and the lower road all of nine
how about that seed demanded harran when he had got cutter on the line
the other made excuses for an unavoidable delay and was adding that he was on the point of starting out when harran cut in with you had better go the trail
it will save a little time and i am in a hurry
put your sacks on the horses backs
and cutter if you see hooven when you go by his place tell him i want him and by the way take a look at the end of the irrigating ditch when you get to it
see how they are getting along there and if billy wants anything
tell him we are expecting those new scoops down tomorrow or next day and to get along with what he has until then everything on four
all right then
give your seed to phelps when you get here if i am not about
i am going to guadalajara to meet the governor coming down today
and that makes me think we lost the case you know
i had a letter from the governor yesterday
yes hard luck
behrman did us up
well goodbye and donot lose any time with that seed
i want to bluestone today
after telephoning cutter harran put on his hat went over to the barns and found phelps
phelps had already cleaned out the vat which was to contain the solution of bluestone and was now at work regrading the seed
against the wall behind him ranged the row of sacks
harran cut the fastenings of these and examined the contents carefully taking handfuls of wheat from each and allowing it to run through his fingers or nipping the grains between his nails testing their hardness
the seed was all of the white varieties of wheat and of a very high grade the berries hard and heavy rigid and swollen with starch
if it was all like that sir hey observed phelps
harran put his chin in the air
bread would be as good as cake then he answered going from sack to sack inspecting the contents and consulting the tags affixed to the mouths
hello he remarked a red wheat
where did this come from that red clawson we sowed to the piece on four north the mission creek just to see how it would do here
we didnot get a very good catch
we canot do better than to stay by white sonora and propo remarked harran got our best results with that and european millers like it to mix with the eastern wheats that have more gluten than ours
that is if we have any wheat at all next year
a feeling of discouragement for the moment bore down heavily upon him
at intervals this came to him and for the moment it was overpowering
the idea of whatstheuse was upon occasion a veritable oppression
everything seemed to combine to lower the price of wheat
the extension of wheat areas always exceeded increase of population competition was growing fiercer every year
the farmers profits were the object of attack from a score of different quarters
it was a flock of vultures descending upon a common commission merchant the elevator combine the mixinghouse ring the banks the warehouse men the labouring man and above all the railroad
steadily the liverpool buyers cut and cut and cut
everything every element of the worlds markets tended to force down the price to the lowest possible figure at which it could be profitably farmed
now it was down to eightyseven
it was at that figure the crop had sold that year and to think that the governor had seen wheat at two dollars and five cents in the year of the turkorussian war
he turned back to the house after giving phelps final directions gloomy disheartened his hands deep in his pockets wondering what was to be the outcome
so narrow had the margin of profit shrunk that a dry season meant bankruptcy to the smaller farmers throughout all the valley
he knew very well how widespread had been the distress the last two years
with their own tenants on los muertos affairs had reached the stage of desperation
derrick had practically been obliged to carry hooven and some of the others
the governor himself had made almost nothing during the last season a third year like the last with the price steadily sagging meant nothing else but ruin
but here he checked himself
two consecutive dry seasons in california were almost unprecedented a third would be beyond belief and the complete rest for nearly all the land was a compensation
they had made no money that was true but they had lost none
thank god the homestead was free of mortgage one good season would more than make up the difference
he was in a better mood by the time he reached the driveway that led up to the ranch house and as he raised his eyes toward the house itself he could not but feel that the sight of his home was cheering
the ranch house was set in a great grove of eucalyptus oak and cypress enormous trees growing from out a lawn that was as green as fresh and as wellgroomed as any in a garden in the city
this lawn flanked all one side of the house and it was on this side that the family elected to spend most of its time
the other side looking out upon the home ranch toward bonneville and the railroad was but little used
a deep porch ran the whole length of the house here and in the lower branches of a liveoak near the steps harran had built a little summer house for his mother
to the left of the ranch house itself toward the county road was the bunkhouse and kitchen for some of the hands
from the steps of the porch the view to the southward expanded to infinity
there was not so much as a twig to obstruct the view
in one leap the eye reached the fine delicate line where earth and sky met miles away
the flat monotony of the land clean of fencing was broken by one spot only the roof of the division house on mere speck just darker than the ground house on four was not even in sight
that was below the horizon
as harran came up he saw his mother at breakfast
the table had been set on the porch and mrs derrick stirring her coffee with one hand held open with the other the pages of walter marius
at her feet princess nathalie the white angora cat sleek overfed selfcentred sat on her haunches industriously licking at the white fur of her breast while near at hand by the railing of the porch presley pottered with a new bicycle lamp filling it with oil adjusting the wicks
harran kissed his mother and sat down in a wicker chair on the porch removing his hat running his fingers through his yellow hair
magnus wife looked hardly old enough to be the mother of two such big fellows as harran and lyman derrick
she was not far into the fifties and her brown hair still retained much of its brightness
she could yet be called pretty
her eyes were large and easily assumed a look of inquiry and innocence such as one might expect to see in a young girl
by disposition she was retiring she easily obliterated herself
she was not made for the harshness of the world and yet she had known these harshnesses in her younger days
magnus had married her when she was twentyone years old at a time when she was a graduate of some years standing from the state normal school and was teaching literature music and penmanship in a seminary in the town of marysville
she overworked herself here continually loathing the strain of teaching yet clinging to it with a tenacity born of the knowledge that it was her only means of support
both her parents were dead she was dependent upon herself
her one ambition was to see italy and the bay of naples
the marble faun madonnas and il trovatore were her beau ideals of literature and art she dreamed of italy rome naples and the worlds great artcentres
there was no doubt that her affair with magnus had been a lovematch but annie payne would have loved any man who would have taken her out of the droning heartbreaking routine of the class and music room
she had followed his fortunes unquestioningly
first at sacramento during the turmoil of his political career later on at placerville in el dorado county after derrick had interested himself in the corpus christi group of mines and finally at los muertos where after selling out his fourth interest in corpus christi he had turned rancher and had come in on the new tracts of wheat land just thrown open by the railroad
she had lived here now for nearly ten years
but never for one moment since the time her glance first lost itself in the unbroken immensity of the ranches had she known a moments content
continually there came into her pretty wideopen eyes of a young look of uneasiness of distrust and aversion
los muertos frightened her
she remembered the days of her young girlhood passed on a farm in eastern hundred acres neatly partitioned into the water lot the cow pasture the corn lot the barley field and wheat farm cosey comfortable homelike where the farmers loved their land caressing it coaxing it nourishing it as though it were a thing almost conscious where the seed was sown by hand and a single twohorse plough was sufficient for the entire farm where the scythe sufficed to cut the harvest and the grain was thrashed with flails
but this new order of ranch bounded only by the horizons where as far as one could see to the north to the east to the south and to the west was all one holding a principality ruled with iron and steam bullied into a yield of three hundred and fifty thousand bushels where even when the land was resting unploughed unharrowed and unsown the wheat came her and even at times filled her with an undefinable terror
to her mind there was something inordinate about it all something almost unnatural
the direct brutality of ten thousand acres of wheat nothing but wheat as far as the eye could see stunned her a little
the onetime writingteacher of a young ladies seminary with her pretty deerlike eyes and delicate fingers shrank from it
she did not want to look at so much wheat
there was something vaguely indecent in the sight this food of the people this elemental force this basic energy weltering here under the sun in all the unconscious nakedness of a sprawling primordial titan
the monotony of the ranch ate into her heart hour by hour year by year
and with it all when was she to see rome italy and the bay of naples
it was a different prospect truly
magnus had given her his promise that once the ranch was well established they two should travel
but continually he had been obliged to put her off now for one reason now for another the machine would not as yet run of itself he must still feel his hand upon the lever next year perhaps when wheat should go to ninety or the rains were good
she did not insist
she obliterated herself only allowing from time to time her pretty questioning eyes to meet his
in the meantime she retired within herself
she surrounded herself with books
her taste was of the delicacy of point lace
she knew her austin dobson by heart
she read poems essays the ideas of the seminary at marysville persisting in her mind
marius the epicurean the essays of elia sesame and lilies the stones of venice and the little toy magazines full of the flaccid banalities of the minor poets were continually in her hands
when presley had appeared on los muertos she had welcomed his arrival with delight
here at last was a congenial spirit
she looked forward to long conversations with the young man on literature art and ethics
but presley had disappointed her
that of his few chosen care little for literature shocked her beyond words
his indifference to style to elegant english was a positive affront
his savage abuse and open ridicule of the neatly phrased rondeaux and sestinas and chansonettes of the little magazines was to her mind a wanton and uncalledfor cruelty
she found his homer with its slaughters and hecatombs and barbaric feastings and headstrong passions violent and coarse
she could not see with him any romance any poetry in the life around her she looked to italy for that
his song of the west which only once incoherent and fierce he had tried to explain to her its swift tumultous life its truth its nobility and savagery its heroism and obscenity had revolted her
but presley she had murmured that is not literature
no he had cried between his teeth no thank god it is not
a little later one of the stablemen brought the buggy with the team of bays up to the steps of the porch and harran putting on a different coat and a black hat took himself off to guadalajara
the morning was fine there was no cloud in the sky but as buggy drew away from the grove of trees about the ranch house emerging into the open country on either side of the lower road he caught himself looking sharply at the sky and the faint line of hills beyond the quien sabe ranch
there was a certain indefinite cast to the landscape that to eye was not to be mistaken
rain the first of the season was not far off good he muttered touching the bays with the whip we canot get our ploughs to hand any too soon
these ploughs magnus derrick had ordered from an eastern manufacturer some months before since he was dissatisfied with the results obtained from the ones he had used hitherto which were of local make
however there had been exasperating and unexpected delays in their shipment
magnus and harran both had counted upon having the ploughs in their implement barns that very week but a tracer sent after them had only resulted in locating them still en route somewhere between the needles and bakersfield
now there was likelihood of rain within the week
ploughing could be undertaken immediately afterward so soon as the ground was softened but there was a fair chance that the ranch would lie idle for want of proper machinery
it was ten minutes before train time when harran reached the depot at guadalajara
the san francisco papers of the preceding day had arrived on an earlier train
he bought a couple from the station agent and looked them over till a distant and prolonged whistle announced the approach of the down train
in one of the four passengers that alighted from the train he recognised his father
he half rose in his seat whistling shrilly between his teeth waving his hand and magnus derrick catching sight of him came forward quickly all of six feet tall and though now well toward his sixtieth year was as erect as an officer of cavalry
he was broad in proportion a fine commanding figure imposing an immediate respect impressing one with a sense of gravity of dignity and a certain pride of race
he was smoothshaven thinlipped with a broad chin and a prominent hawklike characteristic of the familythin with a high bridge such as one sees in the later portraits of the duke of wellington
his hair was thick and irongrey and had a tendency to curl in a forward direction just in front of his ears
he wore a tophat of grey with a wide brim and a frock coat and carried a cane with a yellowed ivory head
as a young man it had been his ambition to represent his native the united states senate
calhoun was his great man but in two successive campaigns he had been defeated
his career checked in this direction he had come to california in the fifties
he had known and had been the intimate friend of such men as terry broderick general baker lick alvarado emerich larkin and above all of the unfortunate and misunderstood ralston
once he had been put forward as the democratic candidate for governor but failed of election
after this magnus had definitely abandoned politics and had invested all his money in the corpus christi mines
then he had sold out his interest at a small in time to miss his chance of becoming a multimillionaire in the comstock was looking for reinvestments in other lines when the news that wheat had been discovered in california was passed from mouth to mouth
practically it amounted to a discovery
dr first harvest of wheat in colusa county quietly undertaken but suddenly realised with dramatic abruptness gave a new matter for reflection to the thinking men of the new west
california suddenly leaped unheralded into the worlds market as a competitor in wheat production
in a few years her output of wheat exceeded the value of her output of gold and when later on the pacific and southwestern railroad threw open to settlers the rich lands of tulare to the corporation by the government as a bonus for the construction of the had been quick to seize the opportunity and had taken up the ten thousand acres of los muertos
wherever he had gone magnus had taken his family with him
lyman had been born at sacramento during the turmoil and excitement of campaign for governor and harran at shingle springs in el dorado county six years later
but magnus was in every sense the prominent man
in whatever circle he moved he was the chief figure
instinctively other men looked to him as the leader
he himself was proud of this distinction he assumed the grand manner very easily and carried it well
as a public speaker he was one of the last of the followers of the old school of orators
he even carried the diction and manner of the rostrum into private life
it was said of him that his most colloquial conversation could be taken down in shorthand and read off as an admirable specimen of pure wellchosen english
he loved to do things upon a grand scale to preside to dominate
in his good humour there was something jovian
when angry everybody around him trembled
but he had not the genius for detail was not patient
the certain grandiose lavishness of his disposition occupied itself more with results than with means
he was always ready to take chances to hazard everything on the hopes of colossal returns
in the mining days at placerville there was no more redoubtable poker player in the county
he had been as lucky in his mines as in his gambling sinking shafts and tunnelling in violation of expert theory and finding pay in every case
without knowing it he allowed himself to work his ranch much as if he was still working his mine
the oldtime spirit of haphazard unscientific persisted in his mind
everything was a took the greatest chances was most apt to be the greatest winner
the idea of manuring los muertos of husbanding his great resources he would have scouted as niggardly hebraic ungenerous
magnus climbed into the buggy helping himself with outstretched hand which he still held
the two were immensely fond of each other proud of each other
they were constantly together and magnus kept no secrets from his favourite son
well boy
well governor am very pleased you came yourself harran
i feared that you might be too busy and send phelps
it was thoughtful
harran was about to reply but at that moment magnus caught sight of the three flat cars loaded with brightpainted farming machines which still remained on the siding above the station
he laid his hands on the reins and harran checked the team
harran observed magnus fixing the machinery with a judicial frown harran those look singularly like our ploughs
drive over boy
the train had by this time gone on its way and harran brought the team up to the siding
ah i was right said the governor
derrick los muertos bonneville from ditson co rochester
these are ours boy
harran breathed a sigh of relief
at last he answered and just in time too have rain before the week is out
i think now that i am here i will telephone phelps to send the wagon right down for these
i started bluestoning today
magnus nodded a grave approval
that was shrewd boy
as to the rain i think you are well informed we will have an early season
the ploughs have arrived at a happy moment
it means money to us governor remarked harran
but as he turned the horses to allow his father to get into the buggy again the two were surprised to hear a thick throaty voice wishing them goodmorning and turning about were aware of behrman who had come up while they were examining the ploughs eyes flashed on the instant and through his nostrils he drew a sharp quick breath while a certain rigour of carriage stiffened the set of magnus shoulders and back
magnus had not yet got into the buggy but stood with the team between him and behrman eyeing him calmly across the horses backs
behrman came around to the other side of the buggy and faced magnus
he was a large fat man with a great stomach his cheek and the upper part of his thick neck ran together to form a great tremulous jowl shaven and bluegrey in colour a roll of fat sprinkled with sparse hair moist with perspiration protruded over the back of his collar
he wore a heavy black moustache
on his head was a roundtopped hat of stiff brown straw highly varnished
a lightbrown linen vest stamped with innumerable interlocked horseshoes covered his protuberant stomach upon which a heavy watch chain of hollow links rose and fell with his difficult breathing clinking against the vest buttons of imitation motherofpearl
behrman was the banker of bonneville
but besides this he was many other things
he was a real estate agent
he bought grain he dealt in mortgages
he was one of the local political bosses but more important than all this he was the representative of the pacific and southwestern railroad in that section of tulare county
the railroad did little business in that part of the country that behrman did not supervise from the consignment of a shipment of wheat to the management of a damage suit or even to the repair and maintenance of the right of way
during the time when the ranchers of the county were fighting the grainrate case behrman had been much in evidence in and about the san francisco court rooms and the lobby of the legislature in sacramento
he had returned to bonneville only recently a decision adverse to the ranchers being foreseen
the position he occupied on the salary list of the pacific and southwestern could not readily be defined for he was neither freight agent passenger agent attorney realestate broker nor political servant though his influence in all these offices was undoubted and enormous
but for all that the ranchers about bonneville knew whom to look to as a source of trouble
there was no denying the fact that for osterman broderson annixter and derrick behrman was the railroad
mr derrick goodmorning he cried as he came up
harran
glad to see you back mr derrick
he held out a thick hand
magnus head and shoulders above the other tall thin erect looked down upon behrman inclining his head failing to see his extended hand sir he observed and waited for further speech
well mr derrick continued behrman wiping the back of his neck with his handkerchief saw in the city papers yesterday that our case had gone against you guess it wasnot any great news to commented harran his face scarlet guess you knew which way ulsteen was going to jump after your very first interview with him
you donot like to be surprised in this sort of thing behrman
now you know better than that harran remonstrated behrman blandly know what you mean to imply but i ainot going to let it make me get mad
i wanted to say to your wanted to say to you mr one man to alone for the minute that we were on opposite sides of the sorry you didnot win
your side made a good fight but it was in a mistaken cause the whole trouble
why you could have figured out before you ever went into the case that such rates are confiscation of property
you must allow allow the fair interest on the investment
you donot want us to go into the receivers hands do you now mr derrick
the board of railroad commissioners was bought remarked magnus sharply a keen brisk flash glinting in his eye
it was part of the game put in harran for the railroad commission to cut rates to a ridiculous figure far below a figure just so that it be confiscation
whether ulsteen is a tool of yours or not he had to put the rates back to what they were originally
if you enforced those rates mr harran returned behrman calmly we wouldnot be able to earn sufficient money to meet operating expenses or fixed charges to say nothing of a surplus left over to pay dividends tell me when the and ever paid dividends
the lowest rates continued behrman that the legislature can establish must be such as will secure us a fair interest on our investment
well whats your standard
come lets hear it
who is to say whats a fair rate
the railroad has its own notions of fairness sometimes
the laws of the state returned behrman fix the rate of interest at seven per cent a good enough standard for us
there is no reason mr harran why a dollar invested in a railroad should not earn as much as a dollar represented by a promissory per cent
by applying your schedule of rates we would not earn a cent we would be bankrupt
interest on your investment cried harran furious fine to talk about fair interest
i know and you know that the total earnings of the and main branch and leased lines for last between nineteen and twenty millions of dollars
do you mean to say that twenty million dollars is seven per cent of the original cost of the road
behrman spread out his hands smiling
that was the gross not the net how can you tell what was the original cost of the road
ah thats just it shouted harran emphasising each word with a blow of his fist upon his knee his eyes sparkling you take cursed good care that we donot know anything about the original cost of the road
but we know you are bonded for treble your value and we know this that the road have been built for fiftyfour thousand dollars per mile and that you it cost you eightyseven thousand
it makes a difference behrman on which of these two figures you are basing your seven per cent
that all may show obstinacy harran observed behrman vaguely but it donot show common sense
we are threshing out old straw i believe gentlemen remarked magnus
the question was thoroughly sifted in the courts
quite right assented behrman
the best way is that the railroad and the farmer understand each other and get along peaceably
we are both dependent on each other
your ploughs i believe mr derrick
behrman nodded toward the flat cars
they are consigned to me admitted magnus
it looks a trifle like rain observed behrman easing his neck and jowl in his limp collar suppose you will want to begin ploughing next week
possibly said magnus see that your ploughs are hurried through for you then mr derrick
we will route them by fast freight for you and it wonot cost you anything extra
what do you mean demanded harran
the ploughs are here
we have nothing more to do with the railroad
i am going to have my wagons down here this afternoon am sorry answered behrman but the cars are going north not as you thought coming the north
they have not been to san francisco yet
magnus made a slight movement of the head as one who remembers a fact hitherto forgotten
but harran was as yet unenlightened
to san francisco he answered we want them are you talking about
well you know of course the regulations answered behrman
freight of this kind coming from the eastern points into the state must go first to one of our common points and be reshipped from there
harran did remember now but never before had the matter so struck home
he leaned back in his seat in dumb amazement for the instant
even magnus had turned a little pale
then abruptly harran broke out violent and raging
what next
my god why donot you break into our houses at night
why donot you steal the watch out of my pocket steal the horses out of the harness hold us up with a shotgun yes stand and deliver your money or your life
here we bring our ploughs from the east over your lines but youre not content with your longhaul rate between eastern points and bonneville
you want to get us under your ruinous shorthaul rate between bonneville and san francisco think of it a load of stuff for bonneville that canot stop at bonneville where it is consigned but has got to go up to san francisco first bonneville at forty cents per ton and then be reshipped from san francisco back to bonneville again at cents per ton the shorthaul rate
and we have to pay it all or go without
here are the ploughs right here in sight of the land they have got to be used on the season just ready for them and we canot touch them
oh he exclaimed in deep disgust it a pretty mess it a farce the whole dirty business
behrman listened to him unmoved his little eyes blinking under his fat forehead the gold chain of hollow links clicking against the pearl buttons of his waistcoat as he breathed
it donot do any good to let loose like that harran he said at length am willing to do what i can for you hurry the ploughs through but i canot change the freight regulation of the road your blackmail for this vociferated harran
how much do you want to let us go
how much have we got to pay you to be to use our own your figure
come spit it out see you are trying to make me angry harran returned behrman but you wonot succeed
better give up trying my boy
as i said the best way is to have the railroad and the farmer get along amicably
it is the only way we can do business
well slong governor i must trot along
harran
he took himself off
but before leaving guadalajara magnus dropped into the towns small grocery store to purchase a box of cigars of a certain mexican brand unprocurable elsewhere
harran remained in the buggy
while he waited dyke appeared at the end of the street and seeing younger son came over to shake hands with him
he explained his affair with the and and asked the young man what he thought of the expected rise in the price of hops
hops ought to be a good thing harran told him
the crop in germany and in new york has been a dead failure for the last three years and so many people have gone out of the business that theres likely to be a shortage and a stiff advance in the price
they ought to go to a dollar next year
sure hops ought to be a good thing the old lady and sidney dyke
why fairly well thank you harran up to sacramento just now to see my brother
i was thinking of going in with my brother into this hop business
but i had a letter from him this morning
he may not be able to meet me on this proposition got other business on hand
if he pulls he probably have to go it alone but have to borrow
i had thought with his money and mine we would have enough to pull off the affair without mortgaging anything
as it is i guess have to see behrman be cursed if i would exclaimed harran
well behrman is a screw admitted the engineer and he is railroad to his boots but business is business and he would have to stand by a contract in black and white and this chance in hops is too good to let slide
i guess well try it on harran
i can get a good foreman that knows all about hops just now and if the deal payswell i want to send sid to a seminary up in san francisco
well mortgage the crops but donot mortgage the homestead dyke said harran
and by the way have you looked up the freight rates on hops
no i havenot yet answered dyke and i had better be sure of that hadnot i hear that the rate is reasonable though
you be sure to have a clear understanding with the railroad first about the rate harran warned him
when magnus came out of the grocery store and once more seated himself in the buggy he said to harran boy drive over here to before we start home
i want to ask him to dine with us tonight
osterman and broderson are to drop in i believe and i should like to have annixter as well
magnus was lavishly hospitable
los doors invariably stood open to all the derricks neighbours and once in so often magnus had a few of his intimates to dinner
as harran and his father drove along the road toward ranch house magnus asked about what had happened during his absence
he inquired after his wife and the ranch commenting upon the work on the irrigating ditch
harran gave him the news of the past week discharge his resolve to raise a crop of hops return the killing of the sheep and petition to remain upon the ranch as tenant
it needed only recommendation that the german should remain to have magnus consent upon the instant
you know more about it than boy he said and whatever you think is wise shall be done
harran touched the bays with the whip urging them to their briskest pace
they were not yet at and he was anxious to get back to the ranch house to supervise the bluestoning of his seed
by the way governor he demanded suddenly how is lyman getting on
lyman eldest son had never taken kindly toward ranch life
he resembled his mother more than he did magnus and had inherited from her a distaste for agriculture and a tendency toward a profession
at a time when harran was learning the rudiments of farming lyman was entering the state university and graduating thence had spent three years in the study of law
but later on traits that were particularly his fathers developed
politics interested him
he told himself he was a born politician was diplomatic approachable had a talent for intrigue a gift of making friends easily and most indispensable of all a veritable genius for putting influential men under obligations to himself
already he had succeeded in gaining for himself two important offices in the municipal administration of san he had his attorney and later on assistant district attorney
but with these small achievements he was by no means satisfied
the largeness of his fathers character modified in lyman by a counterinfluence of selfishness had produced in him an inordinate ambition
where his father during his political career had considered himself only as an exponent of principles he strove to apply lyman saw but the office his own personal aggrandisement
he belonged to the new school wherein objects were attained not by orations before senates and assemblies but by sessions of committees caucuses compromises and expedients
his goal was to be in fact what magnus was only in namegovernor
lyman with shut teeth had resolved that some day he would sit in the gubernatorial chair in sacramento
lyman is doing well answered magnus could wish he was more pronounced in his convictions less willing to compromise but i believe him to be earnest and to have a talent for government and civics
his ambition does him credit and if he occupied himself a little more with means and a little less with ends he would i am sure be the ideal servant of the people
but i am not afraid
the time will come when the state will be proud of him
as harran turned the team into the driveway that led up to house magnus remarked harran isnot that young annixter himself on the porch
harran nodded and remarked by the way governor i wouldnot seem too cordial in your invitation to annixter
he will be glad to come i know but if you seem to want him too much it is just like his confounded obstinacy to make objections
there is something in that observed magnus as harran drew up at the porch of the house
he is a queer crossgrained fellow but in many ways sterling
annixter was lying in the hammock on the porch precisely as presley had found him the day before reading david copperfield and stuffing himself with dried prunes
when he recognised magnus however he got up though careful to give evidence of the most poignant discomfort
he explained his difficulty at great length protesting that his stomach was no better than a spongebag
would magnus and harran get down and have a drink
there was whiskey somewhere about
magnus however declined
he stated his errand asking annixter to come over to los muertos that evening for seven oclock dinner
osterman and broderson would be there
at once annixter even to surprise put his chin in the air making excuses fearing to compromise himself if he accepted too readily
no he did not think he could get sure of it in fact
there were certain businesses he had on hand that evening
he had practically made an appointment with a man at bonneville then too he was thinking of going up to san francisco tomorrow and needed his sleep would go to bed early and besides all that he was a very sick man his stomach was out of whack if he moved about it brought the gripes back
no they must get along without him
magnus knowing with whom he had to deal did not urge the point being convinced that annixter would argue over the affair the rest of the morning
he resettled himself in the buggy and harran gathered up the reins
well he observed you know your business best
come if you can
we dine at seven hear you are going to farm the whole of los muertos this season remarked annixter with a certain note of challenge in his voice
we are thinking of it replied magnus
annixter grunted scornfully
did you get the message i sent you by presley he began
tactless blunt and direct annixter was quite capable of calling even magnus a fool to his face
but before he could proceed behrman in his single buggy turned into the gate and driving leisurely up to the porch halted on the other side of team gentlemen he remarked nodding to the two derricks as though he had not seen them earlier in the day
mr annixter how do you do
what in hell do want demanded annixter with a stare
behrman hiccoughed slightly and passed a fat hand over his waistcoat
why not very much mr annixter he replied ignoring the belligerency in the young ranchmans voice but i will have to lodge a protest against you mr annixter in the matter of keeping your line fence in repair
the sheep were all over the track last night this side the long trestle and i am afraid they have seriously disturbed our ballast along there fence along our right of way
the farmers have the prescriptive right of that so we have to look to you to keep your fence in repair
i am sorry but i shall have to protest annixter returned to the hammock and stretched himself out in it to his full length remarking tranquilly go to the devil
it is as much to your interest as to ours that the safety of the public you heard what i said
go to the devil
that all may show obstinacy mr annixter but suddenly annixter jumped up again and came to the edge of the porch his face flamed scarlet to the roots of his stiff yellow hair
he thrust out his jaw aggressively clenching his teeth
you he vociferated tell you what you are
to his mind it was the last insult the most outrageous calumny
he had no worse epithet at his command show obstinacy pursued behrman bent upon finishing the phrase but it donot show common sense mend my fence and then again maybe i wonot mend my fence shouted annixter know what you wild engine last night
well youve no right to run at that speed in the town limits
how the town limits
the sheep were this side the long trestle
well thats in the town limits of guadalajara
why mr annixter the long trestle is a good two miles out of guadalajara
annixter squared himself leaping to the chance of an argument
two miles not a mile and a quarter
no its not a mile leave it to magnus here
oh i know nothing about it declared magnus refusing to be involved
yes you do
yes you do too
any fool knows how far it is from guadalajara to the long trestle about fiveeighths of a mile
from the depot of the town remarked behrman placidly to the head of the long trestle is about two miles a lie and you know its a lie shouted the other furious at calmness and i can prove its a lie walked that distance on the upper road and i know just how fast i walk and if i can walk four miles in one hour
magnus and harran drove on leaving annixter trying to draw behrman into a wrangle
when at length behrman as well took himself away annixter returned to his hammock finished the rest of his prunes and read another chapter of copperfield
then he put the book open over his face and went to sleep
an hour later toward noon his own terrific snoring woke him up suddenly and he sat up rubbing his face and blinking at the sunlight
there was a bad taste in his mouth from sleeping with it wide open and going into the diningroom of the house he mixed himself a drink of whiskey and soda and swallowed it in three great gulps
he told himself that he felt not only better but hungry and pressed an electric button in the wall near the sideboard three times to let the in a separate building near the ranch that he was ready for his dinner
as he did so an idea occurred to him
he wondered if hilma tree would bring up his dinner and wait on the table while he ate it
in connection with his ranch annixter ran a dairy farm on a very small scale making just enough butter and cheese for the consumption of the ranchs old man tree his wife and his daughter hilma looked after the dairy
but there was not always work enough to keep the three of them occupied and hilma at times made herself useful in other ways
as often as not she lent a hand in the kitchen and two or three times a week she took her mothers place in looking after house making the beds putting his room to rights bringing his meals up from the kitchen
for the last summer she had been away visiting with relatives in one of the towns on the coast
but the week previous to this she had returned and annixter had come upon her suddenly one day in the dairy making cheese the sleeves of her crisp blue shirt waist rolled back to her very shoulders
annixter had carried away with him a clearcut recollection of these smooth white arms of hers bare to the shoulder very round and cool and fresh
he would not have believed that a girl so young should have had arms so big and perfect
to his surprise he found himself thinking of her after he had gone to bed that night and in the morning when he woke he was bothered to know whether he had dreamed about fine white arms over night
then abruptly he had lost patience with himself for being so occupied with the subject raging and furious with all the breed of fine way for a man to waste his time
he had had his experience with the timid little creature in the glovecleaning establishment in sacramento
that was enough
feemales
rot
none of them in thank you had seen hilma tree give him a look in the dairy
aha he saw through her
she was trying to get a hold on him was she
he would show her
wait till he saw her again
he would send her about her business in a hurry
he resolved upon a terrible demeanour in the presence of the dairy great show of indifference a fierce masculine nonchalance and when the next morning she brought him his breakfast he had been smitten dumb as soon as she entered the room glueing his eyes upon his plate his elbows close to his side awkward clumsy overwhelmed with constraint
while true to his convictions as a womanhater and genuinely despising hilma both as a girl and as an inferior the idea of her worried him
most of all he was angry with himself because of his inane sheepishness when she was about
he at first had told himself that he was a fool not to be able to ignore her existence as hitherto and then that he was a greater fool not to take advantage of his position
certainly he had not the remotest idea of any affection but hilma was a fine looking girl
he imagined an affair with her
as he reflected upon the matter now scowling abstractedly at the button of the electric bell turning the whole business over in his mind he remembered that today was buttermaking day and that mrs tree would be occupied in the dairy
that meant that hilma would take her place
he turned to the mirror of the sideboard scrutinising his reflection with grim disfavour
after a moment rubbing the roughened surface of his chin the wrong way he muttered to his image in the glass that a mug
good lord what a looking mug
then after a moments silence wonder if that fool feemale will be up here today
he crossed over into his bedroom and peeped around the edge of the lowered curtain
the window looked out upon the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well and the cookhouse and dairyhouse close beside it
as he watched he saw hilma come out from the cookhouse and hurry across toward the kitchen
evidently she was going to see about his dinner
but as she passed by the artesian well she met young delaney one of hands coming up the trail by the irrigating ditch leading his horse toward the stables a great coil of barbed wire in his gloved hands and a pair of nippers thrust into his belt
no doubt he had been mending the break in the line fence by the long trestle
annixter saw him take off his widebrimmed hat as he met hilma and the two stood there for some moments talking together
annixter even heard hilma laughing very gayly at something delaney was saying
she patted his horses neck affectionately and delaney drawing the nippers from his belt made as if to pinch her arm with them
she caught at his wrist and pushed him away laughing again
to mind the pair seemed astonishingly intimate
brusquely his anger flamed up
ah that was it was it
delaney and hilma had an understanding between themselves
they carried on their affair right out there in the open under his very eyes
it was absolutely disgusting
had they no sense of decency those two
well this ended it
he would stop that sort of thing short off none of that on ranch if he knew it
no sir
he would pack that girl off before he was a day older
he wouldnot have that kind about the place
not much have to get out
he would talk to old man tree about it this afternoon
whatever happened insisted upon morality
and my dinner he suddenly exclaimed got to wait and go maybe get sick they carry on their disgusting lovemaking
he turned about on the instant and striding over to the electric bell rang it again with all his might
when that feemale gets up here he declared just find out why got to wait like this take her down to the taste lenient enough lord knows but i donot propose to be imposed upon the time
a few moments later while annixter was pretending to read the county newspaper by the window in the diningroom hilma came in to set the table
at the time annixter had his feet cocked on the window ledge and was smoking a cigar but as soon as she entered the room his feet down to the floor and crushed out the lighted tip of his cigar under the window ledge
over the top of the paper he glanced at her covertly from time to time
though hilma was only nineteen years old she was a large girl with all the development of a much older woman
there was a certain generous amplitude to the full round curves of her hips and shoulders that suggested the precocious maturity of a healthy vigorous animal life passed under the hot southern sun of a halftropical country
she was one knew at a glance warmblooded fullblooded with an even comfortable balance of temperament
her neck was thick and sloped to her shoulders with full beautiful curves and under her chin and under her ears the flesh was as white and smooth as floss satin shading exquisitely to a faint delicate brown on her nape at the roots of her hair
her throat rounded to meet her chin and cheek with a soft swell of the skin tinted pale amber in the shadows but blending by barely perceptible gradations to the sweet warm flush of her cheek
this colour on her temples was just touched with a certain blueness where the flesh was thin over the fine veining underneath
her eyes were light brown and so wide open that on the slightest provocation the full disc of the pupil was disclosed the a fraction of a shade darker than the hue of her edged with lashes that were almost black
while these lashes were not long they were thick and rimmed her eyes with a fine thin line
her mouth was rather large the lips shut tight and nothing could have been more graceful more charming than the outline of these full lips of hers and her round white chin modulating downward with a certain delicious roundness to her neck her throat and the sweet feminine amplitude of her breast
the slightest movement of her head and shoulders sent a gentle undulation through all this beauty of soft outlines and smooth surfaces the delicate amber shadows deepening or fading or losing themselves imperceptibly in the pretty rosecolour of her cheeks or the dark warmtinted shadow of her thick brown hair
her hair seemed almost to have a life of its own almost thick glossy and moist lying in heavy sweetsmelling masses over her forehead over her small ears with their pink lobes and far down upon her nape
deep in between the coils and braids it was of a bitumen brownness but in the sunlight it vibrated with a sheen like tarnished gold
like most large girls her movements were not hurried and this indefinite deliberateness of gesture this slow grace this certain ease of attitude was a charm that was all her own
but greatest charm of all was her simplicity that was not only in the calm regularity of her face with its statuesque evenness of contour its broad surface of cheek and forehead and the masses of her straight smooth hair but was apparent as well in the long line of her carriage from her foot to her waist and the single deep swell from her waist to her shoulder
almost unconsciously she dressed in harmony with this note of simplicity and on this occasion wore a skirt of plain dark blue calico and a white shirt waist crisp from the laundry
and yet for all the dignity of this rigourous simplicity there were about hilma small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintiness charming beyond words
even annixter could not help noticing that her feet were narrow and slender and that the little steel buckles of her low shoes were polished bright and that her fingertips and nails were of a fine rosy pink
he found himself wondering how it was that a girl in position should be able to keep herself so pretty so trim so clean and feminine but he reflected that her work was chiefly in the dairy and even there of the lightest order
she was on the ranch more for the sake of being with her parents than from any necessity of employment
vaguely he seemed to understand that in that great new land of the west in the openair healthy life of the ranches where the conditions of earning a livelihood were of the easiest refinement among the younger women was easily to be the refinement of education nor culture but the natural intuitive refinement of the woman not as yet defiled and crushed out by the sordid strenuous lifestruggle of overpopulated districts
it was the original intended and natural delicacy of an elemental existence close to nature close to life close to the great kindly earth
as hilma laid the tablespread her arms opened to their widest reach the white cloth setting a little glisten of reflected light underneath the chin annixter stirred in his place uneasily
oh its you is it miss hilma he remarked for the sake of saying something
how do you do sir she answered looking up resting for a moment on her outspread palms hope you are better
her voice was low in pitch and of a velvety huskiness seeming to come more from her chest than from her throat
well some better growled annixter
then suddenly he demanded that dog
a decrepit irish setter sometimes made his appearance in and about the ranch house sleeping under the bed and eating when anyone about the place thought to give him a plate of bread
annixter had no particular interest in the dog
for weeks at a time he ignored its existence
it was not his dog
but today it seemed as if he could not let the subject rest
for no reason that he could explain even to himself he recurred to it continually
he questioned hilma minutely all about the dog
who owned him
how old did she think he was
did she imagine the dog was sick
where had he got to
maybe he had crawled off to die somewhere
he recurred to the subject all through the meal apparently he could talk of nothing else and as she finally went away after clearing off the table he went onto the porch and called after her say miss hilma
yes sir
if that dog turns up again you let me know
very well sir
annixter returned to the diningroom and sat down in the chair he had just vacated
to hell with the dog he muttered enraged he could not tell why
when at length he allowed his attention to wander from hilma tree he found that he had been staring fixedly at a thermometer upon the wall opposite and this made him think that it had long been his intention to buy a fine barometer an instrument that could be accurately depended on
but the barometer suggested the present condition of the weather and the likelihood of rain
in such case much was to be done in the way of getting the seed ready and overhauling his ploughs and drills
he had not been away from the house in two days
it was time to be up and doing
he determined to put in the afternoon taking a look around and have a late supper
he would not go to los muertos he would ignore magnus invitation
possibly though it might be well to run over and see what was up
if i do he said to himself ride the buckskin
the buckskin was a halfbroken broncho that fought like a fiend under the saddle until the quirt and spur brought her to her senses
but annixter remembered that the trees cottage next the dairyhouse looked out upon the stables and perhaps hilma would see him while he was mounting the horse and be impressed with his courage
huh grunted annixter under his breath should like to see that fool delaney try to bust that bronch what like to see
however as annixter stepped from the porch of the ranch house he was surprised to notice a grey haze over all the sky the sunlight was gone there was a sense of coolness in the air the weathervane on the fine golden trotting horse with flamboyant mane and veering in a southwest wind
evidently the expected rain was close at hand
annixter crossed over to the stables reflecting that he could ride the buckskin to the trees cottage and tell hilma that he would not be home to supper
the conference at los muertos would be an admirable excuse for this and upon the spot he resolved to go over to the derrick ranch house after all
as he passed the trees cottage he observed with satisfaction that hilma was going to and fro in the front room
if he busted the buckskin in the yard before the stable she could not help but see
annixter found the stableman in the back of the barn greasing the axles of the buggy and ordered him to put the saddle on the buckskin
why i donot think shes here sir answered the stableman glancing into the stalls
no i remember now
delaney took her out just after dinner
his other horse went lame and he wanted to go down by the long trestle to mend the fence
he started out but had to come back
oh delaney got her did he
yes sir
he had a circus with her but he busted her right enough
when it comes to horse delaney can wipe the eye of any cowpuncher in the county i guess
he can can he observed annixter
then after a silence well all right billy put my saddle on whatever youve got here going over to los muertos this afternoon
want to look out for the rain mr annixter remarked billy
guess well have rain before night take a rubber coat answered annixter
bring the horse up to the ranch house when youre ready
annixter returned to the house to look for his rubber coat in deep disgust not permitting himself to glance toward the dairyhouse and the trees cottage
but as he reached the porch he heard the telephone ringing his call
it was presley who rang up from los muertos
he had heard from harran that annixter was perhaps coming over that evening
if he came would he mind bringing over he had left it at the quien sabe ranch the day before and had forgotten to come back that way for it
well objected annixter a surly note in his voice going to over
oh never mind then returned presley easily was to blame for forgetting it bother about it come over some of these days and get it myself
annixter hung up the transmitter with a vehement wrench and stamped out of the room banging the door
he found his rubber coat hanging in the hallway and swung into it with a fierce movement of the shoulders that all but started the seams
everything seemed to conspire to thwart him
it was just like that absentminded crazy poet presley to forget his wheel
well he could come after it himself
he annixter would ride horse anyhow
when he came out upon the porch he saw the wheel leaning against the fence where presley had left it
if it stayed there much longer the rain would catch it
annixter ripped out an oath
at every moment his illhumour was increasing
yet for all that he went back to the stable pushing the bicycle before him and countermanded his order directing the stableman to get the buggy ready
he himself carefully stowed bicycle under the seat covering it with a couple of empty sacks and a tarpaulin carriage cover
while he was doing this the stableman uttered an exclamation and paused in the act of backing the horse into the shafts holding up a hand listening
from the hollow roof of the barn and from the thick velvetlike padding of dust over the ground outside and from among the leaves of the few nearby trees and plants there came a vast monotonous murmur that seemed to issue from all quarters of the horizon at once a prolonged and subdued rustling sound steady even persistent your rain announced the stableman
the first of the season
and i got to be out in it fumed annixter and i suppose those swine will quit work on the big barn now
when the buggy was finally ready he put on his rubber coat climbed in and without waiting for the stableman to raise the top drove out into the rain a newlit cigar in his teeth
as he passed the dairyhouse he saw hilma standing in the doorway holding out her hand to the rain her face turned upward toward the grey sky amused and interested at this first shower of the wet season
she was so absorbed that she did not see annixter and his clumsy nod in her direction passed unnoticed
she did it on purpose annixter told himself chewing fiercely on his cigar
cuts me now hey
well this settle it
she leaves this ranch before a day older
he decided that he would put off his tour of inspection till the next day
travelling in the buggy as he did he must keep to the road which led to in very roundabout fashion by way of guadalajara
this rain would reduce the thick dust of the road to two feet of viscid mud
it would take him quite three hours to reach the ranch house on los muertos
he thought of delaney and the buckskin and ground his teeth
and all this trouble if you please because of a fool feemale girl
a fine way for him to waste his time
well now he was done with it
his decision was taken now
she should pack
steadily the rain increased
there was no wind
the thick veil of wet descended straight from sky to earth blurring distant outlines spreading a vast sheen of grey over all the landscape
its volume became greater the prolonged murmuring note took on a deeper tone
at the gate to the road which led across hopfields toward guadalajara annixter was obliged to descend and raise the top of the buggy
in doing so he caught the flesh of his hand in the joint of the iron elbow that supported the top and pinched it cruelly
it was the last misery the culmination of a long train of wretchedness
on the instant he hated hilma tree so fiercely that his sharply set teeth all but bit his cigar in two
while he was grabbing and wrenching at the buggytop the water from his hat brim dripping down upon his nose the horse restive under the drench of the rain moved uneasily you he shouted inarticulate with exasperation wait till i get hold of you you
but there was an interruption
delaney riding the buckskin came around a bend in the road at a slow trot and annixter getting into the buggy again found himself face to face with him
why hello mr annixter said he pulling up
kind of sort of wet isnot it
annixter his face suddenly scarlet sat back in his place abruptly exclaiming there you are are you been down there explained delaney with a motion of his head toward the railroad to mend that break in the fence by the long trestle and i thought while i was about it follow down along the fence toward guadalajara to see if there were any more breaks
but i guess its all right
oh you guess its all right do you observed annixter through his teeth returned the other bewildered at the truculent ring in voice mended that break by the long trestle just now why didnot you mend it a week ago shouted annixter wrathfully been looking for you all the morning i have and who told you you could take that buckskin
and the sheep were all over the right of way last night because of that break and here that filthy pip behrman comes down here this morning and wants to make trouble for me
suddenly he cried out what do i you for
what do i keep you around here for
think its just to fatten up your carcass hey
why mr annixter began delaney
and donot to me vociferated the other exciting himself with his own noise you say a word to me even to apologise
if spoken to you once about that break spoken fifty times
why sir declared delaney beginning to get indignant the sheep did it themselves last night told you not to to me clamoured annixter
but say look here get off the ranch
you get off the ranch
and taking that buckskin against my express orders
i wonot have your kind about the place not much easygoing enough lord knows but i donot propose to be imposed on the time
pack off you understand and do it lively
go to the foreman and tell him i told him to pay you off and then clear out
and you hear me he concluded with a menacing outthrust of his lower jaw you hear me if i catch you hanging around the ranch house after this or if i so much as see you on quien sabe show you the way off of it my friend at the toe of my boot
now then get out of the way and let me pass
angry beyond the power of retort delaney drove the spurs into the buckskin and passed the buggy in a single bound
annixter gathered up the reins and drove on muttering to himself and occasionally looking back to observe the buckskin flying toward the ranch house in a spattering shower of mud delaney urging her on his head bent down against the falling rain
huh grunted annixter with grim satisfaction a certain sense of good humour at length returning to him that just about takes the saleratus out of dough my friend
a little farther on annixter got out of the buggy a second time to open another gate that let him out upon the upper road not far distant from guadalajara
it was the road that connected that town with bonneville and that ran parallel with the railroad tracks
on the other side of the track he could see the infinite extension of the brown bare land of los muertos turning now to a soft moist welter of fertility under the insistent caressing of the rain
the hard sunbaked clods were decomposing the crevices between drinking the wet with an eager sucking noise
but the prospect was dreary the distant horizons were blotted under drifting mists of rain the eternal monotony of the earth lay open to the sombre low sky without a single adornment without a single variation from its melancholy flatness
near at hand the wires between the telegraph poles vibrated with a faint humming under the multitudinous fingering of the myriad of falling drops striking among them and dripping off steadily from one to another
the poles themselves were dark and swollen and glistening with wet while the little cones of glass on the transverse bars reflected the dull grey light of the end of the afternoon
as annixter was about to drive on a freight train passed coming from guadalajara going northward toward bonneville fresno and san francisco
it was a long train moving slowly methodically with a measured coughing of its locomotive and a rhythmic cadence of its trucks over the interstices of the rails
on two or three of the flat cars near its end annixter plainly saw magnus ploughs their bright coating of red and green paint setting a single brilliant note in all this array of grey and brown
annixter halted watching the train file past carrying ploughs away from his ranch at this very time of the first rain when they would be most needed
he watched it silent thoughtful and without articulate comment
even after it passed he sat in his place a long time watching it lose itself slowly in the distance its prolonged rumble diminishing to a faint murmur
soon he heard the engine sounding its whistle for the long trestle
but the moving train no longer carried with it that impression of terror and destruction that had so thrilled imagination the night before
it passed slowly on its way with a mournful roll of wheels like the passing of a cortege like a file of artillerycaissons charioting dead bodies the engines smoke enveloping it in a mournful veil leaving a sense of melancholy in its wake moving past there lugubrious lamentable infinitely sad under the grey sky and under the grey mist of rain which continued to fall with a subdued rustling sound steady persistent a vast monotonous murmur that seemed to come from all quarters of the horizon at once
when annixter arrived at the los muertos ranch house that same evening he found a little group already assembled in the diningroom
magnus derrick wearing the frock coat of broadcloth that he had put on for the occasion stood with his back to the fireplace
harran sat close at hand one leg thrown over the arm of his chair
presley lounged on the sofa in corduroys and high laced boots smoking cigarettes
broderson leaned on his folded arms at one corner of the dining table and genslinger editor and proprietor of the principal newspaper of the county the bonneville mercury stood with his hat and driving gloves under his arm opposite derrick a halfemptied glass of whiskey and water in his hand
as annixter entered he heard genslinger observe have a leader in the mercury tomorrow that will interest you people some talk of your ranch lands being graded in value this winter
i suppose you will all buy
in an instant the editors words had riveted upon him the attention of every man in the room
annixter broke the moments silence that followed with the remark well its about time they graded these lands of theirs
the question in issue in remark was of the most vital interest to the ranchers around bonneville and guadalajara
neither magnus derrick broderson annixter nor osterman actually owned all the ranches which they worked
as yet the vast majority of these wheat lands were the property of the and the explanation of this condition of affairs went back to the early history of the pacific and southwestern when as a bonus for the construction of the road the national government had granted to the company the odd numbered sections of land on either side of the proposed line of route for a distance of twenty miles
indisputably these sections belonged to the and the evennumbered sections being government property could be and had been taken up by the ranchers but the railroad sections or as they were called the alternate sections would have to be purchased direct from the railroad itself
but this had not prevented the farmers from coming in upon that part of the san joaquin
long before this the railroad had thrown open these lands and by means of circulars distributed broadcast throughout the state had expressly invited settlement thereon
at that time patents had not been issued to the railroad for their oddnumbered sections but as soon as the land was patented the railroad would grade it in value and offer it for sale the first occupants having the first chance of purchase
the price of these lands was to be fixed by the price the government put upon its own adjoining two dollars and a half per acre
with cultivation and improvement the ranches must inevitably appreciate in value
there was every chance to make fortunes
when the railroad lands about bonneville had been thrown open there had been almost a rush in the matter of settlement and broderson annixter derrick and osterman being foremost with their claims had secured the pick of the country
but the land once settled upon the and seemed to be in no hurry as to fixing exactly the value of its sections included in the various ranches and offering them for sale
the matter dragged along from year to year was forgotten for months together being only brought to mind on such occasions as this when the rumour spread that the general office was about to take definite action in the affair
as soon as the railroad wants to talk business with me observed annixter about selling me their interest in quien sabe ready
the land has more than quadrupled in value bet i could sell it tomorrow for fifteen dollars an acre and if i buy of the railroad for two and a half an acre theres boodle in the game
for two and a half exclaimed genslinger
you donot suppose the railroad will let their land go for any such figure as that do you
wherever did you get that idea
from the circulars and pamphlets answered harran that the railroad issued to us when they opened these lands
they are pledged to that
even the and couldnot break such a pledge as that
you are new in the country mr genslinger
you donot remember the conditions upon which we took up this land
and our improvements exclaimed annixter
why magnus and i have put about five thousand dollars between us into that irrigating ditch already
i guess we are not improving the land just to make it valuable for the railroad people
no matter how much we improve the land or how much it increases in value they have got to stick by their agreement on the basis of twofifty per acre one case where the and get everything in sight
genslinger frowned perplexed new in the country as harran says he answered but it seems to me that theres no fairness in that proposition
the presence of the railroad has helped increase the value of your ranches quite as much as your improvements
why should you get all the benefit of the rise in value and the railroad nothing
the fair way would be to share it between you donot care anything about that declared annixter
they agreed to charge but twofifty and theyve got to stick to it
well murmured genslinger from what i know of the affair i donot believe the and intends to sell for twofifty an acre at all
the managers of the road want the best price they can get for everything in these hard times
times arenot ever very hard for the railroad hazards old broderson
broderson was the oldest man in the room
he was about sixtyfive years of age venerable with a white beard his figure bent earthwards with hard work
he was a narrowminded man painfully conscientious in his statements lest he should be unjust to somebody a slow thinker unable to let a subject drop when once he had started upon it
he had no sooner uttered his remark about hard times than he was moved to qualify it
hard times he repeated a troubled perplexed note in his voice well yesyes
i suppose the road have hard times maybe
everybody course
i didnot mean that exactly
i believe in being just and fair to everybody
i mean that weve got to use their lines and pay their charges good years bad years the and being the only road in the state
that iswell when i say the only roadno i wonot say the road
of course there are other roads the and and the san francisco and north pacific that runs up to ukiah
i got a in ukiah not much of a wheat country round ukiah though they grow wheat there come to think
but i guess its too far north
well of course there isnot perhaps sixty thousand acres in the whole you include barley and oats
i donot know maybe its nearer forty thousand
i donot remember very well a good many years ago but annixter at the end of all patience turned to genslinger cutting short the old man oh rot
of course the railroad will sell at twofifty he cried got the contracts
look to them then mr annixter retorted genslinger significantly look to them
be sure that you are protected
soon after this genslinger took himself away and chinaman came in to set the table
what do you suppose he meant asked broderson when genslinger was gone
about this land business said annixter
oh i donot know
some tom fool idea we got their terms printed in black and white in their circulars their pledge
oh as to pledges murmured broderson the railroad is not always much hindered by those
osterman demanded annixter abruptly changing the subject as if it were not worth discussion that goat osterman coming down here tonight
you telephoned him didnot you presley inquired magnus
presley had taken princess nathalie upon his knee stroking her long sleek hair and the cat stupefied with beatitude had closed her eyes to two fine lines clawing softly at the corduroy of trousers with alternate paws
yes sir returned presley
he said he would be here
and as he spoke young osterman arrived
he was a young fellow but singularly inclined to baldness
his ears very red and large stuck out at right angles from either side of his head and his mouth too was great horizontal slit beneath his nose
his cheeks were of a brownish red the cheek bones a little salient
his face was that of a comic actor a singer of songs a man never at a loss for an answer continually striving to make a laugh
but he took no great interest in ranching and left the management of his land to his superintendents and foremen he himself living in bonneville
he was a poser a wearer of clothes forever acting a part striving to create an impression to draw attention to himself
he was not without a certain energy but he devoted it to small ends to perfecting himself in little accomplishments continually running after some new thing incapable of persisting long in any one course
at one moment his mania would be fencing the next tricks the next archery
for upwards of one month he had devoted himself to learning how to play two banjos simultaneously then abandoning this had developed a sudden passion for stamped leather work and had made a quantity of purses tennis belts and hat bands which he presented to young ladies of his acquaintance
it was his policy never to make an enemy
he was liked far better than he was respected
people spoke of him as that goat osterman or that fool osterman kid and invited him to dinner
he was of the sort who somehow cannot be ignored
if only because of his clamour he made himself important
if he had one abiding trait it was his desire of astonishing people and in some way best known to himself managed to cause the circulation of the most extraordinary stories wherein he himself was the chief actor
he was glib voluble dexterous ubiquitous a teller of funny stories a cracker of jokes
naturally enough he was heavily in debt but carried the burden of it with perfect nonchalance
the year before behrman had held mortgages for fully a third of his crop and had squeezed him viciously for interest
but for all that osterman and behrman were continually seen on the main street of bonneville
osterman was accustomed to slap behrman on his fat back declaring a good fellow old jellybelly after all hey
as osterman entered from the porch after hanging his cavalry poncho and dripping hat on the rack outside mrs derrick appeared in the door that opened from the diningroom into the glassroofed hallway just beyond
osterman saluted her with effusive cordiality and with ingratiating blandness am not going to stay she explained smiling pleasantly at the group of men her pretty wideopen brown eyes with their look of inquiry and innocence glancing from face to face only came to see if you wanted anything and to say how do you do
she began talking to old broderson making inquiries as to his wife who had been sick the last week and osterman turned to the company shaking hands all around keeping up an incessant stream of conversation
hello boys and girls
hello governor
sort of a gathering of the clans tonight
well if here isnot that man annixter
hello buck
what do you know
kind of dusty out tonight
at once annixter began to get red in the face retiring towards a corner of the room standing in an awkward position by the case of stuffed birds shambling and confused while mrs derrick was present standing rigidly on both feet his elbows close to his sides
but he was angry with osterman muttering imprecations to himself horribly vexed that the young fellow should call him buck before wife
this goat osterman he any sense that fool he ever learn how to behave before a feemale
calling him buck like that while mrs derrick was there
why a stableboy would know better a hired man would have better manners
all through the dinner that followed annixter was out of sorts sulking in his place refusing to eat by way of vindicating his selfrespect resolving to bring osterman up with a sharp turn if he called him buck again
the chinaman had made a certain kind of plum pudding for dessert and annixter who remembered other dinners at the had been saving himself for this and had meditated upon it all through the meal
no doubt it would restore all his good humour and he believed his stomach was so far recovered as to be able to stand it
but unfortunately the pudding was served with a sauce that he thick gruellike colourless mixture made from plain water and sugar
before he could interfere the chinaman had poured a quantity of it upon his plate
faugh exclaimed annixter
it makes me sick
take it away have mine straight if you donot mind good for your stomach buck observed young osterman makes it go down kind of sort of slick donot you see
sloop hey a good name
look here donot you call me buck
you donot seem to have any sense and besides it good for my stomach
i know better
what do know about my stomach anyhow
just looking at sloop like that makes me sick
a little while after this the chinaman cleared away the dessert and brought in coffee and cigars
the whiskey bottle and the syphon of sodawater reappeared
the men eased themselves in their places pushing back from the table lighting their cigars talking of the beginning of the rains and the prospects of a rise in wheat
broderson began an elaborate mental calculation trying to settle in his mind the exact date of his visit to ukiah and osterman did tricks with bread pills
but princess nathalie the cat was uneasy
annixter was occupying her own particular chair in which she slept every night
she could not go to sleep but spied upon him continually watching his every movement with her lambent yellow eyes clear as amber
then at length magnus who was at the head of the table moved in his place assuming a certain magisterial attitude
well gentlemen he observed have lost my case against the railroad the grainrate case
ulsteen decided against me and now i hear rumours to the effect that rates for the hauling of grain are to be advanced
when magnus had finished there was a moments silence each member of the group maintaining his attitude of attention and interest
it was harran who first spoke
behrman manipulated the whole affair a big deal of some kind in the air and if there is we all know who is back of it behrman of course but whos back of him
shelgrim
shelgrim
the name fell squarely in the midst of the conversation abrupt grave sombre big with suggestion pregnant with huge associations
no one in the group who was not familiar with it no one for that matter in the county the state the whole reach of the west the entire union that did not entertain convictions as to the man who carried it a giant figure in the finance a product of circumstance an inevitable result of conditions characteristic typical symbolic of ungovernable forces
in the new movement the new finance the reorganisation of capital the amalgamation of powers the consolidation of enormous one individual was more constantly in the eye of the world no one was more hated more dreaded no one more compelling of unwilling tribute to his commanding genius to the colossal intellect operating the width of an entire continent than the president and owner of the pacific and southwestern donot think however he has moved yet said magnus
the thing for us then exclaimed osterman is to stand from under before he does
moved yet snorted annixter probably moved so long ago that weve never noticed it
in any case hazarded magnus it is scarcely probable that the it is to been consummated
if we act quickly there may be a chance
act quickly
how demanded annixter
good lord what can you do cinched already
it all amounts to just this tried it and tried it and we are stuck every time
you yourself derrick have just lost your grainrate case
behrman did you up
shelgrim owns the courts got men like ulsteen in his pocket got the railroad commission in his pocket got the governor of the state in his pocket
he keeps a milliondollar lobby at sacramento every minute of the time the legislature is in session hes got his own men on the floor of the united states senate
he has the whole thing organised like an army corps
what you going to do
he sits in his office in san francisco and pulls the strings and weve got to dance hazarded broderson but theres the interstate commerce commission
at least on longhaul rates they hoh yes the interstate commerce commission shouted annixter scornfully great ainot it
the greatest punch and judy show on earth almost as good as the railroad commission
there never was and there never will be a california railroad commission not in the pay of the and it is to the railroad commission nevertheless remarked magnus that the people of the state must look for relief
that is our only hope
once elect commissioners who would be loyal to the people and the whole system of excessive rates falls to the ground
well why not a railroad commission of our own then suddenly declared young osterman
because it canot be done retorted annixter and if you could you canot organise the farmers in the san joaquin
we tried it once and it was enough to turn your stomach
the railroad quietly bought delegates through behrman and did us up
well thats the game to play said osterman decisively buy delegates the only game that seems to win admitted harran gloomily
or ever will win exclaimed osterman a sudden excitement seeming to take possession of him
his face of a comic actor with its great slit of mouth and stiff red abruptly pink
look here he cried this thing is getting desperate fought and fought in the courts and out and weve tried agitation all the rest of it and behrman sacks us every time
now comes the time when theres a prospect of a big crop weve had no rain for two years and the land has had a long rest
if there is any rain at all this winter well have a bonanza year and just at this very moment when weve got our chance to pay off our mortgages and get clear of debt and make a is shelgrim making a deal to cinch us and put up rates
and now heres the primaries coming off and a new railroad commission going in why shelgrim chose this time to make his deal
if we wait till shelgrim pulls it off were done for thats flat
i tell you were in a fix if we donot keep an eye open
things are getting desperate
magnus has just said that the key to the whole thing is the railroad commission
well why not have a commission of our own
never mind how we get it lets get it
if its got to be bought lets buy it and put our own men on it and dictate what the rates will be
suppose it costs a hundred thousand dollars
well well get back more than that in cheap rates
mr osterman said magnus fixing the young man with a swift glance mr osterman you are proposing a scheme of bribery sir am proposing repeated osterman a scheme of bribery
exactly so
and a crazy wildeyed scheme at that said annixter gruffly
even supposing you bought a railroad commission and got your schedule of low rates what happens
the and crowd get out an injunction and tie you up
they would tie themselves up too
hauling at low rates is better than no hauling at all
the wheat has got to be moved
oh rot cried annixter you ever going to learn any sense you know that cheap transportation would benefit the liverpool buyers and not us it be into you that you canot buck against the railroad
when you try to buy a board of commissioners donot you see that youll have to bid against the railroad bid against a corporation that can chuck out millions to our thousands
do you think you can bid against the and the railroad donot need to know we are in the game against them till weve got our men seated
and when youve got them seated whats to prevent the corporation buying them right over your head
if weve got the right kind of men in they could not be bought that way interposed harran donot know but what theres something in what osterman says have the naming of the commission and wed name honest men
annixter struck the table with his fist in exasperation
honest men he shouted the kind of men you could get to go into such a scheme would have to be to begin with
broderson shifting uneasily in his place fingering his beard with a vague uncertain gesture spoke again it would be the of out against the certainty of shelgrim doing us up
that is he hastened to add a certainty pretty near a certainty
of course it would be a chance exclaimed osterman
but its come to the point where weve got to take chances risk a big stake to make a big strike and risk is better than sure failure can be no party to a scheme of avowed bribery and corruption mr osterman declared magnus a ring of severity in his voice am surprised sir that you should even broach the subject in my hearing
and cried annixter it canot be done donot know muttered harran maybe it just wants a little spark like this to fire the whole train
magnus glanced at his son in considerable surprise
he had not expected this of harran
but so great was his affection for his son so accustomed had he become to listening to his advice to respecting his opinions that for the moment after the first shock of surprise and disappointment he was influenced to give a certain degree of attention to this new proposition
he in no way countenanced it
at any moment he was prepared to rise in his place and denounce it and osterman both
it was trickery of the most contemptible order a thing he believed to be unknown to the old school of politics and statesmanship to which he was proud to belong but since harran even for one moment considered it he magnus who trusted harran implicitly would do it was only to oppose and defeat it in its very beginnings
and abruptly the discussion began
gradually osterman by dint of his clamour his strident reiteration the plausibility of his glib ready assertions the ease with which he extricated himself when apparently driven to a corner completely won over old broderson to his way of thinking
osterman bewildered him with his volubility the lightning rapidity with which he leaped from one subject to another garrulous witty flamboyant terrifying the old man with pictures of the swift approach of ruin the imminence of danger
annixter who led the argument against argument though he to poor advantage unable to present his side effectively
he called osterman a fool a goat a senseless crazyheaded jackass but was unable to refute his assertions
his debate was the clumsy heaving of brickbats brutal direct
he contradicted everything osterman said as a matter of principle made conflicting assertions declarations that were absolutely inconsistent and when osterman or harran used these against him could only exclaim well in a way its so and then again in a way it isnot
but suddenly osterman discovered a new argument
if we swing this deal he cried got old jellybelly behrman right where we want him the man that does us every time cried harran
if there is dirty work to be done in which the railroad doesnot wish to appear it is behrman who does it
if the freight rates are to be adjusted to squeeze us a little harder it is behrman who regulates what we can stand
if theres a judge to be bought it is behrman who does the bargaining
if there is a jury to be bribed it is behrman who handles the money
if there is an election to be jobbed it is behrman who manipulates it
behrman here and behrman there
it is behrman we come against every time we make a move
it is behrman who has the grip of us and will never let go till he has squeezed us bone dry
why when i think of it all sometimes i wonder i keep my hands off the man
osterman got on his feet leaning across the table gesturing wildly with his right hand his seriocomic face with its bald forehead and stiff red ears was inflamed with excitement
he took the floor creating an impression attracting all attention to himself playing to the gallery gesticulating clamourous full of noise
well now is your chance to get even he vociferated
it is now or never
you can take it and save the situation for yourselves and all california or you can leave it and rot on your own ranches
buck i know you
i know youre not afraid of anything that wears skin
i know youve got sand all through you and i know if i showed you how we could put our deal through and seat a commission of our own you wouldnot hang back
governor youre a brave man
you know the advantage of prompt and fearless action
you are not the sort to shrink from taking chances
to play for big stakes is just your stake a fortune on the turn of a card
you didnot get the reputation of being the strongest poker player in el dorado county for nothing
now heres the biggest gamble that ever came your way
if we stand up to it like men with guts in us well win out
if we hesitate were lost donot suppose you can help playing the goat osterman remarked annixter but whats your idea
what do you think we can do not saying he hastened to interpose that youve anyways convinced me by all this cackling
i know as well as you that we are in a hole
but i knew that before i came here tonight not done anything to make me change my mind
but just what do you propose hear it
well i say the first thing to do is to see disbrow the political boss of the denver pueblo and mojave road
we will have to get in with the machine some way and thats particularly why i want magnus with us
he knows politics better than any of us and if we donot want to get sold again we will have to have some one thats in the know to steer us
the only politics i understand mr osterman answered magnus sternly are honest politics
you must look elsewhere for your political manager
i refuse to have any part in this matter
if the railroad commission can be nominated legitimately if your arrangements can be made without bribery i am with you to the last iota of my ability
well you canot get what you want without paying for it contradicted annixter
broderson was about to speak when osterman kicked his foot under the table
he himself held his peace
he was quick to see that if he could involve magnus and annixter in an argument annixter for the mere love of contention would oppose the governor and without knowing it would commit himself to this was precisely what happened
in a few moments annixter was declaring at top voice his readiness to mortgage the crop of quien sabe if necessary for the sake of busting behrman
he could see no great obstacle in the way of controlling the nominating convention so far as securing the naming of two railroad commissioners was concerned
two was all they needed
probably it cost money
you didnot get something for nothing
it would cost them all a good deal more if they sat like lumps on a log and played tiddledywinks while shelgrim sold out from under them
then there was this too the and were hard up just then
the shortage on the wheat crop for the last two years had affected them too
they were retrenching in expenditures all along the line they just cut wages in all departments
there was this affair of to prove it
the railroad didnot always act as a unit either
there was always a party in it that opposed spending too much money
he would bet that party was strong just now
he was kind of sick himself of being kicked by behrman that pip turned up on his ranch that very day to bully him about his own line fence
next he would be telling him what kind of clothes he ought to wear
harran had the right idea
somebody had got to be busted mighty soon now and he didnot propose that it should be he
now you are talking something like sense observed osterman thought you would see it like that when you got my idea
your idea idea cried annixter
why had this idea myself for over three years
what about disbrow asked harran hastening to interrupt
why do we want to see disbrow
disbrow is the political man for the denver pueblo and mojave answered osterman and you see its like this the mojave road donot run up into the valley at all
their terminus is way to the south of us and they donot care anything about grain rates through the san joaquin
they donot care how antirailroad the commission is because the rulings canot affect them
but they divide traffic with the and in the southern part of the state and they have a good deal of influence with that road
i want to get the mojave road through disbrow to recommend a commissioner of our choosing to the and and have the and adopt him as their own
who for instance
darrell that los angeles manremember
well darrell is no particular friend of disbrow said annixter
why should disbrow take him up cried osterman
we make it worth while to do it
we go to him and say mr disbrow you manage the politics for the mojave railroad and what you say goes with your board of directors
we want you to adopt our candidate for railroad commissioner for the third district
how much do you want for doing it
i we can buy disbrow
that gives us one commissioner
we need not bother about that any more
in the first district we donot make any move at all
we let the political managers of the and nominate whoever they like
then we concentrate all our efforts to putting in our man in the second district
there is where the big fight will come see perfectly well what you mean mr osterman observed magnus but make no mistake sir as to my attitude in this business
you may count me as out of it entirely
well suppose we win put in annixter truculently already acknowledging himself as involved in the proposed undertaking suppose we win and get low rates for hauling grain
how about you then
you count yourself then donot you
you get all the benefit of lower rates without sharing any of the risks we take to secure them
no nor any of the expense either
no you wonot dirty your fingers with helping us put this deal through but you wonot be so cursed particular when it comes to sharing the profits will you
magnus rose abruptly to his full height the nostrils of his thin hawklike nose vibrating his smoothshaven face paler than ever
stop right where you are sir he exclaimed
you forget yourself mr annixter
please understand that i tolerate such words as you have permitted yourself to make use of from no man not even from my guest
i shall ask you to apologise
in an instant he dominated the entire group imposing a respect that was as much fear as admiration
no one made response
for the moment he was the master again the leader
like so many delinquent schoolboys the others cowered before him ashamed put to confusion unable to find their tongues
in that brief instant of silence following upon outburst and while he held them subdued and overmastered the fabric of their scheme of corruption and dishonesty trembled to its base
it was the last protest of the old school rising up there in denunciation of the new order of things the statesman opposed to the politician honesty rectitude uncompromising integrity prevailing for the last time against the devious manoeuvring the evil communications the rotten expediency of a corrupted institution
for a few seconds no one answered
then annixter moving abruptly and uneasily in his place muttered spoke upon provocation
if you like well consider it unsaid
i donot know whats going to become of out of business i presume understand magnus all right put in osterman
he donot have to go into this thing if its against his conscience all right
magnus can stay out if he wants to but that wonot prevent us going ahead and seeing what we can do
only theres this about it
he turned again to magnus speaking with every degree of earnestness every appearance of conviction did not deny governor from the very start that this would mean bribery
but you donot suppose that i like the idea either
if there was one legitimate hope that was yet left untried no matter how forlorn it was i would try it
but theres not
it is literally and soberly true that every means of honest been attempted
shelgrim is going to cinch us
grain rates are increasing while on the other hand the price of wheat is sagging lower and lower all the time
if we donot do something we are ruined
osterman paused for a moment allowing precisely the right number of seconds to elapse then altering and lowering his voice added respect the principles
i admire them
they do him every degree of credit
then turning directly to magnus he concluded with but i only want you to ask yourself sir if at such a crisis one ought to think of oneself to consider purely personal motives in such a desperate situation as this
now we want you with us governor perhaps not openly if you donot wish it but tacitly at least
i wonot ask you for an answer tonight but what i do ask of you is to consider this matter seriously and think over the whole business
will you do it
osterman ceased definitely to speak leaning forward across the table his eyes fixed on face
there was a silence
outside the rain fell continually with an even monotonous murmur
in the group of men around the table no one stirred nor spoke
they looked steadily at magnus who for the moment kept his glance fixed thoughtfully upon the table before him
in another moment he raised his head and looked from face to face around the group
after all these were his neighbours his friends men with whom he had been upon the closest terms of association
in a way they represented what now had come to be his world
his single swift glance took in the men one after another
annixter rugged crude sitting awkwardly and uncomfortably in his chair his unhandsome face with its outthrust lower lip and deeply cleft masculine chin flushed and eager his yellow hair disordered the one tuft on the crown standing stiffly forth like the feather in an scalp lock broderson vaguely combing at his long beard with a persistent maniacal gesture distressed troubled and uneasy osterman with his comedy face the face of a musichall singer his head bald and set off by his great red ears leaning back in his place softly cracking the knuckle of a forefinger and last of all and close to his elbow his son his support his confidant and companion harran so like himself with his own erect fine carriage his thin beaklike nose and his blond hair with its tendency to curl in a forward direction in front of the ears young strong courageous full of the promise of the future years
his blue eyes looked straight into his fathers with what magnus could fancy a glance of appeal
magnus could see that expression in the faces of the others very plainly
they looked to him as their natural leader their chief who was to bring them out from this abominable trouble which was closing in upon them and in them all he saw many types men around his table on that night of the first rain of a coming to stand in his imagination for many the farmers ranchers and wheat growers of the great san joaquin
their words were the words of a whole community their distress the distress of an entire state harried beyond the bounds of endurance driven to the wall coerced exploited harassed to the limits of exasperation will think of it he said then hastened to add but i can tell you beforehand that you may expect only a refusal
after magnus had spoken there was a prolonged silence
the conference seemed of itself to have come to an end for that evening
presley lighted another cigarette from the butt of the one he had been smoking and the cat princess nathalie disturbed by his movement and by a whiff of drifting smoke jumped from his knee to the floor and picking her way across the room to annixter rubbed gently against his legs her tail in the air her back delicately arched
no doubt she thought it time to settle herself for the night and as annixter gave no indication of vacating his chair she chose this way of cajoling him into ceding his place to her
but annixter was irritated at the attentions misunderstanding their motive
get out he exclaimed lifting his feet to the rung of the chair
lord love me but i sure do hate a cat
by the way observed osterman passed genslinger by the gate as i came in tonight
had he been here
yes he was here said harran and but annixter took the words out of his mouth
he says theres some talk of the railroad selling us their sections this winter
oh he did did he exclaimed osterman interested at once
where did he hear that
where does a railroad paper get its news
from the general office i suppose hope he didnot get it straight from headquarters that the land was to be graded at twenty dollars an acre murmured broderson that demanded osterman
twenty dollars
here put me on somebody all up
what did genslinger say
oh you neednot get scared said annixter
genslinger donot know thats all
he thinks there was no understanding that the price of the land should not be advanced when the and came to sell to us
oh muttered osterman relieved
magnus who had gone out into the office on the other side of the glassroofed hallway returned with a long yellow envelope in his hand stuffed with newspaper clippings and thin closely printed pamphlets
here is the circular he remarked drawing out one of the pamphlets
the conditions of settlement to which the railroad obligated itself are very explicit
he ran over the pages of the circular then read aloud company invites settlers to go upon its lands before patents are issued or the road is completed and intends in such cases to sell to them in preference to any other applicants and at a price based upon the value of the land without improvements and on the other page here he remarked they refer to this again
in ascertaining the value of the lands any improvements that a settler or any other person may have on the lands will not be taken into consideration neither will the price be increased in consequence thereof
settlers are thus insured that in addition to being accorded the first privilege of purchase at the graded price they will also be protected in their improvements
and here he commented in section it reads the lands are not uniform in price but are offered at various figures from upward per acre
usually land covered with tall timber is held at per acre and that with pine at most is for sale at and when you come to read that carefully hazarded old broderson not so is for sale at twofifty an acre it says
that donot mean that only means i wish now that i had secured a more ironclad agreement from the and when i took up its sections on my ranch genslinger is in a position to know the intentions of the railroad
at least is in with them
all newspaper men are
those i mean who are subsidised by the general office
but perhaps genslinger isnot subsidised i donot know am not sure
oh you donot know and you do know and maybe and perhaps and youre not so sure vociferated annixter
how about ignoring the value of our improvements
nothing hazy about statement i guess
it says in so many words that any improvements we make will not be considered when the land is appraised and thats the same thing isnot it
the unimproved land is worth twofifty an acre only timber land is worth more and theres none too much timber about here
well one thing at a time said harran
the thing for us now is to get into this primary election and the convention and see if we can push our men for railroad commissioners
right declared annixter
he rose stretching his arms above his head about talked all the wind out of me he said
think be moving along pretty near midnight
but when guests turned their attention to the matter of returning to their different ranches they abruptly realised that the downpour had doubled and trebled in its volume since earlier in the evening
the fields and roads were veritable seas of viscid mud the night absolutely blackdark assuredly not a night in which to venture out
magnus insisted that the three ranchers should put up at los muertos
osterman accepted at once annixter after an interminable discussion allowed himself to be persuaded in the end accepting as though granting a favour
broderson protested that his wife who was not well would expect him to return that night and would no doubt fret if he did not appear
furthermore he lived close by at the junction of the county and lower road
he put a sack over his head and shoulders persistently declining offered umbrella and rubber coat and hurried away remarking that he had no foreman on his ranch and had to be up and about at five the next morning to put his men to work
fool muttered annixter when the old man had gone
imagine farming a ranch the size of his without a foreman
harran showed osterman and annixter where they were to sleep in adjoining rooms
magnus soon afterward retired
osterman found an excuse for going to bed but annixter and harran remained in the latters room in a haze of blue tobacco smoke talking talking
but at length at the end of all argument annixter got up remarking well going to turn in nearly two oclock
he went to his room closing the door and harran opening his window to clear out the tobacco smoke looked out for a moment across the country toward the south
the darkness was profound impenetrable the rain fell with an uninterrupted roar
near at hand one could hear the sound of dripping eaves and foliage and the eager sucking sound of the drinking earth and abruptly while harran stood looking out one hand upon the upraised sash a great puff of the outside air invaded the room odourous with the reek of the soaking earth redolent with fertility pungent heavy tepid
he closed the window again and sat for a few moments on the edge of the bed one shoe in his hand thoughtful and absorbed wondering if his father would involve himself in this new scheme wondering if after all he wanted him to
but suddenly he was aware of a commotion issuing from the direction of room and the voice of annixter himself upraised in expostulation and exasperation
the door of the room to which annixter had been assigned opened with a violent wrench and an angry voice exclaimed to anybody who would listen oh yes funny isnot it
in a way its funny and then again in a way it isnot
the door banged to so that all the windows of the house rattled in their frames
harran hurried out into the diningroom and there met presley and his father who had been aroused as well by clamour
osterman was there too his bald head gleaming like a bulb of ivory in the light of the lamp that magnus carried all up demanded osterman
whatever in the world is the matter with buck
confused and terrible sounds came from behind the door of room
a prolonged monologue of grievance broken by explosions of wrath and the vague noise of some one in a furious hurry
all at once and before harran had a chance to knock on the door annixter flung it open
his face was blazing with anger his outthrust lip more prominent than ever his wiry yellow hair in disarray the tuft on the crown sticking straight into the air like the upraised hackles of an angry hound
evidently he had been dressing himself with the most headlong rapidity he had not yet put on his coat and vest but carried them over his arm while with his disengaged hand he kept hitching his suspenders over his shoulders with a persistent and hypnotic gesture
without a moments pause he gave vent to his indignation in a torrent of words
ah yes in my bed sloop aha
i know the man who put it there he went on glaring at osterman and that man is a sloop
slimy disgusting stuff you heard me say i didnot like it when the chink passed it to me at just for that reason you put it in my bed and i stick my feet into it when i turn in
funny isnot it
oh yes too funny for any use laugh a little louder if i was you
well buck protested harran as he noticed the hat in hand not going home just for annixter turned on him with a shout get plumb out of here he trumpeted wonot stay here another minute
he swung into his waistcoat and coat scrabbling at the buttons in the violence of his emotions
and i donot know but what it will make me sick again to go out in a night like this
i wonot stay
some things are funny and then again there are some things that are not
ah yes sloop
well thats all right
i can be funny too when you come to that
you donot get a cent of money out of me
you can do your dirty bribery in your own dirty way
i wonot come into this scheme at all
i wash my hands of the whole business rotten and its wildeyed its dirt from start to finish and youll all land in prison
you can count me out
but buck look here you crazy fool cried harran donot know who put that stuff in your bed but not going to let you go back to quien sabe in a rain like this know who put it in clamoured the other shaking his fists and donot call me buck and do as i please
i go back home get plumb out of here
sorry i came
sorry i ever lent myself to such a disgusting dishonest dirty bribery game as this all tonight
i wonot put a dime into it no not a penny
he stormed to the door leading out upon the porch deaf to all reason
harran and presley followed him trying to dissuade him from going home at that time of night and in such a storm but annixter was not to be placated
he stamped across to the barn where his horse and buggy had been stabled splashing through the puddles under foot going out of his way to drench himself refusing even to allow presley and harran to help him harness the horse the use of making a fool of yourself annixter remonstrated presley as annixter backed the horse from the stall
you act just like a boy
if osterman wants to play the goat why should you help him out a vociferated annixter
you donot understand presley
it runs in my family to hate anything sticky heredity
how would you like to get into bed at two in the morning and jam your feet down into a slimy mess like that
oh no not so funny then
and you mark my words mr harran derrick he continued as he climbed into the buggy shaking the whip toward harran this business we talked over of it yellow too dishonest
he cut the horse across the back with the whip and drove out into the pelting rain
in a few seconds the sound of his buggy wheels was lost in the muffled roar of the downpour
harran and presley closed the barn and returned to the house sheltering themselves under a tarpaulin carriage cover
once inside harran went to remonstrate with osterman who was still up
magnus had again retired
the house had fallen quiet again
as presley crossed the diningroom on the way to his own apartment in the second story of the house he paused for a moment looking about him
in the dull light of the lowered lamps the redwood panelling of the room showed a dark crimson as though stained with blood
on the massive slab of the dining table the halfemptied glasses and bottles stood about in the confusion in which they had been left reflecting themselves deep into the polished wood the glass doors of the case of stuffed birds was a subdued shimmer the manycoloured navajo blanket over the couch seemed a mere patch of brown
around the table the chairs in which the men had sat throughout the evening still ranged themselves in a semicircle vaguely suggestive of the conference of the past few hours with all its possibilities of good and evil its significance of a future big with portent
the room was still
only on the cushions of the chair that annixter had occupied the cat princess nathalie at last comfortably settled in her accustomed place dozed complacently her paws tucked under her breast filling the deserted room with the subdued murmur of her contented purr
on the quien sabe ranch in one of its western divisions near the line fence that divided it from the osterman holding vanamee was harnessing the horses to the plough to which he had been assigned two days before a stableboy from the division barn helping him
promptly discharged from the employ of the sheepraisers after the lamentable accident near the long trestle vanamee had presented himself to harran asking for employment
the season was beginning on all the ranches work was being resumed
the rain had put the ground into admirable condition for ploughing and annixter broderson and osterman all had their gangs at work
thus vanamee was vastly surprised to find los muertos idle the horses still in the barns the men gathering in the shade of the bunkhouse and eatinghouse smoking dozing or going aimlessly about their arms dangling
the ploughs for which magnus and harran were waiting in a fury of impatience had not yet arrived and since the management of los muertos had counted upon having these in hand long before this time no provision had been made for keeping the old stock in repair many of these old ploughs were useless broken and out of order some had been sold
it could not be said definitely when the new ploughs would arrive
harran had decided to wait one week longer and then in case of their nonappearance to buy a consignment of the old style of plough from the dealers in bonneville
he could afford to lose the money better than he could afford to lose the season
failing of work on los muertos vanamee had gone to quien sabe
annixter whom he had spoken to first had sent him across the ranch to one of his division superintendents and this latter after assuring himself of familiarity with horses and his previous though somewhat los muertos had taken him on as a driver of one of the gang ploughs then at work on his division
the evening before when the foreman had blown his whistle at six oclock the long line of ploughs had halted upon the instant and the drivers unharnessing their teams had taken them back to the division the ploughs as they were in the furrows
but an hour after daylight the next morning the work was resumed
after breakfast vanamee riding one horse and leading the others had returned to the line of ploughs together with the other drivers
now he was busy harnessing the team
at the division blacksmith put had been obliged to wait while one of his lead horses was shod and he had thus been delayed quite five minutes
nearly all the other teams were harnessed the drivers on their seats waiting for the foremans signal
all ready here inquired the foreman driving up to team in his buggy
all ready sir answered vanamee buckling the last strap
he climbed to his seat shaking out the reins and turning about looked back along the line then all around him at the landscape inundated with the brilliant glow of the early morning
the day was fine
since the first rain of the season there had been no other
now the sky was without a cloud pale blue delicate luminous scintillating with morning
the great brown earth turned a huge flank to it exhaling the moisture of the early dew
the atmosphere washed clean of dust and mist was translucent as crystal
far off to the east the hills on the other side of broderson creek stood out against the pallid saffron of the horizon as flat and as sharply outlined as if pasted on the sky
the campanile of the ancient mission of san juan seemed as fine as frost work
all about between the horizons the carpet of the land unrolled itself to infinity
but now it was no longer parched with heat cracked and warped by a merciless sun powdered with dust
the rain had done its work not a clod that was not swollen with fertility not a fissure that did not exhale the sense of fecundity
one could not take a dozen steps upon the ranches without the brusque sensation that underfoot the land was alive roused at last from its sleep palpitating with the desire of reproduction
deep down there in the recesses of the soil the great heart throbbed once more thrilling with passion vibrating with desire offering itself to the caress of the plough insistent eager imperious
dimly one felt the deepseated trouble of the earth the uneasy agitation of its members the hidden tumult of its womb demanding to be made fruitful to reproduce to disengage the eternal renascent germ of life that stirred and struggled in its loins
the ploughs thirtyfive in number each drawn by its team of ten stretched in an interminable line nearly a quarter of a mile in length behind and ahead of vanamee
they were arranged as it were en echelon not in one directly behind the other but each succeeding plough its own width farther in the field than the one in front of it
each of these ploughs held five shears so that when the entire company was in motion one hundred and seventyfive furrows were made at the same instant
at a distance the ploughs resembled a great column of field artillery
each driver was in his place his glance alternating between his horses and the foreman nearest at hand
other foremen in their buggies or buckboards were at intervals along the line like battery lieutenants
annixter himself on horseback in boots and campaign hat a cigar in his teeth overlooked the scene
the division superintendent on the opposite side of the line galloped past to a position at the head
for a long moment there was a silence
a sense of preparedness ran from end to end of the column
all things were ready each man in his place
the days work was about to begin
suddenly from a distance at the head of the line came the shrill trilling of a whistle
at once the foreman nearest vanamee repeated it at the same time turning down the line and waving one arm
the signal was repeated whistle answering whistle till the sounds lost themselves in the distance
at once the line of ploughs lost its immobility moving forward getting slowly under way the horses straining in the traces
a prolonged movement rippled from team to team disengaging in its passage a multitude of click of buckles the creak of straining leather the subdued clash of machinery the cracking of whips the deep breathing of nearly four hundred horses the abrupt commands and cries of the drivers and last of all the prolonged soothing murmur of the thick brown earth turning steadily from the multitude of advancing shears
the ploughing thus commenced continued
the sun rose higher
steadily the hundred iron hands kneaded and furrowed and stroked the brown humid earth the hundred iron teeth bit deep into the flesh
perched on his seat the moist living reins slipping and tugging in his hands vanamee in the midst of this steady confusion of constantly varying sensation sight interrupted by sound sound mingling with sight on this swaying vibrating seat quivering with the prolonged thrill of the earth lapsed to a sort of pleasing numbness in a sense hypnotised by the weaving maze of things in which he found himself involved
to keep his team at an even regular gait maintaining the precise interval to run his furrows as closely as possible to those already made by the plough in for the moment was the entire sum of his duties
but while one part of his brain alert and watchful took cognisance of these matters all the greater part was lulled and stupefied with the long monotony of the affair
the ploughing now in full swing enveloped him in a vague slowmoving whirl of things
underneath him was the jarring jolting trembling machine not a clod was turned not an obstacle encountered that he did not receive the swift impression of it through all his body the very friction of the damp soil sliding incessantly from the shiny surface of the shears seemed to reproduce itself in his fingertips and along the back of his head
he heard the horsehoofs by the myriads crushing down easily deeply into the loam the prolonged clinking of tracechains the working of the smooth brown flanks in the harness the clatter of wooden hames the champing of bits the click of iron shoes against pebbles the brittle stubble of the surface ground crackling and snapping as the furrows turned the sonorous steady breaths wrenched from the deep labouring chests strapbound shining with sweat and all along the line the voices of the men talking to the horses
everywhere there were visions of glossy brown backs straining heaving swollen with muscle harness streaked with specks of froth broad cupshaped hoofs heavy with brown loam mens faces red with tan blue overalls spotted with axlegrease muscled hands the knuckles whitened in their grip on the reins and through it all the ammoniacal smell of the horses the bitter reek of perspiration of beasts and men the aroma of warm leather the scent of dead stronger and more penetrating than everything else the heavy enervating odour of the upturned living earth
at intervals from the tops of one of the rare low swells of the land vanamee overlooked a wider horizon
on the other divisions of quien sabe the same work was in progress
occasionally he could see another column of ploughs in the adjoining so close at hand that the subdued murmur of its movements reached his ear sometimes so distant that it resolved itself into a long brown streak upon the grey of the ground
farther off to the west on the osterman ranch other columns came and went and once from the crest of the highest swell on his division vanamee caught a distant glimpse of the broderson ranch
there too moving specks indicated that the ploughing was under way
and farther away still far off there beyond the fine line of the horizons over the curve of the globe the shoulder of the earth he knew were other ranches and beyond these others and beyond these still others the immensities multiplying to infinity
everywhere throughout the great san joaquin unseen and unheard a thousand ploughs upstirred the land tens of thousands of shears clutched deep into the warm moist soil
it was the long stroking caress vigorous male powerful for which the earth seemed panting
the heroic embrace of a multitude of iron hands gripping deep into the brown warm flesh of the land that quivered responsive and passionate under this rude advance so robust as to be almost an assault so violent as to be veritably brutal
there under the sun and under the speckless sheen of the sky the wooing of the titan began the vast primal passion the two worldforces the elemental male and female locked in a colossal embrace at grapples in the throes of an infinite desire at once terrible and divine knowing no law untamed savage natural sublime
from time to time the gang in which vanamee worked halted on the signal from foreman or overseer
the horses came to a standstill the vague clamour of the work lapsed away
then the minutes passed
the whole work hung suspended
all up and down the line one demanded what had happened
the division superintendent galloped past perplexed and anxious
for the moment one of the ploughs was out of order a bolt had slipped a lever refused to work or a machine had become immobilised in heavy ground or a horse had lamed himself
once even toward noon an entire plough was taken out of the line so out of gear that a messenger had to be sent to the division forge to summon the machinist
annixter had disappeared
he had ridden farther on to the other divisions of his ranch to watch the work in progress there
at twelve oclock according to his orders all the division superintendents put themselves in communication with him by means of the telephone wires that connected each of the division houses reporting the condition of the work the number of acres covered the prospects of each plough traversing its daily average of twenty miles
at halfpast twelve vanamee and the rest of the drivers ate their lunch in the field the tin buckets having been distributed to them that morning after breakfast
but in the evening the routine of the previous day was repeated and vanamee unharnessing his team riding one horse and leading the others returned to the division barns and bunkhouse
it was between six and seven oclock
the half hundred men of the gang threw themselves upon the supper the chinese cooks had set out in the shed of the eatinghouse long as a bowling alley unpainted crude the seats benches the table covered with oil cloth
overhead a halfdozen kerosene lamps flared and smoked
the table was taken as if by assault the clatter of iron knives upon the tin plates was as the reverberation of hail upon a metal roof
the ploughmen rinsed their throats with great draughts of wine and their elbows wide their foreheads flushed resumed the attack upon the beef and bread eating as though they would never have enough
all up and down the long table where the kerosene lamps reflected themselves deep in the oilcloth cover one heard the incessant sounds of mastication and saw the uninterrupted movement of great jaws
at every moment one or another of the men demanded a fresh portion of beef another pint of wine another halfloaf of bread
for upwards of an hour the gang ate
it was no longer a supper
it was a veritable barbecue a crude and primitive feasting barbaric homeric
but in all this scene vanamee saw nothing repulsive
presley would have abhorred feeding of the people this gorging of the human animal eager for its meat
vanamee simple uncomplicated living so close to nature and the rudimentary life understood its significance
he knew very well that within a short halfhour after this meal the men would throw themselves down in their bunks to sleep without moving inert and stupefied with fatigue till the morning
work food and sleep all life reduced to its bare essentials uncomplex honest healthy
they were strong these men with the strength of the soil they worked in touch with the essential things back again to the starting point of civilisation coarse vital real and sane
for a brief moment immediately after the meal pipes were lit and the air grew thick with fragrant tobacco smoke
on a corner of the diningroom table a game of poker was begun
one of the drivers a swede produced an accordion a group on the steps of the bunkhouse listened with alternate gravity and shouts of laughter to the acknowledged storyteller of the gang
but soon the men began to turn in stretching themselves at full length on the horse blankets in the racklike bunks
the sounds of heavy breathing increased steadily lights were put out and before the afterglow had faded from the sky the gang was asleep
vanamee however remained awake
the night was fine warm the sky silvergrey with starlight
by and by there would be a moon
in the first watch after the twilight a faint puff of breeze came up out of the south
from all around the heavy penetrating smell of the newturned earth exhaled steadily into the darkness
after a while when the moon came up he could see the vast brown breast of the earth turn toward it
far off distant objects came into view the giant oak tree at ranch house near the irrigating ditch on los muertos the skeletonlike tower of the windmill on home ranch the clump of willows along broderson creek close to the long trestle and last of all the venerable tower of the mission of san juan on the high ground beyond the creek
thitherward like homing pigeons thoughts turned irresistibly
near to that tower just beyond in the little hollow hidden now from his sight was the seed ranch where angele varian had lived
straining his eyes peering across the intervening levels vanamee fancied he could almost see the line of venerable pear trees in whose shadow she had been accustomed to wait for him
on many such a night as this he had crossed the ranches to find her there
his mind went back to that wonderful time of his life sixteen years before this when angele was alive when they two were involved in the sweet intricacies of a love so fine so pure so marvellous that it seemed to them a miracle a manifestation a thing veritably divine put into the life of them and the hearts of them by god himself
to that they had been born
for this loves sake they had come into the world and the mingling of their lives was to be the perfect life the intended ordained union of the soul of man with the soul of woman indissoluble harmonious as music beautiful beyond all thought a foretaste of heaven a hostage of immortality
no he vanamee could never never forget never was the edge of his grief to lose its sharpness never would the lapse of time blunt the tooth of his pain
once more as he sat there looking off across the ranches his eyes fixed on the ancient campanile of the mission church the anguish that would not die leaped at his throat tearing at his heart shaking him and rending him with a violence as fierce and as profound as if it all had been but yesterday
the ache returned to his heart a physical keen pain his hands gripped tight together twisting interlocked his eyes filled with tears his whole body shaken and riven from head to heel
he had lost her
god had not meant it after all
the whole matter had been a mistake
that vast wonderful love that had come upon them had been only the flimsiest mockery
abruptly vanamee rose
he knew the night that was before him
at intervals throughout the course of his prolonged wanderings in the desert on the mesa deep in the canon lost and forgotten on the flanks of unnamed mountains alone under the stars and under the moons white eye these hours came to him his grief recoiling upon him like the recoil of a vast and terrible engine
then he must fight out the night wrestling with his sorrow praying sometimes incoherent hardly conscious asking why of the night and of the stars
such another night had come to him now
until dawn he knew he must struggle with his grief torn with memories his imagination assaulted with visions of a vanished happiness
if this paroxysm of sorrow was to assail him again that night there was but one place for him to be
he would go to the would see father sarria he would pass the night in the deep shadow of the aged pear trees in the mission garden
he struck out across quien sabe his face the face of an ascetic lean brown infinitely sad set toward the mission church
in about an hour he reached and crossed the road that led northward from guadalajara toward the seed ranch and a little farther on forded broderson creek where it ran through one corner of the mission land
he climbed the hill and halted out of breath from his brisk wall at the end of the colonnade of the mission itself
until this moment vanamee had not trusted himself to see the mission at night
on the occasion of his first daytime visit with presley he had hurried away even before the twilight had set in not daring for the moment to face the crowding phantoms that in his imagination filled the mission garden after dark
in the daylight the place had seemed strange to him
none of his associations with the old building and its surroundings were those of sunlight and brightness
whenever during his long sojourns in the wilderness of the southwest he had called up the picture in the eye of his mind it had always appeared to him in the dim mystery of moonless nights the venerable pear trees black with shadow the fountain a thing to be heard rather than seen
but as yet he had not entered the garden
that lay on the other side of the mission
vanamee passed down the colonnade with its uneven pavement of worn red bricks to the last door by the belfry tower and rang the little bell by pulling the leather thong that hung from a hole in the door above the knob
but the maidservant who after a long interval opened the door blinking and confused at being roused from her sleep told vanamee that sarria was not in his room
vanamee however was known to her as the priests protege and great friend and she allowed him to enter telling him that no doubt he would find sarria in the church itself
the servant led the way down the cool adobe passage to a larger room that occupied the entire width of the bottom of the belfry tower and whence a flight of aged steps led upward into the dark
at the foot of the stairs was a door opening into the church
the servant admitted vanamee closing the door behind her
the interior of the mission a great oblong of whitewashed adobe with a flat ceiling was lighted dimly by the sanctuary lamp that hung from three long chains just over the chancel rail at the far end of the church and by two or three cheap kerosene lamps in brackets of imitation bronze
all around the walls was the inevitable series of pictures representing the stations of the cross
they were of a hideous crudity of design and composition yet were wrought out with an innocent unquestioning sincerity that was not without its charm
each picture framed alike in gilt bore its suitable inscription in staring black letters
simon the cyrenean helps jesus to carry his cross
saint veronica wipes the face of jesus
jesus falls for the fourth time and so on up the length of the church the pews began coffinlike boxes of blackened oak shining from years of friction each with its door while over them and built out from the wall was the pulpit with its tarnished gilt soundingboard above it like the raised cover of a great hatbox
between the pews in the aisle the violent vermilion of a strip of ingrain carpet assaulted the eye
farther on were the steps to the altar the chancel rail of wormriddled oak the high altar with its napery from the bargain counters of a san francisco store the massive silver candlesticks each as much as one man could lift the gift of a dead spanish queen and last the pictures of the chancel the virgin in a glory a christ in agony on the cross and st john the baptist the patron saint of the mission the san juan bautista of the early days a gaunt grey figure in skins two fingers upraised in the gesture of benediction
the air of the place was cool and damp and heavy with the flat sweet scent of stale incense smoke
it was of a vaultlike stillness and the closing of the door behind vanamee reechoed from corner to corner with a prolonged reverberation of thunder
however father sarria was not in the church
vanamee took a couple of turns the length of the aisle looking about into the chapels on either side of the chancel
but the building was deserted
the priest had been there recently nevertheless for the altar furniture was in disarray as though he had been rearranging it but a moment before
on both sides of the church and halfway up their length the walls were pierced by low archways in which were massive wooden doors clamped with iron bolts
one of these doors on the pulpit side of the church stood ajar and stepping to it and pushing it wide open vanamee looked diagonally across a little patch of vegetablesbeets radishes and the rear of the building that had once contained the cloisters and through an open window saw father sarria diligently polishing the silver crucifix that usually stood on the high altar
vanamee did not call to the priest
putting a finger to either temple he fixed his eyes steadily upon him for a moment as he moved about at his work
in a few seconds he closed his eyes but only part way
the pupils contracted his forehead lowered to an expression of poignant intensity
soon afterward he saw the priest pause abruptly in the act of drawing the cover over the crucifix looking about him from side to side
he turned again to his work and again came to a stop perplexed curious
with uncertain steps and evidently wondering why he did so he came to the door of the room and opened it looking out into the night
vanamee hidden in the deep shadow of the archway did not move but his eyes closed and the intense expression deepened on his face
the priest hesitated moved forward a step turned back paused again then came straight across the garden patch brusquely colliding with vanamee still motionless in the recess of the archway
sarria gave a great start catching his breath its you
was it you i heard calling
no i could not have remember now
what a strange power
i am not sure that it is right to do this thing vanamee to come
i do not know why
it is a great donot like it
vanamee sometimes it frightens me
vanamee put his chin in the air
if i had wanted to sir i could have made you come to me from back there in the quien sabe ranch
the priest shook his head
it troubles me he said to think that my own will can count for so little
just now i could not resist
if a deep river had been between us i must have crossed it
suppose i had been asleep now
it would have been all the easier answered vanamee understand as little of these things as you
but i think if you had been asleep your power of resistance would have been so much the more weakened
perhaps i should not have waked
perhaps i should have come to you in my sleep
perhaps
sarria crossed himself
it is occult he hazarded
no i do not like it
dear fellow he put his hand on shoulder me that way again promise
see he held out his hand am all of a tremble
there we wonot speak of it further
wait for me a moment
i have only to put the cross in its place and a fresh altar cloth and then i am done is the feast of the holy cross and i am preparing against it
the night is fine
we will smoke a cigar in the cloister garden
a few moments later the two passed out of the door on the other side of the church opposite the pulpit sarria adjusting a silk skull cap on his tonsured head
he wore his cassock now and was far more the churchman in appearance than when vanamee and presley had seen him on a former occasion
they were now in the cloister garden
the place was charming
everywhere grew clumps of palms and magnolia trees
a grapevine over a century old occupied a trellis in one angle of the walls which surrounded the garden on two sides
along the third side was the church itself while the fourth was open the wall having crumbled away its site marked only by a line of eight great pear trees older even than the grapevine gnarled twisted bearing no fruit
directly opposite the pear trees in the south wall of the garden was a round arched portal whose gate giving upon the esplanade in front of the mission was always closed
small gravelled walks well kept bordered with mignonette twisted about among the flower beds and underneath the magnolia trees
in the centre was a little fountain in a stone basin green with moss while just beyond between the fountain and the pear trees stood what was left of a sun dial the bronze gnomon green with the beatings of the weather the figures on the halfcircle of the dial worn away illegible
but on the other side of the fountain and directly opposite the door of the mission ranged against the wall were nine with headstones the rest with slabs
two of predecessors were buried here three of the graves were those of mission indians
one was thought to contain a former alcalde of guadalajara two more held the bodies of de la cuesta and his young wife taking with her to the grave the illusion of her husbands love and the last one the ninth at the end of the line nearest the pear trees was marked by a little headstone the smallest of any on which together with the proper sixteen years cut the name angele varian
but the quiet the repose the isolation of the little cloister garden was infinitely delicious
it was a tiny corner of the great valley that stretched in all directions around off discreet romantic a garden of dreams of enchantments of illusions
outside there far off the great grim world went clashing through its grooves but in here never an echo of the grinding of its wheels entered to jar upon the subdued modulation of the fountains uninterrupted murmur
sarria and vanamee found their way to a stone bench against the side wall of the mission near the door from which they had just issued and sat down sarria lighting a cigar vanamee rolling and smoking cigarettes in mexican fashion
all about them widened the vast calm night
all the stars were out
the moon was coming up
there was no wind no sound
the insistent flowing of the fountain seemed only as the symbol of the passing of time a thing that was understood rather than heard inevitable prolonged
at long intervals a faint breeze hardly more than a breath found its way into the garden over the enclosing walls and passed overhead spreading everywhere the delicious mingled perfume of magnolia blossoms of mignonette of moss of grass and all the calm green life silently teeming within the enclosure of the walls
from where he sat vanamee turning his head could look out underneath the pear trees to the north
close at hand a little valley lay between the high ground on which the mission was built and the line of low hills just beyond broderson creek on the quien sabe
in here was the seed ranch which people had cultivated a unique and beautiful stretch of five hundred acres planted thick with roses violets lilies tulips iris carnations tuberoses poppies manner and description of flowers five hundred acres of them solid thick exuberant blooming and fading and leaving their seed or slips to be marketed broadcast all over the united states
this had been the vocation of flowers for their seeds
all over the country the seed ranch was known
now it was arid almost dry but when in full flower toward the middle of summer the sight of these halfthousand acres royal with colourvermilion azure flaming a marvel
when an east wind blew men on the streets of bonneville nearly twelve miles away could catch the scent of this valley of flowers this chaos of perfume
and into this life of flowers this world of colour this atmosphere oppressive and clogged and cloyed and thickened with sweet odour angele had been born
there she had lived her sixteen years
there she had died
it was not surprising that vanamee with his intense delicate sensitiveness to beauty his almost abnormal capacity for great happiness had been drawn to her had loved her so deeply
she came to him from out of the flowers the smell of the roses in her hair of gold that hung in two straight plaits on either side of her face the reflection of the violets in the profound dark blue of her eyes perplexing heavylidded almondshaped oriental the aroma and the imperial red of the carnations in her lips with their almost egyptian fulness the whiteness of the lilies the perfume of the lilies and the lilies slender balancing grace in her neck
her hands disengaged the odour of the heliotropes
the folds of her dress gave off the enervating scent of poppies
her feet were redolent of hyacinths
for a long time after sitting down upon the bench neither the priest nor vanamee spoke
but after a while sarria took his cigar from his lips saying how still it is
this is a beautiful old garden peaceful very quiet
some day i shall be buried here
i like to remember that and you too vanamee
quien sabe
yes you too
where else
no it is better here yonder by the side of the little girl am not able to look forward yet sir
the things that are to be are somehow nothing to me at all
for me they amount to nothing
they amount to everything my boy
yes to one part of me but not to the part of me that belonged to best part
oh you donot know he exclaimed with a sudden movement no one can understand
what is it to me when you tell me that sometime after i shall die too somewhere in a vague place you call heaven i shall see her again
do you think that the idea of that ever made any ones sorrow easier to bear
ever took the edge from any ones grief
but you believe that oh believe believe echoed the other
what do i believe
i donot know
i believe or i donot believe
i can remember what she but i cannot hope what she will be
hope after all is only memory seen reversed
when i try to see her in another you call the vague place of yours when i try to see her there she comes to my imagination only as what she was material earthly as i loved her
imperfect you say but that is as i saw her and as i saw her i loved her and as she material earthly imperfect she loved me that that i want he exclaimed donot want her changed
i donot want her spiritualised exalted glorified celestial
i want i think it is only this feeling that has kept me from killing myself
i would rather be unhappy in the memory of what she actually was than be happy in the realisation of her transformed changed made celestial
i am only human
her soul
that was beautiful no doubt
but again it was something very vague intangible hardly more than a phrase
but the touch of her hand was real the sound of her voice was real the clasp of her arms about my neck was real
oh he cried shaken with a sudden wrench of passion give those back to me
tell your god to give those back to sound of her voice the touch of her hand the clasp of her dear arms and then you may talk to me of heaven
sarria shook his head
but when you meet her again he observed in heaven you too will be changed
you will see her spiritualised with spiritual eyes
as she is now she does not appeal to you
i understand that
it is because as you say you are only human while she is divine
but when you come to be like her as she is now you will know her as she really is not as she seemed to be because her voice was sweet because her hair was pretty because her hand was warm in yours
vanamee your talk is that of a foolish child
you are like one of the corinthians to whom paul wrote
do you remember
listen now
i can recall the words and such words beautiful and terrible at the same time such a majesty
they march like soldiers with trumpets
but some man will you have said just are the dead raised up
and with what body do they come
thou fool
that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain
it may chance of wheat or of some other grain
but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body
it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body
it is because you are a natural body that you cannot understand her nor wish for her as a spiritual body but when you are both spiritual then you shall know each other as you as you never knew before
your grain of wheat is your symbol of immortality
you bury it in the earth
it dies and rises again a thousand times more beautiful
vanamee your dear girl was only a grain of humanity that we have buried here and the end is not yet
but all this is so old so old
the world learned it a thousand years ago and yet each man that has ever stood by the open grave of any one he loved must learn it all over again from the beginning
vanamee was silent for a moment looking off with unseeing eyes between the trunks of the pear trees over the little valley
that may all be as you say he answered after a while have not learned it yet in any case
now i only know that i love heroh as if it all were that i am suffering suffering always
he leaned forward his head supported on his clenched fists the infinite sadness of his face deepening like a shadow the tears brimming in his deepset eyes
a question that he must ask which involved the thing that was scarcely to be thought of occurred to him at this moment
after hesitating for a long moment he said have been away a long time and i have had no news of this place since i left
is there anything to tell father
has any discovery been made any suspicion developed as other
the priest shook his head
not a word not a whisper
it is a mystery
it always will be
vanamee clasped his head between his clenched fists rocking himself to and fro
oh the terror of it he murmured
the horror of it
and of it sarria only sixteen a little girl so innocent that she never knew what wrong meant pure as a little child is pure who believed that all things were good mature only in her love
and to be struck down like that while your god looked down from heaven and would not take her part
all at once he seemed to lose control of himself
one of those furies of impotent grief and wrath that assailed him from time to time blind insensate incoherent suddenly took possession of him
a torrent of words issued from his lips and he flung out an arm the fist clenched in a fierce quick gesture partly of despair partly of defiance partly of supplication
no your god would not take her part
where was mercy in that
where was protection in that
where was the loving kindness you preach about
why did god give her life if it was to be stamped out
why did god give her the power of love if it was to come to nothing
sarria listen to me
why did god make her so divinely pure if he permitted that abomination
ha he exclaimed bitterly your god
why an apache buck would have been more merciful
your god
there is no god
there is only the devil
the heaven you pray to is only a joke a wretched trick a delusion
it is only hell that is real
sarria caught him by the arm
you are a fool and a child he exclaimed and it is blasphemy that you are saying
i forbid it
you understand
i forbid it
vanamee turned on him with a sudden cry
then tell your god to give her back to me
sarria started away from him his eyes widening in astonishment surprised out of all composure by the others outburst swarthy face was pale the sunken cheeks and deepset eyes were marked with great black shadows
the priest no longer recognised him
the face that face of the ascetic lean framed in its long black hair and pointed beard was quivering with the excitement of hallucination
it was the face of the inspired shepherds of the hebraic legends living close to nature the younger prophets of israel dwellers in the wilderness solitary imaginative believing in the vision having strange delusions gifted with strange powers
in a brief second of thought sarria understood
out into the wilderness the vast arid desert of the southwest vanamee had carried his grief
for days for weeks months even he had been alone a solitary speck lost in the immensity of the horizons continually he was brooding haunted with his sorrow thinking thinking often hard put to it for food
the body was illnourished and the mind concentrated forever upon one subject had recoiled upon itself had preyed upon the naturally nervous temperament till the imagination had become exalted morbidly active diseased beset with hallucinations forever in search of the manifestation of the miracle
it was small wonder that bringing a fancy so distorted back to the scene of a vanished happiness vanamee should be racked with the most violent illusions beset in the throes of a veritable hysteria
tell your god to give her back to me he repeated with fierce insistence
it was the pitch of mysticism the imagination harassed and goaded beyond the normal round suddenly flipping from the circumference spinning off at a tangent out into the void where all things seemed possible hurtling through the dark there groping for the supernatural clamouring for the miracle
and it was also the human natural protest against the inevitable the irrevocable the spasm of revolt under the sting of death the rebellion of the soul at the victory of the grave
he can give her back to me if he only will vanamee cried
sarria you must help me
i tell warn you sir i canot last much longer under it
my head is all wrong with no more hold on my mind
something must happen or i shall lose my senses
i am breaking down under it all my body and my mind alike
bring her to me make god show her to me
if all tales are true it would not be the first time
if i cannot have her at least let me see her as she was real earthly not her spirit her ghost
i want her real self undefiled again
if this is dementia then let me be demented
but help me you and your god create the delusion do the miracle
stop cried the priest again shaking him roughly by the shoulder
stop
be yourself
this is dementia but i shall let you be demented
think of what you are saying
bring her back to you
is that the way of god
i thought you were a man this is the talk of a weakminded girl
vanamee stirred abruptly in his place drawing a long breath and looking about him vaguely as if he came to himself
you are right he muttered hardly know what i am saying at times
but there are moments when my whole mind and soul seem to rise up in rebellion against what has happened when it seems to me that i am stronger than death and that if i only knew how to use the strength of my will concentrate my power of i donot call her backbutsomething diseased and distorted mind is capable of hallucinations if that is what you mean observed sarria
perhaps that is what i mean
perhaps i want only the delusion after all
sarria did not reply and there was a long silence
in the damp south corners of the walls a frog began to croak at exact intervals
the little fountain rippled monotonously and a magnolia flower dropped from one of the trees falling straight as a plummet through the motionless air and settling upon the gravelled walk with a faint rustling sound
otherwise the stillness was profound
a little later the priests cigar long since out slipped from his fingers to the ground
he began to nod gently
vanamee touched his arm
asleep sir
the other started rubbing his eyes
upon my word i believe i was
better go to bed sir
i am not tired
i think i shall sit out here a little longer
well perhaps i would be better off in bed bed is always ready for you here whenever you want to use it shall go back to quien sir my boy
vanamee was left alone
for a long time he sat motionless in his place his elbows on his knees his chin propped in his hands
the minutes the hours
the moon climbed steadily higher among the stars
vanamee rolled and smoked cigarette after cigarette the blue haze of smoke hanging motionless above his head or drifting in slowly weaving filaments across the open spaces of the garden
but the influence of the old enclosure this corner of romance and mystery this isolated garden of dreams savouring of the past with its legends its graves its crumbling sun dial its fountain with its rime of moss was not to be resisted
now that the priest had left him the same exaltation of spirit that had seized upon vanamee earlier in the evening by degrees grew big again in his mind and imagination
his sorrow assaulted him like the flagellations of a fine whiplash and his love for angele rose again in his heart it seemed to him never so deep so tender so infinitely strong
no doubt it was his familiarity with the mission garden his clearcut remembrance of it as it was in the days when he had met angele there tallying now so exactly with the reality there under his eyes that brought her to his imagination so vividly
as yet he dared not trust himself near her grave but for the moment he rose and his hands clasped behind him walked slowly from point to point amid the tiny gravelled walks recalling the incidents of eighteen years ago
on the bench he had quitted he and angele had often sat
here by the crumbling sun dial he recalled the night when he had kissed her for the first time
here again by the rim of the fountain with its fringe of green she once had paused and baring her arm to the shoulder had thrust it deep into the water and then withdrawing it had given it to him to kiss all wet and cool and here at last under the shadow of the pear trees they had sat evening after evening looking off over the little valley below them watching the night build itself domelike from horizon to zenith
brusquely vanamee turned away from the prospect
the seed ranch was dark at this time of the year and flowerless
far off toward its centre he had caught a brief glimpse of the house where angele had lived and a faint light burning in its window
but he turned from it sharply
the deepseated travail of his grief abruptly reached the paroxysm
with long strides he crossed the garden and reentered the mission church itself plunging into the coolness of its atmosphere as into a bath
what he searched for he did not know or rather did not define
he knew only that he was suffering that a longing for angele for some object around which his great love could enfold itself was tearing at his heart with iron teeth
he was ready to be deluded craved the hallucination begged pitifully for the illusion anything rather than the empty tenantless night the voiceless silence the vast loneliness of the overspanning arc of the heavens
before the chancel rail of the altar under the sanctuary lamp vanamee sank upon his knees his arms folded upon the rail his head bowed down upon them
he prayed with what words he could not say for what he did not help merely for relief for an answer to his cry
it was upon that at length that his disordered mind concentrated itself an demanded he implored an answer
not a vague visitation of grace not a formless sense of peace but an answer something real even if the reality were fancied a voice out of the night responding to his a hand in the dark clasping his groping fingers a breath human warm fragrant familiar like a soft sweet caress on his shrunken cheeks
alone there in the dim halflight of the decaying mission with its crumbling plaster its naive crudity of ornament and picture he wrestled fiercely with his desireswords fragments of sentences inarticulate incoherent wrenched from his tightshut teeth
but the answer was not in the church
above him over the high altar the virgin in a glory with downcast eyes and folded hands grew vague and indistinct in the shadow the colours fading tarnished by centuries of incense smoke
the christ in agony on the cross was but a lamentable vision of tormented anatomy grey flesh spotted with crimson
the st john the san juan bautista patron saint of the mission the gaunt figure in skins two fingers upraised in the gesture of benediction gazed stolidly out into the halfgloom under the ceiling ignoring the human distress that beat itself in vain against the altar rail below and angele remained as a memory far distant intangible lost
vanamee rose turning his back upon the altar with a vague gesture of despair
he crossed the church and issuing from the lowarched door opposite the pulpit once more stepped out into the garden
here at least was reality
the warm still air descended upon him like a cloak grateful comforting dispelling the chill that lurked in the damp mould of plaster and crumbling adobe
but now he found his way across the garden on the other side of the fountain where ranged against the eastern wall were nine graves
here angele was buried in the smallest grave of them all marked by the little headstone with its two dates only sixteen years apart
to this spot at last he had returned after the years spent in the desert the all the wanderings of the long trail
here if ever he must have a sense of her nearness
close at hand a short four feet under that mound of grass was the form he had so often held in the embrace of his arms the face the very face he had kissed that face with the hair of gold making threecornered the round white forehead the violetblue eyes heavylidded with their strange oriental slant upward toward the temples the sweet full lips almost egyptian in their that strange perplexing wonderful beauty so troublous so enchanting so out of all accepted standards
he bent down dropping upon one knee a hand upon the headstone and read again the inscription
then instinctively his hand left the stone and rested upon the low mound of turf touching it with the softness of a caress and then before he was aware of it he was stretched at full length upon the earth beside the grave his arms about the low mound his lips pressed against the grass with which it was covered
the pentup grief of nearly twenty years rose again within his heart and overflowed irresistible violent passionate
there was no one to see no one to hear
vanamee had no thought of restraint
he no longer wrestled with his against it
there was even a sense of relief in permitting himself to be overcome
but the reaction from this outburst was equally violent
his revolt against the inevitable his protest against the grave shook him from head to foot goaded him beyond all bounds of reason hounded him on and into the domain of hysteria dementia
vanamee was no longer master of longer knew what he was doing
at first he had been content with merely a wild unreasoned cry to heaven that angele should be restored to him but the vast egotism that seems to run through all forms of disordered intelligence gave his fancy another turn
he forgot god
he no longer reckoned with heaven
he arrogated their powers to to be of his own unaided might stronger than death more powerful than the grave
he had demanded of sarria that god should restore angele to him but now he appealed directly to angele herself
as he lay there his arms clasped about her grave she seemed so near to him that he fancied she hear
and suddenly at this moment his recollection of his strange compelling same power by which he had called presley to him halfway across the quien sabe ranch the same power which had brought sarria to his side that very to him
concentrating his mind upon the one object with which it had so long been filled vanamee his eyes closed his face buried in his arms exclaimed come to you hear
come to me
but the answer was not in the grave
below him the voiceless earth lay silent moveless withholding the secret jealous of that which it held so close in its grip refusing to give up that which had been confided to its keeping untouched by the human anguish that above there on its surface clutched with despairing hands at a grave long made
the earth that only that morning had been so eager so responsive to the lightest summons so vibrant with life now at night holding death within its embrace guarding inviolate the secret of the grave was deaf to all entreaty refused the answer and angele remained as before only a memory far distant intangible lost
vanamee lifted his head looking about him with unseeing eyes trembling with the exertion of his vain effort
but he could not as yet allow himself to despair
never before had that curious power of attraction failed him
he felt himself to be so strong in this respect that he was persuaded if he exerted himself to the limit of his capacity could not say come of it
if it was only a selfdelusion an hallucination he told himself that he would be content
almost of its own accord his distorted mind concentrated itself again every thought all the power of his will riveting themselves upon angele
as if she were alive he summoned her to him
his eyes fixed upon the name cut into the headstone contracted the pupils growing small his fists shut tight his nerves braced rigid
for a few seconds he stood thus breathless expectant awaiting the manifestation the miracle
then without knowing why hardly conscious of what was transpiring he found that his glance was leaving the headstone was turning from the grave
not only this but his whole body was following the direction of his eyes
before he knew it he was standing with his back to grave was facing the north facing the line of pear trees and the little valley where the seed ranch lay
at first he thought this was because he had allowed his will to weaken the concentrated power of his mind to grow slack
and once more turning toward the grave he banded all his thoughts together in a consummate effort his teeth grinding together his hands pressed to his forehead
he forced himself to the notion that angele was alive and to this creature of his imagination he addressed himself angele he cried in a low voice angele i am calling you hear
come to to me now now
instead of the answer he demanded that inexplicable counterinfluence cut across the current of his thought
strive as he would against it he must veer to the north toward the pear trees
obeying it he turned and still wondering took a step in that direction then another and another
the next moment he came abruptly to himself in the black shadow of the pear trees themselves and opening his eyes found himself looking off over the seed ranch toward the little house in the centre where angele had once lived
perplexed he returned to the grave once more calling upon the resources of his will and abruptly so soon as these reached a certain point the same crosscurrent set in
he could no longer keep his eyes upon the headstone could no longer think of the grave and what it held
he must face the north he must be drawn toward the pear trees and there left standing in their shadow looking out aimlessly over the seed ranch wondering bewildered
farther than this the influence never drew him but up to this line of pear was not to be resisted
for a time the peculiarity of the affair was of more interest to vanamee than even his own distress of spirit and once or twice he repeated the attempt almost experimentally and invariably with the same result so soon as he seemed to hold angele in the grip of his mind he was moved to turn about toward the north and hurry toward the pear trees on the crest of the hill that overlooked the little valley
but unhappiness was too keen this night for him to dwell long upon the vagaries of his mind
submitting at length and abandoning the grave he flung himself down in the black shade of the pear trees his chin in his hands and resigned himself finally and definitely to the inrush of recollection and the exquisite grief of an infinite regret
to his fancy she came to him again
he put himself back many years
he remembered the warm nights of july and august profoundly still the sky encrusted with stars the little mission garden exhaling the mingled perfumes that all through the scorching day had been distilled under the steady blaze of a summers sun
he saw himself as another person arriving at this their rendezvous
all day long she had been in his mind
all day long he had looked forward to this quiet hour that belonged to her
it was dark
he could see nothing but by and by he heard a step a gentle rustle of the grass on the slope of the hill pressed under an advancing foot
then he saw the faint gleam of pallid gold of her hair a barely visible glow in the starlight and heard the murmur of her breath in the lapse of the overpassing breeze
and then in the midst of the gentle perfumes of the garden the perfumes of the magnolia flowers of the mignonette borders of the crumbling walls there expanded a new odour or the faint mingling of many odours the smell of the roses that lingered in her hair of the lilies that exhaled from her neck of the heliotrope that disengaged itself from her hands and arms and of the hyacinths with which her little feet were redolent and then suddenly it was eyes heavylidded violet blue full of the love of him her sweet full lips speaking his name her hands clasping his hands his shoulders his whole dear body giving itself into his embrace her lips against his her hands holding his head drawing his face down to hers
vanamee as he remembered all this flung out an arm with a cry of pain his eyes searching the gloom all his mind in strenuous mutiny against the triumph of death
his glance shot swiftly out across the night unconsciously following the direction from which angele used to come to him
come to me now he exclaimed under his breath tense and rigid with the vast futile effort of his will
come to me now now you hear me angele
you must you must come
suddenly vanamee returned to himself with the abruptness of a blow
his eyes opened
he half raised himself from the ground
swiftly his scattered wits readjusted themselves
never more sane never more himself he rose to his feet and stood looking off into the night across the seed ranch
what was it he murmured bewildered
he looked around him from side to side as if to get in touch with reality once more
he looked at his hands at the rough bark of the pear tree next which he stood at the streaked and raineroded walls of the mission and garden
the exaltation of his mind calmed itself the unnatural strain under which he laboured slackened
he became thoroughly master of himself again matteroffact practical keen
but just so sure as his hands were his own just so sure as the bark of the pear tree was rough the mouldering adobe of the mission walls so sure had something occurred
it was vague intangible appealing only to some strange nameless sixth sense but none the less perceptible
his mind his imagination sent out from him across the night across the little valley below him speeding hither and thither through the dark lost confused had suddenly paused hovering had found something
it had not returned to him emptyhanded
it had come back but now there was a changemysterious illusive
there were no words for this that had transpired
but for the moment one thing only was certain
the night was no longer voiceless the dark was no longer empty
far off there beyond the reach of vision unlocalised strange a ripple had formed on the still black pool of the night had formed flashed one instant to the stars then swiftly faded again
the night shut down once more
there was no stirred
for the moment vanamee stood transfixed struck rigid in his place stupefied his eyes staring breathless with utter amazement
then step by step he shrank back into the deeper shadow treading with the infinite precaution of a prowling leopard
a qualm of something very much like fear seized upon him
but immediately on the heels of this first impression came the doubt of his own senses
whatever had happened had been so ephemeral so faint so intangible that now he wondered if he had not deceived himself after all
but the reaction followed
surely there had been something
and from that moment began for him the most poignant uncertainty of mind
gradually he drew back into the garden holding his breath listening to every faintest sound walking upon tiptoe
he reached the fountain and wetting his hands passed them across his forehead and eyes
once more he stood listening
the silence was profound
troubled disturbed vanamee went away passing out of the garden descending the hill
he forded broderson creek where it intersected the road to guadalajara and went on across quien sabe walking slowly his head bent down his hands clasped behind his back thoughtful perplexed
at seven oclock in the bedroom of his ranch house in the whitepainted iron bedstead with its bluegrey army blankets and red counterpane annixter was still asleep his face red his mouth open his stiff yellow hair in wild disorder
on the wooden chair at the bedhead stood the kerosene lamp by the light of which he had been reading the previous evening
beside it was a paper bag of dried prunes and the limp volume of copperfield the place marked by a slip of paper torn from the edge of the bag
annixter slept soundly making great work of the business unable to take even his rest gracefully
his eyes were shut so tight that the skin at their angles was drawn into puckers
under his pillow his two hands were doubled up into fists
at intervals he gritted his teeth ferociously while from time to time the abrupt sound of his snoring dominated the brisk ticking of the alarm clock that hung from the brass knob of the bedpost within six inches of his ear
but immediately after seven this clock sprung its alarm with the abruptness of an explosion and within the second annixter had hurled the bedclothes from him and flung himself up to a sitting posture on the edge of the bed panting and gasping blinking at the light rubbing his head dazed and bewildered stupefied at the hideous suddenness with which he had been wrenched from his sleep
his first act was to take down the alarm clock and stifle its prolonged whirring under the pillows and blankets
but when this had been done he continued to sit stupidly on the edge of the bed curling his toes away from the cold of the floor his halfshut eyes heavy with sleep fixed and vacant closing and opening by turns
for upwards of three minutes he alternately dozed and woke his head and the whole upper half of his body sagging abruptly sideways from moment to moment
but at length coming more to himself he straightened up ran his fingers through his hair and with a prodigious yawn murmured vaguely oh lord
he stretched three or four times twisting about in his place curling and uncurling his toes muttering from time to time between two yawns oh lord
oh lord
he stared about the room collecting his thoughts readjusting himself for the days work
the room was barren the walls of brown and yellow the walls of a stable were adorned with two or three unframed lithographs the christmas souvenirs of weekly periodicals fastened with great wire nails a bunch of herbs or flowers lamentably withered and grey with dust was affixed to the mirror over the black walnut washstand by the window and a yellowed photograph of combined and his men in a group before close at hand
on the floor at the bedside and before the bureau were two oval ragcarpet rugs
in the corners of the room were muddy boots a saddle a surveyors transit an empty coalhod and a box of iron bolts and nuts
on the wall over the bed in a gilt frame was college diploma while on the bureau amid a litter of hairbrushes dirty collars driving gloves cigars and the like stood a broken machine for loading shells
it was essentially a mans room rugged uncouth virile full of the odours of tobacco of leather of rusty iron the bare floor hollowed by the grind of hobnailed boots the walls marred by the friction of heavy things of metal
strangely enough clothes were disposed of on the single chair with the precision of an old maid
thus he had placed them the night before the boots set carefully side by side the trousers with the overalls still upon them neatly folded upon the seat of the chair the coat hanging from its back
the quien sabe ranch house was a sixroom affair all on one floor
by no excess of charity could it have been called a home
annixter was a wealthy man he could have furnished his dwelling with quite as much elegance as that of magnus derrick
as it was however he considered his house merely as a place to eat to sleep to change his clothes in as a shelter from the rain an office where business was more
when he was sufficiently awake annixter thrust his feet into a pair of wicker slippers and shuffled across the office adjoining his bedroom to the bathroom just beyond and stood under the icy shower a few minutes his teeth chattering fulminating oaths at the coldness of the water
still shivering he hurried into his clothes and having pushed the button of the electric bell to announce that he was ready for breakfast immediately plunged into the business of the day
while he was thus occupied the butchers cart from bonneville drove into the yard with the days supply of meat
this cart also brought the bonneville paper and the mail of the previous night
in the bundle of correspondence that the butcher handed to annixter that morning was a telegram from osterman at that time on his second trip to los angeles
it read flotation of company in this district assured
have secured services of desirable party
am now in position to sell you your share stock as per original plan
annixter grunted as he tore the despatch into strips
well he muttered that part is settled then
he made a little pile of the torn strips on the top of the unlighted stove and burned them carefully scowling down into the flicker of fire thoughtful and preoccupied
he knew very well what osterman referred to by flotation of company and also who was the desirable party he spoke of
under protest as he was particular to declare and after interminable argument annixter had allowed himself to be reconciled with osterman and to be persuaded to reenter the proposed political deal
a committee had been formed to finance the old broderson annixter himself and with reservations hardly more than a lookeron harran derrick
of this committee osterman was considered chairman
magnus derrick had formally and definitely refused his adherence to the scheme
he was trying to steer a middle course
his position was difficult anomalous
if freight rates were cut through the efforts of the members of the committee he could not very well avoid taking advantage of the new schedule
he would be the gainer though sharing neither the risk nor the expense
but meanwhile the days were passing the primary elections were drawing nearer
the committee could not afford to wait and by way of a beginning osterman had gone to los angeles fortified by a large sum of purse to which annixter broderson and himself had contributed
he had put himself in touch with disbrow the political man of the denver pueblo and mojave road and had had two interviews with him
the telegram that annixter received that morning was to say that disbrow had been bought over and would adopt parrell as the and candidate for railroad commissioner from the third district
one of the cooks brought up breakfast that morning and he went through it hastily reading his mail at the same time and glancing over the pages of the mercury paper
the mercury annixter was persuaded received a subsidy from the pacific and southwestern railroad and was hardly better than the mouthpiece by which shelgrim and the general office spoke to ranchers about bonneville
an editorial in that mornings issue said it would not be surprising to the wellinformed if the longdeferred regrade of the value of the railroad sections included in the los muertos quien sabe osterman and broderson properties was made before the first of the year
naturally the tenants of these lands feel an interest in the price which the railroad will put upon its holdings and it is rumoured they expect the land will be offered to them for two dollars and fifty cents per acre
it needs no seventh daughter of a seventh daughter to foresee that these gentlemen will be disappointed
rot vociferated annixter to himself as he finished
he rolled the paper into a wad and hurled it from him
rot rot
what does genslinger know about it
i stand on my agreement with the and two fifty to five dollars an it is in black and white
the road obligated
and my improvements
i made the land valuable by improving it irrigating it draining it and cultivating it
talk to i know better
the most abiding impression that editorial made upon him was that possibly the mercury was not subsidised by the corporation after all
if it was genslinger would not have been led into making his mistake as to the value of the land
he would have known that the railroad was under contract to sell at two dollars and a half an acre and not only this but that when the land was put upon the market it was to be offered to the present holders first of all
annixter called to mind the explicit terms of the agreement between himself and the railroad and dismissed the matter from his mind
he lit a cigar put on his hat and went out
the morning was fine the air nimble brisk
on the summit of the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well the windmill was turning steadily in a breeze from the southwest
the water in the irrigating ditch was well up
there was no cloud in the sky
far off to the east and west the bulwarks of the valley the coast range and the foothills of the sierras stood out pale amethyst against the delicate pink and white sheen of the horizon
the sunlight was a veritable flood crystal limpid sparkling setting a feeling of gayety in the air stirring up an effervescence in the blood a tumult of exuberance in the veins
but on his way to the barns annixter was obliged to pass by the open door of the dairyhouse
hilma tree was inside singing at her work her voice of a velvety huskiness more of the chest than of the throat mingling with the liquid dashing of the milk in the vats and churns and the clear sonorous clinking of the cans and pans
annixter turned into the dairyhouse pausing on the threshold looking about him
hilma stood bathed from head to foot in the torrent of sunlight that poured in upon her from the three wideopen windows
she was charming delicious radiant of youth of health of wellbeing
into her eyes wide open brown rimmed with their fine thin line of intense black lashes the sun set a diamond flash the same golden light glowed all around her thick moist hair lambent beautiful a sheen of almost metallic lustre and reflected itself upon her wet lips moving with the words of her singing
the whiteness of her skin under the caress of this hale vigorous morning light was dazzling pure of a fineness beyond words
beneath the sweet modulation of her chin the reflected light from the burnished copper vessel she was carrying set a vibration of pale gold
overlaying the flush of rose in her cheeks seen only when she stood against the sunlight was a faint sheen of down a lustrous floss delicate as the pollen of a flower or the impalpable powder of a moths wing
she was moving to and fro about her work alert joyous robust and from all the fine full amplitude of her figure from her thick white neck sloping downward to her shoulders from the deep feminine swell of her breast the vigorous maturity of her hips there was disengaged a vibrant note of gayety of exuberant animal life sane honest strong
she wore a skirt of plain blue calico and a shirtwaist of pink linen clean trim while her sleeves turned back to her shoulders showed her large white arms wet with milk redolent and fragrant with milk glowing and resplendent in the early morning light
on the threshold annixter took off his hat
good morning miss hilma
hilma who had set down the copper can on top of the vat turned about quickly
oh morning sir and unconsciously she made a little gesture of salutation with her hand raising it part way toward her head as a man would have done
well began annixter vaguely how are you getting along down here
oh very fine there is not so much to do
we drew the whey hours ago and now we are just done putting the curd to press
i have been cleaning
see my pans they do for mirrors sir
and the copper things
i have scrubbed and scrubbed
oh you can look into the tiniest corners everywhere you wonot find so much as the littlest speck of dirt or grease
i love things and this room is my own particular place
here i can do just as i please and that is to keep the cement floor and the vats and the churns and the separators and especially the cans and coppers clean clean and to see that the milk is pure oh so that a little baby could drink it and to have the air always sweet and the sunoh lots and lots of sun morning noon and afternoon so that everything shines
you know i never see the sun set that it donot make me a little sad yes always just a little it funny
i should want it to be day all the time
and when the day is gloomy and dark i am just as sad as if a very good friend of mine had left me
would you believe it
just until within a few years when i was a big girl sixteen and over mamma had to sit by my bed every night before i could go to sleep
i was afraid in the dark
sometimes i am now
just imagine and now i am young lady
you were hey observed annixter for the sake of saying something
afraid in the dark
what ofghosts
i donot know what
i wanted the light i wanted she drew a deep breath turning towards the window and spreading her pink fingertips to the light
oh the i love the sun
see put your hand on the top of the that it warm it fine
and donot you love to see it coming in like that through the windows floods of it and all the little dust in it shining
where there is lots of sunlight i think the people must be very good only wicked people that love the dark
and the wicked things are always done and planned in the dark i think
perhaps too thats why i hate things that are that i canot see that happen in the dark
she wrinkled her nose with a little expression of aversion hate a mystery
maybe thats why i am afraid in the was
i shouldnot like to think that anything could happen around me that i couldnot see or understand or explain
she ran on from subject to subject positively garrulous talking in her lowpitched voice of velvety huskiness for the mere enjoyment of putting her ideas into speech innocently assuming that they were quite as interesting to others as to herself
she was yet a great child ignoring the fact that she had ever grown up taking a childs interest in her immediate surroundings direct straightforward plain
while speaking she continued about her work rinsing out the cans with a mixture of hot water and soda scouring them bright and piling them in the sunlight on top of the vat
obliquely and from between his narrowed lids annixter scrutinised her from time to time more and more won over by her adorable freshness her clean fine youth
the clumsiness that he usually experienced in the presence of women was wearing off
hilma direct simplicity put him at his ease
he began to wonder if he dared to kiss hilma and if he did dare how she would take it
a spark of suspicion flickered up in his mind
did not her manner imply vaguely an invitation
one never could tell with feemales
that was why she was talking so much no doubt holding him there affording the opportunity
aha
she had best look out or he would take her at her word
oh i had forgotten suddenly exclaimed hilma the very thing i wanted to show new press
you remember i asked for one last month
this is it
see this is how it works
here is where the curds go look
and this cover is screwed down like this and then you work the lever this way
she grasped the lever in both hands throwing her weight upon it her smooth bare arm swelling round and firm with the effort one slim foot in its low shoe set off with the bright steel buckle braced against the wall
my but that takes strength she panted looking up at him and smiling
but isnot it a fine press
just what we needed
and annixter cleared his throat and where do you keep the cheeses and the butter
he thought it very likely that these were in the cellar of the dairy
in the cellar answered hilma
down here see
she raised the flap of the cellar door at the end of the room
would you like to see
come down show you
she went before him down into the cool obscurity underneath redolent of new cheese and fresh butter
annixter followed a certain excitement beginning to gain upon him
he was almost sure now that hilma wanted him to kiss her
at all events one could but try
but as yet he was not absolutely sure
suppose he had been mistaken in her suppose she should consider herself insulted and freeze him with an icy stare
annixter winced at the very thought of it
better let the whole business go and get to work
he was wasting half the morning
yet if she want to give him the opportunity of kissing her and he failed to take advantage of it what a ninny she would think him she would despise him for being afraid
he afraid
he annixter afraid of a fool feemale girl
why he owed it to himself as a man to go as far as he could
he told himself that that goat osterman would have kissed hilma tree weeks ago to test his state of mind he imagined himself as having decided to kiss her after all and at once was surprised to experience a poignant qualm of excitement his heart beating heavily his breath coming short
at the same time his courage remained with him
he was not afraid to try
he felt a greater respect for himself because of this
his selfassurance hardened within him and as hilma turned to him asking him to taste a cut from one of the ripe cheeses he suddenly stepped close to her throwing an arm about her shoulders advancing his head
but at the last second he bungled hesitated hilma shrank from him supple as a young reed annixter clutched harshly at her arm and trod his full weight upon one of her slender feet his cheek and chin barely touching the delicate pink lobe of one of her ears his lips brushing merely a fold of her shirt waist between neck and shoulder
the thing was a failure and at once he realised that nothing had been further from mind than the idea of his kissing her
she started back from him abruptly her hands nervously clasped against her breast drawing in her breath sharply and holding it with a little tremulous catch of the throat that sent a quivering vibration the length of her smooth white neck
her eyes opened wide with a childlike look more of astonishment than anger
she was surprised out of all measure discountenanced taken all aback and when she found her breath gave voice to a great oh of dismay and distress
for an instant annixter stood awkwardly in his place ridiculous clumsy murmuring over and over again all going to hurt you
you neednot be going to hurt all right
then suddenly with a quick indefinite gesture of one arm he exclaimed sorry
he turned away striding up the stairs crossing the dairyroom and regained the open air raging and furious
he turned toward the barns clapping his hat upon his head muttering the while under his breath oh you goat
you beastly fool good what an ass youve made of yourself now
suddenly he resolved to put hilma tree out of his thoughts
the matter was interfering with his work
this kind of thing was sure not earning any money
he shook himself as though freeing his shoulders of an irksome burden and turned his entire attention to the work nearest at hand
the prolonged rattle of the shinglers hammers upon the roof of the big barn attracted him and crossing over between the ranch house and the artesian well he stood for some time absorbed in the contemplation of the vast building amused and interested with the confusion of clatter of hammers the cadenced scrape of saws and the rhythmic shuffle of issued from the gang of carpenters who were at that moment putting the finishing touches upon the roof and rows of stalls
a boy and two men were busy hanging the great sliding door at the south end while the down from bonneville early that engaged in adjusting the spray and force engine by means of which annixter had insisted upon painting the vast surfaces of the barn condemning the use of brushes and pots for such work as oldfashioned and outofdate
he called to one of the foremen to ask when the barn would be entirely finished and was told that at the end of the week the hay and stock could be installed
and a precious long time youve been at it too annixter declared
well you know the rain oh rot the rain
i work in the rain
you and your unions make me sick
but mr annixter we couldnot have begun painting in the rain
the job would have been spoiled
hoh yes spoiled all very well
maybe it would and then again maybe it wouldnot
but when the foreman had left him annixter could not forbear a growl of satisfaction
it could not be denied that the barn was superb monumental even
almost any one of the other barns in the county could be swung birdcage fashion inside of it with room to spare
in every sense the barn was precisely what annixter had hoped of it
in his pleasure over the success of his idea even hilma for the moment was forgotten
and now murmured annixter give that dance in it make em sit up
it occurred to him that he had better set about sending out the invitations for the affair
he was puzzled to decide just how the thing should be managed and resolved that it might be as well to consult magnus and mrs derrick want to talk of this telegram of the goats with magnus anyhow he said to himself reflectively and theres things i got to do in bonneville before the first of the month
he turned about on his heel with a last look at the barn and set off toward the stable
he had decided to have his horse saddled and ride over to bonneville by way of los muertos
he would make a day of it would see magnus harran old broderson and some of the business men of bonneville
a few moments later he rode out of the barn and the stableyard a fresh cigar between his teeth his hat slanted over his face against the rays of the sun as yet low in the east
he crossed the irrigating ditch and gained the short cut over into los muertos by way of it led south and west into the low ground overgrown by greygreen willows by broderson creek at this time of the rainy season a stream of considerable volume farther on dipping sharply to pass underneath the long trestle of the railroad
on the other side of the right of way annixter was obliged to open the gate in line fence
he managed this without dismounting swearing at the horse the while and spurring him continually
but once inside the gate he cantered forward briskly
this part of los muertos was holding some five hundred acres enclosed between the irrigating ditch and broderson creek and half the way across annixter came up with hooven himself busily at work replacing a broken washer in his seeder
upon one of the horses hitched to the machine her hands gripped tightly upon the harness of the collar hilda his little daughter with her small hobnailed boots and boys canvas overalls sat exalted and petrified with ecstasy and excitement her eyes wide opened her hair in a tangle
hello bismarck said annixter drawing up beside him

the seeder advanced whirring
ach hilda leedle girl he cried hold tight bei der shdrap on
hey hoop
gedt oop you
annixter cantered on
in a few moments he had crossed broderson creek and had entered upon the home ranch of los muertos
ahead of him but so far off that the greater portion of its bulk was below the horizon he could see the derricks home a roof or two between the dull green of cypress and eucalyptus
nothing else was in sight
the brown earth smooth unbroken was as a limitless mudcoloured ocean
the silence was profound
then at length searching eye made out a blur on the horizon to the northward the blur concentrated itself to a speck the speck grew by steady degrees to a spot slowly moving a note of dull colour barely darker than the land but an inky black silhouette as it topped a low rise of ground and stood for a moment outlined against the pale blue of the sky
annixter turned his horse from the road and rode across the ranch land to meet this new object of interest
as the spot grew larger it resolved itself into constituents a collection of units its shape grew irregular fragmentary
a disintegrated nebulous confusion advanced toward annixter preceded as he discovered on nearer approach by a medley of faint sounds
now it was no longer a spot but a column a column that moved accompanied by spots
as annixter lessened the distance these spots resolved themselves into buggies or men on horseback that kept pace with the advancing column
there were horses in the column itself
at first glance it appeared as if there were nothing else a riderless squadron tramping steadily over the upturned plough land of the ranch
but it drew nearer
the horses were in lines six abreast harnessed to machines
the noise increased defined itself
there was a shout or two occasionally a horse blew through his nostrils with a prolonged vibrating snort
the click and clink of metal work was incessant the machines throwing off a continual rattle of wheels and cogs and clashing springs
the column approached nearer was close at hand
the noises mingled to a subdued uproar a bewildering confusion the impact of innumerable hoofs was a veritable rumble
machine after machine appeared and annixter drawing to one side remained for nearly ten minutes watching and interested while like an array of chariotsclattering jostling creaking clashing an interminable procession machine succeeding machine sixhorse team succeeding sixhorse teambustling thirtythree grain drills each with its eight hoes went clamouring past like an advance of military seeding the ten thousand acres of the great ranch fecundating the living soil implanting deep in the dark womb of the earth the germ of life the sustenance of a whole world the food of an entire people
when the drills had passed annixter turned and rode back to the lower road over the land now thick with seed
he did not wonder that the seeding on los muertos seemed to be hastily conducted
magnus and harran derrick had not yet been able to make up the time lost at the beginning of the season when they had waited so long for the ploughs to arrive
they had been behindhand all the time
on ranch the land had not only been harrowed as well as seeded but in some cases crossharrowed as well
the labour of putting in the vast crop was over
now there was nothing to do but wait while the seed silently germinated nothing to do but watch for the wheat to come up
when annixter reached the ranch house of los muertos under the shade of the cypress and eucalyptus trees he found mrs derrick on the porch seated in a long wicker chair
she had been washing her hair and the light brown locks that yet retained so much of their brightness were carefully spread in the sun over the back of her chair
annixter could not but remark that spite of her more than fifty years annie derrick was yet rather pretty
her eyes were still those of a young girl just touched with an uncertain expression of innocence and inquiry but as her glance fell upon him he found that that expression changed to one of uneasiness of distrust almost of aversion
the night before this after magnus and his wife had gone to bed they had lain awake for hours staring up into the dark talking talking
magnus had not long been able to keep from his wife the news of the coalition that was forming against the railroad nor the fact that this coalition was determined to gain its ends by any means at its command
he had told her of scheme of a fraudulent election to seat a board of railroad commissioners who should be nominees of the farming interests
magnus and his wife had talked this matter over and over again and the same discussion begun immediately after supper the evening before had lasted till far into the night
at once annie derrick had been seized with a sudden terror lest magnus after all should allow himself to be persuaded should yield to the pressure that was every day growing stronger
none better than she knew the iron integrity of her husbands character
none better than she remembered how his dearest ambition that of political preferment had been thwarted by his refusal to truckle to connive to compromise with his ideas of right
now at last there seemed to be a change
long continued oppression petty tyranny injustice and extortion had driven him to exasperation insults still rankled
he seemed nearly ready to countenance scheme
the very fact that he was willing to talk of it to her so often and at such great length was proof positive that it occupied his mind
the pity of it the tragedy of it
he magnus the governor who had been so staunch so rigidly upright so loyal to his convictions so bitter in his denunciation of the new politics so scathing in his attacks on bribery and corruption in high places was it possible that now at last he could be brought to withhold his condemnation of the devious intrigues of the unscrupulous going on there under his very eyes
that magnus should not command harran to refrain from all intercourse with the conspirators had been a matter of vast surprise to mrs derrick
time was when magnus would have forbidden his son to so much as recognise a dishonourable man
but besides all this wife trembled at the thought of her husband and son engaging in so desperate a grapple with the great monster ironhearted relentless infinitely powerful
always it had issued triumphant from the fight always behrman the champion remained upon the field as victor placid unperturbed unassailable
but now a more terrible struggle than any hitherto loomed menacing over the rim of the future money was to be spent like water personal reputations were to be hazarded in the issue failure meant ruin in all directions financial ruin moral ruin ruin of prestige ruin of character
success to her mind was almost impossible
annie derrick feared the railroad
at night when everything else was still the distant roar of passing trains echoed across los muertos from guadalajara from bonneville or from the long trestle straight into her heart
at such moments she saw very plainly the galloping terror of steam and steel with its single eye cyclopean red shooting from horizon to horizon symbol of a vast power huge and terrible the leviathan with tentacles of steel to oppose which meant to be ground to instant destruction beneath the clashing wheels
no it was better to submit to resign oneself to the inevitable
she obliterated herself shrinking from the harshness of the world striving with vain hands to draw her husband back with her
just before arrival she had been sitting thoughtful in her long chair an open volume of poems turned down upon her lap her glance losing itself in the immensity of los muertos that from the edge of the lawn close by unrolled itself gigantic toward the far southern horizon wrinkled and serrated after the seasons ploughing
the earth hitherto grey with dust was now upturned and brown
as far as the eye could reach it was empty of all life bare mournful absolutely still and as she looked there seemed to her morbid and disturbed with long brooding sick with the monotony of repeated be disengaged from all this immensity a sense of a vast oppression formless disquieting
the terror of sheer bigness grew slowly in her mind loneliness beyond words gradually enveloped her
she was lost in all these limitless reaches of space
had she been abandoned in midocean in an open boat her terror could hardly have been greater
she felt vividly that certain uncongeniality which when all is said forever remains between humanity and the earth which supports it
she recognised the colossal indifference of nature not hostile even kindly and friendly so long as the human antswarm was submissive working with it hurrying along at its side in the mysterious march of the centuries
let however the insect rebel strive to make head against the power of this nature and at once it became relentless a gigantic engine a vast power huge terrible a leviathan with a heart of steel knowing no compunction no forgiveness no tolerance crushing out the human atom with sound less calm the agony of destruction sending never a jar never the faintest tremour through all that prodigious mechanism of wheels and cogs
such thoughts as these did not take shape distinctly in her mind
she could not have told herself exactly what it was that disquieted her
she only received the vague sensation of these things as it were a breath of wind upon her face confused troublous an indefinite sense of hostility in the air
the sound of hoofs grinding upon the gravel of the driveway brought her to herself again and withdrawing her gaze from the empty plain of los muertos she saw young annixter stopping his horse by the carriage steps
but the sight of him only diverted her mind to the other trouble
she could not but regard him with aversion
he was one of the conspirators was one of the leaders in the battle that impended no doubt he had come to make a fresh attempt to win over magnus to the unholy alliance
however there was little trace of enmity in her greeting
her hair was still spread like a broad patch of back and she made that her excuse for not getting up
in answer to embarrassed inquiry after magnus she sent the chinese cook to call him from the office and annixter after tying his horse to the ring driven into the trunk of one of the eucalyptus trees came up to the porch and taking off his hat sat down upon the steps
is harran anywhere about he asked like to see harran too
no said mrs derrick harran went to bonneville early this morning
she glanced toward annixter nervously without turning her head lest she should disturb her outspread hair
what is it you want to see mr derrick about she inquired hastily
is it about this plan to elect a railroad commission
magnus does not approve of it she declared with energy
he told me so last night
annixter moved about awkwardly where he sat smoothing down with his hand the one stiff lock of yellow hair that persistently stood up from his crown like an scalplock
at once his suspicions were all aroused
ah this feemale woman was trying to get a hold on him trying to involve him in a petticoat mess trying to cajole him
upon the instant he became very crafty an excess of prudence promptly congealed his natural impulses
in an actual spasm of caution he scarcely trusted himself to speak terrified lest he should commit himself to something
he glanced about apprehensively praying that magnus might join them speedily relieving the tension came to see about giving a dance in my new barn he answered scowling into the depths of his hat as though reading from notes he had concealed there wanted to ask how i should send out the invites
i thought of just putting an ad in the mercury but as he spoke presley had come up behind annixter in time to get the drift of the conversation and now observed nonsense buck not giving a public ball
you send out invitations
hello presley you there exclaimed annixter turning round
the two shook hands
send out invitations repeated annixter uneasily
why must because thats the only way to do
it is is it answered annixter perplexed and troubled
no other man of his acquaintance could have so contradicted annixter without provoking a quarrel upon the instant
why the young rancher irascible obstinate belligerent should invariably defer to the poet was an inconsistency never to be explained
it was with great surprise that mrs derrick heard him continue well i suppose you know what youre talking about pres
must have written invites hey
of course
typewritten
why what an ass you are buck observed presley calmly
before you get through with it you will probably insult threefourths of the people you intend to invite and have about a hundred quarrels on your hands and a lawsuit or two
however before annixter could reply magnus came out on the porch erect grave freshly shaven
without realising what he was doing annixter instinctively rose to his feet
it was as though magnus was a of an unseen army and he a subaltern
there was some little conversation as to the proposed dance and then annixter found an excuse for drawing the governor aside
mrs derrick watched the two with eyes full of poignant anxiety as they slowly paced the length of the gravel driveway to the road gate and stood there leaning upon it talking earnestly magnus tall thinlipped impassive one hand in the breast of his frock coat his head bare his keen blue eyes fixed upon face
annixter came at once to the main point got a wire from osterman this morning governor and got disbrow
that means that the denver pueblo and mojave is back of us half the fight won first off
osterman bribed him i suppose observed magnus
annixter raised a shoulder vexatiously got to pay for what you get he returned
you donot get something for nothing i guess
governor he went on donot see how you can stay out of this business much longer
you see how it will be going to win and i donot see how you can feel that its right of you to let us do all the work and stand all the expense never been a movement of any importance that went on around you that you werenot the leader in it
all tulare county all the san joaquin for that matter knows you
they want a leader and they are looking to you
i know how you feel about politics nowadays
but governor standards have changed since your time everybody plays the game now as we are playing most honourable men
you canot play it any other way and pshaw if the right wins out in the end thats the main thing
we want you in this thing and we want you bad been chewing on this affair now a long time
have you made up your mind
do you come in
i tell you what youve got to look at these things in a large way got to judge by results
well now what do you think
do you come in glance left face and for an instant sought the ground
his frown lowered but now it was in perplexity rather than in anger
his mind was troubled harassed with a thousand dissensions
but one of strongest instincts one of his keenest desires was to be if only for a short time the master
to control men had ever been his ambition submission of any kind his greatest horror
his energy stirred within him goaded by the lash of his anger his sense of indignity of insult
oh for one moment to be able to strike back to crush his enemy to defeat the railroad hold the corporation in the grip of his fist put down behrman rehabilitate himself regain his selfrespect
to be once more powerful to command to dominate
his thin lips pressed themselves together the nostrils of his prominent hawklike nose dilated his erect commanding figure stiffened unconsciously
for a moment he saw himself controlling the situation the foremost figure in his state feared respected thousands of men beneath him his ambition at length gratified his career once apparently brought to naught completed success a palpable achievement
what if this were his chance after all come at last after all these years
his chance
the instincts of the oldtime gambler the most redoubtable poker player of el dorado county stirred at the word
chance
to know it when it came to recognise it as it passed fleet as a windflurry grip at it catch at it blind reckless staking all upon the hazard of the issue that was genius
was this his chance
all of a sudden it seemed to him that it was
but his honour
his cherished lifelong integrity the unstained purity of his principles
at this late date were they to be sacrificed
could he now go counter to all the firm built fabric of his character
how afterward could he bear to look harran and lyman in the face
and yetand swung the neglect his chance meant failure a life begun in promise and ended in obscurity perhaps in financial ruin poverty even
to seize it meant achievement fame influence prestige possibly great wealth am so sorry to interrupt said mrs derrick as she came up hope mr annixter will excuse me but i want magnus to open the safe for me
i have lost the combination and i must have some money
phelps is going into town and i want him to pay some bills for me you come right away magnus
phelps is ready and waiting
annixter struck his heel into the ground with a suppressed oath
always these fool feemale women came between him and his plans mixing themselves up in his affairs
magnus had been on the very point of saying something perhaps committing himself to some course of action and at precisely the wrong moment his wife had cut in
the opportunity was lost
the three returned toward the ranch house but before saying goodbye annixter had secured from magnus a promise to the effect that before coming to a definite decision in the matter under discussion he would talk further with him
presley met him at the porch
he was going into town with phelps and proposed to annixter that he should accompany them want to go over and see old broderson annixter objected
but presley informed him that broderson had gone to bonneville earlier in the morning
he had seen him go past in his buckboard
the three men set off phelps and annixter on horseback presley on his bicycle
when they had gone mrs derrick sought out her husband in the office of the ranch house
she was at her prettiest that morning her cheeks flushed with excitement her innocent wideopen eyes almost girlish
she had fastened her hair still moist with a black ribbon tied at the back of her head and the soft mass of light brown reached to below her waist making her look very young
what was it he was saying to you just now she exclaimed as she came through the gate in the greenpainted wire railing of the office
what was mr annixter saying
i know
he was trying to get you to join him trying to persuade you to be dishonest wasnot that it
tell me magnus wasnot that it
magnus nodded
his wife drew close to him putting a hand on his shoulder
but you wonot will you
you wonot listen to him again you wonot so much as allow even suppose you would lend yourself to bribery
oh magnus i donot know what has come over you these last few weeks
why before this you would have been insulted if any one thought you would even consider anything like dishonesty
magnus it would break my heart if you joined mr annixter and mr osterman
why you couldnot be the same man to me afterward you who have kept yourself so clean till now
and the boys what would lyman say and harran and every one who knows you and respects you if you lowered yourself to be just a political adventurer
for a moment derrick leaned his head upon his hand avoiding her gaze
at length he said drawing a deep breath am troubled annie
these are the evil days
i have much upon my mind
evil days or not she insisted promise me this one thing that you will not join mr scheme
she had taken his hand in both of hers and was looking into his face her pretty eyes full of pleading
promise me she repeated give me your word
whatever happens let me always be able to be proud of you as i always have been
give me your word
i know you never seriously thought of joining mr annixter but i am so nervous and frightened sometimes
just to relieve my mind magnus give me your word are right he answered
no i never thought seriously of it
only for a moment i was ambitious to donot know i had hoped to be oncewell that is over now
annie your husband is a disappointed man
give me your word she insisted
we can talk about other things afterward
again magnus wavered about to yield to his better instincts and to the entreaties of his wife
he began to see how perilously far he had gone in this business
he was drifting closer to it every hour
already he was entangled already his foot was caught in the mesh that was being spun
sharply he recoiled
again all his instincts of honesty revolted
no whatever happened he would preserve his integrity
his wife was right
always she had influenced his better side
at that moment repugnance of the proposed political campaign was at its pitch of intensity
he wondered how he had ever allowed himself to so much as entertain the idea of joining with the others
now he would wrench free would in a single instant of power clear himself of all compromising relations
he turned to his wife
upon his lips trembled the promise she implored
but suddenly there came to his mind the recollection of his newmade pledge to annixter
he had given his word that before arriving at a decision he would have a last interview with him
to magnus his given word was sacred
though now he wanted to he could not as yet draw back could not promise his wife that he would decide to do right
the matter must be delayed a few days longer
lamely he explained this to her
annie derrick made but little response when he had done
she kissed his forehead and went out of the room uneasy depressed her mind thronging with vague fears leaving magnus before his office desk his head in his hands thoughtful gloomy assaulted by forebodings
meanwhile annixter phelps and presley continued on their way toward bonneville
in a short time they had turned into the county road by the great wateringtank and proceeded onward in the shade of the interminable line of poplar trees the windbreak that stretched along the roadside bordering the broderson ranch
but as they drew near to saloon and grocery about half a mile outside of bonneville they recognised horse tied to the railing in front of it
annixter left the others and went in to see harran
harran he said when the two had sat down on either side of one of the small tables got to make up your mind one way or another pretty soon
what are you going to do
are you going to stand by and see the rest of the committee spending money by the bucketful in this thing and keep your hands in your pockets
if we win youll benefit just as much as the rest of us
i suppose youve got some money of your have havenot you
you are your fathers manager arenot you
disconcerted at directness harran stammered an affirmative adding hard to know just what to do a mean position for me buck
i want to help you others but i do want to play fair
i donot know how to play any other way
i should like to have a line from the governor as to how to act but theres no getting a word out of him these days
he seems to want to let me decide for myself
well look here put in annixter
suppose you keep out of the thing till its all over and then share and share alike with the committee on campaign expenses
harran fell thoughtful his hands in his pockets frowning moodily at the toe of his boot
there was a silence
then donot like to go it blind he hazarded sort of sharing the responsibility of what you do then a silent partner
and donot want to have any difficulties with the governor always got along well together
he wouldnot like it you know if i did anything like that
say exclaimed annixter abruptly if the governor says he will keep his hands off and that you can do as you please will you come in
for sake let us ranchers act together for once stand in with each other in fight
without knowing it annixter had touched the right spring donot know but what youre right harran murmured vaguely
his sense of discouragement that feeling of whatstheuse was never more oppressive
all fair means had been tried
the wheat grower was at last with his back to the wall
if he chose his own means of fighting the responsibility must rest upon his enemies not on himself the only way to accomplish anything he continued standing in with each other well go ahead and see what you can do
if the governor is willing come in for my share of the campaign fund some sense exclaimed annixter shaking him by the hand
half the fight is over already got disbrow you know and the next thing is to get hold of some of those rotten san francisco bosses
osterman will but harran interrupted him making a quick gesture with his hand tell me about it he said donot want to know what you and osterman are going to do
if i did i shouldnot come in
yet for all this before they said goodbye annixter had obtained promise that he would attend the next meeting of the committee when osterman should return from los angeles and make his report
harran went on toward los muertos
annixter mounted and rode into bonneville
bonneville was very lively at all times
it was a little city of some twenty or thirty thousand inhabitants where as yet the city hall the high school building and the opera house were objects of civic pride
it was well governed beautifully clean full of the energy and strenuous young life of a new city
an air of the briskest activity pervaded its streets and sidewalks
the business portion of the town centring about main street was always crowded
annixter arriving at the post office found himself involved in a scene of swiftly shifting sights and sounds
saddle horses farm inevitable grey with the dust of country roads buckboards with squashes and grocery packages stowed under the seat twowheeled sulkies and training carts were hitched to the gnawed railings and zincsheathed telegraph poles along the curb
here and there on the edge of the sidewalk were bicycles wedged into bicycle racks painted with cigar advertisements
upon the asphalt sidewalk itself soft and sticky with the mornings heat was a continuous movement
men with large stomachs wearing linen coats but no vests laboured ponderously up and down
girls in lawn skirts shirt waists and garden hats went to and fro invariably in couples coming in and out of the drug store the grocery store and haberdashers or lingering in front of the post office which was on a corner under the hall
young men in shirt sleeves with brown wicker cuffprotectors over their forearms and pencils behind their ears bustled in front of the grocery store anxious and preoccupied
a very old man a mexican in ragged white trousers and bare feet sat on a horseblock in front of the barber shop holding a horse by a rope around its neck
a chinaman went by teetering under the weight of his market baskets slung on a pole across his shoulders
in the neighbourhood of the hotel the yosemite house travelling salesmen drummers for jewelry firms of san francisco commercial agents insurance men welldressed metropolitan debonair stood about cracking jokes or hurried in and out of the flapping white doors of the yosemite barroom
the yosemite bus and city bus passed up the street on the way from the morning train each with its two or three passengers
a very narrow wagon belonging to the cole colemore harvester works went by loaded with long strips of iron that made a horrible din as they jarred over the unevenness of the pavement
the electric car line the citys boast did a brisk business its cars whirring from end to end of the street with a jangling of bells and a moaning plaint of gearing
on the stone bulkheads of the grass plat around the new city hall the usual loafers sat chewing tobacco swapping stories
in the park were the inevitable array of nursemaids skylarking couples and ragged little boys
a single policeman in grey coat and helmet friend and acquaintance of every man and woman in the town stood by the park entrance leaning an elbow on the fence post twirling his club
but in the centre of the best business block of the street was a threestory building of rough brown stone set off with plate glass windows and goldlettered signs
one of these latter read pacific and southwestern railroad freight and passenger office while another much smaller beneath the windows of the second story bore the inscription and land office
annixter hitched his horse to the iron post in front of this building and tramped up to the second floor letting himself into an office where a couple of clerks and bookkeepers sat at work behind a high wire screen
one of these latter recognised him and came forward
hello said annixter abruptly scowling the while
is your boss in
is ruggles in
the bookkeeper led annixter to the private office in an adjoining room ushering him through a door on the frosted glass of which was painted the name cyrus blakelee ruggles
inside a man in a frock coat shoestring necktie and stetson hat sat writing at a rollertop desk
over this desk was a vast map of the railroad holdings in the country about bonneville and guadalajara the alternate sections belonging to the corporation accurately plotted
ruggles was cordial in his welcome of annixter
he had a way of fiddling with his pencil continually while he talked scribbling vague lines and fragments of words and names on stray bits of paper and no sooner had annixter sat down than he had begun to write in fullbellied script all over his blotting pad want to see about those lands of mean of the railroads annixter commenced at once want to know when i can buy sick of fooling along like this
well mr annixter observed ruggles writing a great before the and finishing it off with a flourishing the crossed out one of the and noted the effect with a hasty lands are practically yours
you have an option on them indefinitely and as it is you donot have to pay the taxes
rot your option
i want to own them annixter declared
what have you people got to gain by putting off selling them to us
here this thing has dragged along for over eight years
when i came in on quien sabe the understanding was that the alternate to be conveyed to me within a few months
the land had not been patented to us then answered ruggles
well it has been now i guess retorted annixter sure i couldnot tell you mr annixter
annixter crossed his legs weariedly
oh whats the good of lying ruggles
you know better than to talk that way to me face flushed on the instant but he checked his answer and laughed instead
oh if you know so much about it he observed
well when are you going to sell to me only acting for the general office mr annixter returned ruggles
whenever the directors are ready to take that matter up be only too glad to put it through for you
as if you didnot know
look here youre not talking to old broderson
wake up ruggles all this talk in rag about the grading of the value of our lands this winter and an advance in the price
ruggles spread out his hands with a deprecatory gesture donot own the mercury he said
well your company does
if it does i donot know anything about it
oh rot
as if you and genslinger and behrman didnot run the whole show down here
come on lets have it ruggles
what does behrman pay genslinger for inserting that threeinch ad of the and in his paper
ten thousand a year hey
oh why not a hundred thousand and be done with it returned the other willing to take it as a joke
instead of replying annixter drew his checkbook from his inside pocket
let me take that fountain pen of yours he said
holding the book on his knee he wrote out a check tore it carefully from the stub and laid it on the desk in front of ruggles this asked ruggles payment for the sections of railroad land included in my ranch based on a valuation of two dollars and a half per acre
you can have the balance in sixtyday notes
ruggles shook his head drawing hastily back from the check as though it carried contamination canot touch it he declared no authority to sell to you yet donot understand you people exclaimed annixter offered to buy of you the same way four years ago and you sang the same song
why it isnot business
you lose the interest on your money
seven per cent of that capital for four can figure it out big money
well then i donot see why youre so keen on parting with it
you can get seven per cent the same as us want to own my own land returned annixter want to feel that every lump of dirt inside my fence is my personal property
why the very house i live in ranch on railroad ground
but youve an option tell you i donot want your cursed option
i want ownership and its the same with magnus derrick and old broderson and osterman and all the ranchers of the county
we want to own our land want to feel we can do as we blame please with it
suppose i should want to sell quien sabe
i canot sell it as a whole till bought of you
i canot give anybody a clear title
the land has doubled in value ten times over again since i came in on it and improved it worth easily twenty an acre now
but i canot take advantage of that rise in value so long as you wonot sell so long as i donot own it blocking me
but according to you the railroad canot take advantage of the rise in any case
according to you you can sell for twenty dollars but we can only get two and a half
who made it worth twenty cried annixter improved it up to that figure
genslinger seems to have that idea in his nut too
do you people think you can hold that land untaxed for speculative purposes until it goes up to thirty dollars and then sell out to some one it over our heads
you and genslinger werenot in office when those contracts were drawn
you ask your boss you ask behrman he knows
the general office is pledged to sell to us in preference to any one else for two and a half
well observed ruggles decidedly tapping the end of his pencil on his desk and leaning forward to emphasise his words not selling said and signed mr annixter
why not
come spit it out the bunco game this time
because were not ready your check
you wonot take it
no make it a cash payment money whole of to cyrus blakelee ruggles for the and no
third and last time
no
oh go to the devil donot like your tone mr annixter returned ruggles flushing angrily donot give a curse whether you like it or not retorted annixter rising and thrusting the check into his pocket but never you mind mr ruggles you and behrman and genslinger and shelgrim and the whole gang of thieves of wake this state of california up some of these days by going just one little bit too far and therell be an election of railroad commissioners of by and for the people thatll get a twist of you my buncosteering and your backers and cappers and swindlers and thimbleriggers and smash you lock stock and barrel my tip to you and be damned to you mr cyrus blackleg ruggles
annixter stormed out of the room slamming the door behind him and ruggles trembling with anger turned to his desk and to the blotting pad written all over with the words a and over and over again with great swelling curves and flourishes but as annixter passed into the outside office on the other side of the wire partition he noted the figure of a man at the counter in conversation with one of the clerks
there was something familiar to eye about the mans heavy built frame his great shoulders and massive back and as he spoke to the clerk in a tremendous rumbling voice annixter promptly recognised dyke
there was a meeting
annixter liked dyke as did every one else in and about bonneville
he paused now to shake hands with the discharged engineer and to ask about his little daughter sidney to whom he knew dyke was devotedly attached
smartest little tad in tulare county asserted dyke getting prettier every day mr annixter a little tad that was just born to be a lady
can recite the whole of snow bound without ever stopping
you donot believe that maybe hey
well its true be just old enough to enter the seminary up at marysville next winter and if my hop business pays two per cent on the investment theres where shes going to go it coming on inquired annixter
the hop ranch
prime about got the land in shape and engaged a foreman who knows all about hops been in luck
everybody will go into the business next year when they see hops go to a dollar and theyll overstock the market and bust the price
but going to get the cream of it now
i say two per cent
why lord love you it will pay a good deal more than that got to cost more than i figured to start the thing so perhaps i may have to borrow somewheres but then on such a sure game as i do want to make something out of that little tad of mine
through here inquired annixter making ready to move off
in just a minute answered dyke
wait for me and walk down the street with you
annixter grumbled that he was in a hurry but waited nevertheless while dyke again approached the clerk shall want some empty cars of you people this fall he explained a hopraiser now and i just want to make sure what your rates on hops are been told but i want to make sure
savvy
there was a long delay while the clerk consulted the tariff schedules and annixter fretted impatiently
dyke growing uneasy leaned heavily on his elbows watching the clerk anxiously
if the tariff was exorbitant he saw his plans brought to naught his money jeopardised the little tad sidney deprived of her education
he began to blame himself that he had not long before determined definitely what the railroad would charge for moving his hops
he told himself he was not much of a business man that he managed carelessly
two cents suddenly announced the clerk with a certain surly indifference
two cents a pound
yes two cents a in carload lots of course
i wonot give you that rate on smaller consignments
yes carload lots of course two cents
well all right
he turned away with a great sigh of relief
he sure did have me scared for a minute he said to annixter as the two went down to the street fiddling and fussing so long
two cents is all right though
seems fair to me
that fiddling of his was all put on
i know em these railroad heelers
he knew i was a discharged employee first off and he played the game just to make me seem small because i had to ask favours of him
i donot suppose the general office tips its slavees off to act like swine but theres the feeling through the whole herd of them
ye got to come to us
we let ye live only so long as we choose and what are ye going to do about it
if ye donot like it git out annixter and the engineer descended to the street and had a drink at the yosemite bar and annixter went into the general store while dyke bought a little pair of red slippers for sidney
before the salesman had wrapped them up dyke slipped a dime into the toe of each with a wink at annixter
let the little tad find em there he said behind his hand in a hoarse whisper be one on sid
where to now demanded annixter as they regained the street going down to the post office and then pull out for the ranch
going my way
dyke hesitated in some confusion tugging at the ends of his fine blonde beard
no no
i guess leave you here other things to do up the street
so long
the two separated and annixter hurried through the crowd to the post office but the mail that had come in on that mornings train was unusually heavy
it was nearly half an hour before it was distributed
naturally enough annixter placed all the blame of the delay upon the railroad and delivered himself of some pointed remarks in the midst of the waiting crowd
he was irritated to the last degree when he finally emerged upon the sidewalk again cramming his mail into his pockets
one cause of his bad temper was the fact that in the bundle of quien sabe letters was one to hilma tree in a mans handwriting
huh
annixter had growled to himself that pip delaney
seems now that to act as gobetween for em
well maybe that feemale girl gets this letter and then again maybe she donot
but suddenly his attention was diverted
directly opposite the post office upon the corner of the street stood quite the best business building of which bonneville could boast
it was built of colusa granite very solid ornate imposing
upon the heavy plate of the window of its main floor in gold and red letters one read the words loan and savings bank of tulare county
it was of this bank that behrman was president
at the street entrance of the building was a curved sign of polished brass fixed upon the angle of the masonry this sign bore the name behrman and under it in smaller letters were the words real estate mortgages
as glance fell upon this building he was surprised to see dyke standing upon the curb in front of it apparently reading from a newspaper that he held in his hand
but annixter promptly discovered that he was not reading at all
from time to time the former engineer shot a swift glance out of the corner of his eye up and down the street
annixter jumped at a conclusion
an idea suddenly occurred to him
dyke was watching to see if he was waiting an opportunity when no one who knew him should be in sight
annixter stepped back a little getting a telegraph pole somewhat between him and the other
very interested he watched what was going on
pretty soon dyke thrust the paper into his pocket and sauntered slowly to the windows of a stationery store next the street entrance of offices
for a few seconds he stood there his back turned seemingly absorbed in the display but eyeing the street narrowly nevertheless then he turned around gave a last look about and stepped swiftly into the doorway by the great brass sign
he disappeared
annixter came from behind the telegraph pole with a flush of actual shame upon his face
there had been something so slinking so mean in the movements and manner of this great burly honest fellow of an engineer that he could not help but feel ashamed for him
circumstances were such that a simple business transaction was to dyke almost culpable a degradation a thing to be concealed
borrowing money of behrman commented annixter mortgaging your little homestead to the railroad putting your neck in the halter
poor fool
the pity of it
good lord your hops must pay you big now old man
annixter lunched at the yosemite hotel and then later on toward the middle of the afternoon rode out of the town at a canter by the way of the upper road that paralleled the railroad tracks and that ran diametrically straight between bonneville and guadalajara
about halfway between the two places he overtook father sarria trudging back to san juan his long cassock powdered with dust
he had a wicker crate in one hand and in the other in a small square valise the materials for the holy sacrament
since early morning the priest had covered nearly fifteen miles on foot in order to administer extreme unction to a moribund goodfornothing a greaser half indian half portuguese who lived in a remote corner of stock range at the head of a canon there
but he had returned by way of bonneville to get a crate that had come for him from san diego
he had been notified of its arrival the day before
annixter pulled up and passed the time of day with the priest donot often get up your way he said slowing down his horse to accommodate deliberate plodding
sarria wiped the perspiration from his smooth shiny face
you
well with you it is different he answered
but there are a great many catholics in the on your ranch
and so few come to the mission
at high mass on sundays there are a and spaniards from guadalajara mostly but weekdays for matins vespers and the like i often say the offices to an empty voice of one crying in the wilderness
you americans are not good churchmen
sundays you read the newspapers
well theres vanamee observed annixter suppose hes there early and late
sarria made a sharp movement of interest
ah strange lad a wonderful character for all that
if there were only more like him
i am troubled about him
you know i am a very owl at night
i come and go about the mission at all hours
within the week three times i have seen vanamee in the little garden by the mission and at the dead of night
he had come without asking for me
he did not see me
it was strange
once when i had got up at dawn to ring for early matins i saw him stealing away out of the garden
he must have been there all the night
he is acting queerly
he is pale his cheeks are more sunken than ever
there is something wrong with him
i canot make it out
it is a mystery
suppose you ask him
not enough to bother myself about
vanamee is crazy in the head
some morning he will turn up missing again and drop out of sight for another three years
best let him alone sarria a crank
how is that greaser of yours up on stock range
ah the poor poor fellow returned the other the tears coming to his eyes
he died this you might say in my arms painfully but in the faith in the faith
a good fellow lazy cattlestealing dago
you misjudge him
a really good fellow on better acquaintance
annixter grunted scornfully kindness and goodwill toward the most outrageous reprobates of the ranches was proverbial
he practically supported some halfdozen families that lived in forgotten cabins lost and all but inaccessible in the far corners of stock range and canyon
this particular greaser was the laziest the dirtiest the most worthless of the lot
but in mind the lout was an object of affection sincere unquestioning
thrice a week the priest with a basket of ham a bottle of wine olives loaves of bread even a chicken or over the interminable stretch of country between the mission and his cabin
of late during the rascals sickness these visits had been almost daily
hardly once did the priest leave the bedside that he did not slip a halfdollar into the palm of his wife or oldest daughter
and this was but one case out of many
his kindliness toward animals was the same
a horde of mangecorroded curs lived off his bounty wolfish ungrateful often marking him with their teeth yet never knowing the meaning of a harsh word
a burro overfed lazy incorrigible browsed on the hill back of the mission obstinately refusing to be harnessed to little cart squealing and biting whenever the attempt was made and the priest suffered him submitting to his humour inventing excuses for him alleging that the burro was foundered or was in need of shoes or was feeble from extreme age
the two peacocks magnificent proud coldhearted resenting all familiarity he served with the timorous apologetic affection of a queens ladyinwaiting resigned to their disdain happy if only they condescended to enjoy the grain he spread for them
at the long trestle annixter and the priest left the road and took the trail that crossed broderson creek by the clumps of greygreen willows and led across quien sabe to the ranch house and to the mission farther on
they were obliged to proceed in single file here and annixter who had allowed the priest to go in front promptly took notice of the wicker basket he carried
upon his inquiry sarria became confused
it was a basket that he had had sent down to him from the city
well i whats in it sureah chicken or two
fancy breed
yes yes thats it a fancy breed
at the ranch house where they arrived toward five oclock annixter insisted that the priest should stop long enough for a glass of sherry
sarria left the basket and his small black valise at the foot of the porch steps and sat down in a rocker on the porch itself fanning himself with his broadbrimmed hat and shaking the dust from his cassock
annixter brought out the decanter of sherry and glasses and the two drank to each others health
but as the priest set down his glass wiping his lips with a murmur of satisfaction the decrepit irish setter that had attached himself to house came out from underneath the porch and nosed vigorously about the wicker basket
he upset it
the little peg holding down the cover slipped the basket fell sideways opening as it fell and a cock his head enclosed in a little chamois bag such as are used for gold watches struggled blindly out into the open air
a second similarly hooded followed
the pair stupefied in their headgear stood rigid and bewildered in their tracks clucking uneasily
their tails were closely sheared
their legs thickly muscled and extraordinarily long were furnished with enormous cruellooking spurs
the breed was unmistakable
annixter looked once at the pair then shouted with laughter chicken or breedho yes i should think so
game cocks
fighting cocks
oh you old rat be a dry nurse to a burro and keep a hospital for infirm puppies but you will fight game cocks
oh lord
why sarria this is as good a grind as i ever heard the spanish cropping out after all
speechless with chagrin the priest bundled the cocks into the basket and catching up the valise took himself abruptly away almost running till he had put himself out of hearing of raillery
and even ten minutes later when annixter still chuckling stood upon the porch steps he saw the priest far in the distance climbing the slope of the high ground in the direction of the mission still hurrying on at a great pace his cassock flapping behind him his head bent to notion the very picture of discomfiture and confusion
as annixter turned about to reenter the house he found himself almost face to face with hilma tree
she was just going in at the doorway and a great flame of the sunset shooting in under the eaves of the porch enveloped her from her head with its thick moist hair that hung low over her neck to her slim feet setting a golden flash in the little steel buckles of her low shoes
she had come to set the table for supper
taken all aback by the suddenness of the encounter annixter ejaculated an abrupt and senseless excuse me
but hilma without raising her eyes passed on unmoved into the diningroom leaving annixter trying to find his breath and fumbling with the brim of his hat that he was surprised to find he had taken from his head
resolutely and taking a quick advantage of his opportunity he followed her into the diningroom see that dog has turned up he announced with brisk cheerfulness
that irish setter i was asking about
hilma a swift pink flush deepening the delicate rose of her cheeks did not reply except by nodding her head
she flung the tablecloth out from under her arms across the table spreading it smooth with quick little caresses of her hands
there was a moments silence
then annixter said a letter for you
he laid it down on the table near her and hilma picked it up
and see here miss hilma annixter continued about suppose you think i am a firstclass mucker
if it will do any good to apologise why i will
i want to be friends with you
i made a bad mistake and started in the wrong way
i donot know much about women people
i want you to forget about morning and not think i am a galoot and a mucker
will you do it
will you be friends with me
hilma set the plate and coffee cup by place before answering and annixter repeated his question
then she drew a deep quick breath the flush in her cheeks returning think it was so wrong of you she murmured
oh you donot know how it hurt me
i criedoh for an hour
well thats just it returned annixter vaguely moving his head uneasily didnot know what kind of a girl you mean i made a mistake
i thought it didnot make much difference
i thought all feemales were about alike hope you know now murmured hilma ruefully paid enough to have you find out
i donot know
why it hurt me worse than anything i can remember
i hope you know now
well i do know now he exclaimed
it wasnot so much that you tried to you did answered hilma the single deep swell from her waist to her throat rising and falling in her emotion
it was that you thought that you anybody could that wanted i held myself so cheap
oh she cried with a sudden sobbing catch in her throat never can forget it and you donot know what it means to a girl
well thats just what i do want he repeated want you to forget it and have us be good friends
in his embarrassment annixter could think of no other words
he kept reiterating again and again during the pauses of the conversation want you to forget it
will you
will you forget morning and have us be good friends
he could see that her trouble was keen
he was astonished that the matter should be so grave in her estimation
after all what was it that a girl should be kissed
but he wanted to regain his lost ground
will you forget it miss hilma
i want you to like me
she took a clean napkin from the sideboard drawer and laid it down by the plate do want you to like me persisted annixter want you to forget all about this business and like me
hilma was silent
annixter saw the tears in her eyes
how about that
will you forget it
will you me
she shook her head
no she said
no what
you wonot like me
is that it
hilma blinking at the napkin through her tears nodded to say yes that was it
annixter hesitated a moment frowning harassed and perplexed
you donot like me at all hey
at length hilma found her speech
in her low voice lower and more velvety than ever she said donot like you at all
then as the tears suddenly overpowered her she dashed a hand across her eyes and ran from the room and out of doors
annixter stood for a moment thoughtful his protruding lower lip thrust out his hands in his pocket suppose shell quit now he muttered
suppose shell leave the she hates me like that
well she can can go
fool feemale girl he muttered between his teeth petticoat mess
he was about to sit down to his supper when his eye fell upon the irish setter on his haunches in the doorway
there was an expectant ingratiating look on the dogs face
no doubt he suspected it was time for eating
get roared annixter in a tempest of wrath
the dog slunk back his tail shut down close his ears drooping but instead of running away he lay down and rolled supinely upon his back the very image of submission tame abject disgusting
it was the one thing to drive annixter to a fury
he kicked the dog off the porch in a rolling explosion of oaths and flung himself down to his seat before the table fuming and panting
damn the dog and the girl and the whole rotten now he exclaimed as a sudden fancied qualm arose in his stomach now its all made me sick
might have known it
oh it only lacked that to wind up the whole day
let her go i donot care and the sooner the better
he countermanded the supper and went to bed before it was dark lighting his lamp on the chair near the head of the bed and opening his copperfield at the place marked by the strip of paper torn from the bag of prunes
for upward of an hour he read the novel methodically swallowing one prune every time he reached the bottom of a page
about nine oclock he blew out the lamp and punching up his pillow settled himself for the night
then as his mind relaxed in that strange hypnotic condition that comes just before sleep a series of pictures of the days doings passed before his imagination like the roll of a kinetoscope
first it was hilma tree as he had seen her in the dairyhousecharming delicious radiant of youth her thick white neck with its pale amber shadows under the chin her wide open eyes rimmed with fine black lashes the deep swell of her breast and hips the delicate lustrous floss on her cheek impalpable as the pollen of a flower
he saw her standing there in the scintillating light of the morning her smooth arms wet with milk redolent and fragrant of milk her whole desirable figure moving in the golden glory of the sun steeped in a lambent flame saturated with it glowing with it joyous as the dawn itself
then it was los muertos and hooven the sordid little dutchman grimed with the soil he worked in yet vividly remembering a period of military glory exciting himself with recollections of gravelotte and the kaiser but contented now in the country of his adoption defining the fatherland as the place where wife and children lived
then came the ranch house of los muertos under the grove of cypress and eucalyptus with its smooth gravelled driveway and wellgroomed lawns mrs derrick with her wideopened eyes that so easily took on a look of uneasiness of innocence of anxious inquiry her face still pretty her brown hair that still retained so much of its brightness spread over her chair back drying in the sun magnus erect as an officer of cavalry smoothshaven grey thinlipped imposing with his hawklike nose and forwardcurling grey hair presley with his dark face delicate mouth and sensitive loose lips in corduroys and laced boots smoking interesting figure suggestive of a mixed origin morbid excitable melancholy brooding upon things that had no names
then it was bonneville with the gayety and confusion of main street the whirring electric cars the zincsheathed telegraph poles the buckboards with squashes stowed under the seats ruggles in frock coat stetson hat and shoestring necktie writing abstractedly upon his blotting pad dyke the engineer bigboned
powerful deepvoiced goodnatured with his fine blonde beard and massive arms rehearsing the praises of his little daughter sidney guided only by the one ambition that she should be educated at a seminary slipping a dime into the toe of her diminutive slipper then later overwhelmed with shame slinking into office to mortgage his homestead to the heeler of the corporation that had discharged him
by suggestion annixter saw behrman too fat with a vast stomach the check and neck meeting to form a great tremulous jowl the roll of fat over his collar sprinkled with sparse stiff hairs saw his brown roundtopped hat of varnished straw the linen vest stamped with innumerable interlocked horseshoes the heavy watch chain clinking against the pearl vest buttons invariably placid unruffled never losing his temper serene unassailable enthroned
then at the end of all it was the ranch again seen in a last brief glance before he had gone to bed the fecundated earth calm at last nursing the emplanted germ of life ruddy with the sunset the horizons purple the small clamour of the day lapsing into quiet the great still twilight building itself domelike toward the zenith
the barn fowls were roosting in the trees near the stable the horses crunching their fodder in the stalls the days work ceasing by slow degrees and the priest the spanish churchman father sarria relic of a departed regime kindly benign believing in all goodness a lover of his fellows and of dumb animals yet for all that hurrying away in confusion and discomfiture carrying in one hand the vessels of the holy communion and in the other a basket of game cocks
it was high noon and the rays of the sun that hung poised directly overhead in an intolerable white glory fell straight as plummets upon the roofs and streets of guadalajara
the adobe walls and sparse brick sidewalks of the drowsing town radiated the heat in an oily quivering shimmer
the leaves of the eucalyptus trees around the plaza drooped motionless limp and relaxed under the scorching searching blaze
the shadows of these trees had shrunk to their smallest circumference contracting close about the trunks
the shade had dwindled to the breadth of a mere line
the sun was everywhere
the heat exhaling from brick and plaster and metal met the heat that steadily descended blanketwise and smothering from the pale scorched sky
only the lived in chinks of the crumbling adobe and in interstices of the without motionless as if stuffed their eyes closed to mere slits basking stupefied with heat
at long intervals the prolonged drone of an insect developed out of the silence vibrated a moment in a soothing somnolent long note then trailed slowly into the quiet again
somewhere in the interior of one of the dobe houses a guitar snored and hummed sleepily
on the roof of the hotel a group of pigeons cooed incessantly with subdued liquid murmurs very plaintive a cat perfectly white with a pink nose and thin pink lips dozed complacently on a fence rail full in the sun
in a corner of the plaza three hens wallowed in the baking hot dust their wings fluttering clucking comfortably
and this was all
a sunday repose prevailed the whole moribund town peaceful profound
a certain pleasing numbness a sense of grateful enervation exhaled from the scorching plaster
there was no movement no sound of human business
the faint hum of the insect the intermittent murmur of the guitar the mellow complainings of the pigeons the prolonged purr of the white cat the contented clucking of the these noises mingled together to form a faint drowsy bourdon prolonged stupefying suggestive of an infinite quiet of a calm complacent life centuries old lapsing gradually to its end under the gorgeous loneliness of a cloudless pale blue sky and the steady fire of an interminable sun
in spanishmexican restaurant vanamee and presley sat opposite each other at one of the tables near the door a bottle of white wine tortillas and an earthen pot of frijoles between them
they were the sole occupants of the place
it was the day that annixter had chosen for his barndance and in consequence quien sabe was in fete and work suspended
presley and vanamee had arranged to spend the day in each others company lunching at and taking a long tramp in the afternoon
for the moment they sat back in their chairs their meal all but finished
solotari brought black coffee and a small carafe of mescal and retiring to a corner of the room went to sleep
all through the meal presley had been wondering over a certain change he observed in his friend
he looked at him again lean spare face was of an olive pallor
his long black hair such as one sees in the saints and evangelists of the artists hung over his ears
presley again remarked his pointed beard black and fine growing from the hollow cheeks
he looked at his face a face like that of a young seer like a halfinspired shepherd of the hebraic legends a dweller in the wilderness gifted with strange powers
he was dressed as when presley had first met him herding his sheep in brown canvas overalls thrust into top boots grey flannel shirt open at the throat showing the breast ruddy with tan the waist encircled with a cartridge belt empty of cartridges
but now as presley took more careful note of him he was surprised to observe a certain new look in deepset eyes
he remembered now that all through the morning vanamee had been singularly reserved
he was continually drifting into reveries abstracted distrait
indubitably something of moment had happened
at length vanamee spoke
leaning back in his chair his thumbs in his belt his bearded chin upon his breast his voice was the even monotone of one speaking in his sleep
he told presley in a few words what had happened during the first night he had spent in the garden of the old mission of the answer halffancied halfreal that had come to him
to no other person but you would i speak of this he said but you i think will be sympathetic at least and i feel the need of unburdening myself of it to some one
at first i would not trust my own senses
i was sure i had deceived myself but on a second night it happened again
then i was no not afraid but disturbedoh shaken to my very hearts core
i resolved to go no further in the matter never again to put it to test
for a long time i stayed away from the mission occupying myself with my work keeping it out of my mind
but the temptation was too strong
one night i found myself there again under the black shadow of the pear trees calling for angele summoning her from out the dark from out the night
this time the answer was prompt unmistakable
i cannot explain to you what it was nor how it came to me for there was no sound
i saw absolutely nothing but the empty night
there was no moon
but somewhere off there over the little valley far off the darkness was troubled that that went out upon my from the mission garden out over the valley calling for her searching for her found i donot know what but found a resting companion
three times since then i have gone to the mission garden at night
last night was the third time
he paused his eyes shining with excitement
presley leaned forward toward him motionless with intense absorption last night he prompted
vanamee stirred in his seat his glance fell he drummed an instant upon the table
last night he answered there was a change
the answer was he drew a deep breathnearer
you are sure
the other smiled with absolute certainty
it was not that i found the answer sooner easier
i could not be mistaken
no that which has troubled the darkness that which has entered into the empty coming nearer to nearer actually nearer
his voice sank again
his face like the face of younger prophets the seers took on a halfinspired expression
he looked vaguely before him with unseeing eyes
suppose he murmured suppose i stand there under the pear trees at night and call her again and again and each time the answer comes nearer and nearer and i wait until at last one night the supreme night of all sheshe suddenly the tension broke
with a sharp cry and a violent uncertain gesture of the hand vanamee came to himself
oh he exclaimed what is it
do i dare
what does it mean
there are times when it appals me and there are times when it thrills me with a sweetness and a happiness that i have not known since she died
the vagueness of it
how can i explain it to you this that happens when i call to her across the faint faroff unseen tremble in the darkness that intangible scarcely perceptible stir
something neither heard nor seen appealing to a sixth sense only
listen it is something like this on quien sabe all last week we have been seeding the earth
the grain is there now under the earth buried in the dark in the black stillness under the clods
can you imagine the very first little quiver of life that the grain of wheat must feel after it is sown when it answers to the call of the sun down there in the dark of the earth blind deaf the very first stir from the inert long long before any physical change has before the microscope could discover the slightest the shell first tightens with the first faint premonition of life
well it is something as illusive as that
he paused again dreaming lost in a reverie then just above a whisper murmured which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and she angele died
you could not have been mistaken said presley
you were sure that there was something
imagination can do so much and the influence of the surroundings was strong
how impossible it would be that anything happen
and you say you heard nothing saw nothing believe answered vanamee in a sixth sense or rather a whole system of other unnamed senses beyond the reach of our understanding
people who live much alone and close to nature experience the sensation of it
perhaps it is something fundamental that we share with plants and animals
the same thing that sends the birds south long before the first colds the same thing that makes the grain of wheat struggle up to meet the sun
and this sense never deceives
you may see wrong hear wrong but once touch this sixth sense and it acts with absolute fidelity you are certain
no i hear nothing in the mission garden
i see nothing nothing touches me but i am for all that
presley hesitated for a moment then he asked shall you go back to the garden again
make the test again donot know
strange enough commented presley wondering
vanamee sank back in his chair his eyes growing vacant again strange enough he murmured
there was a long silence
neither spoke nor moved
there in that moribund ancient town wrapped in its siesta flagellated with heat deserted ignored baking in a noonday silence these two strange men the one a poet by nature the other by training both out of tune with their world dreamers introspective morbid lost and unfamiliar at that time searching for a sign groping and baffled amidst the perplexing obscurity of the delusion sat over empty wine glasses silent with the pervading silence that surrounded them hearing only the cooing of doves and the drone of bees the quiet so profound that at length they could plainly distinguish at intervals the puffing and coughing of a locomotive switching cars in the station yard of bonneville
it was no doubt this jarring sound that at length roused presley from his lethargy
the two friends rose solotari very sleepily came forward they paid for the luncheon and stepping out into the heat and glare of the streets of the town passed on through it and took the road that led northward across a corner of hop fields
they were bound for the hills in the northeastern corner of quien sabe
it was the same walk which presley had taken on the previous occasion when he had first met vanamee herding the sheep
this encompassing detour around the whole countryside was a favorite pastime of his and he was anxious that vanamee should share his pleasure in it
but soon after leaving guadalajara they found themselves upon the land that dyke had bought and upon which he was to raise his famous crop of hops house was close at hand a very pleasant little cottage painted white with green blinds and deep porches while near it and yet in process of construction were two great storehouses and a drying and curing house where the hops were to be stored and treated
all about were evidences that the former engineer had already been hard at work
the ground had been put in readiness to receive the crop and a bewildering innumerable multitude of poles connected with a maze of wire and twine had been set out
farther on at a turn of the road they came upon dyke himself driving a farm wagon loaded with more poles
he was in his shirt sleeves his massive hairy arms bare to the elbow glistening with sweat red with heat
in his belllike rumbling voice he was calling to his foreman and a boy at work in stringing the poles together
at sight of presley and vanamee he hailed them jovially addressing them as boys and insisting that they should get into the wagon with him and drive to the house for a glass of beer
his mother had only the day before returned from marysville where she had been looking up a seminary for the little tad
she would be delighted to see the two boys besides vanamee must see how the little tad had grown since he last set eyes on her wouldnot know her for the same little girl and the beer had been on ice since morning
presley and vanamee could not well refuse
they climbed into the wagon and jolted over the uneven ground through the bare forest of hoppoles to the house
inside they found mrs dyke an old lady with a very gentle face who wore a cap and a very oldfashioned gown with hoop skirts dusting the whatnot in a corner of the parlor
the two men were presented and the beer was had from off the ice
mother said dyke as he wiped the froth from his great blond beard sid anywheres about
i want mr vanamee to see how she has grown
smartest little tad in tulare county boys
can recite the whole of snow bound end to end without skipping or looking at the book
maybe you donot believe that
mother ainot i skipping a line hey
mrs dyke nodded to say that it was so but explained that sidney was in guadalajara
in putting on her new slippers for the first time the morning before she had found a dime in the toe of one of them and had had the whole house by the ears ever since till she could spend it
was it for licorice to make her licorice water inquired dyke gravely
yes said mrs dyke made her tell me what she was going to get before she went and it was licorice
dyke though his mother protested that he was foolish and that presley and vanamee had no great interest in young ones insisted upon showing the visitors copybooks
they were monuments of laborious elaborate neatness the trite moralities and readymade aphorisms of the philanthropists and publicists repeated from page to page with wearying insistence too am an american citizen
as the twig is bent the tree is inclined truth crushed to earth will rise again as for me give me liberty or give me death and last of all a strange intrusion amongst the mild wellworn phrases two legends
my control of public franchises and the and is an enemy of the state see commented presley you mean the little tad to understand the situation early told him he was foolish to give that to sid to copy said mrs dyke with indulgent remonstrance
what can she understand of public franchises
never mind observed dyke remember it when she grows up and when the seminary people have rubbed her up a bit and then shell begin to ask questions and understand
and donot you make any mistake mother he went on about the little tad not knowing who her dads enemies are
what do you think boys
listen here
precious little ever told her of the railroad or how i was turned off but the other day i was working down by the fence next the railroad tracks and sid was there brought her doll rags down and she was playing house behind a pile of hop poles
well along comes a through train from missouri points and a string of empties from new when it had passed what do you suppose the tad did didnot know i was watching her
she goes to the fence and spits a little spit after the caboose and puts out her little head and if youll believe me at the train and mother says she does that same every time she sees a train go by and never crosses the tracks that she donot spit her little spit on em
what do you of but i correct her every time protested mrs dyke seriously
where she picked up the trick of hissing i donot know
no its not funny
it seems dreadful to see a little girl whos as sweet and gentle as can be in every other way so venomous
she says the other little girls at school and the boys too are all the same way
oh dear she sighed why will the general office be so unkind and unjust
why i couldnot be happy with all the money in the world if i thought that even one little child hated me so that it would spit and hiss at me
and its not one child its all of them so sidney says and think of all the grown people who hate the road women and men the whole county the whole state thousands and thousands of people the managers and the directors of the road ever think of that they ever think of all the hate that surrounds them everywhere everywhere and the good people that just grit their teeth when the name of the road is mentioned
why do they want to make the people hate them
no she murmured the tears starting to her eyes no i tell you mr presley the men who own the railroad are wicked badhearted men who donot care how much the poor people suffer so long as the road makes its eighteen million a year
they donot care whether the people hate them or love them just so long as they are afraid of them not right and god will punish them sooner or later
a little after this the two young men took themselves away dyke obligingly carrying them in the wagon as far as the gate that opened into the quien sabe ranch
on the way presley referred to what mrs dyke had said and led dyke himself to speak of the and well dyke said like this mr presley personally havenot got the right to kick
with you wheatgrowing people i guess its different but hops you see donot count for much in the state such a little business that the road donot want to bother themselves to tax it the wheat growers that the road cinches
the rates on hops got to admit that i was in to bonneville a while ago to find out two cents a pound and lord love you thats reasonable enough to suit any man
no he concluded on the way to make money now
the road sacking me as they did was maybe a good thing for me after all
it came just at the right time
i had a bit of money put by and here was the chance to go into hops with the certainty that hops would quadruple and quintuple in price inside the year
no it was my chance and though they didnot mean it by a long chalk the railroad people did me a good turn when they gave me my the tadll enter the seminary next fall
about a quarter of an hour after they had said goodbye to the onetime engineer presley and vanamee tramping briskly along the road that led northward through quien sabe arrived at ranch house
at once they were aware of a vast and unwonted bustle that revolved about the place
they stopped a few moments looking on amused and interested in what was going forward
the colossal barn was finished
its freshly whitewashed sides glared intolerably in the sun but its interior was as yet innocent of paint and through the yawning vent of the sliding doors came a delicious odour of new fresh wood and shavings
a crowd of farm swarming all about it
some were balanced on the topmost rounds of ladders hanging festoons of japanese lanterns from tree to tree and all across the front of the barn itself
mrs tree her daughter hilma and another woman were inside the barn cutting into long strips bolt after bolt of red white and blue cambric and directing how these strips should be draped from the ceiling and on the walls everywhere resounded the tapping of tack hammers
a farm wagon drove up loaded to overflowing with evergreens and with great bundles of palm leaves and these were immediately seized upon and affixed as supplementary decorations to the tricoloured cambric upon the inside walls of the barn
two of the larger evergreen trees were placed on either side the barn door and their tops bent over to form an arch
in the middle of this arch it was proposed to hang a mammoth pasteboard escutcheon with gold letters spelling the word piles of chairs rented from hall in bonneville heaped themselves in an apparently hopeless entanglement on the ground while at the far extremity of the barn a couple of carpenters clattered about the impromptu staging which was to accommodate the band
there was a strenuous gayety in the air everybody was in the best of spirits
notes of laughter continually interrupted the conversation on every hand
at every moment a group of men involved themselves in uproarious horseplay
they passed oblique jokes behind their hands to each veiled doublemeanings meant for the bellowed with laughter thereat stamping on the ground
the relations between the sexes grew more intimate the women and girls pushing the young fellows away from their sides with vigorous thrusts of their elbows
it was passed from group to group that adela vacca a division superintendents wife had lost her garter the daughter of the foreman of the home ranch was kissed behind the door of the dairyhouse
annixter in execrable temper appeared from time to time hatless his stiff yellow hair in wild disorder
he hurried between the barn and the ranch house carrying now a wickered demijohn now a case of wine now a basket of lemons and pineapples
besides general supervision he had elected to assume the responsibility of composing the stiff by jingo a punch that would raise you right out of your boots a regular hairlifter
the harness room of the barn he had set apart for himself and intimates
he had brought a long table down from the house and upon it had set out boxes of cigars bottles of whiskey and of beer and the great china bowls for the punch
it would be no fault of his he declared if half the number of his men friends were not uproarious before they left
his barn dance would be the talk of all tulare county for years to come
for this one day he had resolved to put all thoughts of business out of his head
for the matter of that things were going well enough
osterman was back from los angeles with a favourable report as to his affair with disbrow and darrell
there had been another meeting of the committee
harran derrick had attended
though he had taken no part in the discussion annixter was satisfied
the governor had consented to allow harran to come in if he so desired and harran had pledged himself to share onesixth of the campaign expenses providing these did not exceed a certain figure
as annixter came to the door of the barn to shout abuse at the distraught chinese cook who was cutting up lemons in the kitchen he caught sight of presley and vanamee and hailed them
hello pres he called
come over here and see how she looks he indicated the barn with a movement of his head
well were getting ready for you tonight he went on as the two friends came up
but how we are going to get straightened out by eight oclock i donot know
would you believe that pip caraher is short of this last minute and i told him want three cases of em as much as a month ago and here just when i want a good lively saddle horse to get around on somebody hikes the buckskin out the corral her by jingo have the law on that thief if it breaks a sixtydollar saddle n headstall gone with her and only about half the number of jap lanterns that i ordered have shown up and not candles enough for those enough to make a dog sick nothing done that you donot do yourself unless you stand over these loafers with a club sick of the whole lost my hat wish to god never dreamed of givin this rotten fool dance
clutter the whole place up with a lot of feemales
i sure did lose my presence of mind when i got idea
then ignoring the fact that it was he himself who had called the young men to him he added well this is my busy day
sorry i canot stop and talk to you longer
he shouted a last imprecation at the chinaman and turned back into the barn
presley and vanamee went on but annixter as he crossed the floor of the barn all but collided with hilma tree who came out from one of the stalls a box of candles in her arms
gasping out an apology annixter reentered the harness room closing the door behind him and forgetting all the responsibility of the moment lit a cigar and sat down in one of the hired chairs his hands in his pockets his feet on the table frowning thoughtfully through the blue smoke
annixter was at last driven to confess to himself that he could not get the thought of hilma tree out of his mind
finally she had got a hold on him
the thing that of all others he most dreaded had happened
a feemale girl had got a hold on him and now there was no longer for him any such thing as peace of mind
the idea of the young woman was with him continually
he went to bed with it he got up with it
at every moment of the day he was pestered with it
it interfered with his work got mixed up in his business
what a miserable confession for a man to make a fine way to waste his time
was it possible that only the other day he had stood in front of the music store in bonneville and seriously considered making hilma a present of a musicbox
even now the very thought of it made him flush with shame and this after she had told him plainly that she did not like him
he was running after herhe annixter
he ripped out a furious oath striking the table with his boot heel
again and again he had resolved to put the whole affair from out his mind
once he had been able to do so but of late it was becoming harder and harder with every successive day
he had only to close his eyes to see her as plain as if she stood before him he saw her in a glory of sunlight that set a fine tinted lustre of pale carnation and gold on the silken sheen of her white skin her hair sparkled with it her thick strong neck sloping to her shoulders with beautiful full curves seemed to radiate the light her eyes brown wide innocent in expression disclosing the full disc of the pupil upon the slightest provocation flashed in this sunlight like diamonds
annixter was all bewildered
with the exception of the timid little creature in the glovecleaning establishment in sacramento he had had no acquaintance with any woman
his world was harsh crude a world of men who were to be combatted hand was against nearly every one of them
women he distrusted with the instinctive distrust of the overgrown schoolboy
now at length a young woman had come into his life
promptly he was struck with discomfiture annoyed almost beyond endurance harassed bedevilled excited made angry and exasperated
he was suspicious of the woman yet desired her totally ignorant of how to approach her hating the sex yet drawn to the individual confusing the two emotions sometimes even hating hilma as a result of this confusion but at all times disturbed vexed irritated beyond power of expression
at length annixter cast his cigar from him and plunged again into the work of the day
the afternoon wore to evening to the accompaniment of wearying and clamorous endeavour
in some unexplained fashion the labour of putting the great barn in readiness for the dance was accomplished the last bolt of cambric was hung in place from the rafters
the last evergreen tree was nailed to the joists of the walls the last lantern hung the last nail driven into the musicians platform
the sun set there was a great scurry to have supper and dress
annixter last of all the other workers left the barn in the dusk of twilight
he was alone he had a saw under one arm a bag of tools was in his hand
he was in his shirt sleeves and carried his coat over his shoulder a hammer was thrust into one of his hip pockets
he was in execrable temper
the days work had fagged him out
he had not been able to find his hat
and the buckskin with sixty dollars worth of saddle gone too he groaned
oh ainot it sweet
at his house mrs tree had set out a cold supper for him the inevitable dish of prunes serving as dessert
after supper annixter bathed and dressed
he decided at the last moment to wear his usual towngoing suit a sack suit of black made by a bonneville tailor
but his hat was gone
there were other hats he might have worn but because this particular one was lost he fretted about it all through his dressing and then decided to have one more look around the barn for it
for over a quarter of an hour he pottered about the barn going from stall to stall rummaging the harness room and feed room all to no purpose
at last he came out again upon the main floor definitely giving up the search looking about him to see if everything was in order
the festoons of japanese lanterns in and around the barn were not yet lighted but some halfdozen lamps with great tin reflectors that hung against the walls were burning low
a dull half light pervaded the vast interior hollow echoing leaving the corners and roof thick with impenetrable black shadows
the barn faced the west and through the open sliding doors was streaming a single bright bar from the afterglow incongruous and out of all harmony with the dull flare of the kerosene lamps
as annixter glanced about him he saw a figure step briskly out of the shadows of one corner of the building pause for the fraction of one instant in the bar of light then at sight of him dart back again
there was a sound of hurried footsteps
annixter with recollections of the stolen buckskin in his mind cried out sharply there
there was no answer
in a second his pistol was in his hand there
quick speak up or shoot
no no no donot shoot cried an answering voice
oh be careful
tree
annixter slid the pistol into his pocket with a great qualm of apprehension
he came forward and met hilma in the doorway
good lord he murmured that sure did give me a start
if i shot hilma stood abashed and confused before him
she was dressed in a white organdie frock of the most rigorous simplicity and wore neither flower nor ornament
the severity of her dress made her look even larger than usual and even as it was her eyes were on a level with there was a certain fascination in the contradiction of stature and character of great girl halfchild as yet but tall as a man for all that
there was a moments awkward silence then hilma explained came back to look for my hat
i thought i left it here this afternoon
and i was looking for my hat cried annixter
funny enough hey
they laughed at this as heartily as children might have done
the constraint of the situation was a little relaxed and annixter with sudden directness glanced sharply at the young woman and demanded well miss hilma hate me as much as ever
oh no sir she answered never said i hated you me then i know you said that disliked what you to do
it made me angry and it hurt me
i shouldnot have said what i did that time but it was your fault
you mean you shouldnot have said you didnot like me asked annixter
why
well donot anybody admitted hilma
then i can take it that you donot dislike is that it donot dislike anybody persisted hilma
well i asked you more than that didnot queried annixter uneasily asked you to like me remember the other day asking you that again now
i want you to like me
hilma lifted her eyes inquiringly to his
in her words was an unmistakable ring of absolute sincerity
innocently she inquired why
annixter was struck speechless
in the face of such candour such perfect ingenuousness he was at a loss for any words he stammered donot know he suddenly burst out
that is he went on groping for his wits canot quite say why
the idea of a colossal lie occurred to him a thing actually royal like to have the people who are around me like me he declared like to be popular understand
yes thats it he continued more reassured donot like the idea of any one disliking me the way i am my nature
oh then returned hilma you neednot bother
no i donot dislike you
well thats good declared annixter judicially good
but hold on he interrupted forgetting not enough to not dislike me
i want you to like me
how about hilma paused for a moment glancing vaguely out of the doorway toward the lighted window of the dairyhouse her head tilted donot know that i ever thought about that she said
well think about it now insisted annixter
but i never thought about liking anybody particularly she observed because i like everybody donot you see
well youve got to like some people more than other people hazarded annixter and i want to be one of those some people savvy
good lord i donot know how to say these fool things
i talk like a galoot when i get talking to feemale girls and i canot lay my tongue to anything that sounds right
it isnot my nature
and look here i lied when i said i liked to have people like be popular
rot
i donot care a curse about peoples opinions of me
but theres a few people that are more to me than most chap presley for those people i want to have like me
what they think counts
pshaw
i know got enemies piles of them
i could name you half a dozen men right now that are naturally itching to take a shot at me
how about this ranch
i know canot i hear the men growling oaths under their breath after gone by
and in business ways too he went on speaking half to himself in bonneville and all over the county theres not a man of them wouldnot howl for joy if they got a chance to down buck annixter
think i care
why i it
i run my ranch to suit myself and i play my game my own way a driver i know it and a bully too
oh i know what they call brute beast with a twist in my temper that would rile up a newborn lamb and crusty and pigheaded and obstinate
they say all that but theyve got to say too that cleverer than any manjack in the running nobody can get ahead of me
his eyes snapped
let em grind their teeth
they canot down me
when i shut my fist theres not one of them can open it
no not with a he turned to hilma again
well when a mans hated as much as that it stands to reason donot it miss hilma that the few friends he has got he wants to keep not such an entire swine to the people that know me jackass presley for instance put my hand in the fire to do him a real service
sometimes i get kind of lonesome wonder if you would understand my fault but theres not a horse about the place that donot lay his ears back when i get on him theres not a dog donot put his tail between his legs as soon as i come near him
the cayuse isnot foaled yet here on quien sabe that can throw me nor the dog whelped that would dare show his teeth at me
i kick that irish setter every time i see wonder what do though if he didnot slink so much if he wagged his tail and was glad to see me
so it all comes to this like to have youwell sort of feel that i was a good friend of yours and like me because of it
the flame in the lamp on the wall in front of hilma stretched upward tall and thin and began to smoke
she went over to where the lamp hung and standing on tiptoe lowered the wick
as she reached her hand up annixter noted how the sombre lurid red of the lamp made a warm reflection on her smooth round arm
do you understand he queried
yes why yes she answered turning around very good of you to want to be a friend of mine
i didnot think so though when you tried to kiss me
but maybe its all right since youve explained things
you see different from you
i like everybody to like me and i like to like everybody
it makes one so much happier
you wouldnot believe it but you ought to try it sir just to see so good to be good to people and to have people good to you
and everybody has always been so good to me
mamma and papa of course and billy the stableman and montalegre the portugee foreman and the chinese cook even and mr he went mrs vacca and her little delaney hey demanded annixter abruptly
you and he were pretty good friends were you
oh yes she answered
he was just as to me
every day in the summer time he used to ride over to the seed ranch back of the mission and bring me a great armful of flowers the prettiest things and i used to pretend to pay him for them with dollars made of cheese that i cut out of the cheese with a biscuit cutter
it was such fun
we were the best of friends another lamp smoking growled annixter
turn it down will see that somebody sweeps this floor here all littered up with pine needles got a lot to do sir
annixter returned to the ranch house his teeth clenched enraged his face flushed
ah he muttered delaney hey
throwing it up to me that i fired him
his teeth gripped together more fiercely than ever
the best of friends hey
by god have that girl yet show that cowpuncher
i her employer her boss show delaney too
it would be easy then delaney can have he wants me
an evil light flashing from under his scowl spread over his face
the male instincts of possession unreasoned treacherous oblique came twisting to the surface
all the lower nature of the man ignorant of women racked at one and the same time with enmity and desire roused itself like a hideous and abominable beast
and at the same moment hilma returned to her house humming to herself as she walked her white dress glowing with a shimmer of faint saffron light in the last ray of the afterglow
a little after halfpast seven the first carryall bearing the druggist of bonneville and his womenfolk arrived in front of the new barn
immediately afterward an express wagon loaded down with a swarming family of spanishmexicans gorgeous in red and yellow colours followed
billy the stableman and his assistant took charge of the teams unchecking the horses and hitching them to a fence back of the barn
then caraher the saloonkeeper in derby hat prince albert coat pointed yellow shoes and inevitable red necktie drove into the yard on his buckboard the delayed box of lemons under the seat
it looked as if the whole array of invited guests was to arrive in one unbroken procession but for a long halfhour nobody else appeared
annixter and caraher withdrew to the harness room and promptly involved themselves in a wrangle as to the makeup of the famous punch
from time to time their voices could be heard uplifted in clamorous argument
two quarts and a half and a cupful of chartreuse
rot rot i know better
champagne straight and a dash of brandy
the druggists wife and sister retired to the feed room where a bureau with a swinging mirror had been placed for the convenience of the women
the druggist stood awkwardly outside the door of the feed room his coat collar turned up against the draughts that drifted through the barn his face troubled debating anxiously as to the propriety of putting on his gloves
the spanishmexican family a father mother and five children and sisterinlaw sat rigid on the edges of the hired chairs silent constrained their eyes lowered their elbows in at their sides glancing furtively from under their eyebrows at the decorations or watching with intense absorption young vacca son of one of the division superintendents who wore a checked coat and white thread gloves and who paced up and down the length of the barn frowning very important whittling a wax candle over the floor to make it slippery for dancing
the musicians arrived the city band of having managed to offend the leader of the dirigo club orchestra at the very last moment to such a point that he had refused his services
these members of the city band repaired at once to their platform in the corner
at every instant they laughed uproariously among themselves joshing one of their number a frenchman whom they called skeezicks
their hilarity reverberated in a hollow metallic roll among the rafters overhead
the druggist observed to young vacca as he passed by that he thought them pretty fresh just the same busy very busy returned the young man continuing on his way still frowning and paring the stump of candle
two quarts n a half
two quarts n a half
ah yes in a way thats so and then again in a way it i know better
all along one side of the barn were a row of stalls fourteen of them clean as yet redolent of new cut wood the sawdust still in the cracks of the flooring
deliberately the druggist went from one to the other pausing contemplatively before each
he returned down the line and again took up his position by the door of the feed room nodding his head judicially as if satisfied
he decided to put on his gloves
by now it was quite dark
outside between the barn and the ranch houses one could see a group of men on stepladders lighting the festoons of japanese lanterns
in the darkness only their faces appeared here and there high above the ground seen in a haze of red strange grotesque
gradually as the multitude of lanterns were lit the light spread
the grass underfoot looked like green excelsior
another group of men invaded the barn itself lighting the lamps and lanterns there
soon the whole place was gleaming with points of light
young vacca who had disappeared returned with his pockets full of wax candles
he resumed his whittling refusing to answer any questions vociferating that he was busy
outside there was a sound of hoofs and voices
more guests had arrived
the druggist seized with confusion terrified lest he had put on his gloves too soon thrust his hands into his pockets
it was cutter magnus division superintendent who came bringing his wife and her two girl cousins
they had come fifteen miles by the trail from the far distant division house on four of los muertos and had ridden on horseback instead of driving
mrs cutter could be heard declaring that she was nearly dead and felt more like going to bed than dancing
the two girl cousins in dresses of dotted swiss over blue sateen were doing their utmost to pacify her
she could be heard protesting from moment to moment
one distinguished the phrases straight to my bed back nearly broken in two never wanted to come in the first place
the druggist observing cutter take a pair of gloves from mrs reticule drew his hands from his pockets
but abruptly there was an interruption
in the musicians corner a scuffle broke out
a chair was overturned
there was a noise of imprecations mingled with shouts of derision
skeezicks the frenchman had turned upon the joshers
ah no he was heard to exclaim at the end of the end it is too much
kind of a bad will go to see about that
aha let him close up his face before i demolish it with a good stroke of the fist
the men who were lighting the lanterns were obliged to intervene before he could be placated
hooven and his wife and daughters arrived
minna was carrying little hilda already asleep in her arms
minna looked very pretty striking even with her black hair pale face very red lips and greenishblue eyes
she was dressed in what had been mrs wedding gown a cheap affair of satin
mrs hooven had pendent earrings of imitation jet in her ears
hooven was wearing an old frock coat of magnus the sleeves too long the shoulders absurdly too wide
he and cutter at once entered into an excited conversation as to the ownership of a certain steer
why the brand ach gott der brendt hooven clasped his head ach der brendt dot maks me laugh some laughs
i see der boole mit der bleck star bei der vorehead in der middle oaf
any someones you esk tell you dot is mein boole
you esk any someones
der brendt
to hell mit der brendt
you aindt got some memorie aboudt does ting i guess nodt
please step aside gentlemen said young vacca who was still making the rounds of the floor
hooven whirled about
eh
what den he exclaimed still excited willing to be angry at any one for the moment
doand you push soh you
i tink berhapz you doand dose barn hey busy very busy
the young man pushed by with grave preoccupation
two quarts n a half
two quarts n a half know better all rot
but the barn was filling up rapidly
at every moment there was a rattle of a newly arrived vehicle from outside
guest after guest appeared in the doorway singly or in couples or in families or in garrulous parties of five and six
now it was phelps and his mother from los muertos now a foreman from with his family now a gayly apparelled clerk from a bonneville store solitary and bewildered looking for a place to put his hat now a couple of spanishmexican girls from guadalajara with coquettish effects of black and yellow about their dress now a group of tenants portuguese swarthy with plastered hair and curled mustaches redolent of cheap perfumes
sarria arrived his smooth shiny face glistening with perspiration
he wore a new cassock and carried his broadbrimmed hat under his arm
his appearance made quite a stir
he passed from group to group urbane affable shaking hands right and left he assumed a set smile of amiability which never left his face the whole evening
but abruptly there was a veritable sensation
from out the little crowd that persistently huddled about the doorway came osterman
he wore a dresssuit with a white waistcoat and patent leather a wonder
a little qualm of excitement spread around the barn
one exchanged nudges of the elbow with ones neighbour whispering earnestly behind the hand
what astonishing clothes
catch on to the coattails
it was a masquerade costume maybe that goat osterman was such a josher one never could tell what he would do next
the musicians began to tune up
from their corner came a medley of mellow sounds the subdued chirps of the violins the dull bourdon of the bass viol the liquid gurgling of the flageolet and the deeptoned snarl of the big horn with now and then a rasping stridulating of the snare drum
a sense of gayety began to spread throughout the assembly
at every moment the crowd increased
the aroma of newsawn timber and sawdust began to be mingled with the feminine odour of sachet and flowers
there was a babel of talk in the baritone and soprano by an occasional note of laughter and the swish of stiffly starched petticoats
on the row of chairs that went around three sides of the wall groups began to settle themselves
for a long time the guests huddled close to the doorway the lower end of the floor was crowded the upper end deserted but by degrees the lines of white muslin and pink and blue sateen extended dotted with the darker figures of men in black suits
the conversation grew louder as the timidity of the early moments wore off
groups at a distance called back and forth conversations were carried on at top voice
once even a whole party hurried across the floor from one side of the barn to the other
annixter emerged from the harness room his face red with wrangling
he took a position to the right of the door shaking hands with newcomers inviting them over and over again to cut loose and whoop it along
into the ears of his more intimate male acquaintances he dropped a word as to punch and cigars in the harness room later on winking with vast intelligence
ranchers from remoter parts of the country appeared garnett from the ruby rancho keast from the ranch of the same name gethings of the san pablo chattern of the bonanza and others and still others a score of men for the most part bearded slow of speech deliberate dressed in broadcloth
old broderson who entered with his wife on his arm fell in with this type and with them came a certain dabney of whom nothing but his name was known a silent old man who made no friends whom nobody knew or spoke to who was seen only upon such occasions as this coming from no one knew where going no one cared to inquire whither
between eight and halfpast magnus derrick and his family were seen entry caused no little impression
some said the governor and called their companions attention to the thin erect figure commanding imposing dominating all in his immediate neighbourhood
harran came with him wearing a cutaway suit of black
he was undeniably handsome young and fresh looking his cheeks highly coloured quite the finest looking of all the younger men blond strong with that certain courtliness of manner that had always made him liked
he took his mother upon his arm and conducted her to a seat by the side of mrs broderson
annie derrick was very pretty that evening
she was dressed in a grey silk gown with a collar of pink velvet
her light brown hair that yet retained so much of its brightness was transfixed by a high shell comb very spanish
but the look of uneasiness in her large eyes of a young deepening every day
the expression of innocence and inquiry which they so easily assumed was disturbed by a faint suggestion of aversion almost of terror
she settled herself in her place in the corner of the hall in the rear rank of chairs a little frightened by the glare of lights the hum of talk and the shifting crowd glad to be out of the way to attract no attention willing to obliterate herself
all at once annixter who had just shaken hands with dyke his mother and the little tad moved abruptly in his place drawing in his breath sharply
the crowd around the great wideopen main door of the barn had somewhat thinned out and in the few groups that still remained there he had suddenly recognised mr and mrs tree and hilma making their way towards some empty seats near the entrance of the feed room
in the dusky light of the barn earlier in the evening annixter had not been able to see hilma plainly
now however as she passed before his eyes in the glittering radiance of the lamps and lanterns he caught his breath in astonishment
never had she appeared more beautiful in his eyes
it did not seem possible that this was the same girl whom he saw every day in and around the ranch house and dairy the girl of simple calico frocks and plain shirt waists who brought him his dinner who made up his bed
now he could not take his eyes from her
hilma for the first time was wearing her hair done high upon her head
the thick sweetsmelling masses bitumen brown in the shadows corruscated like golden filaments in the light
her organdie frock was long longer than any she had yet worn
it left a little of her neck and breast bare and all of her arm
annixter muttered an exclamation
such arms
how did she manage to keep them hid on ordinary occasions
big at the shoulder tapering with delicious modulations to the elbow and wrist overlaid with a delicate gleaming lustre
as often as she turned her head the movement sent a slow undulation over her neck and shoulders the pale ambertinted shadows under her chin coming and going over the creamy whiteness of the skin like the changing moire of silk
the pretty rose colour of her cheek had deepened to a pale carnation
annixter his hands clasped behind him stood watching
in a few moments hilma was surrounded by a group of young men clamouring for dances
they came from all corners of the barn leaving the other girls precipitately almost rudely
there could be little doubt as to who was to be the belle of the occasion little triumph was immediate complete
annixter could hear her voice from time to time its usual velvety huskiness vibrating to a note of exuberant gayety
all at once the orchestra swung off into a grand march
there was a great rush to secure partners
young vacca still going the rounds was pushed to one side
the gayly apparelled clerk from the bonneville store lost his head in the confusion
he could not find his partner
he roamed wildly about the barn bewildered his eyes rolling
he resolved to prepare an elaborate programme card on the back of an old envelope
rapidly the line was formed hilma and harran derrick in the lead annixter having obstinately refused to engage in either march set or dance the whole evening
soon the confused shuffling of feet settled to a measured cadence the orchestra blared and wailed the snare drum rolling at exact intervals the cornet marking the time
it was halfpast eight oclock
annixter drew a long breath good he muttered the thing is under way at last
singularly enough osterman also refused to dance
the week before he had returned from los angeles bursting with the importance of his mission
he had been successful
he had disbrow in his pocket
he was impatient to pose before the others of the committee as a skilful political agent a manipulator
he forgot his attitude of the early part of the evening when he had drawn attention to himself with his wonderful clothes
now his comic actors face with its brownishred cheeks protuberant ears and horizontal slit of a mouth was overcast with gravity
his bald forehead was seamed with the wrinkles of responsibility
he drew annixter into one of the empty stalls and began an elaborate explanation glib voluble interminable going over again in detail what he had reported to the committee in outline kept lay low but annixter refused to listen
oh rot your schemes a punch in the harness room that will make the hair grow on the top of your head in the place where the hair ought to grow
come on well round up some of the boys and walk into it
they edged their way around the hall outside the grand march toward the harness room picking up on their way caraher dyke hooven and old broderson
once in the harness room annixter shot the bolt
that affair outside he observed will take care of itself but heres a little orphan child that gets lonesome without company
annixter began ladling the punch filling the glasses
osterman proposed a toast to quien sabe and the biggest barn
their elbows crooked in silence
old broderson set down his glass wiping his long beard and remarking certainly is agreeable
i remember a punch i drank on christmas day in or no it was 84anyhow that was in he wandered on aimlessly unable to stop his flow of speech losing himself in details involving his talk in a hopeless maze of trivialities to which nobody paid any attention donot drink myself observed dyke but just a taste of that with a lot of water wouldnot be bad for the little tad think it was lemonade
he was about to mix a glass for sidney but thought better of it at the last moment the chartreuse thats lacking commented caraher lowering at annixter
the other flared up on the instant
rot rot
i know better
in some punches it goes and then again in others it donot
but it was left to hooven to launch the successful phrase gesundheit he exclaimed holding out his second glass
after drinking he replaced it on the table with a long breath
ach gott he cried dat poonsch say i tink dot poonsch mek some demn goot vertilizer hey
fertiliser
the others roared with laughter
good eye bismarck commented annixter
the name had a great success
thereafter throughout the evening the punch was invariably spoken of as the fertiliser
osterman having spilt the bottom of a glassful on the floor pretended that he saw shoots of grain coming up on the spot
suddenly he turned upon old broderson bald ainot want to know how i lost my hair
promise you wonot ask a single other question and tell you
promise your word of honour
eh donot understand
your hair
yes promise
how did you lose it
it was bit off
the other gazed at him stupefied his jaw dropped
the company shouted and old broderson believing he had somehow accomplished a witticism chuckled in his beard wagging his head
but suddenly he fell grave struck with an idea
he demanded what bit it off
ah vociferated osterman what you promised not to ask
the company doubled up with hilarity
caraher leaned against the door holding his sides but hooven all abroad unable to follow gazed from face to face with a vacant grin thinking it was still a question of his famous phrase
vertilizer hey
dots some fine joke hey
you bedt
what with the noise of their talk and laughter it was some time before dyke first of all heard a persistent knocking on the bolted door
he called attention to the sound
cursing the intruder annixter unbolted and opened the door
but at once his manner changed
hello
presley
come in come in pres
there was a shout of welcome from the others
a spirit of effusive cordiality had begun to dominate the gathering
annixter caught sight of vanamee back of presley and waiving for the moment the distinction of employer and employee insisted that both the friends should come in
any friend of pres is my friend he declared
but when the two had entered and had exchanged greetings presley drew annixter aside
vanamee and i have just come from bonneville he explained
we saw delaney there got the buckskin and hes full of bad whiskey and dagored
you should see him hes wearing all his cowpunching outfit hair trousers sombrero spurs and all the rest of it and he has strapped himself to a big revolver
he says he wasnot invited to your barn dance but that hes coming over to shoot up the place
he says you promised to show him off quien sabe at the toe of your boot and that hes going to give you the chance tonight
ah commented annixter nodding his head he is is he
presley was disappointed
knowing irascibility he had expected to produce a more dramatic effect
he began to explain the danger of the business
delaney had once knifed a greaser in the panamint country
he was known as a bad man
but annixter refused to be drawn
all right he said all right tell anybody else
you might scare the girls off
get in and drink
outside the dancing was by this time in full swing
the orchestra was playing a polka
young vacca now at his fiftieth wax candle had brought the floor to the slippery surface of glass
the druggist was dancing with one of the spanishmexican girls with the solemnity of an automaton turning about and about always in the same direction his eyes glassy his teeth set hilma tree was dancing for the second time with harran derrick
she danced with infinite grace
her cheeks were bright red her eyes halfclosed and through her parted lips she drew from time to time a long tremulous breath of pure delight
the music the weaving colours the heat of the air by now a little oppressive the monotony of repeated sensation even the pain of physical fatigue had exalted all her senses
she was in a dreamy lethargy of happiness
it was her first ball
she could have danced without stopping until morning
minna hooven and cutter were promenading
mrs hooven with little hilda already asleep on her knees never took her eyes from her daughters gown
as often as minna passed near her she vented an energetic pst pst
the metal tip of a white draw string was showing from underneath the waist of dress
mrs hooven was on the point of tears
the solitary gayly apparelled clerk from bonneville was in a fever of agitation
he had lost his elaborate programme card
bewildered beside himself with trepidation he hurried about the room jostled by the dancing couples tripping over the feet of those who were seated he peered distressfully under the chairs and about the floor asking anxious questions
magnus derrick the centre of a listening circle of from the ruby rancho keast from the ranch of the same name gethings and chattern of the san pablo and near the great open doorway of the barn discussing the possibility of a shortage in the worlds wheat crop for the next year
abruptly the orchestra ceased playing with a roll of the snare drum a flourish of the cornet and a prolonged growl of the bass viol
the dance broke up the couples hurrying to their seats leaving the gayly apparelled clerk suddenly isolated in the middle of the floor rolling his eyes
the druggist released the spanishmexican girl with mechanical precision out amidst the crowd of dancers
he bowed dropping his chin upon his cravat throughout the dance neither had hazarded a word
the girl found her way alone to a chair but the druggist sick from continually revolving in the same direction walked unsteadily toward the wall
all at once the barn reeled around him he fell down
there was a great laugh but he scrambled to his feet and disappeared abruptly out into the night through the doorway of the barn deathly pale his hand upon his stomach
dabney the old man whom nobody knew approached the group of ranchers around magnus derrick and stood a little removed listening gravely to what the governor was saying his chin sunk in his collar silent offering no opinions
but the leader of the orchestra with a great gesture of his violin bow cried out all take partners for the lancers and promenade around the hall
however there was a delay
a little crowd formed around the musicians platform voices were raised there was a commotion
skeezicks who played the big horn accused the cornet and the snaredrum of stealing his cold lunch
at intervals he could be heard expostulating ah no at the end of the end
render me the sausages you or less i break your throat
aha
i know you
you are going to play me there a bad farce
my sausages and the pork sandwich else i go away from this place
he made an exaggerated show of replacing his big horn in its case but the bystanders raised a great protest
the sandwiches and one sausage were produced the other had disappeared
in the end skeezichs allowed himself to be appeased
the dance was resumed
half an hour later the gathering in the harness room was considerably reinforced
it was the corner of the barn toward which the male guests naturally gravitated
harran derrick who only cared to dance with hilma tree was admitted
garnett from the ruby rancho and gethings from the san pablo came in a little afterwards
a fourth bowl of punch was mixed annixter and caraher clamouring into each others face as to its ingredients
cigars were lighted
soon the air of the room became blue with an acrid haze of smoke
it was very warm
ranged in their chairs around the side of the room the guests emptied glass after glass
vanamee alone refused to drink
he sat a little to one side disassociating himself from what was going forward watching the others calmly a little contemptuously a cigarette in his fingers
hooven after drinking his third glass however was afflicted with a great sadness his breast heaved with immense sighs
he asserted that he was obbressed cutter had taken his steer
he retired to a corner and seated himself in a heap on his chair his heels on the rungs wiping the tears from his eyes refusing to be comforted
old broderson startled annixter who sat next to him out of all measure by suddenly winking at him with infinite craftiness
when i was a lad in ukiah he whispered hoarsely was a devil of a fellow with the girls but lordy he nudged him slyly wouldnot have it known
of those who were drinking annixter alone retained all his wits
though keeping pace with the others glass for glass the punch left him solid upon his feet clearheaded
the tough crossgrained fibre of him seemed proof against alcohol
never in his life had he been drunk
he prided himself upon his power of resistance
it was his nature
say exclaimed old broderson gravely addressing the company pulling at his beard uneasilysay a devil of a fellow with the girls
he wagged his head doggedly shutting his eyes in a knowing fashion
yes sir i am
there was a young lady in was when i was a lad of seventeen
we used to meet in the cemetery in the afternoons
i was to go away to school at sacramento and the afternoon i left we met in the cemetery and we stayed so long i almost missed the train
her name was celestine
there was a pause
the others waited for the rest of the story
and afterwards prompted annixter
afterwards
nothing afterwards
i never saw her again
her name was celestine
the company raised a chorus of derision and osterman cried ironically say a pretty good one
tell us another
the old man laughed with the rest believing he had made another hit
he called osterman to him whispering in his ear sh
look here
some night you and i will go up to san go skylarking be gay
oh rare old i am
i ainot too old see
annixter gave over the making of the fifth bowl of punch to osterman who affirmed that he had a recipe for a fertiliser from solotari that would take the plating off the ladle
he left him wrangling with caraher who still persisted in adding chartreuse and stepped out into the dance to see how things were getting on
it was the interval between two dances
in and around a stall at the farther end of the floor where lemonade was being served was a great throng of young men
others hurried across the floor singly or by twos and threes gingerly carrying overflowing glasses to their partners sitting in long rows of white and blue and pink against the opposite wall their mothers and older sisters in a second darkclothed rank behind them
a babel of talk was in the air mingled with gusts of laughter
everybody seemed having a good time
in the increasing heat the decorations of evergreen trees and festoons threw off a pungent aroma that suggested a christmas festival
in the other stalls lower down the barn the young men had brought chairs and in these deep recesses the most desperate lovemaking was in progress the young man his hair neatly parted leaning with great solicitation over the girl his partner for the moment fanning her conscientiously his arm carefully laid along the back of her chair
by the doorway annixter met sarria who had stepped out to smoke a fat black cigar
the set smile of amiability was still fixed on the priests smooth shiny face the cigar ashes had left grey streaks on the front of his cassock
he avoided annixter fearing no doubt an allusion to his game cocks and took up his position back of the second rank of chairs by the musicians stand beaming encouragingly upon every one who caught his eye
annixter was saluted right and left as he slowly went the round of the floor
at every moment he had to pause to shake hands and to listen to congratulations upon the size of his barn and the success of his dance
but he was distrait his thoughts elsewhere he did not attempt to hide his impatience when some of the young men tried to engage him in conversation asking him to be introduced to their sisters or their friends sisters
he sent them about their business harshly abominably rude leaving a wake of angry disturbance behind him sowing the seeds of future quarrels and renewed unpopularity
he was looking for hilma tree
when at last he came unexpectedly upon her standing near where mrs tree was seated some halfdozen young men hovering uneasily in her neighbourhood all his audacity was suddenly stricken from him his gruffness his overbearing insolence vanished with an abruptness that left him cold
his oldtime confusion and embarrassment returned to him
instead of speaking to her as he intended he affected not to see her but passed by his head in the air pretending a sudden interest in a japanese lantern that was about to catch fire
but he had had a single distinct glimpse of her definite precise and this glimpse was enough
hilma had changed
the change was subtle evanescent hard to define but not the less unmistakable
the excitement the enchanting delight the delicious disturbance of the first ball had produced its result
perhaps there had only been this lacking
it was hard to say but for that brief instant of time annixter was looking at hilma the woman
she was no longer the young girl upon whom he might look down to whom he might condescend whose little infantile graces were to be considered with amused toleration
when annixter returned to the harness room he let himself into a clamour of masculine hilarity
osterman had indeed made a marvellous fertiliser whiskey for the most part diluted with champagne and lemon juice
the first round of this drink had been welcomed with a salvo of cheers
hooven recovering his spirits under its violent stimulation spoke of heving ut oudt mit cudder bei gott while osterman standing on a chair at the end of the room shouted for a few moments quiet gentlemen so that he might tell a certain story he knew
but abruptly annixter discovered that the champagne whiskey brandy and the running low
this would never do
he felt that he would stand disgraced if it could be said afterward that he had not provided sufficient drink at his entertainment
he slipped out unobserved and finding two of his ranch hands near the doorway sent them down to the ranch house to bring up all the cases of stuff they found there
however when this matter had been attended to annixter did not immediately return to the harness room
on the floor of the barn a square dance was under way the leader of the city band calling the figures
young vacca indefatigably continued the rounds of the barn paring candle after candle possessed with this single idea of duty pushing the dancers out of his way refusing to admit that the floor was yet sufficiently slippery
the druggist had returned indoors and leaned dejected and melancholy against the wall near the doorway unable to dance his evenings enjoyment spoiled
the gayly apparelled clerk from bonneville had just involved himself in a deplorable incident
in a search for his handkerchief which he had lost while trying to find his programme card he had inadvertently wandered into the feed room set apart as the ladies dressing room at the moment when mrs hooven having removed the waist of dress was relacing her corsets
there was a tremendous scene
the clerk was ejected forcibly mrs hooven filling all the neighbourhood with shrill expostulation
a young man partner who stood near the feed room door waiting for her to come out had invited the clerk with elaborate sarcasm to step outside for a moment and the clerk breathless stupefied hustled from hand to hand remained petrified with staring eyes turning about and about looking wildly from face to face speechless witless wondering what had happened
but the square dance was over
the city band was just beginning to play a waltz
annixter assuring himself that everything was going all right was picking his way across the floor when he came upon hilma tree quite alone and looking anxiously among the crowd of dancers
having a good time miss hilma he demanded pausing for a moment
oh am she exclaimed
the best i donot know what has become of my partner
see left all only time this whole evening she added proudly
have you seen partner sir
i forget his name
i only met him this evening and met many i canot begin to remember half of them
he was a young man from clerk i think because i remember seeing him in a store there and he wore the prettiest clothes guess he got lost in the shuffle observed annixter
suddenly an idea occurred to him
he took his resolution in both hands
he clenched his teeth
say look here miss hilma the matter with you and i stealing this one for ourselves
i donot mean to dance
i donot propose to make a jumpingjack of myself for some galoot to give me the laugh but well walk around
will you
what do you say
hilma consented not so sorry i missed my dance with clerk she said guiltily suppose thats very bad of me isnot it
annixter fulminated a vigorous protest so warm murmured hilma fanning herself with her handkerchief and oh a good time as i have had
i was so afraid that i would be a wallflower and sit up by mamma and papa the whole evening and as it is i have had every single dance and even some dances i had to split she breathed glancing lovingly around the barn noting again the festoons of tricoloured cambric the japanese lanterns flaring lamps and decorations of evergreen ohh its all so lovely just like a fairy story and to think that it canot last but for one little evening and that tomorrow morning one must wake up to the everyday things again
well observed annixter doggedly unwilling that she should forget whom she ought to thank did my best and my best is as good as another mans i guess
hilma overwhelmed him with a burst of gratitude which he gruffly pretended to deprecate
oh that was all right
it hadnot cost him much
he liked to see people having a good time himself and the crowd did seem to be enjoying themselves
what did think
did things look lively enough
and how about she enjoying it
stupidly annixter drove the question home again at his wits end as to how to make conversation
hilma protested volubly she would never forget this night adding dance
oh you donot know how i love it
i didnot know myself
i could dance all night and never stop once
annixter was smitten with uneasiness
no doubt this promenading was not at all to her taste
wondering what kind of a spectacle he was about to make of himself he exclaimed want to dance now
oh yes she returned
they paused in their walk and hilma facing him gave herself into his arms
annixter shut his teeth the perspiration starting from his forehead
for five years he had abandoned dancing
never in his best days had it been one of his accomplishments
they hesitated a moment waiting to catch the time from the musicians
another couple bore down upon them at precisely the wrong moment jostling them out of step
annixter swore under his breath
his arm still about the young woman he pulled her over to one corner
now he muttered try again
a second time listening to the onetwothree cadence of the musicians they endeavoured to get under way
annixter waited the fraction of a second too long and stepped on foot
on the third attempt having worked out of the corner a pair of dancers bumped into them once more and as they were recovering themselves another couple caromed violently against annixter so that he all but lost his footing
he was in a rage
hilma very embarrassed was trying not to laugh and thus they found themselves out in the middle of the floor continually jostled from their position holding clumsily to each other stammering excuses into one anothers faces when delaney arrived
he came with the suddenness of an explosion
there was a commotion by the doorway a rolling burst of oaths a furious stamping of hoofs a wild scramble of the dancers to either side of the room and there he was
he had ridden the buckskin at a gallop straight through the doorway and out into the middle of the floor of the barn
once well inside delaney hauled up on the cruel spadebit at the same time driving home the spurs and the buckskin without halting in her gait rose into the air upon her hind feet and coming down again with a thunder of iron hoofs upon the hollow floor lashed out with both heels simultaneously her back arched her head between her knees
it was the running buck and had not delaney been the hardest buster in the county would have flung him headlong like a sack of sand
but he eased off the bit gripping the mares flanks with his knees and the buckskin having long since known her master came to hand quivering the bloody spume dripping from the bit upon the slippery floor
delaney had arrayed himself with painful elaboration determined to look the part bent upon creating the impression resolved that his appearance at least should justify his reputation of being bad
nothing was the campaign hat with upturned brim nor the dotted blue handkerchief knotted behind the neck nor the heavy gauntlets stitched with red above bearskin chaparejos the hair trousers of the mountain cowboy the pistol holster low on the thigh
but for the moment this holster was empty and in his right hand the hammer at full cock the chamber loaded the puncher flourished his teaser an army the lamplight dully reflected in the dark blue steel
in a second of time the dance was a bedlam
the musicians stopped with a discord and the middle of the crowded floor bared itself instantly
it was like sand blown from off a rock the throng of guests carried by an impulse that was not to be resisted bore back against the sides of the barn overturning chairs tripping upon each other falling down scrambling to their feet again stepping over one another getting behind each other diving under chairs flattening themselves against the wild clamouring pellmell blind deaf panicstricken a confused tangle of waving arms torn muslin crushed flowers pale faces tangled legs that swept in all directions back from the centre of the floor leaving annixter and hilma alone deserted their arms about each other face to face with delaney mad with alcohol bursting with remembered insult bent on evil reckless of results
after the first scramble for safety the crowd fell quiet for the fraction of an instant glued to the walls afraid to stir struck dumb and motionless with surprise and terror and in the instants silence that followed annixter his eyes on delaney muttered rapidly to hilma get back get away to one side
the fool shoot
there was a seconds respite afforded while delaney occupied himself in quieting the buckskin and in that second of time at this moment of crisis the wonderful thing occurred
hilma turning from delaney her hands clasped on arm her eyes meeting his exclaimed you too
and that was all but to annixter it was a revelation
never more alive to his surroundings never more observant he suddenly understood
for the briefest lapse of time he and hilma looked deep into each others eyes and from that moment on annixter knew that hilma cared
the whole matter was brief as the snapping of a finger
two words and a glance and all was done
but as though nothing had occurred annixter pushed hilma from him repeating harshly get back i tell you you see hes got a gun
i enough on my hands without you
he loosed her clasp and his eyes once more on delaney moved diagonally backwards toward the side of the barn pushing hilma from him
in the end he thrust her away so sharply that she gave back with a long stagger somebody caught her arm and drew her in leaving annixter alone once more in the middle of the floor his hands in his coat pockets watchful alert facing his enemy
but the cowpuncher was not ready to come to grapples yet
fearless his wits gambolling under the lash of the alcohol he wished to make the most of the occasion maintaining the suspense playing for the gallery
by touches of the hand and knee he kept the buckskin in continual nervous movement her hoofs clattering snorting tossing her head while he himself addressing himself to annixter poured out a torrent of invective
well strike me blind if it ainot old buck annixter
he was going to show me off quien sabe at the toe of his boot was he
well heres your the ladies to see you do it
gives a dance does he highfalutin hoedown in his barn and forgets to invite his old bronchobustin friend
but his friend donot forget him no he donot
he remembers little things does his bronchobustin friend
likes to see a dance hisself on occasion his friend does
comes anyhow trustin his welcome will be hearty just to see old buck annixter dance just to show buck friends how buck can all by hisself a little dance when his bronchobustin friend asks him so polite
a little dance for the ladies buck
this feature of the entertainment is alone worth the price of admission
tune up buck
attention now give you the key
he fanned his revolver spinning it about his index finger by the triggerguard with incredible swiftness the twirling weapon a mere blur of blue steel in his hand
suddenly and without any apparent cessation of the movement he fired and a little splinter of wood flipped into the air at feet
time he shouted while the buckskin reared to the report
hold a minute
this place is too light to suit
that big light yonder is in my eyes
look out going to throw lead
a second shot put out the lamp over the musicians stand
the assembled guests shrieked a frantic shrinking quiver ran through the crowd like the huddling of frightened rabbits in their pen
annixter hardly moved
he stood some thirty paces from the buster his hands still in his coat pockets his eyes glistening watchful
excitable and turbulent in trifling matters when actual bodily danger threatened he was of an abnormal quiet watching you cried the other make any mistake about that
keep your hands in your pockets if youd like to live a little longer understand
and donot let me see you make a move toward your hip or your friends will be asked to identify you at the morgue tomorrow morning
when bad called the friend so i am and that bad tonight that scared of myself have to revise the census returns before done with this place
come on now getting tired waiting
i come to see a dance
hand over that horse delaney said annixter without raising his voice and clear out
the other affected to be overwhelmed with infinite astonishment his eyes staring
he peered down from the saddle he exclaimed did you say
why i guess you must be looking for trouble thats what i guess where youre wrong mson muttered annixter partly to delaney partly to himself
if i was looking for trouble there wouldnot be any guesswork about it
with the words he began firing
delaney had hardly entered the barn before plan had been formed
long since his revolver was in the pocket of his coat and he fired now through the coat itself without withdrawing his hands
until that moment annixter had not been sure of himself
there was no doubt that for the first few moments of the affair he would have welcomed with joy any reasonable excuse for getting out of the situation
but the sound of his own revolver gave him confidence
he whipped it from his pocket and fired again
abruptly the duel began report following report spurts of pale blue smoke jetting like the darts of short spears between the two men expanding to a haze and drifting overhead in wavering strata
it was quite probable that no thought of killing each other suggested itself to either annixter or delaney
both fired without aiming very deliberately
to empty their revolvers and avoid being hit was the desire common to both
they no longer vituperated each other
the revolvers spoke for them
long after annixter could recall this moment
for years he could with but little effort reconstruct the densely packed crowd flattened against the sides of the barn the festoons of lanterns the mingled smell of evergreens new wood sachets and powder smoke the vague clamour of distress and terror that rose from the throng of guests the squealing of the buckskin the uneven explosions of the revolvers the reverberation of trampling hoofs a brief glimpse of harran excited face at the door of the harness room and in the open space in the centre of the floor himself and delaney manoeuvring swiftly in a cloud of smoke revolver contained but six cartridges
already it seemed to him as if he had fired twenty times
without doubt the next shot was his last
then what
he peered through the blue haze that with every discharge thickened between him and the buster
for his own safety he must place at least one shot chest and shoulders rose suddenly above the smoke close upon him as the distraught buckskin reared again
annixter for the first time during the fight took definite aim but before he could draw the trigger there was a great shout and he was aware of the buckskin the bridle trailing the saddle empty plunging headlong across the floor crashing into the line of chairs
delaney was scrambling off the floor
there was blood on the busters wrist and he no longer carried his revolver
suddenly he turned and ran
the crowd parted right and left before him as he made toward the doorway
he disappeared
twenty men promptly sprang to the buckskins head but she broke away and wild with terror bewildered blind insensate charged into the corner of the barn by the musicians stand
she brought up against the wall with cruel force and with impact of a sack of stones her head was cut
she turned and charged again bulllike the blood streaming from her forehead
the crowd shrieking melted before her rush
an old man was thrown down and trampled
the buckskin trod upon the dragging bridle somersaulted into a confusion of chairs in one corner and came down with a terrific clatter in a wild disorder of kicking hoofs and splintered wood
but a crowd of men fell upon her tugging at the bit sitting on her head shouting gesticulating
for five minutes she struggled and fought then by degrees she recovered herself drawing great sobbing breaths at long intervals that all but burst the girths rolling her eyes in bewildered supplicating fashion trembling in every muscle and starting and shrinking now and then like a young girl in hysterics
at last she lay quiet
the men allowed her to struggle to her feet
the saddle was removed and she was led to one of the empty stalls where she remained the rest of the evening her head low her pasterns quivering turning her head apprehensively from time to time showing the white of one eye and at long intervals heaving a single prolonged sigh
and an hour later the dance was progressing as evenly as though nothing in the least extraordinary had occurred
the incident was abrupt swoop of terror and impending death dropping down there from out the darkness cutting abruptly athwart the gayety of the moment come and gone with the swiftness of a thunderclap
many of the women had gone home taking their men with them but the great bulk of the crowd still remained seeing no reason why the episode should interfere with the evenings enjoyment resolved to hold the ground for mere bravado if for nothing else
delaney would not come back of that everybody was persuaded and in case he should there was not found wanting fully half a hundred young men who would give him a dressing down by jingo
they had been too surprised to act when delaney had first appeared and before they knew where they were at the buster had cleared out
in another minute just another second they would have shown himyes sir by jingoah you bet
on all sides the reminiscences began to circulate
at least one man in every three had been involved in a gun fight at some time of his life
ah you ought to have seen in yuba county one time why in butte county in the early days pshaw this tonight wasnot anything
why once in a saloon in arizona when i was there and so on over and over again
osterman solemnly asserted that he had seen a greaser sawn in two in a nevada sawmill
old broderson had witnessed a vigilante lynching in on california street in san francisco
dyke recalled how once in his engineering days he had run over a drunk at a street crossing
gethings of the san pablo had taken a shot at a highwayman
hooven had bayonetted a french chasseur at sedan
an old spanishmexican a centenarian from guadalajara remembered stand on a mountain top in san benito county
the druggist had fired at a burglar trying to break into his store one new eve
young vacca had seen a dog shot in guadalajara
father sarria had more than once administered the sacraments to portuguese desperadoes dying of gunshot wounds
even the women recalled terrible scenes
mrs cutter recounted to an interested group how she had seen a claim jumped in placer county in when three men were shot falling in a fusillade of rifle shots and expiring later upon the floor of her kitchen while she looked on
mrs dyke had been in a stage holdup when the shotgun messenger was murdered
stories by the hundreds went the round of the company
the air was surcharged with blood dying groans the reek of powder smoke the crack of rifles
all the legends of the violent wild life of the early days were recalled to view defiling before them there in an endless procession under the glare of paper lanterns and kerosene lamps
but the affair had aroused a combative spirit amongst the men of the assembly
instantly a spirit of aggression of truculence swelled up underneath waistcoats and starched shirt bosoms
more than one offender was promptly asked to step outside
it was like young bucks excited by an encounter of stags lowering their horns upon the slightest provocation showing off before the does and fawns
old quarrels were remembered
one sought laboriously for slights and insults veiled in ordinary conversation
the sense of personal honour became refined to a delicate fine point
upon the slightest pretext there was a haughty drawing up of the figure a twisting of the lips into a smile of scorn
caraher spoke of shooting behrman on sight before the end of the week
twice it became necessary to separate hooven and cutter renewing their quarrel as to the ownership of the steer
all at once minna partner fell upon the gayly apparelled clerk from bonneville pummelling him with his fists hustling him out of the hall vociferating that miss hooven had been grossly insulted
it took three men to extricate the clerk from his clutches dazed gasping his collar unfastened and sticking up into his face his eyes staring wildly into the faces of the crowd
but annixter bursting with pride his chest thrown out his chin in the air reigned enthroned in a circle of adulation
he was the hero
to shake him by the hand was an honour to be struggled for
one clapped him on the back with solemn nods of approval the for you there was nerve for you the matter with annixter
how about for sand and how was for a why apache kid couldnot have bettered that
cool enough
took a steady eye and a sure hand to make a shot like that
there was a shot that would be told about in tulare county fifty years to come
annixter had refrained from replying all ears to this conversation wondering just what had happened
he knew only that delaney had run leaving his revolver and a spatter of blood behind him
by degrees however he ascertained that his last shot but one had struck pistol hand shattering it and knocking the revolver from his grip
he was overwhelmed with astonishment
why after the shooting began he had not so much as seen delaney with any degree of plainness
the whole affair was a whirl
well where did learn to shoot way some one in the crowd demanded
annixter moved his shoulders with a gesture of vast unconcern
oh he observed carelessly not my that ever worried mson
the crowd gaped with delight
there was a great wagging of heads
well i guess not
no sir not much
ah no you bet not
when the women pressed around him shaking his hands declaring that he had saved their daughters lives annixter assumed a pose of superb deprecation the modest selfobliteration of the chevalier
he delivered himself of a remembered phrase very elegant refined
it was lancelot after the tournament bayard receiving felicitations after the battle
oh donot say anything about it he murmured only did what any man would have done in my place
to restore completely the equanimity of the company he announced supper
this he had calculated as a tremendous surprise
it was to have been served at midnight but the irruption of delaney had dislocated the order of events and the tables were brought in an hour ahead of time
they were arranged around three sides of the barn and were loaded down with cold roasts of beef cold chickens and cold ducks mountains of sandwiches pitchers of milk and lemonade entire cheeses bowls of olives plates of oranges and nuts
the advent of this supper was received with a volley of applause
the musicians played a quick step
the company threw themselves upon the food with a great scraping of chairs and a vast rustle of muslins tarletans and organdies soon the clatter of dishes was a veritable uproar
the tables were taken by assault
one ate whatever was nearest at hand some even beginning with oranges and nuts and ending with beef and chicken
at the end the paper caps were brought on together with the ice cream
all up and down the tables the pulled crackers snapped continually like the discharge of innumerable tiny rifles
the caps of tissue paper were put bonnets magicians caps liberty caps the young girls looked across the table at their with bursts of laughter and vigorous clapping of the hands
the harness room crowd had a table to themselves at the head of which sat annixter and at the foot harran
the gun fight had sobered presley thoroughly
he sat by the side of vanamee who ate but little preferring rather to watch the scene with calm observation a little contemptuous when the uproar around the table was too boisterous savouring of intoxication
osterman rolled bullets of bread and shot them with astonishing force up and down the table but the old broderson caraher harran derrick hooven cutter garnett of the ruby rancho keast from the ranch of the same name gethings of the san pablo and chattern of the themselves with eating as much as they could before the supper gave out
at a corner of the table speechless unobserved ignored sat dabney of whom nothing was known but his name the silent old man who made no friends
he ate and drank quietly dipping his sandwich in his lemonade
osterman ate all the olives he could lay his hands on a score of them fifty of them a hundred of them
he touched no crumb of anything else
old broderson stared at him his jaw fallen
osterman declared he had once eaten a thousand on a bet
the men called each others attention to him
delighted to create a sensation osterman persevered
the contents of an entire bowl disappeared in his huge reptilian slit of a mouth
his cheeks of brownish red were extended his bald forehead glistened
colics seized upon him
his stomach revolted
it was all one with him
he was satisfied contented
he was astonishing the people
once i swallowed a tree toad he told old broderson by mistake
i was eating grapes and the beggar lived in me three weeks
in rainy weather he would sing
you donot believe that he vociferated
i got the toad at home now in a bottle of alcohol
and the old man never doubting his eyes starting wagged his head in amazement
oh yes cried caraher the length of the table a pretty good one
tell us another
that reminds me of a story hazarded old broderson uncertainly once when i was a lad in ukiah fifty years
oh yes cried half a dozen voices a pretty good one
tell us another murmured broderson looking about him donot know
it was ukiah mix me all up
as soon as supper was over the floor was cleared again
the guests clamoured for a virginia reel
the last quarter of the evening the time of the most riotous fun was beginning
the young men caught the girls who sat next to them
the orchestra dashed off into a rollicking movement
the two lines were formed
in a second of time the dance was under way again the guests still wearing the phrygian bonnets and liberty caps of pink and blue tissue paper
but the group of men once more adjourned to the harness room
fresh boxes of cigars were opened the seventh bowl of fertiliser was mixed
osterman poured the dregs of a glass of it upon his bald head declaring that he could feel the hair beginning to grow
but suddenly old broderson rose to his feet
aha he cackled going to have a dance i am
think too old show you young fellows a regular old when i get started
he marched out into the barn the others following holding their sides
he found an aged mexican woman by the door and hustled her all confused and giggling into the virginia reel then at its height
every one crowded around to see
old broderson stepped off with the alacrity of a colt snapping his fingers slapping his thigh his mouth widening in an excited grin
the entire company of the guests shouted
the city band redoubled their efforts and the old man losing his head breathless gasping dislocated his stiff joints in his efforts
he became possessed bowing scraping advancing retreating wagging his beard cutting pigeons wings distraught with the music the clamour the applause the effects of the fertiliser
annixter shouted nice eye santa claus
but attention wandered
he searched for hilma tree having still in mind the look in her eyes at that swift moment of danger
he had not seen her since then
at last he caught sight of her
she was not dancing but instead was sitting with her partner at the end of the barn near her father and mother her eyes wide a serious expression on her face her thoughts no doubt elsewhere
annixter was about to go to her when he was interrupted by a cry
old broderson in the midst of a double shuffle had clapped his hand to his side with a gasp which he followed by a whoop of anguish
he had got a stitch or had started a twinge somewhere
with a gesture of resignation he drew himself laboriously out of the dance limping abominably one leg dragging
he was heard asking for his wife
old mrs broderson took him in charge
she jawed him for making an exhibition of himself scolding as though he were a tenyearold
well i want to know she exclaimed as he hobbled off dejected and melancholy leaning upon her arm thought he had to dance indeed
what next
a gay old grandpa this better be thinking of his coffin
it was almost midnight
the dance drew towards its close in a storm of jubilation
the perspiring musicians toiled like galley slaves the guests singing as they danced
the group of men reassembled in the harness room
even magnus derrick condescended to enter and drink a toast
presley and vanamee still holding themselves aloof looked on vanamee more and more disgusted
dabney standing to one side overlooked and forgotten continued to sip steadily at his glass solemn reserved
garnett of the ruby rancho keast from the ranch of the same name gethings of the san pablo and chattern of the bonanza leaned back in their chairs their waistcoats unbuttoned their legs spread wide could not tell why
other ranchers men whom annixter had never seen appeared in the room wheat growers from places as far distant as goshen and pixley young men and old proprietors of veritable principalities hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat lands a dozen of them a score of them men who were strangers to each other but who made it a point to shake hands with magnus derrick the prominent man of the valley
old broderson whom every one had believed had gone home returned though much sobered and took his place refusing however to drink another spoonful
soon the entire number of guests found themselves in two companies the dancers on the floor of the barn frolicking through the last figures of the virginia reel and the boisterous gathering of men in the harness room downing the last quarts of fertiliser
both assemblies had been increased
even the older people had joined in the dance while nearly every one of the men who did not dance had found their way into the harness room
the two groups rivalled each other in their noise
out on the floor of the barn was a very whirlwind of gayety a tempest of laughter handclapping and cries of amusement
in the harness room the confused shouting and singing the stamping of heavy feet set a quivering reverberation in the oil of the kerosene lamps the flame of the candles in the japanese lanterns flaring and swaying in the gusts of hilarity
at intervals between the two one heard the music the wailing of the violins the vigorous snarling of the cornet and the harsh incessant rasping of the snare drum
and at times all these various sounds mingled in a single vague note huge clamorous that rose up into the night from the colossal reverberating compass of the barn and sent its echoes far off across the unbroken levels of the surrounding ranches stretching out to infinity under the clouded sky calm mysterious still
annixter the punch bowl clasped in his arms was pouring out the last spoonful of liquor into glass when he was aware that some one was pulling at the sleeve of his coat
he set down the punch bowl
well where did come from he demanded
it was a messenger from bonneville the uniformed boy that the telephone company employed to carry messages
he had just arrived from town on his bicycle out of breath and panting
message for you sir
will you sign
he held the book to annixter who signed the receipt wondering
the boy departed leaving a thick envelope of yellow paper in hands the address typewritten the word urgent written in blue pencil in one corner
annixter tore it open
the envelope contained other sealed envelopes some eight or ten of them addressed to magnus derrick osterman broderson garnett keast gethings chattern dabney and to annixter himself
still puzzled annixter distributed the envelopes muttering to himself up now
the incident had attracted attention
a comparative quiet followed the guests following the letters with their eyes as they were passed around the table
they fancied that annixter had arranged a surprise
magnus derrick who sat next to annixter was the first to receive his letter
with a word of excuse he opened it
read it read it governor shouted a halfdozen voices
no secrets you know
everything above board here tonight
magnus cast a glance at the contents of the letter then rose to his feet and read magnus derrick bonneville tulare co cal
dear sir by regrade of october 1st the value of the railroad land you occupy included in your ranch of los muertos has been fixed at per acre
the land is now for sale at that price to any one
yours etc land agent and local agent and in the midst of the profound silence that followed osterman was heard to exclaim grimly a pretty good one
tell us another
but for a long moment this was the only remark
the silence widened broken only by the sound of torn paper as annixter osterman old broderson garnett keast gethings chattern and dabney opened and read their letters
they were all to the same effect almost word for word like the only the figures and the proper names varied
in some cases the price per acre was twentytwo dollars
in case it was thirty the company promised to sell to me all of us gasped old broderson at a an acre
it was not alone the ranchers immediately around bonneville who would be plundered by this move on the part of the railroad
the alternate section system applied throughout all the san joaquin
by striking at the bonneville ranchers a terrible precedent was established
of the crowd of guests in the harness room alone nearly every man was affected every man menaced with ruin
all of a million acres was suddenly involved
then suddenly the tempest burst
a dozen men were on their feet in an instant their teeth set their fists clenched their faces purple with rage
oaths curses maledictions exploded like the firing of successive mines
voices quivered with wrath hands flung upward the fingers hooked prehensile trembled with anger
the sense of wrongs the injustices the oppression extortion and pillage of twenty years suddenly culminated and found voice in a raucous howl of execration
for a second there was nothing articulate in that cry of savage exasperation nothing even intelligent
it was the human animal hounded to its corner exploited harried to its last stand at bay ferocious terrible turning at last with bared teeth and upraised claws to meet the death grapple
it was the hideous squealing of the tormented brute its back to the wall defending its lair its mate and its whelps ready to bite to rend to trample to batter out the life of the enemy in a primeval bestial welter of blood and fury
the roar subsided to intermittent clamour in the pauses of which the sounds of music and dancing made themselves audible once more
behrman again vociferated harran derrick
chose his moment well muttered annixter
hits his hardest when were all rounded up having a good time
gentlemen this is ruin to be done now
my god do you think we are going to stand this
do you think we the uproar swelled again
the clearer the assembly of ranchers understood the significance of this move on the part of the railroad the more terrible it appeared the more flagrant the more intolerable
was it possible was it within the bounds of imagination that this tyranny should be contemplated
but they years had driven home the implacable iron monster with whom they had to deal and again and again the sense of outrage and oppression lashed them to their feet their mouths wide with curses their fists clenched tight their throats hoarse with shouting
fight
how fight
what you going to do
if theres a law in this land if there is it is in pocket
who owns the courts in california it shelgrim
god damn him
well how long are you going to stand it
how long before youll settle up accounts with six inches of plugged gaspipe
and our contracts the solemn pledges of the corporation to sell to us first of all and now the land is for sale to anybody
why it is a question of my home
am i to be turned out
why i have put eight thousand dollars into improving this land
and i six thousand and now that i have the railroad grabs it

think i am to get off my land
by god gentlemen law or no law railroad or no railroad nor nor nor this is the last
legal means first if those shotgun
they can kill me
they can shoot me down but fighting for my give in to this
at length annixter made himself heard all out of the room but the ranch owners he shouted
hooven caraher dyke youll have to clear out
this is a family affair
presley you and your friend can remain
reluctantly the others filed through the door
there remained in the harness vanamee and derrick annixter old broderson harran garnett from the ruby rancho keast from the ranch of the same name gethings of the san pablo chattern of the bonanza about a score of others ranchers from various parts of the county and last of all dabney ignored silent to whom nobody spoke and who as yet had not uttered a word
but the men who had been asked to leave the harness room spread the news throughout the barn
it was repeated from lip to lip
one by one the guests dropped out of the dance
groups were formed
by swift degrees the gayety lapsed away
the virginia reel broke up
the musicians ceased playing and in the place of the noisy effervescent revelry of the previous half hour a subdued murmur filled all the barn a mingling of whispers lowered voices the coming and going of light footsteps the uneasy shifting of positions while from behind the closed doors of the harness room came a prolonged sullen hum of anger and strenuous debate
the dance came to an abrupt end
the guests unwilling to go as yet stunned distressed stood clumsily about their eyes vague their hands swinging at their sides looking stupidly into each others faces
a sense of impending calamity oppressive foreboding gloomy passed through the air overhead in the night a long shiver of anguish and of terror mysterious despairing
in the harness room however the excitement continued unchecked
one rancher after another delivered himself of a torrent of furious words
there was no order merely the frenzied outcry of blind fury
one spirit alone was common to at whatever cost and to whatever lengths
suddenly osterman leaped to his feet his bald head gleaming in the lamplight his red ears distended a flood of words filling his great horizontal slit of a mouth his comic actors face flaming
like the hero of a melodrama he took stage with a great sweeping gesture he shouted that must be our watchword
the curse of the ranchers is that they fritter away their strength
now we must stand together now the crisis heres the moment
shall we meet it
i not next week not tomorrow not in the morning but now now now this very moment before we go out of that door
every one of us here to join it to form the beginnings of a vast organisation banded together to death if needs be for the protection of our rights and homes
are you ready
is it now or never
i call for the league
instantly there was a shout
with an actors instinct osterman had spoken at the precise psychological moment
he carried the others off their feet glib dexterous voluble
just what was meant by the league the others did not know but it was something a vague engine a machine with which to fight
osterman had not done speaking before the room rang with outcries the crowd of men shouting for what they did not know
the league
the league
now tonight this moment sign our names before we leave right
organisation
the league
we have a committee at work already osterman vociferated am a member and also mr broderson mr annixter and mr harran derrick
what our aims are we will explain to you later
let this committee be the nucleus of the at least
trust us
we are working for you and with you
let this committee be merged into the larger committee of the league and for president of the paused the fraction of a president there can be but one name mentioned one man to whom we all must look as derrick
the name was received with a storm of cheers
the harness room reechoed with shouts of derrick
derrick
magnus for president
derrick our natural leader
derrick derrick derrick for president
magnus rose to his feet
he made no gesture
erect as a cavalry officer tall thin commanding he dominated the crowd in an instant
there was a moments hush
gentlemen he said if organisation is a good word moderation is a better one
the matter is too grave for haste
i would suggest that we each and severally return to our respective homes for the night sleep over what has happened and convene again tomorrow when we are calmer and can approach this affair in a more judicious mood
as for the honour with which you would inform me i must affirm that that too is a matter for grave deliberation
this league is but a name as yet
to accept control of an organisation whose principles are not yet fixed is a heavy responsibility
i shrink from it but he was allowed to proceed no farther
a storm of protest developed
there were shouts of no no
the league tonight and derrick for president
we have been moderate too long
the league first principles afterward
we canot wait declared osterman
many of us cannot attend a meeting tomorrow
our business affairs would prevent it
now we are all together
i propose a temporary chairman and secretary be named and a ballot be taken
but first the league
let us draw up a set of resolutions to stand together for the defence of our homes to death if needs be and each man present affix his signature thereto
he subsided amidst vigorous applause
the next quarter of an hour was a vague confusion every one talking at once conversations going on in low tones in various corners of the room
ink pens and a sheaf of foolscap were brought from the ranch house
a set of resolutions was draughted having the force of a pledge organising the league of defence
annixter was the first to sign
others followed only a few holding back refusing to join till they had thought the matter over
the roll grew the paper circulated about the table each signature was welcomed by a salvo of cheers
at length it reached harran derrick who signed amid tremendous uproar
he released the pen only to shake a score of hands
now magnus derrick
gentlemen began the governor once more rising beg of you to allow me further consideration
gentlemen he was interrupted by renewed shouting
no no now or never
sign join the league leave us
we look to you to help
but presently the excited throng that turned their faces towards the governor were aware of a new face at his elbow
the door of the harness room had been left unbolted and mrs derrick unable to endure the heartbreaking suspense of waiting outside had gathered up all her courage and had come into the room
trembling she clung to arm her pretty lightbrown hair in disarray her large young girls eyes wide with terror and distrust
what was about to happen she did not understand but these men were clamouring for magnus to pledge himself to something to some terrible course of action some ruthless unscrupulous battle to the death with the ironhearted monster of steel and steam
nerved with a cowards intrepidity she who so easily obliterated herself had found her way into the midst of this frantic crowd into this hot close room reeking of alcohol and tobacco smoke into this atmosphere surcharged with hatred and curses
she seized her husbands arm imploring distraught with terror
no no she murmured no donot sign
she was the feather caught in the whirlwind
en masse the crowd surged toward the erect figure of the governor the pen in one hand his wifes fingers in the other the roll of signatures before him
the clamour was deafening the excitement culminated brusquely
half a hundred hands stretched toward him thirty voices at top pitch implored expostulated urged almost commanded
the reverberation of the shouting was as the plunge of a cataract
it was the uprising of the people the thunder of the outbreak of revolt the mob demanding to be led aroused at last imperious resistless overwhelming
it was the blind fury of insurrection the brute manytongued redeyed bellowing for guidance baring its teeth unsheathing its claws imposing its will with the abrupt resistless pressure of the relaxed piston inexorable knowing no pity
no no implored annie derrick
no magnus donot sign
he must declared harran shouting in her ear to make himself heard he must you understand
again the crowd surged forward roaring
mrs derrick was swept back pushed to one side
her husband no longer belonged to her
she paid the penalty for being the wife of a great man
the world like a colossal iron wedge crushed itself between
she was thrust to the wall
the throng of men stamping surrounded magnus she could no longer see him but terrorstruck she listened
there was a moments lull then a vast thunder of savage jubilation
magnus had signed
harran found his mother leaning against the wall her hands shut over her ears her eyes dilated with fear brimming with tears
he led her from the harness room to the outer room where mrs tree and hilma took charge of her and then impatient refusing to answer the hundreds of anxious questions that assailed him hurried back to the harness room
already the balloting was in progress osterman acting as temporary chairman on the very first ballot he was made secretary of the league pro tem and magnus unanimously chosen for its president
an executive committee was formed which was to meet the next day at the los muertos ranch house
it was halfpast one oclock
in the barn outside the greater number of the guests had departed
long since the musicians had disappeared
there only remained the families of the ranch owners involved in the meeting in the harness room
these huddled in isolated groups in corners of the garish echoing barn the women in their wraps the young men with their coat collars turned up against the draughts that once more made themselves felt
for a long half hour the loud hum of eager conversation continued to issue from behind the door of the harness room
then at length there was a prolonged scraping of chairs
the session was over
the men came out in groups searching for their families
at once the homeward movement began
every one was worn out
some of the ranchers daughters had gone to sleep against their mothers shoulders
billy the stableman and his assistant were awakened and the teams were hitched up
the stable yard was full of a maze of swinging lanterns and buggy lamps
the horses fretted champing the bits the carryalls creaked with the straining of leather and springs as they received their loads
at every instant one heard the rattle of wheels as vehicle after vehicle disappeared in the night
a fine drizzling rain was falling and the lamps began to show dim in a vague haze of orange light
magnus derrick was the last to go
at the doorway of the barn he found annixter the roll of it had been decided he was to keep in his safe for the his arm
silently the two shook hands
magnus departed
the grind of the wheels of his carryall grated sharply on the gravel of the driveway in front of the ranch house then with a hollow roll across a little plank bridge gained the roadway
for a moment the beat of the horses hoofs made itself heard on the roadway
it ceased
suddenly there was a great silence
annixter in the doorway of the great barn stood looking about him for a moment alone thoughtful
the barn was empty
that astonishing evening had come to an end
the whirl of things and people the crowd of dancers delaney the gun fight hilma tree her eyes fixed on him in mute confession the rabble in the harness room the news of the regrade the fierce outburst of wrath the hasty organising of the league all went spinning confusedly through his recollection
but he was exhausted
time enough in the morning to think it all over
by now it was raining sharply
he put the roll of names into his inside pocket threw a sack over his head and shoulders and went down to the ranch house
but in the harness room lighted by the glittering lanterns and flaring lamps in the midst of overturned chairs spilled liquor cigar stumps and broken glasses vanamee and presley still remained talking talking
at length they rose and came out upon the floor of the barn and stood for a moment looking about them
billy the stableman was going the rounds of the walls putting out light after light
by degrees the vast interior was growing dim
upon the roof overhead the rain drummed incessantly the eaves dripping
the floor was littered with pine needles bits of orange peel ends and fragments of torn organdies and muslins and bits of tissue paper from the phrygian bonnets and liberty caps
the buckskin mare in the stall dozing on three legs changed position with a long sigh
the sweat stiffening the hair upon her back and loins as it dried gave off a penetrating ammoniacal odour that mingled with the stale perfume of sachet and wilted flowers
presley and vanamee stood looking at the deserted barn
there was a long silence
then presley said well what do you think of it all think answered vanamee slowly think that there was a dance in brussels the night before waterloo
i in his office at san francisco seated before a massive desk of polished redwood very ornate lyman derrick sat dictating letters to his typewriter on a certain morning early in the spring of the year
the subdued monotone of his voice proceeded evenly from sentence to sentence regular precise businesslike have the honour to acknowledge herewith your favour of the 14th instant and in reply would state please find enclosed draft upon new orleans to be applied as per our understanding in answer to your favour no referring to the case of the city and county of san francisco against excelsior warehouse storage co i would say his voice continued expressionless measured distinct
while he spoke he swung slowly back and forth in his leather swivel chair his elbows resting on the arms his pop eyes fixed vaguely upon the calendar on the opposite wall winking at intervals when he paused searching for a word all for the present he said at length
without reply the typewriter rose and withdrew thrusting her pencil into the coil of her hair closing the door behind her softly discreetly
when she had gone lyman rose stretching himself putting up three fingers to hide his yawn
to further loosen his muscles he took a couple of turns the length of he room noting with satisfaction its fine appointments the padded red carpet the dull olive green tint of the walls the few choice of marshall taney field and a coloured the grand canyon of the deepseated leather chairs the large and crowded bookcase topped with a bust of james lick and a huge greenish globe the waste basket of woven coloured grass made by navajo indians the massive silver inkstand on the desk the elaborate filing cabinet complete in every particular and the shelves of tin boxes padlocked impressive grave bearing the names of clients cases and estates
he was between thirtyone and thirtyfive years of age
unlike harran he resembled his mother but he was much darker than annie derrick and his eyes were much fuller the eyeball protruding giving him a popeyed foreign expression quite unusual and unexpected
his hair was black and he wore a small tight pointed mustache which he was in the habit of pushing delicately upward from the corners of his lips with the ball of his thumb the little finger extended
as often as he made this gesture he prefaced it with a little twisting gesture of the forearm in order to bring his cuff into view and in fact this movement by itself was habitual
he was dressed carefully his trousers creased a pink rose in his lapel
his shoes were of patent leather his cutaway coat was of very rough black cheviot his doublebreasted waistcoat of tan covered cloth with buttons of smoked pearl
an ascot great puff of heavy black at his neck the knot transfixed by a tiny golden pin set off with an opal and four small diamonds
at one end of the room were two great windows of plate glass and pausing at length before one of these lyman selected a cigarette from his curved box of oxydized silver lit it and stood looking down and out willing to be idle for a moment amused and interested in the view
his office was on the tenth floor of the a beautiful towerlike affair of white stone that stood on the corner of market street near its intersection with kearney the most imposing office building of the city
below him the city swarmed tumultuous through its grooves the cablecars starting and stopping with a gay jangling of bells and a strident whirring of jostled glass windows
drays and carts clattered over the cobbles and an incessant shuffling of thousands of feet rose from the pavement
around fountain the baskets of the flower sellers crammed with chrysanthemums violets pinks roses lilies hyacinths set a brisk note of colour in the grey of the street
but to notion the general impression of this centre of the citys life was not one of strenuous business activity
it was a continuous interest in small things a people ever willing to be amused at trifles refusing to consider serious mattersgoodnatured allowing themselves to be imposed upon taking life easilygenerous companionable enthusiastic living as it were from day to day in a place where the luxuries of life were had without effort in a city that offered to consideration the restlessness of a new york without its earnestness the serenity of a naples without its languor the romance of a seville without its picturesqueness
as lyman turned from the window about to resume his work the office boy appeared at the door
the man from the lithograph company sir announced the boy
well what does he want demanded lyman adding however upon the instant show him in
a young man entered carrying a great bundle which he deposited on a chair with a gasp of relief exclaiming all out of breath from the standard lithograph company
what is know replied the other
maps i guess donot want any maps
who sent them
i guess youre mistaken
lyman tore the cover from the top of the package drawing out one of a great many huge sheets of white paper folded eight times
suddenly he uttered an exclamation ah i see
they maps
but these should not have come here
they are to go to the regular office for distribution
he wrote a new direction on the label of the package take them to that address he went on keep this one here
the others go to that address
if you see mr darrell tell him that mr get the derrick may not be able to get around this afternoon but to go ahead with any business just the same
the young man departed with the package and lyman spreading out the map upon the table remained for some time studying it thoughtfully
it was a commissioners official railway map of the state of california completed to march 30th of that year
upon it the different railways of the state were accurately plotted in various colours blue green yellow
however the blue the yellow and the green were but brief traceries very short isolated unimportant
at a little distance these could hardly be seen
the whole map was gridironed by a vast complicated network of red lines marked and these centralised at san francisco and thence ramified and spread north east and south to every quarter of the state
from coles in the topmost corner of the map to yuma in the lowest from reno on one side to san francisco on the other ran the plexus of red a veritable system of blood circulation complicated dividing and reuniting branching splitting extending throwing out feelers offshoots tap roots little blood suckers that shot out from the main jugular and went twisting up into some remote county laying hold upon some forgotten village or town involving it in one of a myriad branching coils one of a hundred tentacles drawing it as it were toward that centre from which all this system sprang
the map was white and it seemed as if all the colour which should have gone to vivify the various counties towns and cities marked upon it had been absorbed by that huge sprawling organism with its ruddy arteries converging to a central point
it was as though the state had been sucked white and colourless and against this pallid background the red arteries of the monster stood out swollen with lifeblood reaching out to infinity gorged to bursting an excrescence a gigantic parasite fattening upon the lifeblood of an entire commonwealth
however in an upper corner of the map appeared the names of the three new commissioners jones for the first district lyman derrick for the second and james darrell for the third
nominated in the democratic state convention in the fall of the preceding year lyman backed by the coteries of san francisco bosses in the pay of his fathers political committee of ranchers had been elected together with darrell the candidate of the pueblo and mojave road and the avowed candidate of the pacific and southwestern
darrell was rabidly against the and rabidly for it
lyman was supposed to be the conservative member of the board the ranchers candidate it was true and faithful to their interests but a calm man deliberative swayed by no such violent emotions as his colleagues dexterity had at last succeeded in entangling magnus inextricably in the new politics
the famous league organised in the heat of passion the night of barn dance had been consolidated all through the winter months
its executive committee of which magnus was chairman had been through manipulation merged into the old committee composed of broderson annixter and himself
promptly thereat he had resigned the chairmanship of this committee thus leaving magnus at its head
precisely as osterman had planned magnus was now one of them
the new committee accordingly had two objects in view to resist the attempted grabbing of their lands by the railroad and to push forward their own secret scheme of electing a board of railroad commissioners who should regulate wheat rates so as to favour the ranchers of the san joaquin
the land cases were promptly taken to the courts and the new the price of the lands at twenty and thirty dollars an acre instead of and stubbornly fought
but delays occurred the process of the law was interminable and in the intervals the committee addressed itself to the work of seating the ranchers commission as the projected board of commissioners came to be called
it was harran who first suggested that his brother lyman be put forward as the candidate for this district
at once the proposition had a great success
lyman seemed made for the place
while allied by every tie of blood to the ranching interests he had never been identified with them
he was citybred
the railroad would not be oversuspicious of him
he was a good lawyer a good business man keen clearheaded farsighted had already some practical knowledge of politics having served a term as assistant district attorney and even at the present moment occupying the position of sheriffs attorney
more than all he was the son of magnus derrick he could be relied upon could be trusted implicitly to remain loyal to the ranchers cause
the campaign for railroad commissioner had been very interesting
at the very outset committee found itself involved in corrupt politics
the primaries had to be captured at all costs and by any means and when the convention assembled it was found necessary to buy outright the votes of certain delegates
the campaign fund raised by contributions from magnus annixter broderson and osterman was drawn upon to the extent of five thousand dollars
only the committee knew of this corruption
the league ignoring ways and means supposed as a matter of course that the campaign was honorably conducted
for a whole week after the consummation of this part of the deal magnus had kept to his house refusing to be seen alleging that he was ill which was not far from the truth
the shame of the business the loathing of what he had done were to him things unspeakable
he could no longer look harran in the face
he began a course of deception with his wife
more than once he had resolved to break with the whole affair resigning his position allowing the others to proceed without him
but now it was too late
he was pledged
he had joined the league
he was its chief and his defection might mean its disintegration at the very time when it needed all its strength to fight the land cases
more than a mere deal in bad politics was involved
there was the land grab
his withdrawal from an unholy cause would mean the weakening perhaps the collapse of another cause that he believed to be righteous as truth itself
he was hopelessly caught in the mesh
wrong seemed indissolubly knitted into the texture of right
he was blinded dizzied overwhelmed caught in the current of events and hurried along he knew not where
he resigned himself
in the end and after much ostentatious opposition on the part of the railroad heelers lyman was nominated and subsequently elected
when this consummation was reached magnus osterman broderson and annixter stared at each other
their wildest hopes had not dared to fix themselves upon so easy a victory as this
it was not believable that the corporation would allow itself to be fooled so easily would rush openeyed into the trap
how had it happened
osterman however threw his hat into the air with wild whoops of delight
old broderson permitted himself a feeble cheer
even magnus beamed satisfaction
the other members of the league present at the time shook hands all around and spoke of opening a few bottles on the strength of the occasion
annixter alone was recalcitrant too easy he declared
no not satisfied
shelgrim in all this
why donot he show his hand damn his soul
the thing is yellow i tell you a big fish in these waters somewheres
i donot know his name and i donot know his game but hes moving round off and on just out of sight
if you think youve netted him i thats all got to say
but he was jeered down as a croaker
there was the commission
he couldnot get around that could he
there was darrell and lyman derrick both pledged to the ranches
good lord he was never satisfied be obstinate till the very last gun was fired
why if he got drowned in a river hed float upstream just to be contrary
in the course of time the new board was seated
for the first few months of its term it was occupied in clearing up the business left over by the old board and in the completion of the railway map
but now the decks were cleared
it was about to address itself to the consideration of a revision of the tariff for the carriage of grain between the san joaquin valley and tidewater
both lyman and darrell were pledged to an average ten per cent cut of the grain rates throughout the entire state
the typewriter returned with the letters for lyman to sign and he put away the map and took up his mornings routine of business wondering the while what would become of his practice during the time he was involved in the business of the ranchers railroad commission
but towards noon at the moment when lyman was drawing off a glass of mineral water from the siphon that stood at his elbow there was an interruption
some one rapped vigorously upon the door which was immediately after opened and magnus and harran came in followed by presley
hello hello cried lyman jumping up extending his hands why heres a surprise
i didnot expect you all till tonight
come in come in and sit down
have a glass of sizzwater governor
the others explained that they had come up from bonneville the night before as the executive committee of the league had received a despatch from the lawyers it had retained to fight the railroad that the judge of the court in san francisco where the test cases were being tried might be expected to hand down his decision the next day
very soon after the announcement of the new grading of the ranchers lands the corporation had offered through behrman to lease the disputed lands to the ranchers at a nominal figure
the offer had been angrily rejected and the railroad had put up the lands for sale at office in bonneville
at the exorbitant price named buyers promptly buyers beyond shadow of doubt acting either for the railroad or for hitherto unknown in the county men without property without money adventurers heelers
prominent among them and bidding for the railroads holdings included on ranch was delaney
the farce of deeding the corporations sections to these fictitious purchasers was solemnly gone through with at office the railroad guaranteeing them possession
the league refused to allow the supposed buyers to come upon the land and the railroad faithful to its pledge in the matter of guaranteeing its dummies possession at once began suits in ejectment in the district court in visalia the county seat
it was the preliminary skirmish the reconnaisance in force the combatants feeling each others strength willing to proceed with caution postponing the actual deathgrip for a while till each had strengthened its position and organised its forces
during the time the cases were on trial at visalia behrman was much in evidence in and about the courts
the trial itself after tedious preliminaries was brief
the ranchers lost
the test cases were immediately carried up to the united states circuit court in san francisco
at the moment the decision of this court was pending
why this is news exclaimed lyman in response to the announcement did not expect them to be so prompt
i was in court only last week and there seemed to be no end of business ahead
i suppose you are very anxious
magnus nodded
he had seated himself in one of deep chairs his grey tophat with its wide brim on the floor beside him
his coat of black broadcloth that had been tightly packed in his valise was yet wrinkled and creased his trousers were strapped under his high boots
as he spoke he stroked the bridge of his hawklike nose with his bent forefinger in his chair he watched his two sons with secret delight
to his eye both were perfect specimens of their class intelligent welllooking resourceful
he was intensely proud of them
he was never happier never more nearly jovial never more erect more military more alert and buoyant than when in the company of his two sons
he honestly believed that no finer examples of young manhood existed throughout the entire nation think we should win in this court harran observed watching the bubbles break in his glass
the investigation has been much more complete than in the visalia trial
our case this time is too good
it has made too much talk
the court would not dare render a decision for the railroad
why theres the agreement in black and the circulars the railroad issued
how one get around those
well well we shall know in a few hours now remarked magnus
oh exclaimed lyman surprised it is for this morning then
why arenot you at the court
it seemed undignified boy answered the governor
we shall know soon enough
good god exclaimed harran abruptly when i think of what is involved
why lyman its our home the ranch house itself nearly all los muertos practically our whole fortune and just now when there is promise of an enormous crop of wheat
and it is not only us
there are over half a million acres of the san joaquin involved
in some cases of the smaller ranches it is the confiscation of the whole of the ranchers land
if this thing goes through it will absolutely beggar nearly a hundred men
broderson wouldnot have a thousand acres to his name
why its monstrous
but the corporations offered to lease these lands remarked lyman
are any of the ranchers taking up that are any of them buying outright
buying
at the new figure exclaimed harran at twenty and thirty an acre
why theres not one in ten that they are landpoor
and as for land they virtually ownno theres precious few are doing that thank god
that would be acknowledging the railroads ownership right their rights for good
none of the are doing it i know
that would be the rankest treachery
he paused for a moment drinking the rest of the mineral water then interrupting lyman who was about to speak to presley drawing him into the conversation through politeness said matters are just romping right along to a crisis these days a make or break for the wheat growers of the state now no mistake
here are the land cases and the new grain tariff drawing to a head at about the same time
if we win our land cases theres your new freight rates to be applied and then all is beer and skittles the san joaquin go wild if we pull it off and i believe we will
how we wheat growers are exploited and trapped and deceived at every turn observed magnus sadly
the courts the capitalists the railroads each of them in turn hoodwinks us into some new and wonderful scheme only to betray us in the end
well he added turning to lyman one thing at least we can depend on
we will cut their grain rates for them eh lyman
lyman crossed his legs and settled himself in his office chair have wanted to have a talk with you about that sir he said
yes we will cut the average per cent cut throughout the state as we are pledged
but i am going to warn you governor and you harran donot expect too much at first
the man who even after twenty years training in the operation of railroads can draw an equitable smoothly working schedule of freight rates between shipping point and common point is capable of governing the united states
what with main lines and leased lines and points of transfer and the laws governing common carriers and the rulings of the interstate commerce commission the whole matter has become so confused that vanderbilt himself couldnot straighten it out
and how can it be expected that railroad commissions who are chosenwell lets be ours was for instance from out a number of men who donot know the difference between a switching charge and a differential rate are going to regulate the whole business in six months time
cut rates yes any fool can do that any fool can write one dollar instead of two but if you cut too low by a fraction of one per cent and if the railroad can get out an injunction tie you up and show that your new rate prevents the road being operated at a profit how are you any better off
your conscientiousness does you credit lyman said the governor respect you for it my son
i know you will be fair to the railroad
that is all we want
fairness to the corporation is fairness to the farmer and we wonot expect you to readjust the whole matter out of hand
take your time
we can afford to wait
and suppose the next commission is a railroad board and reverses all our figures
the onetime mining king the most redoubtable poker player of calaveras county permitted himself a momentary twinkle of his eyes
by then it will be too late
we will all of us have made our fortunes by then
the remark left presley astonished out of all measure he never could accustom himself to these strange lapses in the character
magnus was by nature a public man judicious deliberate standing firm for principle yet upon rare occasion by some such remark as this he would betray the presence of a subnature of recklessness inconsistent all at variance with his creeds and tenets
at the very bottom when all was said and done magnus remained the deep down in his heart the spirit of the adventurer yet persisted
we will all of us have made fortunes by then
that was it precisely
after us the deluge
for all his public spirit for all his championship of justice and truth his respect for law magnus remained the gambler willing to play for colossal stakes to hazard a fortune on the chance of winning a million
it was the true california spirit that found expression through him the spirit of the west unwilling to occupy itself with details refusing to wait to be patient to achieve by legitimate plodding the miners instinct of wealth acquired in a single night prevailed in spite of all
it was in this frame of mind that magnus and the multitude of other ranchers of whom he was a type farmed their ranches
they had no love for their land
they were not attached to the soil
they worked their ranches as a quarter of a century before they had worked their mines
to husband the resources of their marvellous san joaquin they considered niggardly petty hebraic
to get all there was out of the land to squeeze it dry to exhaust it seemed their policy
when at last the land worn out would refuse to yield they would invest their money in something else by then they would all have made fortunes
they did not care
after us the deluge
lyman however was obviously uneasy willing to change the subject
he rose to his feet pulling down his cuffs
by the way he observed want you three to lunch with me today at my club
it is close by
you can wait there for news of the courts decision as well as anywhere else and i should like to show you the place
i have just joined
at the club when the four men were seated at a small table in the round window of the main room popularity with all classes was very apparent
hardly a man entered that did not call out a salutation to him some even coming over to shake his hand
he seemed to be every mans friend and to all he seemed equally genial
his affability even to those whom he disliked was unfailing
see that fellow yonder he said to magnus indicating a certain middleaged man flamboyantly dressed who wore his hair long who was afflicted with sore eyes and the collar of whose velvet coat was sprinkled with dandruff hartrath the artist a man absolutely devoid of even the commonest decency
how he got in here is a mystery to me
yet when this hartrath came across to say how do you do to lyman lyman was as eager in his cordiality as his warmest friend could have expected
why the devil are you so chummy with him then observed harran when hartrath had gone away explanation was vague
the truth of the matter was that oldest son was consumed by inordinate ambition
political preferment was his dream and to the realisation of this dream popularity was an essential
every man who could vote blackguard or gentleman was to be conciliated if possible
he made it his study to become known throughout the entire put influential men under obligations to himself
he never forgot a name or a face
with everybody he was the hailfellowwellmet
his ambition was not trivial
in his disregard for small things he resembled his father
municipal office had no attraction for him
his goal was higher
he had planned his life twenty years ahead
already attorney assistant district attorney and railroad commissioner he could if he desired attain the office of district attorney itself
just now it was a question with him whether or not it would be politic to fill this office
would it advance or sidetrack him in the career he had outlined for himself
lyman wanted to be something better than district attorney better than mayor than state senator or even than member of the united states congress
he wanted to be in fact what his father was only in succeed where magnus had failed
he wanted to be governor of the state
he had put his teeth together and deaf to all other considerations blind to all other issues he worked with the infinite slowness the unshakable tenacity of the coral insect to this one end
after luncheon was over lyman ordered cigars and liqueurs and with the three others returned to the main room of the club
however their former place in the round window was occupied
a middleaged man with iron grey hair and moustache who wore a frock coat and a white waistcoat and in some indefinable manner suggested a retired naval officer was sitting at their table smoking a long thin cigar
at sight of him presley became animated
he uttered a mild exclamation why isnot that mr cedarquist
cedarquist repeated lyman derrick know him well
yes of course it is he continued
governor you must know him
he is one of our representative men
you would enjoy talking to him
he was the head of the big atlas iron works
they have shut down recently you know
not failed exactly but just ceased to be a paying investment and cedarquist closed them out
he has other interests though a rich capitalist
lyman brought the group up to the gentleman in question and introduced them
mr magnus derrick of course observed cedarquist as he took the hand known you by repute for some time sir
this is a great pleasure i assure you
then turning to presley he added hello pres my boy
how is the great the very great poem getting on not getting on at all sir answered presley in some embarrassment as they all sat down
in fact about given up the idea so much interest in what you might call living issues down at los muertos now that getting further and further from it every day should say as much remarked the manufacturer turning towards magnus watching your fight with shelgrim mr derrick with every degree of interest
he raised his drink of whiskey and soda success to you
as he replaced his glass the artist hartrath joined the group uninvited
as a pretext he engaged lyman in conversation
lyman he believed was a man with a pull at the city hall
in connection with a projected milliondollar fair and flower festival which at that moment was the talk of the city certain statues were to be erected and hartrath bespoke influence to further the pretensions of a sculptor friend of his who wished to be art director of the affair
in the matter of this fair and flower festival hartrath was not lacking in enthusiasm
he addressed the others with extravagant gestures blinking his inflamed eyelids million dollars he exclaimed
hey think of that
why do you know that we have five hundred thousand practically pledged already
talk about public spirit gentlemen this is the most publicspirited city on the continent
and the money is not thrown away
we will have eastern visitors here by the with money to invest
the million we spend on our fair will be money in our pockets
ah you should see how the women of this city are taking hold of the matter
they are giving all kinds of little entertainments teas olde tyme singing skules amateur theatricals gingerbread fetes all for the benefit of the fund and the business men out their money like water
it is splendid splendid to see a community so patriotic
the manufacturer cedarquist fixed the artist with a glance of melancholy interest
and how much he remarked will they gingerbread women and publicspirited capitalists towards the blowing up of the ruins of the atlas iron works
blowing up
i donot understand murmured the artist surprised
when you get your eastern capitalists out here with your milliondollar fair continued cedarquist you donot propose do you to let them see a milliondollar iron foundry standing idle because of the indifference of san francisco business men
they might ask pertinent questions your capitalists and we should have to answer that our business men preferred to invest their money in corner lots and government bonds rather than to back up a legitimate industrial enterprise
we donot want fairs
we want active furnaces
we donot want public statues and fountains and park extensions and gingerbread fetes
we want business enterprise it like us it like us he exclaimed sadly
what a melancholy comment
san francisco
it is not a is a midway plaisance
california likes to be fooled
do you suppose shelgrim could convert the whole san joaquin valley into his back yard otherwise
indifference to public indifference it stamps us all
our state is the very paradise of fakirs
you and your milliondollar fair
he turned to hartrath with a quiet smile
it is just such men as you mr hartrath that are the ruin of us
you organise a sham of tinsel and pasteboard put on fools cap and bells beat a gong at a street corner and the crowd cheers you and drops nickels into your hat
your gingerbread fete yes i saw it in full blast the other night on the grounds of one of your womens places on sutter street
i was on my way home from the last board meeting of the atlas company
a gingerbread fete my god and the atlas plant shutting down for want of financial backing
a million dollars spent to attract the eastern investor in order to show him an abandoned rolling mill wherein the only activity is the sale of remnant material and scrap steel
lyman however interfered
the situation was becoming strained
he tried to conciliate the three artist the manufacturer and the farmer the warring elements
but hartrath unwilling to face the enmity that he felt accumulating against him took himself away
a picture of study of the contra costa to be raffled in the club rooms for the benefit of the fair
he himself was in charge of the matter
he disappeared
cedarquist looked after him with contemplative interest
then turning to magnus excused himself for the acridity of his words no worse than many others and the people of this state and city are after all only a little more addleheaded than other americans
it was his favourite topic
sure of the interest of his hearers he unburdened himself
if i were to name the one crying evil of american life mr derrick he continued it would be the indifference of the better people to public affairs
it is so in all our great centres
there are other great trusts god knows in the united states besides our own dear and railroad
every state has its own grievance
if it is not a railroad trust it is a sugar trust or an oil trust or an industrial trust that exploits the people the indifference of the people is the opportunity of the despot
it is as true as that the whole is greater than the part and the maxim is so old that it is is laughable
it is neglected and disused for the sake of some new ingenious and complicated theory some wonderful scheme of reorganisation but the fact remains nevertheless simple fundamental everlasting
the people have but to say no and not the strongest tyranny political religious or financial that was ever organised could survive one week
the others absorbed attentive approved nodding their heads in silence as the manufacturer finished one reason mr derrick the other resumed after a moment why i have been so glad to meet you
you and your league are trying to say no to the trust
i hope you will succeed
if your example will rally the people to your cause you will
otherwise he shook his head
one stage of the fight is to be passed this very day observed magnus
my sons and myself are expecting hourly news from the city hall a decision in our case is pending
we are both of us fighters it seems mr derrick said cedarquist
each with his particular enemy
we are well met indeed the farmer and the manufacturer both in the same grist between the two millstones of the lethargy of the public and the aggression of the trust the two great evils of modern america
pres my boy there is your epic poem ready to hand
but cedarquist was full of another idea
rarely did so favourable an opportunity present itself for explaining his theories his ambitions
addressing himself to magnus he continued fortunately for myself the atlas company was not my only investment
i have other interests
the building of sailing been an ambition of this purpose mr derrick to carry american wheat
for years i have studied this question of american wheat and at last i have arrived at a theory
let me explain
at present all our california wheat goes to liverpool and from that port is distributed over the world
but a change is coming
i am sure of it
you young men he turned to presley lyman and harran will live to see it
our century is about done
the great word of this nineteenth century has been production
the great word of the twentieth century will to me you as a market for our let me take a concrete a market for our europe is played out
population in europe is not increasing fast enough to keep up with the rapidity of our production
in some cases as in france the population is stationary however have gone on producing wheat at a tremendous rate
the result is overproduction
we supply more than europe can eat and down go the prices
the remedy is in the curtailing of our wheat areas but in this we for years we have been sending our wheat from east to west from california to europe
but the time will come when we must send it from west to east
we must march with the course of empire not against it
i mean we must look to china
rice in china is losing its nutritive quality
the asiatics though must be fed if not on rice then on wheat
why mr derrick if only onehalf the population of china ate a half ounce of flour per man per day all the wheat areas in california could not feed them
ah if i could only hammer that into the brains of every rancher of the san joaquin yes and of every owner of every bonanza farm in dakota and minnesota
send your wheat to china handle it yourselves do away with the middleman break up the chicago wheat pits and elevator rings and mixing houses
when in feeding china you have decreased the european shipments the effect is instantaneous
prices go up in europe without having the least effect upon the prices in china
we hold the key we have the more than we ourselves can eat
asia and europe must look to america to be fed
what fatuous neglect of opportunity to continue to deluge europe with our surplus food when the east trembles upon the verge of starvation
the two men cedarquist and magnus continued the conversation a little further
the manufacturers idea was new to the governor
he was greatly interested
he withdrew from the conversation
thoughtful he leaned back in his place stroking the bridge of his beaklike nose with a crooked forefinger
cedarquist turned to harran and began asking details as to the conditions of the wheat growers of the san joaquin
lyman still maintained an attitude of polite aloofness yawning occasionally behind three fingers and presley was left to the company of his own thoughts
there had been a day when the affairs and grievances of the farmers of his annixter osterman and old filled him only with disgust
his mind full of a great vague epic poem of the west he had kept himself apart disdainful of what he chose to consider their petty squabbles
but the scene in harness room had thrilled and uplifted him
he was palpitating with excitement all through the succeeding months
he abandoned the idea of an epic poem
in six months he had not written a single verse
day after day he trembled with excitement as the relations between the trust and league became more and more strained
he saw the matter in its true light
it was typical
it was the worldold war between freedom and tyranny and at times his hatred of the railroad shook him like a crisp and withered reed while the languid indifference of the people of the state to the quarrel filled him with a blind exasperation
but as he had once explained to vanamee he must find expression
he felt that he would suffocate otherwise
he had begun to keep a journal
as the inclination spurred him he wrote down his thoughts and ideas in this sometimes every day sometimes only three or four times a month
also he flung aside his books of tennyson browning even addressed himself to mill malthus young poushkin henry george schopenhauer
he attacked the subject of social inequality with unbounded enthusiasm
he devoured rather than read and emerged from the affair his mind a confused jumble of conflicting notions sick with overeffort raging against injustice and oppression and with not one sane suggestion as to remedy or redress
the butt of his cigarette scorched his fingers and roused him from his brooding
in the act of lighting another he glanced across the room and was surprised to see two very prettily dressed young women in the company of an older gentleman in a long frock coat standing before painting examining it their heads upon one side
presley uttered a murmur of surprise
he himself was a member of the club and the presence of women within its doors except on special occasions was not tolerated
he turned to lyman derrick for an explanation but this other had also seen the women and abruptly exclaimed declare i had forgotten about it
why this is ladies day of course
why yes interposed cedarquist glancing at the women over his shoulder you know
they let em in twice a year you remember and this is a double occasion
they are going to raffle the benefit of the gingerbread fair
why you are not up to date lyman
this is a sacred and religious important public event
of course of course murmured lyman
he found means to survey harran and magnus
certainly neither his father nor his brother were dressed for the function that impended
he had been stupid
magnus invariably attracted attention and now with his trousers strapped under his boots his wrinkled frock twisted his cuffs into sight with an impatient nervous movement of his wrists glancing a second time at his brothers pink face forward curling yellow hair and clothes of a country cut
but there was no help for it
he wondered what were the club regulations in the matter of bringing in visitors on ladies day
sure enough ladies day he remarked am very glad you struck it governor
we can sit right where we are
i guess this is as good a place as any to see the crowd a good chance to see all the big guns of the city
do you expect your people here mr cedarquist
my wife may come and my daughters said the manufacturer
ah murmured presley so much the better
i was going to give myself the pleasure of calling upon your daughters mr cedarquist this afternoon
you can save your carfare pres said cedarquist you will see them here
no doubt the invitations for the occasion had appointed one oclock as the time for between that hour and two the guests arrived in an almost unbroken stream
from their point of vantage in the round window of the main room magnus his two sons and presley looked on very interested
cedarquist had excused himself affirming that he must look out for his women folk
of every ten of the arrivals seven at least were ladies
they entered the unfamiliar masculine haunt where their husbands brothers and sons spent so much of their a certain show of hesitancy and little nervous oblique glances moving their heads from side to side like a file of hens venturing into a strange barn
they came in groups ushered by a single member of the club doing the honours with effusive bows and polite gestures indicating the various objects of interest pictures busts and the like that decorated the room
fresh from his recollections of bonneville guadalajara and the dance in barn presley was astonished at the beauty of these women and the elegance of their toilettes
the crowd thickened rapidly
a murmur of conversation arose subdued gracious mingled with the soft rustle of silk grenadines velvet
the scent of delicate perfumes spread in the air violet de parme peau colours of the most harmonious blends appeared and disappeared at intervals in the slowly moving press touches of lavendertinted velvets pale violet crepes and creamcoloured appliqued laces
there seemed to be no need of introductions
everybody appeared to be acquainted
there was no awkwardness no constraint
the assembly disengaged an impression of refined pleasure
on every hand innumerable dialogues seemed to go forward easily and naturally without break or interruption witty engaging the couple never at a loss for repartee
a third party was gracefully included then a fourth
little groups were that divided themselves or melted into other groups or disintegrated again into isolated pairs or lost themselves in the background of the without friction without whole affair going forward of itself decorous tactful wellbred
at a distance and not too loud a stringed orchestra sent up a pleasing hum
waiters with brass buttons on their full dress coats went from group to group silent unobtrusive serving salads and ices
but the focus of the assembly was the little space before painting
it was called study of the contra costa foothills and was set in a frame of natural redwood the bark still adhering
it was conspicuously displayed on an easel at the right of the entrance to the main room of the club and was very large
in the foreground and to the left under the shade of a liveoak stood a couple of reddish cows kneedeep in a patch of yellow poppies while in the righthand corner to balance the composition was placed a girl in a pink dress and white sunbonnet in which the shadows were indicated by broad dashes of pale blue paint
the ladies and young girls examined the production with little murmurs of admiration hazarding remembered phrases searching for the exact balance between generous praise and critical discrimination expressing their opinions in the mild technicalities of the art books and painting classes
they spoke of atmospheric effects of middle distance of chiarooscuro of foreshortening of the decomposition of light of the subordination of individuality to fidelity of interpretation
one tall girl with hair almost white in its blondness having observed that the handling of the masses reminded her strongly of corot her companion who carried a gold lorgnette by a chain around her neck answered ah
millet perhaps but not corot
this verdict had an immediate success
it was passed from group to group
it seemed to imply a delicate distinction that carried conviction at once
it was decided formally that the reddish brown cows in the picture were reminiscent of daubigny and that the handling of the masses was altogether millet but that the general effect was not quite corot
presley curious to see the painting that was the subject of so much discussion had left the group in the round window and stood close by hartrath craning his head over the shoulders of the crowd trying to catch a glimpse of the reddish cows the milkmaid and the blue painted foothills
he was suddenly aware of voice in his ear and turning about found himself face to face with the manufacturer his wife and his two daughters
there was a meeting
salutations were exchanged presley shaking hands all around expressing his delight at seeing his old friends once more for he had known the family from his boyhood mrs cedarquist being his aunt
mrs cedarquist and her two daughters declared that the air of los muertos must certainly have done him a world of good
he was stouter there could be no doubt of it
a little pale perhaps
he was fatiguing himself with his writing no doubt
ah he must take care
health was everything after all
had he been writing any more verse
every month they scanned the magazines looking for his name
mrs cedarquist was a fashionable woman the president or chairman of a score of clubs
she was forever running after fads appearing continually in the society wherein she moved with new and astounding whom she unearthed no one knew where discovering them long in advance of her companions
now it was a russian countess with dirty finger nails who travelled throughout america and borrowed money now an aesthete who possessed a wonderful collection of topaz gems who submitted decorative schemes for the interior arrangement of houses and who received in mrs drawingrooms dressed in a white velvet cassock now a widow of some mohammedan of bengal or rajputana who had a blue spot in the middle of her forehead and who solicited contributions for her sisters in affliction now a certain bearded poet recently back from the klondike now a decayed musician who had been ejected from a young ladies musical conservatory of europe because of certain surprising pamphlets on free love and who had come to san francisco to introduce the community to the music of brahms now a japanese youth who wore spectacles and a grey flannel shirt and who at intervals delivered himself of the most astonishing poems vague unrhymed unmetrical lucubrations incoherent bizarre now a christian scientist a lean grey woman whose creed was neither christian nor scientific now a university professor with the bristling beard of an anarchist chiefofsection and a roaring guttural voice whose intenseness left him gasping and apoplectic now a civilised cherokee with a mission now a female elocutionist whose forte was songs of greece now a high caste chinaman now a miniature painter now a tenor a pianiste a mandolin player a missionary a drawing master a virtuoso a collector an armenian a botanist with a new flower a critic with a new theory a doctor with a new treatment
and all these people had a veritable mania for declamation and fancy dress
the russian countess gave talks on the prisons of siberia wearing the headdress and pinchbeck ornaments of a slav bride the aesthete in his white cassock gave readings on obscure questions of art and ethics
the widow of india in the costume of her caste described the social life of her people at home
the bearded poet perspiring in furs and boots of reindeer skin declaimed verses of his own composition about the wild life of the alaskan mining camps
the japanese youth in the silk robes of the samurai twosworded nobles read from his own flatbordered earth nailed down at night rusting under the darkness the brave upright rains that came down like errands from ironbodied yoretime
the christian scientist in funereal impressive black discussed the contrawill and panpsychic hylozoism
the university professor put on a full dress suit and lisle thread gloves at three in the afternoon and before literary clubs and circles bellowed extracts from goethe and schiler in the german shaking his fists purple with vehemence
the cherokee arrayed in fringed buckskin and blue beads rented from a costumer intoned folk songs of his people in the vernacular
the elocutionist in cheesecloth toga and tin bracelets rendered the isles of greece where burning sappho loved and sung
the chinaman in the robes of a mandarin lectured on confucius
the armenian in fez and baggy trousers spoke of the unspeakable turk
the mandolin player dressed like a bull fighter held musical conversaziones interpreting the peasant songs of andalusia
it was the fake the eternal irrepressible sham glib nimble ubiquitous tricked out in all the paraphernalia of imposture an endless defile of charlatans that passed interminably before the gaze of the city marshalled by lady presidents exploited by clubs of women by literary societies reading circles and culture organisations
the attention the fake received the time devoted to it the money which it absorbed were incredible
it was all one that impostor after impostor was exposed it was all one that the clubs the circles the societies were proved beyond doubt to have been swindled
the more the philistine press of the city railed and guyed the more the women rallied to the defence of their protege of the hour
that their favourite was persecuted was to them a veritable rapture
promptly they invested the apostle of culture with the glamour of a martyr
the fakirs worked the community as shellgame tricksters work a county fair departing with bursting pocketbooks passing on the word to the next in line assured that the place was not worked out knowing well that there was enough for all
more frequently the public of the city unable to think of more than one thing at one time prostrated itself at the feet of a single apostle but at other moments such as the present when a flower festival or a milliondollar fair aroused enthusiasm in all quarters the occasion was one of gala for the entire fake
the decayed professors virtuosi litterateurs and artists thronged to the place en masse
their clamour filled all the air
on every hand one heard the scraping of violins the tinkling of mandolins the suave accents of art talks the incoherencies of poets the declamation of elocutionists the inarticulate wanderings of the japanese the confused mutterings of the cherokee the guttural bellowing of the german university professor all in the name of the milliondollar fair
money to the extent of hundreds of thousands was set in motion
mrs cedarquist was busy from morning until night
one after another she was introduced to newly arrived fakirs
to each poet to each litterateur to each professor she addressed the same question how long have you known you had this power
she spent her days in one quiver of excitement and jubilation
she was in the movement
the people of the city were awakening to a realisation of the beautiful to a sense of the higher needs of life
this was art this was literature this was culture and refinement
the renaissance had appeared in the west
she was a short rather stout redfaced very much overdressed little woman of some fifty years
she was rich in her own name even before her marriage being a relative of shelgrim himself and on familiar terms with the great financier and his family
her husband while deploring the policy of the railroad saw no good reason for quarrelling with shelgrim and on more than one occasion had dined at his house
on this occasion delighted that she had come upon a minor poet she insisted upon presenting him to hartrath
you two should have so much in common she explained
presley shook the flaccid hand of the artist murmuring conventionalities while mrs cedarquist hastened to say am sure you know mr verse mr hartrath
you should believe me
you two have much in common
i can see so much that is alike in your modes of interpreting nature
in mr sonnet the better part there is the same note as in your picture the same sincerity of tone the same subtlety of touch the same nuancesah
oh my dear madame murmured the artist interrupting impatient retort am a mere bungler
you donot mean quite that i am sure
i am too sensitive
it is my cross
beauty he closed his sore eyes with a little expression of pain beauty unmans me
but mrs cedarquist was not listening
her eyes were fixed on the artists luxuriant hair a thick and glossy mane that all but covered his coat collar
leonine she murmured leonine
like samson of old
however abruptly bestirring herself she exclaimed a second later but i must run away
i am selling tickets for you this afternoon mr hartrath
i am having such success already
mr presley you will take two chances i am sure and oh by the way i have such good news
you know i am one of the lady members of the subscription committee for our fair and you know we approached mr shelgrim for a donation to help along
oh such a liberal patron a real lorenzo di medici
in the name of the pacific and southwestern he has subscribed think of it five thousand dollars and yet they will talk of the meanness of the railroad
possibly it is to his interest murmured presley
the fairs and festivals bring people to the city over his railroad
but the others turned on him expostulating
ah you philistine declared mrs cedarquist
and this from presley to attribute such base motives if the poets become materialised mr presley declared hartrath what can we say to the people
and shelgrim encourages your milliondollar fairs and fetes said a voice at elbow because it is throwing dust in the peoples eyes
the group turned about and saw cedarquist who had come up unobserved in time to catch the drift of the talk
but he spoke without bitterness there was even a goodhumoured twinkle in his eyes
yes he continued smiling our dear shelgrim promotes your fairs not only as pres says because it is money in his pocket but because it amuses the people distracts their attention from the doings of his railroad
when beatrice was a baby and had little colics i used to jingle my keys in front of her nose and it took her attention from the pain in her tummy so shelgrim
the others laughed goodhumouredly protesting nevertheless and mrs cedarquist shook her finger in warning at the artist and exclaimed the philistines be upon thee samson
by the way observed hartrath willing to change the subject hear you are on the famine relief committee
does your work progress
oh most famously i assure you she said
such a movement as we have started
those poor creatures
the photographs of them are simply dreadful
i had the committee to luncheon the other day and we passed them around
we are getting subscriptions from all over the state and mr cedarquist is to arrange for the ship
the relief committee in question was one of a great number that had been formed in all over the union for the matter of provide relief for the victims of a great famine in central india
the whole world had been struck with horror at the reports of suffering and mortality in the affected districts and had hastened to send aid
certain women of san francisco with mrs cedarquist at their head had organised a number of committees but the manufacturers wife turned the meetings of these committees into social affairsluncheons teas where one discussed the ways and means of assisting the starving asiatics over teacups and plates of salad
shortly afterward a mild commotion spread throughout the assemblage of the clubs guests
the drawing of the numbers in the raffle was about to be made
hartrath in a flurry of agitation excused himself
cedarquist took presley by the arm
pres lets get out of this he said
come into the wine room and i will shake you for a glass of sherry
they had some difficulty in extricating themselves
the main room where the drawing was to take place suddenly became densely thronged
all the guests pressed eagerly about the table near the picture upon which one of the hall boys had just placed a ballot box containing the numbers
the ladies holding their tickets in their hands pushed forward
a staccato chatter of excited murmurs arose
what became of harran and lyman and the governor inquired presley
lyman had disappeared alleging a business engagement but magnus and his younger son had retired to the library of the club on the floor above
it was almost deserted
they were deep in earnest conversation
harran said the governor with decision there is a deal there in what cedarquist says
our wheat to china hey boy
it is certainly worth thinking of sir
it appeals to me boy it appeals to me big and theres a fortune in it
big chances mean big returns and i old father isnot a back number yet may not have so wide an outlook as our friend cedarquist but i am quick to see my chance
boy the whole east is opening disintegrating before the anglosaxon
it is time that bread stuffs as well should make markets for themselves in the orient
just at this moment too when lyman will scale down freight rates so we can haul to tidewater at little cost
magnus paused again his frown beetling and in the silence the excited murmur from the main room of the club the soprano chatter of a multitude of women found its way to the deserted library believe its worth looking into governor asserted harran
magnus rose and his hands behind him paced the floor of the library a couple of times his imagination all stimulated and vivid
the great gambler perceived his chance the kaleidoscopic shifting of circumstances that made a situation
it had come silently unexpectedly
he had not seen its approach
abruptly he woke one morning to see the combination realised
but also he saw a vision
a sudden and abrupt revolution in the wheat
a new world of markets discovered the matter as important as the discovery of america
the torrent of wheat was to be diverted flowing back upon itself in a sudden colossal eddy stranding the middleman the the elevatorand mixinghouse men dry and despairing their occupation gone
he saw the farmer suddenly emancipated the worlds food no longer at the mercy of the speculator thousands upon thousands of men set free of the grip of trust and ring and monopoly acting for themselves selling their own wheat organising into one gigantic trust themselves sending their agents to all the entry ports of china
himself annixter broderson and osterman would pool their issues
he would convince them of the magnificence of the new movement
they would be its pioneers
harran would be sent to hong kong to represent the four
they would ship perhaps one of american built the nations flag at the peak and the sailing of that ship gorged with the crops from and ranches from quien sabe and los muertos would be like the sailing of the caravels from palos
it would mark a new era it would make an epoch
with this vision still expanding before the eye of his mind magnus with harran at his elbow prepared to depart
they descended to the lower floor and involved themselves for a moment in the throng of fashionables that blocked the hallway and the entrance to the main room where the numbers of the raffle were being drawn
near the head of the stairs they encountered presley and cedarquist who had just come out of the wine room
magnus still on fire with the new idea pressed a few questions upon the manufacturer before bidding him goodbye
he wished to talk further upon the great subject interested as to details but cedarquist was vague in his replies
he was no farmer he hardly knew wheat when he saw it only he knew the trend of the worlds affairs he felt them to be setting inevitably eastward
however his very vagueness was a further inspiration to the governor
he swept details aside
he saw only the grand coup the huge results the east conquered the march of empire rolling westward finally arriving at its starting point the vague mysterious orient
he saw his wheat like the crest of an advancing billow crossing the pacific bursting upon asia flooding the orient in a golden torrent
it was the new era
he had lived to see the death of the old and the birth of the new first the mine now the ranch first gold now wheat
once again he became the pioneer hardy brilliant taking colossal chances blazing the way grasping a million in a single day
all the bigness of his nature leaped up again within him
at the magnitude of the inspiration he felt young again indomitable the leader at last king of his fellows wresting from fortune at this eleventh hour before his old age the place of high command which so long had been denied him
at last he could achieve
abruptly magnus was aware that some one had spoken his name
he looked about and saw behind him at a little distance two gentlemen strangers to him
they had withdrawn from the crowd into a little recess
evidently having no women to look after they had lost interest in the afternoons affair
magnus realised that they had not seen him
one of them was reading aloud to his companion from an evening edition of that days newspaper
it was in the course of this reading that magnus caught the sound of his name
he paused listening and presley harran and cedarquist followed his example
soon they all understood
they were listening to the report of the judges decision for which magnus was decision in the case of the league vs the railroad
for the moment the polite clamour of the raffle hushed winning number was being drawn
the guests held their breath and in the ensuing silence magnus and the others heard these words distinctly it follows that the title to the lands in question is in the pacific and southwestern railroad and the defendants have no title and their possession is wrongful
there must be findings and judgment for the plaintiff and it is so ordered
in spite of himself magnus paled
harran shut his teeth with an oath
their exaltation of the previous moment collapsed like a pyramid of cards
the vision of the new movement of the wheat the conquest of the east the invasion of the orient seemed only the flimsiest mockery
with a brusque wrench they were snatched back to reality
between them and the vision between the fecund san joaquin reeking with fruitfulness and the millions of asia crowding toward the verge of starvation lay the ironhearted monster of steel and steam implacable insatiable entrails gorged with the life blood that it sucked from an entire commonwealth its ever hungry maw glutted with the harvests that should have fed the famished bellies of the whole world of the orient
but abruptly while the four men stood there gazing into each others faces a vigorous handclapping broke out
the raffle of picture was over and as presley turned about he saw mrs cedarquist and her two daughters signalling eagerly to the manufacturer unable to reach him because of the intervening crowd
then mrs cedarquist raised her voice and cried won won
unnoticed and with but a brief word to cedarquist magnus and harran went down the marble steps leading to the street door silent arm tight around his fathers shoulder
at once the orchestra struck into a lively air
a renewed murmur of conversation broke out and cedarquist as he said goodbye to presley looked first at the retreating figures of the ranchers then at the gayly dressed throng of beautiful women and debonair young men and indicating the whole scene with a single gesture said smiling sadly as he spoke not a city presley not a city but a midway plaisance
underneath the long trestle where broderson creek cut the line of the railroad and the upper road the ground was low and covered with a second growth of grey green willows
along the borders of the creek were occasional marshy spots and now and then hilma tree came here to gather watercresses which she made into salads
the place was picturesque secluded an oasis of green shade in all the limitless flat monotony of the surrounding wheat lands
the creek had eroded deep into the little gully and no matter how hot it was on the baking shimmering levels of the ranches above down here one always found ones self enveloped in an odorous moist coolness
from time to time the incessant murmur of the creek pouring over and around the larger stones was interrupted by the thunder of trains roaring out upon the trestle overhead passing on with the furious gallop of their hundreds of iron wheels leaving in the air a taint of hot oil acrid smoke and reek of escaping steam
on a certain afternoon in the spring of the year hilma was returning to quien sabe from by the trail that led from los muertos to ranch houses under the trestle
she had spent the afternoon with minna hooven who for the time being was kept indoors because of a wrenched ankle
as hilma descended into the gravel flats and thickets of willows underneath the trestle she decided that she would gather some cresses for her supper that night
she found a spot around the base of one of the supports of the trestle where the cresses grew thickest and plucked a couple of handfuls washing them in the creek and pinning them up in her handkerchief
it made a little round cold bundle and hilma warm from her walk found a delicious enjoyment in pressing the damp ball of it to her cheeks and neck
for all the change that annixter had noted in her upon the occasion of the barn dance hilma remained in many things a young child
she was never at loss for enjoyment and could always amuse herself when left alone
just now she chose to drink from the creek lying prone on the ground her face halfburied in the water and this not because she was thirsty but because it was a new way to drink
she imagined herself a belated traveller a poor girl an outcast quenching her thirst at the wayside brook her little packet of cresses doing duty for a bundle of clothes
night was coming on
perhaps it would storm
she had nowhere to go
she would apply at a hut for shelter
abruptly the temptation to dabble her feet in the creek presented itself to her
always she had liked to play in the water
what a delight now to take off her shoes and stockings and wade out into the shallows near the bank
she had worn low shoes that afternoon and the dust of the trail had filtered in above the edges
at times she felt the grit and grey sand on the soles of her feet and the sensation had set her teeth on edge
what a delicious alternative the cold clean water suggested and how easy it would be to do as she pleased just then if only she were a little girl
in the end it was stupid to be grown up
sitting upon the bank one finger tucked into the heel of her shoe hilma hesitated
suppose a train should come
she fancied she could see the engineer leaning from the cab with a great grin on his face or the brakeman shouting gibes at her from the platform
abruptly she blushed scarlet
the blood throbbed in her temples
her heart beat
since the famous evening of the barn dance annixter had spoken to her but twice
hilma no longer looked after the ranch house these days
the thought of setting foot within diningroom and bedroom terrified her and in the end her mother had taken over that part of her work
of the two meetings with the master of quien sabe one had been a mere exchange of good mornings as the two happened to meet over by the artesian well the other more complicated had occurred in the dairyhouse again annixter pretending to look over the new cheese press asking about details of her work
when this had happened on that previous occasion ending with attempt to kiss her hilma had been talkative enough chattering on from one subject to another never at a loss for a theme
but this last time was a veritable ordeal
no sooner had annixter appeared than her heart leaped and quivered like that of the houndharried doe
her speech failed her
throughout the whole brief interview she had been miserably tonguetied stammering monosyllables confused horribly awkward and when annixter had gone away she had fled to her little room and bolting the door had flung herself face downward on the bed and wept as though her heart were breaking she did not know why
that annixter had been overwhelmed with business all through the winter was an inexpressible relief to hilma
his affairs took him away from the ranch continually
he was absent sometimes for weeks making trips to san francisco or to sacramento or to bonneville
perhaps he was forgetting her overlooking her and while at first she told herself that she asked nothing better the idea of it began to occupy her mind
she began to wonder if it was really so
she knew his trouble
everybody did
the news of the sudden forward movement of the forces inaugurating the campaign had flared whitehot and blazing all over the country side
to notion attitude was heroic beyond all expression
his courage in facing the railroad as he had faced delaney in the barn seemed to her the pitch of sublimity
she refused to see any auxiliaries aiding him in his fight
to her imagination the great league which all the ranchers were joining was a mere form
annixter fronted the monster
but for him the corporation would gobble quien sabe as a whale would a minnow
he was a hero who stood between them all and destruction
he was a protector of her family
he was her champion
she began to mention him in her prayers every night adding a further petition to the effect that he would become a good man and that he should not swear so much and that he should never meet delaney again
however as hilma still debated the idea of bathing her feet in the creek a train did actually thunder past regular evening through express that never stopped between bakersfield and fresno
it stormed by with a deafening clamour and a swirl of smoke in a long succession of waycoaches and chocolate coloured pullmans grimy with the dust of the great deserts of the southwest
the quivering of the trestles supports set a tremble in the ground underfoot
the thunder of wheels drowned all sound of the flowing of the creek and also the noise of the buckskin mares hoofs descending from the trail upon the gravel about the creek so that hilma turning about after the passage of the train saw annixter close at hand with the abruptness of a vision
he was looking at her smiling as he rarely did the firm line of his outthrust lower lip relaxed goodhumouredly
he had taken off his campaign hat to her and though his stiff yellow hair was twisted into a bristling mop the little persistent tuft on the crown usually defiantly erect as an scalplock was nowhere in sight
hello its you is it miss hilma he exclaimed getting down from the buckskin and allowing her to drink
hilma nodded scrambling to her feet dusting her skirt with nervous pats of both hands
annixter sat down on a great rock close by and the loop of the bridle over his arm lit a cigar and began to talk
he complained of the heat of the day the bad condition of the lower road over which he had come on his way from a committee meeting of the league at los muertos of the slowness of the work on the irrigating ditch and as a matter of course of the general hard times
miss hilma he said abruptly never you marry a ranchman never out of trouble
hilma gasped her eyes widening till the full round of the pupil was disclosed
instantly a certain inexplicable guiltiness overpowered her with incredible confusion
her hands trembled as she pressed the bundle of cresses into a hard ball between her palms
annixter continued to talk
he was disturbed and excited himself at this unexpected meeting
never through all the past winter months of strenuous activity the fever of political campaigns the harrowing delays and ultimate defeat in one law court after another had he forgotten the look in face as he stood with one arm around her on the floor of his barn in peril of his life from the busters revolver
that dumb confession of wideopen eyes had been enough for him
yet somehow he never had had a chance to act upon it
during the short period when he could be on his ranch hilma had always managed to avoid him
once even she had spent a month about christmas time with her mothers father who kept a hotel in san francisco
now today however he had her all to himself
he would put an end to the situation that troubled him and vexed him day after day month after month
beyond question the moment had come for something definite he could not say precisely what
readjusting his cigar between his teeth he resumed his speech
it suited his humour to take the girl into his confidence following an instinct which warned him that this would bring about a certain closeness of their relations a certain intimacy
what do you think of this row anyways miss railroad fuss in general
think shelgrim and his rushers are going to jump quien going to run us off the ranch
oh no sir protested hilma still breathless
oh no indeed not
well what then
hilma made a little uncertain movement of ignorance donot know what
well the league agreed today that if the test cases were lost in the supreme know weve appealed to the supreme court at fight
fight
yes fight
fight you and mr delaney that time withoh guns donot know grumbled annixter vaguely
what do think lowpitched almost husky voice trembled a little as she replied so terrible
oh those revolvers in the barn
i can hear them yet
every shot seemed like the explosion of tons of powder
shall we clear out then
shall we let delaney have possession and behrman and all that lot
shall we give in to them
never never she exclaimed her great eyes flashing wouldnot like to be turned out of your home would you miss hilma because quien sabe is your home isnot it lived here ever since you were as big as a minute
you wouldnot like to have behrman and the rest of em turn you out she murmured
no i shouldnot like that mamma and well do you think for one second going to let em cried annixter his teeth tightening on his cigar
you stay right where you are take care of you right enough
look here he demanded abruptly no use for that roaring lush delaney have you think he is a wicked man she declared know the railroad has pretended to sell him part of the ranch and he lets mr behrman and mr ruggles just use him
right
i thought you wouldnot be keen on him
there was a long pause
the buckskin began blowing among the pebbles nosing for grass and annixter shifted his cigar to the other corner of his mouth
pretty place he muttered looking around him
then he added miss hilma see here i want to have a kind of talk with you if you donot mind
i donot know just how to say these sort of things and if i get all balled up as i go along you just set it down to the fact that never had any experience in dealing with feemale girls understand
you see ever since the barn danceyes and long before been thinking a lot about you
straight i have and i guess you know it about the only girl that i ever knew well and i guess he declared deliberately about the only one i want to know my nature
you didnot say anything that time when we stood there together and delaney was playing the fool but somehow i got the idea that you didnot want delaney to do for me one little bit that if hed got me then you would have been sorrier than if hed got any one else
well i felt just that way about you
i would rather have had him shoot any other girl in the room than you yes or in the whole state
why if anything should happen to you miss i wouldnot care to go on with anything
behrman could jump quien sabe and welcome
and delaney could shoot me full of holes whenever he got good and ready quit lay right down
i wouldnot care a whoop about anything any more
you are the only girl for me in the whole world
i didnot think so at first
i didnot want to
but seeing you around every day and seeing how pretty you were and how clever and hearing your voice and all why it just got all inside of me somehow and now i canot think of anything else
i hate to go to san francisco or sacramento or visalia or even bonneville for only a day just because you arenot there in any of those places and i just rush what got to do so as i can get back here
while you were away that christmas time why i was as lonesome asoh you donot know anything about it
i just scratched off the days on the calendar every night one by one till you got back
and it just comes to this i want you with me all the time
i want you should have a home thats my home too
i want to take care of you and have you all for myself you understand
what do you say
hilma standing up before him retied a knot in her handkerchief bundle with elaborate precaution blinking at it through her tears
what do you say miss hilma
annixter repeated
how about that
what do you say
just above a whisper hilma murmured donot know know what you think we could hit it off together donot know know we could hilma
i donot mean to scare you
what are you crying for donot know
annixter got up cast away his cigar and dropping the buckskins bridle came and stood beside her putting a hand on her shoulder
hilma did not move and he felt her trembling
she still plucked at the knot of the handkerchief canot do without you little girl annixter continued and i want you
i want you bad
i donot get much fun out of life ever
it sure isnot my nature i guess a hard man
everybody is trying to down me and now up against the railroad fighting em all hilma night and day lock stock and barrel and fighting now for my home my land everything i have in the world
if i win out i want somebody to be glad with me
if i want somebody to be sorry for me sorry with that somebody is you
i am dogtired of going it alone
i want some one to back me up
i want to feel you alongside of me to give me a touch of the shoulder now and then tired of fighting for property money
i want to fight for some beside myself
understand want to feel that it isnot all there are other interests than mine in the theres some one dependent on me and thats thinking of me as thinking of one i can come home to at night and put my arm this and have her put her two arms around melike he paused a second and once again as it had been in that moment of imminent peril when he stood with his arm around her their eyes her two arms around me prompted annixter half smiling what hilma donot know
like what hilma he insisted this she questioned
with a movement of infinite tenderness and affection she slid her arms around his neck still crying a little
the sensation of her warm body in his embrace the feeling of her smooth round arm through the thinness of her sleeve pressing against his cheek thrilled annixter with a delight such as he had never known
he bent his head and kissed her upon the nape of her neck where the delicate amber tint melted into the thick sweet smelling mass of her dark brown hair
she shivered a little holding him closer ashamed as yet to look up
without speech they stood there for a long minute holding each other close
then hilma pulled away from him mopping her tearstained cheeks with the little moist ball of her handkerchief
what do you say
is it a go demanded annixter jovially thought i hated you all the time she said and the velvety huskiness of her voice never sounded so sweet to him
and i thought it was that crockery smashing goat of a lout of a cowpuncher
delaney
the idea
oh dear
i think it must always have been you
since when hilma he asked putting his arm around her
ah but it is good to have you my girl he exclaimed delighted beyond words that she permitted this freedom
since when
tell us all about it
oh since always
it was ever so long before i came to think of youto well to think mean to rememberoh you know what i mean
but when i did oh then what donot havenot way long enough to know
but you said you thought it must have been me always know but that was differentoh all mixed up so nervous and trembly now
oh she cried suddenly her face overcast with a look of earnestness and great seriousness both her hands catching at his wrist oh you be good to me now wonot you only a little little child in so many ways and given myself to you all in a minute and i canot go back of it now and its for always
i donot know how it happened or why
sometimes i think i didnot wish it but now its done and i am glad and happy
but if you werenot good to meoh think of how it would be with me
you are strong and big and rich and i am only a servant of yours a little nobody but given all i had to you must be so good to me now
always remember that
be good to me and be gentle and kind to me in everything or you will break my heart
annixter took her in his arms
he was speechless
no words that he had at his command seemed adequate
all he could say was all right little girl you be frightened take care of you all right thats all right
for a long time they sat there under the shade of the great trestle their arms about each other speaking only at intervals
an hour passed
the buckskin finding no feed to her taste took the trail stablewards the bridle dragging
annixter let her go
rather than to take his arm from around waist he would have lost his whole stable
at last however he bestirred himself and began to talk
he thought it time to formulate some plan of action
well now hilma what are we going to do
do she repeated
why must we do anything
oh isnot this enough better ahead he went on want to fix you up somewhere where you can have a bit of a home all to yourself see bonneville wouldnot do always a lot of yaps about there that know us and they would begin to cackle first off
how about san francisco
we might go up next week and have a look around
i would find rooms you could take somewheres and we would fix em up as lovely as howdoyoudo
oh but why go away from quien sabe she protested
and then so soon too
why must we have a wedding trip now that you are so busy it be betteroh i tell you we could go to monterey after we were married for a little week where mammas people live and then come back here to the ranch house and settle right down where we are and let me keep house for you
i wouldnot even want a single servant
annixter heard and his face grew troubled
hum he said see
he gathered up a handful of pebbles and began snapping them carefully into the creek
he fell thoughtful
here was a phase of the affair he had not planned in the least
he had supposed all the time that hilma took his meaning
his old suspicion that she was trying to get a hold on him stirred again for a moment
there was no good of such talk as that
always these feemale girls seemed crazy to get married bent on complicating the situation that best said hilma glancing at him donot know he muttered gloomily
well then lets not come right back to quien sabe without going to monterey
anything that you want i want hadnot thought of it in just that way he observed
in what way then we wait about this marrying business just it she said gayly said it was too soon
there would be so much to do between whiles
why not say at the end of the summer
say what
our marriage i mean
why get married then the good of all that fuss about it
i donot go anything upon a minister puddling round in my affairs the difference anyhow
we understand each other that enough
pshaw hilma no marrying man
she looked at him a moment bewildered then slowly she took his meaning
she rose to her feet her eyes wide her face paling with terror
he did not look at her but he could hear the catch in her throat
oh she exclaimed with a long deep breath and again oh the back of her hand against her lips
it was a quick gasp of a veritable physical anguish
her eyes brimmed over
annixter rose looking at her
well he said awkwardly well
hilma leaped back from him with an instinctive recoil of her whole being throwing out her hands in a gesture of defence fearing she knew not what
there was as yet no sense of insult in her mind no outraged modesty
she was only terrified
it was as though searching for wild flowers she had come suddenly upon a snake
she stood for an instant spellbound her eyes wide her bosom swelling then all at once turned and fled darting across the plank that served for a foot bridge over the creek gaining the opposite bank and disappearing with a brisk rustle of underbrush such as might have been made by the flight of a frightened fawn
abruptly annixter found himself alone
for a moment he did not move then he picked up his campaign hat carefully creased its limp crown and put it on his head and stood for a moment looking vaguely at the ground on both sides of him
he went away without uttering a word without change of countenance his hands in his pockets his feet taking great strides along the trail in the direction of the ranch house
he had no sight of hilma again that evening and the next morning he was up early and did not breakfast at the ranch house
business of the league called him to bonneville to confer with magnus and the firm of lawyers retained by the league to fight the landgrabbing cases
an appeal was to be taken to the supreme court at washington and it was to be settled that day which of the cases involved should be considered as test cases
instead of driving or riding into bonneville as he usually did annixter took an early morning train the bakersfieldfresno local at guadalajara and went to bonneville by rail arriving there at twenty minutes after seven and breakfasting by appointment with magnus derrick and osterman at the yosemite house on main street
the conference of the committee with the lawyers took place in a front room of the yosemite one of the latter bringing with him his clerk who made a stenographic report of the proceedings and took carbon copies of all letters written
the conference was long and complicated the business transacted of the utmost moment and it was not until two oclock that annixter found himself at liberty
however as he and magnus descended into the lobby of the hotel they were aware of an excited and interested group collected about the swing doors that opened from the lobby of the yosemite into the bar of the same name
dyke was at a distance they could hear the reverberation of his deeptoned voice uplifted in wrath and furious expostulation
magnus and annixter joined the group wondering and all at once fell full upon the first scene of a drama
that same morning mother had awakened him according to his instructions at daybreak
a consignment of his hop poles from the north had arrived at the freight office of the and in bonneville and he was to drive in on his farm wagon and bring them out
he would have a busy day
hello hello he said as his mother pulled his ear to arouse him morning mamma time she said after five already
your breakfast is on the stove
he took her hand and kissed it with great affection
he loved his mother devotedly quite as much as he did the little tad
in their little cottage in the forest of green hops that surrounded them on every hand the three led a joyous and secluded life contented industrious happy asking nothing better
dyke himself was a bighearted jovial man who spread an atmosphere of goodhumour wherever he went
in the evenings he played with sidney like a big boy an older brother lying on the bed or the sofa taking her in his arms
between them they had invented a great game
the exengineer his boots removed his huge legs in the air hoisted the little tad on the soles of his stockinged feet like a circus acrobat dandling her there pretending he was about to let her fall
sidney choking with delight held on nervously with little screams and chirps of excitement while he shifted her gingerly from one foot to another and thence the final act the great gallery play to the palm of one great hand
at this point mrs dyke was called in both father and daughter children both crying out that she was to come in and look look
she arrived out of breath from the kitchen the potato masher in her hand
such children she murmured shaking her head at them amused for all that tucking the potato masher under her arm and clapping her hands
in the end it was part of the game that sidney should tumble down upon dyke whereat he invariably vented a great bellow as if in pain declaring that his ribs were broken
gasping his eyes shut he pretended to be in the extreme of he was dying
sidney always a little uncertain amused but distressed shook him nervously tugging at his beard pushing open his eyelid with one finger imploring him not to frighten her to wake up and be good
on this occasion while yet he was halfdressed dyke tiptoed into his mothers room to look at sidney fast asleep in her little iron cot her arm under her head her lips parted
with infinite precaution he kissed her twice and then finding one little stocking hung with its mate very neatly over the back of a chair dropped into it a dime rolled up in a wad of paper
he winked all to himself and went out again closing the door with exaggerated carefulness
he breakfasted alone mrs dyke pouring his coffee and handing him his plate of ham and eggs and half an hour later took himself off in his springless skeleton wagon humming a tune behind his beard and cracking the whip over the backs of his staid and solid farm horses
the morning was fine the sun just coming up
he left guadalajara sleeping and lifeless on his left and going across lots over an angle of quien sabe came out upon the upper road a mile below the long trestle
he was in great spirits looking about him over the brown fields ruddy with the dawn
almost directly in front of him but far off the gilded dome of the courthouse at bonneville was glinting radiant in the first rays of the sun while a few miles distant toward the north the venerable campanile of the mission san juan stood silhouetted in purplish black against the flaming east
as he proceeded the great farm horses jogging forward placid deliberate the country side waked to another day
crossing the irrigating ditch further on he met a gang of portuguese with picks and shovels over their shoulders just going to work
hooven already abroad shouted him a goot mornun from behind the fence of los muertos
far off toward the southwest in the bare expanse of the open fields where a clump of eucalyptus and cypress trees set a dark green note a thin stream of smoke rose straight into the air from the kitchen of ranch houses
but a mile or so beyond the long trestle he was surprised to see magnus protege the onetime shepherd vanamee coming across quien sabe by a trail from one of division houses
without knowing exactly why dyke received the impression that the young man had not been in bed all of that night
as the two approached each other dyke eyed the young fellow
he was distrustful of vanamee having the countrybred suspicion of any person he could not understand
vanamee was beyond doubt no part of the life of ranch and country town
he was an alien a vagabond a strange fellow who came and went in mysterious fashion making no friends keeping to himself
why did he never wear a hat why indulge in a fine black pointed beard when either a round beard or a mustache was the invariable custom
why did he not cut his hair
above all why did he prowl about so much at night
as the two passed each other dyke for all his goodnature was a little blunt in his greeting and looked back at the exshepherd over his shoulder
dyke was right in his suspicion bed had not been disturbed for three nights
on the monday of that week he had passed the entire night in the garden of the mission overlooking the seed ranch in the little valley
tuesday evening had found him miles away from that spot in a deep arroyo in the sierra foothills to the eastward while wednesday he had slept in an abandoned dobe on stock range twenty miles from his resting place of the night before
the fact of the matter was that the old restlessness had once more seized upon vanamee
something began tugging at him the spur of some unseen rider touched his flank
the instinct of the wanderer woke and moved
for some time now he had been a part of the los muertos staff
on quien sabe as on the other ranches the slack season was at hand
while waiting for the wheat to come up no one was doing much of anything
vanamee had come over to los muertos and spent most of his days on horseback riding the range rounding up and watching the cattle in the fourth division of the ranch
but if the vagabond instinct now roused itself in the strange fellows nature a counter influence had also set in
more and more vanamee frequented the mission garden after nightfall sometimes remaining there till the dawn began to whiten lying prone on the ground his chin on his folded arms his eyes searching the darkness over the little valley of the seed ranch watching watching
as the days went by he became more reticent than ever
presley often came to find him on the stock range a lonely figure in the great wilderness of bare green hillsides but vanamee no longer took him into his confidence
father sarria alone heard his strange stories
dyke drove on toward bonneville thinking over the whole matter
he knew as every one did in that part of the country the legend of vanamee and angele the romance of the mission garden the mystery of the other flight to the deserts of the southwest his periodic returns his strange reticent solitary character but like many another of the country people he accounted for vanamee by a short and easy method
no doubt the fellows wits were turned
that was the long and short of it
the exengineer reached the post office in bonneville towards eleven oclock but he did not at once present his notice of the arrival of his consignment at office
it entertained him to indulge in an hours lounging about the streets
it was seldom he got into town and when he did he permitted himself the luxury of enjoying his evident popularity
he met friends everywhere in the post office in the drug store in the barber shop and around the courthouse
with each one he held a moments conversation almost invariably this ended in the same way come on n have a drink
well i donot care if i do
and the friends proceeded to the yosemite bar pledging each other with punctilious ceremony
dyke however was a strictly temperate man
his life on the engine had trained him well
alcohol he never touched drinking instead ginger ale drinks
at the drug store which also kept a stock of miscellaneous stationery his eye was caught by a transparent slate a childs toy where upon a little pane of frosted glass one could trace with considerable elaboration outline figures of cows ploughs bunches of fruit and even rural water mills that were printed on slips of paper underneath
now theres an idea jim he observed to the boy behind the sodawater fountain know a little tad that would just about jump out of her skin for that
think have to take it with me
sidney getting along the other asked while wrapping up the package enthusiasm had made of his little girl a celebrity throughout bonneville
the exengineer promptly became voluble assertive doggedly emphatic
smartest little tad in all tulare county and more fun
a regular whole show in herself
and the hops inquired the other
bully declared dyke with the goodnatured mans readiness to talk of his private affairs to any one who would listen
bully dead sure of a bonanza crop by now
the rain came right
i actually donot know as i can store the crop in those barns i built its going to be so big
that foreman of mine was a daisy
jim going to make money in that deal
after paid off the know i had to mortgage yes crop and homestead both but i can pay it off and all the interest to boot lovelywell and as i was saying after all expenses are paid off clear big money m son
yes sir
i there was boodle in hops
you know the crop is contracted for already
sure the foreman managed that a daisy
chap in san francisco will take it all and at the advanced price
i wanted to hang on to see if it wouldnot go to six cents but the foreman said no thats good enough
so i signed it bully hey
then whatll you do
well i donot know have a layoff for a month or so and take the little tad and mother up and show em the its time for the schools to open and then well put sid in the seminary at marysville
catch on suppose youll stay right by hops now
right you are mson
i know a good thing when i see it plenty others going into hops next season
i set em the example be surprised if it came to be a regular industry hereabouts planning ahead for next year already
i can let the foreman go now that learned the game myself and i think buy a piece of land off quien sabe and get a bigger crop and build a couple more barns and by george in about five years time have things humming going to make jim
he emerged once more into the street and went up the block leisurely planting his feet squarely
he fancied that he could feel he was considered of more importance nowadays
he was no longer a subordinate an employee
he was his own man a proprietor an owner of land furthering a successful enterprise
no one had helped him he had followed no ones lead
he had struck out unaided for himself and his success was due solely to his own intelligence industry and foresight
he squared his great shoulders till the blue gingham of his jumper all but cracked
of late his great blond beard had grown and the work in the sun had made his face very red
under the visor of his of his engineering blue eyes twinkled with vast goodnature
he felt that he made a fine figure as he went by a group of young girls in lawns and muslins and garden hats on their way to the post office
he wondered if they looked after him wondered if they had heard that he was in a fair way to become a rich man
but the chronometer in the window of the jewelry store warned him that time was passing
he turned about and crossing the street took his way to office which was the freight as well as the land office of the and railroad
as he stood for a moment at the counter in front of the wire partition waiting for the clerk to make out the order for the freight agent at the depot dyke was surprised to see a familiar figure in conference with ruggles himself by a desk inside the railing
the figure was that of a middleaged man fat with a great stomach which he stroked from time to time
as he turned about addressing a remark to the clerk dyke recognised behrman
the banker railroad agent and political manipulator seemed to the eyes to be more gross than ever
his smoothshaven jowl stood out big and tremulous on either side of his face the roll of fat on the nape of his neck sprinkled with sparse stiff hairs bulged out with greater prominence
his great stomach covered with a light brown linen vest stamped with innumerable interlocked horseshoes protruded far in advance enormous aggressive
he wore his inevitable roundtopped hat of stiff brown straw varnished so bright that it reflected the light of the office windows like a helmet and even from where he stood dyke could hear his loud breathing and the clink of the hollow links of his watch chain upon the vest buttons of imitation pearl as his stomach rose and fell
dyke looked at him with attention
there was the enemy the representative of the trust with which league was locking horns
the great struggle had begun to invest the combatants with interest
daily almost hourly dyke was in touch with the ranchers the wheatgrowers
he heard their denunciations their growls of exasperation and defiance
here was the other placid fat man with a stiff straw hat and linen vest who never lost his temper who smiled affably upon his enemies giving them good advice commiserating with them in one defeat after another never ruffled never excited sure of his power conscious that back of him was the machine the colossal force the inexhaustible coffers of a mighty organisation vomiting millions to the thousands
the league was clamorous ubiquitous its objects known to every urchin on the streets but the trust was silent its ways inscrutable the public saw only results
it worked on in the dark calm disciplined irresistible
abruptly dyke received the impression of the multitudinous ramifications of the colossus
under his feet the ground seemed mined down there below him in the dark the huge tentacles went silently twisting and advancing spreading out in every direction sapping the strength of all opposition quiet gradual biding the time to reach up and out and grip with a sudden unleashing of gigantic strength be wanting some cars of you people before the summer is out observed dyke to the clerk as he folded up and put away the order that the other had handed him
he remembered perfectly well that he had arranged the matter of transporting his crop some months before but his role of proprietor amused him and he liked to busy himself again and again with the details of his undertaking suppose he added be able to give em to me be a big wheat crop to move this year and i donot want to be caught in any car famine
oh youll get your cars murmured the other be the means of bringing business your way dyke went on done so well with my hops that there are a lot of others going into the business next season
suppose he continued struck with an idea suppose we went into some sort of pool a sort of shippers organisation could you give us special rates cheaper a cent and a half
the other looked up cent and a half
say cents and a half and maybe talk business with you
four cents and a half returned dyke donot see it
why the regular rate is only two cents
no it isnot answered the clerk looking him gravely in the eye five cents
well theres where you are wrong mson dyke retorted genially
you look it up find the freight on hops from bonneville to frisco is two cents a pound for car load lots
you told me that yourself last fall
that was last fall observed the clerk
there was a silence
dyke shot a glance of suspicion at the other
then reassured he remarked you look it up see right
behrman came forward and shook hands politely with the exengineer
anything i can do for you mr dyke
dyke explained
when he had done speaking the clerk turned to behrman and observed respectfully our regular rate on hops is five cents
yes answered behrman pausing to reflect yes mr dyke thats cents
the clerk brought forward a folder of yellow paper and handed it to dyke
it was inscribed at the top tariff schedule no and underneath these words in brackets was a smaller inscription see for yourself said behrman
he indicated an item under the head of miscellany
the following rates for carriage of hops in car load lots read dyke take effect june and will remain in force until superseded by a later tariff
those quoted beyond stockton are subject to changes in traffic arrangements with carriers by water from that point
in the list that was printed below dyke saw that the rate for hops between bonneville or guadalajara and san francisco was five cents
for a moment dyke was confused
then swiftly the matter became clear in his mind
the railroad had raised the freight on hops from two cents to five
all his calculations as to a profit on his little investment he had based on a freight rate of two cents a pound
he was under contract to deliver his crop
he could not draw back
the new rate ate up every cent of his gains
he stood there ruined
why what do you mean he burst out
you promised me a rate of two cents and i went ahead with my business with that understanding
what do you mean
behrman and the clerk watched him from the other side of the counter
the rate is five cents declared the clerk doggedly
well that ruins me shouted dyke
do you understand
i wonot make fifty cents
why i will ruins me do you understand
the other raised a shoulder
we donot force you to ship
you can do as you like
the rate is five cents you under contract to deliver
what am i going to do
why you told promised me a twocent rate donot remember it said the clerk donot know anything about that
but i know this i know that hops have gone up
i know the german crop was a failure and that the crop in new york wasnot worth the hauling
hops have gone up to nearly a dollar
you donot suppose we donot know that do you mr dyke the price of hops got to do with you got to do with us returned the other with a sudden aggressiveness that the freight rate has gone up to meet the price not doing business for our health
my orders are to raise your rate to five cents and i think you are getting off easy
dyke stared in blank astonishment
for the moment the audacity of the affair was what most appealed to him
he forgot its personal application
good lord he murmured good lord
what will you people do next
look here your basis of applying freight rates anyhow he suddenly vociferated with furious sarcasm your rule
what are you guided by
but at the words behrman who had kept silent during the heat of the discussion leaned abruptly forward
for the only time in his knowledge dyke saw his face inflamed with anger and with the enmity and contempt of all this farming element with whom he was contending
yes whats your rule your basis demanded dyke turning swiftly to him
behrman emphasised each word of his reply with a tap of one forefinger on the counter before him the exengineer stepped back a pace his fingers on the ledge of the counter to steady himself
he felt himself grow pale his heart became a mere leaden weight in his chest inert refusing to beat
in a second the whole affair in all its bearings went speeding before the eye of his imagination like the rapid unrolling of a panorama
every cent of his earnings was sunk in this hop business of his
more than that he had borrowed money to carry it on certain of of behrman offering his crop and his little home as security
once he failed to meet his obligations behrman would foreclose
not only would the railroad devour every morsel of his profits but also it would take from him his home at a blow he would be left penniless and without a home
what would then become of his what would become of the little tad
she whom he had been planning to educate like a veritable lady
for all that year he had talked of his ambition for his little daughter to every one he met
all bonneville knew of it
what a mark for gibes he had made of himself
the workingman turned farmer
what a target for who had fancied he could elude the railroad
he remembered he had once said the great trust had overlooked his little enterprise disdaining to plunder such small fry
he should have known better than that
how had he ever imagined the road would permit him to make any money
anger was not in him yet no rousing of the blind whitehot wrath that leaps to the attack with prehensile fingers moved him
the blow merely crushed staggered confused
he stepped aside to give place to a coatless man in a pink shirt who entered carrying in his hands an automatic doorclosing apparatus
where does this go inquired the man
dyke sat down for a moment on a seat that had been removed from a wornout railway car to do duty in office
on the back of a yellow envelope he made some vague figures with a stump of blue pencil multiplying subtracting perplexing himself with many errors
behrman the clerk and the man with the doorclosing apparatus involved themselves in a long argument gazing intently at the top panel of the door
the man who had come to fix the apparatus was unwilling to guarantee it unless a sign was put on the outside of the door warning incomers that the door was selfclosing
this sign would cost fifteen cents extra
but you didnot say anything about this when the thing was ordered declared behrman
no i wonot pay it my friend an overcharge
you neednot think observed the clerk that just because you are dealing with the railroad you are going to work us
genslinger came in accompanied by delaney
behrman and the clerk abruptly dismissing the man with the doorclosing machine put themselves behind the counter and engaged in conversation with these two
genslinger introduced delaney
the buster had a string of horses he was shipping southward
no doubt he had come to make arrangements with the railroad in the matter of stock cars
the conference of the four men was amicable in the extreme
dyke studying the figures on the back of the envelope came forward again
absorbed only in his own distress he ignored the editor and the cowpuncher
say he hazarded how about this
i make told you what our rates are mr dyke exclaimed the clerk angrily all the arrangement we will make
take it or leave it
he turned again to genslinger giving the exengineer his back
dyke moved away and stood for a moment in the centre of the room staring at the figures on the envelope donot see he muttered just what going to do
no i donot see what going to do at all
ruggles came in bringing with him two other men in whom dyke recognised dummy buyers of the los muertos and osterman ranchos
they brushed by him jostling his elbow and as he went out of the door he heard them exchange jovial greetings with delaney genslinger and behrman
dyke went down the stairs to the street and proceeded onward aimlessly in the direction of the yosemite house fingering the yellow envelope and looking vacantly at the sidewalk
there was a stoop to his massive shoulders
his great arms dangled loosely at his sides the palms of his hands open
as he went along a certain feeling of shame touched him
surely his predicament must be apparent to every passerby
no doubt every one recognised the unsuccessful man in the very way he slouched along
the young girls in lawns muslins and garden hats returning from the post office their hands full of letters must surely see in him the type of the failure the bankrupt
then brusquely his tardy rage flamed up
by god it was not his fault he had made no mistake
his energy industry and foresight had been sound
he had been merely the object of a colossal trick a sordid injustice a victim of the insatiate greed of the monster caught and choked by one of those millions of tentacles suddenly reaching up from below from out the dark beneath his feet coiling around his throat throttling him strangling him sucking his blood
for a moment he thought of the courts but instantly laughed at the idea
what court was immune from the power of the monster
ah the rage of helplessness the fury of impotence
no help no in a brief a veritable giant built of great sinews powerful in the full tide of his manhood having all his health all his wits
how could he now face his home
how could he tell his mother of this catastrophe
and little tad how could he explain to her this soften her disappointment
how keep the tears from out her keep alive her confidence in faith in his resources
bitter fierce ominous his wrath loomed up in his heart
his fists gripped tight together his teeth clenched
oh for a moment to have his hand upon the throat of behrman wringing the breath from him wrenching out the red life of the street with the blood sucked from the veins of the people
to the first friend that he met dyke told the tale of the tragedy and to the next and to the next
the affair went from mouth to mouth spreading with electrical swiftness overpassing and running ahead of dyke himself so that by the time he reached the lobby of the yosemite house he found his story awaiting him
a group formed about him
in his immediate vicinity business for the instant was suspended
the group swelled
one after another of his friends added themselves to it
magnus derrick joined it and annixter
again and again dyke recounted the matter beginning with the time when he was discharged from the same corporations service for refusing to accept an unfair wage
his voice quivered with exasperation his heavy frame shook with rage his eyes were injected bloodshot his face flamed vermilion while his deep bass rumbled throughout the running comments of his auditors like the thunderous reverberation of diapason
from all points of view the story was discussed by those who listened to him now in the heat of excitement now calmly judicially
one verdict however prevailed
it was voiced by annixter stuck
you can roar till youre black in the face but you canot buck against the railroad nothing to be done
you can shoot the ruffian you can shoot behrman clamoured one of the group
yes sir by the lord you can shoot him
poor fool commented annixter turning away
nothing to be done
no there was nothing to be one thing
dyke at last alone and driving his team out of the town turned the business confusedly over in his mind from end to end
advice suggestion even offers of financial aid had been showered upon him from all directions
friends were not wanting who heatedly presented to his consideration all manner of ingenious plans wonderful devices
they were worthless
the tentacle held fast
he was stuck
by degrees as his wagon carried him farther out into the country and open empty fields his anger lapsed and the numbness of bewilderment returned
he could not look one hour ahead into the future could formulate no plans even for the next day
he did not know what to do
he was stuck
with the limpness and inertia of a sack of sand the reins slipping loosely in his dangling fingers his eyes fixed staring between the horses heads he allowed himself to be carried aimlessly along
he resigned himself
what did he care
what was the use of going on
he was stuck
the team he was driving had once belonged to the los muertos stables and unguided as the horses were they took the county road towards ranch house
dyke all abroad was unaware of the fact till drawn by the smell of water the horses halted by the trough in front of saloon
the exengineer dismounted looking about him realising where he was
so much the worse it did not matter
now that he had come so far it was as short to go home by this route as to return on his tracks
slowly he unchecked the horses and stood at their heads watching them drink donot see he muttered just what i am going to do
caraher appeared at the door of his place his red face red beard and flaming cravat standing sharply out from the shadow of the doorway
he called a welcome to dyke
hello captain
dyke looked up nodding his head listlessly
hello caraher he answered
well continued the saloonkeeper coming forward a step the news in town
dyke told him red face suddenly took on a darker colour
the red glint in his eyes shot from under his eyebrows
furious he vented a rolling explosion of oaths
and now its your turn he vociferated
they ainot after only the big wheatgrowers the rich men
by god theyll even pick the poor mans pocket
oh theyll get their bellies full some day
it canot last forever wake up the wrong kind of man some morning the man thats got guts in him that will hit back when hes kicked and that will talk to em with a torch in one hand and a stick of dynamite in the other
he raised his clenched fists in the air
so help me god he cried when i think it all over i go crazy i see red
oh if the people only knew their strength
oh if i could wake em up not only shelgrim but theres others
all the magnates all the butchers all the bloodsuckers by the thousands
their day will come by god it will
by now the exengineer and the barkeeper had retired to the saloon back of the grocery to talk over the details of this new outrage
dyke still a little dazed sat down by one of the tables preoccupied saying but little and caraher as a matter of course set the whiskey bottle at his elbow
it happened that at this same moment presley returning to los muertos from bonneville his pockets full of mail stopped in at the grocery to buy some black lead for his bicycle
in the saloon on the other side of the narrow partition he overheard the conversation between dyke and caraher
the door was open
he caught every word distinctly
tell us all about it dyke urged caraher
for the fiftieth time dyke told the story
already it had crystallised into a certain form
he used the same phrases with each repetition the same sentences the same words
in his mind it became set
thus he would tell it to any one who would listen from now on week after week year after year all the rest of his i based my calculations on a twocent rate
so soon as they saw i was to make money they doubled the the traffic would i mortgaged to me with a turn of the handstuck cinched and not one thing to be done
as he talked he drank glass after glass of whiskey and the honest rage the open aboveboard fury of his mind coagulated thickened and sunk to a dull evil hatred a wicked oblique malevolence
caraher sure now of winning a disciple replenished his glass
do you blame us now he cried us others the reds
ah yes its all very well for your middle class to preach moderation
i could do it too
you could do it too if your belly was fed if your property was safe if your wife had not been murdered if your children were not starving
easy enough then to preach lawabiding methods legal redress and all such rot
but how about he vociferated
ah yes a loudmouthed rumseller ainot a wildeyed striker ainot a bloodthirsty anarchist ainot wait till youve seen your wife brought home to you with the face you used to kiss smashed in by a horses by the trust as it happened to me
then talk about moderation
and you dyke blacklisted engineer discharged employee ruined agriculturist wait till you see your little tad and your mother turned out of doors when behrman forecloses
wait till you see em getting thin and white and till you hear your little girl ask you why you all donot eat a little more and that she wants her dinner and you canot give it to her
wait till you the same time that your family is dying for lack of hundred thousand acres of of bushels of and gobbled by the railroad trust and then talk of moderation
that talk is just what the trust wants to hear
it ainot frightened of that one thing only it does listen to one thing it is frightened people with dynamite in their inches of plugged gaspipe talks
dyke did not reply
he filled another pony of whiskey and drank it in two gulps
his frown had lowered to a scowl his face was a dark red his head had sunk bulllike between his massive shoulders without winking he gazed long and with troubled eyes at his knotted muscular hands lying open on the table before him idle their occupation gone
presley forgot his black lead
he listened to caraher
through the open door he caught a glimpse of back broad muscled bowed down the great shoulders stooping
the whole drama of the doubled freight rate leaped salient and distinct in the eye of his mind
and this was but one instance an isolated case
because he was near at hand he happened to see it
how many others were there the length and breadth of the state
constantly this sort of thing must industries choked out in their very beginnings the air full of the death rattles of little enterprises expiring unobserved in faroff counties up in canyons and arroyos of the foothills forgotten by every one but the monster who was daunted by the magnitude of no business however great who overlooked no opportunity of plunder however petty who with one tentacle grabbed a hundred thousand acres of wheat and with another pilfered a pocketful of growing hops
he went away without a word his head bent his hands clutched tightly on the cork grips of the handle bars of his bicycle
his lips were white
in his heart a blind demon of revolt raged tumultuous shrieking blasphemies
at los muertos presley overtook annixter
as he guided his wheel up the driveway to ranch house he saw the master of quien sabe and harran in conversation on the steps of the porch
magnus stood in the doorway talking to his wife
occupied with the press of business and involved in the final conference with the lawyers on the eve of the latters departure for washington annixter had missed the train that was to take him back to guadalajara and quien sabe
accordingly he had accepted the invitation to return with him on his buckboard to los muertos and before leaving bonneville had telephoned to his ranch to have young vacca bring the buckskin by way of the lower road to meet him at los muertos
he found her waiting there for him but before going on delayed a few moments to tell harran of affair wonder what he will do now observed harran when his first outburst of indignation had subsided
nothing declared annixter stuck
that eats up every cent of earnings harran went on
he has been ten years saving them
oh i told him to make sure of the railroad when he first spoke to me about growing hops just seen him said presley as he joined the others
he was at i only saw his back
he was drinking at a table and his back was towards me
but the man looked crushed
it is terrible terrible
he was at was he demanded annixter
yes
drinking hey think so
yes i saw a bottle
drinking at exclaimed annixter rancorously can see finish
there was a silence
it seemed as if nothing more was to be said
they paused looking thoughtfully on the ground
in silence grim bitter infinitely sad the three men as if at that moment actually standing in the barroom of roadside saloon contemplated the slow sinking the inevitable collapse and submerging of one of their companions the wreck of a career the ruin of an individual an honest man strong fearless upright struck down by a colossal power perverted by an evil influence go reeling to his ruin see his finish repeated annixter
exit dyke and score another tally for behrman shelgrim and co he moved away impatiently loosening the tierope with which the buckskin was fastened
he swung himself up
god for us all he declared as he rode away and the devil take the hindmost going home
i still have one a little longer
he galloped away along the lower road in the direction of quien sabe emerging from the grove of cypress and eucalyptus about the ranch house and coming out upon the bare brown plain of the wheat land stretching away from him in apparent barrenness on either hand
it was late in the day already his shadow was long upon the padded dust of the road in front of him
on ahead a long ways off and a little to the north the venerable campanile of the mission san juan was glinting radiant in the last rays of the sun while behind him towards the north and west the gilded dome of the courthouse at bonneville stood silhouetted in purplish black against the flaming west
annixter spurred the buckskin forward
he feared he might be late to his supper
he wondered if it would be brought to him by hilma
hilma
the name struck across in his brain with a pleasant glowing tremour
all through that day of activity of strenuous business the minute and cautious planning of the final campaign in the great war of the league and the trust the idea of her and the recollection of her had been the undercurrent of his thoughts
at last he was alone
he could put all other things behind him and occupy himself solely with her
in that glory of the days end in that chaos of sunshine he saw her again
unimaginative crude direct his fancy nevertheless placed her before him steeped in sunshine saturated with glorious light brilliant radiant alluring
he saw the sweet simplicity of her carriage the statuesque evenness of the contours of her figure the single deep swell of her bosom the solid masses of her hair
he remembered the small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintiness he had so often remarked about her her slim narrow feet the little steel buckles of her low shoes the knot of black ribbon she had begun to wear of late on the back of her head and he heard her voice lowpitched velvety a sweet murmuring huskiness that seemed to come more from her chest than from her throat
the buckskins hoofs clattered upon the gravelly flats of creek underneath the long trestle mind went back to the scene of the previous evening when he had come upon her at this place
he set his teeth with anger and disappointment
why had she not been able to understand
what was the matter with these women always set upon this marrying notion
was it not enough that he wanted her more than any other girl he knew and that she wanted him
she had said as much
did she think she was going to be mistress of quien sabe
ah that was it
she was after his property was for marrying him because of his money
his unconquerable suspicion of the woman his innate distrust of the feminine element would not be done away with
what fathomless duplicity was hers that she could appear so innocent
it was almost unbelievable in fact was it believable
for the first time doubt assailed him
suppose hilma was indeed all that she appeared to be
suppose it was not with her a question of his property after all it was a poor time to think of marrying him for his property when all quien sabe hung in the issue of the next few months
suppose she had been sincere
but he caught himself up
was he to be fooled by a feemale girl at this late date
he buck annixter crafty hardheaded a man of affairs
not much
whatever transpired he would remain the master
he reached quien sabe in this frame of mind
but at this hour annixter for all his resolutions could no longer control his thoughts
as he stripped the saddle from the buckskin and led her to the watering trough by the stable corral his heart was beating thick at the very notion of being near hilma again
it was growing dark but covertly he glanced here and there out of the corners of his eyes to see if she was anywhere about he could not become possessed of the idea that hilma would not inform her parents of what had passed between them the previous evening under the long trestle
he had no idea that matters were at an end between himself and the young woman
he must apologise he saw that clearly enough must eat crow as he told himself
well he would eat crow
he was not afraid of her any longer now that she had made her confession to him
he would see her as soon as possible and get this business straightened out and begin again from a new starting point
what he wanted with hilma annixter did not define clearly in his mind
at one time he had known perfectly well what he wanted
now the goal of his desires had become vague
he could not say exactly what it was
he preferred that things should go forward without much idea of consequences if consequences came they would do so naturally enough and of themselves all that he positively knew was that hilma occupied his thoughts morning noon and night that he was happy when he was with her and miserable when away from her
the chinese cook served his supper in silence
annixter ate and drank and lighted a cigar and after his meal sat on the porch of his house smoking and enjoying the twilight
the evening was beautiful warm the sky one powder of stars
from the direction of the stables he heard one of the portuguese hands picking a guitar
but he wanted to see hilma
the idea of going to bed without at least a glimpse of her became distasteful to him
annixter got up and descending from the porch began to walk aimlessly about between the ranch buildings with eye and ear alert
possibly he might meet her somewheres
the trees little house toward which inevitably annixter directed his steps was dark
had they all gone to bed so soon
he made a wide circuit about it listening but heard no sound
the door of the dairyhouse stood ajar
he pushed it open and stepped into the odorous darkness of its interior
the pans and deep cans of polished metal glowed faintly from the corners and from the walls
the smell of new cheese was pungent in his nostrils
everything was quiet
there was nobody there
he went out again closing the door and stood for a moment in the space between the dairyhouse and the new barn uncertain as to what he should do next
as he waited there his foreman came out of the mens bunk house on the other side of the kitchens and crossed over toward the barn
hello billy muttered annixter as he passed
oh good evening mr annixter said the other pausing in front of him didnot know you were back
by the way he added speaking as though the matter was already known to annixter see old man tree and his family have left us
are they going to be gone long
have they left for good that
annixter exclaimed
when did they go
did all of them go all three
why i thought you knew
sure they all left on the afternoon train for san francisco
cleared out in a all their trunks
yes all three young lady too
they gave me notice early this morning
they ainot ought to have done that
i donot know who to get to run the dairy on such short notice
do you know any one mr annixter
well why in hell did you let them go vociferated annixter
why didnot you keep them here till i got back
why didnot you find out if they were going for good
i canot be everywhere
what do i feed you for if it ainot to look after things i canot attend to
he turned on his heel and strode away straight before him not caring where he was going
he tramped out from the group of ranch buildings holding on over the open reach of his ranch his teeth set his heels digging furiously into the ground
the minutes passed
he walked on swiftly muttering to himself from time to time
gone by the lord
gone by the lord
by the lord harry shes cleared out
as yet his head was empty of all thought
he could not steady his wits to consider this new turn of affairs
he did not even try
gone by the lord he exclaimed
by the lord shes cleared out
he found the irrigating ditch and the beaten path made by the ditch tenders that bordered it and followed it some five minutes then struck off at right angles over the rugged surface of the ranch land to where a great white stone jutted from the ground
there he sat down and leaning forward rested his elbows on his knees and looked out vaguely into the night his thoughts swiftly readjusting themselves
he was alone
the silence of the night the infinite repose of the flat bare around and above him like illimitable seas
a grey halflight mysterious grave flooded downward from the stars
annixter was in torment
now there could be no longer any it was hilma or nothing
once out of his reach once lost to him and the recollection of her assailed him with unconquerable vehemence
much as she had occupied his mind he had never realised till now how vast had been the place she had filled in his life
he had told her as much but even then he did not believe it
suddenly a bitter rage against himself overwhelmed him as he thought of the hurt he had given her the previous evening
he should have managed differently
how he did not know but the sense of the outrage he had put upon her abruptly recoiled against him with cruel force
now he was sorry for it infinitely sorry passionately sorry
he had hurt her
he had brought the tears to her eyes
he had so flagrantly insulted her that she could no longer bear to breathe the same air with him
she had told her parents all
she had left quien left him for good at the very moment when he believed he had won her
brute beast that he was he had driven her away
an hour went by then two then four then six
annixter still sat in his place groping and battling in a confusion of spirit the like of which he had never felt before
he did not know what was the matter with him
he could not find his way out of the dark and out of the turmoil that wheeled around him
he had had no experience with women
there was no precedent to guide him
how was he to get out of this
what was the clew that would set everything straight again
that he would give hilma up never once entered his head
have her he would
she had given herself to him
everything should have been easy after that and instead here he was alone in the night wrestling with himself in deeper trouble than ever and hilma farther than ever away from him
it was true he might have hilma even now if he was willing to marry her
but marriage to his mind had been always a vague most remote possibility almost as vague and as remote as his thing that happened to some men but that would surely never occur to him or if it did it would be after long years had passed when he was older more settled more event that belonged to the period of his middle life distant as yet
he had never faced the question of his marriage
he had kept it at an immense distance from him
it had never been a part of his order of things
he was not a marrying man
but hilma was an everpresent reality as near to him as his right hand
marriage was a formless far distant abstraction
hilma a tangible imminent fact
before he could think of the two as one before he could consider the idea of marriage side by side with the idea of hilma measureless distances had to be traversed things as disassociated in his mind as fire and water had to be fused together and between the two he was torn as if upon a rack
slowly by imperceptible degrees the imagination unused unwilling machine began to work
the brains activity lapsed proportionately
he began to think less and feel more
in that rugged composition confused dark harsh a furrow had been driven deep a little seed planted a little seed at first weak forgotten lost in the lower dark places of his character
but as the intellect moved slower its functions growing numb the idea of self dwindled
annixter no longer considered himself no longer considered the notion of marriage from the point of view of his own comfort his own wishes his own advantage
he realised that in his newfound desire to make her happy he was sincere
there was something in that idea after all
to make some one about that now
it was worth thinking of
far away low down in the east a dim belt a grey light began to whiten over the horizon
the tower of the mission stood black against it
the dawn was coming
the baffling obscurity of the night was passing
hidden things were coming into view
annixter his eyes halfclosed his chin upon his fist allowed his imagination full play
how would it be if he should take hilma into his life this beautiful young girl pure as he now knew her to be innocent noble with the inborn nobility of dawning womanhood
an overwhelming sense of his own unworthiness suddenly bore down upon him with crushing force as he thought of this
he had gone about the whole affair wrongly
he had been mistaken from the very first
she was infinitely above him
he did not should not desire to be the master
it was she his servant poor simple lowly even who should condescend to him
abruptly there was presented to his minds eye a picture of the years to come if he now should follow his best his highest his most unselfish impulse
he saw hilma his own for better or for worse for richer or for poorer all barriers down between them he giving himself to her as freely as nobly as she had given herself to him
by a supreme effort not of the will but of the emotion he fought his way across that vast gulf that for a time had gaped between hilma and the idea of his marriage
instantly like the swift blending of beautiful colours like the harmony of beautiful chords of music the two ideas melted into one and in that moment into his harsh unlovely world a new idea was born
annixter stood suddenly upright a mighty tenderness a gentleness of spirit such as he had never conceived of in his heart strained swelled and in a moment seemed to burst
out of the dark furrows of his soul up from the deep rugged recesses of his being something rose expanding
he opened his arms wide
an immense happiness overpowered him
actual tears came to his eyes
without knowing why he was not ashamed of it
this poor crude fellow harsh hard narrow with his unlovely nature his fierce truculency his selfishness his obstinacy abruptly knew that all the sweetness of life all the great vivifying eternal force of humanity had burst into life within him
the little seed long since planted gathering strength quietly had at last germinated
then as the realisation of this hardened into certainty in the growing light of the new day that had just dawned for him annixter uttered a cry
now at length he knew the meaning of it all
whyii i her he cried
never until then had it occurred to him
never until then in all his thoughts of hilma had that great word passed his lips
it was a memnonian cry the greeting of the hard harsh image of man roughhewn flinty granitic uttering a note of joy acclaiming the new risen sun
by now it was almost day
the east glowed opalescent
all about him annixter saw the land inundated with light
but there was a change
overnight something had occurred
in his perturbation the change seemed to him at first elusive almost fanciful unreal
but now as the light spread he looked again at the gigantic scroll of ranch lands unrolled before him from edge to edge of the horizon
the change was not fanciful
the change was real
the earth was no longer bare
the land was no longer longer empty no longer dull brown
all at once annixter shouted aloud
there it was the wheat the wheat
the little seed long planted germinating in the deep dark furrows of the soil straining swelling suddenly in one night had burst upward to the light
the wheat had come up
it was there before him around him everywhere illimitable immeasurable
the winter brownness of the ground was overlaid with a little shimmer of green
the promise of the sowing was being fulfilled
the earth the loyal mother who never failed who never disappointed was keeping her faith again
once more the strength of nations was renewed
once more the force of the world was revivified
once more the titan benignant calm stirred and woke and the morning abruptly blazed into glory upon the spectacle of a man whose heart leaped exuberant with the love of a woman and an exulting earth gleaming transcendent with the radiant magnificence of an inviolable pledge room in the ranch house of los muertos was in the second story of the building
it was a corner room one of its windows facing the south the other the east
its appointments were of the simplest
in one angle was the small white painted iron bed covered with a white counterpane
the walls were hung with a white paper figured with knots of pale green leaves very gay and bright
there was a straw matting on the floor
white muslin halfcurtains hung in the windows upon the sills of which certain plants bearing pink waxen flowers of which presley did not know the name grew in oblong green boxes
the walls were unadorned save by two pictures one a reproduction of the reading from homer the other a charcoal drawing of the mission of san juan de guadalajara which presley had made himself
by the east window stood the plainest of deal tables innocent of any cloth or covering such as might have been used in a kitchen
it was work table and was invariably littered with papers halffinished manuscripts drafts of poems notebooks pens halfsmoked cigarettes and the like
near at hand upon a shelf were his books
there were but two chairs in the straight backed wooden chair that stood in front of the table angular upright and in which it was impossible to take ones ease and the long comfortable wicker steamer chair stretching its length in front of the south window
presley was immensely fond of this room
it amused and interested him to maintain its air of rigorous simplicity and freshness
he abhorred cluttered and meaningless objets dart
once in so often he submitted his room to a vigorous inspection setting it to rights removing everything but the essentials the few ornaments which in a way were part of his life
his writing had by this time undergone a complete change
the notes for his great song of the west the epic poem he once had hoped to write he had flung aside together with all the abortive attempts at its beginning
also he had torn up a great quantity of fugitive verses preserving only a certain halffinished poem that he called the toilers
this poem was a comment upon the social fabric and had been inspired by the sight of a painting he had seen in art gallery
he had written all but the last verse
on the day that he had overheard the conversation between dyke and caraher in the latters saloon which had acquainted him with the monstrous injustice of the increased tariff presley had returned to los muertos white and trembling roused to a pitch of exaltation the like of which he had never known in all his life
his wrath was little short of even he too saw red a mighty spirit of revolt heaved tumultuous within him
it did not seem possible that this outrage could go on much longer
the oppression was incredible the plain story of it set down in truthful statement of fact would not be believed by the outside world
he went up to his little room and paced the floor with clenched fists and burning face till at last the repression of his contending thoughts all but suffocated him and he flung himself before his table and began to write
for a time his pen seemed to travel of itself words came to him without searching shaping themselves into phrases building themselves up to great forcible sentences full of eloquence of fire of passion
as his prose grew more exalted it passed easily into the domain of poetry
soon the cadence of his paragraphs settled to an ordered beat and rhythm and in the end presley had thrust aside his journal and was once more writing verse
he picked up his incomplete poem of the toilers read it hastily a couple of times to catch its swing then the idea of the last idea for which he so long had sought in springing to his brain wrote it off without so much as replenishing his pen with ink
he added still another verse bringing the poem to a definite close resuming its entire conception and ending with a single majestic thought simple noble dignified absolutely convincing
presley laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair with the certainty that for one moment he had touched untrod heights
his hands were cold his head on fire his heart leaping tumultuous in his breast
now at last he had achieved
he saw why he had never grasped the inspiration for his vast vague song of the west
at the time when he sought for it his convictions had not been aroused he had not then cared for the people
his sympathies had not been touched
small wonder that he had missed it
now he was of the people he had been stirred to his lowest depths
his earnestness was almost a frenzy
he and so to him all things were possible at once
then the artist in him reasserted itself
he became more interested in his poem as such than in the cause that had inspired it
he went over it again retouching it carefully changing a word here and there and improving its rhythm
for the moment he forgot the people forgot his rage his agitation of the previous hour he remembered only that he had written a great poem
then doubt intruded
after all was it so great
did not its sublimity overpass a little the bounds of the ridiculous
had he seen true
had he failed again
he reread the poem carefully and it seemed all at once to lose force
by now presley could not tell whether what he had written was true poetry or doggerel
he distrusted profoundly his own judgment
he must have the opinion of some one else some one competent to judge
he could not wait tomorrow would not do
he must know to a certainty before he could rest that night
he made a careful copy of what he had written and putting on his hat and laced boots went down stairs and out upon the lawn crossing over to the stables
he found phelps there washing down the buckboard
do you know where vanamee is today he asked the latter
phelps put his chin in the air
ask me something easy he responded
he might be at guadalajara or he might be up at or he might be a hundred miles away from either place
i know where he ought to be mr presley but that ainot saying where the crazy gesabe is
he to be rangeriding over east of four at the head waters of mission creek try for him there at all events answered presley
if you see harran when he comes in tell him i may not be back in time for supper
presley found the pony in the corral cinched the saddle upon him and went off over the lower road going eastward at a brisk canter
at he called a how do you do to minna whom he saw lying in a slat hammock under the mammoth live oak her foot in bandages and then galloped on over the bridge across the irrigating ditch wondering vaguely what would become of such a pretty girl as minna and if in the end she would marry the portuguese foreman in charge of the ditchinggang
he told himself that he hoped she would and that speedily
there was no lack of comment as to minna hooven about the ranches
certainly she was a good girl but she was seen at all hours here and there about bonneville and guadalajara skylarking with the portuguese farm hands of quien sabe and los muertos
she was very pretty the men made fools of themselves over her
presley hoped they would not end by making a fool of her
just beyond the irrigating ditch presley left the lower road and following a trail that branched off southeasterly from this point held on across the fourth division of the ranch keeping the mission creek on his left
a few miles farther on he went through a gate in a barbed wire fence and at once engaged himself in a system of little arroyos and low rolling hills that steadily lifted and increased in size as he proceeded
this higher ground was the advance guard of the sierra foothills and served as the stock range for los muertos
the hills were huge rolling hummocks of bare ground covered only by wild oats
at long intervals were isolated live oaks
in the canyons and arroyos the chaparral and manzanita grew in dark olivegreen thickets
the ground was honeycombed with gopherholes and the gophers themselves were everywhere
occasionally a jack rabbit bounded across the open from one growth of chaparral to another taking long leaps his ears erect
high overhead a hawk or two swung at anchor and once with a startling rush of wings a covey of quail flushed from the brush at the side of the trail
on the hillsides in thinly scattered groups were the cattle grazing deliberately working slowly toward the waterholes for their evening drink the horses keeping to themselves the colts nuzzling at their mothers bellies whisking their tails stamping their unshod feet
but once in a remoter field solitary magnificent enormous the short hair curling tight upon his forehead his small red eyes twinkling his vast neck heavy with muscles presley came upon the monarch the king the great durham bull maintaining his lonely state unapproachable austere
presley found the onetime shepherd by a waterhole in a far distant corner of the range
he had made his simple camp for the night
his bluegrey army blanket lay spread under a live oak his horse grazed near at hand
he himself sat on his heels before a little fire of dead manzanita roots cooking his coffee and bacon
never had presley conceived so keen an impression of loneliness as his crouching figure presented
the bald bare landscape widened about him to infinity
vanamee was a spot in it all a tiny dot a single atom of human organisation floating endlessly on the ocean of an illimitable nature
the two friends ate together and vanamee having snared a brace of quails dressed and then roasted them on a sharpened stick
after eating they drank great refreshing draughts from the waterhole
then at length presley having lit his cigarette and vanamee his pipe the former said vanamee i have been writing again
vanamee turned his lean ascetic face toward him his black eyes fixed attentively know he said your journal
no this is a poem
you remember i told you about it once
the toilers i called it
oh verse
well i am glad you have gone back to it
it is your natural vehicle
you remember the poem asked presley
it was unfinished
yes i remember it
there was better promise in it than anything you ever wrote
now i suppose you have finished it
without reply presley brought it from out the breast pocket of his shooting coat
the moment seemed propitious
the stillness of the vast bare hills was profound
the sun was setting in a cloudless brazier of red light a golden dust pervaded all the landscape
presley read his poem aloud
when he had finished his friend looked at him
what have you been doing lately he demanded
presley wondering told of his various comings and goings donot mean that returned the other
something has happened to you something has aroused you
i am right am i not
yes i thought so
in this poem of yours you have not been trying to make a sounding piece of literature
you wrote it under tremendous stress
its very imperfections show that
it is better than a mere rhyme
it is an message
it is truth
you have come back to the primal heart of things and you have seen clearly
yes it is a great poem
thank you exclaimed presley fervidly had begun to mistrust myself
now observed vanamee presume you will rush it into print
to have formulated a great thought simply to have accomplished is not enough think i am sincere objected presley
if it is good it will do good to others
you said yourself it was a message
if it has any value i do not think it would be right to keep it back from even a very small and most indifferent public publish it in the magazines at all events vanamee answered
your inspiration has come the people
then let it go straight the the literary readers of the monthly periodicals the rich who would only be indirectly interested
if you must publish it let it be in the daily press interrupt
i know what you will say
it will be that the daily press is common is vulgar is undignified and i tell you that such a poem as this of yours called as it is the toilers must be read the toilers
it common it must be vulgarised
you must not stand upon your dignity with the people if you are to reach them
that is true i suppose presley admitted but i canot get rid of the idea that it would be throwing my poem away
the great magazine gives me suchabackground gives me such weight
gives such weight gives you such background
is it you think of
you helper of the helpless
is that your sincerity
you must sink yourself must forget yourself and your own desire of fame of admitted success
it is your your that must who wrote it
you preach a doctrine of abnegation of selfobliteration and you sign your name to your words as high on the tablets as you can reach so that all the world may see not the poem but the poet
presley there are many like you
the social reformer writes a book on the iniquity of the possession of land and out of the proceeds buys a corner lot
the economist who laments the hardships of the poor allows himself to grow rich upon the sale of his book
but presley would hear no further
no he cried know i am sincere and to prove it to you i will publish my poem as you say in the daily press and i will accept no money for it
they talked on for about an hour while the evening wore away
presley very soon noticed that vanamee was again preoccupied
more than ever of late his silence his brooding had increased
by and by he rose abruptly turning his head to the north in the direction of the mission church of san juan think he said to presley that i must be going
going
where to at this time of night
off there
vanamee made an uncertain gesture toward the north and without another word he disappeared in the grey of the twilight
presley was left alone wondering
he found his horse and tightening the girths mounted and rode home under the sheen of the stars thoughtful his head bowed
before he went to bed that night he sent the toilers to the sunday editor of a daily newspaper in san francisco
upon leaving presley vanamee his thumbs hooked into his empty cartridge belt strode swiftly down from the hills of the los muertos stockrange and on through the silent town of guadalajara
his lean swarthy face with its hollow cheeks fine black pointed beard and sad eyes was set to the northward
as was his custom he was bareheaded and the rapidity of his stride made a breeze in his long black hair
he knew where he was going
he knew what he must live through that night
again the deathless grief that never slept leaped out of the shadows and fastened upon his shoulders
it was scourging him back to that scene of a vanished happiness a dead romance a perished mission garden in the shade of the venerable pear trees
but besides this other influences tugged at his heart
there was a mystery in the garden
in that spot the night was not always empty the darkness not always silent
something far off stirred and listened to his cry at times drawing nearer to him
at first this presence had been a matter for terror but of late as he felt it gradually drawing nearer the terror had at long intervals given place to a feeling of an almost ineffable sweetness
but distrusting his own senses unwilling to submit himself to such torturing uncertain happiness averse to the terrible confusion of spirit that followed upon a night spent in the garden vanamee had tried to keep away from the place
however when the sorrow of his life reassailed him and the thoughts and recollections of angele brought the ache into his heart and the tears to his eyes the temptation to return to the garden invariably gripped him close
there were times when he could not resist
of themselves his footsteps turned in that direction
it was almost as if he himself had been called
guadalajara was silent dark
not even in was there a light
the town was asleep
only the inevitable guitar hummed from an unseen dobe
vanamee pushed on
the smell of the fields and open country and a distant scent of flowers that he knew well came to his nostrils as he emerged from the town by way of the road that led on towards the mission through quien sabe
on either side of him lay the brown earth silently nurturing the implanted seed
two days before it had rained copiously and the soil still moist disengaged a pungent aroma of fecundity
vanamee following the road passed through the collection of buildings of home ranch
everything slept
at intervals the aermotor on the artesian well creaked audibly as it turned in a languid breeze from the northeast
a cat hunting fieldmice crept from the shadow of the gigantic barn and paused uncertainly in the open the tip of her tail twitching
from within the barn itself came the sound of the friction of a heavy body and a stir of hoofs as one of the dozing cows lay down with a long breath
vanamee left the ranch house behind him and proceeded on his way
beyond him to the right of the road he could make out the higher ground in the mission enclosure and the watching tower of the mission itself
the minutes passed
he went steadily forward
then abruptly he paused his head in the air eye and ear alert
to that strange sixth sense of his responsive as the leaves of the sensitive plant had suddenly come the impression of a human being near at hand
he had neither seen nor heard but for all that he stopped an instant in his tracks then the sensation confirmed went on again with slow steps advancing warily
at last his swiftly roving eyes lighted upon an object just darker than the greybrown of the nightridden land
it was at some distance from the roadside
vanamee approached it cautiously leaving the road treading carefully upon the moist clods of earth underfoot
twenty paces distant he halted
annixter was there seated upon a round white rock his back towards him
he was leaning forward his elbows on his knees his chin in his hands
he did not move
silent motionless he gazed out upon the flat sombre land
it was the night wherein the master of quien sabe wrought out his salvation struggling with self from dusk to dawn
at the moment when vanamee came upon him the turmoil within him had only begun
the heart of the man had not yet wakened
the night was young the dawn far distant and all around him the fields of upturned clods lay bare and brown empty of all life unbroken by a single green shoot
for a moment the lifecircles of these two men of so widely differing characters touched each other there in the silence of the night under the stars
then silently vanamee withdrew going on his way wondering at the trouble that like himself drove this hardheaded man of affairs untroubled by dreams out into the night to brood over an empty land
then speedily he forgot all else
the material world drew off from him
reality dwindled to a point and vanished like the vanishing of a star at moonrise
earthly things dissolved and disappeared as a strange unnamed essence flowed in upon him
a new atmosphere for him pervaded his surroundings
he entered the world of the vision of the legend of the miracle where all things were possible
he stood at the gate of the mission garden
above him rose the ancient tower of the mission church
through the arches at its summit where swung the spanish queens bells he saw the slowburning stars
the silent bats with flickering wings threw their dancing shadows on the pallid surface of the venerable facade
not the faintest chirring of a cricket broke the silence
the bees were asleep
in the grasses in the trees deep in the calix of punka flower and magnolia bloom the gnats the caterpillars the beetles all the microscopic multitudinous life of the daytime drowsed and dozed
not even the minute scuffling of a lizard over the warm worn pavement of the colonnade disturbed the infinite repose the profound stillness
only within the garden the intermittent trickling of the fountain made itself heard flowing steadily marking off the lapse of seconds the progress of hours the cycle of years the inevitable march of centuries
at one time the doorway before which vanamee now stood had been hermetically closed
but he himself had long since changed that
he stood before it for a moment steeping himself in the mystery and romance of the place then raising he latch pushed open the gate entered and closed it softly behind him
he was in the cloister garden
the stars were out strewn thick and close in the deep blue of the sky the milky way glowing like a silver veil
ursa major wheeled gigantic in the north
the great nebula in orion was a whorl of shimmering star dust
venus flamed a lambent disk of pale saffron low over the horizon
from edge to edge of the world marched the constellations like the progress of emperors and from the innumerable glory of their courses a mysterious sheen of diaphanous light disengaged itself expanding over all the earth serene infinite majestic
the little garden revealed itself but dimly beneath the brooding light only half emerging from the shadow
the polished surfaces of the leaves of the pear trees winked faintly back the reflected light as the trees just stirred in the uncertain breeze
a blurred shield of silver marked the ripples of the fountain
under the flood of dull blue lustre the gravelled walks lay vague amid the grasses like webs of white satin on the bed of a lake
against the eastern wall the headstones of the graves an indistinct procession of grey cowls ranged themselves
vanamee crossed the garden pausing to kiss the turf upon grave
then he approached the line of pear trees and laid himself down in their shadow his chin propped upon his hands his eyes wandering over the expanse of the little valley that stretched away from the foot of the hill upon which the mission was built
once again he summoned the vision
once again he conjured up the illusion
once again tortured with doubt racked with a deathless grief he craved an answer of the night
once again mystic that he was he sent his mind out from him across the enchanted sea of the supernatural
hope of what he did not know roused up within him
surely on such a night as this the hallucination must define itself
surely the manifestation must be vouchsafed
his eyes closed his will girding itself to a supreme effort his senses exalted to a state of pleasing numbness he called upon angele to come to him his voiceless cry penetrating far out into that sea of faint ephemeral light that floated tideless over the little valley beneath him
then motionless prone upon the ground he waited
months had passed since that first night when at length an answer had come to vanamee
at first startled out of all composure troubled and stirred to his lowest depths because of the very thing for which he sought he resolved never again to put his strange powers to the test
but for all that he had come a second night to the garden and a third and a fourth
at last his visits were habitual
night after night he was there surrendering himself to the influences of the place gradually convinced that something did actually answer when he called
his faith increased as the winter grew into spring
as the spring advanced and the nights became shorter it crystallised into certainty
would he have her again his love long dead
would she come to him once more out of the grave out of the night
he could not tell he could only hope
all that he knew was that his cry found an answer that his outstretched hands groping in the darkness met the touch of other fingers
patiently he waited
the nights became warmer as the spring drew on
the stars shone clearer
the nights seemed brighter
for nearly a month after the occasion of his first answer nothing new occurred
some nights it failed him entirely upon others it was faint illusive
then at last the most subtle the barest of perceptible changes began
his groping mind faroff there wandering like a lost bird over the valley touched upon some thing again touched and held it and this time drew it a single step closer to him
his heart beating the blood surging in his temples he watched with the eyes of his imagination this gradual approach
what was coming to him
who was coming to him
shrouded in the obscurity of the night whose was the face now turned towards his
whose the footsteps that with such infinite slowness drew nearer to where he waited
he did not dare to say
his mind went back many years to that time before the tragedy of death before the mystery of the other
he waited then as he waited now
but then he had not waited in vain
then as now he had seemed to feel her approach seemed to feel her drawing nearer and nearer to their rendezvous
now what would happen
he did not know
he waited
he waited hoping all things
he waited believing all things
he waited enduring all things
he trusted in the vision
meanwhile as spring advanced the flowers in the seed ranch began to come to life
over the five hundred acres whereon the flowers were planted the widening growth of vines and bushes spread like the waves of a green sea
then timidly colours of the faintest tints began to appear
under the moonlight vanamee saw them expanding delicate pink faint blue tenderest variations of lavender and yellow white shimmering with reflections of gold all subdued and pallid in the moonlight
by degrees the night became impregnated with the perfume of the flowers
illusive at first evanescent as filaments of gossamer then as the buds opened emphasising itself breathing deeper stronger
an exquisite mingling of many odours passed continually over the mission from the garden of the seed ranch meeting and blending with the aroma of its magnolia buds and punka blossoms
as the colours of the flowers of the seed ranch deepened and as their odours penetrated deeper and more distinctly as the starlight of each succeeding night grew brighter and the air became warmer the illusion defined itself
by imperceptible degrees as vanamee waited under the shadows of the pear trees the answer grew nearer and nearer
he saw nothing but the distant glimmer of the flowers
he heard nothing but the drip of the fountain
nothing moved about him but the invisible slowpassing breaths of perfume yet he felt the approach of the vision
it came first to about the middle of the seed ranch itself some half a mile away where the violets grew shrinking timid flowers hiding close to the ground
then it passed forward beyond the violets and drew nearer and stood amid the mignonette hardier blooms that dared look heavenward from out the leaves
a few nights later it left the mignonette behind and advanced into the beds of white iris that pushed more boldly forth from the earth their waxen petals claiming the attention
it advanced then a long step into the proud challenging beauty of the carnations and roses and at last after many nights vanamee felt that it paused as if trembling at its hardihood full in the superb glory of the royal lilies themselves that grew on the extreme border of the seed ranch nearest to him
after this there was a certain long wait
then upon a dark midnight it advanced again
vanamee could scarcely repress a cry
now the illusion emerged from the flowers
it stood not distant but unseen almost at the base of the hill upon whose crest he waited in a depression of the ground where the shadows lay thickest
it was nearly within earshot
the nights passed
the spring grew warmer
in the daytime intermittent rains freshened all the earth
the flowers of the seed ranch grew rapidly
bud after bud burst forth while those already opened expanded to full maturity
the colour of the seed ranch deepened
one night after hours of waiting vanamee felt upon his cheek the touch of a prolonged puff of warm wind breathing across the little valley from out the east
it reached the mission garden and stirred the branches of the pear trees
it seemed veritably to be compounded of the very essence of the flowers
never had the aroma been so sweet so pervasive
it passed and faded leaving in its wake an absolute silence
then at length the silence of the night that silence to which vanamee had so long appealed was broken by a tiny sound
alert halfrisen from the ground he listened for now at length he heard something
the sound repeated itself
it came from near at hand from the thick shadow at the foot of the hill
what it was he could not tell but it did not belong to a single one of the infinite similar noises of the place with which he was so familiar
it was neither the rustle of a leaf the snap of a parted twig the drone of an insect the dropping of a magnolia blossom
it was a vibration merely faint elusive impossible of definition a minute notch in the fine keen edge of stillness
again the nights passed
the summer stars became brighter
the warmth increased
the flowers of the seed ranch grew still more
the five hundred acres of the ranch were carpeted with them
at length upon a certain midnight a new light began to spread in the sky
the thin scimitar of the moon rose veiled and dim behind the earthmists
the light increased
distant objects until now hidden came into view and as the radiance brightened vanamee looking down upon the little valley saw a spectacle of incomparable beauty
all the buds of the seed ranch had opened
the faint tints of the flowers had deepened had asserted themselves
they challenged the eye
pink became a royal red
blue rose into purple
yellow flamed into orange
orange glowed golden and brilliant
the earth disappeared under great bands and fields of resplendent colour
then at length the moon abruptly soared zenithward from out the veiling mist passing from one filmy haze to another
for a moment there was a gleam of a golden light and vanamee his eyes searching the shade at the foot of the hill felt his heart suddenly leap and then hang poised refusing to beat
in that instant of passing light something had caught his eye
something that moved down there half in and half out of the shadow at the hills foot
it had come and gone in an instant
the haze once more screened the moonlight
the shade again engulfed the vision
what was it he had seen
he did not know
so brief had been that movement the drowsy brain had not been quick enough to interpret the cipher message of the eye
now it was gone
but something had been there
he had seen it
was it the lifting of a strand of hair the wave of a white hand the flutter of a garments edge
he could not tell but it did not belong to any of those sights which he had seen so often in that place
it was neither the glancing of a moths wing the nodding of a windtouched blossom nor the noiseless flitting of a bat
it was a gleam merely faint elusive impossible of definition an intangible agitation in the vast dim blur of the darkness
and that was all
until now no single real thing had occurred nothing that vanamee could reduce to terms of actuality nothing he could put into words
the manifestation when not recognisable to that strange sixth sense of his appealed only to the most refined the most delicate perception of eye and ear
it was all ephemeral filmy dreamy the mystic forming of the invisible developing a concrete nucleus the starlight coagulating the radiance of the flowers thickening to something actual perfume the most delicious fragrance becoming a tangible presence
but into that garden the serpent intruded
though cradled in the slow rhythm of the dream lulled by this beauty of a summers night heavy with the scent of flowers the silence broken only by a rippling fountain the darkness illuminated by a world of radiant blossoms vanamee could not forget the tragedy of the other that terror of many years prowler of the night that strange fearful figure with the unseen face swooping in there from out the darkness gone in an instant yet leaving behind the trail and trace of death and of pollution
never had vanamee seen this more clearly than when leaving presley on the stock range of los muertos he had come across to the mission garden by way of the quien sabe ranch
it was the same night in which annixter outwatched the stars coming at last to himself
as the hours passed the two men far apart ignoring each other waited for the on the ranch vanamee in the garden
prone upon his face under the pear trees his forehead buried in the hollow of his arm vanamee lay motionless
for the last time raising his head he sent his voiceless cry out into the night across the multicoloured levels of the little valley calling upon the miracle summoning the darkness to give angele back to him resigning himself to the hallucination
he bowed his head upon his arm again and waited
the minutes passed
the fountain dripped steadily
over the hills a haze of saffron light foretold the rising of the full moon
nothing stirred
the silence was profound
then abruptly right hand shut tight upon his wrist it was
it began again his invocation was answered
far off there the ripple formed again upon the still black pool of the night
no sound no sight vibration merely appreciable by some sublimated faculty of the mind as yet unnamed
rigid his nerves taut motionless prone on the ground he waited
it advanced with infinite slowness
now it passed through the beds of violets now through the mignonette
a moment later and he knew it stood among the white iris
then it left those behind
it was in the splendour of the red roses and carnations
it passed like a moving star into the superb abundance the imperial opulence of the royal lilies
it was advancing slowly but there was no pause
he held his breath not daring to raise his head
it passed beyond the limits of the seed ranch and entered the shade at the foot of the hill below him
would it come farther than this
here it had always stopped hitherto stopped for a moment and then in spite of his efforts had slipped from his grasp and faded back into the night
but now he wondered if he had been willing to put forth his utmost strength after all
had there not always been an element of dread in the thought of beholding the mystery face to face
had he not even allowed the vision to dissolve the answer to recede into the obscurity whence it came
but never a night had been so beautiful as this
it was the full period of the spring
the air was a veritable caress
the infinite repose of the little garden sleeping under the night was delicious beyond expression
it was a tiny corner of the world shut off discreet distilling romance a garden of dreams of enchantments
below in the little valley the resplendent colourations of the million flowers roses lilies hyacinths carnations violets glowed like incandescence in the golden light of the rising moon
the air was thick with the perfume heavy with it clogged with it
the sweetness filled the very mouth
the throat choked with it
overhead wheeled the illimitable procession of the constellations
underfoot the earth was asleep
the very flowers were dreaming
a cathedral hush overlay all the land and a sense of benediction brooded divine kindliness manifesting itself in beauty in peace in absolute repose
it was a time for visions
it was the hour when dreams come true and lying deep in the grasses beneath the pear trees vanamee dizzied with mysticism reaching up and out toward the supernatural felt as it were his mind begin to rise upward from out his body
he passed into a state of being the like of which he had not known before
he felt that his imagination was reshaping itself preparing to receive an impression never experienced until now
his body felt light to him then it dwindled vanished
he saw with new eyes heard with new ears felt with a new heart
come to me he murmured
then slowly he felt the advance of the vision
it was approaching
every instant it drew gradually nearer
at last he was to see
it had left the shadow at the base of the hill it was on the hill itself
slowly steadily it ascended the slope just below him there he heard a faint stirring
the grasses rustled under the touch of a foot
the leaves of the bushes murmured as a hand brushed against them a slender twig creaked
the sounds of approach were more distinct
they came nearer
they reached the top of the hill
they were within whispering distance
vanamee trembling kept his head buried in his arm
the sounds at length paused definitely
the vision could come no nearer
he raised his head and looked
the moon had risen
its great shield of gold stood over the eastern horizon
within six feet of vanamee clear and distinct against the disk of the moon stood the figure of a young girl
she was dressed in a gown of scarlet silk with flowing sleeves such as japanese wear embroidered with flowers and figures of birds worked in gold threads
on either side of her face making threecornered her round white forehead hung the soft masses of her hair of gold
her hands hung limply at her sides
but from between her parted of almost an egyptian breath came slow and regular and her eyes heavy lidded slanting upwards toward the temples perplexing oriental were closed
she was asleep
from out this life of flowers this world of colour this atmosphere oppressive with perfume this darkness clogged and cloyed and thickened with sweet odours she came to him
she came to him from out of the flowers the smell of the roses in her hair of gold the aroma and the imperial red of the carnations in her lips the whiteness of the lilies the perfume of the lilies and the lilies slender balancing grace in her neck
her hands disengaged the scent of the heliotrope
the folds of her scarlet gown gave off the enervating smell of poppies
her feet were redolent of hyacinth
she stood before him a vision dream come true
she emerged from out the invisible
he beheld her a figure of gold and pale vermilion redolent of perfume poised motionless in the faint saffron sheen of the newrisen moon
she a creation of sleep was herself asleep
she a dream was herself dreaming
called forth from out the darkness from the grip of the earth the embrace of the grave from out the memory of corruption she rose into light and life divinely pure
across that white forehead was no smudge no trace of an earthly mark of a terrestrial dishonour
he saw in her the same beauty of untainted innocence he had known in his youth
years had made no difference with her
she was still young
it was the old purity that returned the deathless beauty the everrenascent life the eternal consecrated and immortal youth
for a few seconds she stood there before him and he upon the ground at her feet looked up at her spellbound
then slowly she withdrew
still asleep her eyelids closed she turned from him descending the slope
she was gone
vanamee started up coming as it were to himself looking wildly about him
sarria was there saw her said the priest
it was angele the little girl your daughter
she is like her mother
but vanamee scarcely heard
he walked as if in a trance pushing by sarria going forth from the garden
angele or daughter it was all one with him
it was she
death was overcome
the grave vanquished
life everrenewed alone existed
time was naught change was naught all things were immortal but evil all things eternal but grief
suddenly the dawn came the east burned roseate toward the zenith
vanamee walked on he knew not where
the dawn grew brighter
at length he paused upon the crest of a hill overlooking the ranchos and cast his eye below him to the southward
then suddenly flinging up his arms he uttered a great cry
there it was
the wheat
the wheat
in the night it had come up
it was there everywhere from margin to margin of the horizon
the earth long empty teemed with green life
once more the pendulum of the seasons swung in its mighty arc from death back to life
life out of death eternity rising from out dissolution
there was the lesson
angele was not the symbol but the of immortality
the seed dying rotting and corrupting in the earth rising again in life unconquerable and in immaculate dying as she gave birth to her little daughter life springing from her pure unconquerable coming forth from the defiled
why had he not had the knowledge of god
thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die
so the seed had died
so died angele
and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain
it may chance of wheat or of some other grain
the wheat called forth from out the darkness from out the grip of the earth of the grave from out corruption rose triumphant into light and life
so angele so life so also the resurrection of the dead
it is sown in corruption
it is raised in incorruption
it is sown in dishonour
it is raised in glory
it is sown in weakness
it is raised in power
death was swallowed up in victory
the sun rose
the night was over
the glory of the terrestrial was one and the glory of the celestial was another
then as the glory of sun banished the lesser glory of moon and stars vanamee from his mountain top beholding the eternal green life of the growing wheat bursting its bonds and in his heart exulting in his triumph over the grave flung out his arms with a mighty shout oh death where is thy sting
oh grave where is thy victory
socialistic poem the toilers had an enormous success
the editor of the sunday supplement of the san francisco paper to which it was sent printed it in gothic type with a scarehead title so decorative as to be almost illegible and furthermore caused the poem to be illustrated by one of the papers staff artists in a most impressive fashion
the whole affair occupied an entire page
thus advertised the poem attracted attention
it was promptly copied in new york boston and chicago papers
it was discussed attacked defended eulogised ridiculed
it was praised with the most fulsome adulation assailed with the most violent condemnation
editorials were written upon it
special articles in literary pamphlets dissected its rhetoric and prosody
the phrases were used as texts for revolutionary sermons reactionary speeches
it was parodied it was distorted so as to read as an advertisement for patented cereals and infants foods
finally the editor of an enterprising monthly magazine reprinted the poem supplementing it by a photograph and biography of presley himself
presley was stunned bewildered
he began to wonder at himself
was he actually the greatest american poet since bryant
he had had no thought of fame while composing the toilers
he had only been moved to his hearts in earnest seeing had addressed himself to the poems composition in a happy moment when words came easily to him and the elaboration of fine sentences was not difficult
was it thus fame was achieved
for a while he was tempted to cross the continent and go to new york and there come unto his own enjoying the triumph that awaited him
but soon he denied himself this cheap reward
now he was too much in earnest
he wanted to help his people the community in which he little world of the san joaquin at grapples with the railroad
the struggle had found its poet
he told himself that his place was here
only the words of the manager of a lecture bureau troubled him for a moment
to range the entire nation telling all his countrymen of the drama that was working itself out on this fringe of the continent this ignored and distant pacific coast rousing their interest and stirring them up to to him
it might do great good
to devote himself to the cause accepting no penny of remuneration to give his life to loosing the grip of the ironhearted monster of steel and steam would be beyond question heroic
other states than california had their grievances
all over the country the family of cyclops was growing
he would declare himself the champion of the people in their opposition to the trust
he would be an apostle a prophet a martyr of freedom
but presley was essentially a dreamer not a man of affairs
he hesitated to act at this precise psychological moment striking while the iron was yet hot and while he hesitated other affairs near at hand began to absorb his attention
one night about an hour after he had gone to bed he was awakened by the sound of voices on the porch of the ranch house and descending found mrs dyke there with sidney
the mother was talking to magnus and harran and crying as she talked
it seemed that dyke was missing
he had gone into town early that afternoon with the wagon and team and was to have been home for supper
by now it was ten oclock and there was no news of him
mrs dyke told how she first had gone to quien sabe intending to telephone from there to bonneville but annixter was in san francisco and in his absence the house was locked up and the overseer who had a duplicate key was himself in bonneville
she had telegraphed three times from guadalajara to bonneville for news of her son but without result
then at last tortured with anxiety she had gone to taking sidney with her and had prevailed upon bismarck to hitch up and drive her across los muertos to the to beg him to telephone into bonneville to know what had become of dyke
while harran rang up central in town mrs dyke told presley and magnus of the lamentable change in dyke
they have broken my sons spirit mr derrick she said
if you were only there to see
hour after hour he sits on the porch with his hands lying open in his lap looking at them without a word
he wonot look me in the face any more and he donot sleep
night after night he has walked the floor until morning
and he will go on that way for days together very silent without a word and sitting still in his chair and then all of a sudden he will break outoh mr derrick it is an awful rage cursing swearing grinding his teeth his hands clenched over his head stamping so that the house shakes and saying that if behrman donot give him back his money he will kill him with his two hands
but that isnot the worst mr derrick
he goes to mr saloon now and stays there for hours and listens to mr caraher
there is something on my sons mind i know there that he and mr caraher have talked over together and i canot find out what it is
mr caraher is a bad man and my son has fallen under his influence
the tears filled her eyes
bravely she turned to hide them turning away to take sidney in her arms putting her head upon the little girls shoulder havenot broken down before mr derrick she said but after we have been so happy in our little house just us the future seemed so brightoh god will punish the gentlemen who own the railroad for being so hard and cruel
harran came out on the porch from the telephone and she interrupted herself fixing her eyes eagerly upon him think it is all right mrs dyke he said reassuringly
we know where he is i believe
you and the little tad stay here and hooven and i will go after him
about two hours later harran brought dyke back to los muertos in wagon
he had found him at saloon very drunk
there was nothing maudlin about drunkenness
in him the alcohol merely roused the spirit of evil vengeful reckless
as the wagon passed out from under the eucalyptus trees about the ranch house taking mrs dyke sidney and the onetime engineer back to the hop ranch presley leaning from his window heard the latter remark caraher is right
there is only one thing they listen to and thats dynamite
the following day presley drove magnus over to guadalajara to take the train for san francisco
but after he had said goodbye to the governor he was moved to go on to the hop ranch to see the condition of affairs in that quarter
he returned to los muertos overwhelmed with sadness and trembling with anger
the hop ranch that he had last seen in the full tide of prosperity was almost a ruin
work had evidently been abandoned long since
weeds were already choking the vines
everywhere the poles sagged and drooped
many had even fallen dragging the vines with them spreading them over the ground in an inextricable tangle of dead leaves decaying tendrils and snarled string
the fence was broken the unfinished storehouse which never was to see completion was a lamentable spectacle of gaping doors and melancholy skeleton
last of all presley had caught a glimpse of dyke himself seated in his rocking chair on the porch his beard and hair unkempt motionless looking with vague eyes upon his hands that lay palm upwards and idle in his lap
magnus on his way to san francisco was joined at bonneville by osterman
upon seating himself in front of the master of los muertos in the smokingcar of the train this latter pushing back his hat and smoothing his bald head observed governor you look all frazeled out
anything wrong these days
the other answered in the negative but for all that osterman was right
the governor had aged suddenly
his former erectness was gone the broad shoulders stooped a little the strong lines of his thinlipped mouth were relaxed and his hand as it clasped over the yellowed ivory knob of his cane had an unwonted tremulousness not hitherto noticeable
but the change in magnus was more than physical
at last in the full tide of power president of the league known and talked of in every county of the state leader in a great struggle consulted deferred to as the prominent man at length attaining that position so long and vainly sought for he yet found no pleasure in his triumph and little but bitterness in life
his success had come by devious methods had been reached by obscure means
he was a briber
he could never forget that
to further his ends disinterested publicspirited even philanthropic as those were he had connived with knavery he the politician of the old school of such rigorous integrity who had abandoned a career rather than compromise with honesty
at this eleventh hour involved and entrapped in the finespun web of a new order of things bewildered by dexterity by his volubility and glibness goaded and harassed beyond the point of reason by the aggression of the trust he fought he had at last failed
he had fallen he had given a bribe
he had thought that after all this would make but little difference with him
the affair was known only to osterman broderson and annixter they would not judge him being themselves involved
he could still preserve a bold front could still hold his head high
as time went on the affair would lose its point
but this was not so
some subtle element of his character had forsaken him
he felt it
he knew it
some certain stiffness that had given him all his rigidity that had lent force to his authority weight to his dominance temper to his fine inflexible hardness was diminishing day by day
in the decisions which he as president of the league was called upon to make so often he now hesitated
he could no longer be arrogant masterful acting upon his own judgment independent of opinion
he began to consult his lieutenants asking their advice distrusting his own opinions
he made mistakes blunders and when those were brought to his notice took refuge in bluster
he knew it to be that sooner or later his subordinates would recognise it as such
how long could he maintain his position
so only he could keep his grip upon the lever of control till the battle was over all would be well
if not he would fall and once fallen he knew that now briber that he was he would never rise again
he was on his way at this moment to the city to consult with lyman as to a certain issue of the contest between the railroad and the ranchers which of late had been brought to his notice
when appeal had been taken to the supreme court by the executive committee certain test cases had been chosen which should represent all the lands in question
neither magnus nor annixter had so appealed believing of course that their cases were covered by the test cases on trial at washington
magnus had here blundered again and the agents in san francisco had written to warn him that the railroad might be able to take advantage of a technicality and by pretending that neither quien sabe nor los muertos were included in the appeal attempt to put its dummy buyers in possession of the two ranches before the supreme court handed down its decision
the ninety days allowed for taking this appeal were nearly at an end and after then the railroad could act
osterman and magnus at once decided to go up to the city there joining annixter who had been absent from quien sabe for the last ten days and talk the matter over with lyman
lyman because of his position as commissioner might be cognisant of the plans and at the same time could give sound legal advice as to what was to be done should the new rumour prove true
say remarked osterman as the train pulled out of the bonneville station and the two men settled themselves for the long journey say governor whats all up with buck annixter these days got a bean about something sure had not noticed answered magnus
mr annixter has been away some time lately
i cannot imagine what should keep him so long in san francisco it said osterman winking
have three guesses
guess right and you get a cigar
i guess spells hilma tree
and a little while ago she quit quien sabe and hiked out to frisco
so did buck
do i draw the cigar up to you have noticed her observed magnus fine figure of a woman
she would make some man a good wife
hoh
wife
buck annixter marry
not much gone agirling at last old buck as funny as twins
have to josh him about it when i see him sure
but when osterman and magnus at last fell in with annixter in the vestibule of the lick house on montgomery street nothing could be got out of him
he was in an execrable humour
when magnus had broached the subject of business he had declared that all business could go to pot and when osterman his tongue in his cheek had permitted himself a most distant allusion to a feemale girl annixter had cursed him for a busyface so vociferously and tersely that even osterman was cowed
well insinuated osterman what are you dallying round frisco so much for
cat fur to make kittenbreeches retorted annixter with oracular vagueness
two weeks before this time annixter had come up to the city and had gone at once to a certain hotel on bush street behind the first national bank that he knew was kept by a family connection of the trees
in his conjecture that hilma and her parents would stop here he was right
their names were on the register
ignoring custom annixter marched straight up to their rooms and before he was well aware of it was eating crow before old man tree
hilma and her mother were out at the time
later on mrs tree returned alone leaving hilma to spend the day with one of her cousins who lived far out on stanyan street in a little house facing the park
between annixter and parents a reconciliation had been effected annixter convincing them both of his sincerity in wishing to make hilma his wife
hilma however refused to see him
as soon as she knew he had followed her to san francisco she had been unwilling to return to the hotel and had arranged with her cousin to spend an indefinite time at her house
she was wretchedly unhappy during all this time would not set foot out of doors and cried herself to sleep night after night
she detested the city
already she was miserably homesick for the ranch
she remembered the days she had spent in the little dairyhouse happy in her work making butter and cheese skimming the great pans of milk scouring the copper vessels and vats plunging her arms elbow deep into the white curds coming and going in that atmosphere of freshness cleanliness and sunlight gay singing supremely happy just because the sun shone
she remembered her long walks toward the mission late in the afternoons her excursions for cresses underneath the long trestle the crowing of the cocks the distant whistle of the passing trains the faint sounding of the angelus
she recalled with infinite longing the solitary expanse of the ranches the level reaches between the horizons full of light and silence the heat at noon the cloudless iridescence of the sunrise and sunset
she had been so happy in that life
now all those days were passed
this crude raw city with its crowding houses all of wood and tin its blotting fogs its uproarious trade winds disturbed and saddened her
there was no outlook for the future
at length one day about a week after arrival in the city she was prevailed upon to go for a walk in the park
she went alone putting on for the first time the little hat of black straw with its puff of white silk her mother had bought for her a pink shirtwaist her belt of imitation alligator skin her new skirt of brown cloth and her low shoes set off with their little steel buckles
she found a tiny summer house built in japanese fashion around a diminutive pond and sat there for a while her hands folded in her lap amused with watching the goldfish knew not what
without any warning annixter sat down beside her
she was too frightened to move
she looked at him with wide eyes that began to fill with tears
oh she said at last didnot know
well exclaimed annixter here you are at last been watching that blamed house till i was afraid the policeman would move me on
by the lord he suddenly cried pale
hilma do you feel well am well she faltered
no youre not he declared know better
you are coming back to quien sabe with me
this place donot agree with you
hilma whats all the matter
why havenot you let me see you all this time
do you things are with me
your mother told you didnot she
do you know how sorry i am
do you know that i see now that i made the mistake of my life there that time under the long trestle
i found it out the night after you went away
i sat all night on a stone out on the ranch somewhere and i donot know exactly what happened but been a different man since then
i see things all different now
why only begun to live since then
i know what love means now and instead of being ashamed of it proud of it
if i never was to see you again i would be glad lived through that night just the same
i just woke up that night been absolutely and completely selfish up to the moment i realised i really loved you and now whether youll let me marry you or not i mean to donot know in a different way to live different
i canot make you understand but just loving you has changed my life all around made it easier to do the straight clean thing
i want to do it its fun doing it
remember once i said i was proud of being a hard man a driver of being glad that people hated me and were afraid of me
well since loved you ashamed of it all
i donot want to be hard any more and nobody is going to hate me if i can help it happy and i want other people so
i love you he suddenly exclaimed love you and if you will forgive me and if you will come down to such a beast as i am i want to be to you the best a man can be to a woman hilma
do you understand little girl
i want to be your husband
hilma looked at the goldfishes through her tears
have you got anything to say to me hilma he asked after a while donot know what you want me to say she murmured
yes you do he insisted followed you way up here to hear it waited around in these beastly draughty picnic grounds for over a week to hear it
you know what i want to hear hilma forgive you she hazarded
that will do for a starter he answered
but thats not then i donot know what
shall i say it for you
she hesitated a long minute then you mightnot say it right she replied
trust me for that
shall i say it for you hilma donot know what youll say say what you are thinking of
shall i say it
there was a very long pause
a goldfish rose to the surface of the little pond with a sharp rippling sound
the fog drifted overhead
there was nobody about
no said hilma at length can say it for myself
all at once she turned to him and put her arms around his neck
oh you love me she cried
is it really true
do you mean every word of it
and you are sorry and you be good to me if i will be your wife
you will be my dear dear husband
the tears sprang to eyes
he took her in his arms and held her there for a moment
never in his life had he felt so unworthy so undeserving of this clean pure girl who forgave him and trusted his spoken word and believed him to be the good man he could only wish to be
she was so far above him so exalted so noble that he should have bowed his forehead to her feet and instead she took him in her arms believing him to be good to be her equal
he could think of no words to say
the tears overflowed his eyes and ran down upon his cheeks
she drew away from him and held him a second at arms length looking at him and he saw that she too had been crying think he said we are a couple of softies
no no she insisted want to cry and want you to cry too
oh dear i havenot a handkerchief
here take mine
they wiped each others eyes like two children and for a long time sat in the deserted little japanese pleasure house their arms about each other talking talking talking
on the following saturday they were married in an uptown presbyterian church and spent the week of their honeymoon at a small family hotel on sutter street
as a matter of course they saw the sights of the city together
they made the inevitable bridal trip to the cliff house and spent an afternoon in the grewsome and beauties of gardens they went through chinatown the palace hotel the park hilma resolutely refused to believe in the egyptian they drove out in a hired hack to the presidio and the golden gate
on the sixth day of their excursions hilma abruptly declared they had had enough of playing out and must be serious and get to work
this work was nothing less than the buying of the furniture and appointments for the rejuvenated ranch house at quien sabe where they were to live
annixter had telegraphed to his overseer to have the building repainted replastered and reshingled and to empty the rooms of everything but the telephone and safe
he also sent instructions to have the dimensions of each room noted down and the result forwarded to him
it was the arrival of these memoranda that had roused hilma to action
then ensued a most delicious week
armed with formidable lists written by annixter on hotel envelopes they two descended upon the department stores of the city the carpet stores the furniture stores
right and left they bought and bargained sending each consignment as soon as purchased to quien sabe
nearly an entire car load of carpets curtains kitchen furniture pictures fixtures lamps straw matting chairs and the like were sent down to the ranch annixter making a point that their new home should be entirely equipped by san francisco dealers
the furnishings of the bedroom and sittingroom were left to the very last
for the former hilma bought a set of pure white enamel three chairs a washstand and bureau a marvellous bargain of thirty dollars discovered by wonderful accident at a friday sale
the bed was a piece by itself bought elsewhere but none the less a wonder
it was of brass very brave and gay and actually boasted a canopy
they bought it complete just as it stood in the window of the department store and hilma was in an ecstasy over its crisp clean muslin curtains spread and shams
never was there such a bed the luxury of a princess such a bed as she had dreamed about her whole life
next the appointments of the sittingroom occupied annixter himself bewildered by this astonishing display unable to offer a single suggestion himself merely approved of all she bought
in the sittingroom was to be a beautiful blue and white paper cool straw matting set off with white wool rugs a stand of flowers in the window a globe of goldfish rocking chairs a sewing machine and a great round centre table of yellow oak whereon should stand a lamp covered with a deep shade of crinkly red tissue paper
on the walls were to hang several affairs photographs from life all properly choir boys in robes with beautiful eyes pensive young girls in pink gowns with flowing yellow hair drooping over golden harps a coloured reproduction of rouget de lisle singing the marseillaise and two pieces of wood carving representing a quail and a wild duck hung by one leg in the midst of game bags and powder masterpieces both
at last everything had been bought all arrangements made trunks packed with her new dresses and the tickets to bonneville bought go by the overland by jingo declared annixter across the table to his wife at their last meal in the hotel where they had been stopping no way trains or locals for us hey
but we reach bonneville at an hour protested hilma
five in the morning
never mind he declared go home in hilma not going to have any of those slobs in bonneville say i didnot know how to do the thing in style and well have vacca meet us with the team
no sir it is or nothing
when it comes to buying furniture i donot shine perhaps but i know whats due my wife
he was obdurate and late one afternoon the couple boarded the transcontinental the crack overland flyer of the pacific and southwestern at the oakland mole
only parents were there to say goodbye
annixter knew that magnus and osterman were in the city but he had laid his plans to elude them
magnus he could trust to be dignified but that goat osterman one could never tell what he would do next
he did not propose to start his journey home in a shower of rice
annixter marched down the line of cars his hands encumbered with wicker telescope baskets satchels and valises his tickets in his mouth his hat on wrong side foremost hilma and her parents hurrying on behind him trying to keep up
annixter was in a turmoil of nerves lest something should go wrong catching a train was always for him a little crisis
he rushed ahead so furiously that when he had found his pullman he had lost his party
he set down his valises to mark the place and charged back along the platform waving his arms
come on he cried when at length he espied the others no more time
he shouldered and urged them forward to where he had set his valises only to find one of them gone
instantly he raised an outcry
aha a fine way to treat passengers
there was and management for you
he would by the lord he the porter appeared in the vestibule of the car to placate him
he had already taken his valises inside
annixter would not permit parents to board the car declaring that the train might pull out any moment
so he and his wife following the porter down the narrow passage by the stateroom took their places and raising the window leaned out to say goodbye to mr and mrs tree
these latter would not return to quien sabe
old man tree had found a business chance awaiting him in the matter of supplying his relatives hotel with dairy products
but bonneville was not too far from san francisco the separation was by no means final
the porters began taking up the steps that stood by the vestibule of each sleepingcar
well have a good time daughter observed her father and come up to see us whenever you can
from beyond the enclosure of the depots reverberating roof came the measured clang of a bell guess were off cried annixter
mrs tree
remember your promise hilma her mother hastened to exclaim to write every sunday afternoon
there came a prolonged creaking and groan of straining wood and iron work all along the length of the train
they all began to cry their goodbyes at once
the train stirred moved forward and gathering slow headway rolled slowly out into the sunlight
hilma leaned out of the window and as long as she could keep her mother in sight waved her handkerchief
then at length she sat back in her seat and looked at her husband
well she said
well echoed annixter happy for the tears rose in her eyes
she nodded energetically smiling at him bravely
you look a little pale he declared frowning uneasily feel well
pretty well
promptly he was seized with uneasiness
but not well hey
is that it
it was true that hilma had felt a faint tremour of seasickness on the ferryboat coming from the city to the oakland mole
no doubt a little nausea yet remained with her
but annixter refused to accept this explanation
he was distressed beyond expression
now youre going to be sick he cried anxiously
no no she protested not a bit
but you said you didnot feel very well
where is it you feel sick donot know not sick
oh dear me why will you bother
headache
not the least
you feel tired then it
no wonder the way rushed you round today
dear tired and sick and all no no i can tell
i think wed best have the berth made up and you lie down
that would be perfectly ridiculous
well where is it you feel sick
show me put your hand on the place
want to eat something
with elaborate minuteness he crossquestioned her refusing to let the subject drop protesting that she had dark circles under her eyes that she had grown thinner
wonder if theres a doctor on board he murmured looking uncertainly about the car
let me see your tongue
i little whiskey is what you want that and some pru no no she exclaimed as well as i ever was in all my life
look at me
now tell me do look likee a sick lady
he scrutinised her face distressfully
now donot i look the picture of health she challenged
in a way you do he began and then again hilma beat a tattoo with her heels upon the floor shutting her fists the thumbs tucked inside
she closed her eyes shaking her head energetically wonot listen i wonot listen i wonot listen she cried
but just the same she mocked wonot listen i wonot listen
she put a hand over his mouth
look heres the diningcar waiter and the first call for supper and your wife is hungry
they went forward and had supper in the diner while the long train now out upon the main line settled itself to its pace the prolonged even gallop that it would hold for the better part of the week spinning out the miles as a cotton spinner spins thread
it was already dark when antioch was left behind
abruptly the sunset appeared to wheel in the sky and readjusted itself to the right of the track behind mount diablo here visible almost to its base
the train had turned southward
neroly was passed then brentwood then byron
in the gathering dusk mountains began to build themselves up on either hand far off blocking the horizon
the train shot forward roaring
between the mountains the land lay level cut up into farms ranches
these continually grew larger growing wheat began to appear billowing in the wind of the trains passage
the mountains grew higher the land richer and by the time the moon rose the train was well into the northernmost limits of the valley of the san joaquin
annixter had engaged an entire section and after he and his wife went to bed had the porter close the upper berth
hilma sat up in bed to say her prayers both hands over her face and then kissing annixter goodnight went to sleep with the directness of a little child holding his hand in both her own
annixter who never could sleep on the train dozed and tossed and fretted for hours consulting his watch and timetable whenever there was a stop twice he rose to get a drink of ice water and between whiles was forever sitting up in the narrow berth stretching himself and yawning murmuring with uncertain relevance oh lord
there were some dozen other passengers in the lady with three children a group of schoolteachers a couple of drummers a stout gentleman with whiskers and a welldressed young man in a plaid travelling cap whom annixter had observed before supper time reading tartarin in the french
but by nine oclock all these people were in their berths
occasionally above the rhythmic rumble of the wheels annixter could hear one of the ladys children fidgeting and complaining
the stout gentleman snored monotonously in two notes one a rasping bass the other a prolonged treble
at intervals a brakeman or the passenger conductor pushed down the aisle between the curtains his red and white lamp over his arm
looking out into the car annixter saw in an end section where the berths had not been made up the porter in his white duck coat dozing his mouth wide open his head on his shoulder
the hours passed
midnight came and went
annixter checking off the stations noted their passage of modesto merced and madeira
then after another broken nap he lost count
he wondered where they were
had they reached fresno yet
raising the window curtain he made a shade with both hands on either side of his face and looked out
the night was thick dark clouded over
a fine rain was falling leaving horizontal streaks on the glass of the outside window
only the faintest grey blur indicated the sky
everything else was impenetrable blackness think sure we must have passed fresno he muttered
he looked at his watch
it was about halfpast three
if we have passed fresno he said to himself better wake the little girl pretty soon need about an hour to dress
better find out for sure
he drew on his trousers and shoes got into his coat and stepped out into the aisle
in the seat that had been occupied by the porter the pullman conductor his cash box and carschedules before him was checking up his berths a blue pencil behind his ear the next stop captain inquired annixter coming up
have we reached fresno yet
just passed it the other responded looking at annixter over his spectacles the next stop
goshen
we will be there in about fortyfive minutes
fair black night isnot it
black as a pocket see youre the party in upper and lower annixter caught at the back of the nearest seat just in time to prevent a fall and the conductors cash box was shunted off the surface of the plush seat and came clanking to the floor
the pintsch lights overhead vibrated with blinding rapidity in the long sliding jar that ran through the train from end to end and the momentum of its speed suddenly decreasing all but pitched the conductor from his seat
a hideous earsplitting rasp made itself heard from the clampeddown westinghouse gear underneath and annixter knew that the wheels had ceased to revolve and that the train was sliding forward upon the motionless flanges
hello hello he exclaimed all up now
emergency brakes declared the conductor catching up his cash box and thrusting his papers and tickets into it
nothing much probably a cow on the track
he disappeared carrying his lantern with him
but the other passengers all but the stout gentleman were awake heads were thrust from out the curtains and annixter hurrying back to hilma was assailed by all manner of questions
what was that
anything wrong up anyways
hilma was just waking as annixter pushed the curtain aside
oh i was so frightened the matter dear she exclaimed donot know he answered
only the emergency brakes
just a cow on the track i guess get scared
it isnot anything
but with a final shriek of the westinghouse appliance the train came to a definite halt
at once the silence was absolute
the ears still numb with the longcontinued roar of wheels and clashing iron at first refused to register correctly the smaller noises of the surroundings
voices came from the other end of the car strange and unfamiliar as though heard at a great distance across the water
the stillness of the night outside was so profound that the rain dripping from the car roof upon the roadbed underneath was as distinct as the ticking of a clock
well weve sure stopped observed one of the drummers
what is it asked hilma again
are you sure theres nothing wrong
sure said annixter
outside underneath their window they heard the sound of hurried footsteps crushing into the clinkers by the side of the ties
they passed on and annixter heard some one in the distance shout yes on the other side
then the door at the end of their car opened and a brakeman with a red beard ran down the aisle and out upon the platform in front
the forward door closed
everything was quiet again
in the stillness the fat gentlemans snores made themselves heard once more
the minutes passed nothing stirred
there was no sound but the dripping rain
the line of cars lay immobilised and inert under the night
one of the drummers having stepped outside on the platform for a look around returned saying there sure isnot any station anywheres about and no siding
bet you they have had an accident of some kind
ask the porter did
he donot know
maybe they stopped to take on wood or water or something
well they wouldnot use the emergency brakes for that would they
why this train stopped almost in her own length
pretty near slung me out the berth
those were the emergency brakes
i heard some one say so
from far out towards the front of the train near the locomotive came the sharp incisive report of a revolver then two more almost simultaneously then after a long interval a fourth
say thats by god boys theyre shooting
say this is a holdup
instantly a whitehot excitement flared from end to end of the car
incredibly sinister heard thus in the night and in the rain mysterious fearful those four pistol shots started confusion from out the sense of security like a frightened rabbit hunted from her burrow the passengers of the car looked into each others faces
it had come to them at last this they had so often read about
now they were to see the real thing now they were to face actuality face this danger of the night leaping in from out the blackness of the roadside masked armed ready to kill
they were facing it now
they were held up
hilma said nothing only catching hand looking squarely into his eyes
steady little girl he said
they canot hurt you
i wonot leave you
by the lord he suddenly exclaimed his excitement getting the better of him for a moment
by the lord its a holdup
the schoolteachers were in the aisle of the car in night gown wrapper and dressing sack huddled together like sheep holding on to each other looking to the men silently appealing for protection
two of them were weeping white to the lips
oh oh oh its terrible
oh if they only wonot hurt me
but the lady with the children looked out from her berth smiled reassuringly and said not a bit frightened
they wonot do anything to us if we keep quiet my watch and jewelry all ready for them in my little black bag see
she exhibited it to the passengers
her children were all awake
they were quiet looking about them with eager faces interested and amused at this surprise
in his berth the fat gentleman with whiskers snored profoundly
say going out there suddenly declared one of the drummers flourishing a pocket revolver
his friend caught his arm make a fool of yourself max he said
they wonot come near us observed the welldressed young man they are after the wellsfargo box and the registered mail
you wonot do any good out there
but the other loudly protested
no he was going out
he didnot propose to be buncoed without a fight
he wasnot any coward
well you donot go thats all said his friend angrily women and children in this car
you ainot going to draw the fire here
well thats to be thought of said the other allowing himself to be pacified but still holding his pistol let him open that window cried annixter sharply from his place by side for the drummer had made as if to open the sash in one of the sections that had not been made up
sure thats right said the others open any windows
keep your head in get us all shot if you arenot careful
however the drummer had got the window up and had leaned out before the others could interfere and draw him away
say by jove he shouted as he turned back to the car our engines gone standing on a curve and you can see the end of the train gone i tell you
well look for yourself
in spite of their precautions one after another his friends looked out
sure enough the train was without a locomotive done it so we canot get away vociferated the drummer with the pistol
now by theyll come through the cars and stand us up be in here in a minute
from far away up the track apparently some halfmile ahead of the train came the sound of a heavy explosion
the windows of the car vibrated with it
shooting again
that isnot shooting exclaimed annixter pulled the express and mail car on ahead with the engine and now they are dynamiting her open
that must be it
yes sure thats just what they are doing
the forward door of the car opened and closed and the schoolteachers shrieked and cowered
the drummer with the revolver faced about his eyes bulging
however it was only the train conductor hatless his lantern in his hand
he was soaked with rain
he appeared in the aisle
is there a doctor in this car he asked
promptly the passengers surrounded him voluble with questions
but he was in a bad temper donot know anything more than you he shouted angrily
it was a holdup
i guess you know that donot you
well what more do you want to know
i ainot got time to fool around
they cut off our express car and have cracked it open and they shot one of our train crew thats all and i want a doctor
did they shoot him do you mean
is he hurt bad
did the men get away
oh shut up will you all exclaimed the conductor
what do i know
is there a in this car thats what i want to know
the welldressed young man stepped forward a doctor he said
well come along then returned the conductor in a surly voice and the passengers in this car he added turning back at the door and nodding his head menacingly will go back to bed and there all over and theres nothing to see
he went out followed by the young doctor
then ensued an interminable period of silence
the entire train seemed deserted
helpless bereft of its engine a huge decapitated monster it lay halfway around a curve rained upon abandoned
there was more fear in this last condition of affairs more terror in the idea of this prolonged line of sleepers with their nickelled fittings their plate glass their upholstery vestibules and the like loaded down with people lost and forgotten in the night and the rain than there had been when the actual danger threatened
what was to become of them now
who was there to help them
their engine was gone they were helpless
what next was to happen
nobody came near the car
even the porter had disappeared
the wait seemed endless and the persistent snoring of the whiskered gentleman rasped the nerves like the scrape of a file
well how long are we going to stick here now began one of the drummers
wonder if they hurt the engine with their dynamite
oh i know they will come through the car and rob us wailed the schoolteachers
the lady with the little children went back to bed and annixter assured that the trouble was over did likewise
but nobody slept
from berth to berth came the sound of suppressed voices talking it all over formulating conjectures
certain points seemed to be settled upon no one knew how as indisputable
the highwaymen had been four in number and had stopped the train by pulling the bell cord
a brakeman had attempted to interfere and had been shot
the robbers had been on the train all the way from san francisco
the drummer named max remembered to have seen four characters in the smokingcar at lathrop and had intended to speak to the conductor about them
this drummer had been in a holdup before and told the story of it over and over again
at last after what seemed to have been an hours delay and when the dawn had already begun to show in the east the locomotive backed on to the train again with a reverberating jar that ran from car to car
at the jolting the schoolteachers screamed in chorus and the whiskered gentleman stopped snoring and thrust his head from his curtains blinking at the pintsch lights
it appeared that he was an englishman say he asked of the drummer named max say my friend what place is this
the others roared with derision
we were sir thats what we were
we were held up and you slept through it all
you missed the show of your life
the gentleman fixed the group with a prolonged gaze
he said never a word but little by little he was convinced that the drummers told the truth
all at once he grew wrathful his face purpling
he withdrew his head angrily buttoning his curtains together in a fury
the cause of his rage was inexplicable but they could hear him resettling himself upon his pillows with exasperated movements of his head and shoulders
in a few moments the deep bass and shrill treble of his snoring once more sounded through the car
at last the train got under way again with useless warning blasts of the engines whistle
in a few moments it was tearing away through the dawn at a wonderful speed rocking around curves roaring across culverts making up time
and all the rest of that strange night the passengers sitting up in their unmade beds in the swaying car lighted by a strange mingling of pallid dawn and trembling pintsch lights rushing at breakneck speed through the misty rain were oppressed by a vision of figures of terror far behind them in the night they had left masked armed galloping toward the mountains pistol in hand the booty bound to the saddle bow galloping galloping on sending a thrill of fear through all the country side
the young doctor returned
he sat down in the smokingroom lighting a cigarette and annixter and the drummers pressed around him to know the story of the whole affair
the man is dead he declared the brakeman
he was shot through the lungs twice
they think the fellow got away with about five thousand in gold coin
the fellow there four of them
no only one
and say let me tell you he had his nerve with him
it seems he was on the roof of the express car all the time and going as fast as we were he jumped from the roof of the car down on to the coal on the engines tender and crawled over that and held up the men in the cab with his gun took their guns from em and made em stop the train
even ordered em to use the emergency gear seems he knew all about it
then he went back and uncoupled the express car himself
while he was doing this a remember that brakeman that came through here once or a red mustache chap
sure
well as soon as the train stopped this brakeman guessed something was wrong and ran up saw the fellow cutting off the express car and took a couple of shots at him and the fireman says the fellow didnot even take his hand off the couplingpin just turned around as cool as and the brakeman right there
they werenot five feet apart when they began shooting
the brakeman had come on him unexpected had no idea he was so close
and the express messenger all this time
well he did his best
jumped out with his repeating shotgun but the fellow had him covered before he could turn round
held him up and took his gun away from him
say you know i call that nerve just the same
one man standing up a whole trainload like that
then as soon as hed cut the express car off he made the engineer run her up the track about half a mile to a road crossing a what do you think of that he have it all figured out close
and when he got there he dynamited the safe and got the wellsfargo box
he took five thousand in gold coin the messenger says it was railroad money that the company were sending down to bakersfield to pay off with
it was in a bag
he never touched the registered mail nor a whole wad of greenbacks that were in the safe but just took the coin got on his horse and lit out
the engineer says he went to the eastard
he got away did he
yes but they think theyll get him
he wore a kind of mask but the brakeman recognised him positively
we got his antemortem statement
the brakeman said the fellow had a grudge against the road
he was a discharged employee and lives near bonneville
dyke by the lord exclaimed annixter the name said the young doctor
when the train arrived at bonneville forty minutes behind time it landed annixter and hilma in the midst of the very thing they most wished to enormous crowd
the news that the overland had been held up thirty miles south of fresno a brakeman killed and the safe looted and that dyke alone was responsible for the nights work had been wired on ahead from fowler the train conductor throwing the despatch to the station agent from the flying train
before the train had come to a standstill under the arched roof of the bonneville depot it was all but taken by assault
annixter with hilma on his arm had almost to fight his way out of the car
the depot was black with people
behrman was there delaney cyrus ruggles the town marshal the mayor
genslinger his hat on the back of his head ranged the train from cab to rearlights notebook in hand interviewing questioning collecting facts for his extra
as annixter descended finally to the platform the editor alert as a terrier his thin osseous hands quivering with eagerness his brown dry face working with excitement caught his elbow
can i have your version of the affair mr annixter
annixter turned on him abruptly
yes he exclaimed fiercely
you and your gang drove dyke from his job because he wouldnot work for starvation wages
then you raised freight rates on him and robbed him of all he had
you ruined him and drove him to fill himself up with whiskey only taken back what you plundered him of and now youre going to hound him over the state hunt him down like a wild animal and bring him to the gallows at san quentin my version of the affair mister genslinger but its worth your subsidy from the and to print it
there was a murmur of approval from the crowd that stood around and genslinger with an angry shrug of one shoulder took himself away
at length annixter brought hilma through the crowd to where young vacca was waiting with the team
however they could not at once start for the ranch annixter wishing to ask some questions at the freight office about a final consignment of chairs
it was nearly eleven oclock before they could start home
but to gain the upper road to quien sabe it was necessary to traverse all of main street running through the heart of bonneville
the entire town seemed to be upon the sidewalks
by now the rain was over and the sun shining
the story of the work of a man whom every one knew and in every mouth
how had dyke come to do it
who would have believed it of him
think of his poor mother and the little tad
well after all he was not so much to blame the railroad people had brought it on themselves
but he had shot a man to death
ah that was a serious business big broadshouldered jovial dyke the man they knew with whom they had shaken hands only yesterday yes and drank with him
he had shot a man killed him had stood there in the dark and in the rain while they were asleep in their beds and had killed a man
now where was he
instinctively eyes were turned eastward over the tops of the houses or down vistas of side streets to where the foothills of the mountains rose dim and vast over the edge of the valley
he was in amongst them somewhere in all that pile of blue crests and purple canyons he was hidden away
now for weeks of searching false alarms clews trailings watchings all the thrill and heartbursting excitement of a manhunt
would he get away
hardly a man on the sidewalks of the town that day who did not hope for it
as team trotted through the central portion of the town young vacca pointed to a denser and larger crowd around the rear entrance of the city hall
fully twenty saddle horses were tied to the iron rail underneath the scant halfgrown trees near by and as annixter and hilma drove by the crowd parted and a dozen men with revolvers on their hips pushed their way to the curbstone and mounting their horses rode away at a gallop the posse said young vacca
outside the town limits the ground was level
there was nothing to obstruct the view and to the north in the direction of ranch vacca made out another party of horsemen galloping eastward and beyond these still another the other posses he announced
that further one is archie the sheriff
he came down from visalia on a special engine this morning
when the team turned into the driveway to the ranch house hilma uttered a little cry clasping her hands joyfully
the house was one glitter of new white paint the driveway had been freshly gravelled the flowerbeds replenished
mrs vacca and her daughter who had been busy putting on the finishing touches came to the door to welcome them this case here asked annixter when after helping his wife from the carryall his eye fell upon a wooden box of some three by five feet that stood on the porch and bore the red wellsfargo label
it came here last night addressed to you sir exclaimed mrs vacca
we were sure it wasnot any of your furniture so we didnot open it
oh maybe its a wedding present exclaimed hilma her eyes sparkling
well maybe it is returned her husband
here m son help me in with this
annixter and young vacca bore the case into the sittingroom of the house and annixter hammer in hand attacked it vigorously
vacca discreetly withdrew on signal from his mother closing the door after him
annixter and his wife were left alone
oh hurry hurry cried hilma dancing around him want to see what it is
who do you suppose could have sent it to us
and so heavy too
what do you think it can be
annixter put the claw of the hammer underneath the edge of the board top and wrenched with all his might
the boards had been clamped together by a transverse bar and the whole top of the box came away in one piece
a layer of excelsior was disclosed and on it a letter addressed by typewriter to annixter
it bore the trademark of a business firm of los angeles
annixter glanced at this and promptly caught it up before hilma could see with an exclamation of intelligence
oh i know what this is he observed carelessly trying to restrain her busy hands
it isnot anything
just some machinery
let it go
but already she had pulled away the excelsior
underneath in temporary racks were two dozen winchester repeating rifles murmured hilma blankly
well i told you not to mind said annixter
it isnot anything look through the rooms
but you said you knew what it was she protested bewildered
you wanted to make believe it was machinery
are you keeping anything from me
tell me what it all means
oh why are you gettingthese
she caught his arm looking with intense eagerness into his face
she half understood already
annixter saw that
well he said lamely may not come to anything at all but you knowwell this league of the railroad tries to jump quien sabe or los muertos or any of the other made up our leaguers we wouldnot let it all
and i thought cried hilma drawing back fearfully from the case of rifles and i thought it was a wedding present
and that was their homecoming the end of their bridal trip
through the terror of the night echoing with pistol shots through that scene of robbery and murder into this atmosphere of alarms a manhunt organising armed horsemen silhouetted against the horizons cases of rifles where wedding presents should have been annixter brought his young wife to be mistress of a home he might at any moment be called upon to defend with his life
the days passed
soon a week had gone by
magnus derrick and osterman returned from the city without any definite idea as to the plans
lyman had been reticent
he knew nothing as to the progress of the land cases in washington
there was no news
the executive committee of the league held a perfunctory meeting at los muertos at which nothing but routine business was transacted
a scheme put forward by osterman for a conference with the railroad managers fell through because of the refusal of the company to treat with the ranchers upon any other basis than that of the new grading
it was impossible to learn whether or not the company considered los muertos quien sabe and the ranches around bonneville covered by the test cases then on appeal
meanwhile there was no decrease in the excitement that holdup had set loose over all the county
day after day it was the one topic of conversation at street corners at crossroads over dinner tables in office bank and store
behrman placarded the town with a notice of reward for the capture dead or alive and the express company supplemented this by another offer of an equal amount
the country was thick with parties of horsemen armed with rifles and revolvers recruited from visalia goshen and the few railroad sympathisers around bonneville and guadlajara
one after another of these returned emptyhanded covered with dust and mud their horses exhausted to be met and passed by fresh posses starting out to continue the pursuit
the sheriff of santa clara county sent down his bloodhounds from san harmlesslooking dogs with a terrific help in the chase
reporters from the san francisco papers appeared interviewing every one sometimes even accompanying the searching bands
horse hoofs clattered over the roads at night bells were rung the mercury issued extra after extra the bloodhounds bayed gun butts clashed on the asphalt pavements of bonneville accidental discharges of revolvers brought the whole town into the street farm hands called to each other across the fences of a word the countryside was in an uproar
and all to no effect
the hoofmarks of horse had been traced in the mud of the road to within a quarter of a mile of the foothills and there irretrievably lost
three days after the holdup a sheepherder was found who had seen the highwayman on a ridge in the higher mountains to the northeast of taurusa
and that was absolutely all
rumours were thick promising clews were discovered new trails taken up but nothing transpired to bring the pursuers and pursued any closer together
then after ten days of strain public interest began to flag
it was believed that dyke had succeeded in getting away
if this was true he had gone to the southward after gaining the mountains and it would be his intention to work out of the range somewhere near the southern part of the san joaquin near bakersfield
thus the sheriffs marshals and deputies decided
they had hunted too many criminals in these mountains before not to know the usual courses taken
in time dyke come out of the mountains to get water and provisions
but this time passed and from not one of the watched points came any word of his appearance
at last the posses began to disband
little by little the pursuit was given up
only behrman persisted
he had made up his mind to bring dyke in
he succeeded in arousing the same degree of determination in now a trusted aide of the of his own cousin a real estate broker named christian who knew the mountains and had once been marshal of visalia in the old stockraising days
these two went into the sierras accompanied by two hired deputies and carrying with them a months provisions and two of the bloodhounds loaned by the santa clara sheriff
on a certain sunday a few days after the departure of christian and delaney annixter who had been reading david copperfield in his hammock on the porch of the ranch house put down the book and went to find hilma who was helping louisa vacca set the table for dinner
he found her in the diningroom her hands full of the goldbordered china plates only used on special occasions and which louisa was forbidden to touch
his wife was more than ordinarily pretty that day
she wore a dress of flowered organdie over pink sateen with pink ribbons about her waist and neck and on her slim feet the low shoes she always affected with their smart bright buckles
her thick brown sweetsmelling hair was heaped high upon her head and set off with a bow of black velvet and underneath the shadow of its coils her wideopen eyes rimmed with the thin black line of her lashes shone continually reflecting the sunlight
marriage had only accentuated the beautiful maturity of no longer the single deep swell from her throat to her waist the strong fine amplitude of her hips the sweet feminine undulation of her neck and shoulders
her cheeks were pink with health and her large round arms carried the piledup dishes with never a tremour
annixter observant enough where his wife was concerned noted how the reflection of the white china set a glow of pale light underneath her chin
hilma he said been wondering lately about things so blamed happy ourselves it wonot do for us to forget about other people who are down will it
might change our luck
and just likely to forget that way too my nature
his wife looked up at him joyfully
here was the new annixter certainly
in all this hullabaloo about dyke he went on some one nobody ainot thought about at all the little tad
i wouldnot be surprised if they were in a hole over there
what do you say we drive over to the hop ranch after dinner and see if she wants anything
hilma put down the plates and came around the table and kissed him without a word
as soon as their dinner was over annixter had the carryall hitched up and dispensing with young vacca drove over to the hop ranch with hilma
hilma could not keep back the tears as they passed through the lamentable desolation of the withered brown vines symbols of perished hopes and abandoned effort and annixter swore between his teeth
though the wheels of the carryall grated loudly on the roadway in front of the house nobody came to the door nor looked from the windows
the place seemed tenantless infinitely lonely infinitely sad
annixter tied the team and with hilma approached the wideopen door scuffling and tramping on the porch to attract attention
nobody stirred
a sunday stillness pervaded the place
outside the withered hopleaves rustled like dry paper in the breeze
the quiet was ominous
they peered into the front room from the doorway hilma holding her husbands hand
mrs dyke was there
she sat at the table in the middle of the room her head with its white hair down upon her arm
a clutter of unwashed dishes were strewed over the red and white tablecloth
the unkempt room once a marvel of neatness had not been cleaned for days
newspapers extras and copies of san francisco and los angeles dailies were scattered all over the room
on the table itself were crumpled yellow telegrams a dozen of them a score of them blowing about in the draught from the door
and in the midst of all this disarray surrounded by the published accounts of her sons crime the telegraphed answers to her pitiful appeals for tidings fluttering about her head the highwaymans mother worn out abandoned and forgotten slept through the stillness of the sunday afternoon
neither hilma nor annixter ever forgot their interview with mrs dyke that day
suddenly waking she had caught sight of annixter and at once exclaimed eagerly is there any news
for a long time afterwards nothing could be got from her
she was numb to all other issues than the one question of capture
she did not answer their questions nor reply to their offers of assistance
hilma and annixter conferred together without lowering their voices at her very elbow while she looked vacantly at the floor drawing one hand over the other in a persistent maniacal gesture
from time to time she would start suddenly from her chair her eyes wide and as if all at once realising presence would cry out is there any news
where is sidney mrs dyke asked hilma for the fourth time
is she well
is she taken care of the last telegram said mrs dyke in a loud monotonous voice
see it says there is no news
he didnot do it she moaned rocking herself back and forth drawing one hand over the other he didnot do it he didnot do it he didnot do it
i donot know where he is
when at last she came to herself it was with a flood of tears
hilma put her arms around the poor old woman as she bowed herself again upon the table sobbing and weeping
oh my son my son she cried my own boy my only son
if i could have died for you to have prevented this
i remember him when he was little
such a splendid little fellow so brave so loving with never an unkind thought never a mean action
so it was all his life
we were never apart
it was always dear little son and dear mammy between once was he unkind and he loved me and was the gentlest son to me
and he was a man
he is now he is now
they donot understand him
they are not even sure that he did this
he never meant it
they donot know my son
why he wouldnot have hurt a kitten
everybody loved him
he was driven to it
they hounded him down they wouldnot let him alone
he was not right in his mind
they hounded him to it she cried fiercely they hounded him to it
they drove him and goaded him till he couldnot stand it any longer and now they mean to kill him for turning on them
they are hunting him with dogs night after night i have stood on the porch and heard the dogs baying far off
they are tracking my boy with dogs like a wild animal
may god never forgive them
she rose to her feet terrible her white hair unbound
may god punish them as they deserve may they never my knees i shall pray for it every their money be a curse to them may their sons their firstborn only sons be taken from them in their youth
but hilma interrupted begging her to be silent to be quiet
the tears came again then and the choking sobs
hilma took her in her arms
oh my little boy my little boy she cried
my only son all that i had to have come to this
he was not right in his mind or he would have known it would break my heart
oh my son my son if i could have died for you
sidney came in clinging to her dress weeping imploring her not to cry protesting that they never could catch her papa that he would come back soon
hilma took them both the little child and the brokendown old woman in the great embrace of her strong arms and they all three sobbed together
annixter stood on the porch outside his back turned looking straight before him into the wilderness of dead vines his teeth shut hard his lower lip thrust out hope behrman is satisfied with all this he muttered hope he is satisfied now damn his soul
all at once an idea occurred to him
he turned about and reentered the room
mrs dyke he began want you and sidney to come over and live at quien sabe
i canot make me believe that the reporters and officers and officious busyfaces that pretend to offer help just so as they can satisfy their curiosity arenot nagging you to death
i want you to let me take care of you and the little tad till all this trouble of yours is over with plenty of place for you
you can have the house my wifes people used to live in got to look these things in the face
what are you going to do to get along
you must be very short of money
behrman will foreclose on you and take the whole place in a little while now
i want you to let me help you let hilma and me be good friends to you
it would be a privilege
mrs dyke tried bravely to assume her pride insisting that she could manage but her spirit was broken
the whole affair ended unexpectedly with annixter and hilma bringing mother and little girl back to quien sabe in the carryall
mrs dyke would not take with her a stick of furniture nor a single ornament
it would only serve to remind her of a vanished happiness
she packed a few clothes of her own and in a little trunk hilma helping her and annixter stowed the trunk under the back seat
mrs dyke turned the key in the door of the house and annixter helped her to her seat beside his wife
they drove through the sear brown hop vines
at the angle of the road mrs dyke turned around and looked back at the ruin of the hop ranch the roof of the house just showing above the trees
she never saw it again
as soon as annixter and hilma were alone after their return to quien sabemrs
dyke and sidney having been installed in the trees old threw her arms around her husbands neck
fine she exclaimed oh it was fine of you dear to think of them and to be so good to them
my husband is such a man
so unselfish
you wouldnot have thought of being kind to mrs dyke and sidney a little while ago you wouldnot have thought of them at all
but you did now and its just because you love me true isnot it it
and because its made you a better man so proud and glad to think its so
it is so isnot it
just because you love me true
you bet it is hilma he told her
as hilma and annixter were sitting down to the supper which they found waiting for them louisa vacca came to the door of the diningroom to say that harran derrick had telephoned over from los muertos for annixter and had left word for him to ring up los muertos as soon as he came in
he said it was important added louisa vacca
maybe they have news from washington suggested hilma
annixter would not wait to have supper but telephoned to los muertos at once
magnus answered the call
there was a special meeting of the executive committee of the league summoned for the next day he told annixter
it was for the purpose of considering the new grain tariff prepared by the railroad commissioners
lyman had written that the schedule of this tariff had just been issued that he had not been able to construct it precisely according to the wheatgrowers wishes and that he himself would come down to los muertos and explain its apparent discrepancies
magnus said lyman would be present at the session
annixter curious for details forbore nevertheless to question
the connection from los muertos to quien sabe was made through bonneville and in those troublesome times no one could be trusted
it could not be known who would overhear conversations carried on over the lines
he assured magnus that he would be on hand
the time for the committee meeting had been set for seven oclock in the evening in order to accommodate lyman who wrote that he would be down on the evening train but would be compelled by pressure of business to return to the city early the next morning
at the time appointed the men composing the committee gathered about the table in the diningroom of the los muertos ranch house
it was almost a reproduction of the scene of the famous evening when osterman had proposed the plan of the ranchers railroad commission
magnus derrick sat at the head of the table in his buttoned frock coat
whiskey bottles and siphons of sodawater were within easy reach
presley who by now was considered the confidential friend of every member of the committee lounged as before on the sofa smoking cigarettes the cat nathalie on his knee
besides magnus and annixter osterman was present and old broderson and harran garnet from the ruby rancho and gethings of the san pablo who were also members of the executive committee were on hand preoccupied bearded men smoking black cigars and last of all dabney the silent old man of whom little was known but his name and who had been made a member of the committee nobody could tell why
my son lyman should be here gentlemen within at least ten minutes
i have sent my team to meet him at bonneville explained magnus as he called the meeting to order
the secretary will call the roll
osterman called the roll and to fill in the time read over the minutes of the previous meeting
the treasurer was making his report as to the funds at the disposal of the league when lyman arrived
magnus and harran went forward to meet him and the committee rather awkwardly rose and remained standing while the three exchanged greetings the members some of whom had never seen their commissioner eyeing him out of the corners of their eyes
lyman was dressed with his usual correctness
his cravat was of the latest fashion his clothes of careful design and unimpeachable fit
his shoes of patent leather reflected the lamplight and he carried a drab overcoat over his arm
before being introduced to the committee he excused himself a moment and ran to see his mother who waited for him in the adjoining sittingroom
but in a few moments he returned asking pardon for the delay
he was all affability his protruding eyes that gave such an unusual foreign appearance to his very dark face radiated geniality
he was evidently anxious to please to produce a good impression upon the grave clumsy farmers before whom he stood
but at the same time presley watching him from his place on the sofa could imagine that he was rather nervous
he was too nimble in his cordiality and the little gestures he made in bringing his cuffs into view and in touching the ends of his tight black mustache with the ball of his thumb were repeated with unnecessary frequency
mr broderson my son lyman my eldest son
mr annixter my son lyman
the governor introduced him to the ranchers proud of good looks his correct dress his ease of manner
lyman shook hands all around keeping up a flow of small talk finding a new phrase for each member complimenting osterman whom he already knew upon his talent for organisation recalling a mutual acquaintance to the mind of old broderson
at length however he sat down at the end of the table opposite his brother
there was a silence
magnus rose to recapitulate the reasons for the extra session of the committee stating again that the board of railway commissioners which succeeded in seating had at length issued the new schedule of reduced rates and that mr derrick had been obliging enough to offer to come down to los muertos in person to acquaint the wheatgrowers of the san joaquin with the new rates for the carriage of their grain
but lyman very politely protested addressing his father punctiliously as mr chairman and the other ranchers as gentlemen of the executive committee of the league
he had no wish he said to disarrange the regular proceedings of the committee
would it not be preferable to defer the reading of his report till new business was called for
in the meanwhile let the committee proceed with its usual work
he understood the necessarily delicate nature of this work and would be pleased to withdraw till the proper time arrived for him to speak
good deal of backing and filling about the reading of a column of figures muttered annixter to the man at his elbow
lyman awaited the decision
he sat down touching the ends of his mustache
oh play ball growled annixter
gethings rose to say that as the meeting had been called solely for the purpose of hearing and considering the new grain tariff he was of the opinion that routine business could be dispensed with and the schedule read at once
it was so ordered
lyman rose and made a long speech
voluble as osterman himself he nevertheless had at his command a vast number of readymade phrases the staples of a political speaker the stock in trade of the commercial lawyer which rolled off his tongue with the most persuasive fluency
by degrees in the course of his speech he began to insinuate the idea that the wheatgrowers had never expected to settle their difficulties with the railroad by the work of a single commission that they had counted upon a long continued campaign of many years railway commission succeeding railway commission before the desired low rates should be secured that the present board of commissioners was only the beginning and that too great results were not expected from them
all this he contrived to mention casually in the talk as if it were a foregone conclusion a matter understood by all
as the speech continued the eyes of the ranchers around the table were fixed with growing attention upon this welldressed citybred young man who spoke so fluently and who told them of their own intentions
a feeling of perplexity began to spread and the first taint of distrust invaded their minds
but the good work has been most auspiciously inaugurated continued lyman
reforms so sweeping as the one contemplated cannot be accomplished in a single night
great things grow slowly benefits to be permanent must accrue gradually
yet in spite of all this your commissioners have done much
already the phalanx of the enemy is pierced already his armour is dinted
pledged as were your commissioners to an average ten per cent reduction in rates for the carriage of grain by the pacific and southwestern railroad we have rigidly adhered to the demands of our constituency we have obeyed the people
the main problem has not yet been completely solved that is for later when we shall have gathered sufficient strength to attack the enemy in his very stronghold we have made a great advance have taken a great step forward and if the work is carried ahead upon the lines laid down by the present commissioners and their constituents there is every reason to believe that within a very few years equitable and stable rates for the shipment of grain from the san joaquin valley to stockton port costa and tidewater will be permanently imposed
well hold on exclaimed annixter out of order and ignoring the reproof your commission reduced grain rates in the san joaquin
we have reduced grain rates by ten per cent all over the state rejoined lyman
here are copies of the new schedule
he drew them from his valise and passed them around the table
you see he observed the rate between mayfield and oakland for instance has been reduced by twentyfive cents a ton said old broderson it is rather unusual isnot it for wheat in that district to be sent to oakland
why look here exclaimed annixter looking up from the schedule where is there any reduction in rates in the san bonneville and guadalajara for instance
i donot see as youve made any reduction at all
is this right
did you give me the right schedule
of course the points in the state could not be covered at once returned lyman
we never expected you know that we could cut rates in the san joaquin the very first move that is for later
but you will see we made very material reductions on shipments from the upper sacramento valley also the rate from ione to marysville has been reduced eighty cents a ton
why rot cried annixter no one ever ships wheat that way
the salinas rate continued lyman has been lowered seventyfive cents the st helena rate fifty cents and please notice the very drastic cut from red bluff north along the oregon route to the oregon state line
where not a carload of wheat is shipped in a year commented gethings of the san pablo
oh you will find yourself mistaken there mr gethings returned lyman courteously
and for the matter of that a low rate would stimulate wheatproduction in that district
the order of the meeting was broken up neglected magnus did not even pretend to preside
in the growing excitement over the inexplicable schedule routine was not thought of
every one spoke at will
why lyman demanded magnus looking across the table to his son is this schedule correct
you have not cut rates in the san joaquin at all gentlemen here and myself we are no better off than we were before we secured your election as commissioner
we were pledged to make an average ten per cent cut sir it an average ten per cent cut cried osterman
oh yes thats plain an average ten per cent cut all right but youve made it by cutting grain rates between points where practically no grain is shipped
we the wheatgrowers in the san joaquin where all the wheat is grown are right where we were before
the railroad wonot lose a nickel
by jingo boys he glanced around the table like to know what this means
the railroad if you come to that returned lyman has already lodged a protest against the new rate
annixter uttered a derisive shout protest good that is
when the and objects to rates it donot protest m son
the first you hear from mr shelgrim is an injunction from the courts preventing the order for new rates from taking effect
by the lord he cried angrily leaping to his feet would like to know what all this means too
why didnot you reduce our grain rates
what did we elect you for
yes what did we elect you for demanded osterman and gethings also getting to their feet
order order gentlemen cried magnus remembering the duties of his office and rapping his knuckles on the table
this meeting has been allowed to degenerate too far already
you elected us declared lyman doggedly to make an average ten per cent cut on grain rates
we have done it
only because you donot benefit at once you object
it makes a difference whose ox is gored it seems
lyman
it was magnus who spoke
he had drawn himself to his full six feet
his eyes were flashing direct into his sons
his voice rang with severity
lyman what does this mean
the other spread out his hands
as you see sir
we have done our best
i warned you not to expect too much
i told you that this question of transportation was difficult
you would not wish to put rates so low that the action would amount to confiscation of property
why did you not lower rates in the valley of the san joaquin
that was not a issue in the affair responded lyman carefully emphasising his words understand of course it was to be approached the main point was rates be lowered in the san joaquin
the ranchers around bonneville will be able to ship to port costa at equitable rates but so radical a measure as that cannot be put through in a turn of the hand
we must study you the san joaquin rate was an issue shouted annixter shaking his finger across the table
what do we men who backed you care about rates up in del norte and siskiyou counties
not a whoop in hell
it was the san joaquin rate we were fighting for and we elected you to reduce that
you didnot do it and you donot intend to and by the lord harry i want to know why know sir began lyman
well tell you why vociferated osterman tell you why because we have been sold out because the and have had their spoon in this boiling because our commissioners have betrayed us because were a set of damn fool farmers and have been cinched again
lyman paled under his dark skin at the direct attack
he evidently had not expected this so soon
for the fraction of one instant he lost his poise
he strove to speak but caught his breath stammering
what have you to say then cried harran who until now had not spoken have this to say answered lyman making head as best he might that this is no proper spirit in which to discuss business
the commission has fulfilled its obligations
it has adjusted rates to the best of its ability
we have been at work for two months on the preparation of this schedule a lie shouted annixter his face scarlet a lie
that schedule was drawn in the offices of the pacific and southwestern and you know it a scheme of rates made for the railroad and by the railroad and you were bought over to put your name to it
there was a concerted outburst at the words
all the men in the room were on their feet gesticulating and vociferating
gentlemen gentlemen cried magnus are we schoolboys are we ruffians of the street a set of fool farmers and weve been betrayed cried osterman
well what have you to say
what have you to say persisted harran leaning across the table toward his brother
for sake lyman youve got explanation misunderstood protested lyman white and trembling misunderstood expected too much
next now the commission will take up commission will consider the san joaquin rate done our best that is all
have you sir demanded magnus
the head was in a whirl a sensation almost of faintness had seized upon him
was it possible
was it possible
have you done your best
for a second he compelled eye
the glances of father and son met and in spite of his best efforts eyes wavered
he began to protest once more explaining the matter over again from the beginning
but magnus did not listen
in that brief lapse of time he was convinced that the terrible thing had happened that the unbelievable had come to pass
it was in the air
between father and son in some subtle fashion the truth that was a lie stood suddenly revealed
but even then magnus would not receive it
lyman do this
his son his eldest son descend to this
once more and for the last time he turned to him and in his voice there was that ring that compelled silence
lyman he said adjure demand of you as you are my son and an honourable man explain yourself
what is there behind all this
it is no longer as chairman of the committee i speak to you you a member of the railroad commission
it is your father who speaks and i address you as my son
do you understand the gravity of this crisis do you realise the responsibility of your position do you not see the importance of this moment
explain yourself
there is nothing to explain
you have not reduced rates in the san joaquin
you have not reduced rates between bonneville and tidewater repeat sir what i said before
an average ten per cent cut lyman answer me yes or no
have you reduced the bonneville rate
it could not be done so soon
give us time
we yes or no
by god sir do you dare equivocate with me
yes or no have you reduced the bonneville rate
no
and answer shouted harran leaning far across the table answer were you paid by the railroad to leave the san joaquin rate untouched
lyman whiter than ever turned furious upon his brother you dare put that question to me again
no i wonot cried harran because you to your villains face that you paid to do it
on the instant the clamour burst forth afresh
still on their feet the ranchers had little by little worked around the table magnus alone keeping his place
the others were in a group before lyman crowding him as it were to the wall shouting into his face with menacing gestures
the truth that was a lie the certainty of a trust betrayed a pledge ruthlessly broken was plain to every one of them
by the lord men have been shot for less than this cried osterman sold us out you and if you ever bring that dago face of yours on a level with mine again slap it
keep your hands off exclaimed lyman quickly the aggressiveness of the cornered rat flaming up within him
no violence you go too far
how much were you paid
how much were you paid vociferated harran
yes yes what was your price cried the others
they were beside themselves with anger their words came harsh from between their set teeth their gestures were made with their fists clenched
you know the commission acted in good faith retorted lyman
you know that all was fair and above board
liar shouted annixter liar bribeeater
you were bought and paid for and with the words his arm seemed almost of itself to leap out from his shoulder
lyman received the blow squarely in the face and the force of it sent him staggering backwards toward the wall
he tripped over his valise and fell half way his back supported against the closed door of the room
magnus sprang forward
his son had been struck and the instincts of a father rose up in instant protest rose for a moment then forever died away in his heart
he checked the words that flashed to his mind
he lowered his upraised arm
no he had but one son
the poor staggering creature with the fine clothes white face and bloodstreaked lips was no longer his
a blow could not dishonour him more than he had dishonoured himself
but gethings the older man intervened pulling annixter back crying stop this wonot do
not before his father am no father to this man gentlemen exclaimed magnus
from now on i have but one son
you sir he turned to lyman you sir leave my house
lyman his handkerchief to his lips his smart cravat in disarray caught up his hat and coat
he was shaking with fury his protruding eyes were bloodshot
he swung open the door
ruffians he shouted from the threshold ruffians bullies
do your own dirty business yourselves after this done with you
how is it all of a sudden you talk about honour
how is it that all at once youre so clean and straight
you werenot so particular at sacramento just before the nominations
how was the board elected a bribeeater am is it any worse than a bribe
ask magnus derrick what he thinks about that
ask him how much he paid the democratic bosses at sacramento to swing the convention
he went out slamming the door
presley followed
the whole affair made him sick at heart filled him with infinite disgust infinite weariness
he wished to get away from it all
he left the diningroom and the excited clamouring men behind him and stepped out on the porch of the ranch house closing the door behind him
lyman was nowhere in sight
presley was alone
it was late and after the lampheated air of the diningroom the coolness of the night was delicious and its vast silence after the noise and fury of the committee meeting descended from the stars like a benediction
presley stepped to the edge of the porch looking off to southward
and there before him mile after mile illimitable covering the earth from horizon to horizon lay the wheat
the growth now many days old was already high from the ground
there it lay a vast silent ocean shimmering a pallid green under the moon and under the stars a mighty force the strength of nations the life of the world
there in the night under the dome of the sky it was growing steadily
to mind the scene in the room he had just left dwindled to paltry insignificance before this sight
ah yes the was over this that the railroad the ranchers the traitor false to his trust all the members of an obscure conspiracy were wrangling
as if human agency could affect this colossal power
what were these heated tiny squabbles this feverish small bustle of mankind this minute swarming of the human insect to the great majestic silent ocean of the wheat itself
indifferent gigantic resistless it moved in its appointed grooves
men liliputians gnats in the sunshine buzzed impudently in their tiny battles were born lived through their little day died and were forgotten while the wheat wrapped in nirvanic calm grew steadily under the night alone with the stars and with god were a pest that year and presley occasionally found amusement in hunting them with halfdozen greyhounds following the chase on horseback
one day between two and three months after lyman visit to los muertos as he was returning toward the ranch house from a distant and lonely quarter of los muertos he came unexpectedly upon a strange sight
some twenty men and tenants and small ranchers from east of members of the going through the manual of arms under harran supervision
they were all equipped with new winchester rifles
harran carried one of these himself and with it he illustrated the various commands he gave
as soon as one of the men under his supervision became more than usually proficient he was told off to instruct a file of the more backward
after the manual of arms harran gave the command to take distance as skirmishers and when the line had opened out so that some halfdozen feet intervened between each man an advance was made across the field the men stooping low and snapping the hammers of their rifles at an imaginary enemy
the league had its agents in san francisco who watched the movements of the railroad as closely as was possible and some time before this annixter had received word that the marshal and his deputies were coming down to bonneville to put the dummy buyers of his ranch in possession
the report proved to be but the first of many false alarms but it had stimulated the league to unusual activity and some three or four hundred men were furnished with arms and from time to time were drilled in secret
among themselves the ranchers said that if the railroad managers did not believe they were terribly in earnest in the stand they had taken they were making a fatal mistake
harran reasserted this statement to presley on the way home to the ranch house that same day
harran had caught up with him by the time he reached the lower road and the two jogged homeward through the miles of standing wheat
they may jump the ranch pres he said if they try hard enough but they will never do it while i am alive
by the way he added you know we served notices yesterday upon behrman and cy
ruggles to quit the country
of course they wonot do it but they wonot be able to say they didnot have warning
about an hour later the two reached the ranch house but as harran rode up the driveway he uttered an exclamation
hello he said something is up buckboard
in fact the editors team was tied underneath the shade of a giant eucalyptus tree near by
harran uneasy under this unexpected visit of the enemys friend dismounted without stabling his horse and went at once to the diningroom where visitors were invariably received
but the diningroom was empty and his mother told him that magnus and the editor were in the office
magnus had said they were not to be disturbed
earlier in the afternoon the editor had driven up to the porch and had asked mrs derrick whom he found reading a book of poems on the porch if he could see magnus
at the time the governor had gone with phelps to inspect the condition of the young wheat on holding but within half an hour he returned and genslinger had asked him for a few moments talk in private
the two went into the office magnus locking the door behind him
very complete you are here governor observed the editor in his alert jerky manner his black beadlike eyes twinkling around the room from behind his glasses
telephone safe ticker accountbookswell thats progress isnot it
only way to manage a big ranch these days
but the day of the big ranch is over
as the land appreciates in value the temptation to sell off small holdings will be too strong
and then the small holding can be cultivated to better advantage
i shall have an editorial on that some day
the cost of maintaining a number of small holdings said magnus indifferently is of course greater than if they were all under one management
that may be that may be rejoined the other
there was a long pause
genslinger leaned back in his chair and rubbed a knee
magnus standing erect in front of the safe waited for him to speak
this is an unfortunate business governor began the editor this misunderstanding between the ranchers and the railroad
i wish it could be adjusted are two industries that be in harmony with one another or we all go to pot should prefer not to be interviewed on the subject mr genslinger said magnus
oh no oh no
lord love you governor i donot want to interview you
we all know how you stand
again there was a long silence
magnus wondered what this little man usually so garrulous could want of him
at length genslinger began again
he did not look at magnus except at long intervals
about the present railroad commission he remarked
that was an interesting campaign you conducted in sacramento and san francisco
magnus held his peace his hands shut tight
did genslinger know of disgrace
was it for this he had come
would the story of it be the leading article in mercury
an interesting campaign repeated genslinger slowly a very interesting campaign
i watched it with every degree of interest
i saw its every phase mr derrick
the campaign was not without its interest admitted magnus
yes said genslinger still more deliberately and some phases of it interesting than others as for instance let us say the way in which the votes of certain chairmen of i particularise further
yes those way you got their votes
now i should say mr derrick was the most interesting move in the whole you
hm curious he murmured musingly see
you deposited two onethousand dollar bills and four fivehundred dollar bills in a hundred and eight was the a box in the safety deposit vaults in san francisco and see you gave a key to this box to each of the gentlemen in question and after the election the box was empty
now i call that interestingcurious because its a new safe and highly ingenious method of bribery
how did you happen to think of it governor
do you know what you are doing sir
magnus burst forth
do you know what you are insinuating here in my own house
why governor returned the editor blandly not anything talking about what i a lie
genslinger rubbed his chin reflectively
well he answered you can have a chance to prove it before the grand jury if you want to
my character is known all over the state blustered magnus
my politics are pure politics
my no one needs a better reputation for pure politics than the man who sets out to be a briber interrupted genslinger and i might as well tell you governor that you canot shout me down
i can put my hand on the two chairmen you bought before its dark today had their depositions in my safe for the last six weeks
we could make the arrests tomorrow if we wanted
governor you sure did a risky thing when you went into that sacramento fight an awful risky thing
some men can afford to have bribery charges preferred against them and it donot hurt one little bit but it would you governor bust you dead
i know all about the whole shananigan business from a to and if you donot believe ithere he drew a long strip of paper from his pocket a galley proof of the story
magnus took it in his hands
there under his eyes scareheaded doubleleaded the more important clauses printed in bold type was the detailed account of the deal magnus had made with the two delegates
it was pitiless remorseless bald
every statement was substantiated every statistic verified with meticulous love for exactness
besides all that it had the ring of truth
it was exposure ruin absolute annihilation about correct isnot it commented genslinger as derrick finished reading
magnus did not reply think it is correct enough the editor continued
but i thought it would only be fair to you to let you see it before it was published
the one thought uppermost in mind his one impulse of the moment was at whatever cost to preserve his dignity not to allow this man to exult in the sight of one quiver of weakness one trace of defeat one suggestion of humiliation
by an effort that put all his iron rigidity to the test he forced himself to look straight into eyes congratulate you he observed handing back the proof upon your journalistic enterprise
your paper will sell tomorrow
oh i donot know as i want to publish this story remarked the editor indifferently putting away the galley just like that
the fun for me is running a good story to earth but once got it i lose interest
and then i wouldnot like to see the position you do president of the league and a leading man of the wouldnot like to see a story like this smash you over worth more to you to keep it out of print than for me to put it in got nothing much to gain but a few extra editions but you would lose everything
your committee was in the deal right enough
but your league all the san joaquin valley everybody in the state believes the commissioners were fairly elected
your story suddenly exclaimed magnus struck with an idea will be thoroughly discredited just so soon as the new grain tariff is published
i have means of knowing that the san joaquin issue upon which the board was not to be touched
is it likely the ranchers would secure the election of a board that plays them false
oh we know all about that answered genslinger smiling
you thought you were electing lyman easily
you thought you had got the railroad to walk right into your trap
you didnot understand how you could pull off your deal so easily
why governor he was man the corporation wanted for commissioner
and your people elected the railroad all the trouble of campaigning for him
and you canot make any counter charge of bribery there
no sir the corporation donot use such amateurish methods as that
confidentially and between us two all that the railroad has done for lyman in order to attach him to their interests is to promise to back him politically in the next campaign for governor too bad he continued dropping his voice and changing his position
it really is too bad to see good men trying to bunt a stone wall over with their bare heads
you couldnot have won at any stage of the game
i wish i could have talked to you and your friends before you went into that sacramento fight
i could have told you then how little chance you had
when will you people realise that you canot buck against the railroad
why magnus its like me going out in a paper boat and shooting peas at a battleship
is that all you wished to see me about mr genslinger remarked magnus bestirring himself am rather occupied today
well returned the other you know what the publication of this article would mean for you
he paused again took off his glasses breathed on them polished the lenses with his handkerchief and readjusted them on his nose been thinking governor he began again with renewed alertness and quite irrelevantly of enlarging the scope of the mercury
you see midway between the two big centres of the state san francisco and los angeles and i want to extend the sphere of influence as far up and down the valley as i can
i want to illustrate the paper
you see if i had a photoengraving plant of my own i could do a good deal of outside jobbing as well and the investment would pay ten per cent
but it takes money to make money
i wouldnot want to put in any dinky onehorse affair
i want a good plant been figuring out the business
besides the plant there would be the expense of a high grade paper print halftones on anything but coated paper and that well what with this and with that and running expenses till the thing began to pay it would cost me about ten thousand dollars and i was wondering if perhaps you couldnot see your way clear to accommodating me
ten thousand
yes
say five thousand down and the balance within sixty days
magnus for the moment blind to what genslinger had in mind turned on him in astonishment
why man what security could you give me for such an amount
well to tell the truth answered the editor hadnot thought much about securities
in fact i believed you would see how greatly it was to your advantage to talk business with me
you see not going to print this article about you governor and not going to let it get out so as any one else can print it and it seems to me that one good turn deserves another
you understand
magnus understood
an overwhelming desire suddenly took possession of him to grip this blackmailer by the throat to strangle him where he stood or if not at least to turn upon him with that oldtime terrible anger before which whole conventions had once cowered
but in the same moment the governor realised this was not to be
only its righteousness had made his wrath terrible only the justice of his anger had made him feared
now the foundation was gone from under his feet he had knocked it away himself
three times feeble was he whose quarrel was unjust
before this country editor this paid speaker of the railroad he stood convicted
the man had him at his mercy
the detected briber could not resent an insult
genslinger rose smoothing his hat
well he said of course you want time to think it over and you canot raise money like that on short notice wait till friday noon of this week
we begin to set paper at about four friday afternoon and the forms are locked about two in the morning
i hope he added turning back at the door of the room that you wonot find anything disagreeable in your saturday morning mercury mr derrick
he went out closing the door behind him and in a moment magnus heard the wheels of his buckboard grating on the driveway
the following morning brought a letter to magnus from gethings of the san pueblo ranch which was situated very close to visalia
the letter was to the effect that all around visalia upon the ranches affected by the regrade of the railroad men were arming and drilling and that the strength of the league in that quarter was undoubted
but to refer continued the letter to a most painful recollection
you will no doubt remember that at the close of our last committee meeting specific charges were made as to fraud in the nomination and election of one of our commissioners emanating most unfortunately from the commissioner himself
these charges my dear mr derrick were directed at yourself
how the secrets of the committee have been noised about i cannot understand
you may be of course assured of my own unquestioning confidence and loyalty
however i regret exceedingly to state not only that the rumour of the charges referred to above is spreading in this district but that also they are made use of by the enemies of the league
it is to be deplored that some of the leaguers know we number in our ranks many small farmers ignorant portuguese and listened to these stories and have permitted a feeling of uneasiness to develop among them
even though it were admitted that fraudulent means had been employed in the elections which of course i personally do not admit i do not think it would make very much difference in the confidence which the vast majority of the leaguers repose in their chiefs
yet we have so insisted upon the probity of our position as opposed to railroad chicanery that i believe it advisable to quell this distant suspicion at once to publish a denial of these rumoured charges would only be to give them too much importance
however can you not write me a letter stating exactly how the campaign was conducted and the commission nominated and elected
i could show this to some of the more disaffected and it would serve to allay all suspicion on the instant
i think it would be well to write as though the initiative came not from me but from yourself ignoring this present letter
i offer this only as a suggestion and will confidently endorse any decision you may arrive at
the letter closed with renewed protestations of confidence
magnus was alone when he read this
he put it carefully away in the filing cabinet in his office and wiped the sweat from his forehead and face
he stood for one moment his hands rigid at his sides his fists clinched
this is piling up he muttered looking blankly at the opposite wall
my god this is piling up
what am i to do
ah the bitterness of unavailing regret the anguish of compromise with conscience the remorse of a bad deed done in a moment of excitement
ah the humiliation of detection the degradation of being caught caught like a schoolboy pilfering his fellows desks and worse than all worse than all the consciousness of lost selfrespect the knowledge of a prestige vanishing a dignity impaired knowledge that the grip which held a multitude in check was trembling that control was wavering that command was being weakened
then the little tricks to deceive the crowd the little subterfuges the little pretences that kept up appearances the lies the bluster the pose the strut the gasconade where once was iron authority the turning of the head so as not to see that which could not be prevented the suspicion of suspicion the haunting fear of the man on the street the uneasiness of the direct glance the questioning as to had this been said what was meant by that word that gesture that glance
wednesday passed and thursday
magnus kept to himself seeing no visitors avoiding even his family
how to break through the mesh of the net how to regain the old position how to prevent discovery
if there were only some way some vast superhuman effort by which he could rise in his old strength once more crushing lyman with one hand genslinger with the other and for one more moment the last to stand supreme again indomitable the leader then go to his death triumphant at the end his memory untarnished his fame undimmed
but the plaguespot was in himself knitted forever into the fabric of his being
though genslinger should be silenced though lyman should be crushed though even the league should overcome the railroad though he should be the acknowledged leader of a resplendent victory yet the plaguespot would remain
there was no success for him now
however conspicuous the outward achievement he he himself magnus derrick had failed miserably and irredeemably
petty material complications intruded sordid considerations
even if genslinger was to be paid where was the money to come from
his legal battles with the railroad extending now over a period of many years had cost him dear his plan of sowing all of los muertos to wheat discharging the tenants had proved expensive the campaign resulting in election had drawn heavily upon his account
all along he had been relying upon a bonanza crop to reimburse him
it was not believable that the railroad would jump los muertos but if this should happen he would be left without resources
ten thousand dollars
could he raise the amount
possibly
but to pay it out to a blackmailer
to be held up thus in roadagent fashion without a single means of redress
would it not cripple him financially
genslinger could do his worst
he magnus would brave it out
was not his character above suspicion
was it
this letter of already the murmur of uneasiness made itself heard
was this not the thin edge of the wedge
how the publication of story would drive it home
how the spark of suspicion would flare into the blaze of open accusation
there would be investigations
investigation
there was terror in the word
he could not stand investigation
magnus groaned aloud covering his head with his clasped hands
briber corrupter of government ballotbox stuffer descending to the level of backroom politicians of barroom heelers he magnus derrick statesman of the old school roman in his iron integrity abandoning a career rather than enter the new politics had in one moment of weakness hazarding all even honour on a single stake taking great chances to achieve great results swept away the work of a lifetime
gambler that he was he had at last chanced his highest stake his personal honour in the greatest game of his life and had lost
it was morbidly keen observation that first noticed the evidence of a new trouble in the face and manner
presley was sure that defection had not so upset him
the morning after the committee meeting magnus had called harran and annie derrick into the office and after telling his wife of betrayal had forbidden either of them to mention his name again
his attitude towards his prodigal son was that of stern unrelenting resentment
but now presley could not fail to detect traces of a more deepseated travail
something was in the wind the times were troublous
what next was about to happen
what fresh calamity impended
one morning toward the very end of the week presley woke early in his small whitepainted iron bed
he hastened to get up and dress
there was much to be done that day
until late the night before he had been at work on a collection of some of his verses gathered from the magazines in which they had first appeared
presley had received a liberal offer for the publication of these verses in book form
the toilers was to be included in this book and indeed was to give it its toilers and other poems
thus it was that until the previous midnight he had been preparing the collection for publication revising annotating arranging
the book was to be sent off that morning
but also presley had received a typewritten note from annixter inviting him to quien sabe that same day
annixter explained that it was birthday and that he had planned a picnic on the high ground of his ranch at the headwaters of broderson creek
they were to go in the carryall hilma presley mrs dyke sidney and himself and were to make a day of it
they would leave quien sabe at ten in the morning
presley had at once resolved to go
he was immensely fond of so than ever since his marriage with hilma and the astonishing transformation of his character
hilma as well was delightful as mrs annixter and mrs dyke and the little tad had always been his friends
he would have a good time
but nobody was to go into bonneville that morning with the mail and if he wished to send his manuscript he would have to take it in himself
he had resolved to do this getting an early start and going on horseback to quien sabe by way of bonneville
it was barely six oclock when presley sat down to his coffee and eggs in the diningroom of los muertos
the day promised to be hot and for the first time presley had put on a new khaki riding suit very though in place of the regulation topboots he wore his laced kneeboots with a great spur on the left heel
harran joined him at breakfast in his working clothes of blue canvas
he was bound for the irrigating ditch to see how the work was getting on there
how is the wheat looking asked presley
bully answered the other stirring his coffee
the governor has had his usual luck
practically every acre of the ranch was sown to wheat and everywhere the stand is good
i was over on two day before yesterday and if nothing happens i believe it will go thirty sacks to the acre there
cutter reports that there are spots on four where we will get fortytwo or three
hooven too brought up some wonderful fine ears for me to look at
the grains were just beginning to show
some of the ears carried twenty grains
that means nearly forty bushels of wheat to every acre
i call it a bonanza year
have you got any mail said presley rising going into town
harran shook his head and took himself away and presley went down to the stablecorral to get his pony
as he rode out of the stableyard and passed by the ranch house on the driveway he was surprised to see magnus on the lowest step of the porch
good morning governor called presley you up pretty early
good morning pres my boy
the governor came forward and putting his hand on the ponys withers walked along by his side
going to town pres he asked
yes sir
can i do anything for you governor
magnus drew a sealed envelope from his pocket wish you would drop in at the office of the mercury for me he said and see mr genslinger personally and give him this envelope
it is a package of papers but they involve a considerable sum of money and you must be careful of them
a few years ago when our enmity was not so strong mr genslinger and i had some business dealings with each other
i thought it as well just now considering that we are so openly opposed to terminate the whole affair and break off relations
we came to a settlement a few days ago these are the final papers
they must be given to him in person presley
you understand
presley cantered on turning into the county road and holding northward by the mammoth watering tank and popular windbreak
as he passed he saw the saloonkeeper in the doorway of his place and waved him a salutation which the other returned
by degrees presley had come to consider caraher in a more favourable light
he found to his immense astonishment that caraher knew something of mill and bakounin not however from their books but from extracts and quotations from their writings reprinted in the anarchistic journals to which he subscribed
more than once the two had held long conversations and from own lips presley heard the terrible story of the death of his wife who had been accidentally killed by pinkertons during a demonstration of strikers
it invested the saloonkeeper in imagination with all the dignity of the tragedy
he could not blame caraher for being a red
he even wondered how it was the saloonkeeper had not put his theories into practice and adjusted his ancient wrong with his six inches of plugged gaspipe
presley began to conceive of the man as a character
you wait mr presley the saloonkeeper had once said when presley had protested against his radical ideas
you donot know the railroad yet
watch it and its doings long enough and youll come over to my way of thinking too
it was about halfpast seven when presley reached bonneville
the business part of the town was as yet hardly astir he despatched his manuscript and then hurried to the office of the mercury
genslinger as he feared had not yet put in appearance but the janitor of the building gave presley the address of the editors residence and it was there he found him in the act of sitting down to breakfast
presley was hardly courteous to the little man and abruptly refused his offer of a drink
he delivered envelope to him and departed
it had occurred to him that it would not do to present himself at quien sabe on birthday emptyhanded and on leaving house he turned his ponys head toward the business part of the town again pulling up in front of the jewellers just as the clerk was taking down the shutters
at the jewellers he purchased a little brooch for hilma and at the cigar stand in the lobby of the yosemite house a box of superfine cigars which when it was too late he realised that the master of quien sabe would never smoke holding as he did with defiant inconsistency to miserable weeds black bitter and flagrantly doctored which he bought three for a nickel at guadalajara
presley arrived at quien sabe nearly half an hour behind the appointed time but as he had expected the party were in no way ready to start
the carryall its horses covered with white flynets stood under a tree near the house young vacca dozing on the seat
hilma and sidney the latter exuberant with a gayety that all but brought the tears to eyes were making sandwiches on the back porch
mrs dyke was nowhere to be seen and annixter was shaving himself in his bedroom
this latter put a halflathered face out of the window as presley cantered through the gate and waved his razor with a beckoning motion
come on in pres he cried ready yet hours ahead of time
presley came into the bedroom his huge spur clinking on the straw matting
annixter was without coat vest or collar his blue silk suspenders hung in loops over either hip his hair was disordered the crown lock stiffer than ever
glad to see you old boy he announced as presley came in
no donot shake hands all lather
here find a chair will you
i wonot be long thought you said ten oclock observed presley sitting down on the edge of the bed
well i did but but then again in a way you didnot hey his friend interrupted
annixter grunted goodhumouredly and turned to strop his razor
presley looked with suspicious disfavour at his suspenders
why is it he observed that as soon as a man is about to get married he buys himself pale blue suspenders silk ones
think of it
you buck annixter with skyblue silk suspenders
it ought to be a strap and a nail
old fool observed annixter whose repartee was the heaving of brick bats
say he continued holding the razor from his face and jerking his head over his shoulder while he looked at reflection in his mirror say look around this a nifty little room
we refitted the whole house you know
notice shes all painted have been looking around answered presley sweeping the room with a series of glances
he forebore criticism
annixter was so boyishly proud of the effect that it would have been unkind to have undeceived him
presley looked at the marvellous departmentstore bed of brass with its brave gay canopy the millmade washstand with its pitcher and bowl of blinding red and green china the strawframed lithographs of symbolic female figures against the multicoloured new wallpaper the inadequate spindle chairs of white and gold the sphere of tissue paper hanging from the gas fixture and the plumes of pampas grass tacked to the wall at artistic angles and overhanging two astonishing oil paintings in dazzling golden frames
say how about those paintings pres inquired annixter a little uneasily donot know whether theyre good or not
they were painted by a threefingered chinaman in monterey and i got the lot for thirty dollars frames thrown in
why i think the frames alone are worth thirty dollars
well so do declared presley
he hastened to change the subject
buck he said hear youve brought mrs dyke and sidney to live with you
you know i think thats rather white of you
oh rot pres muttered annixter turning abruptly to his shaving
and you canot fool me either old man presley continued giving this picnic as much for mrs dyke and the little tad as you are for your wife just to cheer them up a bit
oh pshaw you make me sick
well thats the right thing to do buck and as glad for your sake as i am for theirs
there was a time when you would have let them all go to grass and never so much as thought of them
i donot want to seem to be officious but youve changed for the better old man and i guess i know why
she presley caught his friends eye and added gravely a good woman buck
annixter turned around abruptly his face flushing under its lather
pres he exclaimed made a man of me
i was a machine before and if another man or woman or child got in my way i rode em down and i never of anybody else but myself
but as soon as i woke up to the fact that i really loved her why it was glory hallelujah all in a minute and in a way i kind of loved everybody then and wanted to be everybodys friend
and i began to see that a fellow canot live himself any more than he can live himself got to think of others
if hes got brains hes got to think for the poor ducks that havenot em and not give em a boot in the backsides because they happen to be stupid and if hes got money hes got to help those that are busted and if hes got a house hes got to think of those that ainot got anywhere to go got a whole lot of ideas since i began to love hilma and just as soon as i can going to get in and people and going to keep to that idea the rest of my natural life
that ainot much of a religion but its the best got and henry ward beecher couldnot do any more than that
and its all come about because of hilma and because we cared for each other
presley jumped up and caught annixter about the shoulders with one arm gripping his hand hard
this absurd figure with dangling silk suspenders lathered chin and tearful eyes seemed to be suddenly invested with true nobility
beside this blundering struggle to do right to help his fellows own vague schemes glittering systems of reconstruction collapsed to ruin and he himself with all his refinement with all his poetry culture and education stood a bungler at the worlds workbench all old man he exclaimed unable to think of anything adequate all right the way to talk and here by the way i brought you a box of cigars
annixter stared as presley laid the box on the edge of the washstand
old fool he remarked what in hell did you do that for
oh just for fun suppose theyre rotten stinkodoras or you wouldnot give em away
this cringing gratitude presley began
shut up shouted annixter and the incident was closed
annixter resumed his shaving and presley lit a cigarette
any news from washington he queried
nothing thats any good grunted annixter
hello he added raising his head somebody in a hurry for sure
the noise of a horse galloping so fast that the hoofbeats sounded in one uninterrupted rattle abruptly made itself heard
the noise was coming from the direction of the road that led from the mission to quien sabe
with incredible swiftness the hoofbeats drew nearer
there was that in their sound which brought presley to his feet
annixter threw open the window
runaway exclaimed presley
annixter with thoughts of the railroad and the jumping of the ranch flung his hand to his hip pocket
what is it vacca he cried
young vacca turning in his seat in the carryall was looking up the road
all at once he jumped from his place and dashed towards the window
dyke he shouted
dyke its dyke
while the words were yet in his mouth the sound of the hoofbeats rose to a roar and a great belltoned voice shouted annixter annixter annixter
it was voice and the next instant he shot into view in the open square in front of the house
oh my god cried presley
the exengineer threw the horse on its haunches springing from the saddle and as he did so the beast collapsed shuddering to the ground
annixter sprang from the window and ran forward presley following
there was dyke hatless his pistol in his hand a gaunt terrible figure the beard immeasurably long the cheeks fallen in the eyes sunken
his clothes ripped and torn by weeks of flight and hiding in the chaparral were ragged beyond words the boots were shreds of leather bloody to the ankle with furious spurring
annixter he shouted and again rolling his sunken eyes annixter annixter
here here cried annixter
the other turned levelling his pistol
give me a horse give me a horse quick do you hear
give me a horse or shoot
steady steady
that wonot do
you know me dyke friends here
the other lowered his weapon know i know he panted forgotten unstrung mr annixter and running for my life not ten minutes behind me
come on come on shouted annixter dashing stablewards his suspenders flying a horse
mine exclaimed presley
he wouldnot carry you a mile
annixter was already far ahead trumpeting orders
the buckskin he yelled
get her out billy the stableman
get out that buckskin
get out that saddle
then followed minutes of furious haste presley annixter billy the stableman and dyke himself darting hither and thither about the yellow mare buckling strapping cinching their lips pale their fingers trembling with excitement
want anything to eat head was under the saddle flap as he tore at the cinch
want anything to eat
want any money
want a gun
water returned dyke watched every spring killed with thirst the hydrant
quick now got as far as the kern river but they turned me back he said between breaths as he drank stop to talk
my mother and the little tad taking care of them stopping with me
here
you wonot see em by the lord you wonot get away that back cinch strap god damn it are you going to let him be shot before he can get away
now dyke up you go kill herself running before they can catch you
god bless you annixter the little tad
is she well annixter and the mother
tell them yes yes yes
all clear pres
let her have her own gait dyke on the best horse in the county now
let go her head billy
now hands
you bet i will all right
yes god bless you
let her go
answering the goad of the spur and already quivering with the excitement of the men who surrounded her the buckskin cleared the stablecorral in two leaps then gathering her legs under her her head low her neck stretched out swung into the road from out the driveway disappearing in a blur of dust
with the agility of a monkey young vacca swung himself into the framework of the artesian well clambering aloft to its very top
he swept the country with a glance
well demanded annixter from the ground
the others cocked their heads to listen see him i see him shouted vacca going like the devil headed for guadalajara
look back up the road toward the mission
anything there
the answer came down in a shout of apprehension a party of men
three or horseback dogs with em coming this way
oh i can hear the dogs
and say oh say theres another party coming down the lower road going towards guadalajara too
they got guns
i can see the shine of the barrels
and oh lord say theres three more men on horses coming down on the jump from the hills on the los muertos stock range making towards guadalajara
and i can hear the courthouse bell in bonneville ringing
say the whole county is up
as young vacca slid down to the ground two small hounds with flapping ears and lolling tongues loped into view on the road in front of the house
they were grey with dust their noses were to the ground
at the gate where dyke had turned into the ranch house grounds they halted in confusion a moment
one started to follow the highwaymans trail towards the stable corral but the other quartering over the road with lightning swiftness suddenly picked up the new scent leading on towards guadalajara
he tossed his head in the air and presley abruptly shut his hands over his ears
ah that terrible cry deeptoned reverberating like the bourdon of a great bell
it was the trackers exulting on the trail of the pursued the prolonged raucous howl eager ominous vibrating with the alarm of the tocsin sullen with the heavy muffling note of death
but close upon the bay of the hounds came the gallop of horses
five men their eyes upon the hounds their rifles across their pommels their horses reeking and black with sweat swept by in a storm of dust glinting hoofs and streaming manes
that was gang exclaimed annixter saw him
the other was that chap christian said vacca cousin
he had two deputies with him and the chap in the white slouch hat was the sheriff from visalia
by the lord they arenot far behind declared annixter
as the men turned towards the house again they saw hilma and mrs dyke in the doorway of the little house where the latter lived
they were looking out bewildered ignorant of what had happened
but on the porch of the ranch house itself alone forgotten in the excitement little tadstood with pale face and serious wideopen eyes
she had seen everything and had understood
she said nothing
her head inclined towards the roadway she listened to the faint and distant baying of the dogs
dyke thundered across the railway tracks by the depot at guadalajara not five minutes ahead of his pursuers
luck seemed to have deserted him
the station usually so quiet was now occupied by the crew of a freight train that lay on the down track while on the up line near at hand and headed in the same direction was a detached locomotive whose engineer and fireman recognized him he was sure as the buckskin leaped across the rails
he had had no time to formulate a plan since that morning when tortured with thirst he had ventured near the spring at the headwaters of broderson creek on quien sabe and had all but fallen into the hands of the posse that had been watching for that very move
it was useless now to regret that he had tried to foil pursuit by turning back on his tracks to regain the mountains east of bonneville
now delaney was almost on him
to distance that posse was the only thing to be thought of now
it was no longer a question of hiding till pursuit should flag they had driven him out from the shelter of the mountains down into this populous countryside where an enemy might be met with at every turn of the road
now it was life or death
he would either escape or be killed
he knew very well that he would never allow himself to be taken alive
but he had no mind to be turn and escape was blocked
his one thought was to leave pursuit behind
weeks of flight had sharpened every sense
as he turned into the upper road beyond guadalajara he saw the three men galloping down from stock range making for the road ahead of him
they would cut him off there
he swung the buckskin about
he must take the lower road across los muertos from guadalajara and he must reach it before dogs and posse
back he galloped the buckskin measuring her length with every leap
once more the station came in sight
rising in his stirrups he looked across the fields in the direction of the lower road
there was a cloud of dust there
from a wagon
no horses on the run and their riders were armed
he could catch the flash of gun barrels
they were all closing in on him converging on guadalajara by every available road
the upper road west of guadalajara led straight to bonneville
that way was impossible
was he in a trap
had the time for fighting come at last
but as dyke neared the depot at guadalajara his eye fell upon the detached locomotive that lay quietly steaming on the up line and with a thrill of exultation he remembered that he was an engineer born and bred dogs were already to be heard and the roll of hoofs on the lower road was dinning in his ears as he leaped from the buckskin before the depot
the train crew scattered like frightened sheep before him but dyke ignored them
his pistol was in his hand as once more on foot he sprang toward the lone engine
out of the cab he shouted
both of you
quick or kill you both
the two men tumbled from the iron apron of the tender as dyke swung himself up dropping his pistol on the floor of the cab and reaching with the old instinct for the familiar levers
the great compound hissed and trembled as the steam was released and the huge drivers stirred turning slowly on the tracks
but there was a shout posse dogs and men swung into view at the turn of the road their figures leaning over as they took the curve at full speed
dyke threw everything wide open and caught up his revolver
from behind came the challenge of a winchester
the party on the lower road were even closer than delaney
they had seen his manoeuvre and the first shot of the fight shivered the cab windows above the engineers head
but spinning futilely at first the drivers of the engine at last caught the rails
the engine moved advanced travelled past the depot and the freight train and gathering speed rolled out on the track beyond
smoke black and boiling shot skyward from the stack not a joint that did not shudder with the mighty strain of the steam but the great iron of newest and to call obedient and docile as soon as ever the great pulsing heart of it felt a master hand upon its levers
it gathered its speed bracing its steel muscles its thews of iron and roared out upon the open track filling the air with the rasp of its tempestbreath blotting the sunshine with the belch of its hot thick smoke
already it was lessening in the distance when delaney christian and the sheriff of visalia dashed up to the station
the posse had seen everything
stuck
curse the luck vociferated the but the sheriff was already out of the saddle and into the telegraph office a derailing switch between here and pixley isnot there he cried
yes
wire ahead to open it derail him there
come on he turned to delaney and the others
they sprang into the cab of the locomotive that was attached to the freight train
name of the state of california shouted the sheriff to the bewildered engineer
cut off from your train
the sheriff was a man to be obeyed without hesitating
time was not allowed the crew of the freight train for debating as to the right or the wrong of requisitioning the engine and before anyone thought of the safety or danger of the affair the freight engine was already flying out upon the down line hot in pursuit of dyke now far ahead upon the up track remember perfectly well theres a derailing switch between here and pixley shouted the sheriff above the roar of the locomotive
they use it in case they have to derail runaway engines
it runs right off into the country pile him up there
ready with your guns boys
if we should meet another train coming up on this track protested the frightened engineer
then wed jump or be smashed
hi look
there he is
as the freight engine rounded a curve engine came into view shooting on some quarter of a mile ahead of them wreathed in whirling smoke
the switch ainot much further on clamoured the engineer
you can see pixley now
dyke his hand on the grip of the valve that controlled the steam his head out of the cab window thundered on
he was back in his old place again once more he was the engineer once more he felt the engine quiver under him the familiar noises were in his ears the familiar buffeting of the wind surged roaring at his face the familiar odours of hot steam and smoke reeked in his nostrils and on either side of him parallel panoramas the two halves of the landscape sliced as it were in two by the clashing wheels of his engine streamed by in green and brown blurs
he found himself settling to the old position on the cab seat leaning on his elbow from the window one hand on the controller
all at once the instinct of the pursuit that of late had become so strong within him prompted him to shoot a glance behind
he saw the other engine on the down line plunging after him rocking from side to side with the fury of its gallop
not yet had he shaken the trackers from his heels not yet was he out of the reach of danger
he set his teeth and throwing open the firedoor stoked vigorously for a few moments
the indicator of the steam gauge rose his speed increased a glance at the telegraph poles told him he was doing his fifty miles an hour
the freight engine behind him was never built for that pace
barring the terrible risk of accident his chances were good
but engineer dominating the shut off his steam and threw back his brake to the extreme notch
directly ahead of him rose a semaphore placed at a point where evidently a derailing switch branched from the line
the semaphores arm was dropped over the track setting the danger signal that showed the switch was open
in an instant dyke saw the trick
they had meant to smash him here had been clever enough quickwitted enough to open the switch but had forgotten the automatic semaphore that worked simultaneously with the movement of the rails
to go forward was certain destruction
dyke reversed
there was nothing for it but to go back
with a wrench and a spasm of all its metal fibres the great compound braced itself sliding with rigid wheels along the rails
then as dyke applied the reverse it drew back from the greater danger returning towards the less
inevitably now the two engines one on the up the other on the down line must meet and pass each other
dyke released the levers reaching for his revolver
the engineer once more became the highwayman in peril of his life
now beyond all doubt the time for fighting was at hand
the party in the heavy freight engine that lumbered after in pursuit their eyes fixed on the smudge of smoke on ahead that marked the path of the fugitive suddenly raised a shout stopped broke down
watch now and see if he jumps off
broke ready now hes got to pass us
the engineer applied the brakes but the heavy freight locomotive far less mobile than flyer was slow to obey
the smudge on the rails ahead grew swiftly larger coming out theres a shot shooting already
a bright white sliver of wood leaped into the air from the sooty window sill of the cab
fire on him
fire on him
while the engines were yet two hundred yards apart the duel began shot answering shot the sharp staccato reports punctuating the thunder of wheels and the clamour of steam
then the ground trembled and rocked a roar as of heavy ordnance developed with the abruptness of an explosion
the two engines passed each other the men firing the while emptying their revolvers shattering wood shivering glass the bullets clanging against the metal work as they struck and struck and struck
the men leaned from the cabs towards each other frantic with excitement shouting curses the engines rocking the steam roaring confusion whirling in the scene like the whirl of a witchs dance the white clouds of steam the black eddies from the smokestack the blue wreaths from the hot mouths of revolvers swirling together in a blinding maze of vapour spinning around them dazing them dizzying them while the head rang with hideous clamour and the body twitched and trembled with the leap and jar of the tumult of machinery
roaring clamouring reeking with the smell of powder and hot oil spitting death resistless huge furious an abrupt vision of chaos faces ragedistorted peering through smoke hands gripping outward from sudden darkness prehensile malevolent terrible as thunder swift as lightning the two engines met and passed hit cried delaney know i hit him
he canot go far now
after him again
he wonot dare go through bonneville
it was true
dyke had stood between cab and tender throughout all the duel exposed reckless thinking only of attack and not of defence and a bullet from one of the pistols had grazed his hip
how serious was the wound he did not know but he had no thought of giving up
he tore back through the depot at guadalajara in a storm of bullets and clinging to the broken window ledge of his cab was carried towards bonneville on over the long trestle and broderson creek and through the open country between the two ranches of los muertos and quien sabe
but to go on to bonneville meant certain death
before as well as behind him the roads were now blocked
once more he thought of the mountains
he resolved to abandon the engine and make another final attempt to get into the shelter of the hills in the northernmost corner of quien sabe
he set his teeth
he would not give in
there was one more fight left in him yet
now to try the final hope
he slowed the engine down and reloading his revolver jumped from the platform to the road
he looked about him listening
all around him widened an ocean of wheat
there was no one in sight
the released engine alone unattended drew slowly away from him jolting ponderously over the rail joints
as he watched it go a certain indefinite sense of abandonment even in that moment came over dyke
his last friend that also had been his first was leaving him
he remembered that day long ago when he had opened the throttle of his first machine it was leaving him alone his last friend turning against him
slowly it was going back towards bonneville to the shops of the railroad the camp of the enemy that enemy that had ruined him and wrecked him
for the last time in his life he had been the engineer
now once more he became the highwayman the outlaw against whom all hands were raised the fugitive skulking in the mountains listening for the cry of dogs
but he would not give in
they had not broken him yet
never while he could fight would he allow behrman the triumph of his capture
he found his wound was not bad
he plunged into the wheat on quien sabe making northward for a division house that rose with its surrounding trees out of the wheat like an island
he reached it the blood squelching in his shoes
but the sight of two men portuguese farmhands staring at him from an angle of the barn abruptly roused him to action
he sprang forward with peremptory commands demanding a horse
at guadalajara delaney and the sheriff descended from the freight engine
horses now declared the sheriff
he wonot go into bonneville thats certain leave the engine between here and there and strike off into the country follow after him now in the saddle
soon as he leaves his engine on foot as good as got him now
their horses including even the buckskin mare that dyke had ridden were still at the station
the party swung themselves up delaney exclaiming mount as he bestrode the buckskin
at guadalajara the two bloodhounds were picked up again
urging the jaded horses to a gallop the party set off along the upper road keeping a sharp lookout to right and left for traces of abandonment of the engine
three miles beyond the long trestle they found behrman holding his saddle horse by the bridle and looking attentively at a trail that had been broken through the standing wheat on quien sabe
the party drew rein
the engine passed me on the tracks further up and empty said behrman
boys i think he left her here
but before anyone could answer the bloodhounds gave tongue again as they picked up the scent him cried behrman
get on boys
they dashed forward following the hounds
behrman laboriously climbed to his saddle panting perspiring mopping the roll of fat over his coat collar and turned in after them trotting along far in the rear his great stomach and tremulous jowl shaking with the horses gait
what a day he murmured
what a day trail was fresh and was followed as easily as if made on newfallen snow
in a short time the posse swept into the open space around the division house
the two portuguese were still there wideeyed terribly excited
yes yes dyke had been there not half an hour since had held them up taken a horse and galloped to the northeast towards the foothills at the headwaters of broderson creek
on again at full gallop through the young wheat trampling it under the flying hoofs the hounds hot on the scent baying continually the men on fresh mounts secured at the division house bending forward in their saddles spurring relentlessly
behrman jolted along far in the rear
and even then harried through an open country where there was no place to hide it was a matter of amazement how long a chase the highwayman led them
fences were passed fences whose barbed wire had been slashed apart by the fugitives knife
the ground rose under foot the hills were at hand still the pursuit held on
the sun long past the meridian began to turn earthward
would night come on before they were up with him
look
look
there he is
quick there he goes
high on the bare slope of the nearest hill all the posse looking in the direction of gesture saw the figure of a horseman emerge from an arroyo filled with chaparral and struggle at a labouring gallop straight up the slope
suddenly every member of the party shouted aloud
the horse had fallen pitching the rider from the saddle
the man rose to his feet caught at the bridle missed it and the horse dashed on alone
the man pausing for a second looked around saw the chase drawing nearer then turning back disappeared in the chaparral
delaney raised a great whoop got you now
into the slopes and valleys of the hills dashed the band of horsemen the trail now so fresh that it could be easily discerned by all
on and on it led them a furious wild scramble straight up the slopes
the minutes went by
the dry bed of a rivulet was passed then another fence then a tangle of manzanita a meadow of wild oats full of agitated cattle then an arroyo thick with chaparral and scrub oaks and then without warning the pistol shots ripped out and ran from rider to rider with the rapidity of a gatling discharge and one of the deputies bent forward in the saddle both hands to his face the blood jetting from between his fingers
dyke was there at bay at last his back against a bank of rock the roots of a fallen tree serving him as a rampart his revolver smoking in his hand under arrest dyke cried the sheriff not the least use to fight
the whole country is up
dyke fired again the shot splintering the foreleg of the horse the sheriff rode
the posse four men all wounded deputy having crawled out of the fight after first back after the preliminary fusillade dismounted and took shelter behind rocks and trees
on that rugged ground fighting from the saddle was impracticable
dyke in the meanwhile held his fire for he knew that once his pistol was empty he would never be allowed time to reload
dyke called the sheriff again for the last time i summon you to surrender
dyke did not reply
the sheriff delaney and the man named christian conferred together in a low voice
then delaney and christian left the others making a wide detour up the sides of the arroyo to gain a position to the left and somewhat to the rear of dyke
but it was at this moment that behrman arrived
it could not be said whether it was courage or carelessness that brought the agent within reach of revolver
possibly he was really a brave man possibly occupied with keeping an uncertain seat upon the back of his labouring scrambling horse he had not noticed that he was so close upon that scene of battle
he certainly did not observe the posse lying upon the ground behind sheltering rocks and trees and before anyone could call a warning he had ridden out into the open within thirty paces of intrenchment
dyke saw
there was the archenemy the man of all men whom he most hated the man who had ruined him who had exasperated him and driven him to crime and who had instigated tireless pursuit through all those past terrible weeks
suddenly inviting death he leaped up and forward he had forgotten all else all other considerations at the sight of this man
he would die gladly so only that behrman died before him got anyway he shouted as he ran forward
the muzzle of the weapon was not ten feet from huge stomach as dyke drew the trigger
had the cartridge exploded death certain and swift would have followed but at this of all moments the revolver missed fire
behrman with an unexpected agility leaped from the saddle and keeping his horse between him and dyke ran dodging and ducking from tree to tree
his first shot a failure dyke fired again and again at his enemy emptying his revolver reckless of consequences
his every shot went wild and before he could draw his knife the whole posse was upon him
without concerted plans obeying no signal but the promptings of the impulse that snatched unerring at men delaney and christian from one side the sheriff and the deputy from the other rushed in
they did not fire
it was dyke alive they wanted
one of them had a riata snatched from a saddlepommel and with this they tried to bind him
the fight was four to men with law on their side to one wounded freebooter halfstarved exhausted by days and nights of pursuit worn down with loss of sleep thirst privation and the grinding nerveracking consciousness of an everpresent peril
they swarmed upon him from all sides gripping at his legs at his arms his throat his head striking clutching kicking falling to the ground rolling over and over now under now above now staggering forward now toppling back
still dyke fought
through that scrambling struggling group through that maze of twisting bodies twining arms straining legs behrman saw him from moment to moment his face flaming his eyes bloodshot his hair matted with sweat
now he was down pinned under two men across his legs and now halfway up again struggling to one knee
then upright again with half his enemies hanging on his back
his colossal strength seemed doubled when his arms were held he fought bulllike with his head
a score of times it seemed as if they were about to secure him finally and irrevocably and then he would free an arm a leg a shoulder and the group that for the fraction of an instant had settled locked and rigid on its prey would break up again as he flung a man from him reeling and bloody and he himself twisting squirming dodging his great fists working like pistons backed away dragging and carrying the others with him
more than once he loosened almost every grip and for an instant stood nearly free panting rolling his eyes his clothes torn from his body bleeding dripping with sweat a terrible figure nearly free
the sheriff under his breath uttered an exclamation by god hell get away yet
behrman watched the fight complacently
that all may show obstinacy he commented but it donot show common sense
yet however dyke might throw off the clutches and fettering embraces that encircled him however he might disintegrate and scatter the band of foes that heaped themselves upon him however he might gain one instant of comparative liberty some one of his assailants always hung doggedly blindly to an arm a leg or a foot and the others drawing a seconds breath closed in again implacable unconquerable ferocious like hounds upon a wolf
at length two of the men managed to bring wrists close enough together to allow the sheriff to snap the handcuffs on
even then dyke clasping his hands and using the handcuffs themselves as a weapon knocked down delaney by the crushing impact of the steel bracelets upon the forehead
but he could no longer protect himself from attacks from behind and the riata was finally passed around his body pinioning his arms to his sides
after this it was useless to resist
the wounded deputy sat with his back to a rock holding his broken jaw in both hands
the sheriffs horse with its splintered foreleg would have to be shot head was cut from temple to cheekbone
the right wrist of the sheriff was all but dislocated
the other deputy was so exhausted he had to be helped to his horse
but dyke was taken
he himself had suddenly lapsed into semiunconsciousness unable to walk
they sat him on the buckskin behrman supporting him the sheriff on foot leading the horse by the bridle
the little procession formed and descended from the hills turning in the direction of bonneville
a special train one car and an engine would be made up there and the highwayman would sleep in the visalia jail that night
delaney and behrman found themselves in the rear of the cavalcade as it moved off
the cowpuncher turned to his chief well captain he said still panting as he bound up his forehead him
osterman cut his wheat that summer before any of the other ranchers and as soon as his harvest was over organized a jackrabbit drive
like barndance it was to be an event in which all the countryside should take part
the drive was to begin on the most western division of the osterman ranch whence it would proceed towards the southeast crossing into the northern part of quien which annixter had sown no ending in the hills at the headwaters of broderson creek where a barbecue was to be held
early on the morning of the day of the drive as harran and presley were saddling their horses before the stables on los muertos the foreman phelps remarked was into town last night and i hear that christian has been after ruggles early and late to have him put him in possession here on los muertos and delaney is doing the same for quien sabe
it was this man christian the real estate broker and cousin of behrman one of the main actors in the drama of capture who had come forward as a purchaser of los muertos when the railroad had regraded its holdings on the ranches around bonneville
he claims of course phelps went on that when he bought los muertos of the railroad he was guaranteed possession and he wants the place in time for the harvest almost as thin muttered harran as he thrust the bit into his horses mouth as delaney buying home ranch
that slice of quien sabe according to the grading is worth about ten thousand dollars yes even fifteen and i donot believe delaney is worth the price of a good horse
why those people donot even try to preserve appearances
where would christian find the money to buy los muertos no one man in all bonneville rich enough to do it
damned rascals as if we didnot see that christian and delaney are right and left hands
well hell get em cut off he cried with sudden fierceness if he comes too near the machine
how is it harran asked presley as the two young men rode out of the stable yard how is it the railroad gang can do anything before the supreme court hands down a decision
well you know how they talk growled harran
they have claimed that the cases taken up to the supreme court were not test cases as claim they and that because neither annixter nor the governor appealed theyve lost their cases by default the rottenest kind of sharp practice but it wonot do any good
the league is too strong
they wonot dare move on us yet awhile
why pres the moment theyd try to jump any of these ranches around here they would have six hundred rifles cracking at them as quick as howdoyoudo
why it would take a regiment of soldiers to put any one of us off our land
no sir they know the league means business this time
as presley and harran trotted on along the county road they continually passed or overtook other horsemen or buggies carryalls buckboards or even farm wagons going in the same direction
these were full of the farming people from all the country round about bonneville on their way to the rabbit same people seen at the their sunday finest the girls in muslin frocks and garden hats the men with linen dusters over their black clothes the older women in prints and dotted calicoes
many of these latter had already taken off their day was very pinning them in newspapers stowed them under the seats
they tucked their handkerchiefs into the collars of their dresses or knotted them about their fat necks to keep out the dust
from the axle trees of the vehicles swung carefully covered buckets of galvanised iron in which the lunch was packed
the younger children the boys with great frilled collars the girls with illfitting shoes cramping their feet leaned from the sides of buggy and carryall eating bananas and macaroons staring about with oxlike stolidity
tied to the axles the dogs followed the horses hoofs with lolling tongues coated with dust
the california summer lay blanketwise and smothering over all the land
the hills bonedry were browned and parched
the grasses and wildoats sear and yellow snapped like glass filaments under foot
the roads the bordering fences even the lower leaves and branches of the trees were thick and grey with dust
all colour had been burned from the landscape except in the irrigated patches that in the waste of brown and dull yellow glowed like oases
the wheat now close to its maturity had turned from pale yellow to golden yellow and from that to brown
like a gigantic carpet it spread itself over all the land
there was nothing else to be seen but the limitless sea of wheat as far as the eye could reach dry rustling crisp and harsh in the rare breaths of hot wind out of the southeast
as harran and presley went along the county road the number of vehicles and riders increased
they overtook and passed hooven and his family in the formers farm wagon a saddled horse tied to the back board
the little dutchman wearing the old frock coat of magnus derrick and a new broadbrimmed straw hat sat on the front seat with mrs hooven
the little girl hilda and the older daughter minna were behind them on a board laid across the sides of the wagon
presley and harran stopped to shake hands
say cried hooven exhibiting an old but extremely well kept rifle say bei gott me i tek some schatz at dose rebbit you bedt
ven he hef shtop to run und sit oop soh bei der hind laigs on i oop mit der guhn undbing
i cetch um
the marshals wonot allow you to shoot bismarck observed presley looking at minna
hooven doubled up with merriment
ho dots hell of some fine joak
me he roared with delight beating his knee
to his notion the joke was irresistible
all day long he could be heard repeating it
und praicelie he say dose mairschell woand led you schoot bismarck und ach gott aindt i mineselluf one oaf dose mairschell
as the two friends rode on presley had in his mind the image of minna hooven very pretty in a clean gown of pink gingham a cheap straw sailor hat from a bonneville store on her blue black hair
he remembered her very pale face very red lips and eyes of greenish pretty girl certainly always trailing a group of men behind her
her love affairs were the talk of all los muertos hope that hooven girl wonot go to the bad presley said to harran
oh shes all right the other answered nothing vicious about minna and i guess shell marry that foreman on the ditch gang right enough
well as a matter of course shes a good girl presley hastened to reply only shes too pretty for a poor girl and too sure of her prettiness besides the kind he continued who would find it pretty easy to go wrong if they lived in a city
around was a veritable throng
saddle horses and buggies by the score were clustered underneath the shed or hitched to the railings in front of the watering trough
three of portuguese tenants and a couple of workmen from the railroad shops in bonneville were on the porch already very drunk
continually young men singly or in groups came from the doorway wiping their lips with sidelong gestures of the hand
the whole place exhaled the febrile bustle of the saloon on a holiday morning
the procession of teams streamed on through bonneville reenforced at every street corner
along the upper road from quien sabe and guadalajara came fresh auxiliaries spanishmexicans from the town young men on capering horses darkeyed girls and matrons in red and black and yellow more portuguese in brandnew overalls smoking long thin cigars
even father sarria appeared
look said presley there goes annixter and hilma got his buckskin back
the master of quien sabe in top laced boots and campaign hat a cigar in his teeth followed along beside the carryall
hilma and mrs derrick were on the back seat young vacca driving
harran and presley bowed taking off their hats
hello hello pres cried annixter over the heads of the intervening crowd standing up in his stirrups and waving a hand great day
what a mob hey
say when this thing is over and everybody starts to walk into the barbecue come and have lunch with us look for you you and harran
hello harran wheres the governor
he didnot come today harran shouted back as the crowd carried him further away from annixter
left him and old broderson at los muertos
the throng emerged into the open country again spreading out upon the osterman ranch
from all directions could be seen horses and buggies driving across the stubble converging upon the rendezvous
ranch house was left to the eastward the army of the guests hurrying it began to be where around a flag pole flying a red flag a vast crowd of buggies and horses was already forming
the marshals began to appear
hooven descending from the farm wagon pinned his white badge to his hat brim and mounted his horse
osterman in marvellous riding clothes of english pattern galloped up and down upon his best thoroughbred cracking jokes with everybody chaffing joshing his great mouth distended in a perpetual grin of amiability
stop here stop here he vociferated dashing along in front of presley and harran waving his crop
the procession came to a halt the horses heads pointing eastward
the line began to be formed
the marshals perspiring shouting fretting galloping about urging this one forward ordering this one back ranged the thousands of conveyances and cavaliers in a long line shaped like a wide open crescent
its wings under the command of lieutenants were slightly advanced
far out before its centre osterman took his place delighted beyond expression at his conspicuousness posing for the gallery making his horse dance
wail aindt dey gowun to gommence den bretty soohn exclaimed mrs hooven who had taken her husbands place on the forward seat of the wagon never was so warm murmured minna fanning herself with her hat
all seemed in readiness
for miles over the flat expanse of stubble curved the interminable lines of horses and vehicles
at a guess nearly five thousand people were present
the drive was one of the largest ever held
but no start was made immobilized the vast crescent stuck motionless under the blazing sun
here and there could be heard voices uplifted in jocular remonstrance
oh i say get a move on somebody aboard
say take root here pretty soon
some took malicious pleasure in starting false alarms
ah we go
off at last off
invariably these jokes fooled some one in the line
an old man or some old woman nervous hard of hearing always gathered up the reins and started off only to be hustled and ordered back into the line by the nearest marshal
this manoeuvre never failed to produce its effect of hilarity upon those near at hand
everybody laughed at the blunderer the joker jeering audibly
hey come back here
oh hes easy be in a hurry grandpa
say you want to drive all the rabbits yourself
later on a certain group of these fellows started a huge josh
say thats what were waiting for the dofunny the dofunny
sure you canot drive rabbits without the dofunny the dofunny
oh say she donot know what the dofunny is
we canot start without it sure
pete went back to get it
oh youre joking me theres no such thing
well arenot we for it
oh look look cried some women in a covered rig
see they are starting already way over there
in fact it did appear as if the far extremity of the line was in motion
dust rose in the air above it
they starting
why donot we start
no theyve stopped
false alarm not either
why donot we move
but as one or two began to move off the nearest marshal shouted wrathfully get back there get back there
well theyve started over there
get back i tell you the dofunny say were going to miss it all all started over there
a lieutenant came galloping along in front of the line shouting here whats the matter here
why donot you start
there was a great shout
everybody simultaneously uttered a prolonged off
here we go for sure this time
remember to keep the alignment roared the lieutenant go too fast
and the marshals rushing here and there on their sweating horses to points where the line bulged forward shouted waving their arms not too fast not too back keep closer together here
do you want to let all the rabbits run back between you
a great confused sound rose into the creaking of axles the jolt of iron tires over the dry clods the click of brittle stubble under the horses hoofs the barking of dogs the shouts of conversation and laughter
the entire line horses buggies wagons gigs dogs men and boys on foot and armed with clubs moved slowly across the fields sending up a cloud of white dust that hung above the scene like smoke
a brisk gaiety was in the air
everyone was in the best of humor calling from team to team laughing skylarking joshing
garnett of the ruby rancho and gethings of the san pablo both on horseback found themselves side by side
ignoring the drive and the spirit of the occasion they kept up a prolonged and serious conversation on an expected rise in the price of wheat
dabney also on horseback followed them listening attentively to every word but hazarding no remark
mrs derrick and hilma sat in the back seat of the carryall behind young vacca
mrs derrick a little disturbed by such a great concourse of people frightened at the idea of the killing of so many rabbits drew back in her place her younggirl eyes troubled and filled with a vague distress
hilma very much excited leaned from the carryall anxious to see everything watching for rabbits asking innumerable questions of annixter who rode at her side
the change that had been progressing in hilma ever since the night of the famous barndance now seemed to be approaching its climax first the girl then the woman last of all the mother
conscious dignity a new element in her character developed
the shrinking the timidity of the girl just awakening to the consciousness of sex passed away from her
the confusion the troublous complexity of the woman a mystery even to herself disappeared
motherhood dawned the old simplicity of her maiden days came back to her
it was no longer a simplicity of ignorance but of supreme knowledge the simplicity of the perfect the simplicity of greatness
she looked the world fearlessly in the eyes
at last the confusion of her ideas like frightened birds resettling adjusted itself and she emerged from the trouble calm serene entering into her divine right like a queen into the rule of a realm of perpetual peace
and with this with the knowledge that the crown hung poised above her head there came upon hilma a gentleness infinitely beautiful infinitely pathetic a sweetness that touched all who came near her with the softness of a caress
she moved surrounded by an invisible atmosphere of love
love was in her wideopened brown eyes dim reflection of that descending crown poised over her in a faint lustre from her dark thick hair
around her beautiful neck sloping to her shoulders with full graceful curves love lay encircled like a that was beyond words sweet breathed from her parted lips
from her white large arms downward to her pink an invisible electric fluid disengaged itself subtle alluring
in the velvety huskiness of her voice love vibrated like a note of unknown music
annixter her uncouth rugged husband living in this influence of a wife who was also a mother at all hours touched to the quick by this sense of nobility of gentleness and of love the instincts of a father already clutching and tugging at his heart was trembling on the verge of a mighty transformation
the hardness and inhumanity of the man was fast breaking up
one night returning late to the ranch house after a compulsory visit to the city he had come upon hilma asleep
he had never forgotten that night
a realization of his boundless happiness in this love he gave and received the thought that hilma him a knowledge of his own unworthiness a vast and humble thankfulness that his god had chosen him of all men for this great joy had brought him to his knees for the first time in all his troubled restless life of combat and aggression
he prayed he knew not words wordless thoughts resolving fiercely to do right to make some return for gift thus placed within his hands
where once annixter had thought only of himself he now thought only of hilma
the time when this thought of another should broaden and widen into thought of was yet to come but already it had expanded to include the unborn childalready as in the case of mrs dyke it had broadened to enfold another child and another mother bound to him by no ties other than those of humanity and pity
in time starting from this point it would reach out more and more till it should take in all men and all women and the intolerant selfish man while retaining all of his native strength should become tolerant and generous kind and forgiving
for the moment however the two natures struggled within him
a fight was to be fought one more the last the fiercest the attack of the enemy who menaced his very home and hearth was to be resisted
then peace attained arrested development would once more proceed
hilma looked from the carryall scanning the open plain in front of the advancing line of the drive
where are the rabbits she asked of annixter donot see any at all
they are way ahead of us yet he said
here take the glasses
he passed her his field glasses and she adjusted them
oh yes she cried see
i can see five or six but oh so far off
the beggars run way ahead at first should say so
see them specks
every now and then they sit up their ears straight up in the air
here look hilma there goes one close by
from out of the ground apparently some twenty yards distant a great jack sprang into view bounding away with tremendous leaps his blacktipped ears erect
he disappeared his grey body losing itself against the grey of the ground
oh a big fellow
hi yonders another
yes yes oh look at him run
from off the surface of the ground at first apparently empty of all life and seemingly unable to afford hiding place for so much as a fieldmouse jackrabbits started up at every moment as the line went forward
at first they appeared singly and at long intervals then in twos and threes as the drive continued to advance
they leaped across the plain and stopped in the distance sitting up with straight ears then ran on again were joined by others sank down flush to the ears flattened started up again ran to the side turned back once more darted away with incredible swiftness and were lost to view only to be replaced by a score of others
gradually the number of jacks to be seen over the expanse of stubble in front of the line of teams increased
their antics were infinite
no two acted precisely alike
some lay stubbornly close in a little depression between two clods till the horses hoofs were all but upon them then sprang out from their hidingplace at the last second
others ran forward but a few yards at a time refusing to take flight scenting a greater danger before them than behind
still others forced up at the last moment doubled with lightning alacrity in their tracks turning back to scuttle between the teams taking desperate chances
as often as this occurred it was the signal for a great uproar let him get through don let him get through
look out for him there he goes
horns were blown bells rung tin pans clamorously beaten
either the jack escaped or confused by the noise darted back again fleeing away as if his life depended on the issue of the instant
once even a bewildered rabbit jumped fair into mrs lap as she sat in the carryall and was out again like a flash
poor frightened thing she exclaimed and for a long time afterward she retained upon her knees the sensation of the four little paws quivering with excitement and the feel of the trembling furry body with its wildly beating heart pressed against her own
by noon the number of rabbits discernible by field glasses on ahead was far into the thousands
what seemed to be ground resolved itself when seen through the glasses into a maze of small moving bodies leaping ducking doubling running back and wilderness of agitated ears white tails and twinkling legs
the outside wings of the curved line of vehicles began to draw in a little ranch was left behind the drive continued on over quien sabe
as the day advanced the rabbits singularly enough became less wild
when flushed they no longer ran so far nor so fast limping off instead a few feet at a time and crouching down their ears close upon their backs
thus it was that by degrees the teams began to close up on the main herd
at every instant the numbers increased
it was no longer thousands it was tens of thousands
the earth was alive with rabbits
denser and denser grew the throng
in all directions nothing was to be seen but the loose mass of the moving jacks
the horns of the crescent of teams began to contract
far off the corral came into sight
the disintegrated mass of rabbits commenced as it were to solidify to coagulate
at first each jack was some three feet distant from his nearest neighbor but this space diminished to two feet then to one then to but a few inches
the rabbits began leaping over one another
then the strange scene defined itself
it was no longer a herd covering the earth
it was a sea whipped into confusion tossing incessantly leaping falling agitated by unseen forces
at times the unexpected tameness of the rabbits all at once vanished
throughout certain portions of the herd eddies of terror abruptly burst forth
a panic spread then there would ensue a blind wild rushing together of thousands of crowded bodies and a furious scrambling over backs till the scuffing thud of innumerable feet over the earth rose to a reverberating murmur as of distant thunder here and there pierced by the strange wild cry of the rabbit in distress
the line of vehicles was halted
to go forward now meant to trample the rabbits under foot
the drive came to a standstill while the herd entered the corral
this took time for the rabbits were by now too crowded to run
however like an opened sluicegate the extending flanks of the entrance of the corral slowly engulfed the herd
the mass packed tight as ever by degrees diminished precisely as a pool of water when a dam is opened
the last stragglers went in with a rush and the gate was dropped
come just have a lock in here called annixter
hilma descending from the carryall and joined by presley and harran approached and looked over the high board fence
oh did you ever see anything like that she exclaimed
the corral a really large enclosure had proved all too small for the number of rabbits collected by the drive
inside it was a living moving leaping breathing twisting mass
the rabbits were packed two three and four feet deep
they were in constant movement those beneath struggling to the top those on top sinking and disappearing below their fellows
all wildness all fear of man seemed to have entirely disappeared
men and boys reaching over the sides of the corral picked up a jack in each hand holding them by the ears while two reporters from san francisco papers took photographs of the scene
the noise made by the tens of thousands of moving bodies was as the noise of wind in a forest while from the hot and sweating mass there rose a strange odor penetrating ammoniacal savouring of wild life
on signal the killing began
dogs that had been brought there for that purpose when let into the corral refused as had been half expected to do the work
they snuffed curiously at the pile then backed off disturbed perplexed
but the men and for the most more eager
annixter drew hilma away and indeed most of the people set about the barbecue at once
in the corral however the killing went forward
armed with a club in each hand the young fellows from guadalajara and bonneville and the farm boys from the ranches leaped over the rails of the corral
they walked unsteadily upon the myriad of crowding bodies underfoot or as space was cleared sank almost waist deep into the mass that leaped and squirmed about them
blindly furiously they struck and struck
the anglosaxon spectators round about drew back in disgust but the hot degenerated blood of portuguese mexican and mixed spaniard boiled up in excitement at this wholesale slaughter
but only a few of the participants of the drive cared to look on
all the guests betook themselves some quarter of a mile farther on into the hills
the picnic and barbecue were to be held around the spring where broderson creek took its rise
already two entire beeves were roasting there teams were hitched saddles removed and men women and children a great throng spread out under the shade of the live oaks
a vast confused clamour rose in the air a babel of talk a clatter of tin plates of knives and forks
bottles were uncorked napkins and oilcloths spread over the ground
the men lit pipes and cigars the women seized the occasion to nurse their babies
osterman ubiquitous as ever resplendent in his boots and english riding breeches moved about between the groups keeping up an endless flow of talk cracking jokes winking nudging gesturing putting his tongue in his cheek never at a loss for a reply playing the goat
that josher osterman always at his monkeyshines but a good fellow for all that brainy too
nothing stuck up about him either like magnus derrick
everything all right buck inquired osterman coming up to where annixter hilma and mrs derrick were sitting down to their lunch
yes yes everything right
but weve no corkscrew
no scarecrow
here you are and he drew from his pocket a silverplated jackknife with a corkscrew attachment
harran and presley came up bearing between them a great smoking roasted portion of beef just off the fire
hilma hastened to put forward a huge china platter
osterman had a joke to crack with the two boys a joke that was rather broad but as he turned about the words almost on his lips his glance fell upon hilma herself whom he had not seen for more than two months
she had handed presley the platter and was now sitting with her back against the tree between two boles of the roots
the position was a little elevated and the supporting roots on either side of her were like the arms of a great chair of state
she sat thus as on a throne raised above the rest the radiance of the unseen crown of motherhood glowing from her forehead the beauty of the perfect woman surrounding her like a glory
and the josh died away on lips and unconsciously and swiftly he bared his head
something was passing there in the air about him that he did not understand something however that imposed reverence and profound respect
for the first time in his life embarrassment seized upon him upon this joker this wearer of clothes this teller of funny stories with his large red ears bald head and comic actors face
he stammered confusedly and took himself away for the moment abstracted serious lost in thought
by now everyone was eating
it was the feeding of the people elemental gross a great appeasing of appetite an enormous quenching of thirst
quarters of beef roasts ribs shoulders haunches were consumed loaves of bread by the thousands disappeared whole barrels of wine went down the dry and dusty throats of the multitude
conversation lagged while the people ate while hunger was appeased
everybody had their fill
one ate for the sake of eating resolved that there should be nothing left considering it a matter of pride to exhibit a clean plate
after dinner preparations were made for games
on a flat plateau at the top of one of the hills the contestants were to strive
there was to be a footrace of young girls under seventeen a fat mens race the younger fellows were to put the shot to compete in the running broad jump and the standing high jump in the hop skip and step and in wrestling
presley was delighted with it all
it was homeric this feasting this vast consuming of meat and bread and wine followed now by games of strength
an epic simplicity and directness an honest anglosaxon mirth and innocence commended it
crude it was coarse it was but no taint of viciousness was here
these people were good people kindly benignant even always readier to give than to receive always more willing to help than to be helped
they were good stock
of such was the backbone of the americans everyone of them
where else in the world round were such strong honest men such strong beautiful women
annixter harran and presley climbed to the level plateau where the games were to be held to lay out the courses and mark the distances
it was the very place where once presley had loved to lounge entire afternoons reading his books of poems smoking and dozing
from this high point one dominated the entire valley to the south and west
the view was superb
the three men paused for a moment on the crest of the hill to consider it
young vacca came running and panting up the hill after them calling for annixter
well well what is it
mr looking for you sir you and mr harran
vanamee that cowboy over at has just come from the governor with a message
i guess its important
hello whats up now muttered annixter as they turned back
they found osterman saddling his horse in furious haste him was vanamee holding by the bridle an animal that was one lather of sweat
a few of the picnickers were turning their heads curiously in that direction
evidently something of moment was in the wind all up demanded annixter as he and harran followed by presley drew near hell to pay exclaimed osterman under his breath
read that
vanamee just brought it
he handed annixter a sheet of note paper and turned again to the cinching of his saddle got to be quick he cried stolen a march on us
annixter read the note harran and presley looking over his shoulder
ah its them is it exclaimed annixter
harran set his teeth
now for it he exclaimed been to your place already mr annixter said vanamee passed by it on my way up
they have put delaney in possession and have set all your furniture out in the road
annixter turned about his lips white
already presley and harran had run to their horses
vacca cried annixter vacca
put the saddle on the buckskin osterman get as many of the league as are here together at spot understand be back in a minute
i must tell hilma this
hooven ran up as annixter disappeared
his little eyes were blazing he was dragging his horse with him
say dose fellers come hey
me alretty see i hev der guhn jumped the ranch little girl said annixter putting one arm around hilma in our house now off
go to and wait for me there
she put her arms around his neck going she demanded must be frightened
it will be all right
go to andgoodbye
she said never a word
she looked once long into his eyes then kissed him on the mouth
meanwhile the news had spread
the multitude rose to its feet
women and men with pale faces looked at each other speechless or broke forth into inarticulate exclamations
a strange unfamiliar murmur took the place of the tumultuous gaiety of the previous moments
a sense of dread of confusion of impending terror weighed heavily in the air
what was now to happen
when annixter got back to osterman he found a number of the leaguers already assembled
they were all mounted
hooven was there and harran and besides these garnett of the ruby ranch and gethings of the san pablo phelps the foreman of los muertos and last of all dabney silent as ever speaking to no one
presley came riding up
best keep out of this pres cried annixter
are we ready exclaimed gethings
ready ready were all here
is this all of us cried annixter
where are the six hundred men who were going to rise when this happened
they had wavered these other leaguers
now when the actual crisis impended they were smitten with confusion
ah no they were not going to stand up and be shot at just to save land
they were not armed
what did annixter and osterman take them for
no sir the railroad had stolen a march on them
after all his big talk derrick had allowed them to be taken by surprise
the only thing to do was to call a meeting of the executive committee
that was the only thing
as for going down there with no weapons in their hands sir
that was asking a little much
come on then boys shouted osterman turning his back on the others
the governor says to meet him at make for the long trestle and strike the trail to there
they set off
it was a terrible ride
twice during the scrambling descent from the hills pony fell beneath him
annixter on his buckskin and osterman on his thoroughbred good horsemen both led the others setting a terrific pace
the hills were left behind
broderson creek was crossed and on the levels of quien sabe straight through the standing wheat the nine horses flogged and spurred stretched out to their utmost
their passage through the wheat sounded like the rip and tear of a gigantic web of cloth
the landscape on either hand resolved itself into a long blur
tears came to the eyes flying pebbles clods of earth grains of wheat flung up in the flight stung the face like shot thoroughbred took the second crossing of creek in a single leap
down under the long trestle tore the cavalcade in a shower of mud and gravel up again on the further bank the horses blowing like steam engines on into the trail to single file now pony lagging horse bleeding at the eyes the buckskin game as a fighting cock catching her second wind far in the lead now distancing even the english thoroughbred that osterman rode
at last unpainted house beneath the enormous live oak tree came in sight
across the lower road breaking through fences and into the yard around the house thundered the leaguers
magnus was waiting for them
the riders dismounted hardly less exhausted than their horses
why wheres all the men
annixter demanded of magnus
broderson is here and cutter replied the governor no one else
i thought would bring more men with you
there are only nine of us
and the six hundred leaguers who were going to rise when this happened exclaimed garnett bitterly
rot the league cried annixter gone to to pieces at the first touch
we have been taken by surprise gentlemen after all said magnus
totally off our guard
but there are eleven of us
it is enough
well whats the game
has the marshal come
how many men are with him
the united states marshal from san francisco explained magnus came down early this morning and stopped at guadalajara
we learned it all through our friends in bonneville about an hour ago they telephoned me and mr broderson
behrman met him and provided about a dozen deputies
delaney ruggles and christian joined them at guadalajara
they left guadalajara going towards mr ranch house on quien sabe
they are serving the writs in ejectment and putting the dummy buyers in possession
they are armed
behrman is with them
where are they now
cutter is watching them from the long trestle
they returned to guadalajara
they are there now
well observed gethings from guadalajara they can only go to two places
either they will take the upper road and go on to next or they will take the lower road to mr that is as i supposed said magnus
that is why i wanted you to come here
from here we can watch both roads simultaneously
is anybody on the lookout on the upper road
cutter
he is on the long trestle
say observed hooven the instincts of the oldtime soldier stirring him say dose feller pretty demn schmart i tink
we got to put some picket way oudt bei der lower roadt alzoh und he tek dose glassus got bei um
say look at dose irregation ditsch
dot ditsch he run righd across dose road hey some fine entrenchment you bedt
we fighd um from dose ditsch
in fact the dry irrigating ditch was a natural trench admirably suited to the purpose crossing both roads as hooven pointed out and barring approach from guadalajara to all the ranches save had already been seized
gethings departed to join cutter on the long trestle while phelps and harran taking field glasses with them and mounting their horses went out towards guadalajara on the lower road to watch for the marshals approach from that direction
after the outposts had left them the party in cottage looked to their weapons
long since every member of the league had been in the habit of carrying his revolver with him
they were all armed and in addition hooven had his rifle
presley alone carried no weapon
the main room of house in which the leaguers were now assembled was barren povertystricken but tolerably clean
an old clock ticked vociferously on a shelf
in one corner was a bed with a patched faded quilt
in the centre of the room straddling over the bare floor stood a pine table
around this the men gathered two or three occupying chairs annixter sitting sideways on the table the rest standing believe gentlemen said magnus that we can go through this day without bloodshed
i believe not one shot need be fired
the railroad will not force the issue will not bring about actual fighting
when the marshal realises that we are thoroughly in earnest thoroughly determined i am convinced that he will withdraw
there were murmurs of assent
look here said annixter if this thing can by any means be settled peaceably i say lets do it so long as we donot give in
the others stared
was this annixter who hotspur of the league the quarrelsome irascible fellow who loved and sought a quarrel
was it annixter who now had been the first and only one of them all to suffer whose ranch had been seized whose household possessions had been flung out into the road
when you come right down to it he continued killing a man no matter what hes done to you is a serious business
i propose we make one more attempt to stave this thing off see if we canot get to talk with the marshal himself at any rate warn him of the danger of going any further
boys lets not fire the first shot
what do you say
the others agreed unanimously and promptly and old broderson tugging uneasily at his long beard added violence no violence that is
i should hate to have innocent blood on my is if it innocent
i donot know that he is he had innocent blood on head
that dyke affair terrible terrible but then dyke in the to it though the railroad did drive him to it
i want to be fair and just to everybody a team coming up the road from los muertos announced presley from the door
fair and just to everybody murmured old broderson wagging his head frowning perplexedly donot want harm anybody unless they harm me
is the team going towards guadalajara enquired garnett getting up and coming to the door
yes its a portuguese one of the garden truck men
we must turn him back declared osterman
he canot go through here
we donot want him to take any news on to the marshal and behrman turn him back said presley
he rode out towards the market cart and the others watching from the road in front of saw him halt it
an excited interview followed
they could hear the portuguese expostulating volubly but in the end he turned back
martial law on los muertos isnot it observed osterman
steady all he exclaimed as he turned about here comes harran
harran rode up at a gallop
the others surrounded him saw them he cried
they are coming this way
behrman and ruggles are in a twohorse buggy
all the others are on horseback
there are eleven of them
christian and delaney are with them
those two have rifles
i left hooven watching them
better call in gethings and cutter right away said annixter need all our men call them in presley volunteered at once
can i have the buckskin
my pony is about done up
he departed at a brisk gallop but on the way met gethings and cutter returning
they too from their elevated position had observed the marshals party leaving guadalajara by the lower road
presley told them of the decision of the leaguers not to fire until fired upon
all right said gethings
but if it comes to a gunfight that means its all up with at least one of us
delaney never misses his man
when they reached again they found that the leaguers had already taken their position in the ditch
the plank bridge across it had been torn up
magnus two long revolvers lying on the embankment in front of him was in the middle harran at his side
on either side some five feet intervening between each man stood the other leaguers their revolvers ready
dabney the silent old man had taken off his coat
take your places between mr osterman and mr broderson said magnus as the three men rode up
presley he added forbid you to take any part in this affair
yes keep him out of it cried annixter from his position at the extreme end of the line
go back to house pres and look after the horses he added
this is no business of yours
and keep the road behind us clear let come near not understand
presley withdrew leading the buckskin and the horses that gethings and cutter had ridden
he fastened them under the great live oak and then came out and stood in the road in front of the house to watch what was going on
in the ditch shoulder deep the leaguers ready watchful waited in silence their eyes fixed on the white shimmer of the road leading to guadalajara
hooven enquired cutter donot know osterman replied
he was out watching the lower road with harran derrick
oh harran he called hooven coming in donot know what he is waiting for answered harran
he was to have come in just after me
he thought maybe the marshals party might make a feint in this direction then go around by the upper road after all
he wanted to watch them a little longer
but he ought to be here now
think hell take a shot at them on his own account
oh no he wouldnot do that
maybe they took him prisoner
well thats to be thought of too
suddenly there was a cry
around the bend of the road in front of them came a cloud of dust
from it emerged a horses head
hello hello theres something
remember we are not to fire first
perhaps thats hooven i canot see
is it
there only seems to be one horse
too much dust for one horse
annixter who had taken his field glasses from harran adjusted them to his eyes not them he announced presently nor hooven either a cart
then after another moment he added the butchers cart from guadalajara
the tension was relaxed
the men drew long breaths settling back in their places
do we let him go on governor
the bridge is down
he canot go by and we must not let him go back
we shall have to detain him and question him
i wonder the marshal let him pass
the cart approached at a lively trot
anybody else in that cart mr annixter asked magnus
look carefully
it may be a ruse
it is strange the marshal should have let him pass
the leaguers roused themselves again
osterman laid his hand on his revolver
no called annixter in another instant no theres only one man in it
the cart came up and cutter and phelps clambering from the ditch stopped it as it arrived in front of the party exclaimed the young butcher pulling up
is that bridge broke
but at the idea of being held the boy protested at top voice badly frightened bewildered not knowing what was to happen next
no no i got my meat to deliver
say you let me go
say i ainot got nothing to do with you
he tugged at the reins trying to turn the cart about
cutter with his jackknife parted the reins just back of the bit stay where you are m son for a while not going to hurt you
but you are not going back to town till we say so
did you pass anybody on the road out of town
in reply to the leaguers questions the young butcher at last told them he had passed a twohorse buggy and a lot of men on horseback just beyond the railroad tracks
they were headed for los muertos them all right muttered annixter coming by this road sure
the butchers horse and cart were led to one side of the road and the horse tied to the fence with one of the severed lines
the butcher himself was passed over to presley who locked him in barn
well what the devil demanded osterman has become of bismarck
in fact the butcher had seen nothing of hooven
the minutes were passing and still he failed to appear he up to anyways
bet you what you like they caught him
just like that crazy dutchman to get excited and go too near
you can always depend on hooven to lose his head
five minutes passed then ten
the road towards guadalajara lay empty baking and white under the sun
well the marshal and behrman donot seem to be in any hurry either
shall i go forward and reconnoitre governor asked harran
but dabney who stood next to annixter touched him on the shoulder and without speaking pointed down the road
annixter looked then suddenly cried out here comes hooven
the german galloped into sight around the turn of the road his rifle laid across his saddle
he came on rapidly pulled up and dismounted at the ditch commen he cried trembling with excitement watch um long dime bei der side oaf der roadt in der busches
dey shtop bei der gate oder side der relroadt trecks and talk long dime mit one nudder
den dey gome on gowun sure do zum monkeydoodle pizeness
me i see gritschun put der kertridges in his guhn
i tink dey gowun to gome blace first
dey gowun to try put me off tek my home bei gott
all right get down in here and keep quiet hooven fire unless here they are
a halfdozen voices uttered the cry at once
there could be no mistake this time
a buggy drawn by two horses came into view around the curve of the road
three riders accompanied it and behind these seen at intervals in a cloud of dust were others
this then was behrman with the united states marshal and his posse
the event that had been so long in preparation the event which it had been said would never come to pass the last trial of strength the last fight between the trust and the people the direct brutal grapple of armed men the law defied the government ignored behold here it was close at hand
osterman cocked his revolver and in the profound silence that had fallen upon the scene the click was plainly audible from end to end of the line
remember our agreement gentlemen cried magnus in a warning voice
mr osterman i must ask you to let down the hammer of your weapon
no one answered
in absolute quiet standing motionless in their places the leaguers watched the approach of the marshal
five minutes passed
the riders came on steadily
they drew nearer
the grind of the buggy wheels in the grit and dust of the road and the prolonged clatter of the horses feet began to make itself heard
the leaguers could distinguish the faces of their enemies
in the buggy were behrman and cyrus ruggles the latter driving
a tall man in a frock coat and slouched marshal beyond at the left of the buggy delaney carrying a winchester at the right
christian the real estate broker cousin also with a rifle could be made out just behind the marshal
back of these riding well up was a group of horsemen indistinguishable in the dust raised by the buggys wheels
steadily the distance between the leaguers and the posse diminished let them get too close governor whispered harran
when buggy was about one hundred yards distant from the irrigating ditch magnus sprang out upon the road leaving his revolvers behind him
he beckoned garnett and gethings to follow and the three ranchers who with the exception of broderson were the oldest men present advanced without arms to meet the marshal
magnus cried aloud halt where you are
from their places in the ditch annixter osterman dabney harran hooven broderson cutter and phelps their hands laid upon their revolvers watched silently alert keen ready for anything
at the words they saw ruggles pull sharply on the reins
the buggy came to a standstill the riders doing likewise
magnus approached the marshal still followed by garnett and gethings and began to speak
his voice was audible to the men in the ditch but his words could not be made out
they heard the marshal reply quietly enough and the two shook hands
delaney came around from the side of the buggy his horse standing before the team across the road
he leaned from the saddle listening to what was being said but made no remark
from time to time behrman and ruggles from their seats in the buggy interposed a sentence or two into the conversation but at first so far as the leaguers could discern neither magnus nor the marshal paid them any attention
they saw however that the latter repeatedly shook his head and once they heard him exclaim in a loud voice only know my duty mr derrick
then gethings turned about and seeing delaney close at hand addressed an unheard remark to him
the cowpuncher replied curtly and the words seemed to anger gethings
he made a gesture pointing back to the ditch showing the intrenched leaguers to the posse
delaney appeared to communicate the news that the leaguers were on hand and prepared to resist to the other members of the party
they all looked toward the ditch and plainly saw the ranchers there standing to their arms
but meanwhile ruggles had addressed himself more directly to magnus and between the two an angry discussion was going forward
once even harran heard his father exclaim the statement is a lie and no one knows it better than yourself
here growled annixter to dabney who stood next him in the ditch those fellows are getting too close
look at them edging up
magnus see that
the other members of the marshals force had come forward from their places behind the buggy and were spread out across the road
some of them were gathered about magnus garnett and gethings and some were talking together looking and pointing towards the ditch
whether acting upon signal or not the leaguers in the ditch could not tell but it was certain that one or two of the posse had moved considerably forward
besides this delaney had now placed his horse between magnus and the ditch and two others riding up from the rear had followed his example
the posse surrounded the three ranchers and by now everybody was talking at once
look here harran called to annixter this wonot do
i donot like the looks of this thing
they all seem to be edging up and before we know it they may take the governor and the other men prisoners
they ought to come back declared annixter
somebody ought to tell them that those fellows are creeping up
by now the angry argument between the governor and ruggles had become more heated than ever
their voices were raised now and then they made furious gestures
they ought to come back cried osterman
we couldnot shoot now if anything should happen for fear of hitting them
well it sounds as though something were going to happen pretty soon
they could hear gethings and delaney wrangling furiously another deputy joined in going to call the governor back exclaimed annixter suddenly clambering out of the ditch
no no cried osterman keep in the ditch
they canot drive us out if we keep here
hooven and harran who had instinctively followed annixter hesitated at words and the three halted irresolutely on the road before the ditch their weapons in their hands
governor shouted harran come on back
you canot do anything
still the wrangle continued and one of the deputies advancing a little from out the group cried out keep back there
keep back there you
go to hell will you shouted harran on the instant on my land
oh come back here harran called osterman
that ainot going to do any good suddenly exclaimed harran
the governor is calling us
come on going
osterman got out of the ditch and came forward catching harran by the arm and pulling him back
he didnot call get excited ruin everything
get back into the ditch again
but cutter phelps and the old man dabney misunderstanding what was happening and seeing osterman leave the ditch had followed his example
all the leaguers were now out of the ditch and a little way down the road hooven osterman annixter and harran in front dabney phelps and cutter coming up from behind
keep back you cried the deputy again
in the group around buggy gethings and delaney were yet quarrelling and the angry debate between magnus garnett and the marshal still continued
till this moment the real estate broker christian had taken no part in the argument but had kept himself in the rear of the buggy
now however he pushed forward
there was but little room for him to pass and as he rode by the buggy his horse scraped his flank against the hub of the wheel
the animal recoiled sharply and striking against garnett threw him to the ground horse stood between the buggy and the leaguers gathered on the road in front of the ditch the incident indistinctly seen by them was misinterpreted
garnett had not yet risen when hooven raised a great shout with the words he dropped to one knee and sighting his rifle carefully fired into the group of men around the buggy
instantly the revolvers and rifles seemed to go off of themselves
both sides deputies and leaguers opened fire simultaneously
at first it was nothing but a confused roar of explosions then the roar lapsed to an irregular quick succession of reports shot leaping after shot then a moments silence and last of all regular as clockticks three shots at exact intervals
then stillness
delaney shot through the stomach slid down from his horse and on his hands and knees crawled from the road into the standing wheat
christian fell backward from the saddle toward the buggy and hung suspended in that position his head and shoulders on the wheel one stiff leg still across his saddle
hooven in attempting to rise from his kneeling position received a rifle ball squarely in the throat and rolled forward upon his face
old broderson crying out oh theyve shot me boys staggered sideways his head bent his hands rigid at his sides and fell into the ditch
osterman blood running from his mouth and nose turned about and walked back
presley helped him across the irrigating ditch and osterman laid himself down his head on his folded arms
harran derrick dropped where he stood turning over on his face and lay motionless groaning terribly a pool of blood forming under his stomach
the old man dabney silent as ever received his death speechless
he fell to his knees got up again fell once more and died without a word
annixter instantly killed fell his length to the ground and lay without movement just as he had fallen one arm across his face
on their way to ranch house hilma and mrs derrick heard the sounds of distant firing
stop cried hilma laying her hand upon young arm
stop the horses
listen what was that
the carryall came to a halt and from far away across the rustling wheat came the faint rattle of rifles and revolvers
say cried vacca rolling his eyes oh say theyre fighting over there
mrs derrick put her hands over her face
fighting she cried oh oh its terrible
magnus is harran
where do you think it is demanded hilma over toward going
turn back
drive to quick
better not mrs annixter protested the young man
mr annixter said we were to go to better keep away from if theres trouble there
we wouldnot get there till its all over anyhow
yes yes lets go home cried mrs derrick afraid
oh hilma afraid
come with me to then
there where they are fighting
oh i couldnot canot
it would be all over before we got there as vacca says
sure repeated young vacca
drive to commanded hilma
if you wonot walk there
she threw off the laprobes preparing to descend
and you she exclaimed turning to mrs derrick how harran and your husband may in danger
grumbling vacca turned the carryall about and drove across the open fields till he reached the road to guadalajara just below the mission
hurry cried hilma
the horses started forward under the touch of the whip
the ranch houses of quien sabe came in sight
do you want to stop at the house inquired vacca over his shoulder
no no oh go the horses run
they dashed through the houses of the home ranch
oh oh cried hilma suddenly look look there
look what they have done
vacca pulled the horses up for the road in front of house was blocked
a vast confused heap of household effects was therechairs sofas pictures fixtures lamps little home had been gutted everything had been taken from it and ruthlessly flung out upon the road everything that she and her husband had bought during that wonderful week after their marriage
here was the white enamelled set of the bedroom furniture the three chairs washstand and bureau drawers falling out spilling their contents into the dust there were the white wool rugs of the sittingroom the flower stand with its pots all broken its flowers wilting the cracked goldfish globe the fishes already dead the rocking chair the sewing machine the great round table of yellow oak the lamp with its deep shade of crinkly red tissue paper the pretty tinted photographs that had hung on the choir boys with beautiful eyes the pensive young girls in pink pieces of wood carving that represented quails and ducks and last of all its curtains of crisp clean muslin cruelly torn and bed the wonderful canopied bed so brave and gay of which hilma had been so proud thrust out there into the common road torn from its place from the discreet intimacy of her bridal chamber violated profaned flung out into the dust and garish sunshine for all men to stare at a mockery and a shame
to hilma it was as though something of herself of her person had been thus exposed and degraded all that she held sacred pilloried gibbeted and exhibited to the worlds derision
tears of anguish sprang to her eyes a red flame of outraged modesty overspread her face
oh she cried a sob catching her throat oh how could they do it
but other fears intruded other greater terrors impended
go on she cried to vacca go on quickly
but vacca would go no further
he had seen what had escaped attention two men deputies no doubt on the porch of the ranch house
they held possession there and the evidence of the presence of the enemy in this raid upon quien sabe had daunted him
no he declared getting out of the carryall ainot going to take you anywhere where youre liable to get hurt
besides the roads blocked by all this stuff
you canot get the team by
hilma sprang from the carryall
come she said to mrs derrick
the older woman trembling hesitating faint with dread obeyed and hilma picking her way through and around the wreck of her home set off by the trail towards the long trestle and when she arrived she found the road in front of the house and indeed all the surrounding yard crowded with people
an overturned buggy lay on the side of the road in the distance its horses in a tangle of harness held by two or three men
she saw buckboard under the live oak and near it a second buggy which she recognised as belonging to a doctor in guadalajara
oh what has happened oh what has happened moaned mrs derrick
come repeated hilma
the young girl took her by the hand and together they pushed their way through the crowd of men and women and entered the yard
the throng gave way before the two women parting to right and left without a word
presley cried mrs derrick as she caught sight of him in the doorway of the house oh presley what has happened
is harran safe
is magnus safe
where are they go in mrs derrick said presley coming forward go in
where is my husband demanded hilma
presley turned away and steadied himself against the jamb of the door
hilma leaving mrs derrick entered the house
the front room was full of men
she was dimly conscious of cyrus ruggles and behrman both deadly pale talking earnestly and in whispers to cutter and phelps
there was a strange acrid odour of an unfamiliar drug in the air
on the table before her was a satchel surgical instruments rolls of bandages and a blue oblong paper box full of cotton
but above the hushed noises of voices and footsteps one terrible sound made itself prolonged rasping sound of breathing half choked laboured agonised
where is my husband she cried
she pushed the men aside
she saw magnus bareheaded three or four men lying on the floor one half naked his body swathed in white bandages the doctor in shirt sleeves on one knee beside a figure of a man stretched out beside him
garnett turned a white face to her
where is my husband
the other did not reply but stepped aside and hilma saw the dead body of her husband lying upon the bed
she did not cry out
she said no word
she went to the bed and sitting upon it took head in her lap holding it gently between her hands
thereafter she did not move but sat holding her dead husbands head in her lap looking vaguely about from face to face of those in the room while without a sob without a cry the great tears filled her wideopened eyes and rolled slowly down upon her cheeks
on hearing that his wife was outside magnus came quickly forward
she threw herself into his arms
tell me tell me she cried is we donot know yet he answered
oh annie then suddenly the governor checked himself
he the indomitable could not break down now
the doctor is with him he said we are doing all we can
try and be brave annie
there is always hope
this is a terrible days work
god forgive us all
she pressed forward but he held her back
no donot see him now
go into the next room
garnett take care of her
but she would not be denied
she pushed by magnus and breaking through the group that surrounded her son sank on her knees beside him moaning in compassion and terror
harran lay straight and rigid upon the floor his head propped by a pillow his coat that had been taken off spread over his chest
one leg of his trousers was soaked through and through with blood
his eyes were halfclosed and with the regularity of a machine the eyeballs twitched and twitched
his face was so white that it made his yellow hair look brown while from his opened mouth there issued that loud and terrible sound of guttering rasping laboured breathing that gagged and choked and gurgled with every inhalation
oh harrie harrie called mrs derrick catching at one of his hands
the doctor shook his head
he is unconscious mrs derrick
where was isthethe through the lungs
will he get well
tell me the truth donot know
mrs derrick
she had all but fainted and the old rancher garnett halfcarrying halfleading her took her to the one adjoining bedchamber
dazed numb with fear she sat down on the edge of the bed rocking herself back and forth murmuring harrie harrie oh my son my little boy
in the outside room presley came and went doing what he could to be of service sick with horror trembling from head to foot
the surviving members of both leaguers and warring factions of the railroad and the together now with no thought of hostility
presley helped the doctor to cover body
behrman and ruggles held bowls of water while osterman was attended to
the horror of that dreadful business had driven all other considerations from the mind
the sworn foes of the last hour had no thought of anything but to care for those whom in their fury they had shot down
the marshal abandoning for that day the attempt to serve the writs departed for san francisco
the bodies had been brought in from the road where they fell corpse had been laid upon the bed those of dabney and hooven whose wounds had all been in the face and head were covered with a tablecloth
upon the floor places were made for the others
cutter and ruggles rode into guadalajara to bring out the doctor there and to telephone to bonneville for others
osterman had not at any time since the shooting lost consciousness
he lay upon the floor of house bare to the waist bandages of adhesive tape reeved about his abdomen and shoulder
his eyes were halfclosed
presley who looked after him pending the arrival of a hack from bonneville that was to take him home knew that he was in agony
but this poser this silly fellow this cracker of jokes whom no one had ever taken very seriously at the last redeemed himself
when at length the doctor had arrived he had for the first time opened his eyes can wait he said
take harran first
and when at length his turn had come and while the sweat rolled from his forehead as the doctor began probing for the bullet he had reached out his free arm and taken hand in his gripping it harder and harder as the probe entered the wound
his breath came short through his nostrils his face the face of a comic actor with its high cheek bones bald forehead and salient ears grew paler and paler his great slit of a mouth shut tight but he uttered no groan
when the worst anguish was over and he could find breath to speak his first words had been were any of the others badly hurt
as presley stood by the door of the house after bringing in a pail of water for the doctor he was aware of a party of men who had struck off from the road on the other side of the irrigating ditch and were advancing cautiously into the field of wheat
he wondered what it meant and cutter coming up at that moment presley asked him if he knew
delaney said cutter
it seems that when he was shot he crawled off into the wheat
they are looking for him there
presley had forgotten all about the buster and had only a vague recollection of seeing him slide from his horse at the beginning of the fight
anxious to know what had become of him he hurried up and joined the party of searchers
we better look out said one of the young men how we go fooling around in here
if hes alive yet hes just as liable as not to think were after him and take a shot at us guess there ainot much fight left in him another answered
look at the wheat here
lord bled like a stuck pig his hat abruptly exclaimed the leader of the party
he canot be far off call him
they called repeatedly without getting any answer then proceeded cautiously
all at once the men in advance stopped so suddenly that those following carromed against them
there was an outburst of exclamation
here he is
good lord
sure thats him
poor fellow poor fellow
the cowpuncher lay on his back deep in the wheat his knees drawn up his eyes wide open his lips brown
rigidly gripped in one hand was his empty revolver
the men farm hands from the neighbouring ranches young fellows from guadalajara drew back in instinctive repulsion
one at length ventured near peering down into the face
is he dead inquired those in the rear donot know
well put your hand on his heart
no donot want to
what you afraid of
well i just donot want to touch him thats all bad luck feel his heart
you canot always tell by that
how can you tell then
pshaw you fellows make me sick
here let me get there do it
there was a long pause as the other bent down and laid his hand on the breast
well canot tell
sometimes i think i feel it beat and sometimes i donot
i never saw a dead man before
well you canot tell by the heart the good of talking so blame much
dead or not lets carry him back to the house
two or three ran back to the road for planks from the broken bridge
when they returned with these a litter was improvised and throwing their coats over the body the party carried it back to the road
the doctor was summoned and declared the cowpuncher to have been dead over half an hour
what did i tell you exclaimed one of the group
well i never said he wasnot dead protested the other only said you couldnot always tell by whether his heart beat or not
but all at once there was a commotion
the wagon containing mrs hooven minna and little hilda drove up
eh den my men cried mrs hooven wildly interrogating the faces of the crowd
whadt has happun
sey den dose vellers hev dey hurdt my men eh whadt
she sprang from the wagon followed by minna with hilda in her arms
the crowd bore back as they advanced staring at them in silence
eh whadt has happun whadt has happun wailed mrs hooven as she hurried on her two hands out before her the fingers spread wide
eh hooven eh my men are you alle righdt
she burst into the house body had been removed to an adjoining room the bedroom of the house and to this room mrs still at her heelsproceeded guided by an instinct born of the occasion
those in the outside room saying no word made way for them
they entered closing the door behind them and through all the rest of that terrible day no sound nor sight of them was had by those who crowded into and about that house of death
of all the main actors of the tragedy of the fight in the ditch they remained the least noted obtruded themselves the least upon the worlds observation
they were for the moment forgotten
but by now house was the centre of an enormous crowd
a vast concourse of people from bonneville from guadalajara from the ranches swelled by the thousands who had that morning participated in the rabbit drive surged about the place men and women young boys young girls farm hands villagers townspeople ranchers railroad employees mexicans spaniards portuguese
presley returning from the search for body had to fight his way to the house again
and from all this multitude there rose an indefinable murmur
as yet there was no menace in it no anger
it was confusion merely bewilderment the first longdrawn oh that greets the news of some great tragedy
the people had taken no thought as yet
curiosity was their dominant impulse
every one wanted to see what had been done failing that to hear of it and failing that to be near the scene of the affair
the crowd of people packed the road in front of the house for nearly a quarter of a mile in either direction
they balanced themselves upon the lower strands of the barbed wire fence in their effort to see over each others shoulders they stood on the seats of their carts buggies and farm wagons a few even upon the saddles of their riding horses
they crowded pushed struggled surged forward and back without knowing why converging incessantly upon house
when at length presley got to the gate he found a carryall drawn up before it
between the gate and the door of the house a lane had been formed and as he paused there a moment a group of leaguers among whom were garnett and gethings came slowly from the door carrying old broderson in their arms
the doctor bareheaded and in his shirt sleeves squinting in the sunlight attended them repeating at every step slow slow take it easy gentlemen
old broderson was unconscious
his face was not pale no bandages could be seen
with infinite precautions the men bore him to the carryall and deposited him on the back seat the rain flaps were let down on one side to shut off the gaze of the multitude
but at this point a moment of confusion ensued
presley because of half a dozen people who stood in his way could not see what was going on
there were exclamations hurried movements
the doctor uttered a sharp command and a man ran back to the house returning on the instant with the doctors satchel
by this time presley was close to the wheels of the carryall and could see the doctor inside the vehicle bending over old broderson
here it is here it is exclaimed the man who had been sent to the house wonot need it answered the doctor dying now
at the words a great hush widened throughout the throng near at hand
some men took off their hats
stand back protested the doctor quietly stand back good people please
the crowd bore back a little
in the silence a woman began to sob
the seconds passed then a minute
the horses of the carryall shifted their feet and whisked their tails driving off the flies
at length the doctor got down from the carryall letting down the rainflaps on that side as well
will somebody go home with the body he asked
gethings stepped forward and took his place by the driver
the carryall drove away
presley reentered the house
during his absence it had been cleared of all but one or two of the leaguers who had taken part in the fight
hilma still sat on the bed with head in her lap
behrman ruggles and all the railroad party had gone
osterman had been taken away in a hack and the tablecloth over body replaced with a sheet
but still unabated agonised raucous came the sounds of breathing
everything possible had already been done
for the moment it was out of the question to attempt to move him
his mother and father were at his side magnus with a face of stone his look fixed on those persistently twitching eyes annie derrick crouching at her sons side one of his hands in hers fanning his face continually with the crumpled sheet of an old newspaper
presley on tiptoes joined the group looking on attentively
one of the surgeons who had been called from bonneville stood close by watching face his arms folded
how is he
presley whispered
he wonot live the other responded
by degrees the choke and gurgle of the breathing became more irregular and the lids closed over the twitching eyes
all at once the breath ceased
magnus shot an inquiring glance at the surgeon
he is dead mr derrick the surgeon replied
annie derrick with a cry that rang through all the house stretched herself over the body of her son her head upon his breast and the great shoulders bowed never to rise again
god help me and forgive me he groaned
presley rushed from the house beside himself with grief with horror with pity and with mad insensate rage
on the porch outside caraher met him
is he began the saloonkeeper
yes hes dead cried presley all dead murdered shot down dead dead all of them
whose turn is next the way they killed my wife presley
caraher cried presley give me your hand been wrong all the time
the league is wrong
all the world is wrong
you are the only one of us all who is right with you from now on
i a in course of time a farm wagon from bonneville arrived at the bodies of annixter and harran were placed in it and it drove down the lower road towards the los muertos ranch houses
the bodies of delaney and christian had already been carried to guadalajara and thence taken by train to bonneville
hilma followed the farm wagon in the derricks carryall with magnus and his wife
during all that ride none of them spoke a word
it had been arranged that since quien sabe was in the hands of the railroad hilma should come to los muertos
to that place also body was carried
later on in the day when it was almost evening the undertakers black wagon passed the derricks home ranch on its way from and turned into the county road towards bonneville
the initial excitement of the affair of the irrigating ditch had died down the crowd long since had dispersed
by the time the wagon passed saloon the sun had set night was coming on
and the black wagon went on through the darkness unattended ignored solitary carrying the dead body of dabney the silent old man of whom nothing was known but his name who made no friends whom nobody knew or spoke to who had come from no one knew whence and who went no one knew whither
towards midnight of that same day mrs dyke was awakened by the sounds of groaning in the room next to hers
magnus derrick was not so occupied by death that he could not think of others who were in distress and when he had heard that mrs dyke and sidney like hilma had been turned out of quien sabe he had thrown open los muertos to them
though he warned them it is precarious hospitality at the best
until late mrs dyke had sat up with hilma comforting her as best she could rocking her to and fro in her arms crying with her trying to quiet her for once having given way to her grief hilma wept with a terrible anguish and a violence that racked her from head to foot and at last worn out a little child again had sobbed herself to sleep in the older womans arms and as a little child mrs dyke had put her to bed and had retired herself
aroused a few hours later by the sounds of a distress that was physical as well as mental mrs dyke hurried into room carrying the lamp with her
mrs dyke needed no enlightenment
she woke presley and besought him to telephone to bonneville at once summoning a doctor
that night hilma in great pain suffered a miscarriage
presley did not close his eyes once during the night he did not even remove his clothes
long after the doctor had departed and that house of tragedy had quieted down he still remained in his place by the open window of his little room looking off across the leagues of growing wheat watching the slow kindling of the dawn
horror weighed intolerably upon him
monstrous things huge terrible whose names he knew only too well whirled at a gallop through his imagination or rose spectral and grisly before the eyes of his mind
harran dead annixter dead broderson dead osterman perhaps even at that moment dying
why these men had made up his world
annixter had been his best friend harran his almost daily companion broderson and osterman were familiar to him as brothers
they were all his associates his good friends the group was his environment belonging to his daily life
and he standing there in the dust of the road by the irrigating ditch had seen them shot
he found himself suddenly at his table the candle burning at his elbow his journal before him writing swiftly the desire for expression the craving for outlet to the thoughts that clamoured tumultuous at his brain never more insistent more imperious
thus he wrote dabney dead hooven dead harran dead annixter dead broderson dead osterman dying behrman alive successful the railroad in possession of quien sabe
i saw them shot
not twelve hours since i stood there at the irrigating ditch
ah that terrible moment of horror and confusion powder pistol staggering to their in a horrible posture one rigid leg high in the air across his falling sideways into the laying himself down his head on his arms as if tired tired out
these things i have seen them
the picture of this days work is from henceforth part of my mind part of they have done it behrman and the owners of the railroad have done it while all the world looked on while the people of these united states looked on
oh come now and try your theories upon us us of the ranchos us who have suffered us who oh talk to now of the rights of capital talk to of the trust talk to of the equilibrium between the classes
try your ingenious ideas upon us
i cannot tell whether or not your theories are excellent
i do not know if your ideas are plausible
i do not know how practical is your scheme of society
i do not know if the railroad has a right to our lands but i know that harran is dead that annixter is dead that broderson is dead that hooven is dead that osterman is dying and that behrman is alive successful triumphant that he has ridden into possession of a principality over the dead bodies of five men shot down by his hired associates can see the outcome
the railroad will prevail
the trust will overpower us
here in this corner of a great nation here on the edge of the continent here in this valley of the west far from the great centres isolated remote lost the great iron hand crushes life from us crushes liberty and the pursuit of happiness from us and our little struggles our moments convulsion of death agony causes not one jar in the vast clashing machinery of the nations life a fleck of grit in the wheels perhaps a grain of sand in the momentary creak of the axle is the mothers wail of bereavement the wifes cry of the great wheel turns spinning smooth again even again and the tiny impediment of a second scarce noticed is forgotten
make the people believe that the faint tremour in their great engine is a menace to its function
what a folly to think of it
tell them of the danger and they will laugh at you
tell them five years from now the story of the fight between the league of the san joaquin and the railroad and it will not be believed
what a pitched battle between farmer and railroad a battle that cost the lives of seven men
impossible it could not have happened
your story is exaggerated
yet it is help us god enlighten us god rouse us from our is lexington farmers with guns in their hands fighting for liberty
is our state of california the only one that has its ancient and hereditary foe
are there no other trusts between the oceans than this of the pacific and southwestern railroad
ask yourselves you of the middle west ask yourselves you of the north ask yourselves you of the east ask yourselves you of the yourselves every citizen of every state from maine to mexico from the dakotas to the carolinas have you not the monster in your boundaries
if it is not a trust of transportation it is only another head of the same hydra
is not our death struggle typical
is it not one of many is it not symbolical of the great and terrible conflict that is going on everywhere in these united states
ah you people blind bound tricked betrayed can you not see it
can you not see how the monsters have plundered your treasures and holding them in the grip of their iron claws dole them out to you only at the price of your blood at the price of the lives of your wives and your little children
you give your babies to moloch for the loaf of bread you have kneaded yourselves
you offer your starved wives to juggernaut for the iron nail you have yourselves compounded
he spent the night over his journal writing down such thoughts as these or walking the floor from wall to wall or seized at times with unreasoning horror and blind rage flinging himself face downward upon his bed vowing with inarticulate cries that neither behrman nor shelgrim should ever live to consummate their triumph
morning came and with it the daily papers and news
presley did not even glance at the mercury
bonneville published two other daily journals that professed to voice the will and reflect the temper of the people and these he read eagerly
osterman was yet alive and there were chances of his recovery
the three hundred of its members had gathered at bonneville over night and were patrolling the streets and still resolved to keep the peace were even guarding the railroad shops and buildings
furthermore the leaguers had issued manifestoes urging all citizens to preserve law and order yet summoning an indignation meeting to be convened that afternoon at the city opera house
it appeared from the newspapers that those who obstructed the marshal in the discharge of his duty could be proceeded against by the district attorney on information or by bringing the matter before the grand jury
but the grand jury was not at that time in session and it was known that there were no funds in the marshals office to pay expenses for the summoning of jurors or the serving of processes
behrman and ruggles in interviews stated that the railroad withdrew entirely from the fight the matter now according to them was between the leaguers and the united states government they washed their hands of the whole business
the ranchers could settle with washington
but it seemed that congress had recently forbade the use of troops for civil purposes the whole matter of the leaguerailroad contest was evidently for the moment to be left in status quo
but to mind the most important piece of news that morning was the report of the action of the railroad upon hearing of the battle
instantly bonneville had been isolated
not a single local train was running not one of the through trains made any halt at the station
the mails were not moved
further than this by some arrangement difficult to understand the telegraph operators at bonneville and guadalajara acting under orders refused to receive any telegrams except those emanating from railway officials
the story of the fight the story creating the first impression was to be told to san francisco and the outside world by behrman ruggles and the local and agents
an hour before breakfast the undertakers arrived and took charge of the bodies of harran and annixter
presley saw neither hilma magnus nor mrs derrick
the doctor came to look after hilma
he breakfasted with mrs dyke and presley and from him presley learned that hilma would recover both from the shock of her husbands death and from her miscarriage of the previous night
she ought to have her mother with her said the physician
she does nothing but call for her or beg to be allowed to go to her
i have tried to get a wire through to mrs tree but the company will not take it and even if i could get word to her how could she get down here
there are no trains
but presley found that it was impossible for him to stay at los muertos that day
gloom and the shadow of tragedy brooded heavy over the place
a great silence pervaded everything a silence broken only by the subdued coming and going of the undertaker and his assistants
when presley having resolved to go into bonneville came out through the doorway of the house he found the undertaker tying a long strip of crape to the bellhandle
presley saddled his pony and rode into town
by this time after long hours of continued reflection upon one subject a sombre brooding malevolence a deepseated desire of revenge had grown big within his mind
the first numbness had passed off familiarity with what had been done had blunted the edge of horror and now the impulse of retaliation prevailed
at first the sullen anger of defeat the sense of outrage had only smouldered but the more he brooded the fiercer flamed his rage
sudden paroxysms of wrath gripped him by the throat abrupt outbursts of fury injected his eyes with blood
he ground his teeth his mouth filled with curses his hands clenched till they grew white and bloodless
was the railroad to triumph then in the end
after all those months of preparation after all those grandiloquent resolutions after all the arrogant presumption of the league
the league what a farce what had it amounted to when the crisis came
was the trust to crush them all so easily
was behrman to swallow los muertos
behrman
presley saw him plainly huge rotund white saw his jowl tremulous and obese the roll of fat over his collar sprinkled with sparse hairs the great stomach with its brown linen vest and heavy watch chain of hollow links clinking against the buttons of imitation pearl
and this man was to crush magnus already stamped the life from such men as harran and annixter
this man in the name of the trust was to grab los muertos as he had grabbed quien sabe and after los muertos ranch then then others and still others the whole valley the whole state
presley beat his forehead with his clenched fist as he rode on
no he cried no kill him kill him kill him with my hands
the idea of it put him beside himself
oh to sink his fingers deep into the white fat throat of the man to clutch like iron into the great puffed jowl of him to wrench out the life to batter it out strangle it out to pay him back for the long years of extortion and oppression to square accounts for bribed jurors bought judges corrupted legislatures to have justice for the trick of the ranchers railroad commission the charlatanism of the ten per cent cut the ruin of dyke the seizure of quien sabe the murder of harran the assassination of annixter
it was in such mood that he reached the saloonkeeper had just opened his place and was standing in his doorway smoking his pipe
presley dismounted and went in and the two had a long talk
when three hours later presley came out of the saloon and rode on towards bonneville his face was very pale his lips shut tight resolute determined
his manner was that of a man whose mind is made up
the hour for the mass meeting at the opera house had been set for one oclock but long before noon the street in front of the building and in fact all the streets in its vicinity were packed from side to side with a shifting struggling surging and excited multitude
there were few women in the throng but hardly a single male inhabitant of either bonneville or guadalajara was absent
men had even come from visalia and pixley
it was no longer the crowd of curiosity seekers that had thronged around place by the irrigating ditch the people were no longer confused bewildered
a full realisation of just what had been done the day before was clear now in the minds of all
business was suspended nearly all the stores were closed
since early morning the members of the league had put in an appearance and rode from point to point their rifles across their saddle pommels
then by ten oclock the streets had begun to fill up the groups on the corners grew and merged into one another pedestrians unable to find room on the sidewalks took to the streets
hourly the crowd increased till shoulders touched and elbows till free circulation became impeded then congested then impossible
the crowd a solid mass was wedged tight from store front to store front
and from all this throng this single unit this living breathing rose a droning terrible note
it was not yet the wild fierce clamour of riot and insurrection shrill high pitched but it was a beginning the growl of the awakened brute feeling the iron in its flank heaving up its head with bared teeth the throat vibrating to the long indrawn snarl of wrath
thus the forenoon passed while the people their bulk growing hourly vaster kept to the streets moving slowly backward and forward oscillating in the grooves of the thoroughfares the steady lowpitched growl rising continually into the hot still air
then at length about twelve oclock the movement of the throng assumed definite direction
it set towards the opera house
presley who had left his pony at the city livery stable found himself caught in the current and carried slowly forward in its direction
his arms were pinioned to his sides by the press the crush against his body was all but ribcracking he could hardly draw his breath
all around him rose and fell wave after wave of faces hundreds upon hundreds thousands upon thousands red lowering sullen
all were set in one direction and slowly slowly they advanced crowding closer till they almost touched one another
for reasons that were inexplicable great tumultuous heavings like groundswells of an incoming tide surged over and through the multitude
at times presley lifted from his feet was swept back back back with the crowd till the entrance of the opera house was half a block away then the returning billow beat back again and swung him along gasping staggering clutching till he was landed once more in the vortex of frantic action in front of the foyer
here the waves were shorter quicker the crushing pressure on all sides of his body left him without strength to utter the cry that rose to his lips then suddenly the whole mass of struggling stamping fighting writhing men about him seemed as it were to rise to lift multitudinous swelling gigantic
a mighty rush dashed presley forward in its leap
there was a moments whirl of confused sights congested faces opened mouths bloodshot eyes clutching hands a moments outburst of furious sound shouts cheers oaths a moments jam wherein presley veritably believed his ribs must snap like pipestems and he was carried dazed breathless helpless an atom on the crest of a stormdriven wave up the steps of the opera house on into the vestibule through the doors and at last into the auditorium of the house itself
there was a mad rush for places men disdaining the aisle stepped from one orchestra chair to another striding over the backs of seats leaving the print of dusty feet upon the red plush cushions
in a twinkling the house was filled from stage to topmost gallery
the aisles were packed solid even on the edge of the stage itself men were sitting a black fringe on either side of the footlights
the curtain was up disclosing a halfset flats leaning at perilous represented some sort of terrace the pavement alternate squares of black and white marble while red white and yellow flowers were represented as growing from urns and vases
a long double row of chairs stretched across the scene from wing to wing flanking a table covered with a red cloth on which was set a pitcher of water and a speakers gavel
promptly these chairs were filled up with members of the league the audience cheering as certain wellknown figures made their of the ruby ranch gethings of the san pablo keast of the ranch of the same name chattern of the bonanza elderly men bearded slow of speech deliberate
garnett opened the meeting his speech was plain straightforward matteroffact
he simply told what had happened
he announced that certain resolutions were to be drawn up
he introduced the next speaker
this one pleaded for moderation
he was conservative
all along he had opposed the idea of armed resistance except as the very last resort
he deplored the terrible affair of yesterday
he begged the people to wait in patience to attempt no more violence
he informed them that armed guards of the league were at that moment patrolling los muertos and it was well known that the united states marshal confessed himself powerless to serve the writs
there would be no more bloodshed
we have had he continued bloodshed enough and i want to say right here that i am not so sure but what yesterdays terrible affair might have been avoided
a gentleman whom we all esteem who from the first has been our recognised leader is at this moment mourning the loss of a young son killed before his eyes
god knows that i sympathise as do we all in the affliction of our president
i am sorry for him
my heart goes out to him in this hour of distress but at the same time the position of the league must be defined
we owe it to ourselves we owe it to the people of this county
the league armed for the very purpose of preserving the peace not of breaking it
we believed that with six hundred armed and drilled men at our disposal ready to muster at a moments call we could so overawe any attempt to expel us from our lands that such an attempt would not be made until the cases pending before the supreme court had been decided
if when the enemy appeared in our midst yesterday they had been met by six hundred rifles it is not conceivable that the issue would have been forced
no fight would have ensued and today we would not have to mourn the deaths of four of our fellowcitizens
a mistake has been made and we of the league must not be held responsible
the speaker sat down amidst loud applause from the leaguers and less pronounced demonstrations on the part of the audience
a second leaguer took his place a tall clumsy man halfrancher halfpolitician want to second what my colleague has just said he began
this matter of resisting the marshal when he tried to put the railroad dummies in possession on the ranches around here was all talked over in the committee meetings of the league long ago
it never was our intention to fire a single shot
no such absolute authority as was assumed yesterday was delegated to anybody
our esteemed president is all right but we all know that he is a man who loves authority and who likes to go his own gait without accounting to anybody rest of us were informed as to what was going on
we supposed of course that watch was being kept on the railroad so as we wouldnot be taken by surprise as we were yesterday
and it seems no watch was kept at all or if there was it was mighty ineffective
our idea was to forestall any movement on the part of the railroad and then when we knew the marshal was coming down to call a meeting of our executive committee and decide as to what should be done
we ought to have had time to call out the whole league
instead of that what happens
while were all off chasing rabbits the railroad is allowed to steal a march on us and when it is too late a handful of leaguers is got together and a fight is precipitated and our men killed sorry for our president too
no one is more so but i want to put myself on record as believing he did a hasty and inconsiderate thing
if he had managed right he could have had six hundred men to oppose the railroad and there would not have been any gun fight or any killing
he manage right and there a killing and i donot see as how the league ought to be held responsible
the idea of the league the whole reason why it was organised was to protect the ranches of this valley from the railroad and it looks to me as if the lives of our fellowcitizens had been sacrificed not in defending of our ranches but just in defence of one of one that mr derrick owns
the speaker had no more than regained his seat when a man was seen pushing his way from the back of the stage towards garnett
he handed the rancher a note at the same time whispering in his ear
garnett read the note then came forward to the edge of the stage holding up his hand
when the audience had fallen silent he said have just received sad news
our friend and fellowcitizen mr osterman died this morning between eleven and twelve oclock
instantly there was a roar
every man in the building rose to his feet shouting gesticulating
the roar increased the opera house trembled to it the gas jets in the lighted chandeliers vibrated to it
it was a raucous howl of execration a bellow of rage inarticulate deafening
a tornado of confusion swept whirling from wall to wall and the madness of the moment seized irresistibly upon presley
he forgot himself he no longer was master of his emotions or his impulses
all at once he found himself upon the stage facing the audience flaming with excitement his imagination on fire his arms uplifted in fierce wild gestures words leaping to his mind in a torrent that could not be withheld
one more dead he cried one more
harran dead annixter dead broderson dead dabney dead osterman dead hooven dead shot down killed killed in the defence of their homes killed in the defence of their rights killed for the sake of liberty
how long must it go on
how long must we suffer
where is the end what is the end
how long must the ironhearted monster feed on our lifes blood
how long must this terror of steam and steel ride upon our necks
will you never be satisfied will you never relent you our masters you our lords you our kings you our taskmasters you our pharoahs
will you never listen to that command oh that cry ringing down the ages
hear it hear it
it is the voice of the lord god speaking in his prophets
hear it hear my people go
rameses heard it in his pylons at thebes caesar heard it on the palatine the bourbon louis heard it at versailles charles stuart heard it at whitehall the white czar heard it in the it is the cry of the nations the great voice of the centuries everywhere it is raised
the voice of god is the voice of the people
the people cry out let us the people people go
you our masters you our kings you our tyrants donot you hear us you hear god speaking in us
will you never let us go
how long at length will you abuse our patience
how long will you drive us
how long will you harass us
will nothing daunt you
does nothing check you
do you not know that to ignore our cry too long is to wake the red terror
rameses refused to listen to it and perished miserably
caesar refused to listen and was stabbed in the senate house
the bourbon louis refused to listen and died on the guillotine charles stuart refused to listen and died on the block the white czar refused to listen and was blown up in his own capital
will you let it come to that
will you drive us to it
we who boast of our land of freedom we who live in the country of liberty
go on as you have begun and it come to that
turn a deaf ear to that cry of let my people go too long and another cry will be raised that you cannot choose but hear a cry that you cannot shut out
it will be the cry of the man on the street the a la bastille that wakes the red terror and unleashes revolution
harassed plundered exasperated desperate the people will turn at last as they have turned so many many times before
you our lords you our taskmasters you our kings you have caught your samson you have made his strength your own
you have shorn his head you have put out his eyes you have set him to turn your millstones to grind the grist for your mills you have made him a shame and a mock
take care oh as you love your lives take care lest some day calling upon the lord his god he reach not out his arms for the pillars of your temples
the audience at first bewildered confused by this unexpected invective suddenly took fire at his last words
there was a roar of applause then more significant than mere vociferation listeners as he began to speak again grew suddenly silent
his next sentences were uttered in the midst of a profound stillness
they own us these taskmasters of ours they own our homes they own our legislatures
we cannot escape from them
there is no redress
we are told we can defeat them by the ballotbox
they own the ballotbox
we are told that we must look to the courts for redress they own the courts
we know them for what they in politics ruffians in finance ruffians in law ruffians in trade bribers swindlers and tricksters
no outrage too great to daunt them no petty larceny too small to shame them despoiling a government treasury of a million dollars yet picking the pockets of a farm hand of the price of a loaf of bread
they swindle a nation of a hundred million and call it financiering they levy a blackmail and call it commerce they corrupt a legislature and call it politics they bribe a judge and call it law they hire blacklegs to carry out their plans and call it organisation they prostitute the honour of a state and call it competition
and this is america
we fought lexington to free ourselves we fought gettysburg to free others
yet the yoke remains we have only shifted it to the other shoulder
we talk of libertyoh the farce of it oh the folly of it
we tell ourselves and teach our children that we have achieved liberty that we no longer need fight for it
why the fight is just beginning and so long as our conception of liberty remains as it is today it will continue
for we conceive of liberty in the statues we raise to her as a beautiful woman crowned victorious in bright armour and white robes a light in her uplifted serene calm conquering goddess
oh the farce of it oh the folly of it
liberty is a crowned goddess beautiful in spotless garments victorious supreme
liberty is the man in the street a terrible figure rushing through powder smoke fouled with the mud and ordure of the gutter bloody rampant brutal yelling curses in one hand a smoking rifle in the other a blazing torch
freedom is given free to any who ask liberty is not born of the gods
she is a child of the people born in the very height and heat of battle born from death stained with blood grimed with powder
and she grows to be not a goddess but a fury a fearful figure slaying friend and foe alike raging insatiable merciless the red terror
presley ceased speaking
weak shaking scarcely knowing what he was about he descended from the stage
a prolonged explosion of applause followed the opera house roaring to the roof men cheering stamping waving their hats
but it was not intelligent applause
instinctively as he made his way out presley knew that after all he had not once held the hearts of his audience
he had talked as he would have written for all his scorn of literature he had been literary
the men who listened to him ranchers country people storekeepers attentive though they were were not once sympathetic
vaguely they had felt that here was something which other possibly consider eloquent
they applauded vociferously but perfunctorily in order to appear to understand
presley for all his love of the people saw clearly for one moment that he was an outsider to their minds
he had not helped them nor their cause in the least he never would
disappointed bewildered ashamed he made his way slowly from the opera house and stood on the steps outside thoughtful his head bent
he had failed thus he told himself
in that moment of crisis that at the time he believed had been an inspiration he had failed
the people would not consider him would not believe that he could do them service
then suddenly he seemed to remember
the resolute set of his lips returned once more
pushing his way through the crowded streets he went on towards the stable where he had left his pony
meanwhile in the opera house a great commotion had occurred
magnus derrick had appeared
only a sense of enormous responsibility of gravest duty could have prevailed upon magnus to have left his house and the dead body of his son that day
but he was the president of the league and never since its organisation had a meeting of such importance as this one been held
he had been in command at the irrigating ditch the day before
it was he who had gathered the handful of leaguers together
it was he who must bear the responsibility of the fight
when he had entered the opera house making his way down the central aisle towards the stage a loud disturbance had broken out partly applause partly a meaningless uproar
many had pressed forward to shake his hand but others were not found wanting who formerly his staunch supporters now scenting opposition in the air held back hesitating afraid to compromise themselves by adhering to the fortunes of a man whose actions might be discredited by the very organisation of which he was the head
declining to take the chair of presiding officer which garnett offered him the governor withdrew to an angle of the stage where he was joined by keast
this one still unalterably devoted to magnus acquainted him briefly with the tenor of the speeches that had been made am ashamed of them governor he protested indignantly to lose their nerve now
to fail you now it makes my blood boil
if you had succeeded yesterday if all had gone well do you think we would have heard of any talk of assumption of authority or acting without advice and consent
as if there was any time to call a meeting of the executive committee
if you hadnot acted as you did the whole county would have been grabbed by the railroad
get up governor and bring em all up standing
just tear em all to pieces show em that you are the head the boss what they need
that killing yesterday has shaken the nerve clean out of them
for the instant the governor was taken all aback
what his lieutenants were failing him
what he was to be questioned interpolated upon yesterdays irrepressible conflict
had disaffection appeared in the ranks of the this of all moments
he put from him his terrible grief
the cause was in danger
at the instant he was the president of the league only the chief the master
a royal anger surged within him a wide towering scorn of opposition
he would crush this disaffection in its incipiency would vindicate himself and strengthen the cause at one and the same time
he stepped forward and stood in the speakers place turning partly toward the audience partly toward the assembled leaguers
gentlemen of the league he began citizens of bonneville but at once the silence in which the governor had begun to speak was broken by a shout
it was as though his words had furnished a signal
in a certain quarter of the gallery directly opposite a man arose and in a voice partly of derision partly of defiance cried out how about the bribery of those two delegates at sacramento
tell us about that what we want to hear about
a great confusion broke out
the first cry was repeated not only by the original speaker but by a whole group of which he was but a part
others in the audience however seeing in the disturbance only the clamour of a few railroad supporters attempted to howl them down hissing vigorously and exclaiming put em out put em out
order order called garnett pounding with his gavel
the whole opera house was in an uproar
but the interruption of the speech was evidently not unpremeditated
it began to look like a deliberate and planned attack
persistently doggedly the group in the gallery vociferated tell us how you bribed the delegates at sacramento
before you throw mud at the railroad lets see if you are clean yourself
put em out put em out
briber derrick unconvicted briber
put him out
keast beside himself with anger pushed down the aisle underneath where the recalcitrant group had its place and shaking his fist called up at them you were paid to break up this meeting
if you have anything to say you will be afforded the opportunity but if you do not let the gentleman proceed the police will be called upon to put you out
but at this the man who had raised the first shout leaned over the balcony rail and his face flaming with wrath shouted talk to me of your police
look out we donot call on them first to arrest your president for bribery
you and your howl about law and justice and corruption turned to the about him read the story of how the sacramento convention was bought by magnus derrick president of the san joaquin league the facts printed and proved
with the words he stooped down and from under his seat dragged forth a great package of extra editions of the bonneville mercury not an hour off the presses
other equally large bundles of the paper appeared in the hands of the surrounding group
the strings were cut and in handfuls and armfuls the papers were flung out over the heads of the audience underneath
the air was full of the flutter of the newly printed sheets
they swarmed over the rim of the gallery like clouds of monstrous winged insects settled upon the heads and into the hands of the audience were passed swiftly from man to man and within five minutes of the first outbreak every one in the opera house had read detailed and substantiated account of magnus deal with the political bosses of the sacramento convention
genslinger after pocketing the hush money had sold him out
keast one quiver of indignation made his way back upon the stage
the leaguers were in wild confusion
half the assembly of them were on their feet bewildered shouting vaguely
from proscenium wall to foyer the opera house was a tumult of noise
the gleam of the thousands of the mercury extras was like the flash of white caps on a troubled sea
keast faced the audience
liars he shouted striving with all the power of his voice to dominate the clamour liars and slanderers
your paper is the paid organ of the corporation
you have not one shadow of proof to back you up
do you choose this of all times to heap your calumny upon the head of an honourable gentleman already prostrated by your murder of his son demand your proofs got the very assemblymen themselves came back the answering shout
let derrick speak
where is he hiding
if this is a lie let him deny it
let the charge
derrick derrick thundered the opera house
keast wheeled about
where was magnus
he was not in sight upon the stage
he had disappeared
crowding through the throng of leaguers keast got from off the stage into the wings
here the crowd was no less dense
nearly every one had a copy of the mercury
it was being read aloud to groups here and there and once keast overheard the words say i wonder if this is true after all
well and even if it was cried keast turning upon the speaker we should be the last ones to kick
in any case it was done for our benefit
it elected the ranchers commission lot of benefit we got out of the ranchers commission retorted the other
and then protested a third speaker that ainot the way to he do legislatures
why we were bucking against corrupt politics
we couldnot afford to be corrupt
keast turned away with a gesture of impatience
he pushed his way farther on
at last opening a small door in a hallway back of the stage he came upon magnus
the room was tiny
it was a dressingroom
only two nights before it had been used by the leading actress of a comic opera troupe which had played for three nights at bonneville
a tattered sofa and limping toilet table occupied a third of the space
the air was heavy with the smell of stale grease paint ointments and sachet
faded photographs of young women in tights and gauzes ornamented the mirror and the walls
underneath the sofa was an old pair of corsets
the spangled skirt of a pink dress turned inside out hung against the wall
and in the midst of such environment surrounded by an excited group of men who gesticulated and shouted in his very face pale alert agitated his thin lips pressed tightly together stood magnus derrick
here cried keast as he entered closing the door behind him the governor
here magnus been looking for you
the crowd has gone wild out there got to talk em down
come out there and give those blacklegs the lie
they are saying you are hiding
but before magnus could reply garnett turned to keast
well thats what we want him to do and he wonot do it
yes yes cried the halfdozen men who crowded around magnus yes thats what we want him to do
keast turned to magnus
why whats all this governor he exclaimed got to answer that
hey why donot you give em the lie
magnus loosened the collar about his throat it is a lie
i will not would would be beneath would be beneath me
keast stared in amazement
was this the great man the leader indomitable of roman integrity of roman valour before whose voice whole conventions had quailed
was it possible he was to face those hired villifiers
well how about this demanded garnett suddenly
it is a lie isnot it
that commission was elected honestly wasnot it
how dare you sir
magnus burst out
how dare you question me to account
please understand sir that i tolerate oh quit it cried a voice from the group
you canot scare us derrick
that sort of talk was well enough once but it donot go any more
we want a yes or no answer
it was oldtime power of mastery that faculty of command
the ground crumbled beneath his feet
long since it had been by his own hand undermined
authority was gone
why keep up this miserable sham any longer
could they not read the lie in his face in his voice
what a folly to maintain the wretched pretence
he had failed
he was ruined
harran was gone
his ranch would soon go his money was gone
lyman was worse than dead
his own honour had been prostituted
gone gone everything he held dear gone lost and swept away in that fierce struggle
and suddenly and all in a moment the last remaining shells of the fabric of his being the sham that had stood already wonderfully long cracked and collapsed
was the commission honestly elected insisted garnett
were the you bribe the delegates
we were obliged to shut our eyes to means faltered magnus
there was no other way to then suddenly and with the last dregs of his resolution he concluded with yes i gave them two thousand dollars each
oh hell
oh my god exclaimed keast sitting swiftly down upon the ragged sofa
there was a long silence
a sense of poignant embarrassment descended upon those present
no one knew what to say or where to look
garnett with a laboured attempt at nonchalance murmured see
well thats what i was trying to get at
yes i see
well said gethings at length bestirring himself guess go home
there was a movement
the group broke up the men making for the door
one by one they went out
the last to go was keast
he came up to magnus and shook the limp hand
governor he said see you again pretty soon let this discourage you come around all right after a while
so long
he went out shutting the door
and seated in the one chair of the room magnus derrick remained a long time looking at his face in the cracked mirror that for so many years had reflected the painted faces of soubrettes in this atmosphere of stale perfume and mouldy rice powder
it had fall his ruin
after so many years of integrity and honest battle his life had ended an actresss dressingroom deserted by his friends his son murdered his dishonesty known an old man broken discarded discredited and abandoned
before nightfall of that day bonneville was further excited by an astonishing bit of news
behrman lived in a detached house at some distance from the town surrounded by a grove of live oak and eucalyptus trees
at a little after halfpast six as he was sitting down to his supper a bomb was thrown through the window of his diningroom exploding near the doorway leading into the hall
the room was wrecked and nearly every window of the house shattered
by a miracle behrman himself remained untouched
on a certain afternoon in the early part of july about a month after the fight at the irrigating ditch and the mass meeting at bonneville cedarquist at the moment opening his mail in his office in san francisco was genuinely surprised to receive a visit from presley
well upon my word pres exclaimed the manufacturer as the young man came in through the door that the office boy held open for him upon my word have you been sick
sit down my boy
have a glass of sherry
i always keep a bottle here
presley accepted the wine and sank into the depths of a great leather chair near by
sick he answered
yes i have been sick sick now gone to pieces sir
his manner was the extreme of listlessness of great fatigue
well well observed the other right sorry to hear that the trouble pres
oh nerves mostly i suppose and my head and insomnia and weakness a general collapse all along the line the doctor tells me he says overexcitement
i fancy i rather narrowly missed brain fever
well i can easily suppose it answered cedarquist gravely after all you have been through
presley closed his were sunken in circles of dark brown pressed a thin hand to the back of his head
it is a nightmare he murmured frightful nightmare and its not over yet
you have heard of it all only through the newspaper reports
but down there at bonneville at los you can have no idea of it of the misery caused by the defeat of the ranchers and by this decision of the supreme court that dispossesses them all
we had gone on hoping to the last that we would win there
we had thought that in the supreme court of the united states at least we could find justice
and the news of its decision was the worst last blow of all
for magnus it was the the very last
poor poor derrick murmured cedarquist
tell me about him pres
how does he take it
what is he going to do
it beggars him sir
he sunk a great deal more than any of us believed in his ranch when he resolved to turn off most of the tenants and farm the ranch himself
then the fight he made against the railroad in the courts and the political campaign he went into to get lyman on the railroad commission took more of it
the money that genslinger blackmailed him of it seems was about all he had left
he had been know the another bonanza crop this year to recoup him
well the bonanza came right in time for behrman and the railroad to grab it
magnus is ruined
what a tragedy what a tragedy murmured the other
lyman turning rascal harran killed and now this and all within so short a at the time you might almost say
if it had only killed him continued presley but that is the worst of it
how the worst afraid honestly afraid it is going to turn his wits sir broken him oh you should see him you should see him
a shambling stooping trembling old man in his dotage already
he sits all day in the diningroom turning over papers sorting them tying them up opening them again forgetting fumbling and mumbling and confused
and at table sometimes he forgets to eat
and listen you know from the house we can hear the trains whistling for the long trestle
as often as that happens the governor seems to beoh i donot know frightened
he will sink his head between his shoulders as though he were dodging something and he wonot fetch a long breath again till the train is out of hearing
he seems to have conceived an abject unreasoned terror of the railroad
but he will have to leave los muertos now of course
yes they will all have to leave
they have a fortnight more
the few tenants that were still on los muertos are leaving
that is one thing that brings me to the city
the family of one of the men who was was his come to the city to find work
i think they are liable to be in great distress unless they have been wonderfully lucky and i am trying to find them in order to look after them
you need looking after yourself pres
oh once away from bonneville and the sight of the ruin there better
but i intend to go away
and that makes me think i came to ask you if you could help me
if you would let me take passage on one of your wheat ships
the doctor says an ocean voyage would set me up
why certainly pres declared cedarquist
but sorry youll have to go
we expected to have you down in the country with us this winter
presley shook his head
no he answered must go
even if i had all my health i could not bring myself to stay in california just now
if you can introduce me to one of your captains with pleasure
when do you want to go
you may have to wait a few weeks
our first ship wonot clear till the end of the month
that would do very well
thank you sir
but cedarquist was still interested in the land troubles of the bonneville farmers and took the first occasion to ask so the railroad are in possession on most of the ranches
on all of them returned presley
the league went all to pieces so soon as magnus was forced to resign
the old got quarrelling among themselves
somebody started a compromise party and upon that issue a new president was elected
then there were defections
the railroad offered to lease the lands in question to the ranchers who owned them he exclaimed bitterly and because the terms were of the men took the chance of saving themselves
and of course once signing the lease they acknowledged the title
but the road would not lease to magnus
behrman takes over los muertos in a few weeks now
no doubt the road made over their title in the property to him observed cedarquist as a reward of his services
no doubt murmured presley wearily
he rose to go
by the way said cedarquist what have you on hand for let us say friday evening you dine with us then
the girls are going to the country monday of next week and you probably wonot see them again for some time if you take that ocean voyage of yours afraid i shall be very poor company sir hazarded presley no go no life in me at all these days
i am like a clock with a broken spring
not broken pres my boy urged the other only run down
try and see if we canot wind you up a bit
say that we can expect you
we dine at seven
thank you sir
till friday at seven then
regaining the street presley sent his valise to his club where he had engaged a room by a messenger boy and boarded a castro street car
before leaving bonneville he had ascertained by strenuous enquiry mrs address in the city and thitherward he now directed his steps
when presley had told cedarquist that he was ill that he was jaded worn out he had only told half the truth
exhausted he was nerveless weak but this apathy was still invaded from time to time with fierce incursions of a spirit of unrest and revolt reactions momentary returns of the blind undirected energy that at one time had prompted him to a vast desire to acquit himself of some terrible deed of readjustment just what he could not say some terrifying martyrdom some aweinspiring immolation consummate incisive conclusive
he fancied himself to be fired with the purblind mistaken heroism of the anarchist hurling his victim to destruction with full knowledge that the catastrophe shall sweep him also into the vortex it creates
but his constitutional irresoluteness obstructed his path continually brainsick weak of will emotional timid even he temporised procrastinated brooded came to decisions in the dark hours of the night only to abandon them in the morning
once only he had and at this moment as he was carried through the windy squalid streets he trembled at the remembrance of it
the horror of what might have been incompatible with the vengeance whose minister he fancied he was oppressed him
the scene perpetually reconstructed itself in his imagination
he saw himself under the shade of the encompassing trees and shrubbery creeping on his belly toward the house in the suburbs of bonneville watching his chances seizing opportunities spying upon the lighted windows where the raised curtains afforded a view of the interior
then had come the appearance in the glare of the gas of the figure of the man for whom he waited
he saw himself rise and run forward
he remembered the feel and weight in his hand of six inches of plugged gas pipe
his upraised arm shot forward
there was a shiver of smashed windowpanes red whirl of confusion the air rent the ground rocking himself flung headlong flung off the spinning circumference of things out into a place of terror and vacancy and darkness
and then after a long time the return of reason the consciousness that his feet were set upon the road to los muertos and that he was fleeing terrorstricken gasping all but insane with hysteria
then the night that ensued when he descended into the pit horrified at what he supposed he had done at one moment ridden with remorse at another raging against his own feebleness his lack of courage his wretched vacillating spirit
but morning had come and with it the knowledge that he had failed and the baser assurance that he was not even remotely suspected
his own escape had been no less miraculous than that of his enemy and he had fallen on his knees in inarticulate prayer weeping pouring out his thanks to god for the deliverance from the gulf to the very brink of which his feet had been drawn
after this however there had come to presley a deeprooted suspicion that he all human beings the most failure
everything to which he had set his mind great epic his efforts to help the people who surrounded him even his attempted destruction of the enemy all these had come to nothing
girding his shattered strength together he resolved upon one last attempt to live up to the best that was in him and to that end had set himself to lift out of the despair into which they had been thrust the bereaved family of the german hooven
after all was over and hooven together with the seven others who had fallen at the irrigating ditch was buried in the bonneville cemetery mrs hooven asking no ones aid or advice and taking with her minna and little hilda had gone to san gone to find work abandoning los muertos and her home forever
presley only learned of the departure of the family after fifteen days had elapsed
at once however the suspicion forced itself upon him that mrs minna too for the matter of thatcountrybred ignorant of city ways might easily come to grief in the hard huge struggle of city life
this suspicion had swiftly hardened to a conviction acting at last upon which presley had followed them to san francisco bent upon finding and assisting them
the house to which presley was led by the address in his memorandum book was a cheap but fairly decent hotel near the power house of the castro street cable
he inquired for mrs hooven
the landlady recollected the hoovens perfectly
german woman with a little girlbaby and an older daughter sure
the older daughter was main pretty
sure i remember them but they ainot here no more
they left a week ago i had to ask them for their room
as it was they owed a weeks roomrent
mister i canot afford well do you know where they went
did you hear what address they had their trunk expressed to
ah yes their trunk vociferated the woman clapping her hands to her hips her face purpling
their trunk ah sure
i got their trunk and what are you going to do about it holding it till i get my money
what have you got to say about it hear it
presley turned away with a gesture of discouragement his heart sinking
on the street corner he stood for a long time frowning in trouble and perplexity
his suspicions had been only too well founded
so long ago as a week the hoovens had exhausted all their little store of money
for seven days now they had been without resources unless indeed work had been found and what he asked himself what work in name could they find to do here in the city
seven days
he quailed at the thought of it
seven days without money knowing not a soul in all that swarming city
ignorant of city life as both minna and her mother were would they even realise that there were institutions built and generously endowed for just such as they
he knew them to have their share of pride the dogged sullen pride of the peasant even if they knew of charitable organisations would they could they bring themselves to apply there
a poignant anxiety thrust itself sharply into heart
where were they now
where had they slept last night
where breakfasted this morning
had there even been any breakfast this morning
had there even been any bed last night
lost and forgotten in the plexus of the citys life what had befallen them
towards what fate was the ebb tide of the streets drifting them
was this to be still another theme wrought out by iron hands upon the old the worldold worldwide keynote
how far were the consequences of that dreadful days work at the irrigating ditch to reach
to what length was the tentacle of the monster to extend
presley returned toward the central the business quarter of the city alternately formulating and dismissing from his mind plan after plan for the finding and aiding of mrs hooven and her daughters
he reached montgomery street and turned toward his club his imagination once more reviewing all the causes and circumstances of the great battle of which for the last eighteen months he had been witness
all at once he paused his eye caught by a sign affixed to the wall just inside the street entrance of a huge office building and smitten with an idea stood for an instant motionless upon the sidewalk his eyes wide his fists shut tight
the building contained the general office of the pacific and southwestern railroad
large though it was it nevertheless was not pretentious and during his visits to the city presley must have passed it unheeding many times
but for all that it was the stronghold of the centre of all that vast ramifying system of arteries that drained the lifeblood of the state the nucleus of the web in which so many lives so many fortunes so many destinies had been enmeshed
from this he told emanated that policy of extortion oppression and injustice that little by little had shouldered the ranchers from their rights till their backs to the wall exasperated and despairing they had turned and fought and died
from here had come the orders to behrman to cyrus ruggles and to genslinger the orders that had brought dyke to a prison that had killed annixter that had ruined magnus that had corrupted lyman
here was the keep of the castle and here behind one of those many windows in one of those many offices his hand upon the levers of his mighty engine sat the master shelgrim himself
instantly upon the realisation of this fact an ungovernable desire seized upon presley an inordinate curiosity
why not see face to face the man whose power was so vast whose will was so resistless whose potency for evil so limitless the man who for so long and so hopelessly they had all been fighting
by reputation he knew him to be approachable why should he not then approach him
presley took his resolution in both hands
if he failed to act upon this impulse he knew he would never act at all
his heart beating his breath coming short he entered the building and in a few moments found himself seated in an anteroom his eyes fixed with hypnotic intensity upon the frosted pane of an adjoining door whereon in gold letters was inscribed the word in the end presley had been surprised to find that shelgrim was still in
it was already very late after six oclock and the other offices in the building were in the act of closing
many of them were already deserted
at every instant through the open door of the anteroom he caught a glimpse of clerks office boys bookkeepers and other employees hurrying towards the stairs and elevators quitting business for the day
shelgrim it seemed still remained at his desk knowing no fatigue requiring no leisure
what time does mr shelgrim usually go home inquired presley of the young man who sat ruling forms at the table in the anteroom
anywhere between halfpast six and seven the other answered adding very often he comes back in the evening
and the man was seventy years old
presley could not repress a murmur of astonishment
not only mentally then was the president of the and a giant
seventy years of age and still at his post holding there with the energy with a concentration of purpose that would have wrecked the health and impaired the mind of many men in the prime of their manhood
but the next instant presley set his teeth
it is an ogres vitality he said to himself
just so is the maneating tiger strong
the man should have energy who has sucked the lifeblood from an entire people
a little electric bell on the wall near at hand trilled a warning
the young man who was ruling forms laid down his pen and opening the door of the office thrust in his head then after a word exchanged with the unseen occupant of the room he swung the door wide saying to presley mr shelgrim will see you sir
presley entered a large well lighted but singularly barren office
a wellworn carpet was on the floor two steel engravings hung against the wall an extra chair or two stood near a large plain littered table
that was absolutely all unless he excepted the corner washstand on which was set a pitcher of ice water covered with a clean stiff napkin
a man evidently some sort of managers assistant stood at the end of the table leaning on the back of one of the chairs
shelgrim himself sat at the table
he was large almost to massiveness
an irongrey beard and a mustache that completely hid the mouth covered the lower part of his face
his eyes were a pale blue and a little watery here and there upon his face were moth spots
but the enormous breadth of the shoulders was what at first most vividly forced itself upon notice
never had he seen a broader man the neck however seemed in a manner to have settled into the shoulders and furthermore they were humped and rounded as if to bear great responsibilities and great abuse
at the moment he was wearing a silk skullcap pushed to one side and a little awry a frock coat of broadcloth with long sleeves and a waistcoat from the lower buttons of which the cloth was worn and upon the edges rubbed away showing the metal underneath
at the top this waistcoat was unbuttoned and in the shirt front disclosed were two pearl studs
presley uninvited unnoticed apparently sat down
the assistant manager was in the act of making a report
his voice was not lowered and presley heard every word that was spoken
the report proved interesting
it concerned a bookkeeper in the office of the auditor of disbursements
it seems he was at most times thoroughly reliable hardworking industrious ambitious
but at long intervals the vice of drunkenness seized upon the man and for three days rode him like a hag
not only during the period of this intemperance but for the few days immediately following the man was useless his work untrustworthy
he was a family man and earnestly strove to rid himself of his habit he was when sober valuable
in consideration of these facts he had been pardoned again and again
you remember mr shelgrim observed the manager that you have more than once interfered in his behalf when we were disposed to let him go
i donot think we can do anything with him sir
he promises to reform continually but it is the same old story
this last time we saw nothing of him for four days
honestly mr shelgrim i think we ought to let tentell out
we canot afford to keep him
he is really losing us too much money the order ready now if you care to let it go
there was a pause
presley all attention listened breathlessly
the assistant manager laid before his president the typewritten order in question
the silence lengthened in the hall outside the wroughtiron door of the elevator cage slid to with a clash
shelgrim did not look at the order
he turned his swivel chair about and faced the windows behind him looking out with unseeing eyes
at last he spoke tentell has a family wife and three children
how much do we pay him
one hundred and thirty double that or say two hundred and fifty see how that will do you say so but really mr shelgrim well well try that anyhow
presley had not time to readjust his perspective to this new point of view of the president of the and before the assistant manager had withdrawn
shelgrim wrote a few memoranda on his calendar pad and signed a couple of letters before turning his attention to presley
at last he looked up and fixed the young man with a direct grave glance
he did not smile
it was some time before he spoke
at last he said well sir
presley advanced and took a chair nearer at hand
shelgrim turned and from his desk picked up and consulted card
presley observed that he read without the use of glasses
you he said again facing about you are the young man who wrote the poem called the toilers yes sir
it seems to have made a great deal of talk read it and seen the picture in house the picture you took the idea from
presley his senses never more alive observed that curiously enough shelgrim did not move his body
his arms moved and his head but the great bulk of the man remained immobile in its place and as the interview proceeded and this peculiarity emphasised itself presley began to conceive the odd idea that shelgrim had as it were placed his body in the chair to rest while his head and brain and hands went on working independently
a saucer of shelled filberts stood near his elbow and from time to time he picked up one of these in a great thumb and forefinger and put it between his teeth seen the picture called the toilers continued shelgrim and of the two i like the picture better than the poem
the picture is by a master presley hastened to interpose
and for that reason said shelgrim it leaves nothing more to be said
you might just as well have kept quiet only one best way to say anything
and what has made the picture of the toilers great is that the artist said in it the that could be said on the subject had never looked at it in just that light observed presley
he was confused all at sea embarrassed
what he had expected to find in shelgrim he could not have exactly said
but he had been prepared to come upon an ogre a brute a terrible man of blood and iron and instead had discovered a sentimentalist and an art critic
no standards of measurement in his mental equipment would apply to the actual man and it began to dawn upon him that possibly it was not because these standards were different in kind but that they were lamentably deficient in size
he began to see that here was the man not only great but large manysided of vast sympathies who understood with equal intelligence the human nature in an habitual drunkard the ethics of a masterpiece of painting and the financiering and operation of ten thousand miles of railroad had never looked at it in just that light repeated presley
there is a great deal in what you say
if i am to listen continued shelgrim to that kind of talk i prefer to listen to it first hand
i would rather listen to what the great french painter has to say than to what have to say about what he has already said
his speech loud and emphatic at first when the idea of what he had to say was fresh in his mind lapsed and lowered itself at the end of his sentences as though he had already abandoned and lost interest in that thought so that the concluding words were indistinct beneath the grey beard and mustache
also at times there was the faintest suggestion of a lisp wrote that poem hazarded presley at a time when i was terribly upset
i live he concluded or did live on the los muertos ranch in tulare ranch
the ranch to mr derrick observed shelgrim
presley spread out his hands with a helpless resigned gesture
and continued the president of the and with grave intensity looking at presley keenly suppose you believe i am a grand old rascal believe answered presley am persuaded he hesitated searching for his words
believe this young man exclaimed shelgrim laying a thick powerful forefinger on the table to emphasise his words try to believe begin where there is a demand sooner or later there will be a supply
mr derrick does he grow his wheat
the wheat grows itself
what does he count for
does he supply the force
what do i count for
do i build the railroad
you are dealing with forces young man when you speak of wheat and the railroads not with men
there is the wheat the supply
it must be carried to feed the people
there is the demand
the wheat is one force the railroad another and there is the law that governs and demand
men have only little to do in the whole business
complications may arise conditions that bear hard on the him as inevitably as it will grow
if you want to fasten the blame of the affair at los muertos on any one person you will make a mistake
blame conditions not men faltered presley you are the head you control the road
you are a very young man
control the road
can i stop it
i can go into bankruptcy if you like
but otherwise if i run my road as a business proposition i can do nothing
i can not control it
it is a force born out of certain conditions and stop it or control it
can your mr derrick stop the wheat growing
he can burn his crop or he can give it away or sell it for a cent a as i could go into otherwise his wheat must grow
can any one stop the wheat
well then no more can i stop the road
presley regained the street stupefied his brain in a whirl
this new idea this new conception dumfounded him
somehow he could not deny it
it rang with the clear reverberation of truth
was no one then to blame for the horror at the irrigating ditch
forces conditions laws of supply and these then the enemies after all
not enemies there was no malevolence in nature
colossal indifference only a vast trend toward appointed goals
nature was then a gigantic engine a vast cyclopean power huge terrible a leviathan with a heart of steel knowing no compunction no forgiveness no tolerance crushing out the human atom standing in its way with nirvanic calm the agony of destruction sending never a jar never the faintest tremour through all that prodigious mechanism of wheels and cogs
he went to his club and ate his supper alone in gloomy agitation
he was sombre brooding lost in a dark maze of gloomy reflections
however just as he was rising from the table an incident occurred that for the moment roused him and sharply diverted his mind
his table had been placed near a window and as he was sipping his afterdinner coffee he happened to glance across the street
his eye was at once caught by the sight of a familiar figure
was it minna hooven
the figure turned the street corner and was lost to sight but it had been strangely like
on the moment presley had risen from the table and clapping on his hat had hurried into the streets where the lamps were already beginning to shine
but search though he would presley could not again come upon the young woman in whom he fancied he had seen the daughter of the unfortunate german
at last he gave up the hunt and returning to his this hour almost a few cigarettes vainly attempted to read from a volume of essays in the library and at last nervous distraught exhausted retired to his bed
but none the less presley had not been mistaken
the girl whom he had tried to follow had been indeed minna hooven
when minna a week before this time had returned to the lodging house on castro street after a days unsuccessful effort to find employment and was told that her mother and hilda had gone she was struck speechless with surprise and dismay
she had never before been in any town larger than bonneville and now knew not which way to turn nor how to account for the disappearance of her mother and little hilda
that the landlady was on the point of turning them out she understood but it had been agreed that the family should be allowed to stay yet one more day in the hope that minna would find work
of this she reminded the landlady
but this latter at once launched upon her such a torrent of vituperation that the girl was frightened to speechless submission
oh oh she faltered know
i am sorry
i know we owe you money but where did my mother go
i only want to find her
oh i ainot going to be bothered shrilled the other
how do i know
the truth of the matter was that mrs hooven afraid to stay in the vicinity of the house after her eviction and threatened with arrest by the landlady if she persisted in hanging around had left with the woman a note scrawled on an old blotter to be given to minna when she returned
this the landlady had lost
to cover her confusion she affected a vast indignation and a turbulent irascible demeanour ainot going to be bothered with such cattle as you she vociferated in face donot know where your folks is
me i only have dealings with honest people
i ainot got a word to say so long as the rent is paid
but when soldiered out of a weeks lodging then done
you get right along now
i donot know you
i ainot going to have my place get a bad name by having any south of market street chippies hanging around
you get along or call an officer
minna sought the street her head in a whirl
it was about five oclock
in her pocket was thirtyfive cents all she had in the world
what now
all at once the terror of the city that blind unreasoned fear that only the outcast knows swooped upon her and clutched her vulturewise by the throat
her first few days experience in the matter of finding employment had taught her just what she might expect from this new world upon which she had been thrown
what was to become of her
what was she to do where was she to go
unanswerable grim questions and now she no longer had herself to fear for
her mother and the baby little hilda both of them equally unable to look after themselves what was to become of them where were they gone
lost lost all of them herself as well
but she rallied herself as she walked along
the idea of her starving of her mother and hilda starving was out of all reason
of course it would not come to that of course not
it was not thus that starvation came
something would happen of course it time
but meanwhile meanwhile how to get through this approaching night and the next few days
that was the thing to think of just now
the suddenness of it all was what most unnerved her
during all the nineteen years of her life she had never known what it meant to shift for herself
her father had always sufficed for the family he had taken care of her then all of a sudden her father had been killed her mother snatched from her
then all of a sudden there was no help anywhere
then all of a sudden a terrible voice demanded of her now just what can you do to keep yourself alive
life faced her she looked the huge stone image squarely in the lustreless eyes
it was nearly twilight
minna for the sake of avoiding it seemed to her that now a thousand prying glances followed a demeanour and began to walk briskly toward the business quarter of the town
she was dressed neatly enough in a blue cloth skirt with a blue plush belt fairly decent shoes once her mothers a pink shirt waist and jacket and a straw sailor
she was in an unusual fashion pretty
even her troubles had not dimmed the bright light of her pale greenishblue eyes nor faded the astonishing redness of her lips nor hollowed her strangely white face
her blueblack hair was trim
she carried her wellshaped wellrounded figure erectly
even in her distress she observed that men looked keenly at her and sometimes after her as she went along
but this she noted with a dim subconscious faculty
the real minna harassed terrified lashed with a thousand anxieties kept murmuring under her breath what shall i do what shall i do oh what shall i do now
after an interminable walk she gained kearney street and held it till the welllighted wellkept neighbourhood of the shopping district gave place to the vicecrowded saloons and concert halls of the barbary coast
she turned aside in avoidance of this only to plunge into the purlieus of chinatown whence only she emerged panicstricken and out of breath after a half hour of terrors and at a time when it had grown quite dark
on the corner of california and dupont streets she stood a long moment pondering do something she said to herself must do she was tired out by now and the idea occurred to her to enter the catholic church in whose shadow she stood and sit down and rest
this she did
the evening service was just being concluded
but long after the priests and altar boys had departed from the chancel minna still sat in the dim echoing interior confronting her desperate situation as best she might
two or three hours later the sexton woke her
the church was being closed she must leave
once more chilled with the sharp night air numb with long sitting in the same attitude still oppressed with drowsiness confused frightened minna found herself on the pavement
she began to be hungry and at length yielding to the demand that every moment grew more imperious bought and eagerly devoured a fivecent bag of fruit
then once more she took up the round of walking
at length in an obscure street that branched from kearney street near the corner of the plaza she came upon an illuminated sign bearing the inscription beds for the night and cents
fifteen cents
could she afford it
it would leave her with only that much more that much between herself and a state of privation of which she dared not think and besides the forbidding look of the building frightened her
it was dark gloomy dirty a place suggestive of obscure crimes and hidden terrors
for twenty minutes or half an hour she hesitated walking twice and three times around the block
at last she made up her mind
exhaustion such as she had never known weighed like lead upon her shoulders and dragged at her heels
she must sleep
she could not walk the streets all night
she entered the doorway under the sign and found her way up a filthy flight of stairs
at the top a man in a blue checked jumper was filling a lamp behind a high desk
to him minna applied should like she faltered to have a bed for the night
one of those for fifteen cents will be good enough i think
well this place is only for men said the man looking up from the lamp
oh said minna didnot know
she looked at him stupidly and he with equal stupidity returned the gaze
thus for a long moment they held each others eyes didnot know repeated minna
yes its for men repeated the other
she slowly descended the stairs and once more came out upon the streets
and upon those streets that as the hours advanced grew more and more deserted more and more silent more and more oppressive with the sense of the bitter hardness of life towards those who have no means of living minna hooven spent the first night of her struggle to keep her head above the ebbtide of the citys sea into which she had been plunged
morning came and with it renewed hunger
at this time she had found her way uptown again and towards ten oclock was sitting upon a bench in a little park full of nursemaids and children
a group of the maids drew their babybuggies to bench and sat down continuing a conversation they had already begun
minna listened
a friend of one of the maids had suddenly thrown up her position leaving her madame in what would appear to have been deserved embarrassment
oh said minna breaking in and lying with sudden unwonted fluency am a nursegirl
i am out of a place
do you think i could get that one
the group turned and fixed evidently a country a supercilious indifference
well you might try said one of them
got good references
references repeated minna blankly
she did not know what this meant
oh mrs field ainot the kind to stick about references spoke up the other that soft
why anybody could work her go there said minna
have you the address
it was told to her
lorin she murmured
is that out of town
well its across the bay
across the bay
um from the country ainot you
yes do i get there
is it far
well you take the ferry at the foot of market street and then the train on the other side
no it ainot very far
just ask any one down there tell you
it was a chance but minna after walking down to the ferry slips found that the round trip would cost her twenty cents
if the journey proved fruitless only a dime would stand between her and the end of everything
but it was a chance the only one that had as yet presented itself
she made the trip
and upon the streetrailway cars upon the ferryboats on the locomotives and waycoaches of the local trains she was reminded of her fathers death and of the giant power that had reduced her to her present straits by the letters and to her mind they occurred everywhere
she seemed to see them in every direction
she fancied herself surrounded upon every hand by the long arms of the monster
minute after minute her hunger gnawed at her
she could not keep her mind from it
as she sat on the boat she found herself curiously scanning the faces of the passengers wondering how long since such a one had breakfasted how long before this other should sit down to lunch
when minna descended from the train at lorin on the other side of the bay she found that the place was one of those suburban towns not yet become fashionable such as may be seen beyond the outskirts of any large american city
all along the line of the railroad thereabouts houses small villascontractors scattered the advantages of suburban lots and sites for homes being proclaimed in sevenfoot letters upon mammoth billboards close to the right of way
without much trouble minna found the house to which she had been directed a pretty little cottage set back from the street and shaded by palms live oaks and the inevitable eucalyptus
her heart warmed at the sight of it
oh to find a little niche for herself here a home a refuge from those horrible city streets from the rat of famine with its relentless tooth
how she would work how strenuously she would endeavour to please how patient of rebuke she would be how faithful how conscientious
nor were her pretensions altogether false upon her while at home had devolved almost continually the care of the baby hilda her little sister
she knew the wants and needs of children
her heart beating her breath failing she rang the bell set squarely in the middle of the front door
the lady of the house herself an elderly lady with pleasant kindly face opened the door
minna stated her errand
but i have already engaged a girl she said
oh murmured minna striving with all her might to maintain appearances thought perhaps she turned away sorry said the lady
then she added would you care to look after so many as three little children and help around in light housework between whiles
yes maam
because my lives in north berkeley above looking far a girl
have you had lots of experience
got good references
yes maam
well give you the address
she lives up in north berkeley
she turned back into the house a moment and returned handing minna a card where she not to it child the inks wet had better see her
is it far
could i walk there
my no you better take the electric cars about six blocks above here
when minna arrived in north berkeley she had no money left
by a cruel mistake she had taken a car going in the wrong direction and though her error was rectified easily enough it had cost her her last fivecent piece
she was now to try her last hope
promptly it crumbled away
like the former this place had been already filled and minna left the door of the house with the certainty that her chance had come to naught and that now she entered into the last struggle with death of her last pitiful defence her last safeguard her last penny
as she once more resumed her interminable walk she realised she was weak faint and she knew that it was the weakness of complete exhaustion and the faintness of approaching starvation
was this the end coming on
terror of death aroused her
i do something oh anything
i must have something to eat
at this late hour the idea of pawning her little jacket occurred to her but now she was far away from the city and its pawnshops and there was no getting back
she walked on
an hour passed
she lost her sense of direction became confused knew not where she was going turned corners and went up bystreets without knowing why anything to keep moving for she fancied that so soon as she stood still the rat in the pit of her stomach gnawed more eagerly
at last she entered what seemed to be if not a park at least some sort of public enclosure
there were many trees the place was beautiful wellkept roads and walks led sinuously and invitingly underneath the shade
through the trees upon the other side of a wide expanse of turf brown and sear under the summer sun she caught a glimpse of tall buildings and a flagstaff
the whole place had a vaguely public educational appearance and minna guessed from certain notices affixed to the trees warning the public against the picking of flowers that she had found her way into the grounds of the state university
she went on a little further
the path she was following led her at length into a grove of gigantic live oaks whose lower branches all but swept the ground
here the grass was green the few flowers in bloom the shade very thick
a more lovely spot she had seldom seen
near at hand was a bench built around the trunk of the largest live oak and here at length weak from hunger exhausted to the limits of her endurance despairing abandoned minna hooven sat down to enquire of herself what next she could do
but once seated the demands of the she could more clamorous more insistent
to eat to rest to be safely housed against another night above all else these were the things she craved and the craving within her grew so mighty that she crisped her poor starved hands into little fists in an agony of desire while the tears ran from her eyes and the sobs rose thick from her breast and struggled and strangled in her aching throat
but in a few moments minna was aware that a woman apparently of some thirty years of age had twice passed along the walk in front of the bench where she sat and now as she took more notice of her she remembered that she had seen her on the ferryboat coming over from the city
the woman was gowned in silk tightly corseted and wore a hat of rather ostentatious smartness
minna became convinced that the person was watching her but before she had a chance to act upon this conviction she was surprised out of all countenance by the stranger coming up to where she sat and speaking to her
here is a coincidence exclaimed the newcomer as she sat down surely you are the young girl who sat opposite me on the boat
strange i should come across you again had you in mind ever since
on this nearer view minna observed that the womans face bore rather more than a trace of enamel and that the atmosphere about was impregnated with sachet
she was not otherwise conspicuous but there was a certain hardness about her mouth and a certain droop of fatigue in her eyelids which combined with an indefinite selfconfidence of manner held attention
do you know continued the woman believe you are in trouble
i thought so when i saw you on the boat and i think so now
are you
are you in trouble from the country ainot you
minna glad to find a sympathiser even in this chance acquaintance admitted that she was in distress that she had become separated from her mother and that she was indeed from the country been trying to find a situation she hazarded in conclusion but i donot seem to succeed never been in a city before except bonneville
well it a coincidence said the other know i wasnot drawn to you for nothing
i am looking for just such a young girl as you
you see i live alone a good deal and been wanting to find a nice bright sociable girl who will be a sort of to me
understand
and theres something about you that i like
i took to you the moment i saw you on the boat
now shall we talk this over
towards the end of the week one afternoon as presley was returning from his club he came suddenly face to face with minna upon a street corner
ah he cried coming toward her joyfully
upon my word i had almost given you up been looking everywhere for you
i was afraid you might not be getting along and i wanted to see if there was anything i could do
how are your mother and hilda
where are you stopping
have you got a good place donot know where mamma is answered minna
we got separated and i never have been able to find her again
meanwhile presley had been taking in with a quick eye the details of silk dress with its garniture of lace its edging of velvet its silver beltbuckle
her hair was arranged in a new way and on her head was a wide hat with a flare to one side set off with a gilt buckle and a puff of bright blue plush
he glanced at her sharply
well how are you getting on he demanded
minna laughed scornfully she cried
oh gone to hell
it was either that or starvation
presley regained his room at the club white and trembling
worse than the worst he had feared had happened
he had not been soon enough to help
he had failed again
a superstitious fear assailed him that he was in a manner marked that he was foredoomed to fail
minna had been driven to this and he acting too late upon his tardy resolve had not been able to prevent it
were the horrors then never to end
was the grisly spectre of consequence to forever dance in his vision
were the results the farreaching results of that battle at the irrigating ditch to cross his path forever
when would the affair be terminated the incident closed
where was that spot to which the tentacle of the monster could not reach
by now he was sick with the dread of it all
he wanted to get away to be free from that endless misery so that he might not see what he could no longer help
cowardly he now knew himself to be
he thought of himself only with loathing
bitterly selfcontemptuous that he could bring himself to a participation in such trivialities he began to dress to keep his engagement to dine with the cedarquists
he arrived at the house nearly half an hour late but before he could take off his overcoat mrs cedarquist appeared in the doorway of the drawingroom at the end of the hall
she was dressed as if to go out
my presley she exclaimed her stout overdressed body bustling toward him with a great rustle of silk never was so glad
you poor dear poet you are thin as a ghost
you need a better dinner than i can give you and that is just what you are to have
have i blundered
presley hastened to exclaim
did not mr cedarquist mention friday evening
no no no she cried it was he who blundered blundering in a social amenity
preposterous
no mr cedarquist forgot that we were dining out ourselves tonight and when he told me he had asked you here for the same evening i fell upon the man my dear i did actually tooth and nail
but i wouldnot hear of his wiring you
i just dropped a note to our hostess asking if i could not bring you and when i told her who you she received the idea with oh empressement
so there it is all settled
cedarquist and the girls are gone on ahead and you are to take the old lady like a dear dear poet
i believe i hear the carriage
allons
en voiture
once settled in the cool gloom of the coupe odorous of leather and upholstery mrs cedarquist exclaimed and never told you who you were to dine with oh a personage really
fancy you will be in the camp of your dearest foes
you are to dine with the gerard people one of the vicepresidents of your bete noir the and railroad
presley started his fists clenching so abruptly as to all but split his white gloves
he was not conscious of what he said in reply and mrs cedarquist was so taken up with her own endless stream of talk that she did not observe his confusion
their daughter honora is going to europe next week her mother is to take her and mrs gerard is to have just a few people to informal you knowourselves you and oh i donot know two or three others
have you ever seen honora
the prettiest little thing and will she be rich
millions i would not dare say how many
tiens
nous voici
the coupe drew up to the curb and presley followed mrs cedarquist up the steps to the massive doors of the great house
in a confused daze he allowed one of the footmen to relieve him of his hat and coat in a daze he rejoined mrs cedarquist in a room with a glass roof hung with pictures the art gallery no doubt and in a daze heard their names announced at the entrance of another room the doors of which were hung with thick blue curtains
he entered collecting his wits for the introductions and presentations that he foresaw impended
the room was very large and of excessive loftiness
flat rectagonal pillars of a rosetinted variegated marble rose from the floor almost flush with the walls finishing off at the top with gilded capitals of a corinthian design which supported the ceiling
the ceiling itself instead of joining the walls at right angles curved to meet them a device that produced a sort of domelike effect
this ceiling was a maze of golden involutions in very high relief that adjusted themselves to form a massive framing for a great picture nymphs and goddesses white doves golden chariots and the like all wreathed about with clouds and garlands of roses
between the pillars around the sides of the room were hangings of silk the a louis quinze beautiful simplicity and faultless taste
the fireplace was a marvel
it reached from floor to ceiling the lower parts black marble carved into crouching atlases with great muscles that upbore the superstructure
the design of this latter of a kind of purple marble shot through with white veinings was in the same style as the design of the silk hangings
in its midst was a bronze escutcheon bearing an undecipherable monogram and a latin motto
andirons of brass nearly six feet high flanked the hearthstone
the windows of the room were heavily draped in sombre brocade and ecru lace in which the initials of the family were very beautifully worked
but directly opposite the fireplace an extra window lighted from the adjoining conservatory threw a wonderful rich light into the apartment
it was a gothic window of stained glass very large the centre figures being armed warriors parsifal and lohengrin the one with a banner the other with a swan
the effect was exquisite the window a veritable masterpiece glowing flaming and burning with a hundred tints and coloursopalescent purple winered clouded pinks royal blues saffrons violets so dark as to be almost black
under foot the carpet had all the softness of texture of grass skins one of them of an enormous polar bear and rugs of silk velvet were spread upon the floor
a renaissance cabinet of ebony many feet taller than head and inlaid with ivory and silver occupied one corner of the room while in its centre stood a vast table of flemish oak black heavy as iron massive
a faint odour of sandalwood pervaded the air
from the conservatory nearby came the splashing of a fountain
a row of electric bulbs let into the frieze of the walls between the golden capitals and burning dimly behind hemispheres of clouded glass threw a subdued light over the whole scene
mrs gerard came forward
this is mr presley of course our new poet of whom we are all so proud
i was so afraid you would be unable to come
you have given me a real pleasure in allowing me to welcome you here
the footman appeared at her elbow
dinner is served madame he announced
when mrs hooven had left the boardinghouse on castro street she had taken up a position on a neighbouring corner to wait for reappearance
little hilda at this time hardly more than six years of age was with her holding to her hand
mrs hooven was by no means an old woman but hard work had aged her
she no longer had any claim to good looks
she no longer took much interest in her personal appearance
at the time of her eviction from the castro street boardinghouse she wore a faded black bonnet garnished with faded artificial flowers of dirty pink
a plaid shawl was about her shoulders
but this day of misfortune had set mrs hooven adrift in even worse condition than her daughter
her purse containing a miserable handful of dimes and nickels was in her trunk and her trunk was in the hands of the landlady
minna had been allowed such reprieve as her thirtyfive cents would purchase
the destitution of mrs hooven and her little girl had begun from the very moment of her eviction
while she waited for minna watching every street car and every approaching pedestrian a policeman appeared asked what she did and receiving no satisfactory reply promptly moved her on
minna had had little assurance in facing the life struggle of the city
mrs hooven had absolutely none
in her grief distress the pinch of poverty and above all the nameless fear of the turbulent fierce life of the streets had produced a numbness an embruted sodden silent speechless condition of dazed mind and clogged unintelligent speech
she was dumb bewildered stupid animated but by a single impulse
she clung to life and to the life of her little daughter hilda with the blind tenacity of purpose of a drowning cat
thus when ordered to move on by the officer she had silently obeyed not even attempting to explain her situation
she walked away to the next streetcrossing
then in a few moments returned taking up her place on the corner near the boardinghouse spying upon the approaching cable cars peeping anxiously down the length of the sidewalks
once more the officer ordered her away and once more unprotesting she complied
but when for the third time the policeman found her on the forbidden spot he had lost his temper
this time when mrs hooven departed he had followed her and when bewildered persistent she had attempted to turn back he caught her by the shoulder
do you want to get arrested hey he demanded
do you want me to lock you up
say do you speak up
the ominous words at length reached mrs comprehension
arrested
she was to be arrested
the countrywomans fear of the jail nipped and bit eagerly at her unwilling heels
she hurried off thinking to return to her post after the policeman should have gone away
but when at length turning back she tried to find the boardinghouse she suddenly discovered that she was on an unfamiliar street
unwittingly no doubt she had turned a corner
she could not retrace her steps
she and hilda were lost
mammy tired hilda complained
her mother picked her up
mammy wherere we gowun mammy
where indeed
stupefied mrs hooven looked about her at the endless blocks of buildings the endless procession of vehicles in the streets the endless march of pedestrians on the sidewalks
where was minna where was she and her baby to sleep that night
how was hilda to be fed
she could not stand still
there was no place to sit down but one thing was left walk
ah that via dolorosa of the destitute that chemin de la croix of the homeless
ah the mile after mile of granite pavement that be be traversed
walk they must
move they must onward forward whither they cannot tell why they do not know
walk walk walk with bleeding feet and smarting joints walk with aching back and trembling knees walk though the senses grow giddy with fatigue though the eyes droop with sleep though every nerve demanding rest sets in motion its tiny alarm of pain
death is at the end of that devious winding maze of paths crossed and recrossed and crossed again
there is but one goal to the via dolorosa there is no escape from the central chamber of that labyrinth
fate guides the feet of them that are set therein
double on their steps though they may weave in and out of the myriad corners of the citys streets return go forward back from side to side here there anywhere dodge twist wind the central chamber where death sits is reached inexorably at the end
sometimes leading and sometimes carrying hilda mrs hooven set off upon her objectless journey
block after block she walked street after street
she was afraid to stop because of the policemen
as often as she so much as slackened her pace she was sure to see one of these terrible figures in the distance watching her so it seemed to her waiting for her to halt for the fraction of a second in order that he might have an excuse to arrest her
hilda fretted incessantly
mammy wherere we gowun
mammy tired
then at last for the first time that plaint that stabbed the mothers heart mammy hungry
be quiut den said mrs hooven
bretty soon well hev der subber on the sidewalk men and women in the great six oclock homeward march jostled them as they went along
with dumb dull curiousness she looked into one after another of the limitless stream of faces and she fancied she saw in them every emotion but pity
the faces were gay were anxious were sorrowful were mirthful were lined with thought or were merely flat and expressionless but not one was turned toward her in compassion
the expressions of the faces might be various but an underlying callousness was discoverable beneath every mask
the people seemed removed from her immeasurably they were infinitely above her
what was she to them she and her baby the crippled outcasts of the human herd the unfit not able to survive thrust out on the heath to perish
to beg from these people did not yet occur to her
there was no pride however in the matter
she would have as readily asked alms of so many sphinxes
she went on
without willing it her feet carried her in a wide circle
soon she began to recognise the houses she had been in that street before
somehow this was distasteful to her so striking off at right angles she walked straight before her for over a dozen blocks
by now it was growing darker
the sun had set
the hands of a clock on the powerhouse of a cable line pointed to seven
no doubt minna had come long before this time had found her mother gone and what had she done just what she do
where was her daughter now
walking the streets herself no doubt
what was to become of minna pretty girl that she was lost houseless and friendless in the maze of these streets
mrs hooven roused from her lethargy could not repress an exclamation of anguish
here was misfortune indeed here was calamity
she bestirred herself and remembered the address of the boardinghouse
she might inquire her way back thither
no doubt by now the policeman would be gone home for the night
she looked about
she was in the district of modest residences and a young man was coming toward her carrying a new garden hose looped around his shoulder
say say blease the young man gave her a quick look and passed on hitching the coil of hose over his shoulder
but a few paces distant he slackened in his walk and fumbled in his vest pocket with his fingers
then he came back to mrs hooven and put a quarter into her hand
mrs hooven stared at the coin stupefied
the young man disappeared
he thought then that she was begging
it had come to that she independent all her life whose husband had held five hundred acres of wheat land had been taken for a beggar
a flush of shame shot to her face
she was about to throw the money after its giver
but at the moment hilda again exclaimed mammy hungry
with a movement of infinite lassitude and resigned acceptance of the situation mrs hooven put the coin in her pocket
she had no right to be proud any longer
hilda must have food
that evening she and her child had supper at a cheap restaurant in a poor quarter of the town and passed the night on the benches of a little uptown park
unused to the ways of the town ignorant as to the customs and possibilities of eatinghouses she spent the whole of her quarter upon supper for herself and hilda and had nothing left wherewith to buy a lodging
the night was dreadful hilda sobbed herself to sleep on her mothers shoulder waking thereafter from hour to hour to protest though wrapped in her mothers shawl that she was cold and to enquire why they did not go to bed
drunken men snored and sprawled near at hand
towards morning a loafer reeking of alcohol sat down beside her and indulged in an incoherent soliloquy punctuated with oaths and obscenities
it was not till far along towards daylight that she fell asleep
she awoke to find it broad day
her mothers limbs were stiff and lame with cold and damp her head throbbed
she moved to another bench which stood in the rays of the sun and for a long two hours sat there in the thin warmth till the moisture of the night that clung to her clothes was evaporated
a policeman came into view
she woke hilda and carrying her in her arms took herself away
mammy began hilda as soon as she was well awake mammy hungry
i want mein breakfest
sure sure soon now leedle tochter
she herself was hungry but she had but little thought of that
how was hilda to be fed
she remembered her experience of the previous day when the young man with the hose had given her money
was it so easy then to beg
could charity be had for the asking
so it seemed but all that was left of her sturdy independence revolted at the thought beg hold out the hand to strangers
mammy hungry
there was no other way
it must come to that in the end
why temporise why put off the inevitable
she sought out a frequented street where men and women were on their way to work
one after another she let them go by searching their faces deterred at the very last moment by some trifling variation of expression a firm set mouth a serious level eyebrow an advancing chin
then twice when she had made a choice and brought her resolution to the point of speech she quailed shrinking her ears tingling her whole being protesting against the degradation
every one must be looking at her
her shame was no doubt the object of an hundred eyes
mammy hungry protested hilda again
she made up her mind
what though was she to say
in what words did beggars ask for assistance
she tried to remember how tramps who had appeared at her back door on los muertos had addressed her how and with what formula certain mendicants of bonneville had appealed to her
then having settled upon a phrase she approached a whiskered gentleman with a large stomach walking briskly in the direction of the town
say den blease hellup a boor womun
the gentleman passed on
perhaps he doand hear me she murmured
two welldressed women advanced chattering gayly
say say den blease hellup a boor womun
one of the women paused murmuring to her companion and from her purse extracted a yellow ticket which she gave to mrs hooven with voluble explanations
but mrs hooven was confused she did not understand
what could the ticket mean
the women went on their way
the next person to whom she applied was a young girl of about eighteen very prettily dressed
say say den blease hellup a boor womun
in evident embarrassment the young girl paused and searched in her little pocketbook think i have just ten cents here somewhere she murmured again and again
in the end she found a dime and dropped it into mrs palm
that was the beginning
the first step once taken the others became easy
all day long mrs hooven and hilda followed the streets begging begging
here it was a nickel there a dime here a nickel again
but she was not expert in the art nor did she know where to buy food the cheapest and the entire days work resulted only in barely enough for two meals of bread milk and a wretchedly cooked stew
tuesday night found the pair once more shelterless
once more mrs hooven and her baby passed the night on the park benches
but early on wednesday morning mrs hooven found herself assailed by sharp pains and cramps in her stomach
what was the cause she could not say but as the day went on the pains increased alternating with hot flushes over all her body and a certain weakness and faintness
as the day went on the pain and the weakness increased
when she tried to walk she found she could do so only with the greatest difficulty
here was fresh misfortune
to beg she must walk
dragging herself forward a halfblock at a time she regained the street once more
she succeeded in begging a couple of nickels bought a bag of apples from a vender and returning to the park sank exhausted upon a bench
here she remained all day until evening hilda alternately whimpering for her bread and milk or playing languidly in the gravel walk at her feet
in the evening she started out again
this time it was bitter hard
nobody seemed inclined to give
twice she was moved on by policemen
two hours begging elicited but a single dime
with this she bought bread and milk and refusing herself to eat returned to the only home she spent the night shivering with cold burning with fever
from wednesday morning till friday evening with the exception of the few apples she had bought and a quarter of a loaf of hard bread that she found in a greasy of a workmans hooven had nothing to eat
in her weakened condition begging became hourly more difficult and such little money as was given her she resolutely spent on bread and milk in the morning and evening
by friday afternoon she was very weak indeed
her eyes troubled her
she could no longer see distinctly and at times there appeared to her curious figures huge crystal goblets of the most graceful shapes floating and swaying in the air in front of her almost within arms reach
vases of elegant forms made of shimmering glass bowed and courtesied toward her
glass bulbs took graceful and varying shapes before her vision now rounding into globes now evolving into hourglasses now twisting into pretzelshaped convolutions
mammy hungry insisted hilda passing her hands over her face
mrs hooven started and woke
it was friday evening
already the street lamps were being lit gome den leedle girl she said rising and taking hand
gome den we go vind subber hey
she issued from the park and took a cross street directly away from the locality where she had begged the previous days
she had had no success there of late
she would try some other quarter of the town
after a weary walk she came out upon van ness avenue near its junction with market street
she turned into the avenue and went on toward the bay painfully traversing block after block begging of all whom she met for she no longer made any distinction among the passersby
say say den blease hellup a boor womun
mammy mammy hungry
it was friday night between seven and eight
the great deserted avenue was already dark
a sea fog was scudding overhead and by degrees descending lower
the warmth was of the meagerest and the street lamps birds of fire in cages of glass fluttered and danced in the prolonged gusts of the trade wind that threshed and weltered in the city streets from off the ocean
presley entered the diningroom of the gerard mansion with little miss gerard on his arm
the other guests had preceded with mrs gerard a palefaced languid young man introduced to presley as julian lambert with cousin beatrice one of the twin daughters of mr and mrs cedarquist his brother stephen whose hair was straight as an but of a pallid straw color with sister gerard himself taciturn bearded rotund loud of breath escorted mrs cedarquist
besides these there were one or two other couples whose names presley did not remember
the diningroom was superb in its appointments
on three sides of the room to the height of some ten feet ran a continuous picture an oil painting divided into long sections by narrow panels of black oak
the painting represented the personages in the romaunt de la rose and was conceived in an atmosphere of the most delicate most ephemeral allegory
one saw young chevaliers blueeyed of elemental beauty and purity women with crowns gold girdles and cloudy wimples young girls entrancing in their loveliness wearing snowwhite kerchiefs their golden hair unbound and flowing dressed in white samite bearing armfuls of flowers the whole procession defiling against a background of forest glades venerable oaks halfhidden fountains and fields of asphodel and roses
otherwise the room was simple
against the side of the wall unoccupied by the picture stood a sideboard of gigantic size that once had adorned the banquet hall of an italian palace of the late renaissance
it was black with age and against its sombre surfaces glittered an array of heavy silver dishes and heavier cutglass bowls and goblets
the company sat down to the first course of raw blue point oysters served upon little pyramids of shaved ice and the two butlers at once began filling the glasses of the guests with cool haut sauterne
mrs gerard who was very proud of her dinners and never able to resist the temptation of commenting upon them to her guests leaned across to presley and mrs cedarquist murmuring mr presley do you find that sauterne too cold
i always believe it is so bourgeois to keep such a delicate wine as sauterne on the ice and to ice bordeaux or it is nothing short of a crime
this is from your own vineyard is it not asked julian lambert think i recognise the bouquet
he strove to maintain an attitude of fin gourmet unable to refrain from comment upon the courses as they succeeded one another
little honora gerard turned to presley you know she explained papa has his own vineyards in southern france
he is so particular about his wines turns up his nose at california wines
and i am to go there next summer
ferrieres is the name of the place where our vineyards are the dearest village
she was a beautiful little girl of a dainty porcelain type her colouring low in tone
she wore no jewels but her little undeveloped neck and shoulders of an exquisite immaturity rose from the tulle bodice of her first decollete gown
yes she continued to go to europe for the first time it be gay
and i am to have my own bonne and mamma and i are to many places baden homburg spa the tyrol it be gay
presley assented in meaningless words
he sipped his wine mechanically looking about that marvellous room with its subdued saffron lights its glitter of glass and silver its beautiful women in their elaborate toilets its deft correct servants its array of glass chased silver and dresden crockery
it was wealth in all its outward and visible forms the signs of an opulence so great that it need never be husbanded
it was the home of a railway magnate a railroad king
for this then the farmers paid
it was for this that behrman turned the screw tightened the vise
it was for this that dyke had been driven to outlawry and a jail
it was for this that lyman derrick had been bought the governor ruined and broken annixter shot down hooven killed
the soup puree a la derby was served and at the same time as hors doeuvres ortolan patties together with a tiny sandwich made of browned toast and thin slices of ham sprinkled over with parmesan cheese
the wine so mrs gerard caused it to be understood was xeres of the vintage
mrs hooven crossed the avenue
it was growing late
without knowing it she had come to a part of the city that experienced beggars shunned
there was nobody about
block after block of residences stretched away on either hand lighted full of people
but the sidewalks were deserted
mammy whimpered hilda tired carry me
using all her strength mrs hooven picked her up and moved on aimlessly
then again that terrible cry the cry of the hungry child appealing to the helpless mother mammy hungry
ach gott leedle girl exclaimed mrs hooven holding her close to her shoulder the tears starting from her eyes
ach leedle tochter
doand doand doand
you praik my hairt
i cenot vind any subber
we got noddings to eat noddings noddings
when do we have those breadn milk again mammy
hilda
i doand know what pecome oaf us now what pecome oaf my leedle babby
she went on holding hilda against her shoulder with one arm as best she might one hand steadying herself against the fence railings along the sidewalk
at last a solitary pedestrian came into view a young man in a top hat and overcoat walking rapidly
mrs hooven held out a quivering hand as he passed her
say say den blease hellup a boor womun
the other hurried on
the fish course was grenadins of bass and small salmon the latter stuffed and cooked in white wine and mushroom liquor have read your poem of course mr presley observed mrs gerard
toilers i mean
what a sermon you read us you dreadful young man
i felt that i ought at once to sell all that i have and give to the poor
positively it did stir me up
you may congratulate yourself upon making at least one convert
just because of that poem mrs cedarquist and i have started a movement to send a whole shipload of wheat to the starving people in india
now you horrid reactionnaire are you satisfied am very glad murmured presley
but i am afraid observed mrs cedarquist that we may be too late
they are dying so fast those poor people
by the time our ship reaches india the famine may be all over
one need never be afraid of being too late in the matter of helping the destitute answered presley
unfortunately they are always a fixed quantity
the poor ye have always with you how very clever that is said mrs gerard
mrs cedarquist tapped the table with her fan in mild applause
brilliant brilliant she murmured epigrammatical
honora said mrs gerard turning to her daughter at that moment in conversation with the languid lambert honora entendstu ma cherie lesprit de notre jeune lamartine
mrs hooven went on stumbling from street to street holding hilda to her breast
famine gnawed incessantly at her stomach walk though she might turn upon her tracks up and down the streets back to the avenue again incessantly and relentlessly the torture dug into her vitals
she was hungry hungry and if the want of food harassed and rended her fullgrown woman that she was what must it be in the poor starved stomach of her little girl
oh for some helping hand now oh for one little mouthful one little nibble
food food all her wrecked body clamoured for nourishment anything to numb those gnawing abandoned loaf hard mouldered a halfeaten fruit yes even the refuse of the gutter even the garbage of the ash heap
on she went peering into dark corners into the areaways anywhere everywhere watching the silent prowling of cats the intent rovings of stray dogs
but she was growing weaker the pains and cramps in her stomach returned weight bore her to the pavement
more than once a great giddiness a certain wheeling faintness all but overcame her
hilda however was asleep
to wake her would only mean to revive her to the consciousness of hunger yet how to carry her further
mrs hooven began to fear that she would fall with her child in her arms
the terror of a collapse upon those cold pavements glistening with fogdamp roused her she must make an effort to get through the night
she rallied all her strength and pausing a moment to shift the weight of her baby to the other arm once more set off through the night
a little while later she found on the edge of the sidewalk the peeling of a banana
it had been trodden upon and it was muddy but joyfully she caught it up
hilda she cried wake oop leedle girl
see loog den deres somedings to eat
look den hey goot ainot it
zum bunaner
but it could not be eaten
decayed dirty all but rotting the stomach turned from the refuse nauseated
no no cried hilda not good
i canot eat it
oh mammy please gif me those breadn milk
by now the guests of mrs gerard had come to the pheasants escallops of duck and rissolettes a la pompadour
the wine was chateau latour
all around the table conversations were going forward gayly
the good wines had broken up the slight restraint of the early part of the evening and a spirit of good humour and good fellowship prevailed
young lambert and mr gerard were deep in reminiscences of certain mutual duckshooting expeditions
mrs gerard and mrs cedarquist discussed a strange mingling of psychology degeneracy and analysis of erotic had just been translated from the italian
stephen lambert and beatrice disputed over the merits of a scotch collie just given to the young lady
the scene was gay the electric bulbs sparkled the wine flashing back the light
the entire table was a vague glow of white napery delicate china and glass as brilliant as crystal
behind the guests the servingmen came and went filling the glasses continually changing the covers serving the entrees managing the dinner without interruption confusion or the slightest unnecessary noise
but presley could find no enjoyment in the occasion
from that picture of feasting that scene of luxury that atmosphere of decorous wellbred refinement his thoughts went back to los muertos and quien sabe and the irrigating ditch at he saw them fall one by one harran annixter osterman broderson hooven
the clink of the wine glasses was drowned in the explosion of revolvers
the railroad might indeed be a force only which no man could control and for which no man was responsible but his friends had been killed but years of extortion and oppression had wrung money from all the san joaquin money that had made possible this very scene in which he found himself
because magnus had been beggared gerard had become railroad king because the farmers of the valley were poor these men were rich
the fancy grew big in his mind distorted caricatured terrible
because the farmers had been killed at the irrigation ditch these others gerard and his family fed full
they fattened on the blood of the people on the blood of the men who had been killed at the ditch
it was a halfludicrous halfhorrible dog eat dog an unspeakable cannibalism
harran annixter and hooven were being devoured there under his eyes
these dainty women his cousin beatrice and little miss gerard frail delicate all these fine ladies with their small fingers and slender necks suddenly were transfigured in his tortured mind into harpies tearing human flesh
his head swam with the horror of it the terror of it
yes the people turn some day and turning rend those who now preyed upon them
it would be dog eat dog again with positions reversed and he saw for one instant of time that splendid house sacked to its foundations the tables overturned the pictures torn the hangings blazing and liberty the redhanded man in the street grimed with powder smoke foul with the gutter rush yelling torch in hand through every door
at ten oclock mrs hooven fell
luckily she was leading hilda by the hand at the time and the little girl was not hurt
in vain had mrs hooven hour after hour walked the streets
after a while she no longer made any attempt to beg nobody was stirring nor did she even try to hunt for food with the stray dogs and cats
she had made up her mind to return to the park in order to sit upon the benches there but she had mistaken the direction and following up sacramento street had come out at length not upon the park but upon a great vacant lot at the very top of the clay street hill
the ground was unfenced and rose above her to form the cap of the hill all overgrown with bushes and a few stunted live oaks
it was in trying to cross this piece of ground that she fell
she got upon her feet again
ach mammy did you hurt yourself asked hilda
no no
is that house where we get those breadn milk
hilda pointed to a single rambling building just visible in the night that stood isolated upon the summit of the hill in a grove of trees
no no dere aindt no braid end miluk leedle tochter
hilda once more began to sob
ach mammy please i want it hungry
the jangled nerves snapped at last under the tension and mrs hooven suddenly shaking hilda roughly cried out stop stop
doand say ut egen you
my gott you kill me yet
but quick upon this came the reaction
the mother caught her little girl to her sinking down upon her knees putting her arms around her holding her close
no no gry all so mudge es you want
say dot you are hongry
say ut egen say ut all de dime ofer end ofer egen
say ut poor starfing leedle babby
oh mein poor leedle tochter
my gott oh i go crazy bretty soon i guess
i cenot hellup you
i cenot ged you noddings to eat noddings noddings
hilda we gowun to die togedder
put der arms roundt me soh tighd leedle babby
we gowun to die we gowun to vind popper
we aindt gowun to be hongry eny more
vair we go now demanded hilda
no places soh tiredt
we stop heir leedle while end rest
underneath a large bush that afforded a little shelter from the wind mrs hooven lay down taking hilda in her arms and wrapping her shawl about her
the infinite vast night expanded gigantic all around them
at this elevation they were far above the city
it was still
close overhead whirled the chariots of the fog galloping landward smothering lights blurring outlines
soon all sight of the town was shut out even the solitary house on the hilltop vanished
there was nothing left but grey wheeling fog and the mother and child alone shivering in a little strip of damp ground an island drifting aimlessly in empty space fingers touched a leaf from the bush and instinctively closed upon it and carried it to her mouth
mammy she said eating those leaf
is those good
her mother did not reply
you going to sleep mammy inquired hilda touching her face
mrs hooven roused herself a little
hey
vat you say
asleep
yais i guess i wass asleep
her voice trailed unintelligibly to silence again
she was not however asleep
her eyes were open
a grateful numbness had begun to creep over her a pleasing semiinsensibility
she no longer felt the pain and cramps of her stomach even the hunger was ceasing to bite
these stuffed artichokes are delicious mrs gerard murmured young lambert wiping his lips with a corner of his napkin
pardon me for mentioning it but your dinner must be my excuse
and this mr lambert has set the bad example observed mrs cedarquist so delicate such an exquisite flavour
how do you manage
we get all our asparagus from the southern part of the state from one particular ranch explained mrs gerard
we order it by wire and get it only twenty hours after cutting
my husband sees to it that it is put on a special train
it stops at this ranch just to take on our asparagus
extravagant isnot it but i simply cannot eat asparagus that has been cut more than a day
nor exclaimed julian lambert who posed as an epicure can tell to an hour just how long asparagus has been picked
fancy eating ordinary market asparagus said mrs gerard that has been fingered by heaven knows how many hands
mammy mammy wake up cried hilda trying to push open mrs eyelids at last closed
mammy donot just trying to frighten me
feebly hilda shook her by the shoulder
at last mrs lips stirred
putting her head down hilda distinguished the whispered words sick
go to to eat
the dessert was a wonderful preparation of alternate layers of biscuit glaces ice cream and candied chestnuts
delicious is it not observed julian lambert partly to himself partly to miss cedarquist
this moscovite my word i have never tasted its equal
and you should know shouldnot you returned the young lady
mammy mammy wake up cried hilda sleep so frightenedt
repeatedly she shook her repeatedly she tried to raise the inert eyelids with the point of her finger
but her mother no longer stirred
the gaunt lean body with its bony face and sunken eyesockets lay back prone upon the ground the feet upturned and showing the ragged worn soles of the shoes the forehead and grey hair beaded with fog the poor faded bonnet awry the poor faded dress soiled and torn
hilda drew close to her mother kissing her face twining her arms around her neck
for a long time she lay that way alternately sobbing and sleeping
then after a long time there was a stir
she woke from a doze to find a police officer and two or three other men bending over her
some one carried a lantern
terrified smitten dumb she was unable to answer the questions put to her
then a woman evidently a mistress of the house on the top of the hill arrived and took hilda in her arms and cried over her take the little girl she said to the police officer
but the mother can you save her
is she too far gone sent for a doctor replied the other
just before the ladies left the table young lambert raised his glass of madeira
turning towards the wife of the railroad king he said my best compliments for a delightful dinner
the doctor who had been bending over mrs hooven rose no use he said she has been dead some from starvation
on division number three of the los muertos ranch the wheat had already been cut and behrman on a certain morning in the first week of august drove across the open expanse of stubble toward the southwest his eyes searching the horizon for the feather of smoke that would mark the location of the steam harvester
however he saw nothing
the stubble extended onward apparently to the very margin of the world
at length behrman halted his buggy and brought out his field glasses from beneath the seat
he stood up in his place and adjusting the lenses swept the prospect to the south and west
it was the same as though the sea of land were in reality the ocean and he lost in an open boat were scanning the waste through his glasses looking for the smoke of a steamer hull down below the horizon
wonder he muttered if theyre working on four this morning
at length he murmured an ah of satisfaction
far to the south into the white sheen of sky immediately over the horizon he made out a faint harvester beyond doubt
thither behrman turned his horses head
it was all of an hours drive over the uneven ground and through the crackling stubble but at length he reached the harvester
he found however that it had been halted
the sack sewers together with the headerman were stretched on the ground in the shade of the machine while the engineer and separatorman were pottering about a portion of the works the matter billy demanded behrman reining up
the engineer turned about
the grain is heavy in here
we thought wed better increase the speed of the cupcarrier and pulled up to put in a smaller sprocket
behrman nodded to say that was all right and added a question
how is she going
anywheres from twentyfive to thirty sacks to the acre right along here nothing the matter with i guess
nothing in the world bill
one of the sack sewers interposed for the last half hour weve been throwing off three bags to the minute good thats good
it was more than good it was bonanza and all that division of the great ranch was thick with just such wonderful wheat
never had los muertos been more generous never a season more successful
behrman drew a long breath of satisfaction
he knew just how great was his share in the lands which had just been absorbed by the corporation he served just how many thousands of bushels of this marvellous crop were his property
through all these years of confusion bickerings open hostility and at last actual warfare he had waited nursing his patience calm with the firm assurance of ultimate success
the end at length had come he had entered into his reward and saw himself at last installed in the place he had so long so silently coveted saw himself chief of a principality the master of the wheat
the sprocket adjusted the engineer called up the gang and the men took their places
the fireman stoked vigorously the two sack sewers resumed their posts on the sacking platform putting on the goggles that kept the chaff from their eyes
the separatorman and headerman gripped their levers
the harvester shooting a column of thick smoke straight upward vibrating to the top of the stack hissed clanked and lurched forward
instantly motion sprang to life in all its component parts the header knives cutting a thirtysix foot swath gnashed like teeth beltings slid and moved like smooth flowing streams the separator whirred the agitator jarred and crashed cylinders augers fans seeders and elevators drapers and chaffcarriers clattered rumbled buzzed and clanged
the steam hissed and rasped the ground reverberated a hollow note and the thousands upon thousands of wheat stalks sliced and slashed in the clashing shears of the header rattled like dry rushes in a hurricane as they fell inward and were caught up by an endless belt to disappear into the bowels of the vast brute that devoured them
it was that and no less
it was the feeding of some prodigious monster insatiable with iron teeth gnashing and threshing into the fields of standing wheat devouring always never glutted never satiated swallowing an entire harvest snarling and slobbering in a welter of warm vapour acrid smoke and blinding pungent clouds of chaff
it moved bellydeep in the standing grain a hippopotamus halfmired in river ooze gorging rushes snorting sweating a dinosaur wallowing through thick hot grasses floundering there crouching grovelling there as its vast jaws crushed and tore and its enormous gullet swallowed incessant ravenous and inordinate
behrman very much amused changed places with one of the sack sewers allowing him to hold his horse while he mounted the sacking platform and took his place
the trepidation and jostling of the machine shook him till his teeth chattered in his head
his ears were shocked and assaulted by a myriadtongued clamour clashing steel straining belts jarring woodwork while the impalpable chaff powder from the separators settled like dust in his hair his ears eyes and mouth
directly in front of where he sat on the platform was the chute from the cleaner and from this into the mouth of a halffull sack spouted an unending gush of grain winnowed cleaned threshed ready for the mill
the pour from the chute of the cleaner had for behrman an immense satisfaction
without an instants pause a thick rivulet of wheat rolled and dashed tumultuous into the sack
in half a in twenty sack was full was passed over to the second sewer the mouth reeved up and the sack dumped out upon the ground to be picked up by the wagons and hauled to the railroad
behrman hypnotised sat watching that river of grain
all that shrieking bellowing machinery all that gigantic organism all the months of labour the ploughing the planting the prayers for rain the years of preparation the heartaches the anxiety the foresight all the whole business of the ranch the work of horses of steam of men and boys looked to this grain chute from the harvester into the sacks
its volume was the index of failure or success of riches or poverty
and at this point the labour of the rancher ended
here at the lip of the chute he parted company with his grain and from here the wheat streamed forth to feed the world
the yawning mouths of the sacks might well stand for the unnumbered mouths of the people all agape for food and here into these sacks at first so lean so flaccid attenuated like starved stomachs rushed the living stream of food insistent interminable filling the empty fattening the shrivelled making it sleek and heavy and solid
half an hour later the harvester stopped again
the men on the sacking platform had used up all the sacks
but foreman a new man on los muertos put in an appearance with the report that the wagon bringing a fresh supply was approaching
how is the grain elevator at port costa getting on sir
finished replied behrman
the new master of los muertos had decided upon accumulating his grain in bulk in a great elevator at the tidewater port where the grain ships for liverpool and the east took on their cargoes
to this end he had bought and greatly enlarged a building at port costa that was already in use for that purpose and to this elevator all the crop of los muertos was to be carried
the and made behrman a special rate
by the way said behrman to his superintendent in luck buyer was in bonneville yesterday buying for fallon and for holt too
i happened to run into him and sold a ship load ship load
of los muertos wheat acting for some indian famine relief of women people up in the wanted a whole cargo
i made a deal with him about fifty thousand tons of disengaged shipping in san francisco bay right now and ships are fighting for charters
i wired and got a long distance telephone from him this morning
he got me a barque the swanhilda dock day after tomorrow and begin loading
i better take a run up observed the superintendent and keep an eye on things
no answered behrman want you to stop down here and see that those carpenters hustle the work in the ranch house
derrick will be out by then
you see this deal is peculiar not selling to any to buyer
he only put me on to the thing acting direct with these women people and got to have some hand in shipping this stuff myself
but i made my selling figure cover the price of a charter a queer mixedup deal and i donot fancy it much but theres boodle in it go to port costa myself
a little later on in the day when behrman had satisfied himself that his harvesting was going forward favourably he reentered his buggy and driving to the county road turned southward towards the los muertos ranch house
he had not gone far however before he became aware of a familiar figure on horseback jogging slowly along ahead of him
he recognised presley he shook the reins over his horses back and very soon ranging up by the side of the young man passed the time of day with him
well what brings you down here again mr presley he observed thought we had seen the last of you came down to say goodbye to my friends answered presley shortly
going away
india
well upon my word
for your health hey
yes
you knocked up asserted the other
by the way he added suppose youve heard the news
presley shrank a little
of late the reports of disasters had followed so swiftly upon one another that he had begun to tremble and to quail at every unexpected bit of information
what news do you mean he asked
about dyke
he has been convicted
the judge sentenced him for life
for life
riding on by the side of this man through the ranches by the county road presley repeated these words to himself till the full effect of them burst at last upon him
jailed for life
no outlook
no hope for the future
day after day year after year to tread the rounds of the same gloomy monotony
he saw the grey stone walls the iron doors the flagging of the yard bare of grass or cell narrow bald cheerless the prison garb the prison fare and round all the grim granite of insuperable barriers shutting out the world shutting in the man with outcasts with the pariah dogs of society thieves murderers men below the beasts lost to all decency drugged with opium utter reprobates
to this dyke had been brought dyke than whom no man had been more honest more courageous more jovial
this was the end of him a prison this was his final estate a criminal
presley found an excuse for riding on leaving behrman behind him
he did not stop at saloon for the heat of his rage had long since begun to cool and dispassionately he saw things in their true light
for all the tragedy of his wifes death caraher was none the less an evil influence among the ranchers an influence that worked only to the inciting of crime
unwilling to venture himself to risk his own life the anarchist saloonkeeper had goaded dyke and presley both to murder a bad man a plague spot in the world of the ranchers poisoning the farmers bodies with alcohol and their minds with discontent
at last presley arrived at the ranch house of los muertos
the place was silent the grass on the lawn was half dead and over a foot high the beginnings of weeds showed here and there in the driveway
he tied his horse to a ring in the trunk of one of the larger eucalyptus trees and entered the house
mrs derrick met him in the diningroom
the old look of uneasiness almost of terror had gone from her wideopen brown eyes
there was in them instead the expression of one to whom a contingency long dreaded has arrived and passed
the stolidity of a settled grief of an irreparable calamity of a despair from which there was no escape was in her look her manner her voice
she was listless apathetic calm with the calmness of a woman who knows she can suffer no further
we are going away she told presley as the two sat down at opposite ends of the dining table
just magnus and there is left of us
there is very little money left magnus can hardly take care of himself to say nothing of me
i must look after him now
we are going to marysville
why there
you see she explained it happens that my old place is vacant in the seminary there
i am going back to teachliterature
she smiled wearily
it is beginning all over again isnot it
only there is nothing to look forward to now
magnus is an old man already and i must take care of him
he will go with you then presley said that will be some comfort to you at least donot know she said slowly you have not seen magnus lately
is do you mean he any better
would you like to see him
he is in the office
you can go right in
presley rose
he hesitated a moment then mrs annixter he asked she still with you
i should like to see her before i go
go in and see magnus said mrs derrick will tell her you are here
presley stepped across the stonepaved hallway with the glass roof and after knocking three times at the office door pushed it open and entered
magnus sat in the chair before the desk and did not look up as presley entered
he had the appearance of a man nearer eighty than sixty
all the oldtime erectness was broken and bent
it was as though the muscles that once had held the back rigid the chin high had softened and stretched
a certain fatness the obesity of inertia hung heavy around the hips and abdomen the eye was watery and vague the cheeks and chin unshaven and unkempt the grey hair had lost its forward curl towards the temples and hung thin and ragged around the ears
the hawklike nose seemed hooked to meet the chin the lips were slack the mouth halfopened
where once the governor had been a model of neatness in his dress the frock coat buttoned the linen clean he now sat in his shirt sleeves the waistcoat open and showing the soiled shirt
his hands were stained with ink and these the only members of his body that yet appeared to retain their activity were busy with a great pile of papersoblong legal documents that littered the table before him
without a moments cessation these hands of the came and went among the papers deft nimble dexterous
magnus was sorting papers
from the heap upon his left hand he selected a document opened it glanced over it then tied it carefully and laid it away upon a second pile on his right hand
when all the papers were in one pile he reversed the process taking from his right hand to place upon his left then back from left to right again then once more from right to left
he spoke no word he sat absolutely still even his eyes did not move only his hands swift nervous agitated seemed alive
why how are you governor said presley coming forward
magnus turned slowly about and looked at him and at the hand in which he shook his own
ah he said at length then his glance fell and he looked aimlessly about upon the floor come to say goodbye governor continued presley going away
going awayyes why its presley
presley
governor going away come to say goodbye
magnus bent his brows what are you saying goodbye for going away sir
the governor did not answer
staring at the ledge of the desk he seemed lost in thought
there was a long silence
then at length presley said how are you getting on governor
magnus looked up slowly
why its presley he said
how do you do presley
are you getting on all right sir
yes said magnus after a while yes all right
i am going away come to say goodbye
no he interrupted himself with a deprecatory smile said didnot you
well you are going away too your wife tells me
yes going away
i canot stay on he hesitated a long time groping for the right word canot stay the name of this place
los muertos put in presley
no it isnot
yes it is too thats right los muertos
i donot know where my memory has gone to of late
well i hope you will be better soon governor
as presley spoke the words behrman entered the room and the governor sprang up with unexpected agility and stood against the wall drawing one long breath after another watching the railroad agent with intent eyes
behrman saluted both men affably and sat down near the desk drawing the links of his heavy watch chain through his fat fingers
there wasnot anybody outside when i knocked but i heard your voice in here governor so i came right in
i wanted to ask you governor if my carpenters can begin work in here day after tomorrow
i want to take down that partition there and throw this room and the next into one
i guess that will be wonot it be out of here by then wonot you
there was no vagueness about speech or manner now
there was that same alertness in his demeanour that one sees in a tamed lion in the presence of its trainer
yes yes he said quickly you can send your men here
i will be gone by tomorrow donot want to seem to hurry you governor
no you will not hurry me
i am ready to go now
anything i can do for you governor
nothing
yes there is governor insisted behrman think now that all is over we ought to be good friends
i think i can do something for you
we still want an assistant in the local freight managers office
now what do you say to having a try at it a salary of fifty a month goes with it
i guess you must be in need of money now and theres always the wife to support what do you say
will you try the place
presley could only stare at the man in speechless wonder
what was he driving at
what reason was there back of this new move and why should it be made thus openly and in his hearing
an explanation occurred to him
was this merely a pleasantry on the part of behrman a way of enjoying to the full his triumph was he testing the completeness of his victory trying to see just how far he could go how far beneath his feet he could push his oldtime enemy
what do you say he repeated
will you try the place inquired the governor
oh not insisting on anything cried behrman offering you a place thats all
will you take it
yes yes take it come over to our side
yes come over have to turn railroad understand turn railroad
guess there may be times when youll have to take orders from me take orders from you have to be loyal to railroad you know
no funny business be loyal to the railroad
you would like the place then
yes
behrman turned from magnus who at once resumed his seat and began again to sort his papers
well presley said the railroad agent guess i wonot see you again hope not answered the other
tut tut presley you know you canot make me angry
he put on his hat of varnished straw and wiped his fat forehead with his handkerchief
of late he had grown fatter than ever and the linen vest stamped with a multitude of interlocked horseshoes strained tight its imitation pearl buttons across the great protuberant stomach
presley looked at the man a moment before replying
but a few weeks ago he could not thus have faced the great enemy of the farmers without a gust of blind rage blowing tempestuous through all his bones
now however he found to his surprise that his fury had lapsed to a profound contempt in which there was bitterness but no truculence
he was tired tired to death of the whole business
yes he answered deliberately am going away
you have ruined this place for me
i couldnot live here where i should have to see you or the results of what you have done whenever i stirred out of doors
nonsense presley answered the other refusing to become angry foolishness that kind of talk though of course i understand how you feel
i guess it was you wasnot it who threw that bomb into my house
it was
well that donot show any common sense presley returned behrman with perfect aplomb
what could you have gained by killing me
not so much probably as you have gained by killing harran and annixter
but thats all passed now safe from me
the strangeness of this talk the oddity of the situation burst upon him and he laughed aloud
it donot seem as though you could be brought to book behrman by anybody or by any means does it
they canot get at you through the law canot get you pistol missed fire for just your benefit and you even escaped six inches of plugged gas pipe
just what are we going to do with you
best give it up pres my boy returned the other guess there ainot anything can touch me
well magnus he said turning once more to the governor
well think over what you say and let you know if i can get the place for you in a day or two
you see he added getting pretty old magnus derrick
presley flung himself from the room unable any longer to witness the depths into which magnus had fallen
what other scenes of degradation were enacted in that room how much further behrman carried the humiliation he did not know
he suddenly felt that the air of the office was choking him
he hurried up to what once had been his own room
on his way he could not but note that much of the house was in disarray a great packingup was in progress trunks halffull stood in the hallways crates and cases in a litter of straw encumbered the rooms
the servants came and went with armfuls of books ornaments articles of clothing
presley took from his room only a few manuscripts and notebooks and a small valise full of his personal effects at the doorway he paused and holding the knob of the door in his hand looked back into the room a very long time
he descended to the lower floor and entered the diningroom
mrs derrick had disappeared
presley stood for a long moment in front of the fireplace looking about the room remembering the scenes that he had witnessed conference when osterman had first suggested the fight for railroad commissioner and then later the attack on lyman derrick and the sudden revelation of that inconceivable treachery
but as he stood considering these things a door to his right opened and hilma entered the room
presley came forward holding out his hand all unable to believe his eyes
it was a woman grave dignified composed who advanced to meet him
hilma was dressed in black the cut and fashion of the gown severe almost monastic
all the little feminine and contradictory daintinesses were nowhere to be seen
her statuesque calm evenness of contour yet remained but it was the calmness of great sorrow of infinite resignation
beautiful she still remained but she was older
the seriousness of one who has gained the knowledge of the of its to envelope her
the calm gravity of a great suffering past but not forgotten sat upon her
not yet twentyone she exhibited the demeanour of a woman of forty
the onetime amplitude of her figure the fulness of hip and shoulder the great deep swell from waist to throat were gone
she had grown thinner and in consequence seemed unusually almost unnaturally tall
her neck was slender the outline of her full lips and round chin was a little sharp her arms those wonderful beautiful arms of hers were a little shrunken
but her eyes were as wide open as always rimmed as ever by the thin intensely black line of the lashes and her brown fragrant hair was still thick still at times glittered and coruscated in the sun
when she spoke it was with the oldtime velvety huskiness of voice that annixter had learned to love so well
oh it is you she said giving him her hand
you were good to want to see me before you left
i hear that you are going away
she sat down upon the sofa
yes presley answered drawing a chair near to her yes i felt i could not here any longer
i am going to take a long ocean voyage
my ship sails in a few days
but you mrs annixter what are you going to do
is there any way i can serve you
no she answered nothing
papa is doing well
we are living here now
you are well
she made a little helpless gesture with both her hands smiling very sadly
as you see she answered
as he talked presley was looking at her intently
her dignity was a new element in her character and the certain slender effect of her figure emphasised now by the long folds of the black gown she wore carried it almost superbly
she conveyed something of the impression of a queen in exile
but she had lost none of her womanliness rather the contrary
adversity had softened her as well as deepened her
presley saw that very clearly
hilma had arrived now at her perfect maturity she had known great love and she had known great grief and the woman that had awakened in her with her affection for annixter had been strengthened and infinitely ennobled by his death
what if things had been different
thus as he conversed with her presley found himself wondering
her sweetness her beautiful gentleness and tenderness were almost like palpable presences
it was almost as if a caress had been laid softly upon his cheek as if a gentle hand closed upon his
here he knew was sympathy here he knew was an infinite capacity for love
then suddenly all the tired heart of him went out towards her
a longing to give the best that was in him to the memory of her to be strong and noble because of her to reshape his purposeless halfwasted life with her nobility and purity and gentleness for his inspiration leaped all at once within him leaped and stood firm hardening to a resolve stronger than any he had ever known
for an instant he told himself that the suddenness of this new emotion must be evidence of its insincerity
he was perfectly well aware that his impulses were abrupt and of short duration
but he knew that this was not sudden
without realising it he had been from the first drawn to hilma and all through these last terrible days since the time he had seen her at los muertos just after the battle at the ditch she had obtruded continually upon his thoughts
the sight of her today more beautiful than ever quiet strong reserved had only brought matters to a culmination
are you he asked her are you so unhappy hilma that you can look forward to no more brightness in your life
unless i could my husband she answered how can i be happy
i would rather be unhappy in remembering him than happy in forgetting him
he was my whole world literally and truly
nothing seemed to count before i knew him and nothing can count for me now after i have lost him
you think now he answered that in being happy again you would be disloyal to him
but you will find after a from it need not be so
the part of you that belonged to your husband can always keep him sacred that part of you belongs to him and he to it
but you are young you have all your life to live yet
your sorrow need not be a burden to you
if you consider it as you you some day believe will only be a great help to you
it will make you more noble a truer woman more generous think i see she answered and i never thought about it in that light before want to help you he answered as you have helped me
i want to be your friend and above all things i do not want to see your life wasted
i am going away and it is quite possible i shall never see you again but you will always be a help to me do not understand she answered but i know you mean to be very very kind to me
yes i hope when you come you ever will still be that
i do not know why you should want to be so kind unlessyes of were my husbands dearest friend
they talked a little longer and at length presley rose cannot bring myself to see mrs derrick again he said
it would only serve to make her very unhappy
will you explain that to her
i think she will understand
yes answered hilma
yes i will
there was a pause
there seemed to be nothing more for either of them to say
presley held out his hand she said as she gave him hers
he carried it to his lips he answered and may god bless you
he turned away abruptly and left the room
but as he was quietly making his way out of the house hoping to get to his horse unobserved he came suddenly upon mrs dyke and sidney on the porch of the house
he had forgotten that since the affair at the ditch los muertos had been a home to the engineers mother and daughter
and you mrs dyke he asked as he took her hand in this breakup of everything where do you go
to the city she answered to san francisco
i have a sister there who will look after the little tad
but you how about yourself mrs dyke
she answered him in a quiet voice monotonous expressionless am going to die very soon mr presley
there is no reason why i should live any longer
my son is in prison for life everything is over for me and i am tired worn out
you mustnot talk like that mrs dyke protested presley nonsense you will live long enough to see the little tad married
he tried to be cheerful
but he knew his words lacked the ring of conviction
death already overshadowed the face of the engineers mother
he felt that she spoke the truth and as he stood there speaking to her for the last time his arm about little shoulder he knew that he was seeing the beginnings of the wreck of another family and that like hilda hooven another baby girl was to be started in life through no fault of hers fearfully handicapped weighed down at the threshold of existence with a load of disgrace
hilda hooven and sidney dyke what was to be their histories the one sister of an outcast the other daughter of a convict
and he thought of that other young girl the little honora gerard the heiress of millions petted loved receiving adulation from all who came near to her whose only care was to choose from among the multitude of pleasures that the world hastened to present to her consideration he said holding out his hand
sidney
he kissed the little girl clasped mrs hand a moment with his then slinging his satchel about his shoulders by the long strap with which it was provided left the house and mounting his horse rode away from los muertos never to return
presley came out upon the county road
at a little distance to his left he could see the group of buildings where once broderson had lived
these were being remodelled at length to suit the larger demands of the new agriculture
a strange man came out by the road gate no doubt the new proprietor
presley turned away hurrying northwards along the county road by the mammoth wateringtank and the long windbreak of poplars
he came to place
there was no change here
the saloon had weathered the storm indispensable to the new as well as to the old regime
the same dusty buggies and buckboards were tied under the shed and as presley hurried by he could distinguish voice loud as ever still proclaiming his creed of annihilation
bonneville presley avoided
he had no associations with the town
he turned aside from the road and crossing the northwest corner of los muertos and the line of the railroad turned back along the upper road till he came to the long trestle and desolation abandonment
a vast stillness profound unbroken brooded low over all the place
no living thing stirred
the rusted windmill on the skeletonlike tower of the artesian well was motionless the great barn empty the windows of the ranch house cook house and dairy boarded up
nailed upon a tree near the broken gateway was a board white painted with stencilled letters bearing the inscription warning
by order and as he had planned presley reached the hills by the head waters of creek late in the afternoon
toilfully he climbed them reached the highest crest and turning about looked long and for the last time at all the reach of the valley unrolled beneath him
the land of the ranches opened out forever and forever under the stimulus of that measureless range of vision
the whole gigantic sweep of the san joaquin expanded titanic before the eye of the mind flagellated with heat quivering and shimmering under the suns red eye
it was the season after the harvest and the great earth the mother after its period of reproduction its pains of labour delivered of the fruit of its loins slept the sleep of exhaustion in the infinite repose of the colossus benignant eternal strong the nourisher of nations the feeder of an entire world
and as presley looked there came to him strong and true the sense and the significance of all the enigma of growth
he seemed for one instant to touch the explanation of existence
men were nothings mere animalculae mere ephemerides that fluttered and fell and were forgotten between dawn and dusk
vanamee had said there was no death
but for one second presley could go one step further
men were naught death was naught life was naught only that brought men into the world that crowded them out of it to make way for the succeeding generation that made the wheat grow that garnered it from the soil to give place to the succeeding crop
it was the mystery of creation the stupendous miracle of recreation the vast rhythm of the seasons measured alternative the sun and the stars keeping time as the eternal symphony of reproduction swung in its tremendous cadences like the colossal pendulum of an almighty energy flung out from the hand of the lord god himself immortal calm infinitely strong
but as he stood thus looking down upon the great valley he was aware of the figure of a man far in the distance moving steadily towards the mission of san juan
the man was hardly more than a dot but there was something unmistakably familiar in his gait and besides this presley could fancy that he was hatless
he touched his pony with his spur
the man was vanamee beyond all doubt and a little later presley descending the maze of cowpaths and cattletrails that led down towards the broderson creek overtook his friend
instantly presley was aware of an immense change face was still that of an ascetic still glowed with the rarefied intelligence of a young seer a halfinspired shepherdprophet of hebraic legends but the shadow of that great sadness which for so long had brooded over him was gone the grief that once he had fancied deathless was indeed dead or rather swallowed up in a victorious joy that radiated like sunlight at dawn from the deepset eyes and the hollow swarthy cheeks
they talked together till nearly sundown but to questions as to the reasons for happiness the other would say nothing
once only he allowed himself to touch upon the subject
death and grief are little things he said
they are transient
life must be before death and joy before grief
else there are no such things as death or grief
these are only negatives
life is positive
death is only the absence of life just as night is only the absence of day and if this is so there is no such thing as death
there is only life and the suppression of life that we foolishly say is death
suppression i say not extinction
i do not say that life returns
life never departs
life simply for certain seasons it is hidden in the dark but is that death extinction annihilation
i take it thank god that it is not
does the grain of wheat hidden for certain seasons in the dark die
the grain we think is dead but how
not as one grain but as twenty
so all life
death is only real for all the detritus of the world for all the sorrow for all the injustice for all the grief
presley the good never dies evil dies cruelty oppression selfishness die but nobility but love but sacrifice but generosity but truth thank god for it small as they are difficult as it is to discover live forever these are eternal
you are all broken all cast down by what you have seen in this valley this hopeless struggle this apparently hopeless despair
well the end is not yet
what is it that remains after all is over after the dead are buried and the hearts are broken
look at it all from the vast height of greatest good to the greatest numbers
what remains
men perish men are corrupted hearts are rent asunder but what remains untouched unassailable undefiled
try to find that not only in this but in every crisis of the worlds life and you will find if your view be large enough that it is not evil but good that in the end remains
there was a long pause
presley his mind full of new thoughts held his peace and vanamee added at length believed angele dead
i wept over her grave mourned for her as dead in corruption
she has come back to me more beautiful than ever
do not ask me any further
to put this story this idyl into words would for me be a profanation
this must suffice you
angele has returned to me and i am happy
adios
he rose suddenly
the friends clasped each others hands
we shall probably never meet again said vanamee but if these are the last words i ever speak to you listen to them and remember them because i know i speak the truth
evil is shortlived
never judge of the whole round of life by the mere segment you can see
the whole is in the end perfect
abruptly he took himself away
he was gone
presley alone thoughtful his hands clasped behind him passed on through the teeming with ripened face set from them forever
not so vanamee
for hours he roamed the countryside now through the deserted cluster of buildings that had once been home now through the rustling and as yet uncut wheat of quien sabe now treading the slopes of the hills far to the north and again following the winding courses of the streams
thus he spent the night
at length the day broke resplendent cloudless
the night was passed
there was all the sparkle and effervescence of joy in the crystal sunlight as the dawn expanded roseate and at length flamed dazzling to the zenith when the sun moved over the edge of the world and looked down upon all the earth like the eye of god the father
at the moment vanamee stood breastdeep in the wheat in a solitary corner of the quien sabe rancho
he turned eastward facing the celestial glory of the day and sent his voiceless call far from him across the golden grain out towards the little valley of flowers
swiftly the answer came
it advanced to meet him
the flowers of the seed ranch were gone dried and parched by the summers sun shedding their seed by handfuls to be sown again and blossom yet another time
the seed ranch was no longer royal with colour
the roses the lilies the carnations the hyacinths the poppies the violets the mignonette all these had vanished the little valley was without colour where once it had exhaled the most delicious perfume it was now odourless
under the blinding light of the day it stretched to its hillsides bare brown unlovely
the romance of the place had vanished but with it had vanished the vision
it was no longer a figment of his imagination a creature of dreams that advanced to meet vanamee
it was was angele in the flesh vital sane material who at last issued forth from the entrance of the little valley
romance had vanished but better than romance was here
not a manifestation not a dream but her very self
the night was gone but the sun had risen the flowers had disappeared but strong vigorous noble the wheat had come
in the wheat he waited for her
he saw her coming
she was simply dressed
no fanciful wreath of tuberoses was about her head now no strange garment of red and gold enveloped her now
it was no longer an ephemeral illusion of the night evanescent mystic but a simple country girl coming to meet her lover
the vision of the night had been beautiful but what was it compared to this
reality was better than romance
the simple honesty of a loving trusting heart was better than a legend of flowers an hallucination of the moonlight
she came nearer
bathed in sunlight he saw her face to face saw her hair hanging in two straight plaits on either side of her face saw the enchanting fulness of her lips the strange balancing movement of her head upon her slender neck
but now she was no longer asleep
the wonderful eyes violet blue heavylidded with their perplexing oriental slant towards the temples were wide open and fixed upon his
from out the world of romance out of the moonlight and the star sheen out of the faint radiance of the lilies and the still air heavy with perfume she had at last come to him
the moonlight the flowers and the dream were all vanished away
angele was realised in the wheat
she stood forth in the sunlight a fact and no longer a fancy
he ran forward to meet her and she held out her arms to him
he caught her to him and she turning her face to his kissed him on the mouth love you i love you she murmured
upon descending from his train at port costa behrman asked to be directed at once to where the bark swanhilda was taking on grain
though he had bought and greatly enlarged his new elevator at this port he had never seen it
the work had been carried on through agents behrman having far too many and more pressing occupations to demand his presence and attention
now however he was to see the concrete evidence of his success for the first time
he picked his way across the railroad tracks to the line of warehouses that bordered the docks numbered with enormous roman numerals and full of grain in bags
the sight of these bags of grain put him in mind of the fact that among all the other shippers he was practically alone in his way of handling his wheat
they handled the grain in bags he however preferred it in the bulk
bags were sometimes four cents apiece and he had decided to build his elevator and bulk his grain therein rather than to incur this expense
only a small part of his on number three been sacked
all the rest practically twothirds of the entire harvest of los muertos now found itself warehoused in his enormous elevator at port costa
to a certain degree it had been the desire of observing the working of his system of handling the wheat in bulk that had drawn behrman to port costa
but the more powerful motive had been curiosity not to say downright sentiment
so long had he planned for this day of triumph so eagerly had he looked forward to it that now when it had come he wished to enjoy it to its fullest extent wished to miss no feature of the disposal of the crop
he had watched it harvested he had watched it hauled to the railway and now would watch it as it poured into the hold of the ship would even watch the ship as she cleared and got under way
he passed through the warehouses and came out upon the dock that ran parallel with the shore of the bay
a great quantity of shipping was in view barques for the most part cape horners great deep sea tramps whose ironshod forefeet had parted every ocean the world round from rangoon to rio janeiro and from melbourne to christiania
some were still in the stream loaded with wheat to the plimsoll mark ready to depart with the next tide
but many others laid their great flanks alongside the docks and at that moment were being filled by derrick and crane with thousands upon thousands of bags of wheat
the scene was brisk the cranes creaked and swung incessantly with a rattle of chains stevedores and wharfingers toiled and perspired boatswains and dockmasters shouted orders drays rumbled the water lapped at the piles a group of sailors painting the flanks of one of the great ships raised an occasional chanty the trade wind sang aeolian in the cordages filling the air with the nimble taint of salt
all around were the noises of ships and the feel and flavor of the sea
behrman soon discovered his elevator
it was the largest structure discernible and upon its red roof in enormous white letters was his own name
thither between piles of grain bags halted drays crates and boxes of merchandise with an occasional pyramid of salmon cases behrman took his way
cabled to the dock close under his elevator lay a great ship with lofty masts and great spars
her stern was toward him as he approached and upon it in raised golden letters he could read the words swanhildaliverpool
he went aboard by a very steep gangway and found the mate on the quarter deck
behrman introduced himself
well he added how are you getting on
very fairly sir returned the mate who was an englishman have her all snugged down tight by this time day after tomorrow a great saving of time shunting the stuff in her like that and three men can do the work of seven have a look round i believe returned behrman answered the mate with a nod
behrman went forward to the hatch that opened down into the vast hold of the ship
a great iron chute connected this hatch with the elevator and through it was rushing a veritable cataract of wheat
it came from some gigantic bin within the elevator itself rushing down the confines of the chute to plunge into the roomy gloomy interior of the hold with an incessant metallic roar persistent steady inevitable
no men were in sight
the place was deserted
no human agency seemed to be back of the movement of the wheat
rather the grain seemed impelled with a force of its own a resistless huge force eager vivid impatient for the sea
behrman stood watching his ears deafened with the roar of the hard grains against the metallic lining of the chute
he put his hand once into the rushing tide and the contact rasped the flesh of his fingers and like an undertow drew his hand after it in its impetuous dash
cautiously he peered down into the hold
a musty odour rose to his nostrils the vigorous pungent aroma of the raw cereal
it was dark
he could see nothing but all about and over the opening of the hatch the air was full of a fine impalpable dust that blinded the eyes and choked the throat and nostrils
as his eyes became used to the shadows of the cavern below him he began to distinguish the grey mass of the wheat a great expanse almost liquid in its texture which as the cataract from above plunged into it moved and shifted in long slow eddies
as he stood there this cataract on a sudden increased in volume
he turned about casting his eyes upward toward the elevator to discover the cause
his foot caught in a coil of rope and he fell headforemost into the hold
the fall was a long one and he struck the surface of the wheat with the sodden impact of a bundle of damp clothes
for the moment he was stunned
all the breath was driven from his body
he could neither move nor cry out
but by degrees his wits steadied themselves and his breath returned to him
he looked about and above him
the daylight in the hold was dimmed and clouded by the thick chaffdust thrown off by the pour of grain and even this dimness dwindled to twilight at a short distance from the opening of the hatch while the remotest quarters were lost in impenetrable blackness
he got upon his feet only to find that he sunk ankle deep in the loose packed mass underfoot
hell he muttered a fix
directly underneath the chute the wheat as it poured in raised itself in a conical mound but from the sides of this mound it shunted away incessantly in thick layers flowing in all directions with the nimbleness of water
even as behrman spoke a wave of grain poured around his legs and rose rapidly to the level of his knees
he stepped quickly back
to stay near the chute would soon bury him to the waist
no doubt there was some other exit from the hold some companion ladder that led up to the deck
he scuffled and waded across the wheat groping in the dark with outstretched hands
with every inhalation he choked filling his mouth and nostrils more with dust than with air
at times he could not breathe at all but gagged and gasped his lips distended
but search as he would he could find no outlet to the hold no stairway no companion ladder
again and again staggering along in the black darkness he bruised his knuckles and forehead against the iron sides of the ship
he gave up the attempt to find any interior means of escape and returned laboriously to the space under the open hatchway
already he could see that the level of the wheat was raised
god he said this isnot going to do at all
he uttered a great shout
hello on deck there somebody
for sake
the steady metallic roar of the pouring wheat drowned out his voice
he could scarcely hear it himself above the rush of the cataract
besides this he found it impossible to stay under the hatch
the flying grains of wheat spattering as they fell stung his face like winddriven particles of ice
it was a veritable torture his hands smarted with it
once he was all but blinded
furthermore the succeeding waves of wheat rolling from the mound under the chute beat him back swirling and dashing against his legs and knees mounting swiftly higher carrying him off his feet
once more he retreated drawing back from beneath the hatch
he stood still for a moment and shouted again
it was in vain
his voice returned upon him unable to penetrate the thunder of the chute and horrified he discovered that so soon as he stood motionless upon the wheat he sank into it
before he knew it he was kneedeep again and a long swirl of grain sweeping outward from the everbreaking everreforming pyramid below the chute poured around his thighs immobolising him
a frenzy of terror suddenly leaped to life within him
the horror of death the fear of the trap shook him like a dry reed
shouting he tore himself free of the wheat and once more scrambled and struggled towards the hatchway
he stumbled as he reached it and fell directly beneath the pour
like a storm of small shot mercilessly pitilessly the unnumbered multitude of hurtling grains flagellated and beat and tore his flesh
blood streamed from his forehead and thickening with the powderlike chaffdust blinded his eyes
he struggled to his feet once more
an avalanche from the cone of wheat buried him to his thighs
he was forced back and back and back beating the air falling rising howling for aid
he could no longer see his eyes crammed with dust smarted as if transfixed with needles whenever he opened them
his mouth was full of the dust his lips were dry with it thirst tortured him while his outcries choked and gagged in his rasped throat
and all the while without stop incessantly inexorably the wheat as if moving with a force all its own shot downward in a prolonged roar persistent steady inevitable
he retreated to a far corner of the hold and sat down with his back against the iron hull of the ship and tried to collect his thoughts to calm himself
surely there must be some way of escape surely he was not to die like this die in this dreadful substance that was neither solid nor fluid
what was he to do
how make himself heard
but even as he thought about this the cone under the chute broke again and sent a great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward him
it reached him where he sat and buried his hand and one foot
he sprang up trembling and made for another corner
by god he cried by god i must think of something pretty quick
once more the level of the wheat rose and the grains began piling deeper about him
once more he retreated
once more he crawled staggering to the foot of the cataract screaming till his ears sang and his eyeballs strained in their sockets and once more the relentless tide drove him back
then began that terrible dance of death the man dodging doubling squirming hunted from one corner to another the wheat slowly inexorably flowing rising spreading to every angle to every nook and cranny
it reached his middle
furious and with bleeding hands and broken nails he dug his way out to fall backward all but exhausted gasping for breath in the dustthickened air
roused again by the slow advance of the tide he leaped up and stumbled away blinded with the agony in his eyes only to crash against the metal hull of the vessel
he turned about the blood streaming from his face and paused to collect his senses and with a rush another wave swirled about his ankles and knees
exhaustion grew upon him
to stand still meant to sink to lie or sit meant to be buried the quicker and all this in the dark all this in an air that could scarcely be breathed all this while he fought an enemy that could not be gripped toiling in a sea that could not be stayed
guided by the sound of the falling wheat behrman crawled on hands and knees toward the hatchway
once more he raised his voice in a shout for help
his bleeding throat and raw parched lips refused to utter but a wheezing moan
once more he tried to look toward the one patch of faint light above him
his eyelids clogged with chaff could no longer open
the wheat poured about his waist as he raised himself upon his knees
reason fled
deafened with the roar of the grain blinded and made dumb with its chaff he threw himself forward with clutching fingers rolling upon his back and lay there moving feebly the head rolling from side to side
the wheat leaping continuously from the chute poured around him
it filled the pockets of the coat it crept up the sleeves and trouser legs it covered the great protuberant stomach it ran at last in rivulets into the distended gasping mouth
it covered the face
upon the surface of the wheat under the chute nothing moved but the wheat itself
there was no sign of life
then for an instant the surface stirred
a hand fat with short fingers and swollen veins reached up clutching then fell limp and prone
in another instant it was covered
in the hold of the swanhilda there was no movement but the widening ripples that spread flowing from the everbreaking everreforming cone no sound but the rushing of the wheat that continued to plunge incessantly from the iron chute in a prolonged roar persistent steady inevitable
the swanhilda cast off from the docks at port costa two days after presley had left bonneville and the ranches and made her way up to san francisco anchoring in the stream off the city front
a few hours after her arrival presley waiting at his club received a despatch from cedarquist to the effect that she would clear early the next morning and that he must be aboard of her before midnight
he sent his trunks aboard and at once hurried to office to say goodbye
he found the manufacturer in excellent spirits
what do you think of lyman derrick now presley he said when presley had sat down in the new politics with a vengeance isnot he
and our own dear railroad openly acknowledges him as their candidate heard of his canvass
yes yes answered presley
well he knows his business best
but cedarquist was full of another idea his new organizing of a line of clipper wheat ships for pacific and oriental prospering
the swanhilda is the mother of the fleet pres
i had to buy but the keel of her sister ship will be laid by the time she discharges at calcutta carry our wheat into asia yet
the anglosaxon started from there at the beginning of everything and its manifest destiny that he must circle the globe and fetch up where he began his march
you are up with procession pres going to india this way in a wheat ship that flies american colours
by the way do you know where the money is to come from to build the sister ship of the swanhilda
from the sale of the plant and scrap iron of the atlas works
yes given it up definitely that business
the people here would not back me up
but working off on this new line now
it may break me but well try it on
you know the million dollar fair was formally opened yesterday
there is he added with a wink a midway pleasance in connection with the thing
mrs cedarquist and our friend hartrath got up a subscription to construct a figure of of dried apricots
i assure you he remarked with prodigious gravity it is a real work of art and quite a feature of the fair
well good luck to you pres
write to me from honolulu and bon voyage
my respects to the hungry hindoo
tell him coming father abraham a hundred thousand more
tell the men of the east to look out for the men of the west
the irrepressible yank is knocking at the doors of their temples and he will want to sell em carpetsweepers for their harems and electric light plants for their temple shrines to you sir
get fat yourself while youre about it presley he observed as the two stood up and shook hands
there shouldnot be any lack of food on a wheat ship
bread enough surely
little monotonous though
man cannot live by bread alone
well youre really off sir
and as presley issued from the building and stepped out into the street he was abruptly aware of a great wagon shrouded in white cloth inside of which a bass drum was being furiously beaten
on the cloth in great letters were the words vote for lyman derrick regular republican nominee for governor of california
the swanhilda lifted and rolled slowly majestically on the ground swell of the pacific the water hissing and boiling under her forefoot her cordage vibrating and droning in the steady rush of the trade winds
it was drawing towards evening and her lights had just been set
the master passed presley who was leaning over the rail smoking a cigarette and paused long enough to remark the land yonder if you can make it out is point gordo and if you were to draw a line from our position now through that point and carry it on about a hundred miles further it would just about cross tulare county not very far from where you used to live see answered presley see
thanks
i am glad to know that
the master passed on and presley going up to the quarter deck looked long and earnestly at the faint line of mountains that showed vague and bluish above the waste of tumbling water
those were the mountains of the coast range and beyond them was what once had been his home
bonneville was there and guadalajara and los muertos and quien sabe the mission of san juan the seed ranch desolated home and ruined hopfields
well it was all over now that terrible drama through which he had lived
already it was far distant from him but once again it rose in his memory portentous sombre ineffaceable
he passed it all in review from the day of his first meeting with vanamee to the day of his parting with hilma
he saw it great sweep of country opening to view from the summit of the hills at the head waters of creek the barn dance at the harness room with its jam of furious men the quiet garden of the mission house his flight upon the engine his brave fight in the chaparral lyman derrick at bay in the diningroom of the ranch house the rabbit drive the fight at the irrigating ditch the shouting mob in the bonneville opera house
the drama was over
the fight of ranch and railroad had been wrought out to its dreadful close
it was true as shelgrim had said that forces rather than men had locked horns in that struggle but for all that the men of the ranch and not the men of the railroad had suffered
into the prosperous valley into the quiet community of farmers that galloping monster that terror of steel and steam had burst shooting athwart the horizons flinging the echo of its thunder over all the ranches of the valley leaving blood and destruction in its path
yes the railroad had prevailed
the ranches had been seized in the tentacles of the octopus the iniquitous burden of extortionate freight rates had been imposed like a yoke of iron
the monster had killed harran had killed osterman had killed broderson had killed hooven
it had beggared magnus and had driven him to a state of semiinsanity after he had wrecked his honour in the vain attempt to do evil that good might come
it had enticed lyman into its toils to pluck from him his manhood and his honesty corrupting him and poisoning him beyond redemption it had hounded dyke from his legitimate employment and had made of him a highwayman and criminal
it had cast forth mrs hooven to starve to death upon the city streets
it had driven minna to prostitution
it had slain annixter at the very moment when painfully and manfully he had at last achieved his own salvation and stood forth resolved to do right to act unselfishly and to live for others
it had widowed hilma in the very dawn of her happiness
it had killed the very babe within the mothers womb strangling life ere yet it had been born stamping out the spark ordained by god to burn through all eternity
what then was left
was there no hope no outlook for the future no rift in the black curtain no glimmer through the night
was good to be thus overthrown
was evil thus to be strong and to prevail
was nothing left
then suddenly words came back to his mind
what was the larger view what contributed the greatest good to the greatest numbers
what was the full round of the circle whose segment only he beheld
in the end the ultimate final end of all what was left
yes good issued from this crisis untouched unassailable undefiled in the sunshineperished were shot down in the very noon of life hearts were broken little children started in life lamentably handicapped young girls were brought to a life of shame old women died in the heart of life for lack of food
in that little isolated group of human insects misery death and anguish spun like a wheel of fire
untouched unassailable undefiled that mighty worldforce that nourisher of nations wrapped in nirvanic calm indifferent to the human swarm gigantic resistless moved onward in its appointed grooves
through the welter of blood at the irrigation ditch through the sham charity and shallow philanthropy of famine relief committees the great harvest of los muertos rolled like a flood from the sierras to the himalayas to feed thousands of starving scarecrows on the barren plains of india
falseness dies injustice and oppression in the end of everything fade and vanish away
greed cruelty selfishness and inhumanity are shortlived the individual suffers but the race goes on
annixter dies but in a far distant corner of the world a thousand lives are saved
the larger view always and through all shams all wickednesses discovers the truth that will in the end prevail and all things surely inevitably resistlessly work together for good
