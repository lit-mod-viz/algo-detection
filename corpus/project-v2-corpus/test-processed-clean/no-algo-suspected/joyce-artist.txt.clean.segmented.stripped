portrait of the artist as a young man joyce chapter i once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo
his father told him that story his father looked at him through a glass he had a hairy face
he was baby tuckoo
the moocow came down the road where betty byrne lived she sold lemon platt the wild rose blossoms on the little green place
he sang that song
that was his song the green wothe botheth
when you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold
his mother put on the oilsheet
that had the queer smell
his mother had a nicer smell than his father
she played on the piano the sailors hornpipe for him to dance
he danced tralala lala tralala tralaladdy tralala lala tralala lala
uncle charles and dante clapped
they were older than his father and mother but uncle charles was older than dante
dante had two brushes in her press
the brush with the maroon velvet back was for michael davitt and the brush with the green velvet back was for parnell
dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper
the vances lived in number seven
they had a different father and mother
they were father and mother
when they were grown up he was going to marry eileen
he hid under the table
his mother said stephen will apologise
dante said if not the eagles will come and pull out his eyes pull out his eyes apologise apologise pull out his eyes
apologise pull out his eyes pull out his eyes apologise
the wide playgrounds were swarming with boys
all were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries
the evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light
he kept on the fringe of his line out of sight of his prefect out of the reach of the rude feet feigning to run now and then
he felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery
rody kickham was not like that he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said
rody kickham was a decent fellow but nasty roche was a stink
rody kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory
nasty roche had big hands
he called the friday pudding dogintheblanket
and one day he had asked what is your name
stephen had answered stephen dedalus
then nasty roche had said what kind of a name is that
and when stephen had not been able to answer nasty roche had asked what is your father
stephen had answered gentleman
then nasty roche had asked is he a magistrate
he crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line making little runs now and then
but his hands were bluish with cold
he kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit
that was a belt round his pocket
and belt was also to give a fellow a belt
one day a fellow said to cantwell give you such a belt in a second
cantwell had answered go and fight your match
give cecil thunder a belt like to see you give you a toe in the rump for yourself
that was not a nice expression
his mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in the college
nice mother
the first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him and her nose and eyes were red
but he had pretended not to see that she was going to cry
she was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried
and his father had given him two fiveshilling pieces for pocket money
and his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and whatever he did never to peach on a fellow
then at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother his soutane fluttering in the breeze and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it
they had cried to him from the car waving their hands goodbye stephen goodbye
goodbye stephen goodbye
he was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and fearful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots bent down to look through the legs
the fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping
then jack yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after
he ran after them a little way and then stopped
it was useless to run on
soon they would be going home for the holidays
after supper in the study hall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven to seventysix
it would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold
the sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle
he wondered from which window hamilton rowan had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows
one day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate
it was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle
it was like something in a book
perhaps leicester abbey was like that
and there were nice sentences in doctor spelling book
they were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from
wolsey died in leicester abbey where the abbots buried him
canker is a disease of plants cancer one of animals
it would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire leaning his head upon his hands and think on those sentences
he shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin
that was mean of wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuffbox for seasoned hacking chestnut the conqueror of forty
how cold and slimy the water had been
a fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum
mother was sitting at the fire with dante waiting for brigid to bring in the tea
she had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell
dante knew a lot of things
she had taught him where the mozambique channel was and what was the longest river in america and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon
father arnall knew more than dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle charles said that dante was a clever woman and a wellread woman
and when dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth that was heartburn
a voice cried far out on the playground all in
then other voices cried from the lower and third lines all in
all in
the players closed around flushed and muddy and he went among them glad to go in
rody kickham held the ball by its greasy lace
a fellow asked him to give it one last but he walked on without even answering the fellow
simon moonan told him not to because the prefect was looking
the fellow turned to simon moonan and said we all know why you speak
you are suck
suck was a queer word
the fellow called simon moonan that name because simon moonan used to tie the prefects false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry
but the sound was ugly
once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the wicklow hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin
and when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that suck
only louder
to remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot
there were two cocks that you turned and water came out cold and hot
he felt cold and then a little hot and he could see the names printed on the cocks
that was a very queer thing
and the air in the corridor chilled him too
it was queer and wettish
but soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like a little song
always the same and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it
it was the hour for sums
father arnall wrote a hard sum on the board and then said now then who will win
go ahead york
go ahead lancaster
stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused
the little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter
he was no good at sums but he tried his best so that york might not lose
father face looked very black but he was not in a wax he was laughing
then jack lawton cracked his fingers and father arnall looked at his copybook and said right
bravo lancaster
the red rose wins
come on now york
forge ahead
jack lawton looked over from his side
the little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on
stephen felt his own face red too thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements jack lawton or he
some weeks jack lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first
his white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard father voice
then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool
he thought his face must be white because it felt so cool
he could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter
white roses and red roses those were beautiful colours to think of
and the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too pink and cream and lavender
lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of
perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place
but you could not have a green rose
but perhaps somewhere in the world you could
the bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory
he sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread
the tablecloth was damp and limp
but he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion girt with a white apron poured into his cup
he wondered whether the scullions apron was damp too or whether all white things were cold and damp
nasty roche and saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins
they said they could not drink the tea that it was hogwash
their fathers were magistrates the fellows said
all the boys seemed to him very strange
they had all fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices
he longed to be at home and lay his head on his mothers lap
but he could not and so he longed for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed
he drank another cup of hot tea and fleming said up
have you a pain or whats up with you donot know stephen said
sick in your breadbasket fleming said because your face looks white
it will go away yes stephen said
but he was not sick there
he thought that he was sick in his heart if you could be sick in that place
fleming was very decent to ask him
he wanted to cry
he leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears
then he heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps of his ears
it made a roar like a train at night
and when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a tunnel
that night at dalkey the train had roared like that and then when it went into the tunnel the roar stopped
he closed his eyes and the train went on roaring and then stopping roaring again stopping
it was nice to hear it roar and stop and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop
then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in the middle of the refectory paddy rath and jimmy magee and the spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little portuguese who wore the woolly cap
and then the lower line tables and the tables of the third line
and every single fellow had a different way of walking
he sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little song of the gas
the prefect was at the door with some boys and simon moonan was knotting his false sleeves
he was telling them something about tullabeg
then he went away from the door and wells came over to stephen and said tell us dedalus do you kiss your mother before you go to bed
stephen answered do
wells turned to the other fellows and said i say heres a fellow says he kisses his mother every night before he goes to bed
the other fellows stopped their game and turned round laughing
stephen blushed under their eyes and said do not
wells said i say heres a fellow says he doesnot kiss his mother before he goes to bed
they all laughed again
stephen tried to laugh with them
he felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment
what was the right answer to the question
he had given two and still wells laughed
but wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar
he tried to think of mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to face
he did not like face
it was wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuffbox for seasoned hacking chestnut the conqueror of forty
it was a mean thing to do all the fellows said it was
and how cold and slimy the water had been
and a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum
the cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body and when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes
he still tried to think what was the right answer
was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother
what did that mean to kiss
you put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down
that was to kiss
his mother put her lips on his cheek her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek and they made a tiny little noise kiss
why did people do that with their two faces
sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the number pasted up inside from seventyseven to seventysix
but the christmas vacation was very far away but one time it would come because the earth moved round always
there was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography a big ball in the middle of clouds
fleming had a box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds maroon
that was like the two brushes in press the brush with the green velvet back for parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for michael davitt
but he had not told fleming to colour them those colours
fleming had done it himself
he opened the geography to study the lesson but he could not learn the names of places in america
still they were all different places that had different names
they were all in different countries and the countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and the world was in the universe
he turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written there himself his name and where he was
stephen dedalus class of elements clongowes wood college sallins county kildare ireland europe the world the universe that was in his writing and fleming one night for a cod had written on the opposite page stephen dedalus is my name ireland is my nation
clongowes is my dwellingplace and heaven my expectation
he read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry
then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own name
that was he and he read down the page again
what was after the universe
nothing
but was there anything round the universe to show where it stopped before the nothing place began
it could not be a wall but there could be a thin thin line there all round everything
it was very big to think about everything and everywhere
only god could do that
he tried to think what a big thought that must be but he could only think of god
god was name just as his name was stephen
dieu was the french for god and that was name too and when anyone prayed to god and said dieu then god knew at once that it was a french person that was praying
but though there were different names for god in all the different languages in the world and god understood what all the people who prayed said in their different languages still god remained always the same god and real name was god
it made him very tired to think that way
it made him feel his head very big
he turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds
he wondered which was right to be for the green or for the maroon because dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that was for parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that parnell was a bad man
he wondered if they were arguing at home about that
that was called politics
there were two sides in it dante was on one side and his father and mr casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle charles were on no side
every day there was something in the paper about it
it pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended
he felt small and weak
when would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric
they had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry
that was very far away
first came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation
it was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears
term vacation tunnel out noise stop
how far away it was
it was better to go to bed to sleep
only prayers in the chapel and then bed
he shivered and yawned
it would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot
first they were so cold to get into
he shivered to think how cold they were first
but then they got hot and then he could sleep
it was lovely to be tired
he yawned again
night prayers and then bed he shivered and wanted to yawn
it would be lovely in a few minutes
he felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn
the bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel
the corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit soon all would be dark and sleeping
there was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night
the sea was cold day and night but it was colder at night
it was cold and dark under the seawall beside his fathers house
but the kettle would be on the hob to make punch
the prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the responses lord open our lips and our mouths shall announce thy praise
incline unto our aid god
lord make haste to help us
there was a cold night smell in the chapel
but it was a holy smell
it was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at sunday mass
that was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy
but they were very holy peasants
they breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed
they lived in clane a fellow said there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from sallins
it would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf in the dark lit by the fire in the warm dark breathing the smell of the peasants air and rain and turf and corduroy
but the road there between the trees was dark
you would be lost in the dark
it made him afraid to think of how it was
he heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayer
he prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees
visit we beseech thee lord this habitation and drive away from it all the snares of the enemy
may thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and may thy blessing be always upon us through christ our lord
amen
his fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory
he told his fingers to hurry up
he had to undress and then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died
he rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly fearing that the gas would go down
he felt his shoulders shaking as he murmured god bless my father and my mother and spare them to me
god bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me
god bless dante and uncle charles and spare them to me
he blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet curled himself together under the cold white sheets shaking and trembling
but he would not go to hell when he died and the shaking would stop
a voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight
he peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides
the light was lowered quietly
the prefects shoes went away
where
down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end
he saw the dark
was it true about the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as carriagelamps
they said it was the ghost of a murderer
a long shiver of fear flowed over his body
he saw the dark entrance hall of the castle
old servants in old dress were in the ironingroom above the staircase
it was long ago
the old servants were quiet
there was a fire there but the hall was still dark
a figure came up the staircase from the hall
he wore the white cloak of a marshal his face was pale and strange he held his hand pressed to his side
he looked out of strange eyes at the old servants
they looked at him and saw their masters face and cloak and knew that he had received his deathwound
but only the dark was where they looked only dark silent air
their master had received his deathwound on the battlefield of prague far away over the sea
he was standing on the field his hand was pressed to his side his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal how cold and strange it was to think of that
all the dark was cold and strange
there were pale strange faces there great eyes like carriagelamps
they were the ghosts of murderers the figures of marshals who had received their deathwound on battlefields far away over the sea
what did they wish to say that their faces were so strange
visit we beseech thee lord this habitation and drive away from it all
going home for the holidays
that would be lovely the fellows had told him
getting up on the cars in the early wintry morning outside the door of the castle
the cars were rolling on the gravel
cheers for the rector
hurray
hurray
hurray
the cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised
they drove merrily along the country roads
the drivers pointed with their whips to bodenstown
the fellows cheered
they passed the farmhouse of the jolly farmer
cheer after cheer after cheer
through clane they drove cheering and cheered
the peasant women stood at the halfdoors the men stood here and there
the lovely smell there was in the wintry air the smell of clane rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and corduroy
the train was full of fellows a long long chocolate train with cream facings
the guards went to and fro opening closing locking unlocking the doors
they were men in dark blue and silver they had silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music click click click click
and the train raced on over the flat lands and past the hill of allen
the telegraph poles were passing passing
the train went on and on
it knew
there were lanterns in the hall of his fathers house and ropes of green branches
there were holly and ivy round the pierglass and holly and ivy green and red twined round the chandeliers
there were red holly and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls
holly and ivy for him and for christmas
lovely
all the people
welcome home stephen
noises of welcome
his mother kissed him
was that right
his father was a marshal now higher than a magistrate
welcome home stephen
noises
there was a noise of curtainrings running back along the rods of water being splashed in the basins
there was a noise of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory a noise of clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the fellows to look sharp
a pale sunlight showed the yellow curtains drawn back the tossed beds
his bed was very hot and his face and body were very hot
he got up and sat on the side of his bed
he was weak
he tried to pull on his stocking
it had a horrid rough feel
the sunlight was queer and cold
fleming said are you not well
he did not know and fleming said get back into bed tell youre not well sick
who is
tell get back into bed
is he sick
a fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking clinging to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed
he crouched down between the sheets glad of their tepid glow
he heard the fellows talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass
it was a mean thing to do to shoulder him into the square ditch they were saying
then their voices ceased they had gone
a voice at his bed said dedalus donot spy on us sure you wonot face was there
he looked at it and saw that wells was afraid didnot mean to
sure you wonot
his father had told him whatever he did never to peach on a fellow
he shook his head and answered no and felt glad
wells said didnot mean to honour bright
it was only for cod sorry
the face and the voice went away
sorry because he was afraid
afraid that it was some disease
canker was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals or another different
that was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening light creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line a heavy bird flying low through the grey light
leicester abbey lit up
wolsey died there
the abbots buried him themselves
it was not face it was the prefects
he was not foxing
no no he was sick really
he was not foxing
and he felt the prefects hand on his forehead and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefects cold damp hand
that was the way a rat felt slimy and damp and cold
every rat had two eyes to look out of
sleek slimy coats little little feet tucked up to jump black slimy eyes to look out of
they could understand how to jump
but the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry
when they were dead they lay on their sides
their coats dried then
they were only dead things
the prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying that he was to get up that father minister had said he was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary
and while he was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said we must pack off to brother michael because we have the collywobbles
he was very decent to say that
that was all to make him laugh
but he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery and then the prefect had to laugh by himself
the prefect cried quick march
hayfoot
strawfoot
they went together down the staircase and along the corridor and past the bath
as he passed the door he remembered with a vague fear the warm turfcoloured bogwater the warm moist air the noise of plunges the smell of the towels like medicine
brother michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine
that came from the bottles on the shelves
the prefect spoke to brother michael and brother michael answered and called the prefect sir
he had reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look
it was queer that he would always be a brother
it was queer too that you could not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look
was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others
there were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow and when they went in he called out hello young dedalus up
the sky is up brother michael said
he was a fellow out of the third of grammar and while stephen was undressing he asked brother michael to bring him a round of buttered toast
ah do he said
butter you up said brother michael get your walking papers in the morning when the doctor comes
will the fellow said not well yet
brother michael repeated get your walking papers
i tell you
he bent down to rake the fire
he had a long back like the long back of a tramhorse
he shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar
then brother michael went away and after a while the fellow out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep
that was the infirmary
he was sick then
had they written home to tell his mother and father
but it would be quicker for one of the priests to go himself to tell them
or he would write a letter for the priest to bring
dear mother i am sick
i want to go home
please come and take me home
i am in the infirmary
your fond son stephen how far away they were
there was cold sunlight outside the window
he wondered if he would die
you could die just the same on a sunny day
he might die before his mother came
then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when little had died
all the fellows would be at the mass dressed in black all with sad faces
wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him
the rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque
and they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes
and wells would be sorry then for what he had done
and the bell would toll slowly
he could hear the tolling
he said over to himself the song that brigid had taught him
dingdong
the castle bell
farewell my mother
bury me in the old churchyard beside my eldest brother
my coffin shall be black six angels at my back two to sing and two to pray and two to carry my soul away
how beautiful and sad that was
how beautiful the words were where they said bury me in the old churchyard a tremor passed over his body
how sad and how beautiful
he wanted to cry quietly but not for himself for the words so beautiful and sad like music
the bell
the bell
farewell farewell
the cold sunlight was weaker and brother michael was standing at his bedside with a bowl of beeftea
he was glad for his mouth was hot and dry
he could hear them playing in the playgrounds
and the day was going on in the college just as if he were there
then brother michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in the paper
he told stephen that his name was athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to brother michael any time he wanted it because brother michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the paper they got every day up in the castle
there was every kind of news in the paper accidents shipwrecks sports and politics
now it is all about politics in the papers he said
do your people talk about that too
yes stephen said
mine too he said
then he thought for a moment and said you have a queer name dedalus and i have a queer name too athy
my name is the name of a town
your name is like latin
then he asked are you good at riddles
stephen answered not very good
then he said can you answer me this one
why is the county of kildare like the leg of a fellows breeches
stephen thought what could be the answer and then said give it up
because there is a thigh in it he said
do you see the joke
athy is the town in the county kildare and a thigh is the other thigh
oh i see stephen said an old riddle he said
after a moment he said say
what asked stephen
you know he said you can ask that riddle another way
can you said stephen
the same riddle he said
do you know the other way to ask it
no said stephen
can you not think of the other way he said
he looked at stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke
then he lay back on the pillow and said there is another way but i wonot tell you what it is
why did he not tell it
his father who kept the racehorses must be a magistrate too like father and nasty father
he thought of his own father of how he sang songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him that he was not a magistrate like the other boys fathers
then why was he sent to that place with them
but his father had told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years before
you could know the people of that time by their old dress
it seemed to him a solemn time and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows in clongowes wore blue coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grownup people and kept greyhounds of their own to course the hares with
he looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker
there would be cloudy grey light over the playgrounds
there was no noise on the playgrounds
the class must be doing the themes or perhaps father arnall was reading out of the book
it was queer that they had not given him any medicine
perhaps brother michael would bring it back when he came
they said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the infirmary
but he felt better now than before
it would be nice getting better slowly
you could get a book then
there was a book in the library about holland
there were lovely foreign names in it and pictures of strangelooking cities and ships
it made you feel so happy
how pale the light was at the window
but that was nice
the fire rose and fell on the wall
it was like waves
someone had put coal on and he heard voices
they were talking
it was the noise of the waves
or the waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell
he saw the sea of waves long dark waves rising and falling dark under the moonless night
a tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour
a tall man stood on the deck looking out towards the flat dark land and by the light at the pierhead he saw his face the sorrowful face of brother michael
he saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters he is dead
we saw him lying upon the catafalque
a wail of sorrow went up from the people
parnell
parnell
he is dead
they fell upon their knees moaning in sorrow
and he saw dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a green velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and silently past the people who knelt by the waters edge
a great fire banked high and red flamed in the grate and under the ivytwined branches of the chandelier the christmas table was spread
they had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready but it would be ready in a jiffy his mother had said
they were waiting for the door to open and for the servants to come in holding the big dishes covered with their heavy metal covers
all were waiting uncle charles who sat far away in the shadow of the window dante and mr casey who sat in the easychairs at either side of the hearth stephen seated on a chair between them his feet resting on the toasted boss
mr dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece waxed out his moustache ends and then parting his coat tails stood with his back to the glowing fire and still from time to time he withdrew a hand from his coat tail to wax out one of his moustache ends
mr casey leaned his head to one side and smiling tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers
and stephen smiled too for he knew now that it was not true that mr casey had a purse of silver in his throat
he smiled to think how the silvery noise which mr casey used to make had deceived him
and when he had tried to open mr hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened out and mr casey had told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a birthday present for queen victoria
mr casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at stephen with sleepy eyes and mr dedalus said to him yes
well now thats all right we had a good walk hadnot we john
yes
i wonder if theres any likelihood of dinner this evening
yes well now we got a good breath of ozone round the head today
ay bedad
he turned to dante and said you didnot stir out at all mrs riordan
dante frowned and said shortly no
mr dedalus dropped his coat tails and went over to the sideboard
he brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the locker and filled the decanter slowly bending now and then to see how much he had poured in
then replacing the jar in the locker he poured a little of the whisky into two glasses added a little water and came back with them to the fireplace thimbleful john he said just to whet your appetite
mr casey took the glass drank and placed it near him on the mantelpiece
then he said well i canot help thinking of our friend christopher manufacturing
he broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added that champagne for those fellows
mr dedalus laughed loudly
is it christy he said more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes
he inclined his head closed his eyes and licking his lips profusely began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper
and he has such a soft mouth when hes speaking to you donot you know very moist and watery about the dewlaps god bless him
mr casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and laughter
stephen seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through his fathers face and voice laughed
mr dedalus put up his eyeglass and staring down at him said quietly and kindly what are you laughing at you little puppy you
the servants entered and placed the dishes on the table
mrs dedalus followed and the places were arranged
sit over she said
mr dedalus went to the end of the table and said now mrs riordan sit over
john sit you down my hearty
he looked round to where uncle charles sat and said now then sir theres a bird here waiting for you
when all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover and then said quickly withdrawing it now stephen
stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals bless us lord and these thy gifts which through thy bounty we are about to receive through christ our lord
amen all blessed themselves and mr dedalus with a sigh of pleasure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around the edge with glistening drops
stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain trussed and skewered on the kitchen table
he knew that his father had paid a guinea for it in of dolier street and that the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good it was and he remembered the mans voice when he had said take that one sir the real ally daly
why did mr barrett in clongowes call his pandybat a turkey
but clongowes was far away and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and when dinner was ended the big plum pudding would be carried in studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag flying from the top
it was his first christmas dinner and he thought of his little brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery as he had often waited till the pudding came
the deep low collar and the eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish and that morning when his mother had brought him down to the parlour dressed for mass his father had cried
that was because he was thinking of his own father
and uncle charles had said so too
mr dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily
then he said poor old christy hes nearly lopsided now with roguery
simon said mrs dedalus you havenot given mrs riordan any sauce
mr dedalus seized the sauceboat he cried
mrs riordan pity the poor blind
dante covered her plate with her hands and said no thanks
mr dedalus turned to uncle charles
how are you off sir
right as the mail simon
you john all right
go on yourself
mary
here stephen heres something to make your hair curl
he poured sauce freely over plate and set the boat again on the table
then he asked uncle charles was it tender
uncle charles could not speak because his mouth was full but he nodded that it was
that was a good answer our friend made to the canon
what said mr dedalus didnot think he had that much in him said mr casey pay your dues father when you cease turning the house of god into a nice answer said dante for any man calling himself a catholic to give to his priest
they have only themselves to blame said mr dedalus suavely
if they took a fools advice they would confine their attention to religion
it is religion dante said
they are doing their duty in warning the people
we go to the house of god mr casey said in all humility to pray to our maker and not to hear election addresses
it is religion dante said again
they are right
they must direct their flocks
and preach politics from the altar is it asked mr dedalus
certainly said dante
it is a question of public morality
a priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is right and what is wrong
mrs dedalus laid down her knife and fork saying for pity sake and for pity sake let us have no political discussion on this day of all days in the year
quite right maam said uncle charles
now simon thats quite enough now
not another word now
yes yes said mr dedalus quickly
he uncovered the dish boldly and said now then whos for more turkey
nobody answered
dante said nice language for any catholic to use
mrs riordan i appeal to you said mrs dedalus to let the matter drop now
dante turned on her and said and am i to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church being flouted
nobody is saying a word against them said mr dedalus so long as they donot meddle in politics
the bishops and priests of ireland have spoken said dante and they must be obeyed
let them leave politics alone said mr casey or the people may leave their church alone
you hear said dante turning to mrs dedalus
mr casey
simon said mrs dedalus let it end now
too bad
too bad said uncle charles
what cried mr dedalus
were we to desert him at the bidding of the english people
he was no longer worthy to lead said dante
he was a public sinner
we are all sinners and black sinners said mr casey coldly
woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh said mrs riordan
it would be better for him that a millstone were tied about his neck and that he were cast into the depths of the sea rather than that he should scandalise one of these my least little ones that is the language of the holy ghost
and very bad language if you ask me said mr dedalus coolly
simon
simon said uncle charles
the boy
yes yes said mr dedalus
i meant about the
i was thinking about the bad language of the railway porter
well now thats all right
here stephen show me your plate old chap
eat away now
here
he heaped up the food on plate and served uncle charles and mr casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of sauce
mrs dedalus was eating little and dante sat with her hands in her lap
she was red in the face
mr dedalus rooted with the carvers at the end of the dish and said a tasty bit here we call the popes nose
if any lady or gentleman
he held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carvingfork
nobody spoke
he put it on his own plate saying well you canot say but you were asked
i think i had better eat it myself because not well in my health lately
he winked at stephen and replacing the dishcover began to eat again
there was a silence while he ate
then he said well now the day kept up fine after all
there were plenty of strangers down too
nobody spoke
he said again think there were more strangers down than last christmas
he looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards their plates and receiving no reply waited for a moment and said bitterly well my christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow
there could be neither luck nor grace dante said in a house where there is no respect for the pastors of the church
mr dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate
respect he said
is it for billy with the lip or for the tub of guts up in armagh
respect
princes of the church said mr casey with slow scorn
lord coachman yes said mr dedalus
they are the anointed dante said
they are an honour to their country
tub of guts said mr dedalus coarsely
he has a handsome face mind you in repose
you should see that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winters day
johnny
he twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and made a lapping noise with his lips
really simon you should not speak that way before stephen not right hell remember all this when he grows up said dante hotlythe language he heard against god and religion and priests in his own home
let him remember too cried mr casey to her from across the table the language with which the priests and the priests pawns broke heart and hounded him into his grave
let him remember that too when he grows up
sons of bitches cried mr dedalus
when he was down they turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a sewer
lowlived dogs
and they look it
by christ they look it
they behaved rightly cried dante
they obeyed their bishops and their priests
honour to them
well it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day in the year said mrs dedalus can we be free from these dreadful disputes
uncle charles raised his hands mildly and said come now come now come now
can we not have our opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this bad language
it is too bad surely
mrs dedalus spoke to dante in a low voice but dante said loudly will not say nothing
i will defend my church and my religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics
mr casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the table and resting his elbows before him said in a hoarse voice to his host tell me did i tell you that story about a very famous spit
you did not john said mr dedalus
why then said mr casey it is a most instructive story
it happened not long ago in the county wicklow where we are now
he broke off and turning towards dante said with quiet indignation and i may tell you maam that if you mean me am no renegade catholic
i am a catholic as my father was and his father before him and his father before him again when we gave up our lives rather than sell our faith
the more shame to you now dante said to speak as you do
the story john said mr dedalus smiling
let us have the story anyhow
catholic indeed repeated dante ironically
the blackest protestant in the land would not speak the language i have heard this evening
mr dedalus began to sway his head to and fro crooning like a country singer am no protestant i tell you again said mr casey flushing
mr dedalus still crooning and swaying his head began to sing in a grunting nasal tone come all you roman catholics that never went to mass
he took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set to eating saying to mr casey let us have the story john
it will help us to digest
stephen looked with affection at mr face which stared across the table over his joined hands
he liked to sit near him at the fire looking up at his dark fierce face
but his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to
but why was he then against the priests
because dante must be right then
but he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies
perhaps that made her severe against parnell
and she did not like him to play with eileen because eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the blessed virgin
tower of ivory they used to say house of gold how could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold
who was right then
and he remembered the evening in the infirmary in clongowes the dark waters the light at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard
eileen had long white hands
one evening when playing tig she had put her hands over his eyes long and white and thin and cold and soft
that was ivory a cold white thing
that was the meaning of tower of ivory
the story is very short and sweet mr casey said
it was one day down in arklow a cold bitter day not long before the chief died
may god have mercy on him
he closed his eyes wearily and paused
mr dedalus took a bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth saying before he was killed you mean
mr casey opened his eyes sighed and went on it was down in arklow one day
we were down there at a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railway station through the crowd
such booing and baaing man you never heard
they called us all the names in the world
well there was one old lady and a drunken old harridan she was surely that paid all her attention to me
she kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and screaming into my face priesthunter
the paris funds
mr fox
kitty and what did you do john asked mr dedalus let her bawl away said mr casey
it was a cold day and to keep up my heart i had saving your presence maam a quid of tullamore in my mouth and sure i couldnot say a word in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice
well john
well
i let her bawl away to her hearts content kitty oshea and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that i wonot sully this christmas board nor your ears maam nor my own lips by repeating
he paused
mr dedalus lifting his head from the bone asked and what did you do john
do said mr casey
she stuck her ugly old face up at me when she said it and i had my mouth full of tobacco juice
i bent down to her and phth says i to her like that
he turned aside and made the act of spitting says i to her like that right into her eye
he clapped his hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of pain
jesus mary and joseph says she blinded blinded and drownded he stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter repeating blinded entirely
mr dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while uncle charles swayed his head to and fro
dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they laughed very nice
ha
very nice
it was not nice about the spit in the womans eye
but what was the name the woman had called kitty oshea that mr casey would not repeat
he thought of mr casey walking through the crowds of people and making speeches from a wagonette
that was what he had been in prison for and he remembered that one night sergeant oneill had come to the house and had stood in the hall talking in a low voice with his father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap
and that night mr casey had not gone to dublin by train but a car had come to the door and he had heard his father say something about the cabinteely road
he was for ireland and parnell and so was his father and so was dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band played god save the queen at the end
mr dedalus gave a snort of contempt
ah john he said
it is true for them
we are an unfortunate priestridden race and always were and always will be till the end of the chapter
uncle charles shook his head saying bad business
a bad business
mr dedalus repeated priestridden godforsaken race
he pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to his right
do you see that old chap up there john he said
he was a good irishman when there was no money in the job
he was condemned to death as a whiteboy
but he had a saying about our clerical friends that he would never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany
dante broke in angrily if we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud of it
they are the apple of eye
touch them not says christ for they are the apple of my eye and can we not love our country then asked mr casey
are we not to follow the man that was born to lead us traitor to his country replied dante
a traitor an adulterer
the priests were right to abandon him
the priests were always the true friends of ireland
were they faith said mr casey
he threw his fist on the table and frowning angrily protruded one finger after another the bishops of ireland betray us in the time of the union when bishop lanigan presented an address of loyalty to the marquess cornwallis the bishops and priests sell the aspirations of their country in in return for catholic emancipation they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box
and didnot they dishonour the ashes of terence bellew his face was glowing with anger and stephen felt the glow rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him
mr dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn by god he cried i forgot little old paul cullen
another apple of eye
dante bent across the table and cried to mr casey right
right
they were always right
god and morality and religion come first
mrs dedalus seeing her excitement said to her mrs riordan donot excite yourself answering them
god and religion before everything
dante cried
god and religion before the world
mr casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on the table with a crash
very well then he shouted hoarsely if it comes to that no god for ireland
john
john cried mr dedalus seizing his guest by the coat sleeve
dante stared across the table her cheeks shaking
mr casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards her scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb
no god for ireland he cried
we have had too much god in ireland
away with god
blasphemer
devil screamed dante starting to her feet and almost spitting in his face
uncle charles and mr dedalus pulled mr casey back into his chair again talking to him from both sides reasonably
he stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes repeating away with god i say
dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table upsetting her napkinring which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to rest against the foot of an easychair
mrs dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door
at the door dante turned round violently and shouted down the room her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage devil out of hell
we won
we crushed him to death
fiend
the door slammed behind her
mr casey freeing his arms from his holders suddenly bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain
poor parnell he cried loudly
my dead king
he sobbed loudly and bitterly
stephen raising his terrorstricken face saw that his fathers eyes were full of tears
the fellows talked together in little groups
one fellow said they were caught near the hill of lyons
who caught them
mr gleeson and the minister
they were on a car
the same fellow added fellow in the higher line told me
fleming asked but why did they run away tell us know why cecil thunder said
because they had fecked cash out of the rectors room
who fecked it brother
and they all went shares in it
but that was stealing
how could they have done that fat lot you know about it thunder
wells said
i know why they scut
tell us why was told not to wells said go on wells all said
you might tell us
we wonot let it out
stephen bent forward his head to hear
wells looked round to see if anyone was coming
then he said secretly you know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy
yes
well they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell
and thats why they ran away if you want to know
and the fellow who had spoken first said yes thats what i heard too from the fellow in the higher line
the fellows all were silent
stephen stood among them afraid to speak listening
a faint sickness of awe made him feel weak
how could they have done that
he thought of the dark silent sacristy
there were dark wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded
it was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath
it was a holy place
he remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer the evening of the procession to the little altar in the wood
a strange and holy place
the boy that held the censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the silvery cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting
that was called charcoal and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell
and then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals
the fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on the playground
the fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller that was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before a fellow out of second of grammar
he had been thrown by the fellows machine lightly on the cinderpath and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth
that was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up
but there was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming and some said that barnes would be prof and some said it would be flowers
and all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and lobs
and from here and from there came the sounds of the cricket bats through the soft grey air
they said pick pack pock puck little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the brimming bowl
athy who had been silent said quietly you are all wrong
all turned towards him eagerly
why
do you know
who told you
tell us athy
athy pointed across the playground to where simon moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him
ask him he said
the fellows looked there and then said why him
is he in it
athy lowered his voice and said do you know why those fellows scut
i will tell you but you must not let on you know
tell us athy
go on
you might if you know
he paused for a moment and then said mysteriously they were caught with simon moonan and tusker boyle in the square one night
the fellows looked at him and asked caught
what doing
athy said smugging
all the fellows were silent and athy said and thats why
stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking across the playground
he wanted to ask somebody about it
what did that mean about the smugging in the square
why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that
it was a joke he thought
simon moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at the door
it was the night of the match against the bective rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets
and one day boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called tusker boyle but some fellows called him lady boyle because he was always at his nails paring them
eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl
they were like ivory only soft
that was the meaning of tower of ivory but protestants could not understand it and made fun of it
one day he had stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds
a waiter was running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn
she had put her hand into his pocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand was
she had said that pockets were funny things to have and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the sloping curve of the path
her fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun
tower of ivory
house of gold by thinking of things you could understand them
but why in the square
you went there when you wanted to do something
it was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale water there
and behind the door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the drawing balbus was building a wall some fellow had drawn it there for a cod
it had a funny face but it was very like a man with a beard
and on the wall of another closet there was written in backhand in beautiful writing julius csar wrote the calico belly perhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some fellows wrote things for cod
but all the same it was queer what athy said and the way he said it
it was not a cod because they had run away
he looked with the others across the playground and began to feel afraid
at last fleming said and we are all to be punished for what other fellows did wonot come back see if i do cecil thunder said
three days silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight every minute
yes said wells
and old barrett has a new way of twisting the note so that you canot open it and fold it again to see how many ferul you are to get
i wonot come back too
yes said cecil thunder and the prefect of studies was in second of grammar this morning
let us get up a rebellion fleming said
will we
all the fellows were silent
the air was very silent and you could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before pick pock
wells asked what is going to be done to them
simon moonan and tusker are going to be flogged athy said and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or being expelled
and which are they taking asked the fellow who had spoken first
all are taking expulsion except corrigan athy answered going to be flogged by mr gleeson know why cecil thunder said
he is right and the other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life on account of it
besides gleeson wonot flog him hard best of his play not to fleming said wouldnot like to be simon moonan and tusker cecil thunder said
but i donot believe they will be flogged
perhaps they will be sent up for twice nine
no no said athy both get it on the vital spot
wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice please sir let me off
athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket saying it canot be helped it must be done
so down with your breeches and out with your bum
the fellows laughed but he felt that they were a little afraid
in the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and from there pock
that was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain
the pandybat made a sound too but not like that
the fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside and he wondered what was the pain like
there were different kinds of sounds
a long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like
it made him shivery to think of it and cold and what athy said too
but what was there to laugh at in it
it made him shivery but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let down your trousers
it was the same in the bath when you undressed yourself
he wondered who had to let them down the master or the boy himself how could they laugh about it that way
he looked at rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky hands
he had rolled up his sleeves to show how mr gleeson would roll up his sleeves
but mr gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed
perhaps he pared them too like lady boyle
but they were terribly long and pointed nails
so long and cruel they were though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle
and though he trembled with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands clean and strong and gentle
and he thought of what cecil thunder had said that mr gleeson would not flog corrigan hard
and fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to
but that was not why
a voice from far out on the playground cried all in
and other voices cried all in
all in
during the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded listening to the slow scraping of the pens
mr harford went to and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him how to hold his pen
he had tried to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book
zeal without prudence is like a ship adrift but the lines of the letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out the full curves of the capital
but mr harford was very decent and never got into a wax
all the other masters got into dreadful waxes
but why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did
wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell
perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere
that must have been a terrible sin to go in there quietly at night to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which god was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and dominic kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir
but god was not in it of course when they stole it
but still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it
he thought of it with deep awe a terrible and strange sin it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly
but to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too but it was not terrible and strange
it only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine
because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rectors breath after the wine of the mass
the word was beautiful wine
it made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in greece outside houses like white temples
but the faint smell of the rectors breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion
the day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life
and once a lot of generals had asked napoleon what was the happiest day of his life
they thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor
but he said gentlemen the happiest day of my life was the day on which i made my first holy communion
father arnall came in and the latin lesson began and he remained still leaning on the desk with his arms folded
father arnall gave out the themebooks and he said that they were scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with the corrections at once
but the worst of all was theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot and father arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to any master to send him up such a theme
then he asked jack lawton to decline the noun mare and jack lawton stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural
you should be ashamed of yourself said father arnall sternly
you the leader of the class
then he asked the next boy and the next and the next
nobody knew
father arnall became very quiet more and more quiet as each boy tried to answer it and could not
but his face was blacklooking and his eyes were staring though his voice was so quiet
then he asked fleming and fleming said that the word had no plural
father arnall suddenly shut the book and shouted at him kneel out there in the middle of the class
you are one of the idlest boys i ever met
copy out your themes again the rest of you
fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last benches
the other boys bent over their themebooks and began to write
a silence filled the classroom and stephen glancing timidly at father dark face saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in
was that a sin for father arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a wax
it was because he was allowed because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do it
but if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to confession
perhaps he would go to confession to the minister
and if the minister did it he would go to the rector and the rector to the provincial and the provincial to the general of the jesuits
that was called the order and he had heard his father say that they were all clever men
they could all have become highup people in the world if they had not become jesuits
and he wondered what father arnall and paddy barrett would have become and what mr and mr gleeson would have become if they had not become jesuits
it was hard to think what because you would have to think of them in a different way with different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats
the door opened quietly and closed
a quick whisper ran through the class the prefect of studies
there was an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk heart leapt up in fear
any boys want flogging here father arnall cried the prefect of studies
any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class
he came to the middle of the class and saw fleming on his knees
hoho he cried
who is this boy
why is he on his knees
what is your name boy
fleming sir
hoho fleming
an idler of course
i can see it in your eye
why is he on his knees father arnall
he wrote a bad latin theme father arnall said and he missed all the questions in grammar
of course he did cried the prefect of studies of course he did
a born idler
i can see it in the corner of his eye
he banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried up fleming
up my boy
fleming stood up slowly
hold out cried the prefect of studies
fleming held out his hand
the pandybat came down on it with a loud smacking sound one two three four five six
other hand
the pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks
kneel down cried the prefect of studies
fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits his face contorted with pain but stephen knew how hard his hands were because fleming was always rubbing rosin into them
but perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible heart was beating and fluttering
at your work all of you shouted the prefect of studies
we want no lazy idle loafers here lazy idle little schemers
at your work i tell you
father dolan will be in to see you every day
father dolan will be in tomorrow
he poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat saying you boy
when will father dolan be in again
tomorrow sir said tom voice
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow said the prefect of studies
make up your minds for that
every day father dolan
write away
you boy who are you heart jumped suddenly
dedalus sir
why are you not writing like the others my
he could not speak with fright
why is he not writing father arnall
he broke his glasses said father arnall and i exempted him from work
broke
what is this i hear
what is this
your name is said the prefect of studies
dedalus sir
out here dedalus
lazy little schemer
i see schemer in your face
where did you break your glasses
stephen stumbled into the middle of the class blinded by fear and haste
where did you break your glasses repeated the prefect of studies
the cinderpath sir
hoho
the cinderpath cried the prefect of studies
i know that trick
stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment father whitegrey not young face his baldy whitegrey head with fluff at the sides of it the steel rims of his spectacles and his nocoloured eyes looking through the glasses
why did he say he knew that trick
lazy idle little loafer cried the prefect of studies
broke my glasses
an old schoolboy trick
out with your hand this moment
stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand with the palm upwards
he felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike
a hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire and at the sound and the pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes
his whole body was shaking with fright his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air
a cry sprang to his lips a prayer to be let off
but though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat
other hand shouted the prefect of studies
stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his left hand
the soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass
the scalding water burst forth from his eyes and burning with shame and agony and fear he drew back his shaking arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain
his body shook with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his flaming cheeks
kneel down cried the prefect of studies
stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides
to think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone elses that he felt sorry for
and as he knelt calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides he thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly in the air
get at your work all of you cried the prefect of studies from the door
father dolan will be in every day to see if any boy any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging
every day
every day
the door closed behind him
the hushed class continued to copy out the themes
father arnall rose from his seat and went among them helping the boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had made
his voice was very gentle and soft
then he returned to his seat and said to fleming and stephen you may return to your places you two
fleming and stephen rose and walking to their seats sat down
stephen scarlet with shame opened a book quickly with one weak hand and bent down upon it his face close to the page
it was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to read without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to send him a new pair
and father arnall had said that he need not study till the new glasses came
then to be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the yorkists
how could the prefect of studies know that it was a trick
he felt the touch of the prefects fingers as they had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash
it was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then and father arnall had told them both that they might return to their places without making any difference between them
he listened to father low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes
perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent
but it was unfair and cruel
the prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and unfair
and his whitegrey face and the nocoloured eyes behind the steel rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder a stinking mean thing thats what it is said fleming in the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refectory to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault
you really broke your glasses by accident didnot you
nasty roche asked
stephen felt his heart filled by words and did not answer
of course he did said fleming
i wouldnot stand it go up and tell the rector on him
yes said cecil thunder eagerly and i saw him lift the pandybat over his shoulder and hes not allowed to do that
did they hurt you much
nasty roche asked
very much stephen said wouldnot stand it fleming repeated from baldyhead or any other baldyhead a stinking mean low trick thats what it is go straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner
yes do
yes do said cecil thunder
yes do
yes go up and tell the rector on him dedalus said nasty roche because he said that hed come in tomorrow again and pandy you
yes yes
tell the rector all said
and there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one of them said the senate and the roman people declared that dedalus had been wrongly punished
it was wrong it was unfair and cruel and as he sat in the refectory he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see
but there could not be and it was unjust and cruel and unfair
he could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it
yes he would do what the fellows had told him
he would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly punished
a thing like that had been done before by somebody in history by some great person whose head was in the books of history
and the rector would declare that he had been wrongly punished because the senate and the roman people always declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished
those were the great men whose names were in richmal questions
history was all about those men and what they did and that was what peter tales about greece and rome were all about
peter parley himself was on the first page in a picture
there was a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes and peter parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking fast along the road to greece and rome
it was easy what he had to do
all he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle
he had nothing to do but that to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rectors room
and every fellow had said that it was unfair even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the roman people
what would happen
he heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down the matting paddy rath and jimmy magee and the spaniard and the portuguese and the fifth was big corrigan who was going to be flogged by mr gleeson
that was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and pandied him for nothing and straining his weak eyes tired with the tears he watched big broad shoulders and big hanging black head passing in the file
but he had done something and besides mr gleeson would not flog him hard and he remembered how big corrigan looked in the bath
he had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat
the refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out in file
he could go up the staircase because there was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door
but he could not go
the rector would side with the prefect of studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the same only it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow going up to the rector about him
the fellows had told him to go but they would not go themselves
they had forgotten all about it
no it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studies had only said he would come in
no it was best to hide out of the way because when you were small and young you could often escape that way
the fellows at his table stood up
he stood up and passed out among them in the file
he had to decide
he was coming near the door
if he went on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for that
and if he went and was pandied all the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about young dedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies
he was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him
it was impossible he could not
he thought of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel nocoloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was
why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time
was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of the name
the great men in the history had names like that and nobody made fun of them
it was his own name that he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun
dolan it was like the name of a woman who washed clothes
he had reached the door and turning quickly up to the right walked up the stairs and before he could make up his mind to come back he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle
and as he crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw without turning his head to look that all the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by
he passed along the narrow dark corridor passing little doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community
he peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be portraits
it was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not see
but he thought they were the portraits of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him silently as he passed saint ignatius loyola holding an open book and pointing to the words ad majorem dei gloriam in it saint francis xavier pointing to his chest lorenzo ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines the three patrons of holy youth saint stanislaus kostka saint aloysius gonzago and blessed john berchmans all with young faces because they died when they were young and father peter kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak
he came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about him
that was where hamilton rowan had passed and the marks of the soldiers slugs were there
and it was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal
an old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing
he asked him where was the rectors room and the old servant pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked
there was no answer
he knocked again more loudly and his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say come in
he turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle of the green baize door inside
he found it and pushed it open and went in
he saw the rector sitting at a desk writing
there was a skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of chairs
his heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in and the silence of the room and he looked at the skull and at the rectors kindlooking face
well my little man said the rector what is it
stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said broke my glasses sir
the rector opened his mouth and said then he smiled and said well if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair wrote home sir said stephen and father arnall said i am not to study till they come
quite right said the rector
stephen swallowed down the thing again and tried to keep his legs and his voice from shaking
but sir
yes
father dolan came in today and pandied me because i was not writing my theme
the rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes
the rector said your name is dedalus isnot it
yes sir
and where did you break your glasses
on the cinderpath sir
a fellow was coming out of the bicycle house and i fell and they got broken
i donot know the fellows name
the rector looked at him again in silence
then he smiled and said well it was a mistake i am sure father dolan did not know
but i told him i broke them sir and he pandied me
did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair the rector asked
no sir well then said the rector father dolan did not understand
you can say that i excuse you from your lessons for a few days
stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent him yes sir but father dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy me again for it
very well the rector said it is a mistake and i shall speak to father dolan myself
will that do now
stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured yes sir thanks
the rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skull was and stephen placing his hand in it for a moment felt a cool moist palm
good day now said the rector withdrawing his hand and bowing
good day sir said stephen
he bowed and walked quietly out of the room closing the doors carefully and slowly
but when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster
faster and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly
he bumped his elbow against the door at the end and hurrying down the staircase walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air
he could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds
he broke into a run and running quicker and quicker ran across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground panting
the fellows had seen him running
they closed round him in a ring pushing one against another to hear
tell us
tell us
what did he say
did you go in
what did he say
tell us
tell us
he told them what he had said and what the rector had said and when he had told them all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into the air and cried hurroo
they caught their caps and sent them up again spinning skyhigh and cried again hurroo
hurroo
they made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get free
and when he had escaped from them they broke away in all directions flinging their caps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up and crying hurroo
and they gave three groans for baldyhead dolan and three cheers for conmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever in clongowes
the cheers died away in the soft grey air
he was alone
he was happy and free but he would not be anyway proud with father dolan
he would be very quiet and obedient and he wished that he could do something kind for him to show him that he was not proud
the air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming
there was the smell of evening in the air the smell of the fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went out for a walk to major the smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were
the fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slow twisters
in the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of the balls and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the cricket bats pick pack pock puck like drops of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl
chapter uncle charles smoked such black twist that at last his nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden
very good simon
all serene simon said the old man tranquilly
anywhere you like
the outhouse will do me nicely it will be more salubrious
damn me said mr dedalus frankly if i know how you can smoke such villainous awful tobacco like gunpowder by god very nice simon replied the old man
very cool and mollifying
every morning therefore uncle charles repaired to his outhouse but not before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat
while he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door
his arbour as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat and the garden tools served him also as a soundingbox and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite songs twine me a bower or blue eyes and golden hair or the groves of blarney while the grey and blue coils of smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air
during the first part of the summer in blackrock uncle charles was constant companion
uncle charles was a hale old man with a well tanned skin rugged features and white side whiskers
on week days he did messages between the house in carysfort avenue and those shops in the main street of the town with which the family dealt
stephen was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter
he would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four american apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephews hand while the shopman smiled uneasily and on feigning reluctance to take them he would frown and say take them sir
do you hear me sir good for your bowels
when the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an old friend of father mike flynn would be found seated on a bench waiting for them
then would begin run round the park
mike flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station watch in hand while stephen ran round the track in the style mike flynn favoured his head high lifted his knees well lifted and his hands held straight down by his sides
when the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes
a small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and politics
though he had heard his father say that mike flynn had put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands stephen often glanced at his trainers flabby stubblecovered face as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch
on the way home uncle charles would often pay a visit to the chapel and as the font was above reach the old man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about clothes and on the floor of the porch
while he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his breath from a thumb blackened prayerbook wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page
stephen knelt at his side respecting though he did not share his piety
he often wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously
perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that god might send him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in cork
on sundays stephen with his father and his granduncle took their constitutional
the old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered
the little village of stillorgan was the parting of the ways
either they went to the left towards the dublin mountains or along the goatstown road and thence into dundrum coming home by sandyford
trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts of irish politics of munster and of the legends of their own family to all of which stephen lent an avid ear
words which he did not understand he said over and over to himself till he had learnt them by heart and through them he had glimpses of the real world about them
the hour when he too would take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended
his evenings were his own and he pored over a ragged translation of the count of monte cristo
the figure of that dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible
at night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which chocolate is wrapped
when he had broken up this scenery weary of its tinsel there would come to his mind the bright picture of marseilles of sunny trellises and of mercedes
outside blackrock on the road that led to the mountains stood a small whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes and in this house he told himself another mercedes lived
both on the outward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by this landmark and in his imagination he lived through a long train of adventures marvellous as those in the book itself towards the close of which there appeared an image of himself grown older and sadder standing in a moonlit garden with mercedes who had so many years before slighted his love and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal saying madam i never eat muscatel grapes
he became the ally of a boy named aubrey mills and founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue
aubrey carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs
stephen who had read of plain style of dress chose to remain unadorned and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with his lieutenant before giving orders
the gang made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks coming home after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair
aubrey and stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the milkcar to carrickmines where the cows were at grass
while the men were milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mare round the field
but when autumn came the cows were driven home from the grass and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming bran troughs sickened heart
the cattle which had seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded
the coming of september did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to clongowes
the practice in the park came to an end when mike flynn went into hospital
aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening
the gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks
stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkmans coat
whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door
he thought it should be a pleasant life enough driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from
but the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainers flabby stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers dissipated any vision of the future
in a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to clongowes
for some time he had felt the slight change in his house and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world
the ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet
a dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mares hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the rock road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him
he returned to mercedes and as he brooded upon her image a strange unrest crept into his blood
sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue
the peace of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart
the noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel even more keenly than he had felt at clongowes that he was different from others
he did not want to play
he wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld
he did not know where to seek it or how but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would without any overt act of his encounter him
they would meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place
they would be alone surrounded by darkness and silence and in that moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured
he would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and then in a moment he would be transfigured
weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment
two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and men had come tramping into the house to dismantle it
the furniture had been hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate
when all had been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue and from the window of the railway carriage in which he had sat with his redeyed mother stephen had seen them lumbering along the merrion road
the parlour fire would not draw that evening and mr dedalus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame
uncle charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned against the wall
the lamp on the table shed a weak light over the boarded floor muddied by the feet of the vanmen
stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and incoherent monologue
he understood little or nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that some fight was going to take place
he felt too that he was being enlisted for the fight that some duty was being laid upon his shoulders
the sudden flight from the comfort and reverie of blackrock the passage through the gloomy foggy city the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy and again an intuition a foreknowledge of the future came to him
he understood also why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his back to the fire talking loudly to uncle charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner a crack of the whip left in me yet stephen old chap said mr dedalus poking at the dull fire with fierce energy not dead yet sonny
no by the lord jesus god forgive me nor half dead
dublin was a new and complex sensation
uncle charles had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left stephen freer than he had been in blackrock
in the beginning he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring square or at most going half way down one of the side streets but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the custom house
he passed unchallenged among the docks and along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum at the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the illdressed bearded policeman
the vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of mercedes
and amid this new bustling life he might have fancied himself in another marseilles but that he missed the bright sky and the sunwarmed trellises of the wineshops
a vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really sought someone that eluded him
he went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for christmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him
the causes of his embitterment were many remote and near
he was angry with himself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulses angry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity
yet his anger lent nothing to the vision
he chronicled with patience what he saw detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret
he was sitting on the backless chair in his aunts kitchen
a lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees
she looked a long time at a smiling picture that was set in it and said musingly the beautiful mabel hunter
a ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and said softly what is she in mud
in a pantomime love
the child leaned her ringletted head against her mothers sleeve gazing on the picture and murmured as if fascinated the beautiful mabel hunter
as if fascinated her eyes rested long upon those demurely taunting eyes and she murmured devotedly she an exquisite creature
and the boy who came in from the street stamping crookedly under his stone of coal heard her words
he dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see
he mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see
he was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old darkwindowed house
the firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the river
before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and as she bustled at the task she told in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said
she told too of certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and sayings
he sat listening to the words and following the ways of adventure that lay open in the coals arches and vaults and winding galleries and jagged caverns
suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway
a skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway
a feeble creature like a monkey was there drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire
a whining voice came from the door asking is that josephine
the old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace no ellen its stephen good evening stephen
he answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over the face in the doorway
do you want anything ellen asked the old woman at the fire
but she did not answer the question and said thought it was josephine
i thought you were josephine stephen
and repeating this several times she fell to laughing feebly
he was sitting in the midst of a childrens party at cross
his silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little part in the games
the children wearing the spoils of their crackers danced and romped noisily and though he tried to share their merriment he felt himself a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets
but when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness
the mirth which in the beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial was like a soothing air to him passing gaily by his senses hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid the music and laughter her glance travelled to his corner flattering taunting searching exciting his heart
in the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on their things the party was over
she had thrown a shawl about her and as they went together towards the tram sprays of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road
it was the last tram
the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition
the conductor talked with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp
on the empty seats of the tram were scattered a few coloured tickets
no sound of footsteps came up or down the road
no sound broke the peace of the night save when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their bells
they seemed to listen he on the upper step and she on the lower
she came up to his step many times and went down to hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some moments on the upper step forgetting to go down and then went down
his heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide
he heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past whether in life or reverie he had heard their tale before
he saw her urge her vanities her fine dress and sash and long black stockings and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times
yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart asking him would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand
and he remembered the day when he and eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn and how all of a sudden she had broken out into a peal of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path
now as then he stood listlessly in his place seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before him
she too wants me to catch hold of her he thought why she came with me to the tram
i could easily catch hold of her when she comes up to my step nobody is looking
i could hold her and kiss her
but he did neither and when he was sitting alone in the deserted tram he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the corrugated footboard
the next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours
before him lay a new pen a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise
from force of habit he had written at the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto on the first line of the page appeared the title of the verses he was trying to write to he knew it was right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected poems of lord byron
when he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book
he saw himself sitting at his table in bray the morning after the discussion at the christmas dinner table trying to write a poem about parnell on the back of one of his fathers second moiety notices
but his brain had then refused to grapple with the theme and desisting he had covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates roderick kickham john lawton anthony simon moonan now it seemed as if he would fail again but by dint of brooding on the incident he thought himself into confidence
during this process all those elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the scene
there remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses nor did he and she appear vividly
the verses told only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon
some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and when the moment of farewell had come the kiss which had been withheld by one was given by both
after this the letters were written at the foot of the page and having hidden the book he went into his mothers bedroom and gazed at his face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable
but his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end
one evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through dinner
stephen had been awaiting his fathers return for there had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the gravy
but he did not relish the hash for the mention of clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust walked bang into him said mr dedalus for the fourth time just at the corner of the square
then i suppose said mrs dedalus he will be able to arrange it
i mean about belvedere
of course he will said mr dedalus
i tell you hes provincial of the order now never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers myself said mrs dedalus
christian brothers be damned said mr dedalus
is it with paddy stink and micky mud
no let him stick to the jesuits in name since he began with them be of service to him in after years
those are the fellows that can get you a position
and theyre a very rich order arenot they simon
rather
they live well i tell you
you saw their table at clongowes
fed up by god like gamecocks
mr dedalus pushed his plate over to stephen and bade him finish what was on it
now then stephen he said you must put your shoulder to the wheel old chap had a fine long holiday sure hell work very hard now said mrs dedalus especially when he has maurice with him
holy paul i forgot about maurice said mr dedalus
here maurice
come here you thickheaded ruffian
do you know going to send you to a college where theyll teach you to spell cat cat
and buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose dry that be grand fun
maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother
mr dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both his sons
stephen mumbled his bread without answering his fathers gaze
by the bye said mr dedalus at length the rector or provincial rather was telling me that story about you and father dolan an impudent thief he said he didnot simon
not he said mr dedalus
but he gave me a great account of the whole affair
we were chatting you know and one word borrowed another
and by the way who do you think he told me will get that job in the corporation
but tell you that after
well as i was saying we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still and then he told me the whole story
and was he annoyed simon
annoyed
not he
manly little chap he said
mr dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial
father dolan and when i told them all at dinner about it father dolan and i had a great laugh over it
you better mind yourself father dolan said or young dedalus will send you up for twice nine
we had a famous laugh together over it
ha
ha
ha
mr dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there a jesuit for your life for diplomacy
he reassumed the provincials voice and repeated told them all at dinner about it and father dolan and i and all of us we had a hearty laugh together over it
ha
ha

the night of the whitsuntide play had come and stephen from the window of the dressingroom looked out on the small grassplot across which lines of chinese lanterns were stretched
he watched the visitors come down the steps from the house and pass into the theatre
stewards in evening dress old belvedereans loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony
under the sudden glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a priest
the blessed sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space before it free
against the walls stood companies of barbells and indian clubs the dumbbells were piled in one corner and in the midst of countless hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display
stephen though in deference to his reputation for essay writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium had had no part in the first section of the programme but in the play which formed the second section he had the chief part that of a farcical pedagogue
he had been cast for it on account of his stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his second year at belvedere and in number two
a score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets came pattering down from the stage through the vestry and into the chapel
the vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys
the plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse
the lean young man in a long overcoat who was to give a special display of intricate club swinging stood near watching with interest his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep sidepockets
the hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage and in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like a flock of geese flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste
a little troop of neapolitan peasants were practising their steps at the end of the chapel some circling their arms above their heads some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtseying
in a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts
when she stood up a pinkdressed figure wearing a curly golden wig and an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet with black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered was discovered
a low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure
one of the prefects smiling and nodding his head approached the dark corner and having bowed to the stout old lady said pleasantly is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here mrs tallon
then bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf of the bonnet he exclaimed no
upon my word i believe its little bertie tallon after all
stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh together and heard the boys murmurs of admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself
a movement of impatience escaped him
he let the edge of the blind fall and stepping down from the bench on which he had been standing walked out of the chapel
he passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked the garden
from the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers band
the light spread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive ark anchored among the hulks of houses her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moorings
a side door of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of light flew across the grassplots
a sudden burst of music issued from the ark the prelude of a waltz and when the side door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music
the sentiment of the opening bars their languor and supple movement evoked the incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of all his days unrest and of his impatient movement of a moment before
his unrest issued from him like a wave of sound and on the tide of flowing music the ark was journeying trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake
then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement
it was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage
at the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint aromatic odour
two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway smoking and before he reached them he had recognised heron by his voice
here comes the noble dedalus cried a high throaty voice
welcome to our trusty friend
this welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane
here i am said stephen halting and glancing from heron to his friend
the latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness by the aid of the glowing cigarette tips he could make out a pale dandyish face over which a smile was travelling slowly a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat
heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead was just telling my friend wallis what a lark it would be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster
it would be a ripping good joke
heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend wallis the rectors pedantic bass and then laughing at his failure asked stephen to do it
go on dedalus he urged you can take him off rippingly
he that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as the heathena and the publicana the imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged
damn this blankety blank holder he said taking it from his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly always getting stuck like that
do you use a holder donot smoke answered stephen
no said heron dedalus is a model youth
he doesnot smoke and he doesnot go to bazaars and he doesnot flirt and he doesnot damn anything or damn all
stephen shook his head and smiled in his rivals flushed and mobile face beaked like a birds
he had often thought it strange that vincent heron had a birds face as well as a birds name
a shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive
the rivals were school friends
they sat together in class knelt together in the chapel talked together after beads over their lunches
as the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards stephen and heron had been during the year the virtual heads of the school
it was they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off by the way said heron suddenly i saw your governor going in
the smile waned on face
any allusion made to his father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment
he waited in timorous silence to hear what heron might say next
heron however nudged him expressively with his elbow and said a sly dog
why so said stephen think butter wouldnot melt in your mouth said heron
but afraid youre a sly dog
might i ask you what you are talking about said stephen urbanely
indeed you might answered heron
we saw her wallis didnot we
and deucedly pretty she is too
and inquisitive
and what part does stephen take mr dedalus
and will stephen not sing mr dedalus your governor was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that i think the old man has found you out too
i wouldnot care a bit by jove ripping isnot she wallis
not half bad answered wallis quietly as he placed his holder once more in a corner of his mouth
a shaft of momentary anger flew through mind at these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger
for him there was nothing amusing in a girls interest and regard
all day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the steps of the tram at cross the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he had written about it
all day he had imagined a new meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play
the old restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on the night of the party but had not found an outlet in verse
the growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and now forbidding such an outlet and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and eddies wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience
so you may as well admit heron went on that weve fairly found you out this time
you canot play the saint on me any more thats one sure five
a soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and bending down as before he struck stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with his cane as if in jesting reproof moment of anger had already passed
he was neither flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to end
he scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words and his face mirrored his rivals false smile
admit repeated heron striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg
the stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had been
stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly and bowing submissively as if to meet his companions jesting mood began to recite the confiteor
the episode ended well for both heron and wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence
the confession came only from lips and while they spoke the words a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up as if by magic at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition admit
it was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was in number six
his sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life
his soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon of dublin
he had emerged from a two years spell of reverie to find himself in the midst of a new scene every event and figure of which affected him intimately disheartened him or allured and whether alluring or disheartening filled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts
all the leisure which his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings
the essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every tuesday as he marched from home to the school he read his fate in the incidents of the way pitting himself against some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly essay
on a certain tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken
mr tate the english master pointed his finger at him and said bluntly this fellow has heresy in his essay
a hush fell on the class
mr tate did not break it but dug with his hand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists
stephen did not look up
it was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still smarting and weak
he was conscious of failure and of detection of the squalor of his own mind and home and felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar
a short loud laugh from mr tate set the class more at ease
perhaps you didnot know that he said
where asked stephen
mr tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay
here about the creator and the soul
rrm rrm rrm
ah
without a possibility of ever approaching nearer heresy
stephen murmured meant without a possibility of ever reaching
it was a submission and mr tate appeased folded up the essay and passed it across to him saying ah
ever reaching another story
but the class was not so soon appeased
though nobody spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a vague general malignant joy
a few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter along the drumcondra road when he heard a voice cry halt
he turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the dusk
it was heron who had called out and as he marched forward between his two attendants he cleft the air before him with a thin cane in time to their steps
boland his friend marched beside him a large grin on his face while nash came on a few steps behind blowing from the pace and wagging his great red head
as soon as the boys had turned into clonliffe road together they began to speak about books and writers saying what books they were reading and how many books there were in their fathers bookcases at home
stephen listened to them in some wonderment for boland was the dunce and nash the idler of the class
in fact after some talk about their favourite writers nash declared for captain marryat who he said was the greatest writer
fudge said heron
ask dedalus
who is the greatest writer dedalus
stephen noted the mockery in the question and said of prose do you mean
yes
newman i think
is it cardinal newman asked boland
yes answered stephen
the grin broadened on freckled face as he turned to stephen and said and do you like cardinal newman dedalus many say that newman has the best prose style heron said to the other two in explanation of course hes not a poet
and who is the best poet heron asked boland
lord tennyson of course answered heron yes lord tennyson said nash
we have all his poetry at home in a book
at this stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burst out tennyson a poet
why hes only a rhymester get out said heron
everyone knows that tennyson is the greatest poet
and who do you think is the greatest poet asked boland nudging his neighbour
byron of course answered stephen
heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh
what are you laughing at asked stephen
you said heron
byron the greatest poet only a poet for uneducated people
he must be a fine poet said boland
you may keep your mouth shut said stephen turning on him boldly
all you know about poetry is what you wrote up on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft for
boland in fact was said to have written on the slates in the yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home from the college on a pony as tyson was riding into jerusalem he fell and hurt his alec kafoozelum
this thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but heron went on in any case byron was a heretic and immoral too donot care what he was cried stephen hotly
you donot care whether he was a heretic or not said nash
what do you know about it shouted stephen
you never read a line of anything in your life except a trans or boland either know that byron was a bad man said boland
here catch hold of this heretic heron called out
in a moment stephen was a prisoner
tate made you buck up the other day heron went on about the heresy in your essay tell him tomorrow said boland
will you said stephen be afraid to open your lips
afraid
ay
afraid of your life
behave yourself cried heron cutting at legs with his cane
it was the signal for their onset
nash pinioned his arms behind while boland seized a long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter
struggling and kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump stephen was borne back against a barbed wire fence
admit that byron was no good
no
admit
no
admit
no
no
at last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free
his tormentors set off towards road laughing and jeering at him while he half blinded with tears stumbled on clenching his fists madly and sobbing
while he was still repeating the confiteor amid the indulgent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who had tormented him
he had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him
all the descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to him therefore unreal
even that night as he stumbled homewards along road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that suddenwoven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of its soft ripe peel
he remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre
she was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for him to appear
he tried to recall her appearance but could not
he could remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him
he wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in his
then in the dark and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand upon the palm of the other hand scarcely touching it lightly
but the pressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier and suddenly the memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible wave
a boy came towards them running along under the shed
he was excited and breathless
dedalus he cried doyle is in a great bake about you to go in at once and get dressed for the play
hurry up you better coming now said heron to the messenger with a haughty drawl when he wants to
the boy turned to heron and repeated but doyle is in an awful bake
will you tell doyle with my best compliments that i damned his eyes answered heron
well i must go now said stephen who cared little for such points of honour wouldnot said heron damn me if i would no way to send for one of the senior boys
in a bake indeed
i think its quite enough that youre taking a part in his bally old play
this spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately in his rival had not seduced stephen from his habits of quiet obedience
he mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him a sorry anticipation of manhood
the question of honour here raised was like all such questions trivial to him
while his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters urging him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above all things
these voices had now come to be hollowsounding in his ears
when the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her language and tradition
in the profane world as he foresaw a worldly voice would bid him raise up his fathers fallen state by his labours and meanwhile the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get free days for the school
and it was the din of all these hollowsounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantoms
he gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far from them beyond their call alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades
in the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man in shabby blue clothes were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks
the boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips
in the middle of the vestry a young jesuit who was then on a visit to the college stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets
his small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes
as he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of the priests mocking smile there came into memory a saying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to clongowes that you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes
at the same moment he thought he saw a likeness between his fathers mind and that of this smiling welldressed priest and he was aware of some desecration of the priests office or of the vestry itself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease
while his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and make his points clearly
he could hear the band playing the lily of killarney and knew that in a few moments the curtain would go up
he felt no stage fright but the thought of the part he had to play humiliated him
a remembrance of some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks
he saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience and their image at once swept away his scruples leaving his will compact
another nature seemed to have been lent him the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness
for one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boyhood and as he stood in the wings among the other players he shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks and all awry
a few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery acting before the innumerable faces of the void
it surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own
it seemed now to play itself he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts
when the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and through a rift in a side scene saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed the void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups
he left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden
now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure
he hurried onwards as if to overtake it
the doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out
on the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze flickering cheerlessly
he mounted the steps from the garden in haste eager that some prey should not elude him and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors
he pushed onward nervously feigning a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake
when he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the first lamp
in a glance he noted that every figure of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily have to leave a message down in street he said to his father quickly be home after you
without waiting for his fathers questions he ran across the road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill
he hardly knew where he was walking
pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind
he strode down the hill amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and fallen hope and baffled desire
they streamed upwards before his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again
a film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer
a power akin to that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him brought his steps to rest
he stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side
he saw the word lotts on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air
that is horse piss and rotted straw he thought
it is a good odour to breathe
it will calm my heart
my heart is quite calm now
i will go back
stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner of a railway carriage at kingsbridge
he was travelling with his father by the night mail to cork
as the train steamed out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of his first day at clongowes
but he felt no wonder now
he saw the darkening lands slipping away past him the silent telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds the little glimmering stations manned by a few silent sentries flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner
he listened without sympathy to his fathers evocation of cork and of scenes of his youth a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit
stephen heard but could feel no pity
the images of the dead were all strangers to him save that of uncle charles an image which had lately been fading out of memory
he knew however that his fathers property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy
at maryborough he fell asleep
when he awoke the train had passed out of mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat
the cold light of the dawn lay over the country over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages
the terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent country or heard from time to time his fathers deep breath or sudden sleepy movement
the neighbourhood of unseen sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could harm him and he prayed that the day might come quickly
his prayer addressed neither to god nor saint began with a shiver as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the carriage door to his feet and ended in a trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train and silently at intervals of four seconds the telegraphpoles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual bars
this furious music allayed his dread and leaning against the windowledge he let his eyelids close again
they drove in a jingle across cork while it was still early morning and stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the victoria hotel
the bright warm sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hear the din of traffic
his father was standing before the dressingtable examining his hair and face and moustache with great care craning his neck across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the better
while he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent and phrasing tis youth and folly makes young men marry so here my love no longer stay
what canot be cured sure must be injured sure so go to amerikay
my love shes handsome my love shes bony like good whisky when it is new but when tis old and growing cold it fades and dies like the mountain dew
the consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender tremors with which his fathers voice festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of the nights ill humour from brain
he got up quickly to dress and when the song had ended said much prettier than any of your other comeallyous
do you think so asked mr dedalus like it said stephen a pretty old air said mr dedalus twirling the points of his moustache
ah but you should have heard mick lacy sing it
poor mick lacy
he had little turns for it grace notes that he used to put in that i havenot got
that was the boy who could sing a comeallyou if you like
mr dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news
for the most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was mentioned the waiter having in mind the present holder and mr dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather
well i hope they havenot moved the college anyhow said mr dedalus for i want to show it to this youngster of mine
along the mardyke the trees were in bloom
they entered the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle
but their progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every dozen or so paces by some reply of the porters
ah do you tell me so
and is poor pottlebelly dead
yes sir
dead sir
during these halts stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again
by the time they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen to fever
he wondered how his father whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man could be duped by the servile manners of the porter and the lively southern speech which had entertained him all the morning now irritated his ears
they passed into the anatomy theatre where mr dedalus the porter aiding him searched the desks for his initials
stephen remained in the background depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study
on the desk he read the word ftus cut several times in the dark stained wood
the sudden legend startled his blood he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about him and to shrink from their company
a vision of their life which his fathers words had been powerless to evoke sprang up before him out of the word cut in the desk
a broadshouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the letters with a jackknife seriously
other students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork
one jogged his elbow
the big student turned on him frowning
he was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots name was called
he hurried down the steps of the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and peering closely at his fathers initials hid his flushed face
but the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college gate
it shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his own mind
his monstrous reveries came thronging into his memory
they too had sprung up before him suddenly and furiously out of mere words
he had soon given in to them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect wondering always where they came from from what den of monstrous images and always weak and humble towards others restless and sickened of himself when they had swept over him
ay bedad
and theres the groceries sure enough cried mr dedalus
you often heard me speak of the groceries didnot you stephen the time we went down there when our names had been marked a crowd of us harry peard and little jack mountain and bob dyas and maurice moriarty the frenchman and tom ogrady and mick lacy that i told you of this morning and joey corbet and poor little goodhearted johnny keevers of the tantiles
the leaves of the trees along the mardyke were astir and whispering in the sunlight
a team of cricketers passed agile young men in flannels and blazers one of them carrying the long green wicketbag
in a quiet bystreet a german band of five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely messenger boys
a maid in a white cap and apron was watering a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in the warm glare
from another window open to the air came the sound of a piano scale after scale rising into the treble
stephen walked on at his fathers side listening to stories he had heard before hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who had been the companions of his fathers youth
and a faint sickness sighed in his heart
he recalled his own equivocal position in belvedere a free boy a leader afraid of his own authority proud and sensitive and suspicious battling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind
the letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies
the spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness
he could still hear his fathers you kick out for yourself i daresay you will one of these daysremember whatever you do to mix with gentlemen
when i was a young fellow i tell you i enjoyed myself
i mixed with fine decent fellows
everyone of us could do something
one fellow had a good voice another fellow was a good actor another could sing a good comic song another was a good oarsman or a good racket player another could tell a good story and so on
we kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of it either
but we were all gentlemen least i hope we wereand bloody good honest irishmen too the kind of fellows i want you to associate with fellows of the right kidney talking to you as a friend stephen
i donot believe a son should be afraid of his father
no i treat you as your grandfather treated me when i was a young chap
we were more like brothers than father and son never forget the first day he caught me smoking
i was standing at the end of the south terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths
suddenly the governor passed
he didnot say a word or stop even
but the next day sunday we were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and the by simon i didnot know you smoked or something like course i tried to carry it off as best i you want a good smoke he said try one of these cigars
an american captain made me a present of them last night in queenstown
stephen heard his fathers voice break into a laugh which was almost a sob
he was the handsomest man in cork at that time by god he was
the women used to stand to look after him in the street
he heard the sob passing loudly down his fathers throat and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse
the sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark rosy light
his very brain was sick and powerless
he could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops
by his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality
nothing moved him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the infuriated cries within him
he could respond to no earthly or human appeal dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship wearied and dejected by his fathers voice
he could scarcely recognise as his own thoughts and repeated slowly to himself am stephen dedalus
i am walking beside my father whose name is simon dedalus
we are in cork in ireland
cork is a city
our room is in the victoria hotel
victoria and stephen and simon
simon and stephen and victoria
names
the memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim
he tried to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not
he recalled only names
dante parnell clane clongowes
a little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept two brushes in her wardrobe
then he had been sent away from home to a college he had made his first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricketcap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope of being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes
but he had not died then
parnell had died
there had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no procession
he had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun
he had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed
how strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a way not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe
it was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment a little boy in a grey belted suit
his hands were in his sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the knees by elastic bands
on the evening of the day on which the property was sold stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to bar
to the sellers in the market to the barmen and barmaids to the beggars who importuned him for a lob mr dedalus told the same tale that he was an old corkonian that he had been trying for thirty years to get rid of his cork accent up in dublin and that peter pickackafax beside him was his eldest son but that he was only a dublin jackeen
they had set out early in the morning from coffeehouse where mr dedalus cup had rattled noisily against its saucer and stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of his fathers drinking bout of the night before by moving his chair and coughing
one humiliation had succeeded anotherthe false smiles of the market sellers the curvetings and oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted the compliments and encouraging words of his fathers friends
they had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and mr dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness
they had unearthed traces of a cork accent in his speech and made him admit that the lee was a much finer river than the liffey
one of them in order to put his latin to the proof had made him translate short passages from dilectus and asked him whether it was correct to say tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis or tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis another a brisk old man whom mr dedalus called johnny cashman had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were prettier the dublin girls or the cork girls not that way built said mr dedalus
leave him alone a levelheaded thinking boy who doesnot bother his head about that kind of nonsense
then hes not his fathers son said the little old man donot know sure said mr dedalus smiling complacently
your father said the little old man to stephen was the boldest flirt in the city of cork in his day
do you know that
stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into which they had drifted
now donot be putting ideas into his head said mr dedalus
leave him to his maker
yerra sure i wouldnot put any ideas into his head old enough to be his grandfather
and i am a grandfather said the little old man to stephen
do you know that
are you asked stephen
bedad i am said the little old man
i have two bouncing grandchildren out at well
now then
what age do you think i am
and i remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds
that was before you were born
ay or thought of said mr dedalus
bedad i did repeated the little old man
and more than that i can remember even your greatgrandfather old john stephen dedalus and a fierce old fireeater he was
now then a memory for you three generationsfour generations said another of the company
why johnny cashman you must be nearing the century
well tell you the truth said the little old man just twentyseven years of age as old as we feel johnny said mr dedalus
and just finish what you have there and well have another
here tim or tom or whatever your name is give us the same again here
by god i donot feel more than eighteen myself that son of mine there not half my age and a better man than he is any day of the week
draw it mild now dedalus
i think its time for you to take a back seat said the gentleman who had spoken before
no by god asserted mr dedalus sing a tenor song against him or vault a fivebarred gate against him or run with him after the hounds across the country as i did thirty years ago along with the kerry boy and the best man for it
but hell beat you here said the little old man tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it
well i hope hell be as good a man as his father all i can say said mr dedalus
if he is hell do said the little old man
and thanks be to god johnny said mr dedalus that we lived so long and did so little harm
but did so much good simon said the little old man gravely
thanks be to god we lived so long and did so much good
stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past
an abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered him from them
his mind seemed older than theirs it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon upon a younger earth
no life or youth stirred in him as it had stirred in them
he had known neither the pleasure of companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial piety
nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and loveless lust
his childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul capable of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barren shell of the moon
art thou pale for weariness of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth wandering companionless
he repeated to himself the lines of fragment
its alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycles of activity chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the corner of quiet foster place while he and his father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the highland sentry was parading
when they had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter stephen drew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of ireland for thirty and three pounds and these sums the moneys of his exhibition and essay prize were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes and in coin respectively
he bestowed them in his pockets with feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller to whom his father chatted to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in after life
he was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at rest
but the teller still deferred the serving of others to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the best education that money could buy
mr dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling stephen who urged him to come out that they were standing in the house of commons of the old irish parliament
god help us he said piously to think of the men of those times stephen hely hutchinson and flood and henry grattan and charles kendal bushe and the noblemen we have now leaders of the irish people at home and abroad
why by god they wouldnot be seen dead in a tenacre field with them
no stephen old chap sorry to say that they are only as i roved out one fine may morning in the merry month of sweet july
a keen october wind was blowing round the bank
the three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery eyes
stephen looked at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of well thats done said mr dedalus
we had better go to dinner said stephen
where
dinner said mr dedalus
well i suppose we had better what
some place thats not too dear said mrs dedalus
yes
some quiet place
come along said stephen quickly
it doesnot matter about the dearness
he walked on before them with short nervous steps smiling
they tried to keep up with him smiling also at his eagerness
take it easy like a good young fellow said his father not out for the half mile are we
for a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through fingers
great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city
every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre to see ingomar or the lady of lyons
in his coat pockets he carried squares of vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers pocket bulged with masses of silver and copper coins
he bought presents for everyone overhauled his room wrote out resolutions marshalled his books up and down their shelves pored upon all kinds of price lists drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of it held some office opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent
when he could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams
then the season of pleasure came to an end
the pot of pink enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished and illplastered coat
his household returned to its usual way of life
his mother had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money
he too returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fell to pieces
the commonwealth fell the loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desuetude
how foolish his aim had been
he had tried to build a breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up by rules of conduct and active interest and new filial relations the powerful recurrence of the tides within him
useless
from without as from within the water had flowed over his barriers their tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole
he saw clearly too his own futile isolation
he had not gone one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restless shame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother and sister
he felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage fosterchild and fosterbrother
he turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which everything else was idle and alien
he cared little that he was in mortal sin that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood
beside the savage desire within him to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred
he bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes
by day and by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world
a figure that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning her eyes bright with brutish joy
only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot its keen and humiliating sense of transgression
he returned to his wanderings
the veiled autumnal evenings led him from street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet avenues of blackrock
but no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence upon him now
only at times in the pauses of his desire when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to a softer languor the image of mercedes traversed the background of his memory
he saw again the small white house and the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make there standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure
at those moments the soft speeches of claude melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest
a tender premonition touched him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and in spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and now of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him
such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again
the verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to force a passage
his blood was in revolt
he wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and doorways listening eagerly for any sound
he moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast
he wanted to sin with another of his kind to force another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin
he felt some dark presence moving irresistibly upon him from the darkness a presence subtle and murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself
its murmur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in sleep its subtle streams penetrated his being
his hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered the agony of its penetration
he stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited him and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips
it broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious entreaty a cry for an iniquitous abandonment a cry which was but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal
he had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets
from the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers
he walked onward undismayed wondering whether he had strayed into the quarter of the jews
women and girls dressed in long vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house
they were leisurely and perfumed
a trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim
the yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vision against the vapoury sky burning as if before an altar
before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite
he was in another world he had awakened from a slumber of centuries
he stood still in the middle of the roadway his heart clamouring against his bosom in a tumult
a young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face
she said gaily good night willie dear
her room was warm and lightsome
a huge doll sat with her legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed
he tried to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease watching her as she undid her gown noting the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head
as he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and embraced him gaily and gravely
her round arms held him firmly to her and he seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her breast all but burst into hysterical weeping
tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they would not speak
she passed her tinkling hand through his hair calling him a little rascal
give me a kiss she said
his lips would not bend to kiss her
he wanted to be held firmly in her arms to be caressed slowly slowly slowly
in her arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself
but his lips would not bend to kiss her
with a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes
it was too much for him
he closed his eyes surrendering himself to her body and mind conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips
they pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech and between them he felt an unknown and timid pressure darker than the swoon of sin softer than sound or odour
chapter the swift december dusk had come tumbling clownishly after its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food
he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flourfattened sauce
stuff it into you his belly counselled him
it would be a gloomy secret night
after early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels
he would follow a devious course up and down the streets circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner
the whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair
he would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh
yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses stultified only by his desire would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill his ears the drawling jargon of greeting hello bertie any good in your mind
is that you pigeon
number ten
fresh nelly is waiting on you
good night husband
coming in to have a short time
the equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail eyed and starred like a peacocks and when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated began slowly to fold itself together again
the indices appearing and disappearing were eyes opening and closing the eyes opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched
the vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre a distant music accompanying him outward and inward
what music
the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
the stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space
the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
it was his own soul going forth to experience unfolding itself sin by sin spreading abroad the balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself fading slowly quenching its own lights and fires
they were quenched and the cold darkness filled chaos
a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
at his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess
instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them
the chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself
he had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment
his days and works and thoughts could make no atonement for him the fountains of sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul
at most by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace
devotion had gone by the board
what did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction
a certain pride a certain awe withheld him from offering to god even one prayer at night though he knew it was in power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy
his pride in his own sin his loveless awe of god told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the allseeing and allknowing
well now ennis i declare you have a head and so has my stick
do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is
the blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his fellows
towards others he felt neither shame nor fear
on sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded four deep outside the church morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear
their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at
he stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so easily
on the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll the certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the blessed virgin mary
on saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses
the falsehood of his position did not pain him
if at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and confessing before them all his unworthiness to leave the chapel a glance at their faces restrained him
the imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed his barren pride
the glories of mary held his soul captive spikenard and myrrh and frankincense symbolising her royal lineage her emblems the lateflowering plant and lateblossoming tree symbolising the agelong gradual growth of her cultus among men
when it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled voice lulling his conscience to its music
quasi cedrus exaltata sum in libanon et quasi cupressus in monte sion
quasi palma exaltata sum in gades et quasi plantatio rosae in jericho
quasi uliva speciosa in campis et quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta aquam in plateis
sicut cinnamomum et balsamum aromatizans odorem dedi et quasi myrrha electa dedi suavitatem odoris his sin which had covered him from the sight of god had led him nearer to the refuge of sinners
her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight
if ever his soul reentering her dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his bodys lust had spent itself was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star bright and musical telling of heaven and infusing peace it was when her names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words the savour itself of a lewd kiss
that was strange
he tried to think how it could be but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts
the bell rang
the master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out
heron beside stephen began to hum tunelessly
my excellent friend bombados
ennis who had gone to the yard came back saying the boy from the house is coming up for the rector
a tall boy behind stephen rubbed his hands and said game ball
we can scut the whole hour
he wonot be in till after half two
then you can ask him questions on the catechism dedalus
stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying shut up will you make such a bally racket
it was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
the sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state
from the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung forth pride in himself and contempt of others covetousness in using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasures envy of those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious murmuring against the pious gluttonous enjoyment of food the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his longing the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his whole being had sunk
as he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rectors shrewd harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it
if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune
if a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptised
is baptism with a mineral water valid
how comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land
why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
does a tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood of jesus christ or a part only of the body and blood
if the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
here he is
here he is
a boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house
all the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently
the rector entered and took his seat on the dais
a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
he clasped his hands on the desk and said the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honour of saint francis xavier whose feast day is saturday
the retreat will go on from wednesday to friday
on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
if any boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to change
mass will be on saturday morning at nine oclock and general communion for the whole college
saturday will be a free day
but saturday and sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think that monday is a free day also
beware of making that mistake
i think you lawless are likely to make that mistake sir
why sir
a little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rectors grim smile heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
the rector went on gravely you are all familiar with the story of the life of saint francis xavier i suppose the patron of your college
he came of an old and illustrious spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint ignatius
they met in paris where francis xavier was professor of philosophy at the university
this young and brilliant nobleman and man of letters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious founder and you know that he at his own desire was sent by saint ignatius to preach to the indians
he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
he went from country to country in the east from africa to india from india to japan baptising the people
he is said to have baptised as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month
it is said that his right arm had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptised
he wished then to go to china to win still more souls for god but he died of fever on the island of sancian
a great saint saint francis xavier
a great soldier of god
the rector paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him went on he had the faith in him that moves mountains
ten thousand souls won for god in a single month
that is a true conqueror true to the motto of our order ad majorem dei gloriam a saint who has great power in heaven remember power to intercede for us in our grief power to obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls power above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin
a great saint saint francis xavier
a great fisher of souls
he ceased to shake his clasped hands and resting them against his forehead looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes
in the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow heart had withered up like a flower of the desert that feels the simoom coming from afar
remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin for everwords taken my dear little brothers in christ from the book of ecclesiastes seventh chapter fortieth verse
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel
father arnall sat at a table to the left of the altar
he wore about his shoulders a heavy cloak his pale face was drawn and his voice broken with rheum
the figure of his old master so strangely rearisen brought back to mind his life at clongowes the wide playgrounds swarming with boys the square ditch the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where he had dreamed of being buried the firelight on the wall of the infirmary where he lay sick the sorrowful face of brother michael
his soul as these memories came back to him became again a childs soul
we are assembled here today my dear little brothers in christ for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest of saints the apostle of the indies the patron saint also of your college saint francis xavier
year after year for much longer than any of you my dear little boys can remember or than i can remember the boys of this college have met in this very chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their patron saint
time has gone on and brought with it its changes
even in the last few years what changes can most of you not remember
many of the boys who sat in those front benches a few years ago are perhaps now in distant lands in the burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in seminaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or it may be already called by the great god to another life and to the rendering up of their stewardship
and still as the years roll by bringing with them changes for good and bad the memory of the great saint is honoured by the boys of this college who make every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast day set apart by our holy mother the church to transmit to all the ages the name and fame of one of the greatest sons of catholic spain
now what is the meaning of this word retreat and why is it allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who desire to lead before god and in the eyes of men a truly christian life
a retreat my dear boys signifies a withdrawal for a while from the cares of our life the cares of this workaday world in order to examine the state of our conscience to reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand better why we are here in this world
during these few days i intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four last things
they are as you know from your catechism death judgement hell and heaven
we shall try to understand them fully during these few days so that we may derive from the understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls
and remember my dear boys that we have been sent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone to do holy will and to save our immortal souls
all else is worthless
one thing alone is needful the salvation of ones soul
what doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his immortal soul
ah my dear boys believe me there is nothing in this wretched world that can make up for such a loss will ask you therefore my dear boys to put away from your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts whether of study or pleasure or ambition and to give all your attention to the state of your souls
i need hardly remind you that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud unseemly pleasure
the elder boys of course will see that this custom is not infringed and i look especially to the prefects and officers of the sodality of our blessed lady and of the sodality of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstudents
let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint francis with our whole heart and our whole mind blessing will then be upon all your years studies
but above and beyond all let this retreat be one to which you can look back in after years when maybe you are far from this college and among very different surroundings to which you can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to god for having granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a pious honourable zealous christian life
and if as may so happen there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul who has had the unutterable misfortune to lose holy grace and to fall into grievous sin i fervently trust and pray that this retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul
i pray to god through the merits of his zealous servant francis xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on saint day of this year may be a lasting covenant between god and that soul
for just and unjust for saint and sinner alike may this retreat be a memorable one
help me my dear little brothers in christ
help me by your pious attention by your own devotion by your outward demeanour
banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and think only of the last things death judgement hell and heaven
he who remembers these things says ecclesiastes shall not sin for ever
he who remembers the last things will act and think with them always before his eyes
he will live a good life and die a good death believing and knowing that if he has sacrificed much in this earthly life it will be given to him a hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come in the kingdom without enda blessing my dear boys which i wish you from my heart one and all in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
as he walked home with silent companions a thick fog seemed to compass his mind
he waited in stupor of mind till it should lift and reveal what it had hidden
he ate his dinner with surly appetite and when the meal was over and the greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table he rose and went to the window clearing the thick scum from his mouth with his tongue and licking it from his lips
so he had sunk to the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat
this was the end and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind
he pressed his face against the pane of the window and gazed out into the darkening street
forms passed this way and that through the dull light
and that was life
the letters of the name of dublin lay heavily upon his mind pushing one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence
his soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening dusk while the body that was his stood listless and dishonoured gazing out of darkened eyes helpless perturbed and human for a bovine god to stare upon
the next day brought death and judgement stirring his soul slowly from its listless despair
the faint glimmer of fear became a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew death into his soul
he suffered its agony
he felt the deathchill touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart the film of death veiling the eyes the bright centres of the brain extinguished one by one like lamps the last sweat oozing upon the skin the powerlessness of the dying limbs the speech thickening and wandering and failing the heart throbbing faintly and more faintly all but vanquished the breath the poor breath the poor helpless human spirit sobbing and sighing gurgling and rattling in the throat
no help
no help himselfhis body to which he had yielded was dying
into the grave with it
nail it down into a wooden box the corpse
carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings
thrust it out of mens sight into a long hole in the ground into the grave to rot to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats
and while the friends were still standing in tears by the bedside the soul of the sinner was judged
at the last moment of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision of the soul and ere it had time to reflect the body had died and the soul stood terrified before the judgement seat
god who had long been merciful would then be just
he had long been patient pleading with the sinful soul giving it time to repent sparing it yet awhile
but that time had gone
time was to sin and to enjoy time was to scoff at god and at the warnings of his holy church time was to defy his majesty to disobey his commands to hoodwink ones fellow men to commit sin after sin and to hide ones corruption from the sight of men
but that time was over
now it was turn and he was not to be hoodwinked or deceived
every sin would then come forth from its lurkingplace the most rebellious against the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt nature the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity
what did it avail then to have been a great emperor a great general a marvellous inventor the most learned of the learned
all were as one before the judgement seat of god
he would reward the good and punish the wicked
one single instant was enough for the trial of a mans soul
one single instant after the bodys death the soul had been weighed in the balance
the particular judgement was over and the soul had passed to the abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled howling into hell
nor was that all justice had still to be vindicated before men after the particular there still remained the general judgement
the last day had come
doomsday was at hand
the stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken
the sun the great luminary of the universe had become as sackcloth of hair
the moon was bloodred
the firmament was as a scroll rolled away
the archangel michael the prince of the heavenly host appeared glorious and terrible against the sky
with one foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time
the three blasts of the angel filled all the universe
time is time was but time shall be no more
at the last blast the souls of universal humanity throng towards the valley of jehosaphat rich and poor gentle and simple wise and foolish good and wicked
the soul of every human being that has ever existed the souls of all those who shall yet be born all the sons and daughters of adam all are assembled on that supreme day
and lo the supreme judge is coming
no longer the lowly lamb of god no longer the meek jesus of nazareth no longer the man of sorrows no longer the good shepherd he is seen now coming upon the clouds in great power and majesty attended by nine choirs of angels angels and archangels principalities powers and virtues thrones and dominations cherubim and seraphim god omnipotent god everlasting
he speaks and his voice is heard even at the farthest limits of space even in the bottomless abyss
supreme judge from his sentence there will be and can be no appeal
he calls the just to his side bidding them enter into the kingdom the eternity of bliss prepared for them
the unjust he casts from him crying in his offended majesty depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels what agony then for the miserable sinners
friend is torn apart from friend children are torn from their parents husbands from their wives
the poor sinner holds out his arms to those who were dear to him in this earthly world to those whose simple piety perhaps he made a mock of to those who counselled him and tried to lead him on the right path to a kind brother to a loving sister to the mother and father who loved him so dearly
but it is too late the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil character you hypocrites you whited sepulchres you who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul within is a foul swamp of sin how will it fare with you in that terrible day
and this day will come shall come must come the day of death and the day of judgement
it is appointed unto man to die and after death the judgement
death is certain
the time and manner are uncertain whether from long disease or from some unexpected accident the son of god cometh at an hour when you little expect him
be therefore ready every moment seeing that you may die at any moment
death is the end of us all
death and judgement brought into the world by the sin of our first parents are the dark portals that close our earthly existence the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen portals through which every soul must pass alone unaided save by its good works without friend or brother or parent or master to help it alone and trembling
let that thought be ever before our minds and then we cannot sin
death a cause of terror to the sinner is a blessed moment for him who has walked in the right path fulfilling the duties of his station in life attending to his morning and evening prayers approaching the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and merciful works
for the pious and believing catholic for the just man death is no cause of terror
was it not addison the great english writer who when on his deathbed sent for the wicked young earl of warwick to let him see how a christian can meet his end
he it is and he alone the pious and believing christian who can say in his heart grave where is thy victory death where is thy sting
every word of it was for him
against his sin foul and secret the whole wrath of god was aimed
the preachers knife had probed deeply into his disclosed conscience and he felt now that his soul was festering in sin
yes the preacher was right turn had come
like a beast in its lair his soul had lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angels trumpet had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light
the words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant his presumptuous peace
the wind of the last day blew through his mind his sins the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination fled before the hurricane squeaking like mice in their terror and huddled under a mane of hair
as he crossed the square walking homeward the light laughter of a girl reached his burning ear
the frail gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast and not daring to lift his eyes he turned aside and gazed as he walked into the shadow of the tangled shrubs
shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being
the image of emma appeared before him and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart
if she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence
was that boyish love
was that chivalry
was that poetry
the sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils
the sootcoated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful wantonness he lay for hours sinning in thought and deed his monstrous dreams peopled by apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or beneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly
mad
mad
was it possible he had done these things
a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain
when the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to raise his soul from its abject powerlessness
god and the blessed virgin were too far from him god was too great and stern and the blessed virgin too pure and holy
but he imagined that he stood near emma in a wide land and humbly and in tears bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve
in the wide land under a tender lucid evening sky a cloud drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven they stood together children that had erred
their error had offended deeply majesty though it was the error of two children but it had not offended her whose beauty is not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which is its emblem bright and musical
the eyes were not offended which she turned upon him nor reproachful
she placed their hands together hand in hand and said speaking to their hearts take hands stephen and emma
it is a beautiful evening now in heaven
you have erred but you are always my children
it is one heart that loves another heart
take hands together my dear children and you will be happy together and your hearts will love each other
the chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered through the lowered blinds and through the fissure between the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of angels
rain was falling on the chapel on the garden on the college
it would rain for ever noiselessly
the water would rise inch by inch covering the grass and shrubs covering the trees and houses covering the monuments and the mountain tops
all life would be choked off noiselessly birds men elephants pigs children noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the wreckage of the world
forty days and forty nights the rain would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth
it might be
why not
hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without any limitswords taken my dear little brothers in christ jesus from the book of isaias fifth chapter fourteenth verse
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
the preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within his soutane and having considered its dial for a moment in silence placed it silently before him on the table
he began to speak in a quiet tone
adam and eve my dear boys were as you know our first parents and you will remember that they were created by god in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again
lucifer we are told was a son of the morning a radiant and mighty angel yet he fell he fell and there fell with him a third part of the host of heaven he fell and was hurled with his rebellious angels into hell
what his sin was we cannot say
theologians consider that it was the sin of pride the sinful thought conceived in an instant non serviam i will not serve that instant was his ruin
he offended the majesty of god by the sinful thought of one instant and god cast him out of heaven into hell for ever
adam and eve were then created by god and placed in eden in the plain of damascus that lovely garden resplendent with sunlight and colour teeming with luxuriant vegetation
the fruitful earth gave them her bounty beasts and birds were their willing servants they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to disease and poverty and death all that a great and generous god could do for them was done
but there was one condition imposed on them by god obedience to his word
they were not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree
alas my dear little boys they too fell
the devil once a shining angel a son of the morning now a foul fiend came in the shape of a serpent the subtlest of all the beasts of the field
he envied them
he the fallen great one could not bear to think that man a being of clay should possess the inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever
he came to the woman the weaker vessel and poured the poison of his eloquence into her ear promising the blasphemy of that if she and adam ate of the forbidden fruit they would become as gods nay as god himself
eve yielded to the wiles of the arch tempter
she ate the apple and gave it also to adam who had not the moral courage to resist her
the poison tongue of satan had done its work
they fell
and then the voice of god was heard in that garden calling his creature man to account and michael prince of the heavenly host with a sword of flame in his hand appeared before the guilty pair and drove them forth from eden into the world the world of sickness and striving of cruelty and disappointment of labour and hardship to earn their bread in the sweat of their brow
but even then how merciful was god
he took pity on our poor degraded parents and promised that in the fullness of time he would send down from heaven one who would redeem them make them once more children of god and heirs to the kingdom of heaven and that one that redeemer of fallen man was to be only begotten son the second person of the most blessed trinity the eternal word
he came
he was born of a virgin pure mary the virgin mother
he was born in a poor cowhouse in judea and lived as a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of his mission had come
and then filled with love for men he went forth and called to men to hear the new gospel
did they listen
yes they listened but would not hear
he was seized and bound like a common criminal mocked at as a fool set aside to give place to a public robber scourged with five thousand lashes crowned with a crown of thorns hustled through the streets by the jewish rabble and the roman soldiery stripped of his garments and hanged upon a gibbet and his side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body of our lord water and blood issued continually
yet even then in that hour of supreme agony our merciful redeemer had pity for mankind
yet even there on the hill of calvary he founded the holy catholic church against which it is promised the gates of hell shall not prevail
he founded it upon the rock of ages and endowed it with his grace with sacraments and sacrifice and promised that if men would obey the word of his church they would still enter into eternal life but if after all that had been done for them they still persisted in their wickedness there remained for them an eternity of torment hell
the preachers voice sank
he paused joined his palms for an instant parted them
then he resumed now let us try for a moment to realise as far as we can the nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an offended god has called into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners
hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling prison an abode of demons and lost souls filled with fire and smoke
the straitness of this prison house is expressly designed by god to punish those who refused to be bound by his laws
in earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of movement were it only within the four walls of his cell or in the gloomy yard of his prison
not so in hell
there by reason of the great number of the damned the prisoners are heaped together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be four thousand miles thick and the damned are so utterly bound and helpless that as a blessed saint saint anselm writes in his book on similitudes they are not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it
they lie in exterior darkness
for remember the fire of hell gives forth no light
as at the command of god the fire of the babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so at the command of god the fire of hell while retaining the intensity of its heat burns eternally in darkness
it is a neverending storm of darkness dark flames and dark smoke of burning brimstone amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air
of all the plagues with which the land of the pharaohs were smitten one plague alone that of darkness was called horrible
what name then shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity
the horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful stench
all the filth of the world all the offal and scum of the world we are told shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world
the brimstone too which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that as saint bonaventure says one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world
the very air of this world that pure element becomes foul and unbreathable when it has been long enclosed
consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell
imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave a jellylike mass of liquid corruption
imagine such a corpse a prey to flames devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition
and then imagine this sickening stench multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the reeking darkness a huge and rotting human fungus
imagine all this and you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell
but this stench is not horrible though it is the greatest physical torment to which the damned are subjected
the torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has ever subjected his fellow creatures
place your finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire
but our earthly fire was created by god for the benefit of man to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was created by god to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner
our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical preparations to check or frustrate its action
but the sulphurous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeakable fury
moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its duration but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it rages for ever
our earthly fire again no matter how fierce or widespread it may be is always of a limited extent but the lake of fire in hell is boundless shoreless and bottomless
it is on record that the devil himself when asked the question by a certain soldier was obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant like a piece of wax
and this terrible fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself the boundless fire raging in its very vitals how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings
the blood seethes and boils in the veins the brains are boiling in the skull the heart in the breast glowing and bursting the bowels a redhot mass of burning pulp the tender eyes flaming like molten balls
and yet what i have said as to the strength and quality and boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its intensity an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike
it is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of god working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine vengeance
as the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the flesh
every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of the soul therewith the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness the nose with noisome odours the ears with yells and howls and execrations the taste with foul matter leprous corruption nameless suffocating filth the touch with redhot goads and spikes with cruel tongues of flame
and through the several torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the omnipotent god and fanned into everlasting and everincreasing fury by the breath of the anger of the godhead
consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increased by the company of the damned themselves
evil company on earth is so noxious that the plants as if by instinct withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly or hurtful to them
in hell all laws are overturnedthere is no thought of family or country of ties of relationships
the damned howl and scream at one another their torture and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like themselves
all sense of humanity is forgotten
the yells of the suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss
the mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against god and of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those souls which were their accomplices in sin
in olden times it was the custom to punish the parricide the man who had raised his murderous hand against his father by casting him into the depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock a monkey and a serpent
the intention of those lawgivers who framed such a law which seems cruel in our times was to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beasts
but what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them in sin those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds those whose immodest suggestions led them on to sin those whose eyes tempted and allured them from the path of virtue
they turn upon those accomplices and upbraid them and curse them
but they are helpless and hopeless it is too late now for repentance
last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned souls tempters and tempted alike of the company of the devils
these devils will afflict the damned in two ways by their presence and by their reproaches
we can have no idea of how horrible these devils are
saint catherine of siena once saw a devil and she has written that rather than look again for one single instant on such a frightful monster she would prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals
these devils who were once beautiful angels have become as hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful
they mock and jeer at the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin
it is they the foul demons who are made in hell the voices of conscience
why did you sin
why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends
why did you turn aside from your pious practices and good works
why did you not shun the occasions of sin
why did you not leave that evil companion
why did you not give up that lewd habit that impure habit
why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor
why did you not even after you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth or the hundredth time repent of your evil ways and turn to god who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of your sins
now the time for repentance has gone by
time is time was but time shall be no more
time was to sin in secrecy to indulge in that sloth and pride to covet the unlawful to yield to the promptings of your lower nature to live like the beasts of the field nay worse than the beasts of the field for they at least are but brutes and have no reason to guide them time was but time shall be no more
god spoke to you by so many voices but you would not hear
you would not crush out that pride and anger in your heart you would not restore those illgotten goods you would not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to your religious duties you would not abandon those wicked companions you would not avoid those dangerous temptations
such is the language of those fiendish tormentors words of taunting and of reproach of hatred and of disgust
of disgust yes
for even they the very devils when they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such angelical natures a rebellion of the intellect and they even they the foul devils must turn away revolted and disgusted from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the holy ghost defiles and pollutes himself my dear little brothers in christ may it never be our lot to hear that language
may it never be our lot i say
in the last day of terrible reckoning i pray fervently to god that not a single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be found among those miserable beings whom the great judge shall command to depart for ever from his sight that not one of us may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of rejection depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels he came down the aisle of the chapel his legs shaking and the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched by ghostly fingers
he passed up the staircase and into the corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and waterproofs hung like gibbeted malefactors headless and dripping and shapeless
and at every step he feared that he had already died that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his body that he was plunging headlong through space
he could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at his desk opening one of his books at random and poring over it
every word for him
it was true
god was almighty
god could call him now call him as he sat at his desk before he had time to be conscious of the summons
god had called him
yes
what
yes
his flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of the ravenous tongues of flames dried up as it felt about it the swirl of stifling air
he had died
yes
he was judged
a wave of fire swept through his body the first
again a wave
his brain began to glow
another
his brain was simmering and bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull
flames burst forth from his skull like a corolla shrieking like voices hell
hell
hell
hell
hell
voices spoke near him on hell suppose he rubbed it into you well
you bet he did
he put us all into a blue funk what you fellows want and plenty of it to make you work
he leaned back weakly in his desk
he had not died
god had spared him still
he was still in the familiar world of the school
mr tate and vincent heron stood at the window talking jesting gazing out at the bleak rain moving their heads wish it would clear up
i had arranged to go for a spin on the bike with some fellows out by malahide
but the roads must be kneedeep
it might clear up sir
the voices that he knew so well the common words the quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other boys munched their lunches tranquilly lulled his aching soul
there was still time
mary refuge of sinners intercede for him
virgin undefiled save him from the gulf of death
the english lesson began with the hearing of the history
royal persons favourites intriguers bishops passed like mute phantoms behind their veil of names
all had died all had been judged
what did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul
at last he had understood and human life lay around him a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in brotherhood their dead sleeping under quiet mounds
the elbow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition
his soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace no longer able to suffer the pain of dread and sending forth as he sank a faint prayer
ah yes he would still be spared he would repent in his heart and be forgiven and then those above those in heaven would see what he would do to make up for the past a whole life every hour of life
only wait
all god
all all
a messenger came to the door to say that confessions were being heard in the chapel
four boys left the room and he heard others passing down the corridor
a tremulous chill blew round his heart no stronger than a little wind and yet listening and suffering silently he seemed to have laid an ear against the muscle of his own heart feeling it close and quail listening to the flutter of its ventricles
no escape
he had to confess to speak out in words what he had done and thought sin after sin
how
how
father the thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender flesh confession
but not there in the chapel of the college
he would confess all every sin of deed and thought sincerely but not there among his school companions
far away from there in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame and he besought god humbly not to be offended with him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapel and in utter abjection of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts about him
time passed
he sat again in the front bench of the chapel
the daylight without was already failing and as it fell slowly through the dull red blinds it seemed that the sun of the last day was going down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgement am cast away from the sight of thine eyes words taken my dear little brothers in christ from the book of psalms thirtieth chapter twentythird verse
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
the preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone
his face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand forming a frail cage by the union of their tips
this morning we endeavoured in our reflection upon hell to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises the composition of place
we endeavoured that is to imagine with the senses of the mind in our imagination the material character of that awful place and of the physical torments which all who are in hell endure
this evening we shall consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments of hell
sin remember is a twofold enormity
it is a base consent to the promptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts to that which is gross and beastlike and it is also a turning away from the counsel of our higher nature from all that is pure and holy from the holy god himself
for this reason mortal sin is punished in hell by two different forms of punishment physical and spiritual
now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain of loss so great in fact that in itself it is a torment greater than all the others
saint thomas the greatest doctor of the church the angelic doctor as he is called says that the worst damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately turned away from the goodness of god
god remember is a being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful
in this life we have not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell for their greater torment have a full understanding of that which they have lost and understand that they have lost it through their own sins and have lost it for ever
at the very instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and the soul at once flies towards god as towards the centre of her existence
remember my dear little boys our souls long to be with god
we come from god we live by god we belong to god we are his inalienably his
god loves with a divine love every human soul and every human soul lives in that love
how could it be otherwise
every breath that we draw every thought of our brain every instant of life proceeds from inexhaustible goodness
and if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child for a man to be exiled from hearth and home for friend to be sundered from friend think what pain what anguish it must be for the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely good and loving creator who has called that soul into existence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with an immeasurable love
this then to be separated for ever from its greatest good from god and to feel the anguish of that separation knowing full well that it is unchangeable this is the greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing pna damni the pain of loss
the second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in hell is the pain of conscience
just as in dead bodies worms are engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin the sting of conscience the worm as pope innocent the third calls it of the triple sting
the first sting inflicted by this cruel worm will be the memory of past pleasures what a dreadful memory will that be
in the lake of alldevouring flame the proud king will remember the pomps of his court the wise but wicked man his libraries and instruments of research the lover of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous feasts his dishes prepared with such delicacy his choice wines the miser will remember his hoard of gold the robber his illgotten wealth the angry and revengeful and merciless murderers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures in which they delighted
they will remember all this and loathe themselves and their sins
for how miserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for ages and ages
how they will rage and fume to think that they have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth for a few pieces of metal for vain honours for bodily comforts for a tingling of the nerves
they will repent indeed and this is the second sting of the worm of conscience a late and fruitless sorrow for sins committed
divine justice insists that the understanding of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which they were guilty and moreover as saint augustine points out god will impart to them his own knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of god himself
they will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which they neglected
this is the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm of conscience
the conscience will say you had time and opportunity to repent and would not
you were brought up religiously by your parents
you had the sacraments and grace and indulgences of the church to aid you
you had the minister of god to preach to you to call you back when you had strayed to forgive you your sins no matter how many how abominable if only you had confessed and repented
no
you would not
you flouted the ministers of holy religion you turned your back on the confessional you wallowed deeper and deeper in the mire of sin
god appealed to you threatened you entreated you to return to him what shame what misery
the ruler of the universe entreated you a creature of clay to love him who made you and to keep his law
no
you would not
and now though you were to flood all hell with your tears if you could still weep all that sea of repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for you
you implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to repent in vain
that time is gone gone for ever
such is the threefold sting of conscience the viper which gnaws the very hearts core of the wretches in hell so that filled with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them in eternity and even revile and curse the supreme being whose goodness and patience they scorned and slighted but whose justice and power they cannot evade
the next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is the pain of extension
man in this earthly life though he be capable of many evils is not capable of them all at once inasmuch as one evil corrects and counteracts another just as one poison frequently corrects another
in hell on the contrary one torment instead of counteracting another lends it still greater force and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering
just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every spiritual faculty the fancy with horrible images the sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage the mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even than the exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison
the malice impotent though it be which possesses these demon souls is an evil of boundless extension of limitless duration a frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred god bears to it
opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it we have the pain of intensity
hell is the centre of evils and as you know things are more intense at their centres than at their remotest points
there are no contraries or admixtures of any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell
nay things which are good in themselves become evil in hell
company elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted will be there a continual torment knowledge so much longed for as the chief good of the intellect will there be hated worse than ignorance light so much coveted by all creatures from the lord of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest will be loathed intensely
in this life our sorrows are either not very long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight
but in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit for while they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of continual variety each pain so to speak taking fire from another and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer flame
nor can nature escape from these intense and various tortures by succumbing to them for the soul is sustained and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater
boundless extension of torment incredible intensity of suffering unceasing variety of torturethis is what the divine majesty so outraged by sinners demands this is what the holiness of heaven slighted and set aside for the lustful and low pleasures of the corrupt flesh requires this is what the blood of the innocent lamb of god shed for the redemption of sinners trampled upon by the vilest of the vile insists upon
last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful place is the eternity of hell
eternity dread and dire word
eternity
what mind of man can understand it
and remember it is an eternity of pain
even though the pains of hell were not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as they are destined to last for ever
but while they are everlasting they are at the same time as you know intolerably intense unbearably extensive
to bear even the sting of an insect for all eternity would be a dreadful torment
what must it be then to bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever
for ever
for all eternity
not for a year or for an age but for ever
try to imagine the awful meaning of this
you have often seen the sand on the seashore
how fine are its tiny grains
and how many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful which a child grasps in its play
now imagine a mountain of that sand a million miles high reaching from the earth to the farthest heavens and a million miles broad extending to remotest space and a million miles in thickness and imagine such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multiplied as often as there are leaves in the forest drops of water in the mighty ocean feathers on birds scales on fish hairs on animals atoms in the vast expanse of the air and imagine that at the end of every million years a little bird came to that mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand
how many millions upon millions of centuries would pass before that bird had carried away even a square foot of that mountain how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried away all
yet at the end of that immense stretch of time not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended
at the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would have scarcely begun
and if that mountain rose again after it had been all carried away and if the bird came again and carried it all away again grain by grain and if it so rose and sank as many times as there are stars in the sky atoms in the air drops of water in the sea leaves on the trees feathers upon birds scales upon fish hairs upon animals at the end of all those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to have ended even then at the end of such a period after that eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain reel dizzily eternity would scarcely have begun holy saint one of our own fathers i believe it was was once vouchsafed a vision of hell
it seemed to him that he stood in the midst of a great hall dark and silent save for the ticking of a great clock
the ticking went on unceasingly and it seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the ceaseless repetition of the words ever never ever never
ever to be in hell never to be in heaven ever to be shut off from the presence of god never to enjoy the beatific vision ever to be eaten with flames gnawed by vermin goaded with burning spikes never to be free from those pains ever to have the conscience upbraid one the memory enrage the mind filled with darkness and despair never to escape ever to curse and revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of their dupes never to behold the shining raiment of the blessed spirits ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to god for an instant a single instant of respite from such awful agony never to receive even for an instant pardon ever to suffer never to enjoy ever to be damned never to be saved ever never ever never what a dreadful punishment
an eternity of endless agony of endless bodily and spiritual torment without one ray of hope without one moment of cessation of agony limitless in intensity of torment infinitely varied of torture that sustains eternally that which it eternally devours of anguish that everlastingly preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh an eternity every instant of which is itself an eternity of woe
such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and a just god
yes a just god
men reasoning always as men are astonished that god should mete out an everlasting and infinite punishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin
they reason thus because blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh and the darkness of human understanding they are unable to comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin
they reason thus because they are unable to comprehend that even venial sin is of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent creator could end all the evil and misery in the world the wars the diseases the robberies the crimes the deaths the murders on condition that he allowed a single venial sin to pass unpunished a single venial sin a lie an angry look a moment of wilful sloth he the great omnipotent god could not do so because sin be it in thought or deed is a transgression of his law and god would not be god if he did not punish the transgressor sin an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect made lucifer and a third part of the cohort of angels fall from their glory
a sin an instant of folly and weakness drove adam and eve out of eden and brought death and suffering into the world
to retrieve the consequences of that sin the only begotten son of god came down to earth lived and suffered and died a most painful death hanging for three hours on the cross my dear little brethren in christ jesus will we then offend that good redeemer and provoke his anger
will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse
will we spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love
will we too like the cruel jews and the brutal soldiers mock that gentle and compassionate saviour who trod alone for our sake the awful winepress of sorrow
every word of sin is a wound in his tender side
every sinful act is a thorn piercing his head
every impure thought deliberately yielded to is a keen lance transfixing that sacred and loving heart
no no
it is impossible for any human being to do that which offends so deeply the divine majesty that which is punished by an eternity of agony that which crucifies again the son of god and makes a mockery of him pray to god that my poor words may have availed today to confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace to strengthen the wavering to lead back to the state of grace the poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you
i pray to god and do you pray with me that we may repent of our sins
i will ask you now all of you to repeat after me the act of contrition kneeling here in this humble chapel in the presence of god
he is there in the tabernacle burning with love for mankind ready to comfort the afflicted
be not afraid
no matter how many or how foul the sins if you only repent of them they will be forgiven you
let no worldly shame hold you back
god is still the merciful lord who wishes not the eternal death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and live
he calls you to him
you are his
he made you out of nothing
he loved you as only a god can love
his arms are open to receive you even though you have sinned against him
come to him poor sinner poor vain and erring sinner
now is the acceptable time
now is the hour
the priest rose and turning towards the altar knelt upon the step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom
he waited till all in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still
then raising his head he repeated the act of contrition phrase by phrase with fervour
the boys answered him phrase by phrase
stephen his tongue cleaving to his palate bowed his head praying with his heart my god my god am heartily sorry am heartily sorry for having offended thee for having offended thee and i detest my sins and i detest my sins above every other evil above every other evil because they displease thee my god because they displease thee my god who art so deserving who art so deserving of all my love of all my love and i firmly purpose and i firmly purpose by thy holy grace by thy holy grace never more to offend thee never more to offend thee and to amend my life and to amend my life he went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone with his soul and at every step his soul seemed to sigh at every step his soul mounted with his feet sighing in the ascent through a region of viscid gloom
he halted on the landing before the door and then grasping the porcelain knob opened the door quickly
he waited in fear his soul pining within him praying silently that death might not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold that the fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over him
he waited still at the threshold as at the entrance to some dark cave
faces were there eyes they waited and watched
we knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of course perfectly faces waited and watched murmurous voices filled the dark shell of the cave
he feared intensely in spirit and in flesh but raising his head bravely he strode into the room firmly
a doorway a room the same room same window
he told himself calmly that those words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark
he told himself that it was simply his room with the door open
he closed the door and walking swiftly to the bed knelt beside it and covered his face with his hands
his hands were cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill
bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset him routing his thoughts
why was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers
to be alone with his soul to examine his conscience to meet his sins face to face to recall their times and manners and circumstances to weep over them
he could not weep
he could not summon them to his memory
he felt only an ache of soul and body his whole being memory will understanding flesh benumbed and weary
that was the work of devils to scatter his thoughts and overcloud his conscience assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and sincorrupted flesh and praying god timidly to forgive him his weakness he crawled up on to the bed and wrapping the blankets closely about him covered his face again with his hands
he had sinned
he had sinned so deeply against heaven and before god that he was not worthy to be called child
could it be that he stephen dedalus had done those things
his conscience sighed in answer
yes he had done them secretly filthily time after time and hardened in sinful impenitence he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of corruption
how came it that god had not struck him dead
the leprous company of his sins closed about him breathing upon him bending over him from all sides
he strove to forget them in an act of prayer huddling his limbs closer together and binding down his eyelids but the senses of his soul would not be bound and though his eyes were shut fast he saw the places where he had sinned and though his ears were tightly covered he heard
he desired with all his will not to hear or see
he desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and until the senses of his soul closed
they closed for an instant and then opened
he saw
a field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches
thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots and coils of solid excrement
a faint marshlight struggling upwards from all the ordure through the bristling greygreen weeds
an evil smell faint and foul as the light curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the stale crusted dung
creatures were in the field one three six creatures were moving in the field hither and thither
goatish creatures with human faces hornybrowed lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber
the malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes as they moved hither and thither trailing their long tails behind them
a rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces
one was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the tufted weeds
soft language issued from their spittleless lips as they swished in slow circles round and round the field winding hither and thither through the weeds dragging their long tails amid the rattling canisters
they moved in slow circles circling closer and closer to enclose to enclose soft language issuing from their lips their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite thrusting upwards their terrific faces
help
he flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck
that was his hell
god had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his sins stinking bestial malignant a hell of lecherous goatish fiends
for him
for him
he sprang from the bed the reeking odour pouring down his throat clogging and revolting his entrails
air
the air of heaven
he stumbled towards the window groaning and almost fainting with sickness
at the washstand a convulsion seized him within and clasping his cold forehead wildly he vomited profusely in agony
when the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window and lifting the sash sat in a corner of the embrasure and leaned his elbow upon the sill
the rain had drawn off and amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze
heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to breathe as in a thicket drenched with showers and amid peace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made a covenant with his heart
he prayed he once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but we sinned and then he could not safely visit us but with a shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for he was god
so he came himself in weakness not in power and he sent thee a creature in his stead with a creatures comeliness and lustre suited to our state
and now thy very face and form dear mother speak to us of the eternal not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which is thy emblem bright and musical breathing purity telling of heaven and infusing peace harbringer of day light of the pilgrim
lead us still as thou hast led
in the dark night across the bleak wilderness guide us on to our lord jesus guide us home his eyes were dimmed with tears and looking humbly up to heaven he wept for the innocence he had lost
when evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed behind him made ache again his conscience lulled by prayer and tears
confess
confess
it was not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a prayer
he had to kneel before the minister of the holy ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly and repentantly
before he heard again the footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as it opened to let him in before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he would have knelt and confessed
it was quite simple
the ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly through the dark streets
there were so many flagstones on the footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so many cities in the world
yet eternity had no end
he was in mortal sin
even once was a mortal sin
it could happen in an instant
but how so quickly
by seeing or by thinking of seeing
the eyes see the thing without having wished first to see
then in an instant it happens
but does that part of the body understand or what
the serpent the most subtle beast of the field
it must understand when it desires in one instant and then prolongs its own desire instant after instant sinfully
it feels and understands and desires
what a horrible thing
who made it to be like that a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially
was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul
his soul sickened at the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust why was that so why
he cowered in the shadow of the thought abasing himself in the awe of god who had made all things and all men
madness
who could think such a thought
and cowering in darkness and abject he prayed mutely to his guardian angel to drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to his brain
the whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through his own body
confess
he had to confess every sin
how could he utter in words to the priest what he had done
must must
or how could he explain without dying of shame
or how could he have done such things without shame
a madman
confess he would indeed to be free and sinless again
perhaps the priest would know dear god
he walked on and on through illlit streets fearing to stand still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from what awaited him fearing to arrive at that towards which he still turned with longing
how beautiful must be a soul in the state of grace when god looked upon it with love
frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets
their dank hair hung trailed over their brows
they were not beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire
but their souls were seen by god and if their souls were in a state of grace they were radiant to see and god loved them seeing them
a wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of how he had fallen to feel that those souls were dearer to god than his
the wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom favour shone now more and now less stars now brighter and now dimmer sustained and failing
and the glimmering souls passed away sustained and failing merged in a moving breath
one soul was lost a tiny soul his
it flickered once and went out forgotten lost
the end black cold void waste
consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over a vast tract of time unlit unfelt unlived
the squalid scene composed itself around him the common accents the burning gasjets in the shops odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust moving men and women
an old woman was about to cross the street an oilcan in her hand
he bent down and asked her was there a chapel near chapel sir
yes sir
church street chapel
church
she shifted the can to her other hand and directed him and as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe of shawl he bent lower towards her saddened and soothed by her voice
thank you
you are quite welcome sir
the candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave
bearded workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through a side door the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and words
a few of the faithful still lingered praying before one of the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals
he approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the church
the board on which he knelt was narrow and worn and those who knelt near him were humble followers of jesus
jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of a carpenter cutting boards and planing them and had first spoken of the kingdom of god to poor fishermen teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart
he bowed his head upon his hands bidding his heart be meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs
he prayed beside them but it was hard
his soul was foul with sin and he dared not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom jesus in the mysterious ways of god had called first to his side the carpenters the fishermen poor and simple people following a lowly trade handling and shaping the wood of trees mending their nets with patience
a tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred and at the last moment glancing up swiftly he saw a long grey beard and the brown habit of a capuchin
the priest entered the box and was hidden
two penitents rose and entered the confessional at either side
the wooden slide was drawn back and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence
his blood began to murmur in his veins murmuring like a sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom
little flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly alighting on the houses of men
they stirred waking from sleep troubled by the heated air
the slide was shot back
the penitent emerged from the side of the box
the farther side was drawn
a woman entered quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt
the faint murmur began again
he could still leave the chapel
he could stand up put one foot before the other and walk out softly and then run run run swiftly through the dark streets
he could still escape from the shame
had it been any terrible crime but that one sin
had it been murder
little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points shameful thoughts shameful words shameful acts
shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually
to say it in words
his soul stifling and helpless would cease to be
the slide was shot back
a penitent emerged from the farther side of the box
the near slide was drawn
a penitent entered where the other penitent had come out
a soft whispering noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box
it was the woman soft whispering cloudlets soft whispering vapour whispering and vanishing
he beat his breast with his fist humbly secretly under cover of the wooden armrest
he would be at one with others and with god
he would love his neighbour
he would love god who had made and loved him
he would kneel and pray with others and be happy
god would look down on him and on them and would love them all
it was easy to be good yoke was sweet and light
it was better never to have sinned to have remained always a child for god loved little children and suffered them to come to him
it was a terrible and a sad thing to sin
but god was merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry
how true that was
that was indeed goodness
the slide was shot to suddenly
the penitent came out
he was next
he stood up in terror and walked blindly into the box
at last it had come
he knelt in the silent gloom and raised his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him
god could see that he was sorry
he would tell all his sins
his confession would be long long
everybody in the chapel would know then what a sinner he had been
let them know
it was true
but god had promised to forgive him if he was sorry
he was sorry
he clasped his hands and raised them towards the white form praying with his darkened eyes praying with all his trembling body swaying his head to and fro like a lost creature praying with whimpering lips
sorry
sorry sorry
the slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast
the face of an old priest was at the grating averted from him leaning upon a hand
he made the sign of the cross and prayed of the priest to bless him for he had sinned
then bowing his head he repeated the confiteor in fright
at the words my most grievous fault he ceased breathless
how long is it since your last confession my child long time father month my child
longer father
three months my child
longer father
six months
eight months father
he had begun
the priest asked and what do you remember since that time
he began to confess his sins masses missed prayers not said lies
anything else my child
sins of anger envy of others gluttony vanity disobedience
anything else my child
there was no help
he murmured committed sins of impurity father
the priest did not turn his head
with yourself my child
and with others
with women my child
yes father
were they married women my child
he did not know
his sins trickled from his lips one by one trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing like a sore a squalid stream of vice
the last sins oozed forth sluggish filthy
there was no more to tell
he bowed his head overcome
the priest was silent
then he asked how old are you my child
sixteen father
the priest passed his hand several times over his face
then resting his forehead against his hand he leaned towards the grating and with eyes still averted spoke slowly
his voice was weary and old
you are very young my child he said and let me implore of you to give up that sin
it is a terrible sin
it kills the body and it kills the soul
it is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes
give it up my child for sake
it is dishonourable and unmanly
you cannot know where that wretched habit will lead you or where it will come against you
as long as you commit that sin my poor child you will never be worth one farthing to god
pray to our mother mary to help you
she will help you my child
pray to our blessed lady when that sin comes into your mind
i am sure you will do that will you not
you repent of all those sins
i am sure you do
and you will promise god now that by his holy grace you will never offend him any more by that wicked sin
you will make that solemn promise to god will you not
yes father
the old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quaking parching heart
how sweet and sad
do so my poor child
the devil has led you astray
drive him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body in that waythe foul spirit who hates our lord
promise god now that you will give up that sin that wretched wretched sin
blinded by his tears and by the light of mercifulness he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution spoken and saw the priests hand raised above him in token of forgiveness
god bless you my child
pray for me
he knelt to say his penance praying in a corner of the dark nave and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white rose
the muddy streets were gay
he strode homeward conscious of an invisible grace pervading and making light his limbs
in spite of all he had done it
he had confessed and god had pardoned him
his soul was made fair and holy once more holy and happy
it would be beautiful to die if god so willed
it was beautiful to live in grace a life of peace and virtue and forbearance with others
he sat by the fire in the kitchen not daring to speak for happiness
till that moment he had not known how beautiful and peaceful life could be
the green square of paper pinned round the lamp cast down a tender shade
on the dresser was a plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were eggs
they would be for the breakfast in the morning after the communion in the college chapel
white pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea
how simple and beautiful was life after all
and life lay all before him
in a dream he fell asleep
in a dream he rose and saw that it was morning
in a waking dream he went through the quiet morning towards the college
the boys were all there kneeling in their places
he knelt among them happy and shy
the altar was heaped with fragrant masses of white flowers and in the morning light the pale flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and silent as his own soul
he knelt before the altar with his classmates holding the altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands
his hands were trembling and his soul trembled as he heard the priest pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant
corpus domini nostri
could it be
he knelt there sinless and timid and he would hold upon his tongue the host and god would enter his purified body
in vitam eternam
amen another life
a life of grace and virtue and happiness
it was true
it was not a dream from which he would wake
the past was past
corpus domini nostri
the ciborium had come to him
chapter sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the holy trinity monday to the holy ghost tuesday to the guardian angels wednesday to saint joseph thursday to the most blessed sacrament of the altar friday to the suffering jesus saturday to the blessed virgin mary
every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of some holy image or mystery
his day began with an heroic offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass
the raw morning air whetted his resolute piety and often as he knelt among the few worshippers at the sidealtar following with his interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest he glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom between the two candles which were the old and the new testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the catacombs
his daily life was laid out in devotional areas
by means of ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly reward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for the agonising souls and fearful lest in the midst of the purgatorial fire which differed from the infernal only in that it was not everlasting his penance might avail no more than a drop of moisture he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of works of supererogation
every part of his day divided by what he regarded now as the duties of his station in life circled about its own centre of spiritual energy
his life seemed to have drawn near to eternity every thought word and deed every instance of consciousness could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven and at times his sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven not as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower
the rosaries too which he said constantlyfor he carried his beads loose in his trousers pockets that he might tell them as he walked the streetstransformed themselves into coronals of flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless
he offered up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues in faith in the father who had created him in hope in the son who had redeemed him and in love of the holy ghost who had sanctified him and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the three persons through mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful and glorious mysteries
on each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that one of the seven gifts of the holy ghost might descend upon his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins which had defiled it in the past and he prayed for each gift on its appointed day confident that it would descend upon him though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others
yet he believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the third person of the most blessed trinity
he believed this all the more and with trepidation because of the divine gloom and silence wherein dwelt the unseen paraclete whose symbols were a dove and a mighty wind to sin against whom was a sin beyond forgiveness the eternal mysterious secret being to whom as god the priests offered up mass once a year robed in the scarlet of the tongues of fire
the imagery through which the nature and kinship of the three persons of the trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the books of devotion which he readthe father contemplating from all eternity as in a mirror his divine perfections and thereby begetting eternally the eternal son and the holy spirit proceeding out of father and son from all eternitywere easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that god had loved his soul from all eternity for ages before he had been born into the world for ages before the world itself had existed
he had heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit had found them set forth solemnly in books and had wondered why his soul was unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter their names with conviction
a brief anger had often invested him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel
he had felt a subtle dark and murmurous presence penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust it too had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent
this it seemed was the only love and that the only hate his soul would harbour
but he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since god himself had loved his individual soul with divine love from all eternity
gradually as his soul was enriched with spiritual knowledge he saw the whole world forming one vast symmetrical expression of power and love
life became a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which were it even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree his soul should praise and thank the giver
the world for all its solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality
so entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue to live
yet that was part of the divine purpose and he dared not question its use he above all others who had sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose
meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications and only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself
the attitude of rapture in sacred art the raised and parted hands the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon became for him an image of the soul in prayer humiliated and faint before her creator
but he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exaltation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or lowliest devotion striving also by constant mortification to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught with peril
each of his senses was brought under a rigorous discipline
in order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him
his eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women
from time to time also he balked them by a sudden effort of the will as by lifting them suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing the book
to mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his voice which was then breaking neither sang nor whistled and made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the knifeboard the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the twigging of the carpet
to mortify his smell was more difficult as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as those of dung or tar or the odours of his own person among which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments
he found in the end that the only odour against which his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstanding urine and whenever it was possible he subjected himself to this unpleasant odour
to mortify the taste he practised strict habits at table observed to the letter all the fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind from the savours of different foods
but it was to the mortification of touch he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness
he never consciously changed his position in bed sat in the most uncomfortable positions suffered patiently every itch and pain kept away from the fire remained on his knees all through the mass except at the gospels left part of his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and whenever he was not saying his beads carried his arms stiffly at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped behind him
he had no temptations to sin mortally
it surprised him however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfections
his prayers and fasts availed him little for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at being disturbed in his devotions
it needed an immense effort of his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to such irritation
images of the outbursts of trivial anger which he had often noted among his masters their twitching mouths closeshut lips and flushed cheeks recurred to his memory discouraging him for all his practice of humility by the comparison
to merge his life in the common tide of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts and scruples
his soul traversed a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried up sources
his confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections
his actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the blessed sacrament
the book which he used for these visits was an old neglected book written by saint alphonsus liguori with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves
a faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicants prayers
an inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul telling her names and glories bidding her arise as for espousal and come away bidding her look forth a spouse from amana and from the mountains of the leopards and the soul seemed to answer with the same inaudible voice surrendering herself inter ubera mea commorabitur this idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his prayers and meditations
it gave him an intense sense of power to know that he could by a single act of consent in a moment of thought undo all that he had done
he seemed to feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his fevered skin
then almost at the instant of that touch almost at the verge of sinful consent he found himself standing far away from the flood upon a dry shore saved by a sudden act of the will or a sudden ejaculation and seeing the silver line of the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance towards his feet a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all
when he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him little by little
the clear certitude of his own immunity grew dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really fallen unawares
it was with difficulty that he won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had prayed to god at every temptation and that the grace which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as god was obliged to give it
the very frequency and violence of temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard about the trials of the saints
frequent and violent temptations were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that the devil raged to make it fall
often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples some momentary inattention at prayer a movement of trivial anger in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act he was bidden by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution was given him
he named it with humility and shame and repented of it once more
it humiliated and shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it wholly however holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might attain
a restless feeling of guilt would always be present with him he would confess and repent and be absolved confess and repent again and be absolved again fruitlessly
perhaps that first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had not been good
perhaps concerned only for his imminent doom he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin
but the surest sign that his confession had been good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was he knew the amendment of his life have amended my life have i not he asked himself
the director stood in the embrasure of the window his back to the light leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and as he spoke and smiled slowly dangling and looping the cord of the other blind stephen stood before him following for a moment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly fingers
the priests face was in total shadow but the waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples and the curves of the skull
stephen followed also with his ears the accents and intervals of the priests voice as he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes the vacation which had just ended the colleges of the order abroad the transference of masters
the grave and cordial voice went on easily with its tale and in the pauses stephen felt bound to set it on again with respectful questions
he knew that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for the sequel
ever since the message of summons had come for him from the director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message and during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the summons had almost become clear
then just as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from coming he had heard the handle of the door turning and the swish of a soutane
the director had begun to speak of the dominican and franciscan orders and of the friendship between saint thomas and saint bonaventure
the capuchin dress he thought was rather too face gave back the priests indulgent smile and not being anxious to give an opinion he made a slight dubitative movement with his lips believe continued the director that there is some talk now among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and following the example of the other franciscans suppose they would retain it in the cloisters said stephen certainly said the director
for the cloister it is all right but for the street i really think it would be better to do away with it donot you
it must be troublesome i imagine
of course it is of course
just imagine when i was in belgium i used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with this thing up about their knees
it was really ridiculous
les jupes they call them in belgium
the vowel was so modified as to be indistinct
what do they call them
les jupes
stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could not see on the priests shadowed face its image or spectre only passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell upon his ear
he gazed calmly before him at the waning sky glad of the cool of the evening and of the faint yellow glow which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek
the names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to his mind a delicate and sinful perfume
as a boy he had imagined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken bands and it shocked him to feel at stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness
it had shocked him too when he had felt for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of a womans stocking for retaining nothing of all he read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own state it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman moving with tender life
but the phrase on the priests lips was disingenuous for he knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme
the phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow
whatever he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside frankly as not borne out by his own experience
his masters even when they had not attracted him had seemed to him always intelligent and serious priests athletic and highspirited prefects
he thought of them as men who washed their bodies briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen
during all the years he had lived among them in clongowes and in belvedere he had received only two pandies and though these had been dealt him in the wrong he knew that he had often escaped punishment
during all those years he had never heard from any of his masters a flippant word it was they who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and when he had fallen into grievous sin it was they who had led him back to grace
their presence had made him diffident of himself when he was a muff in clongowes and it had made him diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal position in belvedere
a constant sense of this had remained with him up to the last year of his school life
he had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience and even when he doubted some statement of a master he had never presumed to doubt openly
lately some of their judgements had sounded a little childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and were hearing its language for the last time
one day when some boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the chapel he had heard the priest say believe that lord macaulay was a man who probably never committed a mortal sin in his life that is to say a deliberate mortal sin
some of the boys had then asked the priest if victor hugo were not the greatest french writer
the priest had answered that victor hugo had never written half so well when he had turned against the church as he had written when he was a catholic
but there are many eminent french critics said the priest who consider that even victor hugo great as he certainly was had not so pure a french style as louis veuillot
the tiny flame which the priests allusion had kindled upon cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still fixed calmly on the colourless sky
but an unresting doubt flew hither and thither before his mind
masked memories passed quickly before him he recognised scenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance in them
he saw himself walking about the grounds watching the sports in clongowes and eating slim jim out of his cricketcap
some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in the company of ladies
the echoes of certain expressions used in clongowes sounded in remote caves of his mind
his ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the silence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was addressing him in a different voice sent for you today stephen because i wished to speak to you on a very important subject
yes sir
have you ever felt that you had a vocation
stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the word suddenly
the priest waited for the answer and added mean have you ever felt within yourself in your soul a desire to join the order
think have sometimes thought of it said stephen
the priest let the blindcord fall to one side and uniting his hands leaned his chin gravely upon them communing with himself
in a college like this he said at length there is one boy or perhaps two or three boys whom god calls to the religious life
such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety by the good example he shows to others
he is looked up to by them he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists
and you stephen have been such a boy in this college prefect of our blessed sodality
perhaps you are the boy in this college whom god designs to call to himself
a strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priests voice made heart quicken in response
to receive that call stephen said the priest is the greatest honour that the almighty god can bestow upon a man
no king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of god
no angel or archangel in heaven no saint not even the blessed virgin herself has the power of a priest of god the power of the keys the power to bind and to loose from sin the power of exorcism the power to cast out from the creatures of god the evil spirits that have power over them the power the authority to make the great god of heaven come down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine
what an awful power stephen
a flame began to flutter again on cheek as he heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings
how often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in reverence
his soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire
he had seen himself a young and silentmannered priest entering a confessional swiftly ascending the altarsteps incensing genuflecting accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of their distance from it
in that dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various priests
he had bent his knee sideways like such a one he had shaken the thurible only slightly like such a one his chasuble had swung open like that of such another as he turned to the altar again after having blessed the people
and above all it had pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining
he shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final an office
he longed for the minor sacred offices to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass to stand aloof from the altar forgotten by the people his shoulders covered with a humeral veil holding the paten within its folds or when the sacrifice had been accomplished to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant his hands joined and his face towards the people and sing the chant ite missa est if ever he had seen himself celebrant it was as in the pictures of the mass in his childs massbook in a church without worshippers save for the angel of the sacrifice at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself
in vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality and it was partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he longed to give
he listened in reverent silence now to the priests appeal and through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bidding him approach offering him secret knowledge and secret power
he would know then what was the sin of simon magus and what the sin against the holy ghost for which there was no forgiveness
he would know obscure things hidden from others from those who were conceived and born children of wrath
he would know the sins the sinful longings and sinful thoughts and sinful acts of others hearing them murmured into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened chapel by the lips of women and of girls but rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of the altar
no touch of sin would linger upon the hands with which he would elevate and break the host no touch of sin would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink damnation to himself not discerning the body of the lord
he would hold his secret knowledge and secret power being as sinless as the innocent and he would be a priest for ever according to the order of melchisedec will offer up my mass tomorrow morning said the director that almighty god may reveal to you his holy will
and let you stephen make a novena to your holy patron saint the first martyr who is very powerful with god that god may enlighten your mind
but you must be quite sure stephen that you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found afterwards that you had none
once a priest always a priest remember
your catechism tells you that the sacrament of holy orders is one of those which can be received only once because it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be effaced
it is before you must weigh well not after
it is a solemn question stephen because on it may depend the salvation of your eternal soul
but we will pray to god together
he held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to a companion in the spiritual life
stephen passed out on to the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of the caress of mild evening air
towards church a quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their leaders concertina
the music passed in an instant as the first bars of sudden music always did over the fantastic fabrics of his mind dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children
smiling at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priests face and seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day detached his hand slowly which had acquiesced faintly in that companionship
as he descended the steps the impression which effaced his troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting a sunken day from the threshold of the college
the shadow then of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness
it was a grave and ordered and passionless life that awaited him a life without material cares
he wondered how he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory
the troubling odour of the long corridors of clongowes came back to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning gasflames
at once from every part of his being unrest began to irradiate
a feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly
his lungs dilated and sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the moist warm air which hung in the bath in clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water
some instinct waking at these memories stronger than education or piety quickened within him at every near approach to that life an instinct subtle and hostile and armed him against acquiescence
the chill and order of the life repelled him
he saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his stomach
he saw himself sitting at dinner with the community of a college
what then had become of that deeprooted shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange roof
what had come of the pride of his spirit which had always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every order
the reverend stephen dedalus his name in that new life leaped into characters before his eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of a face
the colour faded and became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red
was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests
the face was eyeless and sourfavoured and devout shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger
was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits whom some of the boys called lantern jaws and others foxy campbell
he was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in gardiner street and wondered vaguely which window would be his if he ever joined the order
then he wondered at the vagueness of his wonder at the remoteness of his own soul from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary at the frail hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to end for ever in time and in eternity his freedom
the voice of the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory
his soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formal tale
he would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as priest
his destiny was to be elusive of social or religious orders
the wisdom of the priests appeal did not touch him to the quick
he was destined to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world
the snares of the world were its ways of sin
he would fall
he had not yet fallen but he would fall silently in an instant
not to fall was too hard too hard and he felt the silent lapse of his soul as it would be at some instant to come falling falling but not yet fallen still unfallen but about to fall
he crossed the bridge over the stream of the tolka and turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue shrine of the blessed virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages
then bending to the left he followed the lane which led up to his house
the faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above the river
he smiled to think that it was this disorder the misrule and confusion of his fathers house and the stagnation of vegetable life which was to win the day in his soul
then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen gardens behind their house whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat
a second laugh taking rise from the first after a pause broke from him involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat worked considering in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging his spade in the earth
he pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed through the naked hallway into the kitchen
a group of his brothers and sisters was sitting round the table
tea was nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars and jampots which did service for teacups
discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them lay scattered on the table
little wells of tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover
the sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through the window and the open door covering over and allaying quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in heart
all that had been denied them had been freely given to him the eldest but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign of rancour
he sat near them at the table and asked where his father and mother were
one answered goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro
still another removal
a boy named fallon in belvedere had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often
a frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again the silly laugh of the questioner
he asked why are we on the move again if its a fair question
becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro usboro outboro
the voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of the fireplace began to sing the air oft in the stilly night
one by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was singing
they would sing so for hours melody after melody glee after glee till the last pale light died down on the horizon till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night fell
he waited for some moments listening before he too took up the air with them
he was listening with pain of spirit to the overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices
even before they set out on lifes journey they seemed weary already of the way
he heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and multiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless generations of children and heard in all the echoes an echo also of the recurring note of weariness and pain
all seemed weary of life even before entering upon it
and he remembered that newman had heard this note also in the broken lines of virgil giving utterance like the voice of nature herself to that pain and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the experience of her children in every time
he could wait no longer
from the door of publichouse to the gate of clontarf chapel from the gate of clontarf chapel to the door of publichouse and then back again to the chapel and then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at first planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath then timing their fall to the fall of verses
a full hour had passed since his father had gone in with dan crosby the tutor to find out for him something about the university
for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his fathers shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe
yes his mother was hostile to the idea as he had read from her listless silence
yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his fathers pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes
a dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed cloudlike leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives
the university
so he had passed beyond the challenge of the sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to them and serve their ends
pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
the end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him
it seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished fourth upwards a tone and downwards a major third like triplebranching flames leaping fitfully flame after flame out of a midnight wood
it was an elfin prelude endless and formless and as it grew wilder and faster the flames leaping out of time he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves
their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind the feet of hares and rabbits the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from newman whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms
the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
all through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside obeying a wayward instinct
now time lay between the oils of ordination would never anoint his body
he had refused
why
he turned seaward from the road at dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet
a squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the bull and had begun to pass two by two across the bridge
soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
the uncouth faces passed him two by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy silk hats and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes
brother hickey
brother quaid
brother brother keogh
their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
he drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself day of dappled seaborne clouds
the phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a chord
words
was it their colours
he allowed them to glow and fade hue after hue sunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchards azure of waves the greyfringed fleece of clouds
no it was not their colours it was the poise and balance of the period itself
did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour
or was it that being as weak of sight as he was shy of mind he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose
he passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again
at that instant as it seemed to him the air was chilled and looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide
a faint click at his heart a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the rivers mouth
a veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed
in the distance along the course of the slowflowing liffey slender masts flecked the sky and more distant still the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze
like a scene on some vague arras old as mans weariness the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote
disheartened he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting clouds dappled and seaborne
they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of nomads on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races
he heard a confused music within him as of memories and names which he was almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant then the music seemed to recede to recede to recede and from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one longdrawn calling note piercing like a star the dusk of silence
again
again
again
a voice from beyond the world was calling
hello stephanos

he recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces
the mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone
their bodies corpsewhite or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun gleamed with the wet of the sea
their divingstone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre
the towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair
he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
how characterless they looked shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp and connolly without his norfolk coat with the flapless sidepockets
it was a pain to see them and a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness
perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls
but he apart from them and in silence remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body
stephanos dedalos
bous stephanoumenos
bous stephaneforos
their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty
now as never before his strange name seemed to him a prophecy
so timeless seemed the grey warm air so fluid and impersonal his own mood that all ages were as one to him
a moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped city
now at the name of the fabulous artificer he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air
what did it mean
was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols a hawklike man flying sunward above the sea a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being
his heart trembled his breath came faster and a wild spirit passed over his limbs as though he was soaring sunward
his heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight
his soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude and made radiant and commingled with the element of the spirit
an ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs

stephaneforos
his throat ached with a desire to cry aloud the cry of a hawk or eagle on high to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds
this was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar
an instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain
stephaneforos
what were they now but cerements shaken from the body of deaththe fear he had walked in night and day the incertitude that had ringed him round the shame that had abased him within and withoutcerements the linens of the grave
his soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood spurning her graveclothes
yes
yes
yes
he would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul as the great artificer whose name he bore a living thing new and soaring and beautiful impalpable imperishable
he started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood
he felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song
there was a lust of wandering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the earth
on
on his heart seemed to cry
evening would deepen above the sea night fall upon the plains dawn glimmer before the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces
where
he looked northward towards howth
the sea had fallen below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater and already the tide was running out fast along the foreshore
already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and dry amid the wavelets
here and there warm isles of sand gleamed above the shallow tide and about the isles and around the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were lightclad figures wading and delving
in a few moments he was barefoot his stockings folded in his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and picking a pointed salteaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks he clambered down the slope of the breakwater
there was a long rivulet in the strand and as he waded slowly up its course he wondered at the endless drift of seaweed
emerald and black and russet and olive it moved beneath the current swaying and turning
the water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting clouds
the clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins
where was his boyhood now
where was the soul that had hung back from her destiny to brood alone upon the shame of her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the touch
or where was he
he was alone
he was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart of life
he was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures of children and girls and voices childish and girlish in the air
a girl stood before him in midstream alone and still gazing out to sea
she seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird
her long slender bare legs were delicate as a cranes and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh
her thighs fuller and softhued as ivory were bared almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down
her slateblue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her
her bosom was as a birds soft and slight slight and soft as the breast of some darkplumaged dove
but her long fair hair was girlish and girlish and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty her face
she was alone and still gazing out to sea and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze without shame or wantonness
long long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither
the first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence low and faint and whispering faint as the bells of sleep hither and thither hither and thither and a faint flame trembled on her cheek
heavenly god cried soul in an outburst of profane joy
he turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand
his cheeks were aflame his body was aglow his limbs were trembling
on and on and on and on he strode far out over the sands singing wildly to the sea crying to greet the advent of the life that had cried to him
her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy
her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call
to live to err to fall to triumph to recreate life out of life
a wild angel had appeared to him the angel of mortal youth and beauty an envoy from the fair courts of life to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory
on and on and on and on
he halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence
how far had he walked
what hour was it
there was no human figure near him nor any sound borne to him over the air
but the tide was near the turn and already the day was on the wane
he turned landward and ran towards the shore and running up the sloping beach reckless of the sharp shingle found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sandknolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the evening might still the riot of his blood
he felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies and the earth beneath him the earth that had borne him had taken him to her breast
he closed his eyes in the languor of sleep
his eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world
his soul was swooning into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as under sea traversed by cloudy shapes and beings
a world a glimmer or a flower
glimmering and trembling trembling and unfolding a breaking light an opening flower it spread in endless succession to itself breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest rose leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light flooding all the heavens with its soft flushes every flush deeper than the other
evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer
he rose slowly and recalling the rapture of his sleep sighed at its joy
he climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him
evening had fallen
a rim of the young moon cleft the pale waste of skyline the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey sand and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low whisper of her waves islanding a few last figures in distant pools
chapter he drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him staring into the dark pool of the jar
the yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turfcoloured water of the bath in clongowes
the box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as daly or pair buskins
coat
articles and white
pants
then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the box speckled with louse marks and asked vaguely how much is the clock fast now
his mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on its side in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more on its side
an hour and twentyfive minutes she said
the right time now is twenty past ten
the dear knows you might try to be in time for your lectures
fill out the place for me to wash said stephen
katey fill out the place for stephen to wash
boody fill out the place for stephen to wash canot going for blue
fill it out you maggy
when the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose
well its a poor case she said when a university student is so dirty that his mother has to wash him
but it gives you pleasure said stephen calmly
an earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrust a damp overall into his hands saying dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness
a second shrill whistle prolonged angrily brought one of the girls to the foot of the staircase
yes father
is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet
yes father
sure
yes father
hm
the girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go out quietly by the back
stephen laughed and said he has a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is masculine
ah its a scandalous shame for you stephen said his mother and youll live to rue the day you set your foot in that place
i know how it has changed you
good morning everybody said stephen smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu
the lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns madhouse beyond the wall
jesus
jesus
jesus
he shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on stumbling through the mouldering offal his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness
his fathers whistle his mothers mutterings the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth
he drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration but as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark his soul was loosed of her miseries
the rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him as always memories of the girls and women in the plays of gerhart hauptmann and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy
his morning walk across the city had begun and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of fairview he would think of the cloistral silverveined prose of newman that as he walked along the north strand road glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops he would recall the dark humour of guido cavalcanti and smile that as he went by stonecutting works in talbot place the spirit of ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind a spirit of wayward boyish beauty and that passing a grimy marine dealers shop beyond the liffey he would repeat the song by ben jonson which begins i was not wearier where i lay
his mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral words of aristotle or aquinas turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the elizabethans
his mind in the vesture of a doubting monk stood often in shadow under the windows of that age to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waistcoateers until a laugh too low a phrase tarnished by time of chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurkingplace
the lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences from poetics and psychology and a synopsis philosophi scholastic ad mentem divi thom
his thinking was a dusk of doubt and selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in reverie at least he had been acquainted with nobility
but when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart
near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the dolls face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of the bridge with little steps tightly buttoned into his chocolate overcoat and holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a divining rod
it must be eleven he thought and peered into a dairy to see the time
the clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but as he turned away he heard a clock somewhere near him but unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision
he laughed as he heard it for it made him think of and he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee standing in the wind at hopkins corner and heard him say dedalus youre an antisocial being wrapped up in yourself not a democrat and work and act for social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the united states of the europe of the future
eleven
then he was late for that lecture too
what day of the week was it
he stopped at a newsagents to read the headline of a placard
thursday
ten to eleven english eleven to twelve french twelve to one physics
he fancied to himself the english lecture and felt even at that distance restless and helpless
he saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note nominal definitions essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death chief works a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side
his own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellardamp and decay
another head than his right before him in the first benches was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him
why was it that when he thought of cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face
even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream the face of a severed head or death mask crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown
it was a priestlike face priestlike in its pallor in the wide winged nose in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling and stephen remembering swiftly how he had told cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul day after day and night by night only to be answered by his friends listening silence would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes
through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter it
but the nightshade of his friends listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language
his own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms the ivy whines upon the wall and whines and twines upon the wall the yellow ivy upon the wall ivy ivy up the wall
did anyone ever hear such drivel
lord almighty
who ever heard of ivy whining on a wall
yellow ivy that was all right
yellow ivory also
and what about ivory ivy
the word now shone in his brain clearer and brighter than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants
ivory ivoire avorio ebur one of the first examples that he had learnt in latin had run india mittit ebur and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the metamorphoses of ovid in a courtly english made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon
he had learnt what little he knew of the laws of latin verse from a ragged book written by a portuguese priest
contrahit orator variant in carmine vates
the crises and victories and secessions in roman history were handed on to him in the trite words in tanto discrimine and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through the words implere ollam denariorum which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries
the pages of his timeworn horace never felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold they were human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers of john duncan inverarity and by his brother william malcolm inverarity
yes those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and even for so poor a latinist as he the dusky verses were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and vervain but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the worlds culture and that the monkish learning in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry
the grey block of trinity on his left set heavily in the citys ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring pulled his mind downward and while he was striving this way and that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of ireland
he looked at it without anger for though sloth of the body and of the soul crept over it like unseen vermin over the shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the servile head it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity
it was a firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a milesian and he thought of his friend davin the peasant student
it was a jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it lightly go on stevie i have a hard head you tell me
call me what you will
the homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him
often as he sat in rooms in grantham street wondering at his friends wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friends simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection the rude firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old english speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skillfor davin had sat at the feet of michael cusack the swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes the terror of soul of a starving irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear
side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle mat davin the athlete the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of ireland
the gossip of his fellowstudents which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian
his nurse had taught him irish and shaped his rude imagination by the broken lights of irish myth
he stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the roman catholic religion the attitude of a dullwitted loyal serf
whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from england or by way of english culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password and of the world that lay beyond england he knew only the foreign legion of france in which he spoke of serving
coupling this ambition with the young mans humour stephen had often called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between mind eager of speculation and the hidden ways of irish life
one night the young peasant his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt had called up before mind a strange vision
the two were walking slowly towards rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews thing happened to myself stevie last autumn coming on winter and i never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now i ever told it to
i disremember if it was october or november
it was october because it was before i came up here to join the matriculation class
stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friends face flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speakers simple accent was away all that day from my own place over in buttevanti donot know if you know where that isat a hurling match between the own boys and the fearless thurles and by god stevie that was the hard fight
my first cousin fonsy davin was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for the limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time and shouting like mad
i never will forget that day
one of the crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and i declare to god he was within an aims ace of getting it at the side of his temple
oh honest to god if the crook of it caught him that time he was done for am glad he escaped stephen had said with a laugh but surely thats not the strange thing that happened you
well i suppose that doesnot interest you but leastways there was such noise after the match that i missed the train home and i couldnot get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for as luck would have it there was a mass meeting that same day over in castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there
so there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out
well i started to walk and on i went and it was coming on night when i got into the ballyhoura hills thats better than ten miles from kilmallock and theres a long lonely road after that
you wouldnot see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound
it was pitch dark almost
once or twice i stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick have stretched out there and slept
at last after a bend of the road i spied a little cottage with a light in the window
i went up and knocked at the door
a voice asked who was there and i answered i was over at the match in buttevant and was walking back and that be thankful for a glass of water
after a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk
she was half undressed as if she was going to bed when i knocked and she had her hair hanging and i thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child
she kept me in talk a long while at the door and i thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare
she asked me was i tired and would i like to stop the night there
she said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to queenstown with his sister to see her off
and all the time she was talking stevie she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me i could hear her breathing
when i handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said come in and stay the night here no call to be frightened no one in it but i didnot go in stevie
i thanked her and went on my way again all in a fever
at the first bend of the road i looked back and she was standing at the door
the last words of story sang in his memory and the figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at clane as the college cars drove by as a type of her race and of his own a batlike soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile calling the stranger to her bed
a hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried ah gentleman your own girl sir
the first handsel today gentleman
buy that lovely bunch
will you gentleman
the blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face
do gentleman forget your own girl sir have no money said stephen
buy them lovely ones will you sir
only a penny
did you hear what i said asked stephen bending towards her
i told you i had no money
i tell you again now
well sure you will some day sir please god the girl answered after an instant
possibly said stephen but i donot think it likely
he left her quickly fearing that her intimacy might turn to gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another a tourist from england or a student of trinity
grafton street along which he walked prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty
in the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of wolfe tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying
he remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute
there were four french delegates in a brake and one a plump smiling young man held wedged on a stick a card on which were printed the words vive but the trees in green were fragrant of rain and the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour a faint incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts
the soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other than that of buck egan and burnchapel whaley
it was too late to go upstairs to the french class
he crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre
the corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful
why did he feel that it was not unwatchful
was it because he had heard that in buck time there was a secret staircase there
or was the jesuit house extraterritorial and was he walking among aliens
the ireland of tone and of parnell seemed to have receded in space
he opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that struggled through the dusty windows
a figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire
stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace
good morning sir
can i help you
the priest looked up quickly and said one moment now mr dedalus and you will see
there is an art in lighting a fire
we have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts
this is one of the useful arts will try to learn it said stephen
not too much coal said the dean working briskly at his task that is one of the secrets
he produced four candlebutts from the sidepockets of his soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers
stephen watched him in silence
kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candlebutts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple a levite of the lord
like a levites robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bellbordered ephod would irk and trouble
his very body had waxed old in lowly service of the tending the fire upon the altar in bearing tidings secretly in waiting upon worldlings in striking swiftly when biddenand yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty
nay his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctitya mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body spare and sinewy greyed with a silverpointed down
the dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch
stephen to fill the silence said am sure i could not light a fire
you are an artist are you not mr dedalus said the dean glancing up and blinking his pale eyes
the object of the artist is the creation of the beautiful
what the beautiful is is another question
he rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty
can you solve that question now he asked
aquinas answered stephen says pulcra sunt qu visa placent
this fire before us said the dean will be pleasing to the eye
will it therefore be beautiful
in so far as it is apprehended by the sight which i suppose means here esthetic intellection it will be beautiful
but aquinas also says bonum est in quod tendit appetitus
in so far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good
in hell however it is an evil
quite so said the dean you have certainly hit the nail on the head
he rose nimbly and went towards the door set it ajar and said draught is said to be a help in these matters
as he came back to the hearth limping slightly but with a brisk step stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless eyes
like ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of ignatius enthusiasm
even the legendary craft of the company a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship
it seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world as bidden to do for the greater glory of god without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and little if at all the ends he served
similiter atque senis baculus he was as the founder would have had him like a staff in an old mans hand to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather to lie with a ladys nosegay on a garden seat to be raised in menace
the dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin
when may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic question he asked
from me said stephen in astonishment
i stumble on an idea once a fortnight if i am lucky
these questions are very profound mr dedalus said the dean
it is like looking down from the cliffs of moher into the depths
many go down into the depths and never come up
only the trained diver can go down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again
if you mean speculation sir said stephen i also am sure that there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bound by its own laws

for my purpose i can work on at present by the light of one or two ideas of aristotle and aquinas see
i quite see your point need them only for my own use and guidance until i have done something for myself by their light
if the lamp smokes or smells i shall try to trim it
if it does not give light enough i shall sell it and buy another
epictetus also had a lamp said the dean which was sold for a fancy price after his death
it was the lamp he wrote his philosophical dissertations by
you know epictetus
an old gentleman said stephen coarsely who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water
he tells us in his homely way the dean went on that he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the lamp
what did the philosopher do
he reflected that it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp
a smell of molten tallow came up from the deans candle butts and fused itself in consciousness with the jingle of the words bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket
the priests voice too had a hard jingling tone mind halted by instinct checked by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priests face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus
what lay behind it or within it
a dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of god meant a different kind of lamp sir said stephen
undoubtedly said the dean
one difficulty said stephen in esthetic discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace
i remember a sentence of in which he says of the blessed virgin that she was detained in the full company of the saints
the use of the word in the marketplace is quite different hope i am not detaining you not in the least said the dean politely
no no said stephen smiling i yes i see said the dean quickly i quite catch the point detain
he thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough
to return to the lamp he said the feeding of it is also a nice problem
you must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it not to pour in more than the funnel can hold
what funnel asked stephen
the funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp
that said stephen
is that called a funnel
is it not a tundish
what is a tundish
that
the the funnel
is that called a tundish in ireland asked the dean
i never heard the word in my life
it is called a tundish in lower drumcondra said stephen laughing where they speak the best english tundish said the dean reflectively
that is a most interesting word
i must look that word up
upon my word i must
his courtesy of manner rang a little false and stephen looked at the english convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal
a humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions a poor englishman in ireland he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given througha latecomer a tardy spirit
from what had he set out
perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters seeing salvation in jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the establishment
had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms six principle men peculiar people seed and snake baptists supralapsarian dogmatists
had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the holy ghost
or had lord christ touched him and bidden him follow like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom as he sat by the door of some zincroofed chapel yawning and telling over his church pence
the dean repeated the word yet again
tundish
well now that is interesting
the question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting
what is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth said stephen coldly
the little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe
he felt with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a countryman of ben jonson
he thought the language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine
how different are the words home christ ale master on his lips and on mine
i cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit
his language so familiar and so foreign will always be for me an acquired speech
i have not made or accepted its words
my voice holds them at bay
my soul frets in the shadow of his language
and to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime the dean added to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty
and to inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts
these are some interesting points we might take up
stephen disheartened suddenly by the deans firm dry tone was silent and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the staircase
in pursuing these speculations said the dean conclusively there is however the danger of perishing of inanition
first you must take your degree
set that before you as your first aim
then little by little you will see your way
i mean in every sense your way in life and in thinking
it may be uphill pedalling at first
take mr moonan
he was a long time before he got to the top
but he got there may not have his talent said stephen quietly
you never know said the dean brightly
we never can say what is in us
i most certainly should not be despondent
per aspera ad astra he left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first arts class
leaning against the fireplace stephen heard him greet briskly and impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students
a desolating pity began to fall like dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly loyola for this halfbrother of the clergy more venal than they in speech more steadfast of soul than they one whom he would never call his ghostly father and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded during all their history at the bar of justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent
the entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows
the calling of the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all tones until the name of peter byrne was reached
here
a deep bass note in response came from the upper tier followed by coughs of protest along the other benches
the professor paused in his reading and called the next name cranly
no answer
mr cranly
a smile flew across face as he thought of his friends studies
try leopardstown said a voice from the bench behind
stephen glanced up quickly but snoutish face outlined on the grey light was impassive
a formula was given out
amid the rustling of the notebooks stephen turned back again and said give me some paper for sake
are you as bad as that asked moynihan with a broad grin
he tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down whispering in case of necessity any layman or woman can do it
the formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded mind
he had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason the grey dull day
it seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which souls of mathematicians might wander projecting long slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster farther and more impalpable
so we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal
perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of mr gilbert
in one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to play on a cloth untrue with a twisted cue and elliptical billiard balls
he means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal axes of which i spoke a moment ago moynihan leaned down towards ear and murmured what price ellipsoidal balls chase me ladies in the cavalry
his fellow students rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of mind shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule
the forms of the community emerged from the gustblown vestments the dean of studies the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair the president the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses the squat peasant form of the professor of economics the tall form of the young professor of mental science discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes the grave troubled prefect of the sodality the plump roundheaded professor of italian with his rogues eyes
they came ambling and stumbling tumbling and capering kilting their gowns for leap frog holding one another back shaken with deep false laughter smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude malice calling to one another by familiar nicknames protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usage whispering two and two behind their hands
the professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils blew away the dust from many points and bearing it carefully to the table held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture
he explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound called platinoid lately discovered by martino
he spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer
moynihan whispered from behind good old fresh water martin
ask him stephen whispered back with weary humour if he wants a subject for electrocution
he can have me
moynihan seeing the professor bend over the coils rose in his bench and clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin please teacher
this boy is after saying a bad word teacher
platinoid the professor said solemnly is preferred to german silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance by changes of temperature
the platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is
if it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the coils
the bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax
a sharp ulster voice said from the bench below stephen are we likely to be asked questions on applied science
the professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and applied science
a heavybuilt student wearing gold spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner
moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice a devil for his pound of flesh
stephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair
the voice the accent the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness bidding his mind think that the students father would have done better had he sent his son to belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing
the oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring for he saw in a moment the students wheypale face
that thought is not mine he said to himself quickly
it came from the comic irishman in the bench behind
patience
can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its elect betrayedby the questioner or by the mocker
patience
remember epictetus
it is probably in his character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word science as a monosyllable
the droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and round the coils it spoke of doubling trebling quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell closing time gents
the entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk
on a table near the door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures went briskly to and fro among the students talking rapidly answering rebuffs and leading one after another to the table
in the inner hall the dean of studies stood talking to a young professor stroking his chin gravely and nodding his head
stephen checked by the crowd at the door halted irresolutely
from under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat dark eyes were watching him
have you signed
stephen asked
cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth communed with himself an instant and answered ego habeo
what is it for
what is it for
cranly turned his pale face to stephen and said blandly and bitterly per pax universalis stephen pointed to the photograph and said he has the face of a besotted christ
the scorn and anger in his voice brought eyes back from a calm survey of the walls of the hall
are you annoyed he asked
no answered stephen
are you in bad humour
no
credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis said cranly quia facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis moynihan on his way to the table said in ear is in tiptop form
ready to shed the last drop
brand new world
no stimulants and votes for the bitches
stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and when moynihan had passed turned again to meet eyes
perhaps you can tell me he said why he pours his soul so freely into my ear
can you
a dull scowl appeared on forehead
he stared at the table where moynihan had bent to write his name on the roll and then said flatly sugar
quis est in malo humore said stephen ego aut vos cranly did not take up the taunt
he brooded sourly on his judgement and repeated with the same flat force flaming bloody sugar thats what he is
it was his epitaph for all dead friendships and stephen wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory
the heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a quagmire
stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another feeling its heaviness depress his heart speech unlike that of davin had neither rare phrases of elizabethan english nor quaintly turned versions of irish idioms
its drawl was an echo of the quays of dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport its energy an echo of the sacred eloquence of dublin given back flatly by a wicklow pulpit
the heavy scowl faded from face as marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall
here you are said cheerily
here i am said stephen
late as usual
can you not combine the progressive tendency with a respect for punctuality
that question is out of order said stephen
next business
his smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandists breastpocket
a little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits
a lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth
cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely turning it over and over
next business said hom
he gave a loud cough of laughter smiled broadly and tugged twice at the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin
the next business is to sign the testimonial
will you pay me anything if i sign asked stephen thought you were an idealist said the gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice
by hell thats a queer notion
i consider that notion to be a mercenary notion
his voice faded into silence
no heed was paid to his words
he turned his olive face equine in expression towards stephen inviting him to speak again began to speak with fluent energy of the rescript of stead of general disarmament arbitration in cases of international disputes of the signs of the times of the new humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number
the gipsy student responded to the close of the period by crying three cheers for universal brotherhood
go on temple said a stout ruddy student near him stand you a pint after a believer in universal brotherhood said temple glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes
marx is only a bloody cod
cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue smiling uneasily and repeated easy easy easy
temple struggled to free his arm but continued his mouth flecked by a thin foam socialism was founded by an irishman and the first man in europe who preached the freedom of thought was collins
two hundred years ago he denounced priestcraft the philosopher of middlesex
three cheers for john anthony collins
a thin voice from the verge of the ring replied pip pip
moynihan murmured beside ear and what about john poor little sister lottie collins lost her drawers you kindly lend her yours
stephen laughed and moynihan pleased with the result murmured again have five bob each way on john anthony collins am waiting for your answer said briefly
the affair doesnot interest me in the least said stephen wearily
you know that well
why do you make a scene about it
good said smacking his lips
you are a reactionary then
do you think you impress me stephen asked when you flourish your wooden sword
metaphors said bluntly
come to facts
stephen blushed and turned aside stood his ground and said with hostile humour minor poets i suppose are above such trivial questions as the question of universal peace
cranly raised his head and held the handball between the two students by way of a peaceoffering saying pax super totum sanguinarium globum stephen moving away the bystanders jerked his shoulder angrily in the direction of the image saying keep your icon
if we must have a jesus let us have a legitimate jesus
by hell thats a good one said the gipsy student to those about him thats a fine expression
i like that expression immensely
he gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping down the phrase and fumbling at the peak of his tweed cap turned to stephen saying excuse me sir what do you mean by that expression you uttered just now
feeling himself jostled by the students near him he said to them am curious to know now what he meant by that expression
he turned again to stephen and said in a whisper do you believe in jesus
i believe in man
of course i donot know if you believe in man
i admire you sir
i admire the mind of man independent of all religions
is that your opinion about the mind of jesus
go on temple said the stout ruddy student returning as was his wont to his first idea that pint is waiting for you
he thinks an imbecile temple explained to stephen because a believer in the power of mind
cranly linked his arms into those of stephen and his admirer and said nos ad manum ballum jocabimus stephen in the act of being led away caught sight of flushed bluntfeatured face
my signature is of no account he said politely
you are right to go your way
leave me to go mine
dedalus said crisply i believe youre a good fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the human individual
a voice said intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in it
stephen recognising the harsh tone of voice did not turn in the direction of the voice
cranly pushed solemnly through the throng of students linking stephen and temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to the altar
temple bent eagerly across breast and said did you hear what he said
that youth is jealous of you
did you see that
i bet cranly didnot see that
by hell i saw that at once
as they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in the act of escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing
he stood at the foot of the staircase a foot on the lowest step his threadbare soutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care nodding his head often and repeating not a doubt of it mr hackett
very fine
not a doubt of it
in the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality was speaking earnestly in a soft querulous voice with a boarder
as he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and bit between his phrases at a tiny bone pencil hope the matric men will all come
the first arts men are pretty sure
second arts too
we must make sure of the newcomers
temple bent again across cranly as they were passing through the doorway and said in a swift whisper do you know that he is a married man
he was a married man before they converted him
he has a wife and children somewhere
by hell i think thats the queerest notion i ever heard
eh
his whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter
the moment they were through the doorway cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shook him saying you flaming floundering fool take my dying bible there isnot a bigger bloody ape do you know than you in the whole flaming bloody world
temple wriggled in his grip laughing still with sly content while cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake flaming flaring bloody idiot
they crossed the weedy garden together
the president wrapped in a heavy loose cloak was coming towards them along one of the walks reading his office
at the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes
the students saluted temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap they walked forward in silence
as they neared the alley stephen could hear the thuds of the players hands and the wet smacks of the ball and voice crying out excitedly at each stroke
the three students halted round the box on which davin sat to follow the game
temple after a few moments sidled across to stephen and said excuse me i wanted to ask you do you believe that jean jacques rousseau was a sincere man
stephen laughed outright
cranly picking up the broken stave of a cask from the grass at his feet turned swiftly and said sternly temple i declare to the living god if you say another word do you know to anybody on any subject kill you super spottum he was like you i fancy said stephen an emotional man
blast him curse him said cranly broadly talk to him at all
sure you might as well be talking do you know to a flaming chamberpot as talking to temple
go home temple
for sake go home donot care a damn about you cranly answered temple moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at stephen the only man i see in this institution that has an individual mind
institution
individual cried cranly
go home blast you for youre a hopeless bloody man an emotional man said temple quite rightly expressed
and proud that an emotionalist
he sidled out of the alley smiling slily
cranly watched him with a blank expressionless face
look at him he said
did you ever see such a gobythewall
his phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against the wall his peaked cap down on his eyes
the laugh pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame seemed like the whinny of an elephant
the students body shook all over and to ease his mirth he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins
lynch is awake said cranly
lynch for answer straightened himself and thrust forward his chest
lynch puts out his chest said stephen as a criticism of life
lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said who has anything to say about my girth
cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle
when their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart panting
stephen bent down towards davin who intent on the game had paid no heed to the talk of the others
and how is my little tame goose he asked
did he sign too
davin nodded and said and you stevie
stephen shook his head a terrible man stevie said davin taking the short pipe from his mouth always alone
now that you have signed the petition for universal peace said stephen i suppose you will burn that little copybook i saw in your room
as davin did not answer stephen began to quote long pace fianna
right incline fianna
fianna by numbers salute one two a different question said davin an irish nationalist first and foremost
but thats you all out a born sneerer stevie
when you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks said stephen and want the indispensable informer tell me
i can find you a few in this college canot understand you said davin
one time i hear you talk against english literature
now you talk against the irish informers
what with your name and your ideas are you irish at all
come with me now to the office of arms and i will show you the tree of my family said stephen
then be one of us said davin
why donot you learn irish
why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson
you know one reason why answered stephen
davin tossed his head and laughed
oh come now he said
is it on account of that certain young lady and father moran
but thats all in your own mind stevie
they were only talking and laughing
stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon shoulder
do you remember he said when we knew each other first
the first morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculation class putting a very strong stress on the first syllable
you remember
then you used to address the jesuits as father you remember
i ask myself about you is he as innocent as his speech a simple person said davin
you know that
when you told me that night in harcourt street those things about your private life honest to god stevie i was not able to eat my dinner
i was quite bad
i was awake a long time that night
why did you tell me those things
thanks said stephen
you mean i am a monster
no said davin
but i wish you had not told me
a tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of friendliness
this race and this country and this life produced me he said
i shall express myself as i am
try to be one of us repeated davin
in heart you are an irishman but your pride is too powerful
my ancestors threw off their language and took another stephen said
they allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them
do you fancy i am going to pay in my own life and person debts they made
what for
for our freedom said davin
no honourable and sincere man said stephen has given up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of tone to those of parnell but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another
and you invite me to be one of you see you damned first
they died for their ideals stevie said davin
our day will come yet believe me
stephen following his own thought was silent for an instant
the soul is born he said vaguely first in those moments i told you of
it has a slow and dark birth more mysterious than the birth of the body
when the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight
you talk to me of nationality language religion
i shall try to fly by those nets
davin knocked the ashes from his pipe
too deep for me stevie he said
but a mans country comes first
ireland first stevie
you can be a poet or a mystic after
do you know what ireland is asked stephen with cold violence
ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow
davin rose from his box and went towards the players shaking his head sadly
but in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing with cranly and the two players who had finished their game
a match of four was arranged cranly insisting however that his ball should be used
he let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley exclaiming in answer to its thud your soul
stephen stood with lynch till the score began to rise
then he plucked him by the sleeve to come away
lynch obeyed saying let us eke go as cranly has it
stephen smiled at this sidethrust
they passed back through the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter was pinning up a hall notice in the frame
at the foot of the steps they halted and stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and offered it to his companion know you are poor he said
damn your yellow insolence answered lynch
this second proof of culture made stephen smile again
it was a great day for european culture he said when you made up your mind to swear in yellow
they lit their cigarettes and turned to the right
after a pause stephen began aristotle has not defined pity and terror
i have
i say
lynch halted and said bluntly stop
i wonot listen
i am sick
i was out last night on a yellow drunk with horan and goggins
stephen went on pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the human sufferer
terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret cause
repeat said lynch
stephen repeated the definitions slowly girl got into a hansom a few days ago he went on in london
she was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years
at the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a star
a long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart
she died on the instant
the reporter called it a tragic death
it is not
it is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions
the tragic emotion in fact is a face looking two ways towards terror and towards pity both of which are phases of it
you see i use the word arrest
i mean that the tragic emotion is static
or rather the dramatic emotion is
the feelings excited by improper art are kinetic desire or loathing
desire urges us to possess to go to something loathing urges us to abandon to go from something
the arts which excite them pornographical or didactic are therefore improper arts
the esthetic emotion used the general term is therefore static
the mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing
you say that art must not excite desire said lynch
i told you that one day i wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the venus of praxiteles in the museum
was that not desire speak of normal natures said stephen
you also told me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung
lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets
i did
i did he cried
stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment boldly in the eyes
lynch recovering from his laughter answered his look from his humbled eyes
the long slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought before mind the image of a hooded reptile
the eyes too were reptilelike in glint and gaze
yet at that instant humbled and alert in their look they were lit by one tiny human point the window of a shrivelled soul poignant and selfembittered
as for that stephen said in polite parenthesis we are all animals
i also am an animal
you are said lynch
but we are just now in a mental world stephen continued
the desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also because they are not more than physical
our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nervous system
our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye
not always said lynch critically
in the same way said stephen your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue but it was i say simply a reflex action of the nerves
beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical
it awakens or ought to awaken or induces or ought to induce an esthetic stasis an ideal pity or an ideal terror a stasis called forth prolonged and at last dissolved by what i call the rhythm of beauty
what is that exactly asked lynch
rhythm said stephen is the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part
if that is rhythm said lynch let me hear what you call beauty and please remember though i did eat a cake of cowdung once that i admire only beauty
stephen raised his cap as if in greeting
then blushing slightly he laid his hand on thick tweed sleeve
we are right he said and the others are wrong
to speak of these things and to try to understand their nature and having understood it to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express to press out again from the gross earth or what it brings forth from sound and shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul an image of the beauty we have come to understandthat is art they had reached the canal bridge and turning from their course went on by the trees
a crude grey light mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of thought
but you have not answered my question said lynch
what is art
what is the beauty it expresses
that was the first definition i gave you you sleepyheaded wretch said stephen when i began to try to think out the matter for myself
do you remember the night
cranly lost his temper and began to talk about wicklow bacon remember said lynch
he told us about them flaming fat devils of pigs
art said stephen is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end
you remember the pigs and forget that
you are a distressing pair you and cranly
lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said if i am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least another cigarette
i donot care about it
i donot even care about women
damn you and damn everything
i want a job of five hundred a year
you canot get me one
stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes
lynch took the last one that remained saying simply proceed
aquinas said stephen says that is beautiful the apprehension of which pleases
lynch nodded remember that he said pulcra sunt qu visa placent he uses the word visa said stephen to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension
this word though it is vague is clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing
it means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis
how about the true
it produces also a stasis of the mind
you would not write your name in pencil across the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle
no said lynch give me the hypothenuse of the venus of praxiteles
static therefore said stephen
plato i believe said that beauty is the splendour of truth
i donot think that it has a meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin
truth is beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible
the first step in the direction of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself to comprehend the act itself of intellection entire system of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that i think rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject
the first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension
is that clear
but what is beauty asked lynch impatiently
out with another definition
something we see and like
is that the best you and aquinas can do
let us take woman said stephen
let us take her said lynch fervently
the greek the turk the chinese the copt the hottentot said stephen all admire a different type of female beauty
that seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape
i see however two ways out
one is this hypothesis that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species
it may be so
the world it seems is drearier than even you lynch imagined
for my part i dislike that way out
it leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic
it leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where with one hand on the origin of species and the other hand on the new testament tells you that you admired the great flanks of venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours
then is a sulphuryellow liar said lynch energetically
there remains another way out said stephen laughing
to wit said lynch
this hypothesis stephen began
a long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of sir patrick hospital covering the end of speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal
lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed
then he turned on his heel rudely
stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companions illhumour had had its vent
this hypothesis stephen repeated is the other way out that though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people all people who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension
these relations of the sensible visible to you through one form and to me through another must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty
now we can return to our old friend saint thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom
lynch laughed
it amuses me vastly he said to hear you quoting him time after time like a jolly round friar
are you laughing in your sleeve answered stephen would call my esthetic theory applied aquinas
so far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends aquinas will carry me all along the line
when we come to the phenomena of artistic conception artistic gestation and artistic reproduction i require a new terminology and a new personal experience
of course said lynch
after all aquinas in spite of his intellect was exactly a good round friar
but you will tell me about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day
hurry up and finish the first part
who knows said stephen smiling
perhaps aquinas would understand me better than you
he was a poet himself
he wrote a hymn for maundy thursday
it begins with the words pange lingua gloriosi they say it is the highest glory of the hymnal
it is an intricate and soothing hymn
i like it but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song the vexilla regis of venantius fortunatus
lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice inpleta sunt qu concinit david fideli carmine dicendo nationibus regnavit a ligno deus great he said well pleased
great music
they turned into lower mount street
a few steps from the corner a fat young man wearing a silk neckcloth saluted them and stopped
did you hear the results of the exams he asked
griffin was plucked
halpin and oflynn are through the home civil
moonan got fifth place in the indian
oshaughnessy got fourteenth
the irish fellows in gave them a feed last night
they all ate curry
his pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and as he had advanced through his tidings of success his small fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing
in reply to a question of his eyes and his voice came forth again from their lurkingplaces
yes and he said taking pure mathematics and taking constitutional history
there are twenty subjects taking botany too
you know a member of the field club
he drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth
bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out said stephen drily to make a stew
the fat student laughed indulgently and said we are all highly respectable people in the field club
last saturday we went out to glenmalure seven of us
with women donovan said lynch
donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said our end is the acquisition of knowledge
then he said quickly hear you are writing some essays about esthetics
stephen made a vague gesture of denial
goethe and lessing said donovan have written a lot on that subject the classical school and the romantic school and all that
the laocoon interested me very much when i read it
of course it is idealistic german ultraprofound
neither of the others spoke
donovan took leave of them urbanely must go he said softly and benevolently i have a strong suspicion amounting almost to a conviction that my sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the donovan family
goodbye stephen said in his wake forget the turnips for me and my mate
lynch gazed after him his lip curling in slow scorn till his face resembled a devils mask to think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can get a good job he said at length and i have to smoke cheap cigarettes
they turned their faces towards merrion square and went for a little in silence
to finish what i was saying about beauty said stephen the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension
find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty
aquinas says ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur integritas consonantia claritas i translate it so three things are needed for beauty wholeness harmony and radiance do these correspond to the phases of apprehension
are you following
of course i am said lynch
if you think i have an excrementitious intelligence run after donovan and ask him to listen to you
stephen pointed to a basket which a butchers boy had slung inverted on his head
look at that basket he said see it said lynch
in order to see that basket said stephen your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not the basket
the first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended
an esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time
what is audible is presented in time what is visible is presented in space
but temporal or spatial the esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it
you apprehended it as one thing
you see it as one whole
you apprehend its wholeness
that is integritas eye said lynch laughing
go on
then said stephen you pass from point to point led by its formal lines you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits you feel the rhythm of its structure
in other words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension
having first felt that it is one thing you feel now that it is a thing
you apprehend it as complex multiple divisible separable made up of its parts the result of its parts and their sum harmonious
that is consonantia eye again said lynch wittily
tell me now what is claritas and you win the cigar
the connotation of the word stephen said is rather vague
aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact
it baffled me for a long time
it would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world the idea of which the matter is but the shadow the reality of which it is but the symbol
i thought he might mean that claritas is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one make it outshine its proper conditions
but that is literary talk
i understand it so
when you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permissible
you see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing
the radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic quidditas the whatness of a thing
this supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination
the mind in that mysterious instant shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal
the instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty the clear radiance of the esthetic image is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the italian physiologist luigi galvani using a phrase almost as beautiful as called the enchantment of the heart
stephen paused and though his companion did not speak felt that his words had called up around them a thoughtenchanted silence
what i have said he began again refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition
in the marketplace it has another sense
when we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art
the image it is clear must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or senses of others
if you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next
these forms are the lyrical form the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself the epical form the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to himself and to others the dramatic form the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others
that you told me a few nights ago said lynch and we began the famous discussion have a book at home said stephen in which i have written down questions which are more amusing than yours were
in finding the answers to them i found the theory of esthetic which i am trying to explain
here are some questions i set myself is a chair finely made tragic or comic
is the portrait of mona lisa good if i desire to see it
is the bust of sir philip crampton lyrical epical or dramatic
if not why not why not indeed said lynch laughing
if a man hacking in fury at a block of wood stephen continued make there an image of a cow is that image a work of art if not why not a lovely one said lynch laughing again
that has the true scholastic stink
lessing said stephen should not have taken a group of statues to write of
the art being inferior does not present the forms i spoke of distinguished clearly one from another
even in literature the highest and most spiritual art the forms are often confused
the lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope
he who utters it is more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion
the simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others
the narrative is no longer purely personal
the personality of the artist passes into the narration itself flowing round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea
this progress you will see easily in that old english ballad turpin hero which begins in the first person and ends in the third person
the dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life
the personality of the artist at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative finally refines itself out of existence impersonalizes itself so to speak
the esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination
the mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accomplished
the artist like the god of creation remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork invisible refined out of existence indifferent paring his fingernails
trying to refine them also out of existence said lynch
a fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into the dukes lawn to reach the national library before the shower came
what do you mean lynch asked surlily by prating about beauty and the imagination in this miserable godforsaken island
no wonder the artist retired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated this country
the rain fell faster
when they passed through the passage beside kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of the library
cranly leaning against a pillar was picking his teeth with a sharpened match listening to some companions
some girls stood near the entrance door
lynch whispered to stephen your beloved is here
stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of students heedless of the rain which fell fast turning his eyes towards her from time to time
she too stood silently among her companions
she has no priest to flirt with he thought with conscious bitterness remembering how he had seen her last
lynch was right
his mind emptied of theory and courage lapsed back into a listless peace
he heard the students talking among themselves
they spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination of the chances of getting places on ocean liners of poor and rich practices all a bubble
an irish country practice is better
hynes was two years in liverpool and he says the same
a frightful hole he said it was
nothing but midwifery cases
do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the country than in a rich city like that
i know a fellow
hynes has no brains
he got through by stewing pure stewing mind him plenty of money to be made in a big commercial city
depends on the practice
ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox simpliciter sanguinarius atrox in liverpoolio their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted pulsation
she was preparing to go away with her companions
the quick light shower had drawn off tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the blackened earth
their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade talking quietly and gaily glancing at the clouds holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops closing them again holding their skirts demurely
and if he had judged her harshly
if her life were a simple rosary of hours her life simple and strange as a birds life gay in the morning restless all day tired at sundown
her heart simple and wilful as a birds heart
towards dawn he awoke what sweet music
his soul was all dewy wet
over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed
he lay still as if his soul lay amid cool waters conscious of faint sweet music
his mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge a morning inspiration
a spirit filled him pure as the purest water sweet as dew moving as music
but how faintly it was inbreathed how passionlessly as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him
his soul was waking slowly fearing to awake wholly
it was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently
an enchantment of the heart
the night had been enchanted
in a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life
was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages
the instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or of what might have happened
the instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow
in the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh
gabriel the seraph had come to the virgins chamber
an afterglow deepened within his spirit whence the white flame had passed deepening to a rose and ardent light
that rose and ardent light was her strange wilful heart strange that no man had known or would know wilful from before the beginning of the world and lured by that ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling from heaven
are you not weary of ardent ways lure of the fallen seraphim
tell no more of enchanted days
the verses passed from his mind to his lips and murmuring them over he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through them
the roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme ways days blaze praise raise
its rays burned up the world consumed the hearts of men and angels the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart
your eyes have set mans heart ablaze and you have had your will of him
are you not weary of ardent ways
and then
the rhythm died away ceased began again to move and beat
and then
smoke incense ascending from the altar of the world
above the flame the smoke of praise goes up from ocean rim to rim tell no more of enchanted days
smoke went up from the whole earth from the vapoury oceans smoke of her praise
the earth was like a swinging swaying censer a ball of incense an ellipsoidal ball
the rhythm died out at once the cry of his heart was broken
his lips began to murmur the first verses over and over then went on stumbling through half verses stammering and baffled then stopped
the hearts cry was broken
the veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the morning light was gathering
a bell beat faintly very far away
a bird twittered two birds three
the bell and the bird ceased and the dull white light spread itself east and west covering the world covering the roselight in his heart
fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to look for paper and pencil
there was neither on the table only the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket singed by the last flame
he stretched his arm wearily towards the foot of the bed groping with his hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there
his fingers found a pencil and then a cigarette packet
he lay back and tearing open the packet placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the rough cardboard surface
having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow murmuring them again
the lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit smiling or serious asking himself why he had come displeased with her and with himself confounded by the print of the sacred heart above the untenanted sideboard
he saw her approach him in a lull of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs
then he saw himself sitting at the old piano striking chords softly from its speckled keys and singing amid the talk which had risen again in the room to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the elizabethans a sad and sweet loth to depart the victory chant of agincourt the happy air of greensleeves
while he sang and she listened or feigned to listen his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own sarcasm the house where young men are called by their christian names a little too soon
at certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain
she passed now dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball her white dress a little lifted a white spray nodding in her hair
she danced lightly in the round
she was dancing towards him and as she came her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek
at the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant a soft merchandise
you are a great stranger now
yes
i was born to be a monk am afraid you are a heretic
are you much afraid
for answer she had danced away from him along the chain of hands dancing lightly and discreetly giving herself to none
the white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek
a monk
his own image started forth a profaner of the cloister a heretic franciscan willing and willing not to serve spinning like gherardino da borgo san donnino a lithe web of sophistry and whispering in her ear
no it was not his image
it was like the image of the young priest in whose company he had seen her last looking at him out of doves eyes toying with the pages of her irish phrasebook
yes yes the ladies are coming round to us
i can see it every day
the ladies are with us
the best helpers the language has
and the church father moran
the church too
coming round too
the work is going ahead there too fret about the church
bah he had done well to leave the room in disdain
he had done well not to salute her on the steps of the library
he had done well to leave her to flirt with her priest to toy with a church which was the scullerymaid of christendom
rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his soul
it broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides
on all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoydens face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel the kitchengirl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of by lakes and fells a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near cork hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe a girl he had glanced at attracted by her small ripe mouth as she passed out of biscuit factory who had cried to him over her shoulder do you like what you seen of me straight hair and curly eyebrows
and yet he felt that however he might revile and mock her image his anger was also a form of homage
he had left the classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow
he had told himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood of her country a batlike soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness tarrying awhile loveless and sinless with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the latticed ear of a priest
his anger against her found vent in coarse railing at her paramour whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride a priested peasant with a brother a policeman in dublin and a brother a potboy in moycullen
to him she would unveil her souls shy nakedness to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to him a priest of the eternal imagination transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life
the radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant his bitter and despairing thoughts their cries arising unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving
our broken cries and mournful lays rise in one eucharistic hymn are you not weary of ardent ways
while sacrificing hands upraise the chalice flowing to the brim tell no more of enchanted days
he spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music and rhythm suffused his mind turning it to quiet indulgence then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing them then lay back on his bolster
the full morning light had come
no sound was to be heard but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises hoarse voices sleepy prayers
shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper
he tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers
weary
weary
he too was weary of ardent ways
a gradual warmth a languorous weariness passed over him descending along his spine from his closely cowled head
he felt it descend and seeing himself as he lay smiled
soon he would sleep
he had written verses for her again after ten years
ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air tapping her foot upon the glassy road
it was the last tram the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition
the conductor talked with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp
they stood on the steps of the tram he on the upper she on the lower
she came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down
let be
let be
ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly
if he sent her the verses
they would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of eggshells
folly indeed
her brothers would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their strong hard fingers
the suave priest her uncle seated in his armchair would hold the page at arms length read it smiling and approve of the literary form
no no that was folly
even if he sent her the verses she would not show them to others
no no she could not
he began to feel that he had wronged her
a sense of her innocence moved him almost to pity her an innocence he had never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it through sin an innocence which she too had not understood while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her nature had first come upon her
then first her soul had begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned and a tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor and her eyes humbled and saddened by the dark shame of womanhood
while his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been
might it be in the mysterious ways of spiritual life that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage
it might be
a glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all his body
conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep the temptress of his villanelle
her eyes dark and with a look of languor were opening to his eyes
her nakedness yielded to him radiant warm odorous and lavishlimbed enfolded him like a shining cloud enfolded him like water with a liquid life and like a cloud of vapour or like waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech symbols of the element of mystery flowed forth over his brain
are you not weary of ardent ways lure of the fallen seraphim
tell no more of enchanted days
your eyes have set mans heart ablaze and you have had your will of him
are you not weary of ardent ways
above the flame the smoke of praise goes up from ocean rim to rim
tell no more of enchanted days
our broken cries and mournful lays rise in one eucharistic hymn
are you not weary of ardent ways
while sacrificing hands upraise the chalice flowing to the brim
tell no more of enchanted days
and still you hold our longing gaze with languorous look and lavish limb
are you not weary of ardent ways
tell no more of enchanted days
what birds were they
he stood on the steps of the library to look at them leaning wearily on his ashplant
they flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in molesworth street
the air of the late march evening made clear their flight their dark darting quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue
he watched their flight bird after bird a dark flash a swerve a flutter of wings
he tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passed six ten eleven and wondered were they odd or even in number
twelve thirteen for two came wheeling down from the upper sky
they were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right circling about a temple of air
he listened to the cries like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot a shrill twofold note
but the notes were long and shrill and whirring unlike the cry of vermin falling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air
their cry was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spools
the inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mothers sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mothers face
why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch hearing their shrill twofold cry watching their flight
for an augury of good or evil
a phrase of cornelius agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons because they unlike man are in the order of their life and have not perverted that order by reason
and for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight
the colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur
a sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness a fear of symbols and portents of the hawklike man whose name he bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings of thoth the god of writers writing with a reed upon a tablet and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon
he smiled as he thought of the gods image for it made him think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig putting commas into a document which he held at arms length and he knew that he would not have remembered the gods name but that it was like an irish oath
it was folly
but was it for this folly that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into which he had been born and the order of life out of which he had come
they came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house flying darkly against the fading air
what birds were they
he thought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south
then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of mens houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander
bend down your faces oona and aleel
i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes upon the nest under the eave before he wander the loud waters
a soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters of oceanic silence of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing waters
a soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away lapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry and he felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly
symbol of departure or of loneliness
the verses crooned in the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the national theatre
he was alone at the side of the balcony looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of dublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage
a burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act
the catcalls and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from his scattered fellow students libel on ireland
made in germany
blasphemy
we never sold our faith
no irish woman ever did it
we want no amateur atheists
we want no budding buddhists
a sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the readers room
he turned into the pillared hall now calmly lit went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile
cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries
a thick book opened at the frontispiece lay before him on the wooden rest
he leaned back in his chair inclining his ear like that of a confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to him a problem from the chess page of a journal
stephen sat down at his right and the priest at the other side of the table closed his copy of the tablet with an angry snap and stood up
cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely
the medical student went on in a softer voice pawn to kings fourth
we had better go dixon said stephen in warning
he has gone to complain
dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity saying our men retired in good order
with guns and cattle added stephen pointing to the titlepage of book on which was printed diseases of the ox
as they passed through a lane of the tables stephen said cranly i want to speak to you
cranly did not answer or turn
he laid his book on the counter and passed out his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the floor
on the staircase he paused and gazing absently at dixon repeated pawn to kings bloody fourth
put it that way if you like dixon said
he had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a signet ring
as they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came towards them
under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur
the eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey
good evening gentlemen said the stubblegrown monkeyish face
warm weather for march said cranly
they have the windows open upstairs
dixon smiled and turned his ring
the blackish monkeypuckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred delightful weather for march
simply delightful
there are two nice young ladies upstairs captain tired of waiting dixon said
cranly smiled and said kindly the captain has only one love sir walter scott that so captain
what are you reading now captain
dixon asked
the bride of lammermoor love old scott the flexible lips said i think he writes something lovely
there is no writer can touch sir walter scott
he moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his sad eyes
sadder to ear was his speech a genteel accent low and moist marred by errors and listening to it he wondered was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous love
the park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and ever in the lake lying grey like a shield
a game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their greenwhite slime
they embraced softly impelled by the grey rainy light the wet silent trees the shieldlike witnessing lake the swans
they embraced without joy or passion his arm about his sisters neck
a grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame
he had loose redbrown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands
face
there was no face seen
the brothers face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair
the hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was hand
he frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth
his fathers gibes at the bantry gang leaped out of his memory
he held them at a distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again
why were they not hands
had simplicity and innocence stung him more secretly
he walked on across the hall with dixon leaving cranly to take leave elaborately of the dwarf
under the colonnade temple was standing in the midst of a little group of students
one of them cried dixon come over till you hear
temple is in grand form
temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes a hypocrite okeeffe he said
and dixon is a smiler
by hell i think thats a good literary expression
he laughed slily looking in face repeating by hell delighted with that name
a smiler
a stout student who stood below them on the steps said come back to the mistress temple
we want to hear about that
he had faith temple said
and he was a married man too
and all the priests used to be dining there
by hell i think they all had a touch
we shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter said dixon
tell us temple okeeffe said how many quarts of porter have you in you
all your intellectual soul is in that phrase okeeffe said temple with open scorn
he moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke to stephen
did you know that the forsters are the kings of belgium he asked
cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall his hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care
and heres the wiseacre said temple
do you know that about the forsters
he paused for an answer
cranly dislodged a figseed from his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently
the forster family temple said is descended from baldwin the first king of flanders
he was called the forester
forester and forster are the same name
a descendant of baldwin the first captain francis forster settled in ireland and married the daughter of the last chieftain of clanbrassil
then there are the blake forsters a different branch
from baldhead king of flanders cranly repeated rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth
where did you pick up all that history
okeeffe asked know all the history of your family too temple said turning to stephen
do you know what giraldus cambrensis says about your family
is he descended from baldwin too asked a tall consumptive student with dark eyes
baldhead cranly repeated sucking at a crevice in his teeth
pernobilis et pervetusta familia temple said to stephen
the stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly
dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice did an angel speak
cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger goggins youre the flamingest dirty devil i ever met do you know had it on my mind to say that goggins answered firmly
it did no one any harm did it
we hope dixon said suavely that it was not of the kind known to science as a paulo post futurum i tell you he was a smiler said temple turning right and left
i give him that name
you did not deaf said the tall consumptive
cranly still frowned at the stout student below him
then with a snort of disgust he shoved him violently down the steps
go away from here he said rudely
go away you stinkpot
and you are a stinkpot
goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place with good humour
temple turned back to stephen and asked do you believe in the law of heredity
are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say asked cranly facing round on him with an expression of wonder
the most profound sentence ever written temple said with enthusiasm is the sentence at the end of the zoology
reproduction is the beginning of death
he touched stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet
cranly pointed his long forefinger
look at him he said with scorn to the others
look at hope
they laughed at his words and gesture
temple turned on him bravely saying cranly youre always sneering at me
i can see that
but i am as good as you any day
do you know what i think about you now as compared with myself
my dear man said cranly urbanely you are incapable do you know absolutely incapable of thinking
but do you know temple went on what i think of you and of myself compared together
out with it temple the stout student cried from the steps
get it out in bits
temple turned right and left making sudden feeble gestures as he spoke a ballocks he said shaking his head in despair
i am and i know i am
and i admit it that i am
dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly and it does you every credit temple
but he temple said pointing to cranly he is a ballocks too like me
only he doesnot know it
and thats the only difference i see
a burst of laughter covered his words
but he turned again to stephen and said with a sudden eagerness that word is a most interesting word the only english dual number
did you know
is it
stephen said vaguely
he was watching firmfeatured suffering face lit up now by a smile of false patience
the gross name had passed over it like foul water poured over an old stone image patient of injuries and as he watched him he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown
she passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across stephen in reply to greeting
he also
was there not a slight flush on cheek
or had it come forth at words
the light had waned
he could not see
did that explain his friends listless silence his harsh comments the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often ardent wayward confessions
stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in himself
and he remembered an evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray to god in a wood near malahide
he had lifted up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour
and when two constabulary men had come into sight round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime
he began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a pillar
had cranly not heard him
yet he could wait
the talk about him ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above
but no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes were sleeping
she had passed through the dusk
and therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell
and therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble
darkness was falling
darkness falls from the air
a trembling joy lambent as a faint light played like a fairy host around him
but why
her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound rich and lutelike
he walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the colonnade beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his reverie from the students whom he had left and allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of dowland and byrd and nash
eyes opening from the darkness of desire eyes that dimmed the breaking east
what was their languid grace but the softness of chambering
and what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering stuart
and he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines dying fallings of sweet airs the proud pavan and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in covent garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that gaily yielding to their ravishers clipped and clipped again
the images he had summoned gave him no pleasure
they were secret and inflaming but her image was not entangled by them
that was not the way to think of her
it was not even the way in which he thought of her
could his mind then not trust itself
old phrases sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like the figseeds cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth
it was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure was passing homeward through the city
vaguely first and then more sharply he smelt her body
a conscious unrest seethed in his blood
yes it was her body he smelt a wild and languid smell the tepid limbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew
a louse crawled over the nape of his neck and putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar he caught it
he rolled its body tender yet brittle as a grain of rice between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die
there came to his mind a curious phrase from cornelius a lapide which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by god with the other animals on the sixth day
but the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red
the life of his body ill clad ill fed louse eaten made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell
yes and it was not darkness that fell from the air
it was brightness
brightness falls from the air
he had not even remembered rightly line
all the images it had awakened were false
his mind bred vermin
his thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth
he came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students
well then let her go and be damned to her
she could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest
let her
cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily
temple sat on the pediment of a pillar leaning back his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes
a squat young man came out of the porch a leather portfolio tucked under his armpit
he marched towards the group striking the flags with the heels of his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella
then raising the umbrella in salute he said to all good evening sirs
he struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with a slight nervous movement
the tall consumptive student and dixon and okeeffe were speaking in irish and did not answer him
then turning to cranly he said good evening particularly to you
he moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again
cranly who was still chewing the fig answered with loud movements of his jaws
good
yes
it is a good evening
the squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently and reprovingly can see he said that you are about to make obvious remarks
um cranly answered holding out what remained of the half chewed fig and jerking it towards the squat students mouth in sign that he should eat
the squat student did not eat it but indulging his special humour said gravely still tittering and prodding his phrase with his umbrella do you intend that
he broke off pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig and said loudly allude to that
um cranly said as before
do you intend that now the squat student said as ipso facto or let us say as so to speak
dixon turned aside from his group saying goggins was waiting for you glynn
he has gone round to the adelphi to look for you and moynihan
what have you there he asked tapping the portfolio under arm
examination papers glynn answered
i give them monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition
he also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled
tuition said cranly rudely
i suppose you mean the barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you
god help them
he bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt suffer little children to come unto me glynn said amiably bloody ape cranly repeated with emphasis and a blasphemous bloody ape
temple stood up and pushing past cranly addressed glynn that phrase you said now he said is from the new testament about suffer the children to come to me
go to sleep again temple said okeeffe
very well then temple continued still addressing glynn and if jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all to hell if they die unbaptised
why is that
were you baptised yourself temple the consumptive student asked
but why are they sent to hell if jesus said they were all to come
temple said his eyes searching eyes
glynn coughed and said gently holding back with difficulty the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every word and as you remark if it is thus i ask emphatically whence comes this thusness
because the church is cruel like all old sinners temple said
are you quite orthodox on that point temple
dixon said suavely
saint augustine says that about unbaptised children going to hell temple answered because he was a cruel old sinner too bow to you dixon said but i had the impression that limbo existed for such cases argue with him dixon cranly said brutally talk to him or look at him
lead him home with a sugan the way youd lead a bleating goat
limbo
temple cried a fine invention too
like hell
but with the unpleasantness left out dixon said
he turned smiling to the others and said think i am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much
you are glynn said in a firm tone
on that point ireland is united
he struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the colonnade
hell temple said
i can respect that invention of the grey spouse of satan
hell is roman like the walls of the romans strong and ugly
but what is limbo
put him back into the perambulator cranly okeeffe called out
cranly made a swift step towards temple halted stamping his foot crying as if to a fowl hoosh
temple moved away nimbly
do you know what limbo is he cried
do you know what we call a notion like that in roscommon
hoosh
blast you
cranly cried clapping his hands
neither my arse nor my elbow
temple cried out scornfully
and thats what i call limbo
give us that stick here cranly said
he snatched the ashplant roughly from hand and sprang down the steps but temple hearing him move in pursuit fled through the dusk like a wild creature nimble and fleetfooted heavy boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then returning heavily foiled and spurning the gravel at each step
his step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into hand
stephen felt that his anger had another cause but feigning patience touched his arm slightly and said quietly cranly i told you i wanted to speak to you
come away
cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked now
yes now stephen said
we canot speak here
come away
they crossed the quadrangle together without speaking
the bird call from siegfried whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch
cranly turned and dixon who had whistled called out where are you fellows off to
what about that game cranly
they parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the adelphi hotel
stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of kildare street opposite hotel he stood to wait patient again
the name of the hotel a colourless polished wood and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain
he stared angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of ireland housed in calm
they thought of army commissions and land agents peasants greeted them along the roads in the country they knew the names of certain french dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents
how could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters before their squires begat upon them that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own
and under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes under trees by the edges of streams and near the poolmottled bogs
a woman had waited in the doorway as davin had passed by at night and offering him a cup of milk had all but wooed him to her bed for davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret
but him no womans eyes had wooed
his arm was taken in a strong grip and voice said let us eke go
they walked southward in silence
then cranly said that blithering idiot temple
i swear to moses do you know that be the death of that fellow one time
but his voice was no longer angry and stephen wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch
they turned to the left and walked on as before
when they had gone on so for some time stephen said cranly i had an unpleasant quarrel this evening
with your people
cranly asked
with my mother
about religion
yes stephen answered
after a pause cranly asked what age is your mother
not old stephen said
she wishes me to make my easter duty
and will you will not stephen said
why not
cranly said will not serve answered stephen
that remark was made before cranly said calmly
it is made behind now said stephen hotly
cranly pressed arm saying go easy my dear man an excitable bloody man do you know
he laughed nervously as he spoke and looking up into face with moved and friendly eyes said do you know that you are an excitable man daresay i am said stephen laughing also
their minds lately estranged seemed suddenly to have been drawn closer one to the other
do you believe in the eucharist
cranly asked do not stephen said
do you disbelieve then neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it stephen answered
many persons have doubts even religious persons yet they overcome them or put them aside cranly said
are your doubts on that point too strong do not wish to overcome them stephen answered
cranly embarrassed for a moment took another fig from his pocket and was about to eat it when stephen said please
you cannot discuss this question with your mouth full of chewed fig cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted
then he smelt it with both nostrils bit a tiny piece spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter
addressing it as it lay he said depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire
taking arm he went on again and said do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of judgement
what is offered me on the other hand
stephen asked
an eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies
remember cranly said that he would be glorified
ay stephen said somewhat bitterly bright agile impassible and above all subtle
it is a curious thing do you know cranly said dispassionately how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve
did you believe in it when you were at school
i bet you did did stephen answered
and were you happier then
cranly asked softly happier than you are now for instance
often happy stephen said and often unhappy
i was someone else then
how someone else
what do you mean by that statement mean said stephen that i was not myself as i am now as i had to become
not as you are now not as you had to become cranly repeated
let me ask you a question
do you love your mother
stephen shook his head slowly donot know what your words mean he said simply
have you never loved anyone
cranly asked
do you mean women am not speaking of that cranly said in a colder tone
i ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything
stephen walked on beside his friend staring gloomily at the footpath tried to love god he said at length
it seems now i failed
it is very difficult
i tried to unite my will with the will of god instant by instant
in that i did not always fail
i could perhaps do that still
cranly cut him short by asking has your mother had a happy life
how do i know
stephen said
how many children had she
nine or ten stephen answered
some died
was your father
cranly interrupted himself for an instant and then said i donot want to pry into your family affairs
but was your father what is called welltodo
i mean when you were growing up
yes stephen said
what was he
cranly asked after a pause
stephen began to enumerate glibly his fathers attributes medical student an oarsman a tenor an amateur actor a shouting politician a small landlord a small investor a drinker a good fellow a storyteller somebodys secretary something in a distillery a taxgatherer a bankrupt and at present a praiser of his own past
cranly laughed tightening his grip on arm and said the distillery is damn good
is there anything else you want to know
stephen asked
are you in good circumstances at present
do i look it
stephen asked bluntly
so then cranly went on musingly you were born in the lap of luxury
he used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand that they were used by him without conviction
your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffering he said then
would you not try to save her from suffering more even if or would you
if i could stephen said that would cost me very little
then do so cranly said
do as she wishes you to do
what is it for you
you disbelieve in it
it is a form nothing else
and you will set her mind at rest
he ceased and as stephen did not reply remained silent
then as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought he said whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mothers love is not
your mother brings you into the world carries you first in her body
what do we know about what she feels
but whatever she feels it at least must be real
it must be
what are our ideas or ambitions
play
ideas
why that bloody bleating goat temple has ideas has ideas too
every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas
stephen who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words said with assumed carelessness pascal if i remember rightly would not suffer his mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex
pascal was a pig said cranly
aloysius gonzaga i think was of the same mind stephen said
and he was another pig then said cranly
the church calls him a saint stephen objected donot care a flaming damn what anyone calls him cranly said rudely and flatly
i call him a pig
stephen preparing the words neatly in his mind continued jesus too seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy in public but suarez a jesuit theologian and spanish gentleman has apologised for him
did the idea ever occur to you cranly asked that jesus was not what he pretended to be
the first person to whom that idea occurred stephen answered was jesus himself mean cranly said hardening in his speech did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite what he called the jews of his time a whited sepulchre
or to put it more plainly that he was a blackguard
that idea never occurred to me stephen answered
but i am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself
he turned towards his friends face and saw there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant
cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone tell me the truth
were you at all shocked by what i said
somewhat stephen said
and why were you shocked cranly pressed on in the same tone if you feel sure that our religion is false and that jesus was not the son of god am not at all sure of it stephen said
he is more like a son of god than a son of mary
and is that why you will not communicate cranly asked because you are not sure of that too because you feel that the host too may be the body and blood of the son of god and not a wafer of bread
and because you fear that it may be
yes stephen said quietly i feel that and i also fear it see cranly said
stephen struck by his tone of closure reopened the discussion at once by saying fear many things dogs horses firearms the sea thunderstorms machinery the country roads at night
but why do you fear a bit of bread imagine stephen said that there is a malevolent reality behind those things i say i fear
do you fear then cranly asked that the god of the roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious communion
the god of the roman catholics could do that now stephen said
i fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration
would you cranly asked in extreme danger commit that particular sacrilege
for instance if you lived in the penal days cannot answer for the past stephen replied
possibly not
then said cranly you do not intend to become a protestant said that i had lost the faith stephen answered but not that i had lost selfrespect
what kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent
they had walked on towards the township of pembroke and now as they went on slowly along the avenues the trees and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds
the air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their neediness
behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she sharpened knives
she sang in short broken bars rosie cranly stopped to listen saying mulier cantat the soft beauty of the latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a womans hand
the strife of their minds was quelled
the figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the darkness a whiterobed figure small and slender as a boy and with a falling girdle
her voice frail and high as a boys was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion et tu cum jesu galilo eras and all hearts were touched and turned to her voice shining like a young star shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence died
the singing ceased
they went on together cranly repeating in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain and when we are married how happy well be for i love sweet rosie ogrady and rosie ogrady loves me real poetry for you he said real love
he glanced sideways at stephen with a strange smile and said do you consider that poetry
or do you know what the words mean want to see rosie first said stephen easy to find cranly said
his hat had come down on his forehead
he shoved it back and in the shadow of the trees stephen saw his pale face framed by the dark and his large dark eyes
yes
his face was handsome and his body was strong and hard
he had spoken of a mothers love
he felt then the sufferings of women the weaknesses of their bodies and souls and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them
away then it is time to go
a voice spoke softly to lonely heart bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end
yes he would go
he could not strive against another
he knew his part
probably i shall go away he said
where
cranly asked
where i can stephen said
yes cranly said
it might be difficult for you to live here now
but is it that makes you go have to go stephen answered
because cranly continued you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw
there are many good believers who think as you do
would that surprise you
the church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas
it is the whole mass of those born into it
i donot know what you wish to do in life
is it what you told me the night we were standing outside harcourt street station
yes stephen said smiling in spite of himself at way of remembering thoughts in connexion with places
the night you spent half an hour wrangling with doherty about the shortest way from sallygap to larras
pothead
cranly said with calm contempt
what does he know about the way from sallygap to larras
or what does he know about anything for that matter
and the big slobbering washingpot head of him
he broke into a loud long laugh
well
stephen said
do you remember the rest
what you said is it
cranly asked
yes i remember it
to discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom
stephen raised his hat in acknowledgement
freedom
cranly repeated
but you are not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege
tell me would you rob would beg first stephen said
and if you got nothing would you rob
you wish me to say stephen answered that the rights of property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful to rob
everyone would act in that belief
so i will not make you that answer
apply to the jesuit theologian juan mariana de talavera who will also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow
ask me rather would i suffer others to rob me or if they did would i call down upon them what i believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm
and would you think stephen said it would pain me as much to do so as to be robbed see cranly said
he produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth
then he said carelessly tell me for example would you deflower a virgin
excuse me stephen said politely is that not the ambition of most young gentlemen
what then is your point of view
cranly asked
his last phrase sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and disheartening excited brain over which its fumes seemed to brood
look here cranly he said
you have asked me what i would do and what i would not do
i will tell you what i will do and what i will not do
i will not serve that in which i no longer believe whether it call itself my home my fatherland or my church and i will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as i can and as wholly as i can using for my defence the only arms i allow myself to usesilence exile and cunning
cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back towards leeson park
he laughed almost slily and pressed arm with an elders affection
cunning indeed he said
is it you
you poor poet you
and you made me confess to you stephen said thrilled by his touch as i have confessed to you so many other things have i not
yes my child cranly said still gaily
you made me confess the fears that i have
but i will tell you also what i do not fear
i do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever i have to leave
and i am not afraid to make a mistake even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
cranly now grave again slowed his pace and said alone quite alone
you have no fear of that
and you know what that word means
not only to be separate from all others but to have not even one friend will take the risk said stephen
and not to have any one person cranly said who would be more than a friend more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had
his words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature
had he spoken of himself of himself as he was or wished to be
stephen watched his face for some moments in silence
a cold sadness was there
he had spoken of himself of his own loneliness which he feared
of whom are you speaking
stephen asked at length
cranly did not answer
march long talk with cranly on the subject of my revolt
he had his grand manner on
i supple and suave
attacked me on the score of love for ones mother
tried to imagine his mother cannot
told me once in a moment of thoughtlessness his father was sixtyone when he was born
can see him
strong farmer type
pepper and salt suit
square feet
unkempt grizzled beard
probably attends coursing matches
pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to father dwyer of larras
sometimes talks to girls after nightfall
but his mother
very young or very old
hardly the first
if so cranly would not have spoken as he did
old then
probably and neglected
hence despair of soul the child of exhausted loins
march morning
thought this in bed last night but was too lazy and free to add to it
free yes
the exhausted loins are those of elizabeth and zacchary
then he is the precursor
item he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs read locusts and wild honey
also when thinking of him saw always a stern severed head or death mask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica
decollation they call it in the fold
puzzled for the moment by saint john at the latin gate
what do i see
a decollated precursor trying to pick the lock
march night
free
soul free and fancy free
let the dead bury the dead
ay
and let the dead marry the dead
march in company with lynch followed a sizeable hospital nurse idea
dislike it
two lean hungry greyhounds walking after a heifer
march have not seen her since that night
unwell
sits at the fire perhaps with mammas shawl on her shoulders
but not peevish
a nice bowl of gruel you now
march began with a discussion with my mother
subject handicapped by my sex and youth
to escape held up relations between jesus and papa against those between mary and her son
said religion was not a lyingin hospital
mother indulgent
said i have a queer mind and have read too much
not true
have read little and understood less
then she said i would come back to faith because i had a restless mind
this means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through the skylight of repentance
cannot repent
told her so and asked for sixpence
got threepence
then went to college
other wrangle with little round head rogues eye ghezzi
this time about bruno the nolan
began in italian and ended in pidgin english
he said bruno was a terrible heretic
i said he was terribly burned
he agreed to this with some sorrow
then gave me recipe for what he calls risotto alla bergamasca
when he pronounces a soft o he protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel
has he
and could he repent
yes he could and cry two round rogues tears one from each eye
crossing that is my green remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what cranly the other night called our religion
a quartet of them soldiers of the ninetyseventh infantry regiment sat at the foot of the cross and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified
went to library
tried to read three reviews
useless
she is not out yet
am i alarmed
about what
that she will never be out again
blake wrote i wonder if william bond will die for assuredly he is very ill
alas poor william
i was once at a diorama in rotunda
at the end were pictures of big nobs
among them william ewart gladstone just then dead
orchestra played willie we have missed you a race of clodhoppers
march morning
a troubled night of dreams
want to get them off my chest
a long curving gallery
from the floor ascend pillars of dark vapours
it is peopled by the images of fabulous kings set in stone
their hands are folded upon their knees in token of weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go up before them for ever as dark vapours
strange figures advance as from a cave
they are not as tall as men
one does not seem to stand quite apart from another
their faces are phosphorescent with darker streaks
they peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something
they do not speak
march this evening cranly was in the porch of the library proposing a problem to dixon and her brother
a mother let her child fall into the nile
still harping on the mother
a crocodile seized the child
mother asked it back
crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do with the child eat it or not eat it
this mentality lepidus would say is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun
and mine
is it not too
then into nile mud with it
april disapprove of this last phrase
april saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in mooney and rather lynxeyed lynch saw her as we passed
he tells me cranly was invited there by brother
did he bring his crocodile
is he the shining light now
well i discovered him
i protest i did
shining quietly behind a bushel of wicklow bran
april met davin at the cigar shop opposite church
he was in a black sweater and had a hurley stick
asked me was it true i was going away and why
told him the shortest way to tara was via holyhead
just then my father came up
introduction
father polite and observant
asked davin if he might offer him some refreshment
davin could not was going to a meeting
when we came away father told me he had a good honest eye
asked me why i did not join a rowing club
i pretended to think it over
told me then how he broke heart
wants me to read law
says i was cut out for that
more mud more crocodiles
april wild spring
scudding clouds life
dark stream of swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their delicate flowers
eyes of girls among the leaves
girls demure and romping
all fair or auburn no dark ones
they blush better
april certainly she remembers the past
lynch says all women do
then she remembers the time of her childhoodand mine if i was ever a child
the past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future
statues of women if lynch be right should always be fully draped one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts
april later
michael robartes remembers forgotten beauty and when his arms wrap her round he presses in his arms the loveliness which has long faded from the world
not this
not at all
i desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world
april faintly under the heavy night through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move the sound of hoofs upon the road
not so faintly now as they come near the bridge and in a moment as they pass the darkened windows the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow
they are heard now far away hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journeys endwhat what tidings
april read what i wrote last night
vague words for a vague emotion
would she like it
i think so
then i should have to like it also
april that tundish has been on my mind for a long time
i looked it up and find it english and good old blunt english too
damn the dean of studies and his funnel
what did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us
damn him one way or the other
april john alphonsus mulrennan has just returned from the west of ireland
european and asiatic papers please copy
he told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin
old man had red eyes and short pipe
old man spoke irish
mulrennan spoke irish
then old man and mulrennan spoke english
mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars
old man sat listened smoked spat
then said ah there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of the world
i fear him
i fear his redrimmed horny eyes
it is with him i must struggle all through this night till day come till he or i lie dead gripping him by the sinewy throat till
till what
till he yield to me
no
i mean no harm
april met her today point blank in grafton street
the crowd brought us together
we both stopped
she asked me why i never came said she had heard all sorts of stories about me
this was only to gain time
asked me was i writing poems
about whom
i asked her
this confused her more and i felt sorry and mean
turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritualheroic refrigerating apparatus invented and patented in all countries by dante alighieri
talked rapidly of myself and my plans
in the midst of it unluckily i made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature
i must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air
people began to look at us
she shook hands a moment after and in going away said she hoped i would do what i said
now i call that friendly donot you
yes i liked her today
a little or much know
i liked her and it seems a new feeling to me
then in that case all the rest all that i thought i thought and all that i felt i felt all the rest before now in fact give it up old chap
sleep it off
april away
away
the spell of arms and voices the white arms of roads their promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that stand against the moon their tale of distant nations
they are held out to say we are alonecome
and the voices say with them we are your kinsmen
and the air is thick with their company as they call to me their kinsman making ready to go shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth
april mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order
she prays now she says that i may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels
amen
so be it
welcome life
i go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race
april old father old artificer stand me now and ever in good stead
