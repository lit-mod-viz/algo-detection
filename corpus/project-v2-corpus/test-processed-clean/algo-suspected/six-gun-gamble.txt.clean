By Rancher Joe Burnie was no hand with a six-gun, and his skunkaroo enemy, Ben Grute, was a gunman who was as sharp as a tack. There had to be a showdown, because Joe wouldn't run away even though his staying would mean death—and then, suddenly, Joe Burnie discovered other ways to be literally a fighter sharp as a tack himself. on the prod, was like a thunderhead riding up to darken the sun-bathed New Mexi¬ co hills. Dismounting where his pard and neighbor, Joe Burnie, was starting con¬ struction on a new adobe house, lanky Irishman wore a dark expression on his face and a Colt on his hip. Considering that Tim O’Mara was a man who wore a smile habitually and a six-shooter set dom, the signs were ominous. “Joe,” Tim grimly announced without preamble, “Ben Grute has shot an’ kilt our Hereford bull, an’ goin’ to kill Ben Grute!” Stocky, sandy-haired Joe Burnie was younger than Tim O’Mara, but more levelheaded and contained. He didn’t blow up, although he and Tim sweated and denied themselves equally in order to buy that blooded bull and six heifers. aimed to raise breeders and improve the small range herd they ran pooled on their adjoining spreads. Loss of the bull was a bard blow, yet Joe accepted it with cold- eyed calmness and customary grave deliberation while thinking it over. "This mawnin’,” Tim irately elaborated, rode up-crick to see after the Here- fords, an’ found a section of our fence pulled down. The bull was dead, over on side of the fenceline.” "How d’you know Grute done it?” Joe questioned levelly. "Whoinell else woulda?” Tim chal¬ lenged. “Them three pulque-swillin’ 'breeds who run mangy sheeps an’ cattle, while he loafs in Sierrita or rides gun trails, they wouldn’t’ve. Be¬ sides, Grate woulda wanted the fun of doin' sech a stinkin’ job hisse’f!” Joe Burnie looked at the stacks of cured 'dobe bricks, ready to form the house he and Judy Ward would occupy when it was built and they were married. Scowling uneasily, he looked back at Tim and stated, “You can’t go gunnin’ for Grute, Tim. a killer, an’—” “When crowded, I c’n be one, too!" Tim snarled. “An’ it ain’t your place to deal with him,” Joe went on “We know Grute nev¬ er had a chance with Judy Ward, but he hates my guts because she took up with me when I come here. Now that it’s been announced that Judy an’ me are goin’ to be married, aimin’ to raise hell with us outa sheer spite an’ meanness. why he kilt our bull, an’ so it’s up to me to handle the settlin’ up.” “Since yuh put 'er thetaway,’’ Tim grudgingly agreed, allow the first lick's yours. But how do you aim to go about takin’ it?” “Not with a six-gun,” Joe declared. ain’t no shucks with one, an’ wouldn’t try makin’ settlement with one if I was. -just what Grute hopes do, giv- in’ him a chance to kill me. I b’lieve in law an’ order, Tim, an’ so goin’ to the law an’ ask for an arrest of Grute, then ask for damages.” ask, an’ yuh’ll git nawthin’,” Tim snorted. “But go ahead. After yuh’ve wasted time, try Grute in Colt Court.” truculence forbade further ar¬ gument. Silent, Joe got his horse. His six-gun, a battered relic he never packed, anyhow, he left behind in his cabin when he and Tim jogged away toward the town of Sierrita. Packing a belt-gun in¬ volved risk of gunplay, Joe figured. He wished Tim would shuck his hardware. silence of siesta hour cloaked Sierrita when Joe and Tim rode in. As they racked their horses at one edge of the plaza, Joe glanced over toward the store where Judy Ward worked, hoping she hadn’t seen them ride in. Apparently she hadn’t, and Joe was glad, because he didn’t want to have to tell her why they’d come to town until after things had been settled. No use worrying Judy unnecessarily, he fig¬ ured. Poor kid, she’d had too many wor¬ ries, anyhow, since her father’d died— and she’d had to sell their little ranch to level the debts he’d left. Grute, pestering after her, had been her biggest worry, and she feared the man. Judy Ward wasn't the only one who was afraid of Ben Grute, who left his coyote spread for his ’breed hands to run while he stayed in Sierrita, gambling, drink¬ ing and rough-handling the dark-skinned senoritas. A majority of the populace feared Grute, who’d killed two men here on his own stomping grounds, and whose gun was for hire away from there. Strangers would hit town and talk to him, or he'd receive a letter, and then Grute would ride out. When he returned, he’d be well-heeled with cash and would make bragging reference to a gun-slinging job he’d done in Texas, New Mexico or Ari¬ zona. So folks in Sierrita had reason to fear Ben Grute. Walking over to the west side of the square, Joe and Tim looked into the office of Jose Garcia, a dealer in mohair, wool and hides. As a sideline, Garcia was a deputy sheriff, the only law in that part of the county. Finding the office empty, Tim said, be in cantina, an’ likely be there, too. “No gunplay, mind you,” Joe admon¬ ished. Tim grunted sourly as they headed for Entering, they found Garcia, his big paunch pressed against the bar, talk¬ ing to the lame owner. As Tim had pre¬ dicted, Grate was also in the dingy place. A glass of aguardiente at his elbow, a cigar between his thin lips, he sat over a game of solitaire at a table against the wall. A big devil who affected foxed buok- skin clothing and wore his black hair long and his six-gun low-and-tied, Grute looked up and sneered at Joe and Tim. Tim twisted his lips back at Grute, but Joe, ignoring him, stepped up to Garcia and said, want to swear out a warrant against Grute, there. He shot an’ killed our Hereford bull.” “Eh? ees thees?” Instantly un¬ happy and apprehensive, the deputy turned his fat face toward the man at the table. Taking the cigar out of his mouth, Grute spat, “Damn’ right, I shot the bellerin’ devil. Yesterday, on the way to my sheep camp, I heard snuffun, snortun an’ bawlin’. I rode up to find that Here¬ ford had busted down the fence an’ was killin’ one of my range bulls. When I tried to stop ’im, he come at my horse, so I shot the damn’ critter. I was on my own range, Garcia, an’ within my rights, an’ any sons wantin’ to say diffrunt can have their dealin’s direct with me.” "So make ’er direct by callin’ yuh a liar!” Tim erupted. “Our fence’s exter strong along yuhr line. I claim yuh pulled it down, then run our bull acrost onto yuhr range an’ shot ’im.” “Tim, I warned you not to start noth¬ in’,” Joe barked. “Peace, senores,” Garcia croaked. the law, command eet.” lust fired snaky eyes as he leaped to his feet, but he made no play for his gun—partly because of Garcia, but mostly because Tim was ready to fight. Grute never tackled a man who was set for trouble if he could avoid it. No matter what gunswift edge he held, Grute preferred to wait, stack the deck all in his favor and name the time for turning the cards. would Grute weesh to tear down the fence an’ keel your bool, like you say?” Garcia arched his bushy brows at Joe. “They ain’t got no proof it was like that,” Grute jeered. Garcia eyed Joe questioningly. His ex¬ pression bitter, Joe shook his head. Pat¬ ently relieved, Garcia declared, “Seence there ees no proof the bool don’t try to gore Grute, can be no warrant issued, an’ no arrest. You geet proof, I geet warrant. Meantime, I must bid you adios, amigos, an’ tell you to keep the peacefulness.” Garcia showed them a broad stern as he turned and waddled out. Watching him go, Tim growled, “Wal, Joe, I told yuh so.” “An’ tell you somethun, O’Mara,” Grute snarled as he stepped close to Tim. "Just because too yaller to pack a six-gun an’ do his own fightin’, it don’t mean you can horn in for him, call me a liar an’ get away with it!” As he spoke, Grute raised his left hand and shook his finger under nose, and Joe tried to step around Tim and get between him and Grute. Driving Joe back with a hard thrust of one elbow, Tim raged at Grute, “Damn yuh, stop shakin’ yuhr finger under my nose, an’ draw!” Simultaneous with the sounds of palms slapping gun-butts and leather, Grute lunged and drove the heel of his upraised left hand against chest. It was doubtful that Tim, even under the best circumstances, could have begun to have matched gun-speed. Now, stag¬ gered backward and off balance, caught flat by foul trick, he hadn’t the ghost of a show. His Colt had barely cleared leather when the blast of six-shooter jarred the cantina. Tim rocked back, teetered on his heels, dropped his Colt and pressed both hands against his chest. vacant¬ eyed, his knees suddenly buckled and he plunged forward to the floor. Through a little swirl of gunsmoke, Joe looked down at Tim, then up at Grute; eyes were glazed by sudden grief and the damning realization that Tim was dead. The wolfish, killer’s ex¬ pression on face maddened Joe. An animal cry on his lips, ignoring the Colt in hand, Joe sprang at him. Grute struck out with the six-gun, lay¬ ing the barrel along forehead. Blood gushing from a long gash above one eye, stunned, Joe dropped to his knees. “Next time we meet, you'd better be packin’ a iron, or give you a pistolwhippin’ you won’t likely live over,” Grute snarled at Joe as Jose Garcia and several townsmen came high-tailing in. “Madre de Dios!” Garcia cried, tell you to be peaceable!” “That loco O’Mara drawed first,” Grute grunted. Looking over at Cojo, across the bar, he added, that right? Speak up!” Cojo gave Grute a stare of dislike. But Cojo was lame and old, and thoughtful of his own welfare. Regretfully, Cojo an¬ swered, “Si.” Sleeving blood off his face, swaying on widespread legs, Joe croaked, “Grute tricked. Tim, Garcia. I tried to stop things, but Tim elbowed me back. Then, Grute pulled his shovin’ trick on Tim.” tried to stop him from drawin’ an’ gettin’ hisself killed,” Grute grunted as he went back to his table and picked up his drink. Gripping arm, Garcia led him doorward. Regretfully, he said, sabe theengs, but w’at can I do? Notheeng! So, better now you go away from Grute. I weel have O’Mara took to the onder- taker.” Joe moved through the crowd outside and cut across the plaza toward the doctor’s. From the doorway of the store where she worked, Judy Ward saw him. A dark-haired girl with a pulse-accelerating figure, Judy ran to him, crying, “Joe, are you badly hurt? hap¬ pened to you? What happened in the cantina Before Joe could answer, the doctor emerged from his office, his kit in hand. Seeing Joe, blood streaming down his face, he came toward him, asking, “Burnie, does anyone in need me?” “No,” Joe intoned. “Tim there, but you can't help him, Doc. That sneakin’ Grute killed Tim, an’ it was my fault!” Judy gasped, but said nothing as they went into the doctor’s office. There, pre¬ paring to attend injury, the doctor said, “Joe, if you want to talk, tell Judy what happened, go ahead." Joe told about the bull and subsequent events, then said, “So, y’see, Judy, it’s my fault dead. If been packin’ a gun, I coulda sided him. I shoulda listened to him in the first place, an’ known it was loco to run to the law. Now that learned that, it’s too late to do Tim any good—but not too late for me to try to finish what he started!” Such was bitterness, he didn’t even seem to notice it when the doctor stitched the gash above his eye. Now, while the doctor fastened a bandage in place, Judy caught hold of hand and gently protested, “But, Joe, death wasn’t your fault. If Tim hadn’t been carrying a gun there’d have been no gun- battle. If he hadn’t lost his temper in hadn’t elbowed you away, he’d not have been killed. So you see, Joe, it couldn’t be your fault.” “Mebbe not,” Joe bleakly conceded. “But if packed my six-gun, I could’ve at least’ve tried to’ve held up my end to¬ day.” “And Grute would have killed "you,” Judy said. what he wants. If he’d seen no safe chance against both you and Tim, he’d have waited until he created a situation to his liking.” “Yeah,” Joe growled, a-waited. He won’t quit, Judy, so goin' to get my gun an’ face the son an’ get it over with!” “Nonsense!” the doctor snapped. dazed from the blow and the shock of sudden death. You listen to Judy, man.” the matter of the bull bein’ killed.” Joe persisted. “And not a shred of proof that Grute did it illegally,” the doctor said as, with a meaning glance at Judy, he turned and left the room. Alone with Joe, Judy put her arms around his neck and kissed him. “Joe,” she begged, “for my sake, let Grute alone. hurry our marriage. After that, sure Grute won’t bother us any more.” plea, the unshed tears glistening in her eyes, and the urgent yielding of her young body in arms, broke his stubborn resolve. After all, Judy and the doctor likely were right, and a long life on a Sunday morning, some two weeks after Tim O’Mara had been buried in grave¬ yard, when Judy rode out to spend the day with Joe. Throughout those two weeks, he had spent most of his time rush¬ ing the new house toward completion. been able to do that because it was the slack season, and Ben Grute wasn't around to be watched out for. The day after shooting Tim, Grute had ridden off somewhere to do a paid job of killing. Judy was surprised to find the walls up and the window and doorframes in. Going through the house, she tried to be gay as she decided how she'd place the fur¬ niture, but her gaiety was forced. Final¬ ly, unable to pretend any longer, she blurted, “Joe, you must be careful. Grute returned to Sierrita yesterday, then rode on out to his spread. Garcia brought me that news, and said to warn you.” “So?” Joe grunted. "Then I reckon better go haze back any stock that mighta drifted to the fenceline. Wanta ride along?” Getting his horse, Joe led the way suddenly started shaking and his stomach began to roll over as the reaction of his first killing seized him. ward onto range, now, since he and Tim had been pards and Tim had no living kin. Riding through juniper and pifion, they came to a lush creekside mead¬ ow where a few steers grazed. Looking them over, Joe rasped: “Them Hereford heifers was here two days ago. Now, with Judy was better than an eternity in boothill. Joe yielded, groaning, “All right. But I tell you now, I don’t think waitin’s any good. Grute won’t rest until we’ve had ’er out.” gone, an' they didn’t just drift off by themse'fs. See them tracks?” Judy, white-faced, nodded, but said nothing as they followed the tracks of the six Herefords and a shod horse up out of the meadow and to the fenceiine. There, three fenceposts and the wire be¬ tween was flat or the ground, and the tracks crossed there. likely find 'em all dead over there," Joe snarled. going with you," Judy stated. “And don't tell me I can’t." Joe shrugged and they rode across the line onto range, following the tracks into a draw. A little ways along, it turned sharply, and they came up against a barrier of freshly cut timber that held Herefords corraled in the draw above it. don’t savvy this,” Joe muttered. wonder—” What the you doin’ on my range?" Judy gave an involuntary cry. Together, she and Joe reined their horses around and faced Ben Grute, who’d slid down into the draw behind them. Hands on hips, Grute eyed Joe balefully. “You know what doin’,” Joe answered flatly. “You ran my heifers up here so have to come onto your range, didn’t you?” “They huntin’ that bull,” Grute jeered. “An’, since you brung Judy along to perfect you, maybe she’ll help pay the fee for them grazin’ on my range. a buck a day apiece, an’ I Ag¬ ger they been here all the fifteen days I been gone.” “You ain't cuttin' no such rusty on me,” Joe stonily stated. Dismounting, he walked up and began pulling the brush aside. “Damn you, Burnie,” Grute snarled as he walked toward Joe, who faced the taller, heavier man with fists raised. “Since you’re too yaller to pack a gun, like I warned you to, an’ you got Judy here to ride herd on you, I reckon there ain’t much I can do this time. So take your damn' critters an' get to hell yonderly!” Lowering his fists, Joe turned toward the barrier. Grute hit him, then, his left fist opening the barely healed gash above eye, right fist slamming against temple. Lights and fierce pain flash¬ ing in his head, Joe went down. He gasped as Grute kicked him in the'‘ribs, rolled away and got up, weaving dizzily. He swung a feeble blow at Grute as the lat¬ ter charged him, and again Joe hit the ground. After that, Joe had no idea how many cutting blows he took, nor how many times he staggered up and was knocked down until he was unable to rise again. “Grute!” he heard Judy scream—and heard a rifle crack. Grute, one foot lifted to grind his boot- heel into face, jerked back as the bullet, from the rifle Judy had gotten oat of saddle boot, sang over his head. Grute drew his breath in sharply. The desperate expression on face told him that she would put the next slug through him if she had to shoot again. “All right," Grute barked. “Take your weaklin’ an’ get off my range. An' don’t think I ain’t holdin’ this ag’in you, you heifer!” Climbing out of the draw, Grute got his horse out of the scrub and rode away. Sitting up, Joe groaned, ain’t half a man. I don’t do nothin’ when Grute kills Tim, an’ now you've had to save my hide.” Lifting her divided skirt, Judy ripped off part of her underskirt and knelt be¬ side Joe, using it to wipe away the blood streaming down his terribly beaten face. “Hush,” she rebuked him. “Grute resort¬ ed to treachery to beat you, even though he’s larger than you. He tricked you, just as he tricked Tim and other men he's killed.” Helping Joe to his feet, Judy had to lead him to his horse because his eyes were swelling shut. Tearing down the brush barrier, then, she took to her own saddle and drove the Herefords back onto range as she headed Joe for Sier- rita and the doctor. two days before Joe could see, and two more before he left his bed in a hotel room in town. During that time, Judy laid off from work and attended him, and she was there when the doctor let Joe get up. Now, watching stiff progress around the room, the doctor said, “Joe, you’re a lucky jasper. Your cracked rib and battered face will soon heal, and then you’ll be as good as ever.” “An’ what good’s that?” Joe bleakly de¬ manded. “Joe,” the doctor counseled, picking up his medicine kit, think like that. become embittered against your¬ self.” When the doctor had gone, Judy came to Joe and put her arms around him. After lightly kissing his battered lips, she said, “Joe, honey, the doctor’s right—you mustn’t become bitter. Why, after you sell out here and we settle somewhere else, you’ll forget this.” "Sell out?” Joe laughed, and it sound¬ ed like cold wind blowing through a tomb. sell what Tim left, an’ high- tail? Not me, Judy. I ain’t got to the point where run away from Grute.” "But we’d be better off somewhere else,” Judy protested. “Would we—knowin’ that rabbited Joe shook his head. “Besides, this’s where I want to stay, an’ where I will stay—either on top of the ground or six feet under it!” “Then what do you mean to do, Joe?” Judy quavered. “Right now,” he answered, goin’ out an’ see to things on the spread. likely be back in a couple of days or so.” Telling Judy so-long, Joe got his horse out of the feed barn, eased himself stiffly into the saddle and rode out of town. Three days later, happening to be look¬ ing out through the store window, Judy saw him ride back in. Watching him rack his horse, she was relieved to see that he packed no gun. Since Joe wasn’t heeled, Judy figured that he hadn’t come in to have a showdown with Grute. have felt less easy, had she known that old single-action was in one of his saddlebags. Grossing the plaza, Joe entered the office of Nabor Andrade, lawyer and justice of the peace. There, taking the chair Andrade offered, he announced, want you to fix me up a will Andrade gave Joe a shrewd glance. The lines of determination around mouth and the dull tone of finality in his voice didn’t escape the lawyer. Heavily, he sat down at his desk and wrote, as Joe dictated, a will that left worldly pos¬ sessions to Judy. When the will was finished and signed, Joe arose and said, “You keep it, Andrade, until it’s needed.” “You intend to go after Ben Grute?” Andrade surmised. “Not exactly.” Joe smiled bleakly. aim to strap my cutter on, then go where Grute is. Trust that son to do the rest!” “Why commit suicide playing game?” Andrade demanded. “Why not challenge him to fight with rifles, or to meet you in the street, both of you with your guns already drawn That way you might have some hope of killing that spawn of Diablo.” Grute would accept any such challenge?” Joe hooted. “That cabrone —no,” Andrade sourly admitted. “But,” he added, “you have no chance against him any other way. Not only is Grute lightning-fast with his pis¬ tol, but he’s as sharp as a tack when it comes to pulling dirty gunfight tricks.” “Yeah, sharp as a tack,” Joe echoed. Frowning, he snapped his fingers suddenly, like a man who’d remembered something or had hit on a good idea, and exclaimed, “But his sharp trickery might be the hole card I need to give as a ha’f- way even chance in the game!” “How can that be?” Andrade wondered. He received no answer, because Joe was leaving the oifice. Watching him go, Andrade shook his head and wondered if Joe hadn’t gone a little loco, to think that he had a chance in a with Grute. As for that, Joe knew how slim his chances were. But the idea that had come to him did give him a little bit or a chance, and that was a lot better than none at all. So, pursuing that idea, he went from to the hardware store, bought a box of carpet tacks and then headed for Deputy Jose in his chair, the dep¬ uty sheriff and hide dealer straight¬ ened up when Joe entered his office. Wor¬ riedly, he said, “Joe, eet ees not good that you’re een Sierrita now. Grute ees over een an’ there weel be trouble eef you ron eento heem.” him,” Joe brushed worries aside. “Have you got an’ ol’ cowhide, one that’s no good, layin’ around anywhere?” Nodding, Garcia got up and led the way out to a shed in back of his office. Point¬ ing at a hide hanging on a hook, he indignantly said, "There ees a torn one some crook put een a bale I bought.” When Joe, then, opened his pocket- knife and cut a foot-square piece out of the dried, tough cowhide, Garcia was un¬ able to contain his curiosity, he begged to know, “ees eet for?” a hole card,” Joe told him. “An’ thanks a lot.” Watching Joe walk away, Garcia, like Andrade, was wondering if Joe Burnie hadn’t gone haywire in the cabeza. Had he seen Joe, as the latter went over to the livery barn and into an empty stall, Garcia would have sworn that Joe was as nutty as a pifion tree. Kneeling, he laid the square of cowhide on the floor, took the box of carpet tacks out of his pocket and began sticking them through the hide. A little later, when the hide had been studded with tacks, Joe left the barn empty-handed. Going back to his horse, he got his holstered Colt out of the saddle¬ bag and buckled the belt around him. That done, he made a cigarette and stood with his head thoughtfully bowed while he smoked. Tossing the butt away, then, he drew a deep breath, squared his shoulders and walked down the street to Cojo, serving two cowpunchers at the far end of the bar, scowled apprehensively when Joe came in. At his favorite table by the wall, Grute sat reading an old newspaper. Looking up, his eyes narrowed when he saw the six-shooter dragging at right hip, and then a hun¬ gry, wolfish grin spread over his face. Rising quickly, Grute said, "Burnie, I wanta see you,” and stepped over to the bar. “Well,” Joe grunted, “you ain’t blind, are you?” “You talkin’ up trouble?” Grute snarled. get it, if you don’t pay what you owe me for your critters grazin’ on my range.” with you!” Joe Burnie hooted. “Burnie, I warn you not to rile me, or force me to draw my iron an’ burn what you owe me out of your hide. So you’d bet¬ ter fork over the dinero an’ ride close herd on your mouth. Savvy As he spoke, Grute raised his left hand and began shaking his finger under nose. That was the move Joe had hoped for. Bracing himself, he leaned a little toward Grute and barked, “We both got guns, so stop the gab, an’ grab!” Grute, as they went for their guns, stiffened his left arm and rammed the palms of his upraised left hand against chest. For an instant, then, his features twisting, the fluid rhythm of his draw was broken and he jerked as though he’d contacted a wire charged with elec¬ tricity. In that split second, Joe got the break he’d played for—but it was barely an even break and nothing more. The guns of both men cleared leather and flashed flame and lead simultaneously. The only difference between them was that Grute, surprised and upset by the sudden realization that his trick to cinch a sure-fire kill had boomeranged, threw his lead away. His slug tugged at shirt, left a welt along left side. bullets, placed with cold delibera¬ tion, smashed chest. A horrible, shocked expression on his face, staggered by the force of lead, Grute dropped his six-gun and gripped the rim of the bar. Swaying, he tried to speak, but managed only a wet, grunting sound. That sound, then, became a hideous gurgle, and his hold loosening, Grute col¬ lapsed, his body wedging down between the face of the bar and the brass footrail. there staring down at Ben body, Joe suddenly started shaking and his stomach began to roll over as the reaction of killing—his first killing—seized him. Knowing what Joe was going through, old Cojo limped hurriedly along the bar and thrust a bottle of whiskey into hand. “Dreenk a big dreenk,” Cojo command¬ ed. “You be a-right.” The drink steadied Joe. stopped shaking when Deputy Garcia, who was followed by the doctor, ran panting into the cantina. Stopping short when he saw that Grute, not Joe, was down, Garcia beat his fat palms together and cried, “Thees ees ver’ good. Ai, bueno!” “And a good job of shooting, Joe,” the doctor said, after a hasty examination of the body. “But how did you beat his draw?” Before Joe could answer, Judy rushed into the cantina. Tears streaming down her cheeks, her relief overwhelmed her when she saw that Joe was still among the living. Crying his name, she flung herself on him before he could prevent it. “Ohhh” Squealing, Judy leaped backward. Red lips parted, she pressed her hands to her breasts and eyed Joe in pained bewilderment. Grinning sheepishly, Joe unbuttoned his shirt, untied a rawhide thong and pulled out the tack-studded square of cow¬ hide that had been tied over his chest. Offering it to Garcia, he said, “My hole card, amigo. You savvy now?” “Good gravy!” one of the cowboys who’d witnessed the gun-fight exclaimed. "So why the son kinda bogged down when he shoved you—he jabbed his paw on the p’ints of them there tacks!” Joe nodded. got the idea when Andrade said that Grute was sharp as a tack when it come to dirty tricks. So I dealt me that hole card, gamblin’ that Grute would try the same trick on me that he tried on Tim. all I wanted was an even break—but wonderin’ if you folks think it was fair on my part Holy smoke!” The doctor clapped one hand to his forehead. “He gambles his life for an even break, then asks us was he fair!” "But he wouldn’t gamble on marrying me before—” Inadvertantly glancing at body, Judy left her teasing sen¬ tence unfinished. Taking hold of arm, Joe escort¬ ed her out of Motioning to the doc¬ tor to come along, Garcia followed them. Outside, beyond the crowd around the door, Judy and Joe halted and the doctor and Garcia joined them. “You say thees so-poor sport won’t marry you, eh?” Garcia sighed and shook his head at Judy. “Ees bad. I like for to geet up a baile an’ dance een the plaza. A weddeeng would be fine oxcuse.” “Andrade could tie the knot,” the doctor added. “Not till our house’s finished,” Joe stubbornly demurred. Impulsively, unmindful of onlookers, Judy flung her arms around neck, pulled his head down and pressed her lips to his. It wasn’t a quick kiss, nor a cool one, either. As the seconds went by, ears reddened, Garcia became slack- jawed, and the doctor mopped his face with his handkerchief and whistled long and softly. "There!” Breathless and starry-eyed, Judy at last let go of Joe. "Now, do you want to wait until our house is finished, Joe?” “Momma,” Joe exploded, “that settles it! Doc, you an’ Garcia come need you for witnesses.” Grabbing hand, then, he lit out for Nabor on the run.
