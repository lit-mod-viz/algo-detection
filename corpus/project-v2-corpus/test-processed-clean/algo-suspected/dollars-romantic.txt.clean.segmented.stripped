dollars romantic william wallace cook along the black canon trail wesley whipple rode singing and when he turned into grand avenue he scattered his husky ballads the full length of it and on past the five points to corral in first avenue
he was always happy but he was always twice as happy when he had money to spend as he was when broke and with difficult times in prospect
now he had thirty dollars in his pocket the old reliable rabbits foot on his watch chain and a note from uncle wes under the sweatband of his stetson
the note was responsible for arrival in phoenix that bright sunny afternoon when all the birds were warbling in the tops of the cottonwoods along the town ditch and chaffering melodiously among the umbrella trees and oleanders of the courthouse plaza
for it was springtime and nesting time and there is a difference even in sunny southern arizona at such a season
blind fate always conjuring with a mortals affairs had made of that summons from uncle wes merely an excuse for whipple to spend two days on a trail that had a big town at the end of it after the monotony of three months spent in dressing down plates and hanging up stamps in the threeply gold mill the prospect of picture shows enjoyed with katie or mamie or lorena was not without its thrills
and there was all of thirty pesos with which to finance a period of pleasure in the city
true uncle wes had said in his letter sick and this time its so blamed serious i feel like i wanted my only relative handy
but then uncle wes was of the complaining kind and enjoyed his ailments
six times in three years he had called his nephew to town in the fear that he was already crossing the great divide but the shadow had passed and the great divide had receded from uncle sky line
and during these supposed crises whipple had acted as nurse without pay thereby saving the canny uncle wes many dollars which otherwise would have gone to some stranger
uncle wesley plunkett was a tightwad and knew how to hang on to his money
uncle wes had never lost any sleep worrying about his nephew so the nephew could hardly be blamed if he had no hard and fast apprehensions regarding uncle wes
nevertheless whipple had a warm and sympathetic heart
if he had really thought his uncle was critically ill he would not have come singing into town that afternoon and he would not have planned his program of innocent pleasures with such joyous abandon
but when an imaginative relative has cried wolf half a dozen times and no wolf has materialized what logical reason is there for thinking that a seventh summons should be taken in any other way than cum grano sjalis with a grain of salt as the saying is
so in a pleasant frame of mind whipple rode into corral
the bay horse baldy which he had borrowed from the superintendent at the threeply mine he turned over to doolittle in person
the proprietor of the corral did not greet whipple effusively in fact he wore a sour expression and stood watching with knitted brows while the newcomer unhitched a dusty suit case from the saddle cantle the matter lafe inquired whipple turning about satchel in hand to give the corral man a steady look
what means that fishy eye and forbidding manner
you owe me six dollars re turned doolittle frankly and some of it has been runnin for two years
this ainot no free corral and i canot keep things goin without the dinero
you got to pay up what yu owe or take your hoss some other place
sorry a heap i got to talk like this but business is business and i ainot here for my health
well well whipple pulled out his thirty dollars and subtracted six from the roll a little matter like that between friends your money lafe
lafe doolittle thawed immediately wasnot worried a mite he averred brightly but you know how it is
plunk is down agin he writes me lie is
the old curmudgeon is full o funny nations that a way false alarm too pesky ornery to kick the bucket and leave his boodle to you or any one else the one thing that keeps him on the turf canot bear to give up what hes got my uncle doolittle and that sort of talk doesnot set well donot care how it sets the truth never hurt nobody yet
this hull town knows that when plunk goes up the spout hell take the spout right with him
darn little youll git
bank on plunk to fix it somehow
a feeling of loyalty to his only living relative brought a hot rebuke to lips but he smothered the sharp words realizing in his heart that there was considerable truth in remarks
leaving the corral with his suit case whipple made his way to the hotel fordham
felix vannell the day clerk did not display much enthusiasm as he watched whipple approach the counter and pick up a pen
buenos felix said whipple in his friendliest manner
howdy in that little word howdy passed from friend to friend can be wrapped up all the pleasant reminiscences of the past a lot of present good cheer and a cordial wish for future joys
but all felix the day clerk wrapped up in it was a perfunctory recognition right off the ice
whipple hung the inked pen over the register and stared hard at his quondam amigo wrong he inquired
is it possible not welcome here mr vannell
are you trying to chase me over to the plaza got orders to chase eight dollars out o your clothes before ever allowin you to register here again
it seemed to hurt vannell to voice this ultimatum had you on the slate for those eight plunks ever since last fall sorry but you know pm only a hired man and donot own the place
why shucks exclaimed whipple
everybody knows i pay my honest debts
this is the first time been in town since last fall
he took out his twentyfour dollars and passed over eight of them to the clerk
now are we all right
the eight dollars worked their instant magic
all the frost vanished from the clerks face and manner
heartily he gripped the hand holding the pen placed the register more conveniently and sounded the alarm for wing loo the chinaman bell hop sure glad to see you babbled vannell
uncle off his feed once more eh
well heres hoping
hoping what queried whipple after carefully writing his name in the book
why that when plunk does make up his mind to kick off he leaves you all his dough but everybody says he wonot or any part of it
still were all hoping my uncle my mothers only brother youre talking about vannell whipple returned so you might use the soft pedal with me
i donot want his money
you could use it couldnot you
here was the old sirens song against which whipple had stopped his ears ever since he had been old enough to realize what money meant in this world
use it he echoed
say he stopped short however and did not finish
the enthusiasm that had rushed into his sunbrowned face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared
no chance he added
anyhow i couldnot be happy if i didnot stand on my own feet
same old room
sure handed a key to the chinaman
fifteen loo
fifteen echoed the careful loo awri
a little later in room whipple shaved himself took a hot bath and got into his best clothes which he had brought along with him in the suit case
all the gold mills in arizona could not have turned out a finerlooking amalgamator than wesley whipple as he stood clad in his best onceymore in the fordham lobby
he stepped into a telephone booth and rang up the home of mr galusha mingo
the head of the house answered and his warm voice chilled when he discovered who was at the fordham end of the wire
katie mr mingo queried whipple just a little unnerved by an intangible feeling that something more was wrong well as usual said mingo still distantly
he was only six blocks away but one might have imagined that he was six miles
uncle wes is under the weather again whipple went on and in town for a spell
but this evening is mine and like to make a date with katie to you will make no more dates with katie young man and the receiver fairly snapped thought you had prospects but come to the conclusion you havenot
you are always in debt youll never get ahead
out at the mine you pull down thirty a week but you never save a cent of it and you owe everybody in town
katie canot afford to waste her time
bang and mr galusha mingo hung up
whipple was staggered but only for a moment
his acquaintance among the gentler sex was not limited to katie mingo although his dreams were more about katie than any other
he called the boarding house of miss serena haskins and asked for miss lorena marlin only to learn that miss marlin was out of town
then he had central give him mr anson residence
as luck would have it miss mamie philbrick answered the phone herself and although her voice was courteous in the extreme there was totally lacking any quality of pleasure
miss philbrick was sorry but she had an engagement for the evening
compliments of hardluck muttered whipple as he replaced the receiver on the hooks and left the booth
a man was waiting for him one hathaway a custom tailor
he approached whipple in the cautious manner of a hunter stalking an antelope
hello hathaway called whipple
hathaway nodded
he was measuring the amalgamator with his eyes taking in every detail of the nobby suit which had been built in his establishment and for which as yet he had received only a payment on account a balance of thirty dollars on your bill hathaway said and you told me you would settle next time you were in town
well here i am whipple answered
this is the first time been in town since i got these clothes be here probably for two or three days maybe longer
before i leave hathaway but no that would not do for hathaway
he believed a bird in the hand worth a whole flock in the bush
whipple was a fine chap but his money had a way of getting away from him
he would like a little something on account
how about fifteen dollars just half of what whipple owed him
expenses were heavy and collections hard
hathaway would be very grateful to whipple if he could pay something
whipple was touched with remorse and gave hathaway all he had left sixteen dollars
then hathaway cheered and grateful shook hands with whipple and asked him to drop around and look at some new suitings which had just arrived
after this he blithely left the hotel
strapped murmured whipple sinking into a chair
all dressed up and no place to go but got to go some place or therell be more creditors here and have to stand em off and i certainly hate to sidestep a man to whom i owe an honest debt
by george he told himself jumping up go and see uncle wes not expecting me till late this evening but give him a surprise be safe with uncle wes
nobody with a bill ever calls on him
he left the hotel humming a song
his mood was not so exalted as it had been while he was riding into town but he was still happy in a subdued irresponsible sort of way
if he had to have more money uncle wes might lend him some and take his watch for security ten years ever since he had sold the letty lee mine for three hundred and five thousand dollars wesley plunkett had tried with considerable success to convince himself that he was a confirmed invalid
he was sixty years old and stood six feet three in his stockings running mostly to length and very little to breadth
some said he was narrow others said he was near but the majority said he was close
all these colloquial phrases hit the one mark tightfisted
his acquaintances referred to him among themselves as old plunks
this sobriquet harking back to the colloquial once more was derived from the word plunk meaning dollar and also from middle name plunkett
for ten years the old man had lived in josh boarding house on fourth avenue beating hopper down in his rates a little with each succeeding year on the score of being a steady boarder
so well did manage that his living had not cost him two hundred and fifty dollars a year nor had his amusements cost him any more
his only amusement consisted in patronizing quack doctors and in buying advertised tonics and nostrums
whenever he emptied a bottle he treasured it finally selling the bottles in dozen lots at five cents a lot
this bottle money kept him in smoking tobacco
among many queer ideas was his hatred of paying taxes
he would have had a small house of his own but that would have meant dealing with the assessor
he had chances galore to invest his money safely at a good rate of interest but the income tax would have caught him
his funds were on deposit subject to check but just where they were or how much they totaled no supervisor had ever been able to discover
the taxexempt feature of municipal bonds had appealed to him once but he had withstood the temptation to buy such bonds for he feared that the government would pass a law putting a tax upon them as soon as it was known that he had loaded up with the securities
it was five oclock in the afternoon when whipple made his call upon his uncle
the old man was reclining in a lazyback canvas chair on secondstory porch
on a table at his elbow were various panaceas in bottles an empty glass and a pitcher of water
the invalid was smoking a corncob pipe and looking very pale and feeble
he was too long for the chair and his feet in old carpet slippers stuck out into space from beneath the navajo blanket that sought to cover him
well said uncle wes extending his hand with a painful effort reckon this is the last time ever call you in from the pull a chair up close got to talk to you for a spell and my voice is so weak it wonot carry far
oh i guess youre not so bad off uncle wes returned whipple cheerily placing a chair within confidential distance and seating himself
what seems to be the matter now
everything answered uncle wes gloomily but the last thing to put a crimp into me is my heart
doc flickinger says last three months been right on the job watching me every minute
why paid him eleven dollars in the last two weeks
three months after that stop being an expense to myself and everybody else
first i want to tell you bought a place for myself out to the cemtery on ham plot and i got just room enough for one for five dollars
ham was needing money so i picked it up at a bargain
being young and more or less in love with life these particulars gave whipple a gruesome feeling wouldnot talk about it uncle weo he admonished
got to insisted the other reached a pint where youve got to be in the know about every blamed thing i want everything plain and simple no fuss feathers or trimmings
understand
prices are scandalous for things like that and i want you to keep down the cost
promise whipple promised hastily eager for his uncle to shift the subject having received the promise drew a long breath of satisfaction then refilled his pipe and lighted it
your heart would be all right averred whipple if you stopped smoking so much and if you cut out all that patent dope
uncle wes frowned got the darnedest notions he grunted
tobacco and the stuff in them bottles is all thats keeping me alive be around for three months doc flickinger promises me three months
maybe doc flickinger is wrong whipple suggested
why donot you get a specialist from out of town
and throw away good money huh came scathingly from uncle wes wrote doc mixinger of prescott and asked what hed charge to come down for a consultation
and what do you think he wrote back
five hundred dollars
robber
i offered him fifty and he sent back a postal card sayin die in peace
and by gorry thats what going to do
i wonot be trimmed in my last days never have been trimmed and i wonot let any specialist begin it now
three months bring it july fifteenth miss the real hot weather anyway
flickinger seems to have it figured out pretty fine whipple commented
he figgered it out for dan jipley jest like that he gave dan nineteen days and a half and dan kept the appointment on the dot
same with steve suffern
doc gave him five months and steve didnot disappint him
so i know got to hike on july fifteenth
but that donot worry me be cuttin off a bill of expense and always found that cheerin
hopper will take it hard i expect cn a pretty steady boarder here
you know how it was with me all the time i was prospectin in the hills i had to live on cottonwood bark and niggerhead cactus mostly
they was tough times
i had to skimp and save and i sorto got into the habit then when i struck the letty lee and sold out for a fortune i didnot know how to spend what i had
and thats kind of worried me
but the publicans by gorry and here uncle wes chuckled kept away from the publicans
no tax collector ever got me and no tax collector is ever goin to got three hundred thousand dollars all in the banks and not in the savings departments either
you re my only heir
if i pass out and leave the three hundred thousand to you by will therell be an inheritance tax to be paid
but if i give you the money outright as a free gift there wonot be no tax inheritance income or otherwise
whipple caught his breath
you you wouldnot do that uncle wes he exclaimed figgerin on it the only way to beat the tax collectors strain myself a lot to do that
but i donot allow to give it to you all in a bunch aimin to scatter it over three months making the last and final donation on the evenin of tulv fourteenth
this was overwhelming
uncle wes had never given whipple so much as a plugged nickel before
and now he was going to present him with three hundred thousand dollars call that mighty generous of you uncle wes said the nephew with feeling
only uncle i ever had and always thought a lot of you
i wonot squander the money invest it and make it grow no you donot
uncle wes barked at him fiercely
if you invest it and it grows youll be payin taxes
i wonot have that i wonot have a cent of my money invested and growin into taxes
get that straight one reason going to hand the dinero to you in installments
i want to watch you squander it and have the good time with it that i ought to have had and didn know how
you neednot squander the last installment because i wonot be here to watch
the final donation i want you to put in a bank in a checking account and jest draw on it for livin expenses
get the idea
here look at this
he drew an old wallet from his pocket and removed an oblong slip of paper
holding the slip for a moment he looked at it with fond greedy eves then with an effort he passed the slip to whipple
the latters fingers trembled and his eyes dimmed somewhat
it was a check payable to his order for one hundred thousand dollars certified said uncle es and you can cash it at any bank in town
spend it
i want it all used up in thirty days so you can come back to me broke and get another check like it on june fourteenth
then on july fourteenth you get the last one
but remember donot you lay out even a twobit piece in hope of gain
those are my orders
if you donot live up to instructions that first check will be the last one leave the rest of my money to charity some home for superannuated miners and prospectors if there is any such thing have thirty days to spend a hundred thousand dollars
show me how you do it
everybody says youre a great spender but i never learned the knack
i stakin you to a round of pleasure now go out and make a business of bein happy want you to be a gentleman about it i know you are an honest soul and that you have a lot of fine sensibilities inherited from your mother
your pa was short of ability as a moneymaker and some other things but you got an a inheritance of character from the squander that money in a genteel way but donot let one sou of it make anything through investments
report to me often in person or by letter you see fm aimin to spend my last days enjoyin your experiences
i never was able to get any fun out of the money myself so fm plannin to take my fun secondhand
make it snappy and if you throw in a few thrills youll oblige
when a man is packin for his trip across the great divide same as me a leetle excitement will make him forget the trip ahead of him and be as you might say soothin
as fm preparing to lay down life i want you to pick it up real life mind the kind missed
i faintly somewhere within the confines of the boarding house there sounded the musical notes of a triangle
uncle wes stirred restlessly goes the supper call he said
hopper charges four bits a meal for transients like right well to have you stay and eat with me but fm short four bits in change
if you happen to have it havenot a red uncle wes put in whipple but my credit is good at the fordham
your credit ought to be good anywhere with that paper i just gave you but the banks are closed and hopper wants cash on the nail
maybe youd better go to the fordham when the banks open you can begin to step high wide and handsome
i only wished i was able to trot along with you but its all i can do to walk from this porch to the dinin room
this heart of mine wonot let me exercise
help me downstairs and then you can go to your hotel and plan your campaign
if you put away a dollar of that money where it brings any interest remember youre done
whipple caught his breath once more
he was hardly able to realize his good fortune
as one in a waking dream he helped uncle wes out of the canvas chair into the boarding house and down the stairs to the door of the dining room
there he thanked him mechanically left him and drifted out into the bright beautiful afternoon
one hundred thousand dollars all his own
whipple was so dazed by it all that he barely missed being run down by a street car in washington street
a whipple came into the lobby of the hotel fordham five men arose from their chairs and advanced upon him
they had learned he was in town and each had a bill
one hundred dollars would pay every cent that whipple owed and while that was a large amount to an amalgamator earning thirty a week and with a thousand ways in which to lay out that meager stipend it was a mere bagatelle to a young croesus upon whom had devolved the pleasant duty of spending more than three thousand dollars a day for thirty days
whipple dropped into a chair while his creditors surrounded him and held out their statements of account
swayed by a spirit of mischief whipple mutely pulled his pockets inside out
gentlemen he said came into town with thirty dollars and it is all gone
five faces grew very long and then came some peppery comments
whipple allowed this to continue until it got on his nerves then with a flourish he brought out his certified check and held it under five pairs of popping eyes
however he went on tomorrow as soon as the banks open i shall have the money
spread the good news that monte cristo junior will be at hotel fordham at eleven oclock tomorrow morning loaded to the guards with mazuma and ready to meet all comers with a claim on him
money has a magic touch
long faces broadened and sour looks faded into genial smiles
the man the haberdasher the jeweler who had overhauled watch
coffee of the shortorder cafe and the garage proprietor with a bill for taxis all these nearly smothered whipple with their kindly attentions
one hundred thousand dollars
the good will mounting in a direct ratio with the size of the check reached heights that whipple found rather annoying
he was known to be a good spender whenever he had the cash or if he did not have the ready money wherever his credit was good
but the limit of cash and credit for a amalgamator was modest
the wealthy wesley plunkett because of his known character as a tightwad never had influenced the merchants in putting whipple on their books
now that had loosened in such a royal manner however every tradesman had cheerful glimpses of the nephew in the role of a princely spendthrift and they began laying their plans accordingly
wrenching himself clear of the enthusiastic group whipple went in to dinner
every one even the waiters had a smile and a nod for him
news of the cleck was traveling like wildfire
it hardly seemed possible that old plunks had reversed himself so magnificently but every one who smiled and nodded had seen some one who had seen somebody else who had feasted his eyes on that oblong square of negotiable certified paper
so the check was a fact and the quickest way to get a little of money was to be on a friendly footing with lucky nephew
later in the evening whipple found time to do a little sober thinking
in order to be completely strapped by next may fourteenth it would be necessary for him to spend three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollars every day
and he could make no investments all the money would have to go for a good time a period of pleasure snappy and full of thrills if the approval of uncle wes was to be won
the problem when considered at some length gave whipple a sinking sensation
on one evening the previous fall he had spent fifteen dollars and forty cents
this maddening round of pleasure had included taxicab hire a picture show a dance and then a little supper and katie mingo had been his companion
he had given that jamboree all the trimmings he could imagine even buying katie a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates
he had considered it a wonderful plunge and he recalled how katie had gently reproved him for his extravagance
but that fifteen forty wasnot a circumstance to the obligations that faced him now
how in sam hill was he going to spend more than three thousand dollars a day for the next thirty days
it canot be done he told himself gloomily
all the pleasures i know anything about wouldnot cost me three thousand a month in this mans town
like many another man whipple had often dreamed of the fun he would have if some kindhearted genie would toss a million dollars into his lap
now faced with cold fact he couldnot devise ways and means for getting rid of one tenth of a million
he needed help
in a flash of inspiration he thought of concho charley vandeever
by george that was an idea vandeever was an oldtime friend of and his proud boast was that he never had anything more than a stetson on his mind
charley van was a cowboy
an aunt in the east had died and left him four thousand dollars
the moment he got the money charley van had excused himself from the ranch and in just ten days he was back at the tumbling punching cows again flat broke
that feat of concho had gone down in the history of the cattle country as a performance never before equaled it had even been perpetuated in a song entitled charley and the wad that wilted and so had been embalmed for all time as a lesson to spendthrifts
as soon as he could get to a telegraph office whipple sent the following message marking it rush charley vandeevef tumbling ranch prescott arizona
got to get rid of one hundred thousand dollars in thirty days
come on and help
at the rate of four thousand dollars in ten days supreme effort would have amounted to only twelve thousand dollars in a month
if that was the best he could do then whipple was leaning on a broken reed
nevertheless he had confidence in charley van
his experience would be valuable and there was no telling what prodigal heights he might not attain if backed with unlimited funds
the nimble fancies of a free range would suggest ways and means for pleasuring not to be found within the four walls of a gold mill
two heads were better than one in the emergency anyhow and there was nothing in uncle instructions barring an assistant spender
whipple went to bed that night in a fairly comfortable frame of mind
next morning at ten oclock he deposited his check in a checking account and drew three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollars and thirtyfour cents
he would try his prentice hand at getting rid of it before midnight
charley van could not possibly connect with the telegram and reach the side of his hardpressed friend before some time the following day meanwhile whipple could experiment unaided with his latent powers as a spendthrift
he had a chance to begin just as he turned from the paying tellers window
hello called a voice
put er there son been trailing around for two hours trying to find you
congratulations a chunky man in a shiny prince albert coat a slouch hat and trousers bagged at the knees stood in front of whipple and held out his hand
he was middleaged had gray chin whiskers and wore a pair of large tortoiseshell glasses
this person had the look of an amiable owl and his advances were more than friendly
doc flickinger exclaimed whipple taking the hand
erasmus flickinger by special appointment at cut rates physician in ordinary to that doomed and unhappy man your uncle
still clinging to hand flickinger pulled him close and whispered in his ear miss him but hopper eh
well such is life and we never know what minute is going to be the next
auricles and ventricles all shot to pieces and now theres a valvular lesion
july fifteenth along about three in the afternoon i should say will tell the story
how about a commission commission echoed whipple freeing himself and drawing back to look full at the sure went on flickinger always customary
if i hadnot given him three months you wouldnot be pulling down a hundred thousand a month the source of your good luck
ten per cent all right
you are barking up the wrong tree flickinger replied whipple coldly not handing anybody an honorarium for giving my uncle bad news
make it one per cent then begged flickinger
all i can pry out of old plunks is fifty cents a call
even it up for me
just a measly thousand for shaking this plum tree for you
fifty cents a call is about half a dollar more than your calls are worth
not a cent flickinger
this demand of yours is worse than unprofessional its an attempted holdup
with that whipple pushed on out of the bank
he had no confidence in erasmus flickinger even though he had developed some success as a prognosticator in a patients length of days
his gorge rose at the brazen demand for a commission on the misfortunes of uncle wes but out of his indignation there came an idea
making his way to the telegraph office he proceeded to wire five hundred dollars to doctor mixinger of prescott and request his immediate attention in the matter of wesley plunkett five hundred dollars plus telegraph tolls made cheering inroads upon the necessary disbursements of the day and whipple could not have spent the money for anything that would have contributed more to his personal pleasure
on his way back to the hotel attention was arrested by the fact that all phoenix seemed to know of his good fortune
somehow it had got into the morning papers
he bought one crossed over to the courthouse plaza seated himself on a bench and read the racy account of what must have struck the townspeople as a sevendays wonder
the heading ran whipple from threeply strikes it rich
young amalgamator at mine rides into phoenix and drops into a fortune
easy come easy go is the string to it
and uncle wes holds the end of the string
there on his bench in the plaza whipple leaned back in the shade of an oleander and smiled a little
was he becoming famous or notorious
he wondered and then continued to read wesley whipple more power to his open hand is said to be a spender
well has now the chance of a lifetime to prove it
he must spend one hundred thousand dollars a month for the next two months solely for his own pleasure and without making any investments that might bring money returns and then if he measures up to expectations there will be another hundred thousand dollars for him to put in the bank and draw on only as he needs it for living expenses
query will he develop such prodigal habits during the two months that his third hundred thousand will take wings and finally leave him stranded in mill with only his salary as amalgamator for a stake in life
the experiment will be watched with interest by the many friends of in this town
it appears that our wealthy townsman has discovered that he has only three months to live
mr as all know is an old prospector of frugal habits who turned up a fortune when he discovered and sold the famous letty lee mine in the harqua halas
ever since that time ten years ago he has been in failing health
he declares that he knows how to save money but has never acquired the knack of spending it for his own comfort and pleasure
so as his days draw toward a close he turns his wealth over to his nephew in liberal monthly installments to be spent at the rate of more than three thousand dollars a day in the quest of joy and happiness
and mr whose eccentricity is well known asserts that by this method he will be securing thrills and excitement by watching his nephew riot away a fortune must be flat broke at the end of his thirty days if he is not the deal is off and he will not receive the second stake for another jamboree of thirty days
and he cannot invest in anything that will bring monetary returns every red cent he disburses must go for comfort and pleasure and the question naturally arises how may a man of ingrained habits based upon the spending of a hundred or so a month blossom out as the regal spender of a hundred thousand a month
it looks easy but is it as easy as it looks
we extend our condolences to mr and to his nephew mr whipple also unless he can prove as the spendthrift days go on that he is entitled to congratulations
whipple was laughing at this story in the paper when he looked up to see a young man standing in front of him
mr wesley whipple inquired the stranger nicked it am carter wainwright of the ne plus ultra sales company mr whipple got a lot of money to spend and the right way to begin is by buying a ne plus ultra automobile
it will set you back twentyfive hundred dollars but will give you twentyfive thousand dollars worth of pleasure
six other automobile salesmen are waiting for you at the hotel but i have stolen a march on them by overhauling you in the plaza
now the ne plus ultra is the classiest car on the market today
it comes equipped with cord tires has all right mr wainwright cut in whipple take one you charge me more by throwing in a few extras
possibly
come over to the salesroom and well fix you up
by george enthused mr wainwright this is the easiest and quickest sale made since been in the business you caught me at what they call the psychological moment was comment
he arose from the bench the salesman hooked an arm through his and they started for the place where the ne plus ultras were to be had superintendent at the mine had a ne plus ultra car and whipple having a turn for mechanics had repaired it and tinkered with it and driven it until there was nothing about the ne plus ultra with which he was not thoroughly familiar
so he drove his shiny new machine back to the fordham and left it out in front while he went into the hotel and became involved in the designs of a greedy mob that filled the lobby and had been waiting for him
he singled out his creditors and paid them off
three gamblers led by montgomery king otherwise monte he summarily dismissed with the emphatic declaration that he was out to get a run for his money and not to enrich the card sharps
mogollon mike moloney a povertystricken prospector whom h had known for years and who at that moment was particularly down on his luck he presented with fifty dollars
four mining brokers with good things in which they wanted to interest him had their ardor dampened by the statement that he wasnot allowed to invest a point they would not have missed if they had read the morning papers carefully
at noon he went into the dining room for luncheon thrilled and cheered by the fact that in two hours he had spent more than thirtytwo hundred dollars and had only a trifle of eightyeight dollars and some cents left
he was making good by george
he hadnot found it difficult at all
by the time he had finished his noon meal another crowd had gathered in the lobby each member of it primed with suggestions for helping him get rid of his hundred thousand
evading these callers he dodged out at a side door reached his waiting automobile with a rush and a jump kicked at the selfstarter let in the clutch and was off for a ride through the countryside
the car worked like a charm and just to handle the controls and realize that everything from the headlights forward to the tail light aft was his very own caused him the most delightful sensations
his afternoon spin carried him out along the cave creek road around by the indian school and then back to town again
if only katie or mamie or lorena had been with him his enjoyment would have been complete
but which one of the three would he have enjoyed most to have along
ordinarily his answer would have been katie but pa hard jolt over the phone had rather dazed and discouraged him so far as katie was concerned
and mamie philbrick had turned him down courteously but not with any regret that he had been able to discover
miss lorena marlin had been out of town
in the absence of any disconcerting word from miss marlin he rather guessed that he would have enjoyed most her company on the little afternoon spin
in the lobby of the fordham the ranks of those with designs on his money had been reenforced by several newspaper men who were looking for a story
he refused himself to all of them after felix vannell had caught his ear and poured into it the information that three ladies were in the parlor upstairs waiting to see him
the wide doors of the parlor hung with portieres opened at the head of the first flight
as whipple came close to one of the swinging curtains a voice that was very familiar struck on his ear knew him first and hes mine by the right of discovery
you two may as well be on your way
that was lorena marlin speaking
her gurgling musical voice which had always seemed so cute and childlike to whipple had lost some of its rich cadence and was tinged with temper
he stopped to debate with himself and more conversation drifted out to him
you may have known him first miss marlin but when he called up last night and you had serena haskins tell him you were out of town i guess that let you out
oh i got wise to that
wesley will feel fine when he hears you were in the boarding house all the time and didnot want to see him
well miss smarty since you know so much tell you something that am wise to
he phoned to you yesterday didnot he
and you told him you had another engagement but you never had any callers and werenot out of the house all evening
so i guess were even
whipple was terribly shaken by this cross fire between lorena marlin and miss mamie philbrick
he had no business standing there and listening to it but he could hardly have avoided hearing disclosures
were these girls like all the others
had wesley whipple become popular with them merely because of the hundred thousand dollars
he drew out his handkerchief and passed it over his moist brows think you are just horrid both of you
here came a third voice equally familiar to whipple but vastly more pleasing
katie mingo was speaking
her tones expressed indignation and there was nothing in them of a spiteful quality
whipple clutched at them as at a straw of hope
a mocking laugh greeted words horrid are we returned lorena marlin
well how has your father been talking about wes whipple these last few weeks
nothing but an amalgamator and will be anything but an amalgamator
just a spendthrift with no eye on his future at all a goodenough fellow but lacks stability called on my katie for the last time if got anything to say about it how your father feels about wes whipple miss mingo and he has published his opinions all over town
step lightly my dear step lightly whipple thought it was high time to appear on the scene
he coughed flung back his shoulders and showed himself between the portieres
a cry of delight welcomed him and lorena and mamie sprang up from their chairs and hurried forward
katie remained seated by a window and did not join in the demonstration
lorena had black hair and black eyes and katie had flaxen hair and blue eyes while mamie was neither a brunette nor a blonde
all were lovely of feature and form but a flash of revelation had shown whipple that the characters of at least two of them were not so lovely
he bowed in his best manner
congrats wes cried lorena putting out her hand always thought your uncle would do something for you wes mamie remarked and isnot it fine how are you making it making it fly whipple answered
oh we knew you would exclaimed lorena in her most bewitching manner
you were always so generous wes and such a decided contrast to mr come to invite you over to miss haskins to dinner this evening
and here to ask you to our house to dinner spoke up mamie
and i was here first waiting for you wes
but i have known you longer than any of the others said lorena
you werenot out of town last night miss marlin and miss philbrick had no engagement
whipple could have made these statements of fact very cutting but it was not in him to be disagreeable to the ladies
he smiled as he spoke
so he went on am sure you will not be very much disappointed if i tell you that i have other plans for this evening
he walked over to katie
miss mingo he inquired why arenot you congratulating me thought wait answered katie
the truth is i donot know whether you are to be congratulated or not
time will tell about that wes
if the papers are to be believed the conditions under which your uncle is giving you the money may prove a handicap in the long run
father wants you to come to dinner at our house this evening
then he has reversed himself
his opinions about me have undergone a change since uncle wes proved so liberal
mamie and lorena tittered fair face flushed painfully
whipple was sorry at once that he had spoken in just that way
before katie could answer he went on suppose we take a ride in my new car and talk it over
just out around camelback mountain get you home in time for supper
he offered his arm
katie arose put her hand through the arm and crossed with whipple to the wide doorway
mamie had lost the power of speech and had dropped into a chair
not so lorena she seated herself quickly at a piano thrummed a few notes and began to sing
he voice followed katie and whipple as they descended the stairs katie be waiting at the door
oh dear gasped katie in charming confusion
never mind said whipple cheerily
it is a little hard to find out who our real friends are sometimes especially he added when one happens to have a hundred thousand dollars to spend
that money of uncle is going to prove a great education to me
they had a wonderful ride and not the least wonderful part of it was explanation of the way her father had reversed himself sentiments were never mine she told whipple earnestly know he has always thought well of you but he has had such hard luck all his life that he canot bear to see any one squandering money
and he has been in debt so much himself that it fills him with horror to see a young man starting life as he says completely surrounded with bills
he has watched you carefully for the last three years ever since you began calling at our house
you you didnot seem to improve wes and so he took the stand he did
after he talked with you i tried hard to get you at the hotel myself but couldnot
now worried for fear youll think like lorena and mamie inviting you to dinner because you have suddenly come into a lot of money
no katie never think that of you whipple averred never forget how i spent fifteen dollars and forty cents once and you called me down for being so extravagant
mamie and lorena were always urging me to go the limit different
well katie continued donot want you to come to our house to dinner tonight wes
father is desperately in need of ten thousand dollars and i know hes planning to ask you for it
if you come bless your heart not come cut in whipple
your wish is enough for me katie
but like to lavish some of this money on you if i can to buy happiness with it and i canot think of any happier way to spend it than to spend jt with you do wish you could save it wes save it and use it in getting ahead
it isnot right to throw away so much money
it was almost six oclock when whipple halted the car in front of door let katie out and then drove on toward the hotel
galusha mingo met his daughter as she entered the house
he wouldnot come to dinner he asked
no father answered katie brightly
you told him what i wanted
yes she answered dutifully
galusha mingo rubbed his hands
then you have planted the seed and it will grow and bear flower and fruit my dear
we shall see what we shall see
while he was uttering this oraculaf comment whipple was just crossing the street car track to drive into a garage
his work of driving was purely mechanical for his thoughts were all about katie and the delightful two hours he had just spent with her
he did not hear the jangled warning of an approaching street car and the first he knew of his danger was a tremendous crash
one side of the ne plus ultra doubled up and wrecked and broken it was rolled and pushed along the track
whipple himself had been thrown through the wind shield by the impact and was lying crumpled and unconscious in the street in front of the garage
it had all happened so quickly that even the crowds on the sidewalks were slow in realizing that there had been an accident
a awoke to find himself lyvv ing on three chairs in a drug store
doc flickinger was bending over him
both arms and one foot had been bandaged and flickinger was now decorating his face with courtplaster
get out he said to flickinger
fm all right remarked flickinger to the druggist and the druggists two clerks
as near as i can make out hes got a compound fracture of the tibia lacerated ligaments of both arms and very grave internal injuries
call the ambulance and well send him to a hospital
no you donot cried whipple staying at the fordham and thats where going right now
with that he got off the three chairs and started for the door
although he limped wesley whipple walked remarkably well for a man with a compound fracture of the tibia
flickinger chased after him wildly but he braced himself in the doorway turned and shook a bandaged fist under nose have some internal and external injuries yourself if you try to trail after me he threatened
flickinger was intimidated and fell back
hatless coatless bandaged and wearing only one shoe whipple turned a corner and walked half a block to the hotel fordham
the usual crowd of schemers was lying in wait for him but the sight of whipple in this gruesome condition was discouraging and only felix vannell and the chinese bell hop accosted him
for the love o pete exclaimed the clerk the matter accident said whipple but it isnot as bad as it looks
want a doctor
no all i want is to get up to my room
the chinaman helped him got him to his room on the second floor and would have continued his ministrations had whipple not ordered him out
then whipple locked the door and proceeded to remove the bandages
there was absolutely no need of them so far as whipple could discover
the compound fracture and the lacerated ligaments so feelingly mentioned by doc flickinger were wholly imaginary
whipple kicked the bandages into one corner of the room and aired his opinion of flickinger in burning words
he realized that he was shaken and bruised and that the glass of the broken wind shield made necessary the three bits of courtplaster that decorated his face
aside from this however he had suffered no injuries
being an athletic person and hard as nails as the saying is he had come through that accident remarkably well
a hand tried the knob of his door then the same hand drummed a summons on the panel
it was vannell and he brought a coat hat and the missing shoe
these were just brought to the office he explained shy fiftyeight dollars and a quarter felix said whipple
see if its in the coat
it was not in the coat and whipple was forced to the conclusion that when he was thrown from the car he must have emptied his pockets into the street
he still had his watch and chain and the rabbits foot charm and for these and for his wonderful good luck he was very thankful
vannell reported that the car was a total wreck that brandnew ne plus ultra which whipple had owned and enjoyed for only a few fleeting hours
but the situation had its amenities
whipple was cleaned out of every cent of the money which he had drawn for the days spending
he laughed jubilantly while the clerk looked on and wonclered if he was right in his mind
in half an hour felix whipple instructed send my dinner up to my room the clerk retired and whipple locked himself in again then he took a hot bath and greatly refreshed crawled into bed
when his dinner came he ate with a heartiness that in no way suggested the invalid
about eight oclock vannell brought him an evening paper and two telegrams
the clerk was off duty and would have liked to sit down and talk but whipple made it plain that he was in no mood for company lot of people have called up and asked about you said vannell galusha mingo among others
mingo gave orders that you were not to be disturbed and informed us that he is in charge of your case
that all right it was pleasant to know that father was taking such an interest in him
whipple informed the clerk that it was all right and was once more left to himself
one telegram was from doctor mixinger will run down friday and give your uncle my best attention
the other message was from charley van had been sent collect and was charged against whipple on the books of the hotel got you pard go out and take a view of the universe spend a red till i get there and show you how
will arrive thursday a m
whipple went to sleep that night feeling splendidly but he awoke next morning lame and sore and with an ache in all his joints
he tried to get up and dress but toppled back into bed again
it was borne in on him that he was doomed to take a day off and that his riotous spending would have to be broken for a interval
at the end of that time however charley van would be with him in person and there would be two heads to plan and four hands to scatter the largess of uncle wes
it was a quieting thought reflections had mostly to do with katie mingo during that inactive day
and he happened to remember that her father was in need of ten thousand dollars
it occurred to him that unknown to katie he might bestow that amount upon galusha mingo win his abiding friendship and get rid of more than a three days allowance of uncle money
galusha mingo had studied for the law only to find that he could not earn his salt as a lawyer
he had then given his attention to assaying and now had a little shop about six doors from corral
the business was not prosperous and mingo had a hard time to get along
he was a psychologist and he brought so much of the shadowy science into his business affairs that possibly the fact accounted for his failures
he had the faculty nevertheless of seeing good things in a business way and if he had had the funds with which to back up his analysis of opportunities he might have been a rich man
at the present moment he was very busy with affairs and oa wednesday afternoon about three oclock the angle of his activities was brought very forcibly and not very pleasantly home to the young man in room mr mingo called and with him there came a little sharpvisaged man who seemed deeply interested in the state of health
mingo introduced his companion as jules fortheringham a claim agent
the plunged at once into the business of the interview brandnew automobile was a total wreck
it had cost him just a few hours before the accident something like twentysix hundred dollars
it was a miracle as you might say that whipple himself had not been killed outright
seemingly he had come off extraordinarily well
he was feeling fairly well at the moment and yet who knew what might not develop in the days or weeks to come
mingo had visions of whipple walking with a cane or a crutch for the rest of his life
that was a possibility
the claim agent recognized the possibility and he was ready to give a check for five thousand dollars part to reimburse whipple for the loss of the car and the rest to in16 sure the company against any further claims
but i am all right asserted whipple and i donot want to goldbrick anybody
galusha mingo put up a restraining hand
whipple thought he was all right but time alone could tell whether he was or was not
disease resulting from the accident might creep into his system in course of time and put him completely out of the running
then again whipple continued to protest pm not so sure that the street car was at fault
i galusha mingo interrupted hastily to state that there were six eyewitnesses who would all swear that the street car was at fault
it is probable that heredity has less to do with this matter of being square than environment
the child of the most honest parents in the world will be marred for life if abandoned in the tender years to evil surroundings but he will grow up a credit to those who bore him if right teachings are sifted into his environment with discrimination and care
whipple in his extreme youth had been well grounded in proper principles and he now rebelled against the course along which mingo was hurrying him donot care about your eyewitnesses he said know that what happened was due entirely to my own carelessness
that settled it
jules fortheringham pushed a bundle of papers with which he had been busy back into his pocket
this frankness is er most unusual where a soulless corporation and easy money are concerned he remarked
who was the old chap who went hunting with a lantern for an honest man
he could have found his prize right here in room the fordham
he shook hands with whipple
son he went on as he moved to the door and paused there let me tell you something you canot spend or throw away a red cent without making an investment and the returns are bound to be made manifest in spite of yourself
just remember that
galusha mingo to all appearances was bitterly disappointed
he turned on whipple the moment they were alone together and vented his feelings
young man he said angrily you havenot an idea of the value of money
if you ever expect to get married what business have you got turning down a chance like that
less to yourself than to the lady who will some day be mrs whipple you are under an obligation to get ahead
on the chance that my little girl might somehow be concerned in your future plans i was trying to help you
flickinger made out as good a case for you as he could he was to receive ten per cent of the gross and i certainly pulled the wires for you in masterful fashion
now you have knocked everything into a cocked hat
he started for the door
katie is grieved over this orgy of fool spending mingo went on
she is a woman and takes to heart more than she ought to the deliberate manner in which you are shattering your future going to send her to an aunt in los angeles so she wonot be anywhere near this scene of criminal extravagance
i feel that it will be best
he jerked the door open but before he could leave whipple stayed him with a word am trying to give my uncle a little excitement and a few thrills in his last days mr mingo he explained as the other turned back
in that desk over in the corner is a check book and pen and ink
may i trouble you to bring them to me
mingo obeyed orders and whipple wrote out a check to him for ten thousand dollars
katie told me yesterday that you are desperately in need of this amount of money whipple went on as he passed over the check and i am glad to oblige an old friend
i would suggest however that you do not tell katie anything about it
she might not approve
mingo was touched almost to tears
til give you my note he said huskily
if you do fll tear it up
that is a free gift
i am empowered to spend the hundred thousand in ways that will bring me the most pleasure
looked at in such a way if the donation means anything to you it means infinitely more to me
my whole life turns right at this point continued mingo feelingly on behalf of my family and myself i thank you from my heart
are you still of a mind to send katie to los angeles
on second thoughts returned mingo believe leave that move to katie herself
thursday morning whipple was feeling much better
he was out of bed by seven and torturing his weary muscles with settingup exercises
the cold bath and brisk rub down that followed brought a warm glow and a feeling of exhilaration
the complaints of his dependable nerves and sinews were very mild indeed and only just enough to remind him that he had been in a collision
the patches of courtplaster of course still remained as souvenirs
he was busily shaving when something like an avalanche bumped against his locked door
he opened it and fell into the fond embrace of charley van me you old seed whooped the cowboy ready to take your little hand in mine and go out and put some fancy crimps in the big wad
things was gettin so monotonous down at the ranch that life wasnot popular at all
your call reached me at the physicogical moment as the man says
say honest i wasnot never in better trim to ramble around and scatter simoleons than i am this minute
but you ainot stringin me are you
if that roundelay youre singin is the goods why are you holed up in a jim crow room like this when you ort to be in the bridal suite
what you shavin yourself for when you ort to have a a barber in chief a hottowel holder and a bootblack on your pay roll
seems like theres somethin wror here
charley van was twentyseven
his eyes were brown and his hair was an auburn shade and had a tendency to curl
he wore a widebrimmed hat a gray flannel shirt and a pair of corduroy trousers and all these various articles of wear it was painfully evident had seen better days
if the clothes had fitted him they would have improved his appearance but the hat was at least two sizes too small while shirt and trousers were several sizes too large
whipple pushed his friend into a chair gave him a package of cigarettes and while the shaving proceeded explained about uncle wes and the money
he finished with an account of his first two days exploits as a spendthrift and charley almost wept over the good money gone with such a miserly return in personal enjoyment
gettin solid with the father of the girl youre aimin to marry by coughin up ten thousand perfectly good dollars charley wailed was about as locoed a play as any human ever put over ainot quoted at much more than a hundred a throw if theyre in the market at all
you been worked and i donot want you to get mad if i allow that moren likely the girl helped
but that pufformance star of its kind as it is ainot much behind vour fool refusal to accept five thousand dollars from the claim agent not at the receiving end charley said whipple apologetically a disbursing agent
and all as a disburse tell a man
uncle wes will probly get excited over the way that ten thousand went but gamble a blue stack he wonot be real thrilled
as i figger it youve only got about eightysix thousand left
now i got to revise my plans and sort o cut em down
how soon before you can stake me to a thousand and turn me loose for a few gay hours
you see i got into a game o draw cornin down from prescott and a tinhorn i played with corralled sixteen dollars that was in my clothes and then the clothes
what i got on was donated by a capper exceptin the lid and that i took a guy asleep in the smokin car guarantee to massacree a thousand plunks for you before noon if youll stake me then tord evenin well hop the fast train for los angeles
whipple started
why los angeles he inquired plannin to hit a place where we can get value received in untrammeled joy for every dollar we put out charley expounded wise to this game you see i been through the mill
what could we get for our dinero in this mans town providin we donot play the game of giveaway
nothin to mention
we want to go where we can hit the ceilin and even lift it a trifle
the blue sky for ours i ainot had no breakfast yet
how long before we eat and i corral that measly thousand eat now charley whipple returned and give you the thousand just as soon as the banks open
then well call on uncle wes and report
mebby i hadnot better go with you to see uncle wes charley advised mebby you hadnot better say a word about me helpin
he might get the idee that your money wonot last thirty days if mixed up with it
and heres somethin else suppose this new doc youve hired discovers that uncle wes has got thirty years yet instead o three months to be with us i wouldnot trust doc flickinger to analyze a case of distemper in a sick kyoodle if i happened to own the dog
if uncle wes is to be spared to live to a ripe old age said whipple sincerely it will make me happy
happy the cowboy jeered
say that old taxdodgin skinflint will be after you hot blocks to get back his money jest the minute he finds flickinger was wrong with his figgers have to do a fadeout before that happens
whipple was ready for the street and charley got up and looked him over with a critical eye
that automobile wreck didnot do a thing to your oufit did it he remarked
you need some glad rags yourself eat and then both go after the readymades
they had breakfast in the hotel and charley van sent six times for a fresh supply of wheat cakes
after the meal they started through the lobby on their way to the street but were blocked by another crowd of schemers with designs on money
the cowboy made short work of them and plowed his way through the press with sarcastic comments and a threat of using his fists
at an establishment where garments were sold they made their selections
the bill was four hundred and sixty dollars but it included everything from hats to shoes
each climbed into his new outfit and then a clerk accompanied them to the bank to make sure the bill was paid
whipple drew three thousand dollars settled for the clothes turned a thousand over to his friend and then they separated
where charley went whipple did not know but whipple himself made his way to josh boarding house to make his first report in person
uncle wes was sprawled on the same secondstory porch in the same canvas chair with the same bottles on the table and the same look of weary resignation in his face
then it didnot kill you after ail he remarked as he feebly put out his hand
my moneys a curse ainot it
i canot even pass it on to you with the curse wiped off
how much you spent
twenty dollars spent nearly fourteen thousand dollars uncle whipple answered without emotion
uncle wes furnished plenty of emotion
in fact he almost dropped out of his canvas chair
another shock like that he gasped and my heart will stop right here
fourteen thou say you never
well you wonot get no more out o me until next june fourteenth
you better be careful
i never spent that much in my hull life you do it
the old man filled and lighted his pipe and composed himself for a period of enjoyment
but he was disappointed
the thrills he was expecting did not appear
whipple said nothing about charley vandeever and dwelt only lightly on the amount expended for clothes
for reasons of a different nature he failed to mention the money given to mingo and the five hundred sent to doctor mixinger
his story had mainly to do with the new automobile and the way it had been wrecked never took no stock in them godevils anyways commented uncle wes ainot enjoyed your experiences any yet
what else you done you amuse me at all a lot more that hasnot been accounted for
whipple grew uneasy
my other expenditures for the present must remain a secret he said begin to find out about them tomorrow begun to find out about em already was the peppery answer
katie mingo was here to see me last evening
give her father ten thousand dollars didnot you
that ainot playin the game i was right warm about that when katie told me
the girls fine but her dad is no good
what you done worried me last night so i couldnot sleep
if i hear of your givin another cent away make you return whats left right
now you govern yourself according
i expected you to have some fun with that money and to pass the fun along to me
all got out of it so far is a bad night and all you seem to have got out of it was an accident that nigh killed you
if you donot do better well call off this hull arrangement
whipple placated his uncle as best he could but when he left the old fellow was still garrulous and peppery
at half past twelve when he got back to fordham he found a gloomy gentleman in a panama hat a loud and expensive suit of clothes and tan oxfords waiting for him
the gentleman was concho charley vandeever
had some hard luck charley whipple asked
worst ever the other muttered and began to pull money from every pocket of his clothes it plumb queer how whenever you want to lose youre bound to win
a gang headed by monte was aimin to trim you at onecalltwo
i told em you wasnot built for buckin the tiger but that i was your next friend with a first lien on your bank account and that they could lead me to the slaughter
well there was a killin believe me but the inquest is now bein held on threecard and his crowd
i went in with a thousand dollars and come out with six thousand in cash and i for three thousand more
toughest run o luck i ever had
say amigo i jest couldnot lose
ever time there was a jack pot draw five and have a straight flush ever time i held up a pair get the two that went with it and if i made a fourcard draw like enough find myself with a full house
gosh
charley van drew a pink silk handkerchief across his moist and wrinkled brow
hanged if i understand it he mumbled
serves you right for gambling said whipple severely
if you expect to clean me out with the cards charley youll find it isnot possible
now weve got just that much more to spend
well donot throw it into me pard begged charley
them i ainot worth a whoop and got a way to get rid of my winnins and to make a fairsized raid on your pile at the same time be a man here in a leather coat at two oclock talk business with him
who is he and what has he got a bird and his name is simmons percival simmons perce simmons jest like that or persimmons for short a flyer and out at the park hes got a threeseater aeroplane
he come here to start a passengercarryin service to maricopa or san diego or any old place but no one seems fool enough to pay him a dollar a minute to get to somewhere they want to go pretty near broke and all hes got is the machine
how about travelin to los angeles in style you reckon that would thrill uncle wes
how much will it cost to travel by aeroplane to los angeles inquired whipple
well i reckoned wed buy the machine and then give simmons a hundred a day to run it for us sell for sixteen thousand spot cash my six and youll have to put up only what you was fool enough to hand over to mingo
how does it strike you more fun than a barrel o monkeys to be had out of an aeroplane
always wanted to own one but it didnot seem possible on forty a month and a dozen ways for even that the matter with you
feelin faint yes whipple was feeling very faint
buying an aeroplane had never occurred to him possibly because the chance had not offered itself before
but high places always made him dizzy
even when he climbed the gold mill to put a few shingles on the roof he became lightheaded
but he had his heart set on los angeles if katie was going to be there and he and charley might as well fly as travel in the steam cars
all right charley he said buy it
charley van let out a subdued whoop of joy
in this day of science and invention he remarked spendin does come easy be stepping some as the man says
stepping from cloud to cloud added whipple wish to thunder charley we had the hard ground under us
oh itll be under us returned the delighted cowboy about two thousand feet down
a friday forenoon wesley plunkett was in a most unhappy frame of mind
dyspepsia was now added to his other troubles and he was trying a new medicine for it that cost him one dollar and fifty cents a bottle
in addition to this cost for the medicine he had been stung for some revenue stamps pasted on the carton which contained the bottle
he could not get over those stamps they struck at his heart and sent the badtemper poison pulsing through his whole body
he was in a mood to have a row with somebody just on general principles
at nine oclock fate sent him a visitor and gave him his chance
mr wesley plunkett a voice with a rising inflection was wafted to him from the doorway leading out upon the secondstory veranda
it was a sharp businesslike voice but uncle wes did not look around it to you he snapped
clear out and leave me alone a sick man and donot want to be bothered
he poured himself a teaspoonful of the new dyspepsia medicine and carefully lifted the spoon toward his lips
the next moment the spoon was snatched out of his hand and its valuable contents were scattered and lost on the navajo blanket and the veranda floor
uncle wes fell back in the canvas chair and glared
he tried to say something particularly fierce but his words hung in his throat
a woman stood at his elbow
she was a middleaged woman tall and muscular and mightily determined
she wore tortoiseshell spectacles and behind them her eyes seemed to glimmer balefully
her hat was a derby and she had on a collar necktie and coat like a mans
there was even something masculine about her skirt and the commonsense shoes just below the hem of it
she carried a small square satchel and her hands were large and strong seemingly very capable
now the only female who ever called on uncle wes was katie mingo
women uncle wes had discovered early in life were a source of extravagance and trouble
so he had denied himself to them
even katie calls were few and far between
in his wrath and indignation he had been going to swear but he held back the unseemly language
now youve done it he rasped
all of a dimes worth of my new dyspepsy dope gone to blazes
lady youd better hike or maybe somethingll be said that wonot sound well got to be cam and quiet in order to last three months
another shock like that you just gave me and liable to flicker out and not go the limit
you heard me i said good morning
good morning mr said the other easily and put her satchel in a chair and opened it
uncle wes saw that the interior of the satchel bore a faint resemblance to a bit of impedimenta doc flickinger carried only this outfit was more extensive and in better condition
uncle wes leaned forward restlessly
his visitor was not leaving but was making preparations to stay
darn it he whooped what i meant was goodby the strength of his voice rather surprised him that morning it was not as feeble as usual the idee of your stickin around like this
the woman had been bending over the case
she straightened erect with an object in her hand that had two rubber tubes hanging from it and writhing like a pair of black snakes
doctor mixinger of prescott she replied calmly and here to find out whats the matter with you
this was another shock to uncle wes
he gasped and gripped the arms of his chair
you canot run in no rhinecaboo like this he cried wildly know whats the matter with me and i wonot even pay you fifty dollars to make a guess let that trouble you mr said doctor mixinger already been paid the full fee if i hadnot been i shouldnot be here
now that i am here i intend to do my professional duty
i shall be pleasant about it unless you make yourself disagreeable in that event and here her features sharpened and her eyes gleamed am going to be firm and transact our business just the same
she picked up the dangling tubes and pushed one into each of her ears
who paid you
who sent you
uncle wes cringed as he demanded the information
mr wesley whipple
uncle wes went into a tantrum
so thats how whipple was spending his money he would tell him things next time he came to report
say ahhh said doctor mixinger quietly bending over him and pushing something against his heaving chest wonot say a blamed thing but whats on my mind barked uncle wes rolling his eyes donot want no lady doc fussin around me
i wonot have any doctor mixinger straightened erect and fire flashed in her eyes you call me a lady doc she admonished a lady and a doctor but draw the line at doc
now calm yourself and say here was a command and it was spoken in such a tone that uncle wes said ahhh again and again while all the time doctor mixinger pushed something over his chest and half closed her eyes and listened but while he was saying ahhh uncle wes was thinking in terms that were not pretty
finally the doctor smiled a quiet smile pulled the rubber tubes out of her ears and carefully replaced the stethoscope in the case all ainot it queried uncle wes eagerly
not quite was the answer
doctor mixinger pulled up a chair seated herself leaned forward and looked him full in the eyes
it was a probing look and uncle wes felt a shiver going through him
give me your left hand said the doctor
you ainot goin to hold my hand
i never yit uncle wes yielded his left hand and cringed again as the lady doctors soft firm fingers caressed his bony wrist mused the doctor sitting back a moment later and studying the patient with a speculative stare
uncle wes grabbed at his pipe and tobacco
savagely he filled the bowl and struck a match
how much longer you goin to stay he asked as he surrounded himself with a fog of vapor
just long enough to get you on your feet so be patient
who has been looking after you
doc flickinger
a faint smile showed at the corners of doctor lips
what does he say she inquired
he gives me three months
next july fifteenth sometime along in the afternoon a goner
what are those bottles on the table all that keeps me alive returned uncle wes sharply
does doctor flickinger prescribe that stuff for you
well he says its helpin
helping to kill you
doctor mixinger got up stepped to the table and lifted the bottle containing the dyspepsia medicine
she looked at the label removed the cork and smelled the contents then coolly deliberately she threw the bottle over the veranda rail and it smashed to fragments on the ground below the best place for that she observed calmly
uncle wes went into a flurry
he raged about the dollar and a half and the extra few cents for the stamps
while he was raving three other bottles went over the rail
he grabbed for the last one but was not quick enough
utterly beside himself with rage the old prospector jumped out of his chair and began prancing up and down the veranda now and then he would pause and look over the railing and moan at the sight of the broken glass and wasted medicine
say he quavered if i had a gun i surely would doctor mixinger drew a small gleaming automatic pistol from one of her pockets
you havenot one handy she said
well i always make a practice of carrying one
you see i have to travel a good deal and meet all kinds of people
sit down mr
the automatic was pointed carelessly in the general direction of uncle wes
he grew quiet instantly and slumped into his chair again
how long have you been like this went on the doctor
uncle wes moistened his lips with his tongue and tried twice before he could answer then he managed to say ten years
ten years lost murmured doctor mixinger and just when you ought to be in your prime
any appetite not a particle returned uncle wes his fascinated eyes on the automatic which the doctor continued to hold in her hand
all i can eat for breakfast is about six slices o bacon a couple o slabs of bread three or four eggs and two cups o coffee every last thing my stomachll take in the morning eat enough t keep life in a chipmunk
how about dinner and supper the doctor went on do better at dinner quite a little better only jest a snack mebby a hunk o cold roast and a pot o tea and two or three pieces o pie
last night i had cakes and sirup and i never slept a wink turrible bad off today and now youre makin me a lot worse has sent you up to kill me he added accusingly
how much exercise do you take mr donot dast exert myself too much doc flickinger says
if i was to try to walk around the block drop in my tracks before i got halfway
bout all i navigate is to the dinin room for breakfast out here till dinner then to the dinin room agin then back here till supper then the dinin room then along about nine i totter off to bed
all i can do to make it sometimes
plumb shot to pieces thats the trouble with me
i reckon you can see it canot you get up mr ordered doctor mixinger
you and i are going to take a walk around the block
never mind your shoes those slippers will do
you donot need a hat either
come on
no shouted uncle wes horrified aimin to lay me out cold pint that gun at me
go way or call the police
i canot come on doctor eyes flashed and she leveled the automatic
uncle wes staggered to his feet
with the doctor right behind him he reeled across the veranda and through the doorway into the hall
brace up ordered the doctor
throw your shoulders back breathe deep hang on to the banister as you go downstairs
there thats right
now then keep step with me
down on the sidewalk the neighbors had a glimpse of uncle wes hatless and in his old slippers moving along at the side of doctor mixinger
josh hopper stared after the two from his front steps
he wagged his head forebodingly killin him he said to himself reckon i might as well call the undertaker
this is awful as doctor mixinger and uncle wes rounded the block the doctor steadily increased the pace
when they got back to front door uncle wes had to gallop to keep up but he noticed as he climbed the stairs and returned to the secondstory veranda that he was not breathing much faster than usual
he was astounded
well remarked the doctor with a laugh you didnot drop did you
mr either flickinger has scared you or you have scared yourself
you havenot any more heart trouble than i have
what you need and all you need is exercise physical and mental
that is your proper tonic
forget your health take on a hobby or find some compelling purpose and follow it with all the enthusiasm you can muster
you must have an object in life that will make you think and stir around
then then i ainot goin to die in three months asked uncle wes faint with wonder
you are going to die in about thirty years providing you smoke less and stop dosing yourself with those patent nostrums
you are perfectly sound and that is quite remarkable considering the way you have coddled yourself for ten years
i never saw a man of your age who was potentially more capable of getting the utmost out of life
but cut loose and be active
this is a bright and happy world and you are perfectly competent to get your full share of the brightness and happiness
while talking the doctor had been closing the little square case
straightening she turned and held out her hand in a friendly way was paid five hundred dollars to come here and tell you this she continued and you ought to be grateful to your nephew for it is the best advice you have ever had
i beg your pardon for displaying the pistol but i think youll admit that you were a difficult case and hard to handle
i trust there are no hard feelings
uncle wes took the offered hand then startled by the great truth that had suddenly dawned upon him he watched wideeyed while doctor mixinger vanished through the doorway
ten o my best years plumb wasted he muttered kicking over the canvas chair
run around that block without so much as ketchin my breath nothin the matter not a thing except the want of exercise
i he broke off abruptly as his eyes happening to cross the veranda railing encountered doc flickinger moving on the boarding house from up the street
flickinger was coming to make his customary morning call on uncle wes
the eyes of the old prospector narrowed and his face grew hard the cimiroon that done more to make me waste them ten years than any one else on earth he growled reckon due for a little more exercise he finished and crouched beside the door leading to the secondstory veranda
a a of shocks that jarred the boarding house from underpinning to roof lifted josh hopper out of his chair and carried him at a double quick to the second floor of his establishment
mrs hopper and pedro the man of all work joined him as he raced
when the three of them arrived on the upper veranda what they saw made them almost doubt the evidence of their senses
uncle wes the confirmed invalid had doc flickinger flat on the porch floor and was pinning him there with two knees on his chest
in a fury uncle wes was bumping head on the hard boards while flickinger begged for mercy
yes roared uncle wes feelin quite well this morning doc
no this exercise ainot hurtin my heart a particle but seems to be right soothin
i reckon you neednot call any more
you see made up my mind to live thirty years instead of jest three months convalescin fast you glad to see how recuperatin under your treatment you mr and mrs hopper and pedro flung at him and with their united efforts managed to heave him clear of the prostrate flickinger
the latter bounding to his feet fled for the stairs the street and safety
he left his hat spectacles and his medicine case behind
uncle wes flung them after him over the railing and the medicine case jingled merrily as it struck the ground
what on earth is the matter wailed mrs hopper hysterically
uncle wes leaped into the air and let off a whoop a well man thats whats the matter he declared come to and got wise to how flickinger was stringin me along
that lady doc doctor sort of opened my eyes
she made me do things that flickinger said i couldnot do without passin out
oh my gorry what a fool been
you can have your secondstory porch hopper done with it
he ran to his room kicked off his slippers and began putting on a pair of shoes
then he got into clothes which he had made it a practice to wear only on sundays
he had a compelling object in mind
now that he was a healthy man with thirty good years ahead of him he realized his mistake in giving the hundred thousand dollars to his nephew
his business was to overhaul and recover as much of the money as possible
dinner was ready by the time uncle wes was ready for the street but delaying to eat while was spending with an open hand was out of the question
uncle wes reasoned that the faster he hurried the more of his good money he would recover
the sight of wesley plunkett traveling at speed along the streets of phoenix caused the oldtimers to rub their eyes and wonder if they were seeing things
it was ten years since anything like that had happened before
it was an incredible performance for one whose days were said to be numbered
must be flighty was the general comment he ought to be captured and taken back to but no one tried to capture him
there was a look in the old prospectors face that warned against interference
he came to the hotel fordham dashed through the street entrance and ran to the counter behind which felix vannell stood and blinked my nephew demanded uncle wes
tell him here and want him pronto
get a move on young feller because this is mighty important left here bright and early this morning mr replied the clerk
uncle wes dropped his elbows on the desk and bowed his tall form across it he go he barked
him and charley vandeever started for los angeles where the chances for spending money in a big way are a lot better than they are here
this was a terrible wrench for uncle wes
he stifled a groan
physically there had been a change in him a complete transformation but mentally he was the same old tightwad
the thought that had already escaped and was on his way to a big and extravagant city where the rest of the hundred thousand would melt away like dew in the morning sun was a blow between the eyes
uncle wes came out of his daze to inquire wh what train did he take
i can overhaul him with a telegram
hurry what train did he leave on
and whats he doing with charley vandeever think he called in vandeever to help him get rid of his money and they didnot leave by train
they bought one of these aeroplanes for sixteen thousand dollars and hired the chap that owned it to take them to los angeles paying that pilot a hundred dollars a day you see the papers this morning full of it
uncle wes groaned again
he staggered
then he thought of the bank in which had deposited the money
on a forlorn chance he went there and instituted inquiries
he was informed by the cashier that whipple had drawn out all the money in his account taking it in thousanddollar bills
when he left the bank uncle wes felt like a beaten man
he had his health and he had a lot of money left but it hurt him to the soul to see the remains of that hundred thousand dollars getting away from him
back at he made his plans to go to los angeles by train and be there to meet and vandeever when they arrived
hopper however explained to him that the aeroplane traveled so fast that it would probably be in los angeles before uncle wes could get a train out of phoenix
uncle wes suddenly had an idea
til send a telegram to the chief of police in los angeles he said and have and vandeever arrested the minute they come down stop em
they wonot be able to spend any money if theyre in jail
jest as soon as i learn theyve been arrested go to los angeles myself get back whats left of my money and tell the police to turn em loose
he went to the courthouse and talked with the sheriff then the sheriff got busy and wired the los angeles police department
following this there was a period of waiting
feeling that he had made an excellent move uncle wes grew calm
he read the papers and learned how accompanied by the irrepressible charley vandeever had bought the aeroplane hired the pilot and taken flight from the city park
this sensation divided honors in the daily press with a big bank robbery at eudora arizona in which three bandits had made a daylight raid and escaped with sixty thousand dollars in cash and liberty bonds
the bank was offering five thousand dollars for the capture of the robbers and ten per cent of all cash and bonds recovered
this affair interested uncle wes only because it claimed the attention of the local sheriff and gave him less time to devote to and vandeever
uncle wes haunted the sheriffs office waiting for news of the arrest of his nephew and vandeever and made himself a nuisance
one day two days passed and still the aeroplane had not reached los angeles nor had it reached any other known port of call east or west north or south
a deep dark mystery had suddenly fallen over that aeroplane
after leaving phoenix it had neither been sighted nor heard of
probably the opinion ran it had been wrecked somewhere on the deserts or in the mountains and would never be heard of again
then on the third day after the flying machine had left phoenix among the suspicious characters brought in by the sheriff and his posse to be questioned regarding the eudora robbery was a weazelfaced known to be a side partner of the gambler threecard monte
he told a story after a session of the third degree that let in a flood of light on the spenders bound for los angeles
monte it seemed had subsidized the pilot of the aeroplane and won his consent to land his passengers on saddleback flats at the edge of the estrella mountains
this was a lonely hole in the hills inhabited solely by scorpions tarantulas and sidewinders
but the gambler and some of his friends would be at saddleback flats if not when the aeroplane arrived at least shortly thereafter and their plans were to annex every dollar carried by and vandeever by fair means or foul
the discovery that monte and his confederates had left by fast automobile in the general direction of saddleback flats the very morning the aeroplane had hopped off corroborated the story told by the informer
deputy sheriffs started at once for saddleback flats
they refused to let uncle wes ride in their car but his enthusiasm for an active role in recovering his money spurred him to hire a flivver and follow on to the flats
galusha mingo went with him and although it was manifestly no work for a woman katie mingo insisted on going with her father
katie was wild with apprehension over and uncle wes had not the heart to insist that she stay at home especially since mingo was bearing rather more than his share of the flivvers hire
this second party got away three hours after the deputy sheriffs had started all be too late hazarded galusha mingo gloomily
more than likely monte and his gang have got the money and are in parts unknown by this time had a lesson mourned uncle wes hang on to my money after this and not fool it away on a spendthrift nephew
but oh what do you suppose has happened to wailed katie fret about him katie said uncle wes with whom girl was a prime favorite be back in gold mill before many days working for thirty a week as usual a after alls said and done and nobody ever yet made him hard to find aeroplane had been named by percival simmons the ace high and since a hand in a poker game with nothing but ace high seldom wins simmons name for his flyer was not much of a recommendation
neither whipple nor vandeever however drew their speculations out so fine
the former paid ten thousand and the latter six thousand and when the ace high hopped off at phoenix that bright friday morning it was their property and the former owner was on their pay roll at one hundred dollars a day
whipple had turned the balance of his bank account into cash and he had with him on taking the air in his flying start for los angeles seventyfive bills and a hundred plus in small change
it was enough certainly to finance a tolerable round of pleasure for two wandering spendthrifts
the three passengers were distributed in separate cockpits along the backbone of the ace high simmons in front just back of the propeller then whipple and then vandeever
just before the takeoff whipple had overheard simmons making inquiries about the estrella mountains and saddleback flats
this struck him as queer and he had asked the pilot why he was so interested in that particular part of the country
simmons answered that he merely wanted to use the mountains and the flats as a landmark while conning his course
whipple was surprised to discover as soon as they were in the air that he was not in the least dizzy
there was a deafening clamor in his ears
this was continuous and made conversation impossible
and when he got out from behind his wind shield to look overside a frightful rush of wind tore the breath out of his lungs
but there were no unpleasant sensations and all his doubts about the aeroplane being a good buy were dissipated
thirty minutes after the start a sunbaked wilderness destitute of human life was unrolling beneath the ace high at the rate of a hundred miles an hour
whipple knew that a mountainous country lay below but viewed from overhead it seemed flat and every highflung butte and peak had no more visible elevation than a cactus clump
simmons kept constant watch presumably looking for landmarks
why this was necessary at that stage of the journey was incomprehensible to whipple
a compass course due west was all that was needed
the pilot theless seemed anxious and worried and at last confused
he dipped lower in order to get a clearer view of the country and then he lifted higher circled and cut figure eights miles long twisting and turning and falling and rising until whipple lost all sense of direction and could only judge the way they were traveling by taking a slant at the sun
charley van was likewise puzzled by these maneuvers
he leaned over to yell something in ear
after several attempts he made it manifest to whipple that he did not like the proceedings and that they were losing time with all those curlicues when they ought to be whooping it up on a straightaway course and wouldnot just yell that into simmons ear order him to point for los angeles keep going and oblige
whipple leaned over his wind shield and shouted at the aviators helmeted head the joint objections of the two owners of the machine to the man they had hired to run it
simmons answered something but whipple could not understand what it was
with one hand on simmons leatherclad shoulder with the other whipple indicated a westerly direction
the pilot nodded nosed the machine skyward and started again on the proper course
for ten minutes everything went beautifully and then all at once the terrific din of the propeller failed in a swift diminuendo
presently only the screech of the wind could be heard among the taut wires and stays
there could be talk now that was clearly heard the idee simmons demanded charley van
engine trouble of some kind answered the pilot his hands passing swiftly over the controls dead and i canot get a kick out of it
then what inquired whipple with a sinking sensation got to volplane down
look for a place to land both of you
if we canot find the right kind of a place were all done for
this was pleasant news
the ace high was corkscrewing downward in wide circles and the ground below seemed to be jumping up at it greedy for a collision
with wide fearful eyes whipple and vandeever were trying to discover a level stretch of ground among the tumbled mountain peaks
can you see anything of saddleback flats yelled simmons wildly miles to the west of them flats charley van roared at him
the country down there looks to me a heap more like the gila bend divide than the estrellas
oh by glory sim youve sure got me all mixed up
hit the flat desert canot you we canot hit anything but those peaks was the pilots answer you see anything that looks level and smooth down there
use your eyes
with sickening rapidity the sawtooth crests of the hills leaped at the ace high a canon cried whipple as the flying machine cut across the yawning mountain chasm at perhaps five hundred feet
and a flat at the bottom of it added vandeever
can you drop into that gash and light on the flat got to answered simmons between his set teeth if i donot its all over but payin the bets
he manipulated the falling machine in such fashion that the nose of it was brought in line with the north and south trend of the canon then straightening out the plane rushed downward
they cleared the two steep walls of the gash and by a turn to the left hit the flat with a shock that almost threw whipple and vandeever out of their cockpits
the flyer lurched and wabbled over the rough ground finally halting with a crash
whipple took a header into the air landed on one of the wings rolled down the steep slope of it and off the end in a sixfoot fall on a nest of bowlders
there he curled up quietly and went to sleep
he awoke to find charley van throwing water in his face
how you feelin inquired the cowboy anxiously good deal like i did when the street car hit me answered whipple in a faint voice waste all that good water charley give me a drink
vandeever limped away bent down over a small stream refilled his stetson and came back this fierce he commented gloomily as whipple gulped the water over the hats brim reckon this deal was a mistake simmons asked whipple
who cares a hoot about sim snapped vandeever
he sold us a sky boat with a bum engine and now see whats happened
i allow if he broke his neck we wouldnot be much moren even
no such luck came the melancholy voice of the pilot
he was sitting on a bowlder minus his helmet and leather jacket and was knotting a handkerchief around his left forearm using his right hand and his teeth
whipple had been dragged clear of the rock pile and he now sat up and took a look around
he was at the edge of a flat and the flat was at the bend of the canon
the walls of the defile were high and straight up and dow merely smooth precipices
a small stream babbled over the rocks of its narrow course and in the sandy stretches were rank growths of mesquite
the ace high had run head on into the canons east wall
the lefthand planes had been crumpled up by a big cottonwood tree and the front end of the machine had been crushed as far back as the pilots cockpit
simmons surely had been lucky to escape alive
think you can fix up the old catamaran sim inquired vandeever
not hardly was the sarcastic response a total wreck
landing gear all smashed propeller all in pieces port planes in smithereens and engine knocked into a cocked hat
when we get away from here well have to walk
walk yelled the exasperated vandeever
do you know what sort of country lies between us and civilization bout steen hundred miles of desolation with nothin to feed on but chuckwallas and nothin to drink but the juice of niggerhead cactus
walk
man we never could make it
if your old pop bottle had to give out why didnot it pull the play within hailin distance of phoenix an elegant mess o fish
whipple got up and balanced himself dizzily on his legs look around and get our bearings he suggested somethin to do anyways vandeever assented
they moved northward toward the upper end of the canon
simmons did not go with them but sat disconsolately on his bowlder and began spiritlessly to manufacture a cigarette
he donot need to worry a hull lot remarked vandeever got his sixteen thousand so bustin up the ace high donot mean a thing in his young life
it didnot take us long to get rid o that bunch o money anyways
plumb wasted and nothin to show for it this is a right discouragin canon if anybody asks you
look at them walls a hundred feet straight up and even a squirrel couldnot get from here to the rim rock
and theres the north end it is just like the side walls
i move we take a look over south
the north end of the canon was closed by a sheer precipice
the little stream hitting the wall sank out of sight under it flowing through a subterranean channel
wait a minute called whipple halting his companion who was about to turn back this
on the smooth surface of the end wall some hand had rudely inscribed with red pigment lost creek canon
no chance to get out
bottled up
johnson blue
vandeever read the inscription gave a howl of despair and threw up his hands
lost creek canon by glory that does settle it were planted for keeps
what do you mean charley
whipple asked you never heard tell of johnson blue over to the no one ever mentioned lost creek canon around mine not that i remember
say listen
this here is a pocket there ainot no gettin out of
once here youre here to stay
only its as hard to get into as it is to get out of mostly
johnson blue got into it with ropes explorin like and the ropes got loose and come down on him
a carrier pigeon he had with him got back to prescott with the news but the message was weatherbeaten and dim in spots
the location of lost creek canon wasnot readable and people hunted for it for months hopin to save blue
but he wasnot never saved
i reckon if we look well find whats left o him around here somers
vandeever took off his hat and slammed it down on the rocks then he leaned against the sheer wall and laughed huskily and mirthlessly
and heres you and me he went on loaded to the brim with dinero and aimin to cut loose with it in los angeles bottled up in lost creek canon without no carrier pigeon or ropes or nothin jest plumb cast away thats all and when were laid out cold the birdsll get them thousanddollar bills and line their nests with em
he laughed again and the walls of the canon gave back the nervewracking echoes
a north end of lost creek canon was cheerless forlorn and offered a despairing prospect but a find was made around the bend in the south end that put heart in the three castaways
the walls here were steep and unscalable and a lofty barrier thrown across the defile made of it a complete culdesac
here lost creek found itself bubbling up from beneath the foot of the barrier flowing the length of the canon and losing itself again at the other end of that tremendous blind alley
the surroundings south of the bend were not so depressing
the walls were hung with trailing vines which gave a bowerlike aspect to that part of the mountain prison and there was a flat covered with a thick growth of oaks and pinons and in the heart of this grove whipple and vandeever stumbled upon their big surprise a small but comfortable log cabin
that cabin could not have been built by johnson blue discoverer and original castaway of lost creek canon
it was seven years according to vandeever since homing pigeon had fluttered into prescott and the cabin was plainly of very recent construction
it stood empty and deserted and there was no path leading to its door
the door was not secured in any way but opened readily to hand
the single room within was marvelously equipped for comfort
three bunks furnished with blankets and pillows were built against the walls
three chairs stood around a small table and in a cupboard plates cups and saucers knives forks and spoons continued to carry out this remarkable grouping of threes
charley van pulled off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair
looks like somebody had been gettin ready for our party was his comment this jest nacherly rattle your spurs in a second cupboard was found a bag of flour strips of hacon a box of potatoes and a generous supply of canned goods
there was a stove too in one corner of the room with pots and pans hanging all around it and even a supply of firewood piled beside it
charley van collapsed into one of the chairs once say that our cup was and caught a little good luck when it rained trouble we didnot outfit ourselves with so much as a ham sandwich when makin that start for los angeles in the skyhooter so if mrs class luck hadnot dropped this cabin and contents down in the canon for us wed sure have starved plumb to death so new the worms havenot even got in the prunes
we can draw out the agony for quite a spell figgerin
charley returned whipple this pocket in the hills isnot so blamed inaccessible as you have been trying to make me believe
somebody came here and fixed up this place calculating to make a home out of it seen for yourself vandeever returned that there ainot no gettin out of here unless we sprout wings admit that hombres could come down on a rope same as johnson blue done but without that same rope gettin out is goin to bother a heap
three men built this cabin and got it ready to live in whipple went on and that wasnot so long ago because everything is fresh and new
they must be planning to come back here very soon
well charley when they come well use their means for getting into the canon to get out of it
all we have to do is to wait exclaimed vandeever hoping toe get our chance to pull out before your thirty days are up and you are left stranded with that bundle of kale have to spend faster than i reckoned on when we do hit los angeles
now bein hungry and the like o that how about gettin simmons over here
he was braggin about how he can cook
suppose we start him in
all right go get him
vandeever found simmons still sitting on his bowlder very much cast down you forget were his first words to vandeever that still drawing my hundred a day a mere baggytelle perce returned the cowboy was you stringin us when you said you could cook a regular chef boasted simmons and i was sitting here thinking how i could eat if there was only anything eatable in sight
well chirk up were goin to feed
come on and show you
when the cabin and its supplies burst on his vision the aviator was astounded
whipple was building a fire in the stove but vandeever pulled him away from the work
sim tells me that he expects us to pay him the hundred a day whether were flyin or laid up in this canon said vandeever
by doin the cookin and taking care of the ranch i calculate that hell make all of five dollars a day anyways so i move we let him do it you and me will jest sit around and fret because the spendin is so poor
get busy sim among the supplies were two or three dozen packages of cigarettes several pounds of smoking tobacco and half a dozen decks of cards
vandeever made these discoveries and announced them joyfully he whispered to his friend with my luck at the pasteboards itll be blamed little of that hundred a day ever see
simmons proved that he was really a capable cook by preparing an excellent meal
all were in better spirits after they had eaten their dinner
while simmons was clearing away the empty dishes vandeever tumbled into one of the bunks for a nap and whipple roamed around the flat
it seemed to whipple as though there must be some way into that canon and out of it
the stories about johnson imprisonment in that mountain pocket might be farfetched
whipple was not so credulous as vandeever seemed to be so he went hunting for a possible avenue of escape
he failed to find it
the walls masked with trailing vines were as precipitous as the bare rock faces in other parts of the canon
whipple wondered if the vines were strong enough to bear his weight
he learned that they were not for essaying a climb by means of the festooned creepers he sustained a fall of a dozen feet and gave up his attempts
as he moved around the edge of the flat his foot kicked against something and he stooped and picked up a small tin box
the box was scarred and worn and locked
he broke it open
inside of it was an openface silver watch with a leather fob and an elks tooth charm attached to it eighteen cents in change a comb and brush a pocket knife and a memorandum book
sitting down at the foot of an oak he fell to examining the various objects
on the back of the watch was the monogram the same initials were engraved on the handle of the knife
relics of johnson blue thought whipple and picked up the little book
on the flyleaf he read this written in a firm businesslike hand johnson blue late of new york city now of nowhere in particular his impressions of life based on the way in which he lived it and written for his own amusement while he slowly starved to death
this was gruesome but it held a fascination for whipple
blue really had been bottled up in that canon
he had sent out his carrier pigeon hoping for rescue
rescue had not come and famine had claimed him for a victim
what you got this was vandeever
having finished his nap he had gone searching for whipple
the latter told him what he had found and how he had chanced upon it
by glory the cowboy exclaimed sitting down at his friends side and looking with deep interest at the watch the knife the military hair brush and the comb
eighteen cents
he was mighty nigh busted flat wasnot he
whipple read from the flyleaf of the book
purty tough commented vandeever with feeling
and we might have starved allee same as blue if somebody hadnot built that cabin for us and filled it with supplies
poor old blue
he must a been blue them last days
i canot imagine nothin worse than havin hunger get you
read about them impressions of his whipple began to read no help has arrived and i have come to the conviction that the carrier pigeon failed to reach prescott
that means that my days are numbered
the chuckwallas are not very plenty and not very appetizing
in the heyday of my wastrel year i remember how squab on toast chicken a la maryland and roast canvasback duck palled on my jaded appetite
if i had my million back i would give all of it for one dinner at i have kept pulling up my belt a notch until it makes a circle no bigger than a dogs collar and not a very large dogs collar at that
but why repine
i have had my fling and here i am holed away among the bleak mountains with my large fortune dwindled to a pitiful eighteen cents a good exhibit in the case of gal life versus a sensible existence i am a horrible example in the matter of what not to do with a million dollars and i feel the urge to put some of my philosophy down with pen and ink
no one will ever see it but the mere writing will be a relief to my mind and will serve to beguile this period of waiting for the end
and i have an idea that i can make my finish the finest things i have done in all my riotous year
gosh exclaimed vandeever as whipple paused reflectively
now whyever do you suppose he was writin like that read on answered whipple and see if we can find out was a happy man before my uncle ezra died and left me that million dollars in hard cash
kept books for halloran beezley and received a hundred dollars a month for it
got along beautifully put aside a little every week for a rainy day and had enough left to ride over to coney of a saturday afternoon and take some real enjoyment
and get away to the polo grounds occasionally and yell myself hoarse over a good ball game
and there was ethel
there are fine rls in this land but none finer than ethel wish she might know what has finally happened to me but that is hardly possible
if i had taken her advice but not sobbing about that or anything else
i mixed this dose of medicine for myself and going to swallow it with a smile
back in the old days though i was happy
and i didnot know it
i lived in a little paradise all my own and i was getting ahead at the rate of about three hundred a year
then a snake crawled into my paradise a snake with glittering golden scales and diamond eyes uncle million dollars didnot have to work any more what i told halloran beezley
work was for those poor fish who had no uncle to die and leave them a million
i started out to put some new brightness in the gay white way
they said i made good
i had friends everywhere and they did their best to make me forget i had ever been a bookkeeper
is it much of a trick to run through a million in a year
not in a town like new york wet or dry
when a man who now and then has to walk to save car fare wakes up with a million in his mitt maybe hell still walk to save car fare but i doubt it
if he is young as i was and if he has abilities as a spender as i had hell probably buy himself a flock of automobiles and never walk any more than he just has to
i scattered the million in twelve months and now here am far from the bright lights a prisoner in these hills and with only eighteen cents in my pocket a fine case of dyspepsia and roasted chuckwallah doesnt agree with a finicky stomach all rusty from lack of exercise and i came to arizona for the mountain cure everlastingly too late time i died and r vandeever reached over jerked the book from hands and threw it angrily out across the flat reckon thatll be all of that he growled
now that we got our pockets full o money i ainot in any mood to listen to such stuff
i hadnot a notion blue was that kind of a ciiniroon
looks like he was hitting at us eh charley queried whipple tell a man and it ainot a fair go either
why inmlazes did you have to kick that tin box out o the brush but blue wasnot the same as you in your uncles contract that you got to spend
blue wasnot obliged to do what he done
he was goin on his own when he got down to them eighteen cents some people plumb foolish
whipple and vandeever at the foot of the oak in lost creek canon sat brooding in deep thought over the foolishness of johnson blue
what angle was taken by their vagrant thoughts is no matter but presently the cowboy got up walked sheepishly over to the little book and picked it up and dusted it off
take care of it he said handing the melancholy record to his friend
like enough after all you and me will get eighteen cents worth o fun out o readin it
if he goes into his spendin habits maybe therell be a tip for us when we get to los have to work fast if were held up here for much of a spell
a little book of johnson wielded an uncanny influence
two days after it had been found all three young men in the canon had come under its mystic spell
when whipple was not reading it aloud to his companions either vandeever or simmons was sure to have it and to be deeply immersed in its contents
the sorry chronicle was less than five thousand words in length
in giving so much time to it therefore the castaways were continually rereading parts of the manuscript
each had his favorite passages and whipple curious to know just what appealed most to vandeever and simmons took up the little book as each laid it down
in case his clews were various leaves bent at the corners and in simmons a pencil checking of sundry paragraphs
it developed that the cowboys interest was held by ingenious methods of extravagance
he would charter a sumptuous private train for instance and take a large party of friends to some prize fight in the middle west or he would buy a private yacht spend a riotous month in the west indies and then sell the yacht for less than half what he had paid for it
he would give dinners to boon companions at which diamond and platinum stick pins were passed around as favors
once in florida he had rented an entire hotel for a week living in it in lonely grandeur with every employee at his beck and nod
an extravagant eccentricity was never to wear the same suit of clothes twice but give away each suit when it was taken off
simmons marked passages consisted largely of philosophical deductions false friend is one who shares your bounty battens on your favors and then fails to recognize you when your money is gone
he is a deceiver and a thief
and this crook is the physical manifestation of a crooked soul warped by greed and a hunger for easy money
better that a man should have a millstone hung about his neck and be flung into the sea than to profit in such a way
and again not money but the love of money is the root of all evil
because of this we betray a trust and land in jail or we commit murder and hang
one who loves money for itself is capable of any atrocity
whipple on his own part was entranced with the whole tragic story but his pet paragraphs were some of platitudes such as waste not want not and be careful with what you earn and doubly careful with what is given you and stand on your own feet he beholden to no man for so much as a nickel and spend wisely but save with even more wisdom for a tightwad is anathema and a wastrel is a lost soul and lastly this priceless ruby in the casket of diamonds be not lured by relatives or friends or strangers into ways of wasteful extravagance for an act repeated becomes habit and habit becomes second nature and second nature becomes character and character makes us what we are for better or for worse
all this to some minds would have been a mere collection of rubbish
it is quite possible to understand why the last writings of johnson blue might appeal to whipple and why a cowboy eager to master all the fine arts of getting rid of money might be interested in them but that percival simmons should ponder such passages as he had marked was an incomprehensible mystery
johnson blue with just money enough left to get him to some corner of the country had come to prescott
like timon of athens he yearned for some desert place where he could forget the ingratitude of those whom he had believed to be friends and kill all thoughts of the girl ethel who had married a better man
so he bought a burro a grub stake several hundred feet of rope a homing pigeon in a wicker cage and set out for the heart of the hills
his idea was to immure himself on an island in the air a supposedly unscalable mesa called encan tada that had come to be a legend in the southwest
his purpose was to get away by himself burn all his bridges and even cast off the ropes by which he had hoped to gain the mesas top
then if he tired of his hermitlike existence he would send word back to prescott by means of the carrier pigeon and some one would come and effect his rescue
it was a wild fancy
he failed to find mesa encantada but he did happen upon a pocket in the ground as difficult of access as any island in the air
with his ropes he managed to get into it but the ropes loosened and came down on him before he had lowered the remainder of his supplies into the canon
weeks later his half starved burro wandered into wickenburg this however was long after the carrier pigeon had made its home port with a damaged message that told of plight but failed to define his exact whereabouts
so from last writings and information given by vandeever whipple pieced the story together
somehow the thrill of it grew on him as the days passed
it seemed to grow on the cowboy and the aviator as well
knotty problems offered themselves to the castaways
were they destined to reach the end of their provisions and come to a wretched end there in lost creek canon as blue had done
who had built and furnished that cabin on the flat with supplies for three
on the answer to this second question hung their hopes of deliverance
a week passed however without bringing the owners of the cabin
vandeever for once in his life at least had something more than his stetson on his mind
by glory he complained lost a hull week here in this hole in the hills waitin for some one to come got to stop coolin our heels and try to find a way out
grub is goin fast and i move we meander around and try to find them ropes of maybe they havenot rotted clean to pieces and we can use em in gettin clear o this blamed pocket
so they went hunting for the ropes
but they had vanished completely
when absolutely certain that they were not to be found further attempts were made to climb the wall by means of the hanging vines
the vines were fragile and after vandeever had taken a bad tumble the maneuver was given up as hopeless
simmons raided the wreck of the ace high and removed and spliced to34 gether a number of guy wires
the resulting cable proved too stiff and unwieldy and nothing could be done with it
in desperation another forlorn search for the ropes was begun
it was while this was going on that simmons creeping along at the edge of the flat under a festoon of trailing vines found a small wicker cage with its door unlatched
this recalled blue to the minds of the castaways
here undoubtedly was the very cage in which he had kept his carrier pigeon
vandeever fired with a sudden thought dropped to his knees and continued investigations at that part of the foot of the cliff
he crept through the vines was lost to sight for five minutes and at last emerged into view with a white face and wild eyes touched em he gasped drawing his sleeve across his wet forehead and they they rattled
oh my glory
what rattled demanded whipple
bones in there blue whats left o him
never had such a start in my hull life layin under a bit of an overhang and he grinned up at me all white and and well he finished jest had to have air
blue is jest a pile o bones in a khaki suit
say muttered vandeever it give you a start sure answered whipple but weve got a duty to do charley a great little book he wrote and the least we can do is to bury these bones away in the pleasantest part of the flat
look his fountain pen
i want it for my own this and the eighteen cents
you can take the watch and knife and simmons can have the fob and the elktooth charm
who gets the book draw cuts for that
get simmons now got to do the best we can charley
the three men got to work and in a short time all that remained of johnson blue had been decently interred to the best of their ability
poor johnson blue
for one brief year everything he had wanted had been his
now there he lay and of what use to him were all the millions in the world whipple sat down
everything has been said that can be said i take it he remarked about a fool and his money
now and then at the bitter end a fool wakes up and says or writes a number of wise things
and we three would be fools if we did not profit by them
if we ever get out of this canon charley i make a solemn vow to give back to uncle wes the rest of his money going to tell him that not fitted for the job he set for me
then then you ainot goin to los angeles at all inquired vandeever plaintively going back to the mine to work in the gold mill
then me for the ranch if thats how you stack up said vandeever got mucho plenty of this canon and that book of his writings have plumb robbed me of all the pleasure i might have had helpin you spend your uncles money
i reckon the boys will gime the laugh but they canot sing that old chantey about the wad that wilted because it wonot stick
simmons was having a struggle with himself
at last he managed to get the better of his feelings and observed in a strained unnatural voice got something to say men
monte hired me to drop you on saddleback flats
he and two of his pals were to be waiting there and corral the kale you two had with you
i was to have a share in it
but i missed saddleback flats somehow in two jumps vandeever was in front of simmons had a notion moren once you was playin crooked he yelled
now then you twofaced sidewinder right heres where i beat you up whipple hastened to step between them
no he said sternly hands off of simmons charley
he didnot make anything by his treachery and here where weve put away johnson blue lets bury our animosity along with some of our fool ideas
vandeever was red and wrathful
not ordinarily could he have been halted in such a manner by the restraining hand of a friend but there was a spirit of peace abroad in the canon at that moment the spirit of johnson blue
all right simmons said vandeever to the aviator you ainot the only one in this bunch that made a stumble
you must not at that instant whipple leaped at vandeever and simmons and pulled them down
he was excited and a wild light gleamed jn his eyes
look he whispered pointing toward the vineclad wall coming
the men who built and stocked that cabin are here
watch descending sun slanting over the western rim of the canon brightened the eastern wall
the brightness was rising toward the top of the wall leaving the foot of the cliff in shadowy twilight
some thirty or forty feet up the face of the precipice full in the suns rays the mask of greenery had been opened and men could be seen working through the gap
evidently these men had found foothold on a shelf concealed by the hanging vines
at the distance from which they were viewed by whipple and his companions the forms were indistinct although it could clearly be seen that there were three of them
say this is bully exclaimed vandeever all the joy of a prospective deliverance rising in his soul
as they climb in well climb out
like enough horses brought them through the hills to the canon well well arrange to use them caballos for the trip back to phoenix luck he started across the flat in the direction of the cliff where the newcomers were at work but whipple caught his arm
not so fast charley wait here and watch for a while something about that cabin that never looked just right to me
it will be better i think to let those fellows get down into the canon before we show ourselves to them
they might decide not to come on if they found strangers here
vandeever looked thoughtful
strikes me youre too blame cautious he said but mebby its jest as well to play safe
he drew back into the tree shadows and continued to fix his gaze on the wall a path down that cliffside back o them vines right to the pint where them hombres are workin ran his comment and mebby thats the way johnson blue got in
but how do you reckon they found it
we never guessed there was a shelf part way up the wall did we
it wouldnot have done us any good if we had put in simmons
that shelf is all of thirtyfive feet straight up and we had no way of getting to it
by jupiter look at that
something was tossed out through the gap in the vines
it twisted writhed unfolded and dropped down ward resolving itself into a long rope ladder
as soon as it was in place the three men descended from the shelf one by one and landed on the flat
by that time the whole canon was plunged in gloom although the eastern rim rock still glimmered under the suns rays
wait till they get to the cabin whipple suggested and then well walk in on them light up and well be able to give each other a good siz ing give em a big surprise chuckled vandeever if i know anything about it
the newcomers trailed like shadows across the flat making straight for the cabin
whipple vandeever and simmons followed them at a distance bet a blue stack the cowboy hazarded that theyve got a mine down here placerings like as not no gold in lost creek canon averred whipple been keeping an eye out for that ever since we got here and the formations arenot right their idee in cornin here then what like to know
men arenot going to all this trouble in lost creek canon unless they have something up their sleeves
it doesnot look right charley
the newcomers had reached the cabin and lamplight suddenly glowed in the cabin windows
whipple and his two companions pushed on hurriedly and stepped in through the open door
they were greeted by a yell that indicated surprise and anything but friendliness a digger if it ainot concho charley the cattlepuncher gent as got to us for all that dough in the back room at whooped a voice
sure its him cried some one else
and hes bringin his pard monte cristo junior
surprisin luck if anybody asks you
simmons a third person demanded how did you happen to miss the flats the other morning
and how did you happen to know about this canon and get here and be waiting for us with these lambs of the golden fleece
you seem to have played your cards pretty well but be hanged if i can understand it
whipple was amazed
the last speaker was monte a trimlooking blackleg in fancy mountaineer clothes
the two with him were his roughneck pals pecos pete geohegan and silver sam hornaday
all in all they were about as hard an outfit as ever drifted through the arizona hills
each of the three was well armed and at the moment had a vicious sixgun on display
what weird turn of fate had brought these men into that lonely canon
whipple wished then that he had been even more cautious
bound for los angeles on a quest for spendthrift pleasures neither he nor his companions had carried anything in the way of firearms and his partners were holding all the trumps that hand
the surprises were mutual but every advantage lay with the newcomers a fine lot of coyotes ainot you now
vandeever remarked with fine sarcasm
you planned to trim me there in the back room at but i galloped off with every sou you three had in your clothes matchin my run o luck aginst every nickelplated holdout in your tinhorn crowd
then you schemed to get it all back by one way or another and missed the bet
oh youre a fine outfit of sobbers
monte smiled in the oily way characteristic of him not missing any bets here in lost creek canon concho he purred
why didnot you come down at saddleback flats according to agreement simmons he demanded whirling on the aviator
they got wise to me here simmons nodded toward whipple and vandeever and it wasnot safe
then the engine of the old boat went back on me and we just happened to land in this canon glad you got here threecard the best piece of luck that ever came my way
whipple and his pard would have killed me i guess if i hadnot had help
cold rage rose in heart you sorry now he asked that you didnot let me beat him up
sim has been playin off on us
whipple was nonplused
at the grave of johnson blue such a short time before he had felt that simmons confession and regrets were sincere but now he had executed a direct aboutface and was one of crowd
he made this certain by stepping to the other side of the cabin and joining the ranks of the gamblers
how much have they got with them simmons queried thousand in cash was the prompt reply
good i didnot know but they might have hidden it away somewhere
put it on the table whipple every last stiver of it you never roared vandeever show em our teeth
if they get that dinero make em fight for it
he picked up a chair and backed into a corner
concho remarked calmly when you and your outfit dropped into this canon you came within one of putting a crimp into the smoothest paign i ever planned
you found a neat little cabin here well stocked with supplies
you and your friends jumped right in and took possession of it not finding any fault with that but i want to assure you that while were here you and whipple are going to stay here
i expect to make this place my headquarters for the next six months
show fight concho and well drop you in your tracks
put down that chair be foolish charley said whipple all the odds are against us
this easy yielding wasnot at all like whipple as vandeever knew him so the latter reasoned that his friend had something at the back of his head in the way of a ruse
strategy that was what it must be
building his hopes on that vandeever lowered the chair sat clown in it gloomily and watched while whipple put all of uncle money on the table the part of wisdom whipple observed monte with unctuous approval
you might also sit down for the moment
pecos he went on you go back to the shelf and pull up the ladder have an uncomfortable night up there but weve got to make sure that whipple and concho donot clear out and tip off this new roost of ours to the sheriff
we canot let that happen you understand until were through with the canon
silver will relieve you in the morning and tomorrow night simmons or i will pull up the ladder and sleep on the shelf forget pecos finished that theres a bundle of money in this for all hands
the mention of money stifled the grumbling of pecos
he put away his gun pulled up his belt and left the cabin
monte approached the table and coolly appropriated the crisp bank notes that lay there
this should mean little to you whipple said he easily getting rid of it quickly and with a few thrills that ought to interest old plunks
sorry to dispossess you but weve got to have the cabin
you and concho can bunk down on the flat see that you donot starve at least while were here in the canon with you
when we leave for good well that will be another matter
got a mine here inquired vandeever
hornaday laughed hoarsely
well you might call it that returned with a twisted smile
pecos must be on the shelf by now he added so you two can clear out try any foolishness either of you
his voice sharpened as he launched the warning playing for a big stake and wonot stand for any nonsense on your part
good night send you something to eat in the morning
whipple and vandeever walked out of the cabin followed by the jeers of silver sam hornaday and percival simmons
as they moved away across the flat leaving behind them the cabin and its comforts the cowboy complained bitterly about the aviator
he ort to be killed have evened up our score jyith him if youd only have let me alone a while back
now see how he has turned on us
johnson book never got to him the same as it did to you and me
whipple drew closer to his irate friend
charley he whispered believe simmons is still on our side and that hes pretending to stand in with in order to be of help to us
never in this world declared vandeever emphatically
was that the reason you as so pesky meek in shellin out them thousanddollar bills
if a thought you was bankin on that
a fought till i dropped
simmons is a twofaced measly coyote all off with that noble idee o yours to give back the dinero to your uncle
but that ainot worryin me so much as gettin clear o this tough outfit and takin a slant for phoenix get back the money before we leave the canon asserted whipple
how
whipple did not know how but he believed there would be opportunities and they would be able to manage it
he led the way through the gloom to the overhang where johnson blue had pitched his dismal camp
aimin to sleep in there demanded vandeever
why not
it gets pretty cold at night and we must have some kind of shelter
what was good enough for blue ought to be good enough for us
whipple went down on all fours and crawled through the swinging vines
the cowboy followed him finally but not without many protests
pll bet the place is hanted he muttered
well it couldnot be haunted by a kindlier spirit than greatly obliged to johnson blue charley
he has shown me how to look wisely at some of the problems of life
huh grunted vandeever he was only a spender that got cold feet when his money was gone
mebby youll sleep but be hanged if i think goin to
night pard
a a rock was all that whipple and vandeever had to sleep on there under the overhang
but they were men of hard fiber and used to the hardships of the hills
the chastened spirit of johnson blue seemed to fill the place
to whipple this unseen presence was as a benediction nor was it as disturbing to vandeever as he had fancied it might be for when morning came he was sleeping so soundly that his friend had to shake him into wakefulness
see anything last night inquired the cowboy as he sat up and rubbed his eyes
not a thing
same here
glory
i never reckoned sleep like that crawl out o this hole in the wall and find the sun
a morning in southern arizona is one of the most cheering wonders of the country
the mounting sun has a glory all its own and the air has a tonic warranted to put to flight all the blue devils that lurk in a human heart
vandeever was in a more hopeful mood than on the preceding evening
if we could get hold of a couple o them sixguns he remarked while he and whipple were dipping their heads in the creek we neednot ask no odds of anybody whipple shook the water out of his hair and dried his face on his handkerchief play a waiting game charley he said and see what turns up busy getting breakfast over there at the cabin he added his speculative gaze on the smoke that was rising from the chimney could mow away a mans size share o grub if i had the chance
seems like might invite us in for the mornings snack
he wonot do that hes planning to keep us at a distance from the money and the guns and will send breakfast out to us
there comes sam hornaday now whipple added
and he ainot totin any chow grumbled vandeever disappointedly
hornaday however was not coming in the direction of the two at the foot of the vineclad cliff
he looked in their direction grinned unpleasantly and kept on toward the eastern wall
there he halted and yelled for pecos
the latter looked out from the opening among the vines answered the hail and then threw down the rope ladder
we could capture the ladder from them two if we had any kind o luck vandeever suggested
whipple shook his head
while pecos was descending the ladder hornaday stood at the foot of it on guard with a gun in each hand having a dream charley said whipple would be glad to have us try something like that
after the dust settled there would be one amalgamator and one cowpuncher to keep johnson blue company on this flat
and what good would the ladder be to us if we had to use it and leave the money behind got to have action vandeever fretted
walkin lame and jumpin through the hoop at orders is a heap more than i can stand
take it easy therell be plenty of action when the right time conies
pecos stepping from the rope ladder to the ground did a brief round of sentry go while hornaday climbed to the shelf and hoisted the trailing ropes then pecos made his way to the cabin
everything so far as cleverness could devise it had been made secure
presently simmons appeared at the cabin door carrying a basket
he struck out briskly across the flat moving in the direction of whipple and vandeever
the latter breathing hard jumped to his feet
whipple caught him and pulled him back
hang on to yourself charley he admonished
you donot want to spoil our breakfast do you canot begin to tell you how the sight o that traitor grinds me muttered vandeever see that he gets his if its the last thing i ever do
simmons halted a few feet away and set down the basket warily eying the cowboy as he did so
charley is getting me wrong he said pitching his voice low with you two but i can be of more help by pretending to stand in with straight
kick up some kind of a row so i can have an excuse to stand here and talk for a minute is watching from the cabin and hornaday from the shelf
at the first suspicion that not really throwing in with them be as helpless as you two are maybe worse off
whipple jumped to his feet and advanced a step worse than a sidewinder to turn us down like this he shouted apparently in great anger
all i want is a club roared vandeever
simmons jerked a revolver from his pocket seemingly he was holding the two wrathful men at bay
what he said still in an undertone was this hornaday and geohegan robbed the bank at eudora and they are hiding out here with sixty thousand dollars in cash and liberty bonds
they have fixed up this canon for a hangout and have some more robberies they are aiming to pull off
when they found us here it sort of spilled the beans
go easy you two
and be watchful
bullets are apt to come your way at any time not done yet
do something make it look as though there is bad blood between us and you are trying to get me
i was told to shoot at the first sign of trouble
vandeever started to make a rush
crack went simmons revolver
the bullet flew wide but vandeever clutched at his left arm and reeled back to be on the shelf tonight guarding the ladder simmons went on speaking hurriedly our chance to do something come down around midnight and well see what we can do at the cabin
it will be desperate though make up your minds to that
simmons whirled on his heel and started back across the flat turning again and again to flourish the revolver and shout wild threats reckon that play looked like the real thing said vandeever and sure surprised at that sim
at that mebby hes only stringin us along
give him the benefit of the doubt charley urged whipple prove to your satisfaction whether or not we can rely on him tonight
it donot seem right sensible that would send him here with that grub unless there was some kind of a hen on mused the cowboy darkly
he was rolling up his sleeve and binding a handkerchief about his arm a red silk handkerchief with which he had supplied himself in phoenix
having pretended to be wounded it was important to keep the deception alive
while eating breakfast he did not use his left hand but kept it tucked away between the buttons of his coat
the meal was a generous one consisting of coffee crackers bacon and fried potatoes
as the two friends ate they considered this new turn of events
monte widely known as a crooked gambler had blossomed into an robber and holdup man
a safe retreat from the law was that hidden and inaccessible canon
how had found it was a mystery but having found it he was not slow to recognize its value from a lawless viewpoint
if pressed by officers of the law he could come down his rope ladder and if the canon were found he could pull down the ladder as a last resort
from that spot he and his confederates could make their raids and then return to a rendezvous that was almost proof against discovery
naturally finding whipple and his companions in the canon was a disagreeable surprise to the unpleasantness however was tempered by the seventyfive thousand dollars which whipple had been forced to give up
for a little while and because of uncle money the gambler might bear with the castaways but in due course as whipple knew monte would tire of the trouble whipple and vandeever made him and would seek to eliminate them
before this tragic move was deliberately attempted the amalgamator and the cowboy would have to strike and strike hard with simmons help is the time averred whipple for we are taking grave chances if we wait longer than that
having finished his breakfast he lighted a pipe and arose to his feet go over to the bend and see if the wreck of the ace high has anything to offer us in the way of a makeshift weapon
if we come to close quarters with the gang tonight charley we ought to have something besides our fists to fight with
good idee assented vandeever
as they started north along the creek suddenly appeared from the cabin
he carried a rifle
where have you started for he shouted
jest takin a little amble to stretch our legs vandeever answered with a scowl
well amble around the flat but keep clear of the cabin
try to leave the flat concho and well open up on you
that goes as it lays
vandeever hesitated clenching his fist and grinding his teeth
fust time on record i ever took orders from a tinhorn he growled
but i reckon there ainot anything else to be done
he turned and began following whipple back toward the vineclad cliff
and heres something else yelled
you two have got to cut out the rough stuff when i send some one over with your meals
simmons ought to have laid you out concho
just for what you did this morning you men will get no dinner
if you prove to be peaceable and obey orders about staying on the flat take some supper over to you myself
vandeever was furious but he had sense enough to smother his feelings
most certainly he and whipple were under the thumb of this smooth tricky card sharp and hard though it was the situation would have to be borne for the present
the morning passed with another reading of johnson book and the discussions to which the various philosophical gems gave rise
in view of the melancholy circumstances that prevailed in the canon the last words of the wastrel castaway were more impressive than ever
noon passed and was as good as his word about withholding dinner
at one oclock pecos relieved silver as guardian of the ladder and both ruffians in going and coming jeered the two hungry men as they passed them
this is fierce tell a man grunted vandeever
hit me anywhere but where i live i can stand anything but that
we ought to be able to miss a meal with good grace charley said whipple
think what blue had to put up with
oh stand it returned the cowboy hastily but like to eat a hundred dollars wuth o ham and eggs in front of and him famishin and laced to a post with a reata
the afternoon dragged horribly and hornaday and simmons played cards in the shade of the cabin guns close at hand
they were careful to take up a position from which they could watch whipple and deever every minute
as the sun dropped low over the rim of the canon the card playing ceased and hornaday and simmons went into the house to get supper
when was called by hornaday to come in an eat he stood up and looked in the direction of the amalgamator and the cowboy changed my mind conho he called
you and your pard stood it so well without dinner that going to hold back ypur supper
vandeever gave an ugly laugh as vanished inside the cabin
even a smooth tinhorn like him can play the fool now and then he remarked to his friend
the worst fighter i ever seen was a guy just hungry enough to be mad and not starved sufficient to be any ways weak
because of losin them two meals walk in on the hull gang this minute alone and with my bare hands going to be some fight when we pull it off had played well a very difficult role
it was no easy maneuver to deceive monte and yet this is precisely what simmons had done
the gambler was convinced that the aviator was faithful to him and his lawless plottings and believed fully that no love was lost between the aviator and whipple and vandeever
so simmons was trusted with the work of guarding the rope ladder
he relieved pecos and went on duty while the sun was still flashing brightly on the vineclad wall but he had not been fifteen minutes on the shelf before and hornaday ran swiftly across the flat and took up their positions at the foot of the cliff
hey simmons shouted what are you doing with two extra sixguns got a brace of revolvers more than you need or are entitled to
drop them into the blanket
as he finished speaking he and hornaday stretched a blanket between them and waited for the weapons to be thrown into it
but they waited in vain
whipple and vandeever guessed what had happened
in his zeal to help them simmons had appropriated the extra revolvers and taken them with him when he climbed to the shelf
he was not minded to give them up and so yield an advantage gained by his cleverness
besides faith in him was shaken and temporizing with a man like this gambler when he was in such a state of mind would have been suicidal
simmons kept well back on the shelf and hung on to the guns
hornaday lost patience and swore heartily had better command of himself
put over the ladder percy and come down requested the gambler his tone and manner not at all suggestive of the emotions that filled him
simmons however was too knowing to let down the ladder and descend and place himself at the mercy of threecard monte
come down the gambler ordered at last dropping his mask of friendliness and proceeding to threats give you two minutes and if youre not down by that time silver and i will riddle the face of the cliff with bullets
no word or sign came from simmons then promptly when the two minutes were up a merry fusillade stirred wild echoes in the canon
pecos a cup of coffee in one hand and a sourdough biscuit in the other came to a corner of the cabin to watch the excitement
whipple was not slow to see that a situation had developed which if quickly and properly used would be highly advantageous to himself and vandeever
charley he whispered while and hornaday are busy with simmons and while geohegan is giving all his attention to that side of the canon no one seems to take any interest in you and me
come on detour to the west and reach the cabin door while geohegan is facing the other way
that scheme is a lulu muttered the cowboy with enthusiasm
a quick run to the left brought the two around the western side of the cabin
whipple was almost at the open door when pecos awoke to what was going on behind him
the coffee cup went one way and what was left of the biscuit went another
no yu donot he roared dashing for the open door and juggling with a revolver as he came on
back up or drop yu where yu stand whipple shifted his line of advance and instead of entering the cabin he plunged straight at pecos
the latter halted planted himself firmly and lifted the revolver
whipple was desperate and geohegan equally determined
a distant report shattered the still air breaking a lull in the target practice of and hornaday
geohegan gave vent to a hoarse yell of pain and the revolver fell from his fist
score one for sim shouted vandeever jubilantly
that was as neat a bit of drop firin as i ever seen
simmons had come into action and at the very instant his services could best serve his friends
whipple reached side at a jump and in a flash had gathered up the fallen weapon
into the cabin with you he ordered prodding pecos with the muzzle of the gun
monte yelled pecos as he gripped his injured right arm with his left hand sam trouble at the ca whipple gave pecos a push that sent him through the open door headlong got him cried vandeever from inside the cabin
get in here quick once the door is closed we can hold this shack aginst all comers
that move however effective though it might be was not for whipple and hornaday had lost all interest in simmons for the moment and were racing back toward the cabin
a revolver cracked and a bullet buzzed angrily past cheek
he found himself looking into the gamblers cool murderous eyes told you what to expect if you cut any capers snapped and now heres where you get yours
his first shot had missed because he was in too much of a hurry
now he was more deliberate and laughed jeeringly when whipple flexing his finger brought down the hammer of gun on an empty shell no doubt felt that he could afford to take his time and make sure
whipple was nearer the great divide at that moment than uncle wes had ever been in his life
but wasted three seconds and while his weapon hung fire a cabin window on his left crashed outward and in the midst of the flying glass came vandeever over the sill falling on the gambler and bearing him down the best ever charley exclaimed whipple and immediately gave his full attention to hornaday selected his lawless aids with care and discrimination and geohegan and hornaday were the pick of those men who regarded the law lightly and were of proved ability and courage
the tide was setting against but hornaday ran true to his traditions and while possibly dismayed he was ready for a lastditch fight
flinging himself down behind a small heap of firewood a few yards from the corner of the cabin he began taking pot shots at whipple from cover
indian fashion whipple took to a tree thus screened he broke the weapon that had failed him in the contest with and examined the shells in the cylinder
all were empty and useless a piece of carelessness on part which in other circumstances would have won a rebuke from vandeever had dragged into the cabin and there judging by the sounds that came through the open door he was fairly busy
with a useless gun and no cartridges at hand with which to replenish the cylinder whipple was at an impasse
hornaday watching weaseleyed was waiting for him to show enough of himself to make a target worth while
this blockade was lifted by simmons as unexpectedly as vandeever had crashed through the window and fered with watching from the shelf in the gathering half gloom the aviator had realized how badly he was needed by his friends so he had lowered the ladder crossed the flat and come up noiselessly on side of the woodpile
the first whipple knew of this was by a startled yell from hornaday
the yell was followed by sounds of a furious struggle and whipple left the oak tree and ran swiftly to give simmons a hand
from that point on the struggle was as brief as it was decisive
when hornaday at the revolvers point was marched into the cabin was discovered flat on his back on the floor two knees on his chest one hand compressing his throat and the other hand gripping revolver threatening and holding geohegan at bay
a little work on the part of whipple and simmons made the victory complete
ropes were found and the gambler and his confederates were firmly lashed and rendered helpless hands ere left free because of his wounded arm but his feet were bound and it was clear that he had lost all relish for further combat
that was short and snappy tell a man
vandeever exulted
about twice as short and snappy as if you had treated me and white and given us our grub
if you want to make a reglar panther out of a man jest give him a touch o famine that never occur to you
if you fellows want your seventyfive thousand dollars said take it and get out of here
we want more than that spoke up whipple the loot from the eudora bank
you donot think for a minute that well leave that behind the gambler scowled
simmons told you about that i reckon
and concho wasnot nicked at all this morning
vandeever laughed as he held up both hands
that was jest a possum play he answered
how does it feel havin the boot on tother leg
sim he added turning and giving his hand to the aviator you are the clear quill
thank johnson blue for that said simmons humbly as he shook the cowboys hand the writings in that little book have given me a brandnew outlook upon life glad we fell into this canon
same here supplemented vandeever
his glance roved reflectively over the supper table and the remains of the meal left by and his men
you strike a light he went on and stir up the fire and rustle some hot chow
honest i was never so hungry in all my born days
poor old blue
for half a day weve been under his pack o trouble here in starvation gulch
it brought us right close to him donot you think supplies in the cabin were raided for a bountiful meal and it was served piping hot
when vandeever at last pushed back from the table and lighted a cigarette he was in a genial and happy mood a satchel under that east bunk whipple remarked simmons and you will find your money and the bank loot inside was cashier and took charge of all the boodle
whipple found the small satchel cleared a space on the table and began checking over the contents of the satchel
all his thousanddollar bills were of course intact in addition to these he found twenty thousand dollars in bank notes of twenty fifty and onehundreddollar denominations all banded in packets
also there were liberty bonds to the amount of forty thousand dollars more
this is fine exclaimed whipple happily
now i can give my uncles money the most of it back to him and we can turn over the stolen loot to the bank a pinhead whipple if you do anything like that spoke up why donot you three men divide it up among you and take a trip abroad
whipple laughed vandeever glared and simmons looked uncomfortable
what you need you thievin tinhorn said vandeever is a course of study in johnson book
forty a month and found is all lookin forard to and tell a man that the prospect is more pleasin to me than ever it was in my old careless days
funny how a batch of writins like gets under a fellers hide ainot it
whipple vandeever and simmons passed their last night in the canon cabin
while two of them slept one was always on guard
the prisoners were resourceful and desperate men and no chances were to be taken with them
next morning there was an early breakfast and the three friends made their preparations for leaving the cabin and getting out of the hills
three canteens were filled with cool clear water from the creek and three packs of supplies were made ready
three revolvers belonging to and his partners were appropriated and their cylinders replenished with fresh ammunition
whipple had tried hard to learn something about the situation of the canon the route to be followed in getting back to phoenix and the method by which and those with him had reached that part of the rough country
the gambler had nothing to tell him and neither had hornaday nor geohegan never make it on foot had said your grub and water will be gone before you are halfway out
a stray prospector may find your bones some time in the future but even that is a bet
then returned whipple coolly it will be as hard on you as it is on us for when we leave here well haul up the rope ladder
if we get out well send a sheriff and posse back after you better isnot it than starving to death in this canon
a gloomy expression crossed the faces of hornaday and geohegan but the gambler seemed utterly unmoved
not according to my way of thinking said all the firearms in the cabin were carried away by whipple and his friends
geohegan was left with his hands free and it would be only a short time before he released and hornaday of their bonds
carrying off the guns was to prevent further trouble while the homewardbound party climbed to the rim rock and set out on the eastern trail
whipple who was the last man to reach the shelf found himself on a broad smooth ledge which had a downward pitch to the place where it joined the cliff
simmons explained how easy it had been to keep clear of bullets launched from the flat merely by hugging the rear wall
and theres the way up he finished indicating the lip of a fissure that angled steeply toward the top of the wall back of the swinging vines had a mind to explore that only didnot give me time
the rope ladder was drawn up and piled on the shelf and all the extra firearms were laid beside it then whipple leading the climb for the top was begun
steady nerves were demanded for this and the amalgamator was glad that the festooned vines hid from his eyes the dizzy depths of the canon
in due course he came out on the crest of the bank and paused to let his gaze rove over the flat
all the prisoners were free of their ropes and standing in a forlorn group by the cabin their faces no more than white patches against the greenery below
hornaday and geohegan shook their fists coolly lighted a cigarette gaze moved toward the left where a sandy mound lifted itself among the trees
all that was mortal of johnson blue was there a misguided man who found wisdom in the spot where death overtook him
kind o rough on blue remarked vandeever halting at side leavin him with that bunch of tough customers
you got his book and his eighteen cents have charley replied whipple and let us hope that the spirit of his last writings will be with us and nerve us for our fight in getting out of these hills
he turned to look eastward
it was a discouraging vista for all that could be seen in that direction was peak after peak
whipple descended an easy slope on his way to a seam that opened between two of the hills
he stopped suddenly his eyes on the sand in front of him
one secret is out anyway he exclaimed got here in an automobile where the machine stopped to let him and his two partners off and theres where it turned to take the back track
a note of cheer crept into his voice
if an automobile could get here he went on donot see how were going to run into any very hard traveling
all weve got to do is to follow the tracks
the tracks were easily traced and led into the seam wound tortuously about the bases of the hills and then climbed a ridge and descended into a wide shallow valley
the sun was mounting toward the zenith a brazen fiery shield whose rays grew hotter as the day wore on
heat waves rising from the baked earth quivered in the furnacelike air
clumps of cholla cactus and greasewood danced grotesquely when viewed through the wavering transparent veil
simmons was first to give out
he staggered to his knees with a groan no good at this kind of travel he complained
this pack on my shoulders weighs a ton
for the dozenth time he uncapped his canteen and put it to his lips
vandeever snatched it away from him waterlogged sim said the cowboy
we got to be careful o the stuff in the canteens
and anyways you could drink like a fish and it wouldnot help none
get up and try agin help you
with vandeever on one side and whipple on the other lending him their support the aviator reeled on
over his head the amalgamator and the cowboy exchanged significant glances
simmons was not toughened to the deserts as they were and they realized that he was going to be a tremendous handicap
but he had played a mans part in the canon face set hard and lips tightened
what one thought was at that moment in the mind of the other they would all win clear of those scorched waterless hills or they would all stay in them to the end of time
when simmons feet refused to move another step whipple found a great bare pinnacle of rock and in its shadow all three sat down for a rest
they ate some of their food washing it down with a few sips from the canteens
when the time came for them to start on again whipple and vandeever scanned the sky with ominous eyes and decided to remain where they were
the hilltops to the north were blurred with a haze of ghastly yellow
the haze thickened into an opaque curtain and drew onward with a rush
a puff of wind blistering hot stirred the sand of the valley until the ground seemed to be smoking an elegant row of stumps growled vandeever a thing like this couldnot happen only right now could it the matter queried simmons
sand storm answered whipple briefly
hug the lee of that rock simmons and pull off your coat and have it ready to put over your head
they all knelt and pushed close to the rock pinnacle
the flying sand whispered against its worn sides then as the wind increased in fury gusty blasts eddied around the huge bowlder and drove the sand stingingly against their faces
the yellow fog was all around them and the smothering heat made breathing almost impossible
with heads muffled in their coats they gasped and choked and almost stifled
the physical torment brought by the storm gave the impression that it was hours in passing but its duration could have been measured in minutes
after reaching its height it breathed itself out leaving three mounds of sand from which the travelers extricated themselves
that was shorter than usual remarked vandeever shaking the sand out of his sleeves and wiping it from his grimy face
the worst thing it did to us was to blot out the tracks of that automobile said whipple now weve got to head east and go it blind
when their packs were disinterred it was discovered that simmons canteen was missing
he could remember nothing about it
all three spent an hour kicking around in the loose sand and were compelled at last to give up the search
losing the canteen was a calamity but nothing was said by whipple or vandeever to make simmons feel worse about his carelessness than he did
they struggled on down that interminable valley their only blessing the lessening heat of the sun as it dropped toward its setting
another halt was made at sundown
the aviator by that time was in a sorry state
his eyes were puffed his tongue and lips were swollen and the last particle of energy had been sapped from his body
but there was a growing coolness in the air that was most refreshing and simmons slumped to the ground closed his eyes and slept
whipple aroused him after a while and gave him his rations from the packs
he ate gulped down the little water he was allowed to have then went to sleep again
an hour later his two companions got him to his feet once more and they continued their weary plodding onward under the brilliant arizona night sky
whipple conned their course by the stars and pressed the pace
there was now a very decided chill in the air which would have been most uncomfortable had the three travelers not been constantly moving
simmons bore up better than he had done during the day but his strength was flagging even while whipple and vandeever were going at their best no good at this he panted you fellows go on and leave me here
when you get out send somebody back to pick me up
not on your tintype sim returned the cowboy with emphasis
we all go or we all stay and thats flat
buck up
we can make five miles at night a heap easier than we can do one by day
here well help you
whipple and vandeever took turns carrying simmons pack and helping to support him
they managed to keep him on his feet until after midnight and then found further attempts useless
dropping to the ground on the very spot where simmons gave out all of them slept dog weary and worn to the point of exhaustion
they awoke with the blazing sun once more in their eyes and the blistering heat growing as the sun mounted toward the higher heavens
then began such a struggle as neither whipple nor vandeever had ever known in all their arizona years
simmons grew lightheaded and became hard to manage
he fought to get hold of the canteens and the few drops of water that remained in them he discarded his pack he sat down obstinately and refused to move in short he did everything his irrational mind suggested to delay the journey
the amalgamator and the cowboy grappled with him dragged him carried him their one consuming desire to get onward at any cost
simmons began to see visions of flowing water and green trees
he babbled about them and tried to crawl to the shelter of the groves and reach the streams
vandeever sprawled in the hot sand gave vent to a croaking laugh
he reached out gropingly with his hands my canteen he asked faintly
right in front of you there exclaimed the startled whipple you see it charley
see nothin been sun blind for an hour
poor old blue never went through anything like this oldtimer he had lost creek with him all the way
jest uncap one o the canteens will you whipple uncapped both canteens
one was dry and in the other there remained no more than a swallow of water
he pressed the canteen to lips
now you better take a swig suggested vandeever
sure said whipple and tossed the canteen away
once more vandeever laughed we the gay spenders for you he croaked hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollars in our jeans and we couldnot buy a glass o water with it
all gone you old seed you canot fool me
made me take the last drop didnot you
well thats about like you is all i can say there was no answer
with an effort vandeever got to his knees and crawled over the hot sand groping with his hands
he found what he was hunting for at last a still form crumpled and motionless
he felt the face and with his hand he patted one of the shoulders
best pard a man ever had he muttered
if heres where we take the long trail i couldnot ask for no better company rode back to consciousness on a sea of troubled dreams and a voice which had an oddly familiar sound caused him to sit up quickly and take notice
it was night one of those splendid nights for which the desert country is noted
the stars were so big and bright that it seemed as though one had only to reach out a hand in order to get hold of belt or of the big or little bear
there was a lush smell of standing water and whipple lowered his eyes and saw a goodsized water hole surrounded by a dusky chaparral of mesquite
how the moonbeams played and danced over that stretch of water in the nearer distance was a glowing camp fire
a very tall man in sharp silhouette was jerking a bag from the teeth of a scrawny cropeared burro
tossing the bag on a heap of camp plunder the man hauled the burro away on a picket rope picket you where you wonot be so handy to the grub handsome said the boss of the camp and he and the burro lost themselves temporarily in the chaparral shadows wandering glances took in his closer vicinity
vandeever lay on one side of him his eyes bandaged with a white cloth
on the other side lay simmons
hey charley called whipple softly
on deck sport answered the cowboy promptly
how you stackin up
all right
feel so comfortable a notion been watered and fed
plumb comfortable myself except my eyes
the old geezer put somethin on em and tied em up he says its a sure cure and that be able to see things by sunrise
whipple turned to the aviator
how are you sitnmons he queried
sort of hazy simmons told him had a particularly bad dream and canot remember a thing since the sand storm till i woke up here
this prospector must have found us and brought us to the water hole whipple went on what he done said vandeever he told me about that while he was bandagin my lamps
he allows we was all three purty badly done up when he happened upon us
who is he heard that voice of his before somewhere
here the tall man himself drew near and stood at side heard this bazoo of mine many a time he put in
give me a good look whipple turned his head and stared
then he his eyes and gave a gasp
uncle wes he said incredulously
well it canot be uncle wes
can it
the tall man laughed me all right
that doctor you sent down from prescott found out that my heart was as good as anybodys and that all i needed was exercise
her prescription was to stir around and be active what been doin ever since you sailed away in a flyin machine and dropped plumb off the earth
pm not feelin more than thirty years old this minute
this spell of desert ramblin has chirked me up wonderful
that lady doc doctor sure knows her business
for a minute or two whipple was so overwhelmed that he lost the power of speech
at last he found his tongue
lady doctor he echoed
is that doctor mixinger a lady
in every sense o the word declared uncle wes and shes a right competent lady if anybody wants to ask you
as soon as i found i had thirty years to live instead of only six months of course my deal with you was off
i had to get back my money before you had spent it all
believe me i did stir around i figgered that every day i lost while lookin for you cost me more than three thousand dollars
and i lost a lot of em mainly because you and your party had climbed into the sky and nobody had any idee where you had come down
the guess was pretty general that you were all killed by an accident to your machine and were lyin in the mountains somewhere
naturally i wanted to beat the coyotes to my money
monte had put up a job on you and we know about that uncle wes cut in whipple
so charley vandeever was tellin me
well the sheriff and a posse started for saddleback flats uncle wes continued and galusha mingo and katie and me we got an automobile and followed em up but katie murmured whipple
did she try to find me too never saw a girl feel so bad over anything as she did over the way you disappeared
she and galusha are still looking for you but they are staying at jimmie cabin in apache draw and doin their searchin from there
you see there was no sign of you at saddleback flats and no sign of and his crowd but we all had a notion you had been wrecked in the mountains so we began to hunt each in our different ways
i borrowed jimmie burro handsome and got a grub stake off of jimmie and put off into the hills on my own
the sheriff and his bunch are usin an automobile and galusha and daughter katie are ridin hossback
day before yesterday i hit some automobile tracks
i could tell by the treads of the tires that them tracks wasnot made by the sheriffs machine so i follered em straight into the heart of the rough country
i reckoned i was getting purty warm just when that blamed sand storm hit the hills and wiped out the automobile tracks
i made for this water hole as soon as i dug handsome and myself out of the drifted sand and pitched camp here then i strolled up that wide valley and fairly stumbled over you and your two pards
it looked for a spell as though you lay right where the flyin machine had dropped you and that about all that was left of you was reemains
but i was wrong for all three of you were alive
two swallows of water made vandeever sit up and talk then i began to get the hang o things
i was playin in great luck and you and your friends were doing the same
the suddenness with which his uncle had stepped out of the role of a confirmed invalid and spread himself over the country in active pursuit of what was left of his hundred thousand dollars was a matter of consuming wonder to whipple
now that uncle wes had a long life ahead of him nothing was more natural than that he should want his money back again should say we were in luck declared whipple
you understand got a right to take back whats left of my money
of course why uncle wes i was planning to return it to you shy something like twentyfive thousand said the old tightwad
are you willin to make it up to me a nice kind of an uncle you old skinflint yelped vandeever
after tellin to go out and spend the dinero youre now crawfishin on your own game
how can he give you back what he hasnot got an extry twenty thousand in cash in the satchel remarked uncle wes and forty thousand in liberty bonds
you canot have them uncle said whipple they belong to the eudora bank loot a reward of five thousand dollars out for capturin the robbers returned uncle wes cannily and ten per cent of all the loot recovered
that means eleven thousand cornin to you
that would help some
part of the reward goes to charley and simmons whipple told his uncle but you can have my third of it
then theres somethin else pursued uncle wes
you gave muggyone mike moloney fifty dollars and the old hassayamper used it for a grubstake drawin up an agreement with you signin it and leavin it with felix vannell at the fordham
and be blessed if muggyone didnot prance right out into the phoenix mountains and drop onto a true fissure that everybody has walked over for the last fifty years
the rock goes fifty dollars to the ton and already muggyone has been offered a big price for his find
muggyone located that prospect filed on it and had the big offer to buy all in lessn ten days fastest work on reecord and the only time in his hull rovin life that muggyone ever had any luck
it hasnot run much in his line
you three go ahead and sleep uncle wes continued goin to sit up and keep the fire blazin bright
the sheriff and his posse are trailin around in this part of the hills and tryin to signal em readin a right interestin book you had in the satchel with all that money the last writings of johnson blue
go ahead and read it urged vandeever as he fell back on the sand and turned over on his side if you wasnot such an ironclad old hiderack mebby them words of would get under your skin and do some good
but it wonot do no harm to give em a chance anyways is all a part of history now the sudden and meteoric rise of one wesley whipple who rode into phoenix one spring day scattering ballads all along the trail from the threeply mine to town
his story as one gleans it from the papers reads like a tale from the thousand and one nights
first there was uncle wesley plunkett deceiving himself with the help of doc flickinger into believing he was already climbing the foothills of the great divide and was to be over the summit in three months to a day almost to an hour
then came the queer proceeding whereby uncle wes executing a rightabout from his miserly habits gave his nephew outright one hundred thousand dollars to spend and enjoy and a few days later in a spirit of rich comedy the record tells of doctor mixinger of prescott proving to the old prospector by stern methods that his heart was all right and that he still had thirty years to live
there were chuckles in phoenix over that and more chuckles over the way old plunks went into the hills hunting for his vanished nephew and what remained of the hundred thousand
all arizona knew in due course how whipple and vandeever and their hired aviator simmons had been cast away in the mysterious lost creek canon and there had been found by hornaday and geohegan fresh from saddleback flats where they had missed a gay scheme of plunder only to connect with it again in pocket among the hills
how whipple and his comrades had turned the tables on and his men left them in the canon and almost perished on their way out of the hills were but parts of a story told over and over in store and dwelling among the mines and on the cattle ranges
and the kick which fate had put into this particular angle of the affair was wrapped up in the fact that himself was the one who had found and rescued his nephew vandeever and simmons not only getting back what remained of his money but also and this was the big the marvelous thing as it turned out finding the book of johnson blue and developing an absorbed interest in the wastrels sound philosophy
the whole southwest learned how the sheriff and posse in their flivver caught smoke signals from the camp at the water hole made for it and learned about the bank looters trapped and held in lost creek canon
vandeever his sight restored but with eyes protected by smoked glasses furnished by uncle wes piloted the law officers along the shallow valley over the ridge through the seam and so to the canon
there the wily and his two roughneck confederates were captured with very little trouble and landed behind the bars of the building in the courthouse plaza in phoenix
after the courts had dealt with them they were taken to another place of stone walls and bars for an extended stay
bad news however was current regarding mogollon mike moloney and the fiftydollar grubstake furnished by whipple
originally it had been bestowed as a free gift to an old friend but so white was moloney in his intentions that in secret he drew up a grubstake agreement and deposited it with felix vanned in trust for whipple
the mine was sold ultimately for fifty thousand dollars
of this amount however whipple received nothing as moloney lost the entire amount in settling gambling debts which he incurred on the strength of his find fifty dollars cast as bread upon the waters therefore never returned to him and the incident could not be included among the dazzling romances of the mining country
but as whipple remarked he had expected nothing and therefore could not be disappointed
the bank reward went share and share alike to whipple vandeever and simmons
and vandeever and simmons were not forgotten by whipple for when the latter bought a ranch near prescott charley van had an interest in it and acted as foreman and simmons who started wrong but caught himself up through the writings of the late johnson blue was also given a position
the right kind of prosperity dawned for everybody and seemingly it had root in that little book of johnson strangest of all perhaps was the effect the book had on wesley plunkett so fascinated was he with the weird record and its gems of wisdom that he borrowed the book and kept it for two weeks
when he returned it to his nephew he was a changed man
as doctor alfred mixinger had undeceived him regarding his health so johnson posthumous influence altered his whole conception of life
uncle wes wanted to return the seventyfive thousand dollars to whipple declaring that he had given it in good faith and should not take it back
but whipple insisted that he had no right to the money quoted blue to support his argument and refused flatly to accept it
although overruled on this point uncle wes was like the rock of gibraltar in refusing to let his nephew make up any of the amount he had spent wasnot to invest any of the hundred thousand uncle wes argued whipple but it seems that i did that unwittingly
if charley and i hadnot bought the aeroplane we should not have been cast away in lost creek canon and should not have been able to recover the banks money or get the reward for capturing and his two pals standing pat growled uncle wes obstinately book is a lesson for tightwads as well as for spendthrifts and taking my lesson to heart
from now on by gorry going to pay taxes and every cent got goes into taxable bonds
i owe that to a land that can produce a man like johnson blue
hereafter going to live like a white man
get me got my health and going after some of the brightness and happiness doctor mixinger mentioned
and theres that galusha mingo investment my boy and then the rest of it the wedding going to buy a present for that affair that will cost a wad of money it to be
here was something else again
uncle wes referred to an event that happened when whipple coming out of the hills stopped for a night at jimmie cabin in apache draw
uncle wes had to return the burro he had borrowed a longeared campraiding pack animal who was called handsome because he was so ugly
galusha mingo and katie were there it will be remembered and hence whipple was very anxious to stop
he was welcomed with open arms by mingo and with much happiness by katie
to both of them he recited the adventures that had followed his attempt to get to los angeles by aeroplane so that aided and abetted by concho charley vandeever he could spend largely and acquire most for his money
what a blessing you were wrecked in a canon commented galusha mingo where you couldnot spend a cent no you are wrong mr mingo corrected whipple the blessing came to me in the form of a book written by the late johnson blue
but well not discuss that
he finished his recital katie listening breathlessly
all very good approved galusha mingo
capturing the robbers and recovering the money has caused you to get ahead in spite of yourself
no doubt you have wondered about the ten thousand dollars which i pried out of you
well tell about that
katie and i were worried to see you spending your money so foolishly so we laid our plans to save some of it for you
with the money you let me have i bought an option on big brick block
he was hard up and eager to sell and my option called for a bargain and gave me thirty days for a turnover didnot need the thirty days he continued
in just a week i disposed of the option for twenty thousand dollars and i am holding the profit for you
it would be a start you see want you to know added mingo earnestly that i didnot take that money for myself
it was a plot of and mine to help you and i had to draw on my psychology and proceed by indirection in order to be of any assistance to you
katie has worried about that and the false position in which she has apparently placed herself talk that over said to mingo
suppose we take a walk down the draw katie he asked
they took their walk and by a spring under a cottonwood tree they sat down and katie began to speak of mamie and lorena want to tell you about mamie and lorena katie whipple interrupted
if you will remember i met those two girls at a party at your house
you introduced me to them
whenever i came into town with a little money to spend mamie and lorena were all for helping me get rid of it while you were always asking me to put it in the bank or pay my debts
well you know debts never bothered me much
i was always for letting the other fellow worry
too free and easy you understand but with not a desire to beat anybody out of what was his just due
i just couldnot seem to get the hang of that
i wanted a lot and thirty a week wonot go very far
your constant talk of saving rather jarred on me so i turned to mamie and lorena
there i made my big mistake
that night i plunged with you to the extent of fifteen dollars and forty cents and you called me down oh very nicely for doing it i felt as though all the fun had been taken out of the evening
but always i want you to know i had a thousand thoughts of katie mingo where i had one of mamie or lorena how i felt deep down in my heart
there was that in his eyes at this moment which brought a vivid flush to cheeks
and when he took her hand she did not withdraw it was worried over there in lost creek canon katie whipple went on
you see johnson blue when he was a bookkeeper at a hundred a month lost his heart to a girl named ethel the only part of her name that appears in his book
just ethel if i had the full name and address go personally to tell ethel what happened to johnson blue
well when blue got his million dollars from his uncle and began having high jinks with it it appears that ethel reproved him for his spendthrift habits just as you reproved me i imagine
and blue felt annoyed and went his own way and finally found himself a prisoner in lost creek canon with only eighteen cents in his pocket and the girl whom he loved married to a better man what worried me there in the canon katie
what if you married a better man while i was reading johnson blue and seeing the error of my ways and making a firm resolution to be different if i ever got out of that pocket
what if wesley said katie softly it wasnot possible
what wasnot possible demanded whipple a wild suspicion stabbing at his heart
why answered katie her eyes lowered that i could marry a better man than than you
the wild suspicion that katie might be pledged to another at once took wings
and will you marry me katie asked whipple have prospects now and thanks to johnson blue i can be all that your father would have me
katie look up
tell me if i am going to be the happiest man that ever lived what katie said it is not necessary to put down here for her answer stood revealed in that question of uncle the wedding
whipple very joyfully told him when was the wedding and uncle wes shook his hand hard the girl i had picked for you all along he averred
she hasnot been proud of old plunks in the past i reckon but thats all going to be changed from now on
and some day j he added earnestly want you to take me to lost creek canon
what for asked whipple curiously want to put a tendollar wreath on the grave of johnson blue was the answer
and that to any one who had known the old uncle wes was something for him to say
