that leak be through the stovepipe hole in the blizzard office 
guy have four hour and a half at -PRON- disposal before the freight train leave concord and -PRON- make up -PRON- mind that -PRON- would put in the time look over the town 
before descend the decrepit stair lead from the blizzard office -PRON- linger at the top to scan the three point of the compass that be open to -PRON- 
as the building occupy by the newspaper be well at the foot of the main thoroughfare nearly the whole of concord lie under the young man eye 
certainly no eulogy be to be waste upon that collection of house and store 
the princi pal street have road debouch to left and right 
building be not huddle together on the con trary -PRON- be far apart with stretch of virgin prairie between -PRON- 
-PRON- have be the policy of the townsite company to donate a lot in each block in the residence portion to any one who would build a house upon -PRON-

why gasp barney level -PRON- finger that there silence roar vlandingham knock the extended arm downward

the captain and mr boomer part and allow -PRON- to pass mr boomer finger -PRON- revolver nervously 
the guard in the passageway eye -PRON- keenly and the man with the rifle at the foot of the stair suffer -PRON- to depart without a word 
when -PRON- be well on -PRON- way to willowview barney find -PRON- tongue 
well dinge -PRON- mutter the spy ainot -PRON- the man describe in the note answer guy who do not relish the harsh term 
at that precise moment -PRON- be wish col keever at the antipode

-PRON- ring be answer by miss betty -PRON- 
mr herbert -PRON- exclaim smilingly know very well that father wouldnot allow -PRON- to be hurt

why be -PRON- here barney 
the squire send -PRON- along to see that -PRON- didnot get away respond barney valiantly 
well -PRON- neednot remain see that -PRON- doesnot get away 
good night 
the door be close in the astounded face 
come into the parlor mr herbert say miss betty 
guy couldnot understand the situation at all 
-PRON- friend the enemy miss betty do not seem to abate one jot or tittle of -PRON- friendliness consummate actress guy think the storm will come before long 
miss betty motion towards a chair 
after guy have obediently seat -PRON- -PRON- take a rocker visavis 
-PRON- think for a moment and then laugh softly 
to think -PRON- remark that neither father nor on hear -PRON- name ever think of connect -PRON- with mr montfort herbert of the concord townsite company and -PRON- board that freight train at concord too why donot -PRON- denounce -PRON- for be a spy ask guy impatiently 
why should i denounce -PRON- 
concord be -PRON- town mr herbert and -PRON- be right for -PRON- to do what -PRON- can to hold the countyseat 
harmony be -PRON- town and -PRON- shall do what -PRON- can to take the countyseat away from -PRON- sorry for -PRON- for your be a lose fight 
yet there be mean -PRON- would not counte nance even in a struggle of this kind will have no violence 
that be why i add a line to the note which barney bring from concord 
that line have escape guy 
-PRON- take the note from -PRON- pocket and see pencil dimly at the bottom the word see that no harm come to mr herbertbetty -PRON- draw a deep breath 
then i have -PRON- to thank for -PRON- present safety say -PRON- replace the note in -PRON- pocket 
a friend in need please donot misunderstand -PRON- mr herbert return miss betty 
-PRON- father rule passion be real estate 
-PRON- want to sell -PRON- some lot in harmony and for fear -PRON- wouldnot be where -PRON- could watch -PRON- -PRON- insist on have -PRON- come here 
that be also -PRON- reason for take -PRON- to the meeting and -PRON- have not the slight notion -PRON- be harbor an enemy 
miss betty laugh again 
at heart -PRON- resume -PRON- father be one of the noble man in the world but i can not remember that -PRON- ever champion a losing cause 
whenever -PRON- enter a fight -PRON- go in to win 
with -PRON- aid -PRON- be go to be victorious in this countyseat affair 
-PRON- speak decisively donot know -PRON- real motive for come here but i presume -PRON- want to look over the rival town and find out what chance there be for concord retain -PRON- prestige 
that be partly -PRON- admit guy 
but i also wish to attend the meeting and find out if i could what move -PRON- side intend to make 
col keever suggest that do -PRON- not 
-PRON- be suggest to -PRON- 
and -PRON- endeavor to follow out this counsel against -PRON- well judgment be very sorry now that i act on the sug gestion at all 
-PRON- be too much of a gentleman for this sort of work mr herbert 
a countyseat contest of this kind be a very disagreeable affair 
why should there ever have be a contest 
-PRON- friend the enemy that be because concord steal the county seat away from harmony in the first place 
the vote be close and the canvass board buy by col keever throw out a sufficient number of harmony vote to give the countyseat to con cord 
the blue eye snap and the thin nos tril dilate 
for this reason the question have be reopen mr herbert and -PRON- be for this reason also that i be heart and soul in the conflict 
i will have no violence but col keever may have to be meet with -PRON- own weapon in order that right and justice may prevail 
-PRON- can be good enemy and good friend as well and after the will try to forget the disagreeable incident of the campaign 
with all -PRON- heart declare guy 
-PRON- offer -PRON- -PRON- hand and -PRON- press the little palm cordially 
at that moment -PRON- hear run foot along the road by the gate angry shout and now and then the report of a revolver 
betty spring up and hurry to a window a mob in front -PRON- say quietly but -PRON- need have no fear mr herbert 
-PRON- be just as safe under this roof as -PRON- would be in concord 
guy greatly admire -PRON- calmness but -PRON- un derestimate -PRON- courage if -PRON- think for a moment that -PRON- be frightened 
before -PRON- could reply squire vlandingham hurry into the room come from the rear of the house 
a friend in need get a horse at the barn herbert all saddle bridle and wait say -PRON- quickly donot want to alarm -PRON- but some of those rascal out there be drunk and barney have tell -PRON- everything better go i may be powerless to protect -PRON- 
some one jangle the bell furiously 
a scuffling of foot and muttering of hoarse voice come from the porch 
there -PRON- be say betty 
-PRON- talk with -PRON- at the door father while i show mr -PRON- bert where -PRON- can find the horse 
vlandingham start for the hall but pause to reach out -PRON- hand to guy donot believe -PRON- know what kind of a hor net nest -PRON- be go to get into over here herbert get betty on -PRON- side i can see that and i donot lie up any hard feeling advise -PRON- though to give this burg a wide berth in future 
-PRON- see i hold the win card in this fight and can afford to be magnani mous 
guy wrung hand and follow betty outside to a post where a horse be hitch 
untie the halter -PRON- vault into the saddle 
betty direct -PRON- how to go hope i shall see -PRON- again miss vlande ham -PRON- observe 
-PRON- may see -PRON- when -PRON- least expect -PRON- -PRON- answer will send the horse back tomorrow 
5o -PRON- friend the enemy any time that -PRON- find -PRON- convenient will be soon enough 
remember -PRON- be enemy on countyseat matter 
and friend on all other 
if -PRON- wish -PRON- do wish -PRON- 
good bye 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand and -PRON- speed away into the night 
guy have a lonely ride back to concord over the broad flat starlit land 
-PRON- could see the road dimly a lightish streak cut the dark turf of the plain 
a moist lush smell arise from the dewy grass and the croaking of frog the chirping of cricket and the resonant boom of the bittern float from the sedge serve only to intensify the stillness 
there be far more to this countyseat business than guy have imagine 
miss betty feel that harmony have be cheat out of -PRON- right and that be the cause of -PRON- inexorable stand in the present contest of the voter in the county have sign the petition for a special elec tion and -PRON- be a foregone conclusion that these twothird would vote for harmony 
without doubt this be the premise on which squire vlan dingham and -PRON- daughter be build -PRON- hope 
-PRON- ground be well take but guy have information relative to col import voter 
-PRON- do not know what the voting strength of the county be but -PRON- be sure the colonel have be sharp enough to bring in suffi -PRON- friend the enemy cient ballot to overcome the twothird majority 
the young man do not fancy this phase of the question although the entire contest be gradu ally present -PRON- to -PRON- as a case of diamond cut diamond 
-PRON- have be bring up in abhor rence of way that be dark and trick that be vain but now that -PRON- be in rome why should -PRON- not emulate the roman 
to take any other stand be equivalent to bankrupt -PRON- for what chance would concord have if -PRON- order the import voter out of the town or per mitte -PRON- to exercise the right of franchise un influence 
if order away -PRON- may flock to harmony in a body and if permit to vote as -PRON- please -PRON- may be subsidize by agent of vlandingham 
the matter be a delicate one and to be handle with extreme caution 
the temptation to look out for -PRON- at all cost be a powerful one and have not miss betty -PRON- self say that -PRON- be right for -PRON- to do all -PRON- could to keep the countyseat at concord 
tak e everything into consideration guy think -PRON- would be well to lay back on -PRON- oar watch the opposition and see what happen 
-PRON- have a number of thought concern miss betty entirely apart from the political question and in the fair field where -PRON- be to esteem each other as friend 
these be headstrong fancy and so vividly tint with the hue of youth that -PRON- be more properly dream and not to be chronicle 
concord invade arrive in concord guy leave the horse at the livery barn and make -PRON- way along the dark and deserted street to the lisbon house 
this hotel be under the proprietorship of a portuguese 
be unable to pronounce -PRON- name the people of concord rise up and bestow upon -PRON- the patronymic of smith 
retain -PRON- multitude of christian name -PRON- full title thus become pedro fernandez jos manuel smith 
this be of course altogether too long for a pioneer community and when pedro fernandez be not plain smith -PRON- be pedro or cinch which be practically the same 
almost any day pedro may be see sit in front of -PRON- establishment wear -PRON- white apron and square white cap -PRON- leg cross elbow on -PRON- knee complacently swinge -PRON- suspend foot and puff at a corncob pipe 
-PRON- be thus that guy find the proprietor when -PRON- come out from breakfast on the morning after -PRON- ride from harmony 
the early train from the west have just stop at the station as guy take a chair on the porch and light a cigar 
quite an excitement when the train come in observed pedro 
so -PRON- seem return guy look at the little throng which have gather on the platform and part of which be visible around the end of the station building 
-PRON- see mr glimmer and lemuel bilkin among other and give especial -PRON- friend the enemy attention to a slender youth whose fiery hair curl fringingly about the edge of -PRON- old cap 
this latter individual be throw a canvas bag into the open door of the mail car 
sampson venture pedro note the direction of gaze 
work for the colonel and be just throw on the eastbound bundle of this week blizzard a copy of -PRON- if -PRON- would like to run -PRON- over a mighty warm number countyseat war be gettin interestin 
pedro pull the paper out from under -PRON- apron and guy examine -PRON- lazily 
there be a redhot leader in the scorch style pick the county commissioner to tatter and then hold e these remnant up to public contumely 
the intrinsic value of the article do not interest guy quite so much as something else 
-PRON- bring out the note which squire vlandingham have hand -PRON- at the town meeting the night beforea scrap which -PRON- be treasure simply and solely because of miss pencil message to -PRON- father at the bottom of -PRON- 
turn the note over -PRON- peruse the writing on the back as -PRON- have do once before that morning 
the chirography be a blot scrawl and the ink be purple in color 
guy remember that the ink which the colonel have jar out of -PRON- stand on the precede afternoon be of that identical hue 
yet this be not all 
the writing on the back of that note be the counterpart of a frac tion of the leader word for word comma for concord invade comma and exclamation point for exclamation point 
have guy a piece of the copy in -PRON- hand 
be this a clue to the identity of the broom man mention by barney break from pedro smith as -PRON- get up from -PRON- chair 
here come three passen ger from the west 
-PRON- donot get many from that direction 
guy thrust the note back into -PRON- pocket and look towards the station 
the train have go and the curious citizen be head back towards the business section of the town 
lemuel be carry the mailsack for mr a task which -PRON- perform proudly and regularly for the mere glory of -PRON- sampson a little time at -PRON- disposal now that the week issue be out of the way have light a cigarette and be saunter leisurely mr glimmer have be expect -PRON- wifes sister from bismarck and -PRON- can not be say that -PRON- wear a very disappointed look because -PRON- have fail to arrive waffle be of the party and -PRON- shadow bill comfort and several more 
the attention of the group of citizen be rivet upon the three arrival who walk in advance and head for the hotel 
two of these be woman ostensibly sister of charity and closely veiled 
the third be a man under medium height and envelop from head to heel in a garment that be much too large for -PRON- 
-PRON- hat be draw down over -PRON- forehead and the collar of -PRON- illfitting coat be turn up -PRON- friend the enemy about -PRON- ear 
the attire be exceedingly warm for that season of the year and sampson guy the stranger in frequent aside to lem bilkin 
the sister of charity pass into the hotel usher by the obsequious pedro 
the little man in the long coat likewise enter the office and take a seat in one corner rigidly erect and not deign to unbutton -PRON- coat 
the citizen halt in front of the veranda to stare and specu lateall save bilkin who be due at the post office 
cracky exclaim sampson look hard at guy 
the printer start to say something more but bite -PRON- word off short the matter ask guy wonder at the mystify expression of the youth face 
oh nothing reply sampson back away 
-PRON- dear herbert l coo the familiar voice of col keever as that gentleman round the corner of the hotel and advance upon guy precipitately 
-PRON- look well add the colonel significantly drop a hand on the young man shoulder 
then -PRON- stoop and whisper how do -PRON- come out

look 
guy wave the key 
-PRON- have lock col dingle in a closet and if -PRON- will appoint someone to guard -PRON- some one whom -PRON- can all trust -PRON- will proceed to debate this question and decide as dispassionately as -PRON- can what shall be do with -PRON- prisoner be like ravening of the prove that -PRON- be reasonable being 
let -PRON- go down into the office and reason together 
herbert have get the right end of the stick second judge waffle lift up -PRON- voice from the top of the office counter 
do as -PRON- say and let have a concensus of opinion 
that be -PRON- wish shout col keever from the foot of the stair

concord invade to have -PRON- leader add -PRON- personal request settle the matter and the riotous citizen on the stair begin to descend 
who shall guard the prisoner ask guy 
mr pedro smith no thunder keever let sampson stand in the hall before the door 
sampson push up the stair with alacrity take the key from hand and proceed at once to -PRON- post 
when all the other be on the office floor a debate as to the punishment which should be mete out to col dingle be at once begin 
a few suggest hang in no equivocal term a large number be of the opinion that tar and feather be as far as -PRON- should go while a conservative element believe that col dingle would suffer sufficient punishment if -PRON- be set astride a pole and ridden out of town 
there be but one point on which the agreement be anything like be unanimous and that be that dingle before -PRON- be deal with in any manner whatever should go down on -PRON- knee to col keever and implore -PRON- pardon 
guy be against this and so be waffle and of course bill comfort 
argument pro and con come fast and furious and an hour pass with out bring the dissent faction any closer together than -PRON- be at first 
misunderstand ing begin to crop out and more than one harsh word be bandy back and forth 
-PRON- friend the enemy just when -PRON- seem that the wrangle citizen would come to blow a despair cry for help float down from upstairs 
-PRON- be voice what have happen 
in a flash every voice be hush and the crowd catch -PRON- breath 
then come the slamming of a door follow by a crashing sound and a hollow groan 
guy lead the rush for the second story and find when -PRON- reach the top of the stair that the closet door be ajar the prisoner go and sampson lie in a huddled heap on the floor without sound or movement 
the astounded citizen look from one to an other and as -PRON- look the swift fall of a horse hoof echo up from the street accom panie by a shrill and triumphant yell 
with one accord the crowd flock to the window and catch a fleeting glimpse of col dingle careering madly in the direction of harmony 
-PRON- be mount on the horse which guy have ride the night before and be wave over -PRON- head the weathervane that have be recently affix to the roof of the new courthouse 
the citizen of concord be stupefy 
that weathervane be a symbol of -PRON- defiance of the other town and to have the hate dingle come brazenly among -PRON- insult -PRON- leader in a peculiarly irritate manner escape mysteriously while -PRON- be wrangle over the method of -PRON- punishment and flee with that grotesque gal vanize iron figure wave over -PRON- head be enough to paralyze the most rabid partisan 
christopher waffle be a concord man to the marrow of -PRON- bone but -PRON- have no love for col because the colonel have once overcharge -PRON- for a threshing ad 
nor have waffle admire the handiwork as exem plifie in the weathervane

enough of this say -PRON- 
-PRON- have a power ful enemy in vlandingham and -PRON- can not hope to win unless -PRON- present an undivided front 
instead of contend among -PRON- suppose -PRON- inquire into the method of col escape 
and be forget about -PRON- 
-PRON- may be severely hurt 
this be sufficient to turn the attention of the crowd into another channel and guy lead the back ward movement along the hall to the spot where the unfortunate printer be lie 
sampson have not move a hair breadth 
-PRON- be flat on -PRON- back -PRON- arm and leg sprawl out and -PRON- eye close

remember that i be here in the interest of harmony and that -PRON- be -PRON- duty to look out for concord 
with that -PRON- turn away and guy follow sampson out of the room 
col keever be tremendously work up 
-PRON- be pace the restrict limit of -PRON- office and toss -PRON- arm and talk to -PRON- so wrath fully oblivious of -PRON- surrounding that -PRON- do not notice the entrance of guy and sampson for several moment 
occasionally the colonel would halt glower at a copy hook fasten to the wall shake -PRON- fist at -PRON- and address -PRON- by such term as infernal scoundrel contemptible cur and so on 
fi nally -PRON- jerk the hook from the wall cast -PRON- on the floor and set -PRON- heel on the sheet that be string upon -PRON-

knock -PRON- down say guy promptly and that s what any man with an ordinary temper would do 
but that would only be a halfway measure with -PRON- 
i presume -PRON- notice that i do not knock dingle down do be the dry response restrain -PRON- hold -PRON- in check in col flash in the pan order that i may take a more terrible vengeance 
herbert i be go to have life l -PRON- certainly be not there there try to argue with -PRON- for -PRON- be useless utterly useless

i count that day lose herbert which pass without -PRON- call some one out 
the colonel pull the brim of -PRON- white top hat firmly down over -PRON- brow 
in -PRON- estimation a stiff white hat be the acme of gentility the crown and symbol of a gentleman 
a stiff white hat moreover throw about -PRON- wearer a political glamour which be something not to be ignore by the editor of that justly celebrate sheet the concord blizzard 
the colonel not only pull down the brim of -PRON- hat but -PRON- button the two low button of -PRON- frock coat across -PRON- capacious stomach rest one elbow on the top of -PRON- desk and swing -PRON- caneswung -PRON- slowly and relentlessly

-PRON- be very unkind and ungrateful of -PRON- mr herbert face have become almost as white as miss do -PRON- think for a moment -PRON- gasp that i would do such a dastardly thing 
who else could have do -PRON- 
-PRON- look at -PRON- hopefully ask with -PRON- eye as plainly as eye could ask anything that -PRON- lift -PRON- from the depth to which -PRON- have fall in -PRON- estimation 
-PRON- seem to have no regard for the peril of -PRON- position appear to desire only an explana tion and half fear -PRON- could not give -PRON- 
-PRON- be do by some one else say guy in desperate earnest 
take -PRON- word for -PRON- 
an explanation would consume too much time and endanger -PRON- chance of escape 
i have have that carriage make ready for -PRON-

as soon as those man find -PRON- be not at the hotel -PRON- will go elsewhere to look for -PRON-

barney say guy a man whom -PRON- can trust implicitly 
lois say miss betty get into the carriage 
i think -PRON- be mistaken about mr herbert 
anyway i shall stay here long enough to make sure 
-PRON- friend the enemy miss pinkney leave hurriedly and miss betty again turn to guy 
-PRON- be too bad that the high opinion -PRON- some time form of people on first acquaintance should be overthrow say -PRON- and i be very much disappointed when force to the conclusion that -PRON- have tell of -PRON- presence here 
now tell -PRON- truly mr herbert be not this a little plan of -PRON- to get -PRON- to leave concord without ac complishe the work that bring -PRON- here 
great heaven no cried guy 
-PRON- would have be a very clever plan -PRON- go on demurely 
have a carriage ready -PRON- know tell the populace send -PRON- rush away on a wrong scent and thus make -PRON- glad of the opportunity to avail -PRON- of the carriage which -PRON- refuse this morning 
as a ruse -PRON- would have be wait any longer implored guy fancy i can hear -PRON- pursuer come 
-PRON- bend -PRON- head listeningly 
no not yet -PRON- answer lightly 
who be -PRON- tell of -PRON- man who will never again go back to har mony

i refuse to purchase -PRON- information but col keever pay for -PRON- and i hear what -PRON- have to say 
i have do what i could for -PRON- miss vlandingham know -PRON- mr herbert and in order that -PRON- a narrow escape work may not have be do in vain i be go e 
i have perform the mission that bring -PRON- here so look out for a master stroke on the part of harmony 
-PRON- flash a bright smile at -PRON- and be out of the building and into the carriage before -PRON- could reach -PRON- side and give -PRON- any assistance 
barney use -PRON- whip and just as -PRON- team start along the street towards the railroad track col keever and -PRON- follower break from the hotel and race back in the direction of the blizzard office 
guy halt stock still and hold -PRON- breath 
the carriage be upon the man and almost past -PRON- before any attention be pay to -PRON- 
-PRON- be the fortune to catch first sight of the lady who be lean back on the rear seat in the shelter of the side curtain 
there -PRON- be cry keever team stop that catch the horse head but barney ply the lash vigorously and before the companion be able to act on -PRON- warning the carriage be beyond -PRON- all and whirl -PRON- passenger rapidly away 
the road to harmony lead past the depot across the railroad track and then bear off to the left 
with a fresh team and a good start there be no doubt that barney would have distance -PRON- pur suer have not the road be unexpectedly block 
the noon train suddenly draw up to the depot platform 
-PRON- be a long train and so completely 9o -PRON- friend the enemy obstruct the way that there be no get around -PRON- without turn squarely about and retrace the street for a full block 
such a move would have be disastrous for the pursuer be not more than a hundred yard behind 
a yell of triumph go up from the throat of col keever and -PRON- man 
guy start at a run for the scene 
before -PRON- come anywhere near the carriage however -PRON- see miss vlandingham and miss pinkney descend from -PRON- and hurry to the train 
a brakeman help -PRON- up the step of the near car signal go ahead to the conductor and the latter give the word to the engineer

-PRON- look around at command and the sight of the gun stagger -PRON- shoot donot shoot -PRON- cry frantically and spring to the ground lose -PRON- footing fall flat and roll over and over in the dust of the road sho will or keever col train that off drop guy have come up with the baffled crowd just in time to witness the discomfiture 
-PRON- experience a sense of great relief at the escape of miss betty and -PRON- friend and keep -PRON- as much in the background as possible when the irate citizen rush forward and assist petti bone to set -PRON- leader upright and dust -PRON- off have the law on -PRON- sir rage the colonel break through the crowd that sur round -PRON- and shake -PRON- fist at barney 
threaten -PRON- hey 
egad -PRON- make -PRON- blood l get excited colonel shout barney from the carriage 
excite -PRON- impudent puppy 
excited pet tibone arrest that man surprised that -PRON- stand there without raise a finger against the young scalawag 
the town have only one fault to find with dick pettibone and that be that -PRON- be too easy go too good natured 
there be spartan fibre run through -PRON- makeup but -PRON- be in evidence only on extreme occasion 
oh i wouldnot make -PRON- any trouble col -PRON- friend the enemy onel return pettibone soothingly young -PRON- know and all young man be more or less headstrong a traitor fume the colonel 
if -PRON- hadnot be for -PRON- daughter wouldnot have slip through -PRON- finger think -PRON- would colonel 
no sir rave the colonel 
arrest that young rapscallion or chastise -PRON- here and now 
the colonel begin to roll up -PRON- coat sleeve and barney coolly eye -PRON- make a wry grim ace 
lay the shotgun down on the seat barney attempt to turn the carriage and drive off 
by this time however the word have have an effect on -PRON- follower and two of -PRON- catch the horse head 
pettibone see that there be nothing for -PRON- to do but to act in -PRON- official capacity order barney to get down 
barney obey without any show of resistance and pettibone march off with -PRON- while mr glimmer take the team and carriage back to the livery stable 
during all this time guy have be overlook 
-PRON- remain in the vicinity long enough to note the outcome of the exciting little drama and then slip quietly away to the hotel 
-PRON- be there an hour later deeply engage in a st paul paper when a nervous little gentleman wear a pair of nose glass be lead up to -PRON- by pedro smith 
the key to the situation mr herbert say pedro mr pinchbeck 
mr pinchbeck have recently interest -PRON- in -PRON- little city and -PRON- wish to talk with -PRON- concern the outlook 
guy shake hand with mr pinchbeck and the latter seat -PRON- at the young man side while pedro drift away towards the kitchen understand that -PRON- own nearly all the vacant lot in this town mr herbert observe mr pinchbeck catch -PRON- glass as -PRON- drop from -PRON- nose 
guy nod 
have -PRON- buy here recently -PRON- ask 
quite recently 
very much blockconditionally 
mr pinchbeck catch -PRON- glass again fit -PRON- carefully to the bridge of -PRON- nose and wrinkle -PRON- brow a time or two to satisfy -PRON- that -PRON- would hold be to pay for the block provid e this town win the countyseat fight 
ah i see 
-PRON- money be to be pay back if -PRON- lose hasnot really be pay over as yet 
i have merely a contract for a deed this way mr herbert 
when the ballot be count if -PRON- show a good safe majority for concord i be to pay to the workman who have be bring here to build road bridge etc and i be also to pay for that wooden shell which be ultimately to be the courthouse 
-PRON- friend the enemy this be a revelation to guy 
here be the tenderfoot about whom the colonel have tell -PRON- 
the colonel however have say nothing of a conditional bargain 
in case -PRON- lose the countyseat mr pinch beck say guy what would happen 
mr pinchbeck smile 
the mirthful wrinkle disconnect -PRON- glass and -PRON- evade -PRON- hand and drop into -PRON- lap 
the smile fade into a look of vexation as -PRON- pick up the glass and jam -PRON- back on the bridge of -PRON- nose all right mr herbert 
i have a con tract with vlandingham for a block at the same figure in case -PRON- town win 
guy be startle 
have mr vlandingham also import some voter -PRON- ask donot know as i ought to say so but -PRON- have run in a lot of fellow from bismarck the same number that keever have bring in from jimtown work somewhere around harmony and will be in evidence on elec tion day 
in se harmony win -PRON- be go to pay workman 
be that -PRON- -PRON- 
col keever say -PRON- be a tenderfoot mr pinchbeck but -PRON- certainly do not act like one 
no matter from which direction the breeze come -PRON- have an anchor to windward just plain business that s all return the key to the situation mr pinchbeck dash -PRON- hand to -PRON- face barely in time to keep -PRON- glass there 
be squire vlandingham also build a court house 
i drive over from harmony this morning and see vlandingham before i start get something up -PRON- sleeve 
i hardly know what though 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that fool build court house and wise man occupy -PRON- 
i donot know as i ought to tell -PRON- this be a noncom batant as -PRON- may say but i guess -PRON- wonot do any harm 
vlandingham be a deep one but -PRON- daughter be deep still 
what do -PRON- know about miss vlandingham ask guy with sudden interest 
mr pinchbeck start to answer but have to pause to grab -PRON- glass again 
why donot -PRON- get a cord add guy somewhat testily 
eh 9y tie -PRON- on continued guy point to the glass 
if -PRON- be mine -PRON- would give -PRON- ner vous prostration 
i donot know but -PRON- will anyhow get so mad sometimes admit mr pinch beck that i feel as though i could swear 
-PRON- put the glass in -PRON- pocket 
nearsighte -PRON- know and canot tell a dog from a wildcat across the street be ask what -PRON- know about miss vlandingham say guy 
so -PRON- be 
miss vlandingham mr herbert -PRON- friend the enemy be one of the clever young woman i have ever see 
-PRON- mind be by far the bright of any in the rival town give -PRON- the fight of -PRON- life and incline to think that -PRON- town will win a girl of infinite resource and that episode of this morning clearly illustrate the spectacular way -PRON- have of do thing 
gra cious think of a woman don a disguise and come deliberately into a hotbed of partisanship like this mr pinchbeck seem so overcome by the thought that -PRON- find -PRON- impossible to con tinue for several moment 
-PRON- be a young man without much experience mr herbert -PRON- say finally and like to give -PRON- a word of advice 
will -PRON- accept -PRON- in a kindly spirit 
certainly mr pinchbeck 
what have -PRON- to offer 
amityville be the key to this countyseat situa tion 
one lot of import voter will offset the other and as amityville go so go the election 
do -PRON- catch on think i do 
personally i have little choice between con cord and harmony 
still -PRON- profit if this town be victorious will be slightly great as the block be four lot large 
hence this tip mr herbert 
get a county map and study -PRON- 
mr pinchbeck get up walk over to the cigar case and take out a cigar lay a nickel in the box for such purpose make and provide 
the principle of gain be too firmly work the key to the situation into mr nature for guy to estimate -PRON- very highly as a man but -PRON- have furnish the youth with a good deal of mental pabulum 
every makeshift and design in the rival town appear to cluster about the personality of miss bettymiss betty with -PRON- titian hair and melt e eyesas dauntless as -PRON- be charming as brave as -PRON- be resourceful 
-PRON- have meet col most diplomatic move bring in voter from bismarck to offset those from jamestown 
the contest be assume proportion which make guy extremely doubtful of the result 
miss betty be likely to win the countyseat away from -PRON- and -PRON- heart along with -PRON- 
after an hour of fruitless reflection guy borrow a county map of pedro fortify -PRON- with a good cigar and go up to -PRON- room to consider the question of amityville 
this village be the only other town in goodwill county 
a marginal note on the map inform guy that -PRON- population be only about thirty five 
these thirtyfive be undoubtedly favorable to harmony for amityville lie to the west of that town and consequently nearer to -PRON- than to concord 
in order for harmony to present a peti tion contain the name of twothird of the qualified voter in the county amityville must have sign -PRON- to a man 
here be a good field for effort guy think 
why could -PRON- not go over there and talk to the people 
-PRON- come to a conclusion just as the supper bell rang 
-PRON- be -PRON- friend the enemy thoroughly determine to go to amityville in the course of a few day and try -PRON- hand at elec tioneering 
when -PRON- come out of -PRON- room -PRON- see pettibone sit in the hall beside -PRON- door 
the young man be surprised at the sheriff presence but make no comment 
what do -PRON- do with barney mr petti bone ask guy confine in a room over that -PRON- use as a jail to be do with -PRON- 
judge waffle will have to decide that 
pettibone be most companionable 
-PRON- not only accompany guy downstairs but sit at table with -PRON- during supper follow -PRON- out on the porch for an evening smoke chat with -PRON- until bedtime and then accompany -PRON- up stair again to -PRON- room 
a cot be stand in the hall beside door in place of the chair 
see here pettibone say guy a nice fellow and all that but donot -PRON- think -PRON- be crowd -PRON- pretty close 
well no answer pettibone after a brief period of thought 
what do this mean any way 
the colonel and a lot more didnot like the way -PRON- carry on this morning and -PRON- want -PRON- to lock -PRON- up along with barney 
but i tell -PRON- no 
then -PRON- insist that i should have to watch -PRON- and be responsible for -PRON- if the key to the situation i didnot put -PRON- under lock and key 
i say all right and that s why here a good feller as -PRON- have just be kind enough to say and dead sure -PRON- be another so be go to get along without any friction ainot -PRON- try to laugh guy 
and in the morning continue pettibone go to the circus 
circus echo guy 
what circus petti bone 
well the case of keever vs liscomb be go to be try before judge waffle and if -PRON- donot have a show with all but the ring and the canvas miss -PRON- guess 
guy bid the sheriff goodnight and go into the room and close the door 
the people of -PRON- own town have turn against -PRON- the matter be become interesting and the interest be likely to increase instead diminish of on the following morning shortly before the judicial hour of ten guy and pettibone proceed to the building contain the drug store and ascend to the second story 
here be the court room and likewise the small apartment utilize as a jail 
unlock the door of the latter chamber pettibone request barney to come forth 
the prisoner obey and when -PRON- see guy -PRON- press close to -PRON- and ask in a low tone while the sheriff busy -PRON- relocke the door do -PRON- give -PRON- away 
no replied guy and i will not 
if -PRON- can get clear barney go back to harmony and stay there 
that will be the safe and good thing -PRON- can do 
barney nod as the sheriff join -PRON- and -PRON- start for the courtroom 
as have be state christopher waffle own a threshing outfit 
-PRON- profession be that of an itinerant thresher of grain incidentally as will be remember -PRON- be also justice of the peace 
there be in christopher waffle a certain warmth of originality and sharpness of purpose i -PRON- friend the enemy that have earn -PRON- the sobriquet of hot waffle 
but christopher waffle care not for public opinion good or ill 
-PRON- make -PRON- -PRON- ex clusive aim to please waffle and thus be always sure of be on good term with -PRON- whatever may be the state of -PRON- feeling toward the rest of mankind 
when guy barney and pettibone enter the room the judge have not yet arrive 
col keever be there however -PRON- white hat severely set upon -PRON- ample browsmute testimony of -PRON- mental condition 
there also be lem bilkin twist about a chair in close proximity to the colonel and watch -PRON- every movement with an admiration that be almost soulful 
glimmer be glimmer have agree to look after the emporium during -PRON- absenceand pinney the druggist and leffingwell proprietor of the livery stable and sampson and mr barberry who be suppose to be a lawyer and who pos sesse a painfully meagre form a hatchet face have an impediment in -PRON- speech and have be retain by the defense 
other be present but none especially noteworthy 
the buzz of conver sation cease abruptly upon the coming of the sheriff with -PRON- prisonersfor -PRON- be plain that guy be consider in the light of a malefactor spare the odium of imprisonment merely because of pettibone and upon the latter responsibility 
frigid look be direct at guy by every one exceptstrange as -PRON- may appearthe redoubt keever versus liscomb io3 able colonel 
the manager of the townsite com pany have sleep upon the incident of the precede afternoon and have come to the conclusion that -PRON- have be somewhat hasty with guy 
solely by grace of the young man -PRON- be direct the affair of the town 
the office be no sinecure but if concord win in the contest -PRON- paper would boom and -PRON- nest would be feather in other way 
for these reason the glance -PRON- shoot in direction be of the sorrowful and injure butforgiving kind 
a chair a table a glass and a broken water pitcher be await the judge who finally ar rive

the sheriff fish a fold paper out of -PRON- pocket and guy open the sheet and read as follow concord june mr richard pettibone sheriff of goodwill county concord dear sir one who cherish the law as the dear of -PRON- country institution and who have become aware of a terrible crime about to be commit come to -PRON- with these present assert that challenge and acceptance to fight a duel have pass between two of the most worthy people of goodwill county

this affair of honor unless thwart by exercise of -PRON- authority will take place at oclock in dilemma the afternoon of wednesday june on the north shore of lake elizabeth 
if -PRON- have a decent regard for the peace and wellbeing of this community let -PRON- supplicate -PRON- forthwith to take such step as may seem advisable for avert an impending catastrophe 
proceed to the scene of this intend crime and resort to force if necessary in overturn the sanguinary plan of the duellist 
this state plainly enough that the two col onel be the principal in the affair say guy 
the fact of this propose duel be no news to -PRON- however as i already have knowledge of -PRON- from col keever -PRON- 
who be this pro bono publico i wonder

-PRON- donot mean to say that col keever write this letter -PRON- 
yes i do 
why -PRON- s simply furious and vow that hell have life 
by this time -PRON- be at the lisbon house and i -PRON- friend the enemy pettibone with one hand on the veranda railing throw back -PRON- head and laugh boisterously 
keever be play to the gallery say -PRON- the slick hand at makebelieve that i ever know and know a good many 
-PRON- hasnot any more thought of fight a duel than i have but hell act as bloodthirsty as a savage -PRON- see that if i go out to lake elizabeth and interfere by force to prevent the duel hell come out of the scrape in high feather 
the rank and file of this town have never drop a plum meet to the bottom of the nature but chris waffle have and so have that s sure go out there to stop -PRON- be -PRON- go out there but not to stop -PRON- an swered pettibone fold the letter which guy have hand back to -PRON- and replace -PRON- in -PRON- pocket go out there to hide in the brush and look on 
-PRON- word for -PRON- mr herbert -PRON- will stop -PRON- seethe north shore of lake eliza beth at oclock wednesday afternoon

i have too much at stake 
all right then 
i wonot be go more than half an hour 
thereupon the sheriff stride off down the street dilemma i i and guy go up on the veranda and seat -PRON- self 
at that hour pedro smith be in the kitchen oversee the preparation for dinner 
guy be alone in that quarter and -PRON- remove the pink envelope very gently from -PRON- pocket and open -PRON- and draw forth the perfumed sheet 
-PRON- be really from miss betty and -PRON- heart beat faster than usual as -PRON- read the dainty writing 
dear friend there be a matter of grave -PRON- be portance which i wish to discuss with -PRON- 
as i can not come to concord and -PRON- can not come to harmony may i ask -PRON- to meet -PRON- at some neutral point tomorrow wednesday afternoon at oclock 
there be a pretty little lake which be name after -PRON- and which lie equally distant be tween the two elizabeth 
please meet -PRON- there 
-PRON- very truly pinkney will accompany -PRON- but i shall expect -PRON- to come alone 
the joy which guy feel over this propose meet e with miss betty be lose in the consternation which suddenly seize upon -PRON- 
by what strange coincidence have -PRON- appoint for -PRON- meeting the very place day and hour fix upon by the duellist for -PRON- affair of honor 
and how be -PRON- to go alone when -PRON- have already agree to go with the sheriff 
anyhow how could -PRON- go alone any place 
guy be in despair 
-PRON- do not see how -PRON- could possibly engineer affair so as to prevent i -PRON- friend the enemy miss betty from get the idea that -PRON- be twoface and have betray to the sheriff the con tent of -PRON- letter 
here be a dilemma of gigantic proportion and how be -PRON- to get around -PRON- 
guy have an idea that -PRON- may telegraph miss vlandingham -PRON- would be at lake elizabeth at oclock but that through circumstance over which -PRON- have no control the sheriff would ac company -PRON- 
a little reflection convince -PRON- that -PRON- would not be well to send a message of this kind so instead of that -PRON- send the follow ing please appoint another day same place 
this be tantamount to say that -PRON- would not be able to meet miss betty at the rendezvous and guy highly pleased with the way -PRON- have get around the difficulty return from the telegraph office to the hotel 
unfortunately -PRON- do not observe that col keever be in the freight department of the depot where -PRON- have come to find out whether the patent outside for the next issue of the blizzard have yet arrive 
un see the colonel overheard the young man colloquy with the operator 
what the great man do after that will soon appear 
pettibone join guy at dinner 
after the meal -PRON- smoke -PRON- cigar and chat in friendly i -PRON- friend the enemy fashion until oclock when young alec drive a highstepper and a cover buggy up to the hotel veranda 
guy and the sheriff immediately get into the vehicle and drive off leave young alec stare wistfully after -PRON- 
very soon the traveller be out of town and roll rapidly along the level road which wear deeply into the turf be almost as hard and smooth as asphalt 
the sun have half descend the western sky a few vaporous cloud float overhead and a balmy wind blow from the north west and languidly ripple the grass and the flower 
the whistle of a robin and the plaintive note of a meadow lark thrill through the scene give a touch of melody to a day already per fect 
this be something like living remark guy again and again fill -PRON- lung to -PRON- full capacity with the warm sweet air what assent pettibone 
if a man be only out in these part for -PRON- health what a time -PRON- could have god make the country -PRON- say and man make the town lovely until civilized people come along tickle the soil with a plow and make -PRON- laugh wheat and oats and then the trouble begin 
seem like the more nature smile and show -PRON- good feeling the more unsociable people become 
now look there the sheriff wave -PRON- hand towards the stretch of prairie dot with square of grow grain each square push the shack of -PRON- owner as far an affair of honor i towards -PRON- limit as -PRON- ever see anything purti 
but there s a heart in every one of those shack mr herbert that s bitter as gall over this countyseat question 
and if -PRON- wasnot that -PRON- would be something else 
i tell -PRON- a human bein have get to have a grievance to nurse or fondle or tuck away or put up on a pole and howl about or -PRON- wonot be content right 
why be the farmer so deeply interested in the countyseat fight 
most of -PRON- have a lot or two in town so -PRON- a pocketbook affair with -PRON- 
those that havenot any lot just take side in order to have some thing to quarrel about 
the farmer that live nearest to concord be a concord man and the one close to harmony be for that town tooth and nail 
sile -PRON- house way over yender -PRON- can see -PRON- just over the lash of -PRON- whip nowwell when -PRON- first build -PRON- claim shanty -PRON- be right square between the two town not a foot farther from concord than -PRON- be from harmony 
for a long time sile didnot know what to do for a grievance and -PRON- worry -PRON- so that -PRON- hitch -PRON- team to -PRON- shack one night and pull -PRON- over onto the northeast corner of -PRON- hundred and sixty 
that bring -PRON- near concord see 
when the countyseat be locate in concord and thing get fairly quiet there -PRON- be blue as a whetstone till -PRON- haul -PRON- shack across to the southw corner of the quarter and i -PRON- friend the enemy that make a harmony man out of -PRON- 
just now -PRON- donot make any difference which side of -PRON- farm -PRON- s on 
sile can be in hot water all the time so -PRON- s just about as comfortable in the spirit as any man can be and live 
and that s the way -PRON- go 
dick pettibone be full of anecdote and reminis cence and sage reflection on life and the half hour which -PRON- require for the highstepper to trot -PRON- to -PRON- destination be while away most agreeably 
lake elizabeth be a small but beautiful ex panse of water shimmer like a diamond against the green of the plain 
on all side the bank have a gentle slope and there be wide reach of white sand skirt the water edge 
to the north be two small grove of cotton wood stand kneedeep in a dense undergrowth half an hour ahead of time say petti bone and consequently be first on the ground 
suppose -PRON- make -PRON- comfortable among those cottonwood where -PRON- canot be see and await development 
thus speak -PRON- head -PRON- horse toward the more southerly of the two grove 
in a little time the horse and buggy have be hide in the brushy tangle and the sheriff and guy have hit upon a point of vantage from which entirely un observe -PRON- could see the north shore of the lake in -PRON- full extent 
-PRON- have no more than settle -PRON- com an affair of honor fortably when a fall of hoof reach -PRON- ear and -PRON- see near the crest of the slope shore two horseman descend at a gallop toward the other grove 
by cracky mutter pettibone 
if there ainot old man glimmer and lem bilkin a feejee now what the dicken be -PRON- here for 
tell -PRON- that somebody and be oblige 
look at that go into hiding in the other grove 
well be dinge bilkin and glimmer disappear in the brush and among the tree to the north and all be outwardly as calm and serene as before 
the next arrival be col dingle and capt blue who drive a redwheele gig over the rise and down to a sentinel cottonwood that stand apart 
the captain and the colonel be joke and laugh and one would have imagine that a duel be as ordinary a matter with -PRON- as col keever have inform guy -PRON- have once be with -PRON- 
capt blue hitch the horse to a tree and as -PRON- finish and turn away col keever and samp son drive merrily upon the scene 
the editor of the blizzard be smoke a cigar and -PRON- extreme nonchalance be the most noticeable thing about -PRON- 
good afternoon gentleman -PRON- call courte ously to those already on the field 
col dingle and capt blue nod distantly and col keever shrug -PRON- fat shoulder i -PRON- friend the enemy chuckle cynically and get down from the buggy 
grope around under the seat -PRON- succeed in fiinde and in draw into sight a large revolver 
face about -PRON- press a spring pull down the barrel and give a businesslike glance at the cartridge in the cylinder 
this do -PRON- snap the revolver together knock the ashe from -PRON- cigar with the muzzle and swagger over in the direction of -PRON- opponent 
well say dingle sharply if -PRON- be ready pace off the distance and let -PRON- get this affair over with first flip a quarter for choice of posi tion return keever give a side glance at the sun 
the last time i figure in an affair of this kindwa -PRON- the last now or the next to the lastwell anyway i fight with the sun in -PRON- eye and only pink -PRON- man 
still -PRON- reminiscence be very interesting but i think -PRON- can dispense with -PRON- cut in capt blue take a quarter out of -PRON- pocket 
once for all col keever 
what be -PRON- 
the coin twirl in the air 
head cry keever and win the toss 
take up -PRON- position with -PRON- back to the west -PRON- motion to sampson 
the printer come at once leave the horse un hitch 
although the horse be know to be gentle -PRON- be a foolish thing for sampson to leave -PRON- in this way 
sampson pace off twenty step with capt an affair of honor i blue command keever 
if -PRON- would rather make -PRON- ten dingle agreeable 
five l cry the little colonel 
would -PRON- like to have -PRON- tie a handkerchief over one of -PRON- eye ask col keever with exasperate condescension dislike to take any advantage of -PRON- -PRON- be disturb flare dingle hotly 
when -PRON- come to pistol practice -PRON- one eye be as good as -PRON- two eye any day 
calm -PRON- dingle or -PRON- aim will be bad 
sampson see that i get five pacesor less 
five very short pace be stump off by the captain who punctuate the distance by drive -PRON- wooden leg into the sand at both posi tion 
all right colonel sing out sampson and the principal be soon back to back weapon in hand await the fall of capt cap which be to be the signal to turn and fire 
from -PRON- place of concealment in the brush guy and pettibone be listen to the conversa tion and watch the sanguinary preparation with intense interest 
be -PRON- to be a tragedy after all instead of a farce 
guy be begin to grow nervous better go out and stop this before -PRON- too late -PRON- say excitedly kill each other to pettibone -PRON- believe -PRON- return the sheriff con fidently 
hear that i this be where bilkin and -PRON- friend the enemy glimmer take a hand and warrant keever put -PRON- up to -PRON- 
bilkin and glimmer have suddenly leap from the other patch of timber and guy and the sheriff see -PRON- bind over the intervene space and hurl -PRON- upon col keever 
sampson have also seize -PRON- employer and the three be strug gle with -PRON- in great desperation 
capt blue take a pipe from one pocket a handful of tobacco from another and fill the pipebowl calmly and methodically while watch apparently desperate attempt to free -PRON- 
stand off shout dingle 
break away from that scoundrel or open fire on -PRON- all no attention be pay to -PRON- 
go for the whole lot dingle advise the captain apply a match to -PRON- pipe and puff out little cloud of white vapor 
crack l come a shot from the little revolver 
the bullet plump into the ground at the foot of the struggle quartet throw a spurt of sand into the air 
at this ominous sound the four concordian separate and begin to run 
the report also frighten the horse attach to the buggy and the animal take to a wild gallop and vanish over the swell in a twink ling 
crack crack crack volley the little revolver and faster and faster flee the an affair of honor concordian the gallant keever despite -PRON- avoirdupois keeping well in the lead 
dingle give chase and continue to follow until -PRON- weapon be empty and -PRON- foe out of sight then -PRON- return shake hand with capt blue and -PRON- unhitch -PRON- horse climb into the redwheele gig and drive unconcernedly away 
pettibone be roll on the ground kick -PRON- heel and choke with tumultuous mirth 
guy share the sheriff enjoyment with the same ap preciation if not the same abandon but the laughter die suddenly upon -PRON- lip 
-PRON- have chance to look out over the sandy shore of the lake and the vision that meet -PRON- gaze have hush -PRON- merriment 
after -PRON- have turn away to rub -PRON- eye -PRON- look again 
could -PRON- believe the evidence of -PRON- sense 
pettibone be not slow to observe the change that have come over -PRON- companion

as for guy -PRON- be stricken dumb in -PRON- track 
-PRON- could say nothing do stand where -PRON- be and watch the carriage disappear on one hand and the shouting and angry trio advance on the other 
what untimely fate have bring bilkin and glimmer to the sheriff rescue and make possible this awful finale 
guy be soon to know 
as -PRON- draw close to guy bilkin glimmer and pettibone separate surround -PRON- and press cautiously in from three point of the compass 
when within a dozen foot of the young man the sheriff throw up -PRON- right hand 
this be a pre arranged signal for the attack force to halt for a parley 
if -PRON- try to resist -PRON- herbert say petti bone menacingly be mighty sorry for -PRON- before -PRON- get through a good feller as i say but even a good feller be generally able to tell when -PRON- s get enough 
where do bilkin and glimmer come from inquired guy 
-PRON- circle around back to get -PRON- horse speak up glimmer 
-PRON- didnot know but those two harmony chap may still be here admit bilkin artlessly so -PRON- do -PRON- circlin toth side the swell and out of sight 
-PRON- i think i be a goner sure -PRON- leg be about ten foot too short and goodness know -PRON- be plenty long for most occasion 
the runnin yet 
i 4o -PRON- friend the enemy if i didnot know the colonel so well say glimmer should think -PRON- be a coward 
but a man who see so much slaughter in -PRON- late war couldnot be that 
i wasnot afraid glare through -PRON- ironrimmed glassesand i just run after the colonel to see if i couldnot persuade -PRON- to come back 
-PRON- shake -PRON- fist in the direction of harmony 
if i ever meet that blue alone but word prove powerless and -PRON- finish with an ominous frown and shake of the head 
oh yes commented pettibone sarcastically if -PRON- ever get at blue i suppose there wonot be anything leave but splinter 
will -PRON- surrender herbert or have -PRON- get to close in on -PRON- have a half notion to close in on -PRON- re turn guy irritably make a pretty mess of this those lady be positive now that i have the three of -PRON- lie in ambush donot care what -PRON- think answer the sheriff probably be lie over there yet if bilkin and glimmer hadnot pass near enough to hear -PRON- call to -PRON- have to be lock up after this 
try to lock -PRON- up and -PRON- may find -PRON- have catch a tartar retort guy 
because i have submit peaceably to -PRON- surveillance that be no sign i do not know -PRON- right break no law and if -PRON- try any highhanded measure make this county too hot to hold -PRON- fellow 
if the indictment i necessary have a company of soldier here to protect -PRON- 
the harmony invincible i suppose sneer pettibone 
no sir a company of regular from stand rock or fort totten

pettibone rub the back of -PRON- head as -PRON- say this and assume such an injured air that guy have to laugh in spite of -PRON- vexation 
lem bilkin once more glimmer unbent -PRON- so far as to smile and pettibone who always have a laugh lurk somewhere close to the surface be catch in the general hilar ity 
anyway qualify the sheriff there ainot go to be much fun in this for -PRON- herbert

well an idea that i can take care of -PRON- self say guy have tell -PRON- once or twice and i tell -PRON- again i havenot do anything treasonable and just as loyal to concord as col keever -PRON- 
glimmer and bilkin exchange sly glance titter suggestively 
guy kindle at this say nothing and go with pettibone to help back the horse and carriage out of the brush and but -PRON- by -PRON- friend the enemy the time -PRON- be start glimmer and bilkin be two gallop speck on the horizon pretty powerful in a setto observe pettibone drive with one hand and stroke the back of -PRON- head with the other

a pair of blue eye have bewitch more than one young feller and not go to lay up anything against -PRON-

miss vlandingham be far above any such double dealing as that 
the sheriff shake -PRON- head hopelessly exactly the way -PRON- strike in -PRON- mut tere have the same kind of a spell and get so ethereal i didnot want to eat or do a blessed thing but write poetry 
if matilda have tell -PRON- grasshopper be butterfly or that jimson pod be lily of the valley have fight with the the indictment man who call -PRON- by -PRON- right name 
that be before -PRON- get marry though now -PRON- different

gee whittaker do -PRON- ever hear anything to beat -PRON- -PRON- joke waffle ask guy whose credulity be sorely tax by the state ment 
this be altogether too serious a matter to joke about 
concord can spare keever just as well as not but -PRON- a big loss to have the record and the courthouse steal 
i guess well have to tally one for harmony this innings 
this explain what vlandingham say to pinchbeck say guy reflectively 
what be that 
why that fool build courthouse and wise man occupy -PRON- about what -PRON- amount to 
harmony have the laugh on -PRON- now and if -PRON- run this thing to earth bet -PRON- find daughter at the other end of -PRON- the only one in harmony who d be able to hatch up such a scheme 
guy remember how -PRON- have see miss betty in the courthouse a tape line in -PRON- hand jot down something in a notebook 
-PRON- flash over -PRON- at that moment that -PRON- have be take i i -PRON- friend the enemy measurement with the view of consummate this coup 
how be -PRON- do judge query guy 
easy enough 
the harmony folk manufac ture a pair of long axle and swing each one between a couple of low broadtire wheel 
there be a storm last night if -PRON- remember and that be exactly what the other side want 
the noise of the thunder and the wind and the rain drown out the commotion -PRON- make so that no one in this town hear themunless -PRON- be keever and -PRON- very soon take care of -PRON- guarantee 
after -PRON- have lift the court house with jackscrew -PRON- slide the wheel under -PRON- front and rear and then hitch several team of horse to -PRON- and haul -PRON- away 
-PRON- can see the track of the wheel where -PRON- sink into the wet ground 
pettibone and several more armed to the tooth have start along the south trail at a gallop 
but -PRON- will have -PRON- trouble for -PRON- pain mark -PRON- a notice that be leave stick on a post near the courthouse site and -PRON- what i call add insult to injury with a vengeance 
the judge take from -PRON- pocket very carefully a wet and bedraggle scrap of paper on which be write the following to the people of concord greeting -PRON- need a courthouse to go with the weathervane so -PRON- think -PRON- would take yours

-PRON- see i tell the indignation committee that if -PRON- keep -PRON- a prisoner -PRON- would have to bring -PRON- up for trial 
after the way i throw the law into lis comb -PRON- be afraid to have -PRON- try -PRON- case and so -PRON- say -PRON- would keep -PRON- a prisoner until after the election 
that isnot the law the way i read -PRON- and as pettibone be chase after the courthouse and as get a key to this room i think this would be a good time to let -PRON- scamper 
the people have get -PRON- head so full of other thing -PRON- wonot be able to think of -PRON- -PRON- friend the enemy for a while and advise -PRON- to go some place jimtown or bismarck or anywhere else -PRON- want toand stay for a few day until the suspicion and hard feeling against -PRON- have a chance to blow over do -PRON- say guy and shake hand gratefully

thank remember the name 
guy follow the judge from the room down the stair and out into the street 
the wild clangor of the bell have cease and the excited shouting the grind of carriage and wagon wheel and the fierce tattoo of hoof have give place to a church yard quiet 
there be many people on the street but -PRON- hat be pull moodily down over -PRON- brow and -PRON- converse with one another in hush tone 
the stunning effect of the calamity have set in 
go over to the lisbon house guy pass through the deserted office to the dining room

yesterday i be give -PRON- choice 16o -PRON- friend the enemy either of leave town or be lock up

so be seconded pinney 
the rest be of the same mind even the sheriff join in with -PRON- 
as pettibone voice -PRON- agreement with -PRON- com panion -PRON- flash guy a meaning glance and the quirt fly awkwardly from -PRON- hand 
dismount e the sheriff lead -PRON- horse aside and bent to pick up the whip

still guy do not halt and pettibone knock the liveryman arm downward before -PRON- could fire 
the first victim i none of that leffingwell cry the sheriff

thereupon the six of -PRON- have recourse to -PRON- spur and quirt 
the horse of the pursuer have see hard ser vice that morning and be at a disadvantage mount on the contrary be comparatively fresh and -PRON- could see by the hasty glance which -PRON- occasionally throw over -PRON- shoulder that -PRON- be slowly increase the distance that separate -PRON- from those behind 
there be a point where the road fork one branch lead on to amityville and the other turn sharply in the direction of harmony 
pursue and pursuer be draw close to this point attention be take up by those behind and pettibone and -PRON- companion have eye for no one but the young man in front 
thus -PRON- happen that a large contingent of mount man spur swiftly along the harmony road fail to capture the notice of those on the other trail 
realization be bring suddenly home to the concordian by a terrific yell from the har monyite 
pettibone and -PRON- friend draw rein panicstricken and whirl to flee

stop shoot -PRON- cry again and the quiv ere impotence of -PRON- voice amaze -PRON- 
stop shoot or -PRON- will kill somebody -PRON- have in tend to make the shout a lusty one but -PRON- be scarcely more than a whisper 
everything in -PRON- line of vision begin to reel 
the horseman in front become tangle in a maze 
-PRON- raise -PRON- in -PRON- stirrup press both hand over the burn spot in -PRON- side and then pitch head foremost from -PRON- saddle 
on the night col keever guard the county record -PRON- take with -PRON- into the courthouse a winchester rifle and a pint flask

during those seven day the young man neither see nor hear anything of miss betty

why say -PRON- get about twelve hundred lot in concord mr landy 
so tell respond the unruffled landy 
but the hull twelve hundred wonot be worth three harmony lot after the election donot think i can accept -PRON- offer even if i -PRON- friend the enemy that be a fair statement of the case 
just then guy have a bright thought 
there be thirty five voter in amityville landy -PRON- ask arenot there mr fifteen correct landy and i carry every vote in -PRON- pocket

yes or more 
why if i have a block of harmony lot be independent rich as soon as the countyseat que tion be settle and the boom set in 
-PRON- influence would be worth -PRON- -PRON- get a block

i only get six and be give two to transfer to every voter in amity ville 
mr landy of amityville -PRON- donot say so exclaimed guy 
be -PRON- possible that that be squire idea of fair treatment 
only six lot for gain the countyseat for harmony well well 
guy lean back in -PRON- chair and look at landy sympathetically 
vlandingham have pull the wool over -PRON- eye abe chuckle whittaker make due note of -PRON- cousin long face 
-PRON- doesnot look as though -PRON- have treat -PRON- just right do -PRON- now mumble landy

when vlan dingham get ready to have -PRON- petition to the county commissioner sign -PRON- hand -PRON- a due bill for six lot together with fourteen other due bill for two lot each for the rest of the voter in amityville 
all -PRON- do be to slap -PRON- on the back and call -PRON- abe and say how much -PRON- think of -PRON- 
gosh 
and to think that -PRON- be make game of -PRON- all the time 
-PRON- be too bad mr landy rejoin guy 
for some time -PRON- have be furtively take mr measure and -PRON- be now ready to lay on the finish stroke of a hastily evolve plan 
if amityville vote for concord -PRON- go on almost a certainty that concord will win 
when -PRON- be once settle that concord have the countyseat hard and fast the town will boom -PRON- friend the enemy i 9o and lot will sell like hot cake 
as i tell -PRON- i have over twelve hundred good lot and i wouldnot object to give thirtyfour due bill for two lot each to every man woman and child in amityville except abraham landy 
as for mr landy i would ask -PRON- to distribute the thirtyfour due bill and then if -PRON- would promise to return a solid vote for concord i would give -PRON- a thirtyfifth due bill for fifty lot two full block do that would -PRON- explode landy leap from -PRON- chair would answer guy and i would con sider that mr landy have do -PRON- a favor 
mr landy clasp -PRON- hand behind -PRON- and walk around the house -PRON- eye turn ground ward hook -PRON- mutter the delighted whittaker 
by jink -PRON- have hook -PRON- mr herbert 
and whittaker be right 
ten minute late guy be write due bill by the dozen and half an hour later mr landy be homeward bind after have give a write agreement to poll every amityville ballot for concord 
while -PRON- be engage in give away lot guy do not forget to present whittaker with half a dozen thereupon that gentleman solemnly covenant that -PRON- house should remain forever upon the concord side of -PRON- farm 
this deal consummate guy go in and lay mr landy of amityville i down 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- have do a good stroke of work for concord 
-PRON- conscience trouble -PRON- somewhat for there be a hint of sharp practice in -PRON- deal with landy that be directly oppose to the young man inclination and general character 
still if vlandingham have buy ami tyville signature to -PRON- petition why should not guy buy amityville vote 
the ballot of the two set of import voter each just a score in number would nullify each other 
now that ami tyville be to go for concord the success of concord seem certain 
the first flush of assure victory over guy be gan to feel sorry for miss betty 
-PRON- be bend every effort towards win a victory for har mony and be so confident of the result that hewell -PRON- almost regret that -PRON- have allow -PRON- self to purchase mr influence

after grin ne slyly -PRON- vanish as quickly as -PRON- have ap peare lady murmur guy in trepidation 
-PRON- have be so busy with -PRON- thought that -PRON- have hear no sound indicative of the arrival of a visitor 
as -PRON- arise -PRON- glance through a win dow and see miss pinkney seat in a gorgeous trap and hold a horse 
the next moment -PRON- see whittaker approach the trap stand beside -PRON- and engage miss pinkney in conversation 
the young man heart flutter 
at last 
at last i -PRON- friend the enemy -PRON- would be able to explain that affair on the lake shore 
miss betty be wait for -PRON- when -PRON- enter the other room 
-PRON- come forward hastily and take one of -PRON- hand in both -PRON- own 
the look on -PRON- face be one which -PRON- have never see there before

-PRON- raise the gloved hand to -PRON- lip 
again the scarlet fly to -PRON- cheek and -PRON- turn and flee from the house 
the election be to be hold on tuesday and the monday precede have be fraught with matter of grave concern for col keever 
the most mo mentous of these matter be the strike of samp son for back pay and high wage the most momentous because like the newly start snow ball the incident grow amazingly in importance until -PRON- end in the disgrace -PRON- ban ishment from the town and the wrecking of the blizzard 
to begin with the blizzard have never be much of a financial success 
-PRON- be a paper of johnsonian excellence that be to say so ponder ous in -PRON- utterance that -PRON- have to be read with a one elbow 
the little fish talk like whale on every line and through every column 
in a community necessarily defi cient in -PRON- supply of webster the blizzard be venerate and fear because of -PRON- evident learn e 
for the same reason but few subscribed for -PRON- and so small be the subscription list at the time the unfeele sampson go on strike and -PRON- friend the enemy so meagre be the advertising patronage that the colonel have barely two dollar that -PRON- could call -PRON- own 
in -PRON- extremity -PRON- bewail the reckless impulse which have lead -PRON- to pay hepburn the discharge section hand from harmony twenty dollar for information which have prove of no value 
the great man dream of that twentydollar bill in -PRON- sleep and would clutch at -PRON- so fiercely that -PRON- would awakeawake to realize that -PRON- be go forever 
-PRON- printing plant have cost -PRON- five hundred dollar and -PRON- have pay all but four hundred and fifty dollar of that debt 
-PRON- have no lot in concord and if guy have demand a settlement -PRON- would have be find that there be fifty or more which could not be account for 
that very monday pedro smith have press the col onel for a board bill long past due the news company have send -PRON- patent outside by ex press cover certain arrearagesand the bundle be still in the express office while the form wait in vain on the army press 
what be the colonel to do 
rack with all these worry -PRON- have enter -PRON- office only to be confront by sampson who demand money and declare -PRON- would stop work if -PRON- didnot get -PRON- 
this be the last straw 
the patience give way and hot word be pass between -PRON- and -PRON- printer 
and thenwell -PRON- strike samp four gentleman from harmony son with -PRON- cane and sampson hit -PRON- with a chair and throw -PRON- into one corner and shake a fist in -PRON- face and vow revenge rrrevenge 
after that sampson go away in high dudgeon and the colonel pick -PRON- up limp to -PRON- office chair and sit there for a long long time bitterly reflect 
the sun go down the shad ows of evening fall and still the acute mind have find no loophole for escape from -PRON- present difficulty 
-PRON- be at this juncture that four gentleman from harmony all of serious aspect and wear black slouch hat ascend the unsteady stair that lead to the office of the blizzard 
and one be very tall and one have a glass eye and the third stump through life on a wooden pin and the fourth carry an empty sleeve 
business call -PRON- to concord and illfortune have prepare the colonel to greet -PRON- in receptive mood 
the committee of way and way and questionable meanscame at night as befit doer of ignoble deed 
-PRON- twoseate carriage and team be leave at the edge of town and -PRON- be unseen by any save sampson 
-PRON- still car rie a key to the workroom and as -PRON- enter by the front -PRON- enter at the rear 
col keever cherish no illfeeling and wel come -PRON- caller cordially and humorously 
should -PRON- put -PRON- name down for a year sub scription to -PRON- invaluable paper twofifty a year in advance 
-PRON- friend the enemy no the four gentleman from harmony have not call for any such purpose 
indeed 
while -PRON- four caller be unfortunate in so far as -PRON- reside in a town with such a poor outlook as harmony yet lack of taste be not a crime and col keever be glad to extend the right hand of fellowship to col dingle maj 
harp capt blue and mr boomer 
col dingle maj 
harp capt blue and mr boomer gratefully acknowledge col amicable sentiment and beg to assure -PRON- of -PRON- own couple with a slight offering in the way of liquid refreshment 
this preliminary matter arrange to the voluble satisfaction of all party col dingle ask to know if -PRON- be alone 
col keever tell -PRON- that -PRON- could not be more utterly alone if -PRON- be set down on the broad bosom of the nothing to drink 
then -PRON- all laugh and clap the great man on the back and seem to think -PRON- an excel lend joke and col keever become bland and facetious and inform -PRON- again of -PRON- ever lasting regard 
follow this mr boomer go to the door and look out on the landing and down the stair and come back seemingly satisfied 
all clear colonel -PRON- say and col dingle hitch -PRON- chair into confidential proximity to col four gentleman from harmony colonel -PRON- observe carefully concord be the countyseat of goodwill county 
col keever reply that -PRON- have no reason to dispute -PRON- honorable friend statement

when -PRON- rain col dingle know where to go to keep out of the wet 
dingle laugh -PRON- natural eye glow and -PRON- nudge keever with -PRON- elbow 
the other three gentleman join in the merriment liquid refresh ment be again bountifully administer and the good feeling prevail to an extent that be al most morbid 
dingle hang languishingly on shoulder while the three other huddle about anxious to laugh at any joke however old and silently -PRON- be plore an opportunity to express -PRON- unbounded affection for everybody special election have be call for the pur pose of shift the countyseat from concord to harmony dingle resume and a twothird vote be necessary to the consummation of such a change 
now -PRON- be impossible to deny that har mony be a favorite with twothird of the county -PRON- friend the enemy but designate -PRON- and -PRON- three understand how ut terly vain -PRON- would be for harmony to attempt to secure the countyseat without the good will and assistance of one whose ability be undoubted whose virtue be the envy of -PRON- fellow man and whose congenial nature be a theme of general re mark 
in short col archibald keever of con cord 
col keever smile -PRON- gratification and desire to state that -PRON- have never be -PRON- extreme good fortune to run across so truthful a man as col dingle nor such a wholesoule appreciative set of companion as have accompany -PRON- and -PRON- hope that know -PRON- as -PRON- all do -PRON- would take this little apostrophe for what -PRON- be worth 
in the meantime as the national debt be oppressive why not give -PRON- another lift 
the four gentleman from harmony readily un derstood this hint and four flask be stretch out simultaneously towards col keever 
the latter bow and to the end that none may feel aggrieve pay due and lengthen attention to each flask supplement each draught with a peculiarly happy remark relative to the generosity of the donor and the excellence of -PRON- gift 
this small formality over col dingle once more resume -PRON- topic in a voice that be grow husky by very apparent degree 
col keever -PRON- have manage the townsite of concord and manage -PRON- well 
among other four gentleman from harmony thing -PRON- have go ahead like an able tactician and have rush into this precinct certain man to build bridge and house and repair road and heaven know what 
now everybody be aware that the road be all right the bridge in good condition and that -PRON- have more house than -PRON- can use 
well then why have -PRON- bring all these man here 
oh -PRON- know that fertile brain that intellect that labor and bring forth the blizzard have hide -PRON- purpose well but -PRON- have discover -PRON- -PRON- boy 
-PRON- have come a chorus of thick voice 
col keever wear a perpetual smile very child like very bland and -PRON- would wink -PRON- right eye now and then and shake -PRON- head with a great deal of feel the purpose -PRON- inquire evince a tendency to run -PRON- word together this 
that special election be call for to morrow 
these man will have be in the county sixty day and in the precinct twenty day con sequently -PRON- can vote and naturally -PRON- will vote for concord wonder much remark keever with a dry hiccough 
twenty man and i pay -PRON- two dollar a day for sixty twentyfour hundred dollar that -PRON- cost -PRON- to save the countyseat 
and who s to the fore in the enterprise 
col archibald keever i declare gentlemen -PRON- throat be parch 
would -PRON- be ask too much -PRON- friend the enemy -PRON- be not ask too much 
col keever be welcome to the good -PRON- have in the shop and all there be of -PRON- 
and this bring -PRON- back to where -PRON- start say col dingle 
harmony would like the county seat and -PRON- would like -PRON- just two thou sand dollar worth 
dingle give keever a playful push that murmur keever roll -PRON- eye 
just this go on dingle 
instead of vot e these man for concord vote -PRON- for har mony 
-PRON- can do -PRON- 
the great mind that build up a paper like the blizzard can do anything 
col keever relapse into silence and do -PRON- good to think calmly while the four gentleman from harmony await -PRON- reply in soulful expecta tion 
two thousand ask keever huskily 
two thousand come an equally husky reply 
cash down 
fifty now and nineteen hundred and fifty when the vote be poll 
a long period of silence ensue to be finally break by keever with the anxious query gen1 man be there any left

and put this in -PRON- pocket too -PRON- add take from the desk the paper that have just be sign tramp printer isnot the man to be fool with colonel and -PRON- will understand this before i be do with -PRON- 
with that sampson shake -PRON- fist at the col onel and strode from the office

a sentimental journey -PRON- be every step of the way from to the a delicious fare across the sunny plain through a drowsy odor of wild flower and under such sky as smile over the fortunate isle 
touch by the spell neither of the young people waste much time in conversation and the long lapse of silence into which -PRON- fall be rhythmic interval wherein -PRON- heart echo back the melody of a song as old as the day of man 
arrive at -PRON- destination guy heave a sigh of regret 
the calend of -PRON- love have lift a white stone to mark a pass hour and -PRON- be more securely a captive if that could be 
the young man sojourn at willowview be very brief 
both miss betty and -PRON- father ex erte -PRON- to the utmost to make -PRON- stay enjoyable but -PRON- be ill at ease 
-PRON- negotiation with mr landy have certainly win the county seat for concord and -PRON- seem to -PRON- as though -PRON- be act a double part 
when the return come in and when the genial squire and the adorable miss betty discover how wily and tactful -PRON- have be -PRON- fear that there would be an upheaval and that -PRON- would deny -PRON- -PRON- hospitality and send -PRON- forth in scorn 
-PRON- be all very well for miss betty to talk of the rigor of the game 
the prime incentive in every game be success and when the ballot be count and -PRON- be find that amityville have cast the rigor of the game a decide vote for concord -PRON- would see then whether miss betty would take defeat as glor iously as -PRON- would have take a well fortune 
-PRON- would be a bitter triumph for -PRON- if -PRON- cost -PRON- -PRON- favor 
yet if -PRON- have not speak those word in a spirit of railleryin short if -PRON- really mean themhow incomparable -PRON- would become in -PRON- eye 
as pettibone have say -PRON- could go to -PRON- and offer -PRON- a dower interest in -PRON- town then if -PRON- would accept 
and -PRON- heart leap at the thought and -PRON- mind wing skyward in sweeping dream

if -PRON- shrewdness and courage have please -PRON- in the political field how much more be -PRON- attract by -PRON- domestic accomplish ment 
guy be watch miss white finger flit over the key and now and then exchange a soft word in which -PRON- passion throb danger -PRON- friend the enemy ously near the surface when there come a sudden interruption

for -PRON- part i hope that illfate courthouse will be burn to the last stick enough 
-PRON- have cause trouble together -PRON- sit on the porch watch the the rigor of the game yellow flame leap high and toss -PRON- sparkle starlike cinder 
then gradually the fiery tongue sink down and down the glare fade out of the sky and -PRON- know that the courthouse have cease to be a factor in the contest 
the squire return by and by and with -PRON- walk a youth who be wheel a bicycle 
let -PRON- go in for a moment -PRON- hear the squire say gate

the clothe be tear one end of -PRON- collar be flap dismally about -PRON- neck and -PRON- have lose a shoe but never once do -PRON- forget -PRON- and release -PRON- hold on -PRON- cane 
some two mile out of town the angry citizen drop -PRON- victim roughly and give -PRON- warn e in term more forcible than polite never more to show -PRON- face within the corporate limit of concord 
sampson be the last of the indignant people to make -PRON- way back to town 
as -PRON- be about to pass from sight -PRON- turn for one final glimpse of -PRON- former employer 
and there the colonel sit -PRON- the great man who have raise out of nothing that monument of tireless energy and intellectual grandeur the concord blizzard 
the monument be gonehad pass away in a breathand there -PRON- sit soli tary and alone ponder the depth of -PRON- fall

hit -PRON- with -PRON- cane will then -PRON- shake -PRON- clench -PRON- hat -PRON- shout shrilly -PRON- fist whirl about and continue on towards concord 
-PRON- have carry -PRON- vengeance to a point which would have satisfy an ordinary mortal but there the voice of the people i be nothing ordinary about sampson 
-PRON- ire have mount high not only against the colonel but against everything that have form a part and parcel of the equipment 
the newspaper have gasp -PRON- last under the stran gle finger of the mob so that nothing remain save the building that have house the plant and even that be hateful to the printer 
while plod homeward -PRON- thought be more than busy and -PRON- evolve an idea that cause -PRON- to slap -PRON- skinny hand together and laugh impishly be the last act -PRON- mutter and the townll have something that will help to keep -PRON- memory green do ityes sir do -PRON- if -PRON- take a leg in pursuance of -PRON- plan sampson reentere the town by stealth 
screen by the watertank -PRON- cautiously reconnoiter the situation and dis cover that the weary and perspire citizen be gather about the door of the hotel 
nothing could have be more favorable and sampson give vent to an unholy chuckle 
mebby -PRON- wonot be surprised -PRON- whisper to -PRON- oh mebby -PRON- wonot 
warily -PRON- cross the railroad track crawl on hand and knee the full length of several pile of railroad tie and then by skilful manoeuvering gain the rear of the hotel unseen 
from this point the course be clear and -PRON- do not halt until -PRON- reach the cannon 
-PRON- friend the enemy except sampson there be not a soul any where in the vicinity of the twelvepounder 
mrs glimmer now that the colonel have be remove from the town have retire into the emporium with -PRON- knitting and -PRON- husband be still lin gere among those who hover about the hotel 
herkimer be on duty in the livery barn but the trouble of the town be nothing to -PRON- and -PRON- be clean harness in the harness room nefarious work may have be wit nesse by any one who chance to stand in front of the emporium or the livery barn and hence -PRON- will be see how fortune continue to favor -PRON- salute the blizzard mutter sampson with a laugh of the demoniacal kind give the blizzard a boom then -PRON- tug and push with tremendous energy until -PRON- have bring the muzzle of the cannon in line with the blizzard building 
when this be accomplish -PRON- fish a match out of -PRON- pocket and strike -PRON- against the side of the gun 
from the fact that this particular piece of ar tillery have be purchase of a junk dealer -PRON- have never have the full and unqualified confidence of those who be designate to fire -PRON- off 
as a precaution therefore -PRON- be usually discharge by mean of a two minute grace be utilize by the man who light the fuse in place -PRON- at a safe distance 
this precautionary measure be well known to samp the voice of the people son and after -PRON- have apply the match -PRON- take to -PRON- heel 
-PRON- do not get too far away how ever for -PRON- want to witness the devastation 
while -PRON- stand watch and wait -PRON- sud denly remember that some dynamite leave over from the operation of the import roadbuilder be store in the first story of the structure on which -PRON- have train the cannon and besides the dynamite there be also an assortment of fire work buy with a fund raise by popular subscription to be use in celebrate the come fourth of july 
great scott murmur sampson huskily 
by a wild impulse -PRON- start towards the can non then -PRON- turn abruptly give a despairing groan and make in the opposite direction pallid fearful and bent only on get away from the scene of -PRON- rash deed before the direful conse quence could overtake -PRON- 
a pettibone have remain discreetly in the back ground during the spilling of those vial of wrath 
guy have also keep clear of the mob but -PRON- reason for do so be different from petti bone 
if an investigation have follow that morning work -PRON- may reasonably have be ask why if the sheriff be present -PRON- have not perform -PRON- swear duty and prevent a destruction of prop erty and the subsequent violence which have be visit upon a citizen of the town culpable though -PRON- undoubtedly be 
pettibone forestall the question by take -PRON- out of the way 
as for guy -PRON- have suffer by the misdoing far more than any one else in concord and may have be excuse the desire to see punishment fall where -PRON- be so justly deserve 
but the desire be lack 
-PRON- do not care to glory in the downfall much less to wit ness -PRON- 
so after the citizen have disappear with the hate offender -PRON- seat -PRON- on the hotel veranda and be presently join by the sheriff 
-PRON- friend the enemy the activity of -PRON- friend the colonel will now be transfer to other quarter observe pettibone bring a chair from the office and drop into -PRON- with a deep breath of satisfac tion 
heaven help the other quarter -PRON- add soulfully 
herbert if -PRON- hadnot be for that redheade printer i hate to think what may have happen to -PRON- 
truth crush to earth will rise again smile the young man 
and the way of the transgressor be mighty harda the colonel have probably discover by this time 
pettibone take an old pipe from one pocket a handful of tobacco from another and be soon shroud in a cloud of smoke 
lone some will use to be load to the waterline with all these here proverb old sayin wise saw and so on 
have one for most every occasion 
ever hear about lonesome will herbert 
-PRON- be a harmony man and -PRON- s dead now live in harmony but be on that side of the county -PRON- understand

twenty of the remain twentyfour be as a matter of course cast by those hood lum from jimtown but who be the other four that vote here and vote for harmony 
guy shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- have -PRON- in mind to name sampson as one of the four but refrained 
some of the farmer who come in here to ex ercise the right of franchise must have be buy up by the other side proceed pettibone 
amityville go solid for -PRON- be the big kind of a surprise and when -PRON- explain how -PRON- happen over there by cannon -PRON- make -PRON- first tally not particularly proud of that say the young man suppose though that the only way to fight the devil be with fire all in -PRON- point of view chuckle the sheriff 
politics be a muddy country and -PRON- canot go through -PRON- and keep -PRON- shoe clean 
but to come back to the election -PRON- be the great big vote roll up by harmony that settle the case people present -PRON- -PRON- friend the enemy with eightyone ballot think of that 
several vote could be throw out and harmony would still have more than a twothird majority do up brown herbert that s sure accept the defeat as gracefully as -PRON- can return guy 
what will -PRON- do petti bone 
move over to harmony 
no harmony for -PRON- 
after a little go to resign 
-PRON- see get a nice eighty join the corner of this townsite and i be think if concord win that block -PRON- off into lot and call -PRON- addition 
now that wake up and find that be a dream i guess farm -PRON- 
-PRON- be silent for a minute puffing re flectively at -PRON- pipe one thing that s worry -PRON- herbert -PRON- add finally 
what be that not much on religion although get a streak of veneration in -PRON- all the same and tell -PRON- that when people sow the wind -PRON- be go to reap the whirlwind gospel ainot -PRON- believe so but how do -PRON- apply to this countyseat affair 
well now there s the colonel 
pettibone re move -PRON- pipe from -PRON- mouth and wave -PRON- in the direction of the return mob whose van guard be come into sight along the railroad track to the west 
-PRON- know what -PRON- sow and -PRON- know what -PRON- reapedpurty near 
-PRON- 
a fortunate disaster yes 
to go still further then do -PRON- think that run in a lot of rowdy from jimtown and bismarck as concord and harmony have do be anything more or less than sow trouble 
i donot and if -PRON- donot reap a cyclone miss -PRON- guess make a mistake herbert and think a calamity howler cause i ainot god know 
but in dead earnest with -PRON- now and i say -PRON- havenot reach the end have -PRON- dance and -PRON- have get to pay the fiddler 
those jimtown hoodlum get out of town purty fast tuesday night but positive -PRON- have an understanding with keever and just as positive that what ever keever have agree to do by -PRON- -PRON- wonot do 
work a real injury to a mana man that hasnot any scruple to speak ofand -PRON- make out of -PRON- an engyne of destruction 
ketch -PRON- mean e the next thing to say that possibly the position of sheriff in this county of goodwill wonot be quite so much of a sinecure during the next few day as -PRON- have be up to now why delayin -PRON- resignation mind be debate moman tous word when pinney leffingwell and pedro smith come wearily up to the veranda and throw -PRON- down on the step 
the rest of the party straggle along after -PRON- by two and three drop on the ground the moment -PRON- reach the shady side of the hotel building 
-PRON- be all dusty tired and perspiring but a calm 25o -PRON- friend the enemy sense of duty well do bring a glow of satis faction to every face 
nothing be say for some time then mr glim mer seat on the edge of the veranda fan -PRON- with -PRON- hat lift -PRON- voice sic semper tyrannis say -PRON- glare about -PRON- through -PRON- spectacle 
in those quarter where -PRON- be understand the remark be duly approve 
gentleman remark pinney rise to -PRON- foot the people have speak in no uncertain tone 
the torrent popular wrath anderrighteous indignation have overflow -PRON- bank and engulf the common enemy 
-PRON- cease 
there be general surprise for no one have imagine that the druggist could plume -PRON- speech with such rhetoric 
embolden by a ripple of applause the speaker continue like lightning from a clear sky the depth of this man perfidy be suddenly make known to -PRON- 
-PRON- do not pause -PRON- do not hesi tate 
-PRON- leap forward as one man and then artillery boom out zigzag flash bespangle the firmament the earth trem bleed open and keever from the sight of man 
the voice of the people have be hear the hand of the people have be feel l this magnificent period be receive by the gathering in silent awe thunder have defy nature by precede the lightning but that a fortunate disaster i be a minor point 
as -PRON- stand before -PRON- erect and glow with -PRON- impromptu effort -PRON- seem to the citizen as though the mantle of the editor have fall upon the shoulder of the drug gist 
as if to emphasize and illustrate the figurative term of the orator a hoarse from the low end of the main street tag closely upon the heel of -PRON- peroration 
-PRON- be the cannon pinney and the other recognize the sound but have barely time to exchange apprehensive glance when a terrific detonation shake the earth set every building in town aquiver crash into fragment all the glass in all the window and hurl glimmer from the veranda and levelled pinney in -PRON- track 
a lurid glare ghastly in the white light of day hover sullenly over concord 
swiftly -PRON- fade dbris begin to rain down and rocket and roman candle open a furious bombardment with -PRON- flaming ball 
strange serpentine thing leave fiery trail in the street and open space or wriggle in glow line over the rooftop or streak luminously through the air explode as -PRON- vanish pinwheel sputter above and below and flash into nothing with a shower of spark firecracker pop merrily here there and everywhere a bass note be frequently sound by one of the cannon variety and in front of the hotel a wonderful contrivance come plump down and forthwith unbosom -PRON- of -PRON- friend the enemy a veritable whirlwind of blaze vagary close with a beacon that change from red to white and then to blue 
then there ensue a lull in the wild confusion of fire and noise and glimmer raise -PRON- from the ground point across the street towards the roof of the townsite com panys build 
look -PRON- cry huskily 
the eye of the bewilder people follow the point finger and behold a setpiece whose in tricate wire have become entangle with the cop ing of the roof 
thus hold the device be sputter ing and hissing and trace in bloodre letter the ironical word what have happen 
eye seek eye and put the silent question 
the citizen begin to move mechanically as though awaken from some horrible nightmare 
woman and small child could be see rush from -PRON- dwelling and could be hear scream and lament 
a runa way team with a lumber wagon bounding behind plunge across the railroad track and disappear beyond the depot 
stray cow gallop from point to point with frenzied bellow and dog crouch shiver and whine in any chance corner that may afford protection 
the blizzard building cry pettibone dash e one hand across -PRON- eye 
there be dyna mite there and the firework for the fourth blow up -PRON- spring from the veranda and start south at a run the people follow 
a fortunate disaster never mind the blizzard building shout guy keenly alive to the danger of the moment 
fire may result from all this go to -PRON- home and store quiet -PRON- family and guard against fire this warning strike home and the frightened crowd disintegrate in every direction 
guy as soon as -PRON- make sure -PRON- advice would be act upon hurry down the street in the direction take by pettibone 
as -PRON- run -PRON- notice the broken window on either side and observe that the litter of splintered board increase as -PRON- ad vance 
at last -PRON- reach the spot where the blizzard building have stand only to find that -PRON- have disappear a deep hole in the earth mark -PRON- site 
more dbris be bank up about the brink of the hole and on the high part of the heap stand the sheriff this the bad -PRON- ever hear herbert 
pettibone call to guy argue against hav e that dynamite store here but keever have -PRON- say as usual under -PRON- not -PRON- -PRON- say and that settle -PRON- 
looket that cannon -PRON- add wave -PRON- hand towards the gun around whose muzzle a broken windowframe be hang e some un point -PRON- this way and touch -PRON- off 
who be -PRON- what like to know 
if there have be as much of that dyna mite in the storeroom as there be a month ago tell -PRON- concord would have be wipe off the map 
-PRON- friend the enemy guy climb up beside pettibone and survey the ruin from that position 
the building flimsily construct at best have be literally riven asun der the wall blow to fragment and crush back and the roof scatter piecemeal over the whole townsite 
for fully ten foot downward the earth have be displace heave up at the side and hurl over the broken board and timber 
the sheriff talk under -PRON- breath and shake -PRON- head gloomily move off towards the cannon and guy lower -PRON- carefully down the ragged side of the pit 
-PRON- see something that startle -PRON- 
-PRON- be an object irregular in shape and little large than a man fist 
pick up the fragment with tremble hand -PRON- pinch -PRON- in -PRON- finger examine -PRON- on every side and then drop -PRON- into -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- be pale with excitement and look up ward in the hope of see some one to whom -PRON- could announce -PRON- find 
but the sheriff have not return and there be no one else to hear -PRON- news 
suddenly a doubt sweep through -PRON- brain 
that fragment may have be in the storeroom at the time of the explosion press one hand to -PRON- forehead and stand for a second immovable the next moment -PRON- have hurry stumblingly to the deep part of the pit have sink to -PRON- knee and have begin scrape away the earth with -PRON- hand 
no no -PRON- whisper where -PRON- come from right here -PRON- get up and stamp with a fortunate disaster -PRON- heel in half a dozen different place 
there be no doubt -PRON- say to -PRON- no doubt in the world 
climb out of the pit -PRON- drop down on the heap of ruin and bow -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
what ail -PRON- herbert 
-PRON- be pettibone 
-PRON- have approach unno tice and be stand at the young man elbow 
what ail -PRON- 
guy repeat laugh jerkily 
oh nothing nothing 
be -PRON- -PRON- pettibone 
-PRON- reach out and catch the sheriff arm raise -PRON- slowly 
-PRON- face be still pale but -PRON- eye be bright and grow bright 
what make -PRON- think that there be anything the mat ter with -PRON- -PRON- ask 
great scott exclaim the sheriff only have to look at -PRON- to see that there s something up 
-PRON- own eighty acre adjoin this townsite do -PRON- pettibone

then keep -PRON- donot sell -PRON- no matter what -PRON- be offer 
tell every one else who own land around this town to hold on to what -PRON- have get possible pettibone guy bring -PRON- lip close to ear that -PRON- eighty will make -PRON- rich 
pettibone recoil a step and look at the young man sharply 
be -PRON- crazy or what -PRON- demand 
guy laugh again this time more naturally 
-PRON- friend the enemy not a prophet exactly say -PRON- but un less very much mistaken the blowing up of this building will prove the make cf concord 
let harmony have the countyseat if be not deceive concord have get something a hundred time more valuable look at -PRON- that way pettibone not rave and -PRON- mind be just as clear as -PRON- be this minute 
the man whoever -PRON- be who pour a broadside from cannon into the blizzard building be entitle to a vote of thank by every one in this community 
guy turn and walk away and pettibone look after -PRON- thunderstruck 
merciful power mutter the sheriff 
can -PRON- be that the loss of the countyseat and a slump in the value of twelve hundred lot more or less have turn brain 
i never see -PRON- like that before -PRON- ainot naturalno sir not with -PRON- 
two hour later an eastbound freight train back along the concord siding pick up a box car and steam away with -PRON- in the direction of jamestown 
this box car would technically have be call an empty 
but -PRON- be not empty in the strict meaning of the word for sampson be inside far go with terror because of the havoc -PRON- have work and scarcely dare to breathe until concord have be leave safely behind -PRON- 
no fire no fatality no one even seriously injure this be the remarkable record of the morning of that redlett day when col keever be banish the town and when sampson fire into the blizzard building and blow -PRON- to the four wind 
there be a property loss to be sure for apart from the destruction of the print estab lishment and the roof that have shelter itthe colonel own a small equity in eachnot a whole pane of glass have be leave in any building in concord 
whether the town be worth the expense and trouble of reglaze -PRON- window be a query propound by mr biggs the register of deed 
this matter be discuss in a spirit of levity and sarcasm not seriously 
and when -PRON- be find that mr biggs have speak in sober earnest and be to leave for harmony on the sixthirty freight the levity and sarcasm give place to scorn and derision 
mr biggs carry a carpetbag and bandbox fill with -PRON- worldly good be accompany to the train by a procession of citizen 
pedro -PRON- friend the enemy smith have a fife and bill comfort a drum and there be hastily devise brownpaper sign bear aloft some of -PRON- read -PRON- gain be har monys loss drum out of town the only one to go and what be -PRON- good for anyhow 
-PRON- be needless to say that this honor be en tirely unsolicite by mr biggs or that -PRON- fail to shake hand with the delegation before climb the step of the waycar and dodge inside to escape the missile that be hurl at -PRON- 
later that evening guy have a very serious dis cussion with pettibone in one corner of the hotel office 
in the course of an hour the young man succeed not only in convince the sheriff of -PRON- sanity but of several other important matter which vitally concern the future of concord 
herbert say pettibone shake hand with guy when ready to go a brick one chance in ten that -PRON- be wrong or that the business wonot pan out but the other nine chance be good enough for -PRON- 
keep -PRON- quiet for a while
