that the secret of the paper be out be due rather to tory guile and vigilance rather than to any lack of cautiousness on the part of the patriot 
while not expect to encounter difficulty capt paul be on the alert for -PRON- but -PRON- would have look upon -PRON- as a heartless wretch have -PRON- pass a woman who need aid and fail to give -PRON-

there be a terrific struggle back and forth across the cabin each man seek to draw a weapon and bring the battle to an end the other prevent -PRON- 
at last with an effort that call forth all -PRON- great strength capt paul tear away and strike rotherick from -PRON- 
the sailor stagger backward strike the lanthom with -PRON- foot and topple -PRON- through the trap 
from that moment -PRON- be a drawn battle 
neither combatant thought of anything but get clear of the roost in the short possible time 
as -PRON- bound past the man kneel on the floor the young planter linger an instant to sever the cord that bind -PRON- foot then race on 
-PRON- gain the after deck catch a glimpse of rotherick and the robber behind -PRON- and bluish flash puff upward from the hold and a thunderous explosion follow 
the young planter daze and bewilder find -PRON- a few minute after the explosion stand on the creek bank lean against a tree 
-PRON- left arm numb and bleeding hang limply at -PRON- side 
a dozen yard away the wreck of the roost be burn fiercely float fragment of the illstarre craft litter the water for a hundred foot up and down the small stream 
rotherick be nowhere in sight nor be the robber 
capt paul be presently aware that some one be talk to -PRON- and that the muzzle of a gun be stare -PRON- in the face ye try ter fight cause i get the dead wood on ye 
now tell -PRON- what s become o capt paul jone 
be -PRON- in that alec be behind the rifle and in -PRON- face be a strange mingling of grief and determination 
the young planter in -PRON- borrow garb be not recognize by the boy albeit the planter hat be go and but for the excitement of the moment wit would have prove equal to the emergency 
capt paul alec answer jone weakly 
the man rotherick come aboard the flatboat and -PRON- have a struggle 
a lighted lanthom be knock into the hold on a lot of powder and the magazine blow up 
capt paul cry alec 
yer own mother wouldnot have know ye in that getup hurt 
look at yer all bloody 
yes say the young planter have a close call of -PRON- and not -PRON- yet by a long chalk 
get the horse alec dizzy and can hardly stand 
as -PRON- speak capt paul sink down at the base of the tree everything in -PRON- range of vision whirl about -PRON- 
for some time after that -PRON- have only a confused notion of what happen 
-PRON- be not unconscious as -PRON- have be in -PRON- own house the evening before but -PRON- be on the verge of -PRON- 
the rough treatment rotherick have give -PRON- at the plantation may have have something to do with -PRON- hazy condition in the main however the explosion be to be jeld responsible 
how -PRON- have gain the shore when the deck of the flatboat heave upward beneath -PRON- capt paul have not 
-PRON- slight idea 
-PRON- remember vaguely that alec come with the brse and lift -PRON- to -PRON- saddle then that -PRON- ihreade the wood 
next dame gilpin and -PRON- husband be help -PRON- 
rom the horse and after that -PRON- be in a chair dame gilpin attend to -PRON- arm and master gilpin hold a jewter mug of madeira to -PRON- lip 
presently -PRON- walk to a couch assist by the ferryman and sink into a heavy slumber 
-PRON- sleep out the remainder of that day and the whole ff the succeed night apparently in as deep a trance as be duncan macbean but -PRON- be a natural sleep the deep of a man who have endure much and be far spend with weariness 
-PRON- dream have to do with the ebony box intrust to -PRON- by the virginia patriot 
when -PRON- awake the morning sun be look in at the open door and terence omalley and master gilpin be stand at the head of the couch 
ah ha cry omalley the lad -PRON- again 
faith -PRON- a wonder -PRON- s alive at all at all 
yez may well say that same masther omalley -PRON- an echoing brogue from the kitchen 
-PRON- be dame gilpin who like the dash terence be a gift of the ould sod to the new world 
many a man would have be dead long since av -PRON- have go through all that 
capt paul have do 
sure -PRON- a lad av iron -PRON- be 
how do ye feel captain ask gilpin as the young planter sit up on the couch 
hearty thank -PRON- smile the young planter must have sleep well i take -PRON- 
the whole night long sir say gilpin 
capt paul whistle incredulously 
where do -PRON- come from omalley -PRON- inquire afield with some of the other planter tryin to jet a crack at old truepenny tyburn north of the river and i ride over here for a word with master gilpin 
-PRON- think -PRON- couldnot trust -PRON- to scatter this iband of robber 
not so -PRON- lad cry omalley trust ye scatter anything from a corporal guard o red coat to a company o the own do -PRON- work paul the mangy breed be scatter by that night work at -PRON- plantation an the blowin up of the roost 
the leader be tryin to get clear an be hot after -PRON- 
-PRON- hear about the explosion then 
everyone have hear of -PRON- up an down the river 
as near as -PRON- can make out three o the band lose -PRON- life in the fight at -PRON- plantation an two more be find near the char wreck o the flatboat 
that make foive an old truepenny be not strong enough in number to stand the loss of so many 
the plantation paul owin to -PRON- gallant work be well rid o the band those that be leave be makin for distant part to leave ye now happy in the thought that yere -PRON- again 
hold hard a minute terence cry paul 
when do -PRON- halt at -PRON- place last 
in the early hour of the mornin 
have anyone call there inquire for -PRON- 
not a soul -PRON- boy 
capt paul be think of the man who be to call with the letter from mr adam and the key to the ebony box 
the messenger have not yet arrive and there be still time for -PRON- to make another attempt at recover the paper 
how be duncan macbean 
terence omalley shake -PRON- head a strange case for ye 
bob tichenor be there and -PRON- say condition be the quar thing -PRON- would ever encounter 
-PRON- lie quiet enough breathin natural and seeminly asleep 
sure -PRON- must have be a powerful drug 
but tichenor think hell come around all right an ye give -PRON- time 
omalley thereupon take -PRON- departure and capt paul get up and strip -PRON- of the borrow gear which -PRON- have don on the flatboat 
although -PRON- arm pain -PRON- the numbness be go and on the whole -PRON- feel well 
a brief examination show -PRON- that -PRON- be not to be cripple nor to be long without the use of the hand 
furthermore -PRON- discover that -PRON- have lose neither -PRON- sword nor -PRON- pistol 
if -PRON- have not carry -PRON- ashore after the explosion alec must have find -PRON- and take -PRON- in charge 
anyhow the weapon lie by the captain bunk in as good trim as ever -PRON- be 
a refreshing dip in cold spring water serve still further in give back to the young planter all -PRON- customary strength and vigor and when -PRON- have join the gilpin in a hearty breakfast -PRON- be prime for the road and eager to be about -PRON- work 
-PRON- have in mind a call at the house of samuel sparrow 
master plantation lie on both side of the river and -PRON- be rather two plantation than one each have -PRON- house and quarter but the master -PRON- live on the south shore 
if rotherick be to be believe the cronin have cross over to the north side thereby put a broad sweep of water between -PRON- and capt paul 
whether -PRON- be beyond the rappahannock still or have leave for other part since the night -PRON- have flee from capt plantation be the point the youth wish to settle by a call at master since mansion lie on -PRON- road to -PRON- own plantation capt paul would not be at much inconvenience in call there 
when the morning meal be do the young planter lose no time in take to the road 
-PRON- follow the highroad and not the bridle path 
have -PRON- desire -PRON- could have travel the latter course and thus have gain a final look at the relic of the robber roost which -PRON- have so successfully invade 
however -PRON- have no wish to return to the spot which have witness the explosion that have cost two of the robber -PRON- life and come so near to cost -PRON- -PRON- own 
there be a languid warmth even in that early hour and as -PRON- gallop through the heart of the thick wood redbird catbird and robin sing around -PRON- 
from some cause -PRON- hope mount high 
a feeling spring in -PRON- breast that all be not lose and that the messenger who be to call for the ebony box would ultimately receive -PRON- at -PRON- hand 
-PRON- would be difficult to account for this reassuring thought 
so far as the ebony box be concern the wile of mistress betsy seem to have be entirely successful 
nevertheless capt paul spur on with a more complacent spirit than -PRON- have have at any time since -PRON- have discover the loss of the paper 
by and by -PRON- draw rein at master door find master sparrow -PRON- enjoy a pipe on -PRON- veranda 
the gentleman greeting be sour and uncordial and -PRON- be plain -PRON- sad treatment at capt plantation still rankle in -PRON- bosom 
the visitor be not invite to dismount so -PRON- keep -PRON- saddle 
may i inquire master sparrow say capt paul if -PRON- have visitor here
