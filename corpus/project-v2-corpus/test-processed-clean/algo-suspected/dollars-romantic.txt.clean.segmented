Dollars Romantic William Wallace Cook Along the Black Canon Trail Wesley Whipple rode singing; and when he turned into Grand Avenue he scattered his husky ballads the full length of it, and on past the Five Points to corral in First Avenue.
He was always happy; but he was always twice as happy when he had money to spend as he was when “broke" and with difficult times in prospect.
Now he had thirty dollars in his pocket, the old reliable rabbit’s foot on his watch chain, and a note from Uncle Wes under the sweatband of his Stetson.
The note was responsible for arrival in Phoenix that bright, sunny afternoon, when all the birds were warbling in the tops of the cottonwoods along the town ditch, and chaffering melodiously among the umbrella trees and oleanders of the courthouse plaza.
For it was springtime and nesting time, and there is a difference even in sunny southern Arizona at such a season.
Blind Fate, always conjuring with a mortal's affairs, had made of that summons from Uncle Wes merely an excuse for Whipple to spend two days on a trail that had a big town at the end of it/ After the monotony of three months spent in “dressing down" plates and “hanging up" stamps in the Threeply gold mill, the prospect of picture shows enjoyed with Katie or Mamie or Lorena was not without its thrills.
And there was all of thirty pesos with which to finance a period of pleasure in the city.
True, Uncle Wes had said in his letter: sick; and this time it’s so blamed serious I feel like I wanted my only relative handy.”
But then, Uncle Wes was of the complaining kind and enjoyed his ailments.
Six times in three years he had called his nephew to town in the fear that he was already crossing the Great Divide; but the shadow had passed, and the Great Divide had receded from Uncle sky line.
And during these supposed crises Whipple had acted as nurse, without pay, thereby saving the canny Uncle Wes many dollars which otherwise would have gone to some stranger.
Uncle Wesley Plunkett was a tightwad and knew how to hang on to his money.
Uncle Wes had never lost any sleep worrying about his nephew, so the nephew could hardly be blamed if he had no hard and fast apprehensions regarding Uncle Wes.
Nevertheless, Whipple had a warm and sympathetic heart.
If he had really thought his uncle was critically ill, he would not have come singing into town that afternoon, and he would not have planned his program of innocent pleasures with such joyous abandon.
But when an imaginative relative has cried “Wolf half a dozen times and no wolf has materialized, what logical reason is there for thinking that a seventh summons should be taken in any other way than cum grano sjalis “with a grain of salt,” as the saying is?
So, in a pleasant frame of mind, Whipple rode into corral.
The bay horse, Baldy, which he had borrowed from the superintendent at the Three-Ply Mine, he turned over to Doolittle in person.
The proprietor of the corral did not greet Whipple effusively; in fact, he wore a sour expression and stood watching with knitted brows while the newcomer unhitched a dusty suit case from the saddle cantle. the matter, Lafe?” inquired Whipple, turning about, satchel in hand, to give the corral man a steady look.
“What means that fishy eye and forbidding manner?”
“You owe me six dollars, re-, turned Doolittle frankly, “and some of it has been runnin’ for two years.
This ainot no free corral, and I canot keep things goin' without the dinero.
You got to pay up what y'u owe or take your hoss some other place.
Sorry a heap I got to talk like this, but business is business, and I ainot here for my health.”
“Well, well Whipple pulled out his thirty dollars and subtracted six from the roll. a little matter like that between friends? your money, Lafe.”
Lafe Doolittle thawed immediately. wasnot worried a mite, he averred brightly, “but you know how it is.
Plunk is down ag'in “He writes me lie is.”
“The old curmudgeon is full o’ funny nations that a way. false alarm. too pesky ornery to kick the bucket and leave his boodle to you, or any one else. the one thing that keeps him on the turf canot bear to give up what he's got.” my uncle, Doolittle, and that sort of talk doesnot set well.” donot care how it sets, The truth never hurt nobody yet.
This hull town knows that when Plunk goes up the spout he'll take the spout right with him.
Darn little you'll git.
Bank on Plunk to fix it somehow.”
A feeling of loyalty to his only living relative brought a hot rebuke to lips; but he smothered the sharp words, realizing in his heart that there was considerable truth in remarks.
Leaving the corral with his suit case, Whipple made his way to the Hotel Fordham.
Felix Vannell, the day clerk, did not display much enthusiasm as he watched Whipple approach the counter and pick up a pen.
“Buenos, Felix,” said Whipple, in his friendliest manner.
“Howdy,” In that little word “howdy,” passed from friend to friend, can be wrapped up all the pleasant reminiscences of the past, a lot of present good cheer, and a cordial wish for future joys.
But all Felix, the day clerk, wrapped up in it was a perfunctory recognition right off the ice.
Whipple hung the inked pen over the register and stared hard at his quondam amigo. wrong he inquired.
“Is it possible not welcome here, Mr. Vannell?
Are you trying to chase me over to The Plaza got orders to chase eight dollars out o’ your clothes, before ever allowin’ you to register here again.”
It seemed to hurt Vannell to voice this ultimatum. had you on the slate for those eight plunks ever since last fall. sorry; but you know Pm only a hired man and donot own the place.”
“Why, shucks!” exclaimed Whipple.
“Everybody knows I pay my honest debts.
This is the first time been in town since last fall.”
He took out his twenty-four dollars and passed over eight of them to the clerk.
“Now are we all right?”
The eight dollars worked their instant magic.
All the frost vanished from the clerk’s face and manner.
Heartily he gripped the hand holding the pen, placed the register more conveniently, and sounded the alarm for Wing Loo the Chinaman bell hop. sure glad to see you, babbled Vannell.
“Uncle off his feed once more, eh?
Well, here’s hoping.”
“Hoping what?” queried Whipple, after carefully writing his name in the book.
“Why, that when Plunk does make up his mind to kick off he leaves you all his dough; but everybody says he wonot, or any part of it.
Still, we’re all hoping.” my uncle, my mother’s only brother, you're talking about, Vannell,” Whipple returned, “so you might use the soft pedal with me.
I donot want his money.”
“You could use it, couldnot you?”
Here was the old siren's song against which Whipple had stopped his ears ever since he had been old enough to realize what money meant in this world.
“Use it?” he echoed.
“Say He stopped short, however, and did not finish.
The enthusiasm that had rushed into his sun-browned face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.
“No chance,” he added.
“Anyhow, I couldnot be happy if I didnot stand on my own feet.
Same old room?”
“Sure handed a key to the Chinaman.
“Fifteen, Loo.”
“Fifteen,” echoed the careful Loo; “awri*.”
A little later, in room Whipple shaved himself, took a hot bath, and got into his best clothes, which he had brought along with him in the suit case.
All the gold mills in Arizona could not have turned out a finer-looking amalgamator than Wesley Whipple as he stood, clad in his best, onceymore in the Fordham lobby.
He stepped into a telephone booth and rang up the home of Mr. Galusha Mingo.
The head of the house answered, and his warm voice chilled when he discovered who was at the Fordham end of the wire.
Katie, Mr. Mingo?” queried Whipple, just a little unnerved by an intangible feeling that something more was wrong. well as usual, said Mingo, still distantly.
He was only six blocks away, but one might have imagined that he was six miles.
“Uncle Wes is under the weather again,” Whipple went on, “and in town for a spell.
But this evening is mine, and like to make a date with Katie to “You will make no more dates with Katie, young man,” and the receiver fairly snapped. thought you had prospects, but come to the conclusion you havenot.
You are always in debt you’ll never get ahead.
Out at the Mine you pull down thirty a week, but you never save a cent of it, and you owe everybody in town.
Katie canot afford to waste her time.
Bang And Mr. Galusha Mingo “hung up.”
Whipple was staggered, but only for a moment.
His acquaintance among the gentler sex was not limited to Katie Mingo, although his dreams were more about Katie than any other.
He called the boarding house of Miss Serena Haskins and asked for Miss Lorena Marlin, only to learn that Miss Marlin was out of town.
Then he had central give him Mr. Anson residence.
As luck would have it, Miss Mamie Philbrick answered the phone herself and, although her voice was courteous in the extreme, there was totally lacking any quality of pleasure.
Miss Philbrick was sorry, but she had an engagement for the evening.
“Compliments of Hardluck,” muttered Whipple as he replaced the receiver on the hooks and left the booth.
A man was waiting for him one Hathaway, a custom tailor.
He approached Whipple in the cautious manner of a hunter stalking an antelope.
“Hello, Hathaway called Whipple.
Hathaway nodded.
He was measuring the amalgamator with his eyes, taking in every detail of the nobby suit which had been built in his establishment and for which, as yet, he had received only a payment on account. a balance of thirty dollars on your bill, Hathaway said, “and you told me you would settle next time you were in town.”
“Well, here I am,” Whipple answered.
“This is the first time been in town since I got these clothes. be here probably for two or three days maybe longer.
Before I leave, Hathaway, But no, that would not do for Hathaway.
He believed a bird in the hand worth a whole flock in the bush.
Whipple was a fine chap, but his money had a way of getting away from him.
He would like a little something on account.
How about fifteen dollars, just half of what Whipple owed him?
Expenses were heavy and collections hard.
Hathaway would be very grateful to Whipple if he could pay something.
Whipple was touched with remorse and gave Hathaway all he had left sixteen dollars.
Then Hathaway, cheered and grateful, shook hands with Whipple and asked him to drop around and look at some new suitings which had just arrived.
After this he blithely left the hotel.
“Strapped murmured Whipple, sinking into a chair.
‘All dressed up and no place to go/ But got to go some place, or there’ll be more creditors here, and have to stand ’em off; and I certainly hate to sidestep a man to whom I owe an honest debt.
By George,” he told himself, jumping up, go and see Uncle Wes. not expecting me till late this evening, but give him a surprise. be safe with Uncle Wes.
Nobody with a bill ever calls on him.”
He left the hotel humming a song.
His mood was not so exalted as it had been while he was riding into town, but he was still happy in a subdued, irresponsible sort of way.
If he had to have more money, Uncle Wes might lend him some and take his watch for security. ten years ever since he had sold the Letty Lee Mine for three hundred and five thousand dollars Wesley Plunkett had tried with considerable success to convince himself that he was a confirmed invalid.
He was sixty years old, and stood six feet three in his stockings, running mostly to length and very little to breadth.
Some said he was “narrow,” others said he was “near,” but the majority said he was “close.”
All these colloquial phrases hit the one mark “tightfisted.”
His acquaintances referred to him among themselves as “Old Plunks.”
This sobriquet, harking back to the colloquial once more, was derived from the word “plunk,” meaning dollar, and also from middle name, Plunkett.
For ten years the old man had lived in Josh boarding house on Fourth Avenue, beating Hopper down in his rates a little with each succeeding year on the score of being a steady boarder.
So well did manage that his living had not cost him two hundred and fifty dollars a year; nor had his “amusements” cost him any more.
His only amusement consisted in patronizing quack doctors and in buying advertised tonics and nostrums.
Whenever he emptied a bottle he treasured it, finally selling the bottles in dozen lots at five cents a lot.
This bottle money kept him in smoking tobacco.
Among many queer ideas was his hatred of paying taxes.
He would have had a small house of his own, but that would have meant dealing with the assessor.
He had chances galore to invest his money safely at a good rate of interest, but the income tax would have caught him.
His funds were on deposit, subject to check, but just where they were, or how much they totaled, no supervisor had ever been able to discover.
The tax-exempt feature of municipal bonds had appealed to him once, but he had withstood the temptation to buy such bonds for he feared that the government would pass a law putting a tax upon them as soon as it was known that he had loaded up with the securities.
It was five o'clock in the afternoon when Whipple made his call upon his uncle.
The old man was reclining in a lazy-back, canvas chair on second-story porch.
On a table at his elbow were various panaceas in bottles, an empty glass, and a pitcher of water.
The invalid was smoking a corncob pipe and looking very pale and feeble.
He was too long for the chair, and his feet, in old carpet slippers, stuck out into space from beneath the Navajo blanket that sought to cover him.
“Well, said Uncle Wes, extending his hand with a painful effort, reckon this is the last time ever call you in from the Pull a chair up close. got to talk to you for a spell, and my voice is so weak it wonot carry far."
“Oh, I guess you're not so bad off, Uncle Wes," returned Whipple cheerily, placing a chair within confidential distance and seating himself.
“What seems to be the matter now?"
“Everything," answered Uncle Wes gloomily; “but the last thing to put a crimp into me is my heart.
Doc Flickinger says last three months. been right on the job, watching me every minute.
Why, paid him eleven dollars in the last two weeks!
Three months, After that, stop being an expense to myself, and everybody else.
First I want to tell you bought a place for myself out to the cem'tery. on Ham plot, and I got just room enough for one for five dollars.
Ham was needing money, so I picked it up at a bargain."
Being young, and more or less in love with life, these particulars gave Whipple a gruesome feeling. wouldnot talk about it, Uncle Weo," he admonished.
“Got to," insisted the other. reached a p'int where you’ve got to be in the know about every blamed thing, I want everything plain and simple; no fuss, feathers or trimmings.
Understand?
Prices are scandalous for things like that, and I want you to keep down the cost.
Promise Whipple promised hastily, eager for his uncle to shift the subject. having received the promise, drew a long breath of satisfaction, then refilled his pipe and lighted it.
“Your heart would be all right," averred Whipple, “if you stopped smoking so much, and if you cut out all that patent dope."
Uncle Wes frowned. got the darnedest notions," he grunted.
“Tobacco, and the stuff in them bottles, is all that’s keeping me alive. be around for three months; Doc Flickinger promises me three months."
“Maybe Doc Flickinger is wrong," Whipple suggested.
“Why donot you get a specialist from out of town?"
“And throw away good money, huh came scathingly from Uncle Wes. wrote Doc Mixinger, of Prescott, and asked what he'd charge to come down for a consultation.
And what do you think he 'wrote back?
Five hundred dollars!
Robber!
I offered him fifty, and he sent back a postal card sayin' 'Die in peace.'
And, by gorry, that’s what going to do.
I wonot be trimmed in my last days; never have been trimmed, and I wonot let any specialist begin It now.
Three months, bring it July fifteenth. miss the real hot weather, anyway."
Flickinger seems to have it figured out pretty fine,” Whipple commented.
“He figgered it out for Dan Jipley jest like that, He gave Dan nineteen days and a half, and Dan kept the appointment on the dot.
Same with Steve Suffern.
Doc gave him five months, and Steve didnot disapp’int him.
So I know got to hike on July fifteenth.
But that donot worry me. be cuttin’ off a bill of expense, and always found that cheerin’.
Hopper will take it hard, I expect. cn a pretty steady boarder here.
“You know how it was with me, All the time I was prospectin’ in the hills I had to live on cottonwood bark and niggerhead cactus, mostly.
They was tough times.
I had to skimp and save, and I sorto got into the habit; then, when I struck the Letty Lee, and sold out for a fortune, I didnot know how to spend what I had.
And that’s kind of worried me.
But the publicans By gorry,” and here Uncle Wes chuckled, kept away from the publicans.
No tax collector ever got me, and no tax collector is ever goin’ to. got three hundred thousand dollars. all in the banks, and not in the savings departments, either.
You re my only heir.
If I pass out and leave the three hundred thousand to you by will, there’ll be an inheritance tax to be paid.
But if I give you the money outright, as a free gift, there wonot be no tax inheritance, income, or otherwise.”
Whipple caught his breath.
“You you wouldnot do that, Uncle Wes!” he exclaimed. figgerin’ on it. the only way to beat the tax collectors, strain myself a lot to do that.
But I donot allow to give it to you all in a bunch. aimin’ to scatter it over three months, making the last and final donation on the evenin’ of Tulv fourteenth.”
This was overwhelming.
Uncle Wes had never given Whipple so much as a plugged nickel before.
And now he was going to present him with three hundred thousand dollars. call that mighty generous of you, Uncle Wes,” said the nephew, with feeling.
“Only uncle I ever had And always thought a lot of you.
I wonot squander the money; invest it and make it grow “No; you donot!”
Uncle Wes barked at him fiercely.
“If you invest it, and it grows, you’ll be payin’ taxes.
I wonot have that I wonot have a cent of my money invested and growin’ into taxes.
Get that straight, one reason going to hand the dinero to you in installments.
I want to watch you squander it, and have the good time with it that I ought to have had and didn know how.
You neednot squander the last installment, because I wonot be here to watch.
The final donation I want you to put in a bank in a checking account, and jest draw on it for livin’ expenses.
Get the idea?
Here, look at this.”
He drew an old wallet from his pocket and removed an oblong slip of paper.
Holding the slip for a moment, he looked at it with fond, greedy eves then, with an effort, he passed the 'slip to Whipple.
The latter’s fingers trembled, and his eyes dimmed somewhat.
It was a check, payable to his order, for one hundred thousand dollars. certified, said Uncle es, and you can cash it at any bank in town.
Spend it.
I want it all used up in thirty days, so you can come back to me, broke, and get another check like it on June fourteenth.
Then, on July fourteenth, you get the last one.
But remember, donot you lay out even a two-bit piece in hope of gain.
Those are my orders.
If you donot live up to instructions, that first check will be the last one. leave the rest of my money to charity some home for superannuated miners and prospectors, if there is any such thing. have thirty days to spend a hundred thousand dollars.
Show me how you do it.
Everybody says you’re a great spender, but I never learned the knack.
I stakin’ you to a round of pleasure now go out and make a business of bein’ happy. want you to be a gentleman about it, I know you are an honest soul, and that you have a lot of fine sensibilities inherited from your mother.
Your pa was short of ability as a moneymaker, and some other things, but you got an A inheritance of character from the Squander that money in a genteel way, but donot let one sou of it make anything through investments.
Report to me often in person or by letter; you see, Fm aimin’ to spend my last days enjoyin' your experiences.
I never was able to get any fun out of the money myself, so Fm plannin’ to take my fun secondhand.
Make it snappy, And if you throw in a few thrills, you’ll oblige.
When a man is packin’ for his trip across the Great Divide, same as me, a leetle excitement will make him forget the trip ahead of him and be, as you might say, soothin’.
As Fm preparing to lay down life, I want you to pick it up real life, mind— the kind missed.
I Faintly, somewhere within the confines of the boarding house, there sounded the musical notes of a triangle.
Uncle Wes stirred restlessly. goes the supper call, he said.
“Hopper charges four bits a meal for transients. like right well to have you stay and eat with me, but Fm short four bits in change.
If you happen to have it- havenot a red, Uncle Wes,” put in Whipple, “but my credit is good at the Fordham.”
Your credit ought to be good anywhere, with that paper I just gave you but the banks are closed, and Hopper wants cash on the nail.
Maybe you’d better go to the Fordham. when the banks open, you can begin to step high, wide, and handsome.
I only wished I was able to trot along with you, but it’s all I can do to walk from this porch to the dinin’ room.
This heart of mine wonot let me exercise.
Help me downstairs, and then you can go to your hotel and plan your campaign.
If you put away a dollar of that money where it brings any interest, remember, you're done.”
Whipple caught his breath once more.
He was hardly able to realize his good fortune.
As one in a waking dream he helped Uncle Wes out of the canvas chair, into the boarding house, and down the stairs to the door of the dining room.
There he thanked him mechanically, left him, and drifted out into the bright, beautiful afternoon.
One hundred thousand dollars, all his own!
Whipple was so dazed by it all that he barely missed being run down by a street car in Washington Street.
A Whipple came into the lobby of the Hotel Fordham, five men arose from their chairs and advanced upon him.
They had learned he was in town, and each had a bill.
One hundred dollars would pay every cent that Whipple owed and while that was a large amount to an amalgamator earning thirty a week, and with a thousand ways in which to lay out that meager stipend, it was a mere bagatelle to a young Croesus upon whom had devolved the pleasant duty of spending more than three thousand dollars a day for thirty days.
Whipple dropped into a chair while his creditors surrounded him and held out their statements of account.
Swayed by a spirit of mischief, Whipple mutely pulled his pockets inside out.
“Gentlemen,” he said, came into town with thirty dollars, and it is all gone.”
Five faces grew very long, and then came some peppery comments.
Whipple allowed this to continue until it got on his nerves then, with a flourish, he brought out his certified check and held it under five pairs of popping eyes.
“However,” he went on, “to-morrow, as soon as the banks open, I shall have the money.
Spread the good news that Monte Cristo, junior, will be at Hotel Fordham at eleven o’clock to-morrow morning, loaded to the guards with mazuma and ready to meet all comers with a claim on him.”
Money has a magic touch.
Long faces broadened and sour looks faded into genial smiles.
The man, the haberdasher, the jeweler who had overhauled watch.
Coffee of the short-order cafe, and the garage proprietor with a bill for taxis, all these nearly smothered Whipple with their kindly attentions.
One hundred thousand dollars!
The good will, mounting in a direct ratio with the size of the check, reached heights that Whipple found rather annoying.
He was known to be a good spender, whenever he had the cash, or if he did not have the ready money, wherever his credit was good.
But the limit of cash and credit, for a amalgamator, was modest.
The wealthy Wesley Plunkett because of his known character as a tightwad, never had influenced the merchants in putting Whipple on their books.
Now that had “loosened" in such a royal manner, however, every tradesman had cheerful glimpses of the nephew in the role of a princely spendthrift, and they began laying their plans accordingly.
Wrenching himself clear of the enthusiastic group, Whipple went in to dinner.
Every one, even the waiters, had a smile and a nod for him.
News of the cl\eck was traveling like wildfire.
It hardly seemed possible that Old Plunks had reversed himself so magnificently, but every one who smiled and nodded had seen some one who had seen somebody else who had feasted his eyes on that oblong square of negotiable, certified paper.
So the check was a fact; and the quickest way to get a little of money was to be on a friendly footing with lucky nephew.
Later in the evening, Whipple found time to do a little sober thinking.
In order to be completely strapped by next May fourteenth, it would be necessary for him to spend three thousand three hundred and thirty-three dollars every day.
And he could make no investments; all the money would have to go for a good time a period of pleasure, snappy and full of thrills, if the approval of Uncle Wes was to be won.
The problem, when considered at some length, gave Whipple a sinking sensation.
On one evening, the previous fall, he, had spent fifteen dollars and forty cents.
This maddening round of pleasure had included taxicab hire, a picture show, a dance, and then a little supper and Katie Mingo had been his companion.
He had given that jamboree all the trimmings he could imagine, even buying Katie a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates.
He had considered it a wonderful plunge; and he recalled how Katie had gently reproved him for his extravagance.
But that fifteen forty wasnot a circumstance to the obligations that faced him now.
How in Sam Hill was he going to spend more than three thousand dollars a day for the next thirty days?
“It canot be done!" he told himself gloomily.
“All the pleasures I know anything about wouldnot cost me three thousand a month in this man's town."
Like many another man, Whipple had often dreamed of the fun he would have if some kind-hearted genie would toss a million dollars into his lap.
Now, faced with cold fact, he couldnot devise ways and means for getting rid of one tenth of a million.
He needed help.
In a flash of inspiration he thought of “Concho" Charley Vandeever.
By George, that was an idea Vandeever was an old-time friend of and his proud boast was that he never had anything more than a Stetson on his mind.
Charley Van was a cowboy.
An aunt in the East had died and left him four thousand dollars.
The moment he got the money, Charley Van had excused himself from the ranch and in just ten days he was back at the Tumbling punching cows again, flat broke.
That feat of Concho had gone down in the history of the cattle country as a performance never before equaled it had even been perpetuated in a song entitled, “Charley and the Wad that Wilted," and so had been embalmed for all time as a lesson to spendthrifts.
As soon as he could get to a telegraph office, Whipple sent the following message, marking it “Rush:" Charley Vandeevef, Tumbling Ranch, Prescott, Arizona.
Got to get rid of one hundred thousand dollars in thirty days.
Come on and help.
At the rate of four thousand dollars in ten days, supreme effort would have amounted to only twelve thousand dollars in a month.
If that was the best he could do, then Whipple was leaning on a broken reed.
Nevertheless, he had confidence in Charley Van.
His experience would be valuable, and there was no telling what prodigal heights he might not attain if backed with unlimited funds.
The nimble fancies of a free range would suggest ways and means for pleasuring not to be found within the four walls of a gold mill.
Two heads were better than one in the emergency, anyhow, and there was nothing in Uncle instructions barring an assistant spender.
Whipple went to bed that night in a fairly comfortable frame of mind.
Next morning at ten o'clock he deposited his check in a checking account and drew three thousand three hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-four cents.
He would try his prentice hand at getting rid of it before midnight.
Charley Van could not possibly connect with the telegram and reach the side of his hard-pressed friend before some time the following day; meanwhile, Whipple could experiment unaided with his latent powers as a spendthrift.
He had a chance to begin just as he turned from the paying teller’s window.
“Hello, called a voice.
“Put 'er there, son been trailing around for two hours trying to find you.
Congratulations A chunky man in a shiny Prince Albert coat, a slouch hat, and trousers bagged at the knees, stood in front of Whipple and held out his hand.
He was middle-aged, had gray chin whiskers, and wore a pair of large, tortoiseshell glasses.
This person had the look of an amiable owl, and his advances were more than friendly.
“Doc Flickinger exclaimed Whipple, taking the hand.
“Erasmus Flickinger, by special appointment at cut rates physician in ordinary to that doomed and unhappy man, your uncle."
Still clinging to hand, Flickinger pulled him close and whispered in his ear miss him but Hopper, eh?
Well, such is life, and we never know what minute is going to be the next.
Auricles and ventricles all shot to pieces, and now there's a valvular lesion.
July fifteenth, along about three in the afternoon, I should say, will tell the story.
How about a commission “Commission?" echoed Whipple, freeing himself and drawing back to look full at the “Sure," went on Flickinger; “always customary.
If I hadnot given him three months you wouldnot be pulling down a hundred thousand a month. the source of your good luck.
Ten per cent, all right?"
“You are barking up the wrong tree, Flickinger," replied Whipple coldly not handing anybody an honorarium for giving my uncle bad news."
“Make it one per cent then," begged Flickinger.
“All I can pry out of Old Plunks is fifty cents a call.
Even it up for me.
Just a measly thousand for shaking this plum tree for you."
“Fifty cents a call is about half a dollar more than your calls are worth.
Not a cent, Flickinger!
This demand of yours is worse than unprofessional it's an attempted holdup."
With that, Whipple pushed on out of the bank.
He had no confidence in Erasmus Flickinger, even though he had developed some success as a prognosticator in a patient's length of days.
His gorge rose at the brazen demand for a commission on the misfortunes of •Uncle Wes; but out of his indignation there came an idea.
Making his way to the telegraph office, he proceeded to wire five hundred dollars to Doctor Mixinger, of Prescott, and request his immediate attention in the matter of Wesley Plunkett Five hundred dollars, plus telegraph tolls, made cheering inroads upon the necessary disbursements of the day; and Whipple could not have spent the money for anything that would have contributed more to his personal pleasure.
On his way back to the hotel, attention was arrested by the fact that all Phoenix seemed to know of his good fortune.
Somehow, it had got into the morning papers.
He bought one, crossed over to the courthouse plaza, seated himself on a bench, and read the racy account of what must have struck the townspeople as a sevendays’ wonder.
The heading ran: Whipple, from Three-Ply, Strikes it Rich.
Young Amalgamator at Mine Rides into Phoenix and Drops into a Fortune.
Easy Come, Easy Go, is the String to it.
And Uncle Wes Holds the End of the String.
There, on his bench in the plaza, Whipple leaned back in the shade of an oleander and smiled a little.
Was he becoming famous or notorious?
He wondered, and then continued to read: Wesley Whipple, more power to his open hand, is said to be a spender.
Well, has now the chance of a lifetime to prove it.
He must spend one hundred thousand dollars a month for the next two months, solely for his own pleasure and without making any investments that might bring money returns; and then, if he measures up to expectations, there will be another hundred thousand dollars for him to put in the bank, and draw on only as he needs it for living expenses.
Query: Will he develop such prodigal habits during the two months that his third hundred thousand will take wings and, finally, leave him stranded in mill with only his salary as amalgamator for a stake in life?
The experiment will be watched with interest by the many friends of in this town.
It appears that our wealthy townsman, has discovered that he has only three months to live.
Mr. as all know, is an old prospector of frugal habits, who turned up a fortune when he discovered and sold the famous Letty Lee Mine in the Harqua Halas.
Ever since that time, ten years ago, he has been in failing health.
He declares that he knows how to save money, but has never acquired the knack of spending it for his own comfort and pleasure.
So, as his days draw toward a close, he turns his wealth over to his nephew in liberal monthly installments, to be spent at the rate of more than three thousand dollars a day in the quest of joy and happiness.
And Mr. whose eccentricity is well known, asserts that by this method he will be securing thrills and excitement by watching his nephew riot away a fortune. must be flat “broke” at the end of his thirty days; if he is not, the deal is off, and he will not receive the second stake for another jamboree of thirty days.
And he cannot invest in anything that will bring monetary returns every red cent he disburses must go for comfort and pleasure; and the question naturally arises, how may a man of ingrained habits, based upon the spending of a hundred or so a month, blossom out as the regal spender of a hundred thousand a month?
It looks easy, but is it as easy as it looks?
We extend our condolences to Mr. and to his nephew, Mr. Whipple, also, unless he can prove, as the spendthrift days go on, that he is entitled to congratulations.
Whipple was laughing at this story in the paper when he looked up to see a young man standing in front of him.
“Mr. Wesley Whipple?” inquired the stranger. nicked it.” am Carter Wainwright, of the Ne Plus Ultra Sales Company, Mr. Whipple. got a lot of money to spend, and the right way to begin is by buying a Ne Plus Ultra automobile.
It will set you back twenty-five hundred dollars, but will give you twenty-five thousand dollars’ worth of pleasure.
Six other automobile salesmen are waiting for you at the hotel, but I have stolen a march on them by overhauling you in the plaza.
Now, the Ne Plus Ultra is the classiest car on the market to-day.
It comes equipped with cord tires, has “All right, Mr. Wainwright,” cut in Whipple; take one. you charge me more by throwing in a few extras?”
“Possibly.
Come over to the salesroom and we’ll fix you up.
By George,” enthused Mr. Wainwright, “this is the easiest and quickest sale made since been in the business “You caught me at what they call the psychological moment,” was comment.
He arose from the bench, the salesman hooked an arm through his, and they started for the place where the Ne Plus Ultras were to be had. superintendent at the mine had a Ne Plus Ultra car and Whipple, having a “turn” for mechanics, had repaired it, and tinkered with it, and driven it, until there was nothing about the Ne Plus Ultra with which he was not thoroughly familiar.
So he drove his shiny new machine back to the Fordham, and left it out in front while he went into the hotel and became involved in the designs of a greedy mob that filled the lobby and had been waiting for him.
He singled out his creditors and paid them off.
Three gamblers, led by Montgomery King otherwise Monte/’ he summarily dismissed with the emphatic declaration that he was “out to get a run for his money” and not to enrich the card sharps.
“Mogollon” Mike Moloney, a poverty-stricken prospector whom h$ had known for years and who, at that moment, was particularly down on his luck, he presented with fifty dollars.
Four mining brokers, with “good things,” in which they wanted to interest him, had their ardor dampened by the statement -that he wasnot allowed to invest a point they would not have missed if they had read the morning papers carefully.
At noon he went into the dining room for luncheon, thrilled and cheered by the fact that, in two hours, he had spent more than thirty-two hundred dollars and had only a trifle of eighty-eight dollars and some cents left.
He was making good, by George!
He hadnot found it difficult at all.
By the time he had finished his noon meal another crowd had gathered in the lobby, each member of it primed with suggestions for helping him get rid of his hundred thousand.
Evading these callers, he dodged out at a side door, reached his waiting automobile with a rush and a jump, kicked at the selfstarter, let in the clutch, and was off for a ride through the countryside.
The car worked like a charm; and just to handle the controls, and realize that everything from the headlights forward to the tail light aft was his very own, caused him the most delightful sensations.
His afternoon spin carried him out along the Cave Creek Road, around by the Indian School, and then back to town again.
If only Katie, or Mamie, or Lorena had been with him his enjoyment would have been complete.
But which one of the three would he have enjoyed most to have along?
Ordinarily his answer would have been Katie, but Pa hard jolt over the phone had rather dazed and discouraged him so far as Katie was concerned.
And Mamie Philbrick had turned him down, courteously but not with any regret that he had been able to discover.
Miss Lorena Marlin had been out of town.
In the absence of any disconcerting word from Miss Marlin, he rather guessed that he would have enjoyed most her company on the little afternoon spin.
In the lobby of the Fordham the ranks of those with designs on his money, had been reenforced by several newspaper men who were looking for a “story.”
He refused himself to all of them after Felix Vannell had caught his ear and poured into it the information that three ladies were in the parlor, upstairs, waiting to see him.
The wide doors of the parlor, hung with portieres, opened at the head of the -first flight.
As Whipple came close to one of the swinging curtains, a voice that was very familiar struck on his ear: knew him first, and he’s mine by the right of discovery.
You two may as well be on your way.”
That was Lorena Marlin speaking.
Her gurgling, musical voice, which had always seemed so cute and childlike to Whipple, had lost some of its rich cadence and was tinged with temper.
He stopped to debate with himself, and more conversation drifted out to him.
“You may have known him first, Miss Marlin, but when he called up last night and you had Serena Haskins tell him you were out of town, I guess that let you out.
Oh, I got wise to that!
Wesley will feel fine when he hears you were in the boarding house all the time and didnot want to see him.”
“Well, Miss Smarty, since you know so much tell you something that am wise to.
He phoned to you yesterday, didnot he?
And you told him you had another engagement, but you never had any callers and werenot out of the house all evening.
So I guess we’re even.”
Whipple was terribly shaken by this cross fire between Lorena Marlin and Miss Mamie Philbrick.
He had no business standing there and listening to it, but he could hardly have avoided hearing disclosures.
Were these girls like all the others?
Had Wesley Whipple become popular with them merely because of the hundred thousand dollars?
He drew out his handkerchief and passed it over his moist brows. think you are just horrid, both of you!”
Here came a third voice, equally familiar to Whipple, but vastly more pleasing.
Katie Mingo was speaking.
Her tones expressed indignation, and there was nothing in them of a spiteful quality.
Whipple clutched at them as at a straw of hope.
A mocking laugh greeted words. horrid, are we?” returned Lorena Marlin.
“Well, how has your father been talking about Wes Whipple these last few weeks?
Nothing but an amalgamator, and will be anything but an amalgamator!
Just a spendthrift with no eye on his future at all A good-enough fellow, but lacks stability! called on my Katie for the last time, if got anything to say about it! how your father feels about Wes Whipple, Miss Mingo, and he has published his opinions all over town.
Step lightly, my dear; step lightly Whipple thought it was high time to appear on the scene.
He coughed, flung back his shoulders, and showed himself between the portieres.
A cry of delight welcomed him, and Lorena and Mamie sprang up from their chairs and hurried forward.
Katie remained seated by a window and did not join in the demonstration.
Lorena had black hair and black eyes, and Katie had flaxen hair and blue eyes, while Mamie was neither a brunette nor a blonde.
All were lovely of feature and form, but a flash of revelation had shown Whipple that the characters of at least two of them were not so lovely.
He bowed in his best manner.
“Congrats, Wes!” cried Lorena, putting out her hand. always thought your uncle would do something for you, Wes,” Mamie remarked “and isnot it fine How are you making it?” making it fly,” Whipple answered.
“Oh, we knew you would exclaimed Lorena in her most bewitching manner.
“You were always so generous, Wes, and such a decided contrast to Mr. come to invite you over to Miss Haskins’ to dinner this evening.”
“And here to ask you to our house to dinner,” spoke up Mamie.
“And I was here first, waiting for you, Wes.”
“But I have known you longer than any of the others!” said Lorena.
“You werenot out of town last night, Miss Marlin, and Miss Philbrick had no engagement.”
Whipple could have made these statements of fact very cutting, but it was not in him to be disagreeable to the ladies.
He smiled as he spoke.
“So,” he went on, am sure you will not be very much disappointed if I tell you that I have other plans for this evening.”
He walked over to Katie.
“Miss Mingo,” he inquired, “why arenot you congratulating me thought wait,” answered Katie.
“The truth is, I donot know whether you are to be congratulated or not.
Time will tell about that, Wes.
If the papers are to be believed, the conditions under which your uncle is giving you the money may prove a handicap in the long run.
Father wants* you to come to dinner at our house this evening.”
“Then he has reversed himself?
His opinions about me have undergone a change since Uncle Wes proved so liberal?”
Mamie and Lorena tittered. fair face flushed painfully.
Whipple was sorry at once that he had spoken in just that way.
Before Katie could answer, he went on “Suppose we take a ride in my new car and talk it over?
Just out around Camelback Mountain. get you home in time for supper.”
He offered his arm.
Katie arose, put her hand through the arm and crossed with Whipple to the wide doorway.
Mamie had lost the power of speech and had dropped into a chair.
Not so Lorena; she seated herself quickly at a piano, thrummed a few notes, and began to sing.
He; voice followed Katie and Whipple as they descended the stairs Katie, be waiting at the door.”
“Oh, dear!” gasped Katie, in charming confusion.
“Never mind,” said Whipple cheerily.
“It is a little hard to find out who our real friends are, sometimes; especially,” he added, “when one happens to have a hundred thousand dollars to spend.
That money of Uncle is going to prove a great education to me.”
They had a wonderful ride; and not the least wonderful part of it was explanation of the way her father had reversed himself. sentiments were never mine,” she told Whipple earnestly. know he has always thought well of you, but he has had such hard luck all his life that he canot bear to see any one squandering money.
And he has been in debt so much himself, that it fills him with horror to see a young man starting life as he says completely surrounded with bills.
He has watched you carefully for the last three years, ever since you began calling at our house.
You you didnot seem to improve, Wes, and so he took the stand he did.
After he talked with you, I tried hard to get you at the hotel myself, but couldnot.
Now worried for fear you’ll think like Lorena and Mamie inviting you to dinner because you have suddenly come into a lot of money.”
“No, Katie; never think that of you,” Whipple averred. never forget how I spent fifteen dollars and forty cents, once, and you called me down for being so extravagant.
Mamie and Lorena were always urging me to go the limit. different.”
“Well,” Katie continued, donot want you to come to our house to dinner to-night, Wes.
Father is desperately in need of ten thousand dollars, and I know he's planning to ask you for it.
If you come “Bless your heart. not come,” cut in Whipple.
“Your wish is enough for me, Katie.
But like to lavish some of this money on you, if I can. to buy happiness with it; and I canot think of any happier way to spend it than to spend jt with you.” do wish you could save it, Wes; save it, and use it in getting ahead.
It isnot right to throw away so much money.”
It was almost six o’clock when Whipple halted the car in front of door, let Katie out, and then drove on toward the hotel.
Galusha Mingo met his daughter as she entered the house.
“He wouldnot come to dinner?” he asked.
“No, father,” answered Katie brightly.
“You told him what I wanted?”
“Yes,” she answered dutifully.
Galusha Mingo rubbed his hands.
“Then you have planted the seed, and it will grow and bear flower and fruit, my dear.
We shall see what we shall see.”
While he was uttering this oraculaf comment, Whipple was just crossing the street car track to drive into a garage.
His work of driving was purely mechanical, for his thoughts were all about Katie and the delightful two hours he had just spent with her.
He did not hear the jangled warning of an approaching street car; and the first he knew of his danger was a tremendous crash.
One side of the Ne Plus Ultra doubled up and, wrecked and broken, it was rolled and pushed along the track.
Whipple himself had been thrown through the wind shield by the impact, and was lying crumpled and unconscious in the street in front of the garage.
It had all happened so quickly that even the crowds on the sidewalks were slow in realizing that there had been an accident.
A awoke to find himself lyvv ing on three chairs in a drug store.
Doc Flickinger was bending over him.
Both arms and one foot had been bandaged, and Flickinger was now decorating his face with court-plaster.
“Get out he said to Flickinger.
“Fm all right.” remarked Flickinger to the druggist and the druggist’s two clerks.
“As near as I can make out he’s got a compound fracture of the tibia, lacerated ligaments of both arms, and very grave internal injuries.
Call the ambulance and we’ll send him to a hospital.”
“No; you donot!” cried Whipple. staying at the Fordham, and that’s where going, right now.”
With that, he got off the three chairs and started for the door.
Although he limped, Wesley Whipple walked remarkably well for a man with a compound fracture of the tibia.
Flickinger chased after him wildly, but he braced himself in the doorway, turned and shook a bandaged fist under nose. have some internal and external injuries yourself if you try to trail after me,” he threatened.
Flickinger was intimidated and fell back.
Hatless, coatless, bandaged, and wearing only one shoe, Whipple turned a corner and walked half a block to the Hotel Fordham.
The usual crowd of schemers was lying in wait for him, but the sight of Whipple in this gruesome condition was discouraging, and only Felix Vannell and the Chinese bell hop accosted him.
“For the love o’ Pete,” exclaimed the clerk; the matter, “Accident,” said Whipple, “but it isnot as bad as it looks.”
“Want a doctor?”
“No; all I want is to get up to my room.”
The Chinaman helped him, got him to his room on the second floor, and would have continued his ministrations had Whipple not ordered him out.
Then Whipple locked the door and proceeded to remove the bandages.
There was absolutely no need of them, so far as Whipple could discover.
The compound fracture and the lacerated ligaments, so feelingly mentioned by Doc Flickinger, were wholly imaginary.
Whipple kicked the bandages into one corner of the room and aired his opinion of Flickinger in burning words.
He realized that he was shaken and bruised, and that the glass of the broken wind shield made necessary the three bits of court-plaster that decorated his face.
Aside from this, however, he had suffered no injuries.
Being an athletic person, and hard as nails, as the saying is, he had come through that accident remarkably well.
A hand tried the knob of his door, then the same hand drummed a summons on the panel.
It was Vannell, and he brought a coat, hat, and the missing shoe.
“These were just brought to the office, he explained. shy fifty-eight dollars and a quarter, Felix,” said Whipple.
“See if it’s in the coat.”
It was not in the coat, and Whipple was forced to the conclusion that when he was thrown from the car he must have emptied his pockets into the street.
He still had his watch and chain and the rabbit’s foot charm; and for these, and for his wonderful good luck, he was very thankful.
Vannell reported that the car was a total wreck, that brand-new Ne Plus Ultra which Whipple had owned and enjoyed for only a few fleeting hours.
But the situation had its amenities.
Whipple was cleaned out of every cent of the money which he had drawn for the day’s spending.
He laughed jubilantly, while the clerk looked on and wonclered if he was right in his mind.
“In half an hour, Felix,” Whipple instructed, “send my dinner up to my room/* The clerk retired and Whipple locked himself in again then he took a hot bath and, greatly refreshed, crawled into bed.
When his dinner came, he ate with a heartiness that in no way suggested the invalid.
About eight o’clock Vannell brought him an evening paper and two telegrams.
The clerk was off duty and would have liked to sit down and talk, but Whipple made it plain that he was in no mood for company. lot of people have called up and asked about you,” said Vannell, “Galusha Mingo among others.
Mingo gave orders that you were not to be disturbed, and informed us that he is in charge of your case.
That all right, It was pleasant to know that father was taking such an interest in him.
Whipple informed the clerk that it was all right, and was once more left to himself.
One telegram was from Doctor Mixinger “Will run down Friday and give your uncle my best attention.”
The other message was from Charley Van, had been sent “collect” and was charged against Whipple on the books of the hotel: “Got you, pard. go out and take a view of the universe. spend a red till I get there and show you how.
Will arrive Thursday a. m.”
Whipple went to sleep that night feeling splendidly but he awoke next morning, lame and sore and with an ache in all his joints.
He tried to get up and dress, but toppled back into bed again.
It was borne in on him that he was doomed to take a day off, and that his riotous spending would have to be broken for a interval.
At the end of that time, however, Charley Van would be with him in person, and there would be two heads to plan and four hands to scatter the largess of Uncle Wes.
It was a quieting thought. reflections had mostly to do with Katie Mingo during that inactive day.
And he happened to remember that her father was in need of ten thousand dollars.
It occurred to him that, unknown to Katie, he might bestow that amount upon Galusha Mingo, win his abiding friendship, and get rid of more than a three days’ allowance of Uncle money.
Galusha Mingo had studied for the law, only to find that he could not earn his salt as a lawyer.
He had then given his attention to assaying, and now had a little shop about six doors from corral.
The business was not prosperous, and Mingo had a hard time to get along.
He was a psychologist, and he brought so much of the shadowy science into his business affairs that possibly the fact accounted for his failures.
He had the faculty, nevertheless, of seeing good things in a business way, and if he had had the funds with which to back up his analysis of opportunities he might have been a rich man.
At the present moment he was very busy with affairs; and oa Wednesday afternoon, about three o’clock, the angle of his activities was brought very forcibly and not very pleasantly home to the young man in room Mr. Mingo called and with him there came a little, sharp-visaged man who seemed deeply interested in the state of health.
Mingo introduced his companion as Jules Fortheringham, a claim agent.
The plunged at once into the business of the interview. brand-new automobile was a total wreck.
It had cost him, just a few hours before the accident, something like twenty-six hundred dollars.
It was a miracle, as you might say, that Whipple himself had not been killed outright.
Seemingly, he had come off extraordinarily well.
He was feeling fairly well at the moment, and yet who* knew what might not develop in the days or weeks to come?
Mingo had visions of Whipple walking with a cane or a crutch for the rest of his life.
That was a possibility.
The claim agent recognized the possibility and he was ready to give a check for five thousand dollars, part to reimburse Whipple for the loss of the car, and the rest to in16 sure the company against any further claims.
“But I am all right,” asserted Whipple, “and I donot want to gold-brick anybody.”
Galusha Mingo put up a restraining hand.
Whipple thought he was all right, but time alone could tell whether he was or was not.
Disease, resulting from the accident, might creep into his system in course of time and put him completely out of the running.
“Then, again,” Whipple continued to protest, “Pm not so sure that the street car was at fault.
I Galusha Mingo interrupted hastily to state that there were six eyewitnesses who would all swear that the street car was at fault.
It is probable that heredity has less to do with this matter of “being square” than environment.
The child of the most honest parents in the world will be marred for life if abandoned, in the tender years, to evil surroundings; but he will grow up a credit to those who bore him if right teachings are sifted into his environment with discrimination and care.
Whipple, in his extreme youth, had been well grounded in proper principles, and he now rebelled against the course along which Mingo was hurrying him. donot care about your eyewitnesses,” he said; know that what happened was due entirely to my own carelessness.”
That settled it.
Jules Fortheringham pushed a bundle of papers, with which he had been busy, back into his pocket.
“This frankness is er most unusual where a soulless corporation and easy money are concerned,” he remarked.
“Who was the old chap who went hunting with a lantern for an honest man?
He could have found his prize right here in room the Fordham.”
He shook hands with Whipple.
“Son,” he went on, as he moved to the door and paused there, “let me tell you something You canot spend or throw away a red cent without making an investment and the returns are bound to be made manifest in spite of yourself.
Just remember that.
Galusha Mingo, to all appearances, was bitterly disappointed.
He turned on Whipple, the moment they were alone together, and vented his feelings.
“Young man,” he said angrily, “you havenot an idea of the value of money.
If you ever expect to get married, what business have you got turning down a chance like that?
Less to yourself than to the lady who will some day be Mrs. Whipple you are under an obligation to get ahead.
On the chance that my little girl might somehow be concerned in your future plans, I was trying to help you.
Flickinger made out as good a case for you as he could he was to receive ten per cent of the gross and I certainly pulled the wires for you in masterful fashion.
Now you have knocked everything into a cocked hat!”
He started for the door.
“Katie is grieved over this orgy of fool spending,” Mingo went on.
“She is a woman, and takes to heart more than she ought to the deliberate manner in which you are shattering your future. going to send her to an aunt in Los Angeles, so she wonot be anywhere near this scene of criminal extravagance.
I feel that it will be best.”
He jerked the door open but, before he could leave, Whipple stayed him with a word. am trying to give my uncle a little excitement and a few thrills in his last days, Mr. Mingo,” he explained, as the other turned back.
“In that desk, over in the corner, is a check book and pen and ink.
May I trouble you to bring them to me?”
Mingo obeyed orders; and Whipple wrote out a check to him for ten thousand dollars.
“Katie told me yesterday that you are desperately in need of this amount of money,” Whipple went on, as he passed over the check, “and I am glad to oblige an old friend.
I would suggest, however, that you do not tell Katie anything about it.
She might not approve.”
Mingo was touched almost to tears.
‘Til give you my note, he said huskily.
“If you do, Fll tear it up.
That is a free gift.
I am empowered to spend the hundred thousand in ways that will bring me the most pleasure.
Looked at in such a way, if the donation means anything to you it means infinitely more to me.”
“My whole life turns right at this point,” continued Mingo feelingly; “on behalf of my family and myself, I thank you from my heart.”
“Are you still of a mind to send Katie to Los Angeles?”
“On second thoughts,” returned Mingo, believe leave that move to Katie herself.”
Thursday morning Whipple was feeling much better.
He was out of bed by seven and torturing his weary muscles with setting-up exercises.
The cold bath and brisk rub down that followed brought a warm glow and a feeling of exhilaration.
The complaints of his dependable nerves and sinews were very mild indeed, and only just enough to remind him that he had been in a collision.
The patches of court-plaster, of course, still remained as souvenirs.
He was busily shaving when something like an avalanche bumped against his locked door.
He opened it and fell into the fond embrace of Charley Van. me, you old seed,” whooped the cowboy, “ready to take your little hand in mine and go out and put some fancy crimps in the big wad.
Things was gettin’ so monotonous down at the ranch that life wasnot popular at all.
Your call reached me at the physicogical moment, as the man says.
Say, honest, I wasnot never in better trim to ramble around and scatter simoleons than I am this minute.
But you ainot stringin' me, are you?
If that roundelay you're singin' is the goods, why are you holed up in a Jim Crow room like this when you ort to be in the bridal suite?
What you shavin' yourself for when you ort to have a A barber in chief, a hot-towel holder, and a bootblack on your pay roll?
Seems like there's somethin' wror. here."
Charley Van was twenty-seven.
His eyes were brown, and his hair was an auburn shade and had a tendency to curl.
He wore a wide-brimmed hat, a gray flannel shirt and a pair of corduroy trousers; and all these various articles of wear, it was painfully evident, had seen better days.
If the clothes had fitted him they would have improved his appearance, but the hat was at least two sizes too small, while shirt and trousers were several sizes too large.
Whipple pushed his friend into a chair, gave him a package of cigarettes and, while the shaving proceeded, explained about Uncle Wes and the money.
He finished with an account of his first two days' exploits as a spendthrift, and Charley almost wept over the good money gone with such a miserly return in personal enjoyment.
“Gettin' solid with the father of the girl you're aimin' to marry by coughin' up ten thousand perfectly good dollars,” Charley wailed, “was about as locoed a play as any human ever put over. ainot quoted at much more than a hundred a throw, if they're in the market at all.
You been worked; and I donot want you to get mad if I allow that more'n likely the girl helped.
But that pufformance, star of its kind as it is, ainot much behind vour fool refusal to accept five thousand dollars from the claim agent.” not at the receiving end, Charley,” said Whipple apologetically; a disbursing agent.”
“And all as a disburse^ tell a man.
Uncle Wes will prob'ly get excited over the way that ten thousand went, but gamble a blue stack he wonot be real thrilled.
As I figger it, you've only got about eightysix thousand left.
Now I got to revise my plans, and sort o' cut 'em down.
How soon before you can stake me to a thousand and turn me loose for a few gay hours?
You see, I got into a game o' draw, cornin' down from Prescott, and a tinhorn I played with corralled sixteen dollars that was in my clothes, and then the clothes.
What I got on was donated by a capper exceptin' the lid; and that I took a guy asleep in the smokin' car. guarantee to massacree a thousand plunks for you before noon, if you'll stake me; then, to'rd evenin', we'll hop the fast train for Los Angeles."
Whipple started.
“Why Los Angeles?" he inquired. plannin' to hit a place where we can get value received in untrammeled joy for every dollar we put out," Charley expounded. wise to this game, You see, I been through the mill.
What could we get for our dinero in this man's town, providin' we donot play the game of give-away?
Nothin’ to mention.
We want to go where we can hit the ceilin', and even lift it a trifle.
The blue sky for ours, I ainot had no breakfast yet.
How long before we eat and I corral that measly thousand?" eat now, Charley," Whipple returned, “and give you the thousand just as soon as the bank’s open.
Then we'll call on Uncle Wes, and report."
“Mebby I hadnot better go with you to see Uncle Wes," Charley advised; “mebby you hadnot better say a word about me helpin’.
He might get the idee that your money wonot last thirty days, if mixed up with it.
And here's somethin' else: Suppose this new doc you've hired discovers that Uncle Wes has got thirty years yet instead o' three months to be with us I wouldnot trust Doc Flickinger to analyze a case of distemper in a sick kyoodle if I happened to own the dog."
“If Uncle Wes is to be spared to live to a ripe old age," said Whipple sincerely, “it will make me happy."
“Happy!" the cowboy jeered.
“Say, that old tax-dodgin' skinflint will be after you hot blocks to get back his money jest the minute he finds Flickinger was wrong with his figgers. have to do a fade-out before that happens."
Whipple was ready for the street, and Charley got up and looked him over with a critical eye.
“That automobile wreck didnot do a thing to your oufit, did it?" he remarked.
“You need some glad rags yourself, eat, and then both go after the ready-mades."
They had breakfast in the hotel and Charley Van sent six times for a fresh supply of wheat cakes.
After the meal, they started through the lobby on their way to the street, but were blocked by another crowd of schemers with designs on money.
The cowboy made short work of them, and plowed his way through the press with sarcastic comments and a threat of using his fists.
At an establishment where garments were sold, they made their selections.
The bill was four hundred and sixty dollars, but it included everything from hats to shoes.
Each climbed into his new outfit, and then a clerk accompanied them to the bank to make sure the bill was paid.
Whipple drew’ three thousand dollars, settled for the clothes, turned a thousand over to his friend, and then they separated.
Where Charley went Whipple did not know, but Whipple himself made his way to Josh boarding house to make his first report in person.
Uncle Wes was sprawled on the same second-story porch, in the same canvas chair, with the same bottles on the table and the same look of weary resignation in his face.
“Then it didnot kill you after ail, he remarked, as he feebly put out his hand.
“My money's a curse, ainot it?
I canot even pass it on to you with the curse wiped off.
How much you spent?
Twenty dollars?" spent nearly fourteen thousand dollars, uncle," Whipple answered, without emotion.
Uncle Wes furnished plenty of emotion.
In fact, he almost dropped out of his canvas chair.
“Another shock like that, he gasped, “and my heart will stop right here.
Fourteen thou Say, you never!
Well, you wonot get no more out o' me until next June fourteenth.
You better be careful.
I never spent that much in my hull life. you do it?”
The old man filled and lighted his pipe and composed himself for a period of enjoyment.
But he was disappointed.
The thrills he was expecting did not appear.
Whipple said nothing about Charley Vandeever, and dwelt only lightly on the amount expended for clothes.
For reasons of a different nature he failed to mention the money given to Mingo and the five hundred sent to Doctor Mixinger.
His story had mainly to do with the new automobile and the way it had been wrecked. never took no stock in them godevils, anyways,” commented Uncle Wes. ainot enjoyed your experiences any yet.
What else you done, you amuse me at all? a lot more that hasnot been accounted for.”
Whipple grew uneasy.
“My other expenditures, for the present, must remain a secret,” he said. begin to find out about them to-morrow.” begun to find out about ’em already,” was the peppery answer.
“Katie Mingo was here to see me, last evening.
Give her father ten thousand dollars, didnot you?
That ainot playin’ the game, I was right warm about that when Katie told me.
The girl’s fine, but her dad is no good.
What you done worried me last night so I couldnot sleep.
If I hear of your givin’ another cent away, make you return what’s left. right.
Now you govern yourself according.
I expected you to have some fun with that money, and to pass the fun along to me.
All got out of it, so far, is a bad night; and all you seem to have got out of it was an accident that nigh killed you.
If you donot do better, we’ll call off this hull arrangement.”
Whipple placated his uncle as best he could, but when he left the old fellow was still garrulous and peppery.
At half -past twelve, when he got back to Fordham, he found a gloomy gentleman in a Panama hat, a loud and expensive suit of clothes, and tan oxfords waiting for him.
The gentleman was Concho Charley Vandeever.
“Had some hard luck, Charley Whipple asked.
“Worst ever!” the other muttered, and began to pull money from every pocket of his clothes. it plumb queer how, whenever you want to lose, you’re bound to win?
A gang, headed by Monte, was aimin’ to trim you at one-call-two.
I told em you wasnot built for buckin’ the tiger, but that I was your next friend with a first lien on your bank account and that they could lead me to the slaughter.
Well, there was a killin’, believe me, but the inquest is now bein’ held on Threecard and his crowd.
I went in with a thousand dollars and come out with six thousand in cash and I for three thousand more.
Toughest run o’ luck I ever had.
Say, amigo, I jest couldnot lose.
Ever’ time there was a jack pot draw five and have a straight flush; ever’ time I held up a pair, get the two that went with it; and if I made a four-card draw, like enough find myself with a full house!
Gosh!”
Charley Van drew a pink silk handkerchief across his moist and wrinkled brow.
“Hanged if I understand it!” he mumbled.
“Serves you right for gambling,” said Whipple severely.
“If you expect to clean me out with the cards, Charley, you’ll find it isnot possible.
Now we’ve got just that much more to spend.”
“Well, donot throw it into me, pard,” begged Charley.
“Them I ainot worth a whoop, and got a way to get rid of my winnin’s and to make a fair-sized raid on your pile at the same time. be a man here in a leather coat at two o’clock. talk business with him.”
“Who is he, and what has he got?” a bird, and his name is Simmons, Percival Simmons; Perce Simmons, jest like that, or Persimmons for short. a flyer, and out at the park he’s got a three-seater aeroplane.
He come here to start a passenger-carryin’ service to Maricopa, or San Diego, or any old place, but no one seems fool enough to pay him a dollar a minute to get to somewhere they want to go. pretty near broke, and all he’s got is the machine.
How about travelin' to Los Angeles in style you reckon that would thrill Uncle Wes?”
“How much will it cost to travel by aeroplane to Los Angeles inquired Whipple.
“Well, I reckoned we'd buy the machine, and then give Simmons a hundred a day to run it for us. sell for sixteen thousand, spot cash. my six, and you'll have to put up only what you was fool enough to hand over to Mingo.
How does it strike you, More fun than a barrel o' monkeys to be had out of an aeroplane.
Always wanted to own one, but it didnot seem possible on forty a month and a dozen ways for even that. the matter with you?
Feelin' faint?'' Yes; Whipple was feeling very faint.
Buying an aeroplane had never occurred to him, possibly because the chance had not offered itself before.
But high places always made him dizzy.
Even when he climbed the gold mill to put a few shingles on the roof he became light-headed.
But he had his heart set on Los Angeles if Katie was going to be there and he and Charley might as well fly as travel in the steam cars.
“All right, Charley,” he said buy it.”
Charley Van let out a subdued whoop of joy.
“In this day of science and invention,” he remarked, “spendin' does come easy. be stepping some, as the man says.”
“Stepping from cloud to cloud,” added Whipple; wish to thunder, Charley, we had the hard ground under us.”
“Oh, it’ll be under us, returned the delighted cowboy “about two thousand feet down.”
A Friday forenoon Wesley Plunkett was in a most unhappy frame of mind.
Dyspepsia was now added to his other troubles, and he was trying a new medicine for it that cost him one dollar and fifty cents a bottle.
In addition to this cost for the medicine, he had been stung for some revenue stamps pasted on the carton which contained the bottle.
He could not get over those stamps; they struck at his heart and sent the bad-temper poison pulsing through his whole body.
He was in a mood to have a row with somebody, just on general principles.
At nine o'clock fate sent him a visitor and gave him his chance.
“Mr. Wesley Plunkett A voice with a rising inflection was wafted to him from the doorway leading out upon the second-story veranda.
It was a sharp, businesslike voice, but Uncle Wes did not look around. it to you he snapped.
“Clear out and leave me alone. a sick man and donot want to be bothered.”
He poured himself a teaspoonful of the new dyspepsia medicine and carefully lifted the spoon toward his lips.
The next moment the spoon was snatched out of his hand, and its valuable contents were scattered and lost on the Navajo blanket and the veranda floor.
Uncle Wes fell back in the canvas chair and glared.
He tried to say something particularly fierce, but his words hung in his throat.
A woman stood at his elbow.
She was a middle-aged woman, tall and muscular and mightily determined.
She wore tortoise-shell spectacles, and behind them her eyes seemed to glimmer balefully.
Her hat was a derby; and she had 'on a collar, necktie, and coat like a man's.
There was even something masculine about her skirt, and the common-sense shoes just below the hem of it.
She carried a small, square satchel, and her hands were large, and strong, seemingly very capable.
Now the only female who ever called on Uncle Wes was Katie Mingo.
Women, Uncle Wes had discovered early in life, were a source of extravagance and trouble.
So he had denied himself to them.
Even Katie calls were few and far between.
In his wrath and indignation he had been going to swear, but he held back the unseemly language.
“Now you’ve done it!” he rasped.
“All of a dime’s worth of my new dyspepsy dope gone to blazes.
Lady, you’d better hike, or maybe something’ll be said that wonot sound well. got to be ca’m and quiet in order to last three months.
Another shock like that you just gave me, and liable to flicker out and not go the limit.
You heard me; I said good morning.”
“Good morning, Mr. said the other easily, and put her satchel in a chair and opened it.
Uncle Wes saw that the interior of the satchel bore a faint resemblance to a bit of impedimenta Doc Flickinger carried, only this outfit was more extensive and in better condition.
Uncle Wes leaned forward restlessly.
His visitor was not leaving, but was making preparations to stay.
“Darn it,” he whooped, “what I meant was good-by The strength of his voice rather surprised him, that morning it was not as feeble as usual. the idee of your stickin around like this?”
The woman had been bending over the case.
She straightened erect with an object in her hand that had two rubber tubes hanging from it and writhing like a pair of black snakes.
Doctor Mixinger, of Prescott,” she replied calmly, “and here to find out what’s the matter with you.”
This was another shock to Uncle Wes.
He gasped and gripped the arms of his chair.
“You canot run in no rhinecaboo like this!” he cried wildly. know what’s the matter with me, and I wonot even pay you fifty dollars to make a guess.” let that trouble you, Mr. said Doctor Mixinger. already been paid the full fee; if I hadnot been, I shouldnot be here.
Now that I am here, I intend to do my professional duty.
I shall be pleasant about it, unless you make yourself disagreeable; in that event,” and here her features sharpened and her eyes gleamed, am going to be firm and transact our business just the same.”
She picked up the dangling tubes and pushed one into each of her ears.
“Who paid you?
Who sent you?”
Uncle Wes cringed as he demanded the information.
“Mr. Wesley Whipple.”
Uncle Wes went into a tantrum.
So that’s how Whipple was spending his money He would tell him things, next time he came to report.
“Say ‘ah-h-h,’ said Doctor Mixinger quietly, bending over him and pushing something against his heaving chest. wonot say a blamed thing but what’s on my mind barked Uncle Wes, rolling his eyes. donot want no lady doc fussin’ around me!
I wonot have any Doctor Mixinger straightened erect and fire flashed in her eyes. you call me a ‘lady doc/ she admonished; a lady, and a doctor, but draw the line at doc.’
Now calm yourself and say Here was a command, and it was spoken in such a tone that Uncle Wes said “ah-h-h” again and again, while all the time Doctor Mixinger pushed something over his chest, and half closed her eyes and listened; but, while he was saying “ah-h-h,” Uncle Wes was thinking in terms that were not pretty.
Finally the doctor smiled a quiet smile, pulled the rubber tubes out of her ears, and carefully replaced the stethoscope in the case. all, ainot it?” queried Uncle Wes eagerly.
“Not quite,” was the answer.
Doctor Mixinger pulled up a chair, seated herself, leaned forward, and looked him full in the eyes.
It was a probing look, and Uncle Wes felt a shiver going through him.
“Give me your left hand,” said the doctor.
“You ainot goin’ to hold my hand!
I never yit Uncle Wes yielded his left hand, and cringed again as the lady doctor’s soft, firm fingers caressed his bony wrist. mused the doctor, sitting back a moment later and studying the patient with a speculative stare.
Uncle Wes grabbed at his pipe and tobacco.
Savagely he filled the bowl and struck a match.
“How much longer you goin’ to stay he asked, as he surrounded himself with a fog of vapor.
“Just long enough to get you on your feet, so be patient.
Who has been looking after you?”
“Doc Flickinger.”
A faint smile showed at the corners of Doctor lips.
“What does he say?” she inquired.
“He gives me three months.
Next July fifteenth, sometime along in the afternoon, a goner.”
“What are those bottles on the table “All that keeps me alive,” returned Uncle Wes sharply.
“Does Doctor Flickinger prescribe that stuff for you?”
“Well, he says it's helpin’.”
“Helping to kill you.”
Doctor Mixinger got up, stepped to the table, and lifted the bottle containing the dyspepsia medicine.
She looked at the label, removed the cork, and smelled the contents then coolly, deliberately, she threw the bottle over the veranda rail, and it smashed to fragments on the ground below. the best place for that,” she observed calmly.
Uncle Wes went into a flurry.
He raged about the dollar and a half and the extra few cents for the stamps.
While he was raving, three other bottles went over' the rail.
He grabbed for the last one, but was not quick enough.
Utterly beside himself with rage, the old prospector jumped out of his chair and began prancing up and down the veranda; now and then he would pause and look over the railing and moan at the sight of the broken glass and wasted medicine.
“Say,” he quavered, “if I had a gun I surely would Doctor Mixinger drew a small, gleaming automatic pistol from one of her pockets.
“You havenot one handy she said.
“Well, I always make a practice of carrying one.
You see, I have to travel a good deal and meet all kinds of people.
Sit down, Mr.
The automatic was pointed carelessly in the general direction of Uncle Wes.
He grew quiet instantly and slumped into his chair again.
“How long have you been like this?” went on the doctor.
Uncle Wes moistened his lips with his tongue and tried twice before he could answer; then he managed to say: “Ten years.”
“Ten years lost,” murmured Doctor Mixinger, “and just when you ought to be in your prime.
Any appetite “Not a particle,” returned Uncle Wes, his fascinated eyes on the automatic which the doctor continued to hold in her hand.
“All I can eat for breakfast is about six slices o* bacon, a couple o’ slabs of bread, three or four eggs, and two cups o* coffee. every last thing my stomach’ll take in the morning. eat enough t® keep life in a chipmunk.”
“How about dinner and supper the doctor went on. do better at dinner, quite a little better. only jest a snack mebby a hunk o* cold roast, and a pot o’ tea, and two or three pieces o’ pie.
Last night I had cakes and sirup, and I never slept a wink. turrible bad off to-day, and now you’re makin’ me a lot worse. has sent you up to kill me,” he added accusingly.
“How much exercise do you take, Mr. donot dast exert myself too much, Doc Flickinger says.
If I was to try to walk around the block, drop in my tracks before I got halfway.
’Bout all I navigate is to the dinin’ room for breakfast, out here till dinner, then to the dinin’ room ag’in, then back here till supper, then the dinin’ room, then along about nine I totter off to bed.
All I can do to make it, sometimes.
Plumb shot to pieces, that’s the trouble with me.
I reckon you can see it, canot you “Get up, Mr. ordered Doctor Mixinger.
“You and I are going to take a walk around the block.
Never mind your shoes; those slippers will do.
You donot need a hat, either.
Come on.”
“No!” shouted Uncle Wes, horrified. aimin’ to lay me out cold. p’int that gun at me!
Go ’way, or call the police.
I canot “Come on Doctor eyes flashed, and she leveled the automatic.
Uncle Wes staggered to his feet.
With the doctor right behind him he reeled across the veranda and through the doorway into the hall.
“Brace up ordered the doctor.
“Throw your shoulders back, breathe deep. hang on to the banister as you go downstairs.
There, that’s right.
Now, then, keep step with me.”
Down on the sidewalk, the neighbors had a glimpse of Uncle Wes, hatless and in his old slippers, moving along at the side of Doctor Mixinger.
Josh Hopper stared after the two from his front steps.
He wagged his head forebodingly. killin’ him he said to himself reckon I might as well call the undertaker.
This is awful As Doctor Mixinger and Uncle Wes rounded the block, the doctor steadily increased the pace.
When they got back to front door Uncle Wes had to gallop to keep up; but he noticed, as he climbed the stairs and returned to the second-story veranda, that he was not breathing much faster than usual.
He was astounded.
“Well,” remarked the doctor, with a laugh, “you didnot drop, did you?
Mr. either Flickinger has scared you or you have scared yourself.
You havenot any more heart trouble than I have.
What you need, and all you need, is exercise physical and mental.
That is your proper tonic.
Forget your health, take on a hobby, or find some compelling purpose, and follow it with all the enthusiasm you can muster.
You must have an object in life that will make you think and stir around.”
“Then then I ainot goin’ to die in three months?” asked Uncle Wes, faint with wonder.
“You are going to die in about thirty years, providing you smoke less and stop dosing yourself with those patent nostrums.
You are perfectly sound and that is quite remarkable, considering the way you have coddled yourself for ten years.
I never saw a man of your age who was potentially more capable of getting the utmost out of life.
But cut loose and be active.
This is a bright and happy world, and you are perfectly competent to get your full share of the brightness and happiness.”
While talking, the doctor had been closing the little square case.
Straightening, she turned and held out her hand in a friendly way. was paid five hundred dollars to come here and tell you this,” she continued, “and you ought to be grateful to your nephew, for it is the best advice you have ever had.
I beg your pardon for displaying the pistol, but I think you’ll admit that you were a difficult case and hard to handle.
I trust there are no hard feelings.
Uncle Wes took the offered hand; then, startled by the great truth that had suddenly dawned upon him, he .watched wide-eyed while Doctor Mixinger vanished through the doorway.
“Ten o’ my best years plumb wasted he muttered, kicking over the canvas chair.
“Run around that block without so much as ketchin’ my breath Nothin’ the matter, not a thing, except the want of exercise!
I He broke off abruptly as his eyes, happening to cross the veranda railing, encountered Doc Flickinger moving on the boarding house from up the street.
Flickinger was coming to make his customary morning call on Uncle Wes.
The eyes of the old prospector narrowed, and his face grew hard. the cimiroon that done more to make me waste them ten years than any one else on earth he growled. reckon due for a little more exercise,” he finished, and crouched beside the door leading to the second-story veranda.
A A of shocks that jarred the boarding house from underpinning to roof lifted Josh Hopper out of his chair and carried him at a double quick to the second floor of his establishment.
Mrs. Hopper, and Pedro, the man of all work, joined him as he raced.
When the three of them arrived on the upper veranda, what they saw made them almost doubt the evidence of their senses.
Uncle Wes, the confirmed invalid, had Doc Flickinger flat on the porch floor, and was pinning him there with two knees on his chest.
In a fury, Uncle Wes was bumping head on the hard boards while Flickinger begged for mercy.
“Yes,” roared Uncle Wes; feelin’ quite well this morning, doc.
No; this exercise ainot hurtin’ my heart a particle, but seems to be right soothin'.
I reckon you neednot call any more.
You see, made up my mind to live thirty years instead of jest three months. convalescin’ fast. you glad to see how recuperatin' under your treatment you Mr. and Mrs. Hopper and Pedro flung at him and, with their united efforts, managed to heave him clear of the prostrate Flickinger.
The latter, bounding to his feet, fled for the stairs, the street, and safety.
He left his hat, spectacles, and his medicine case behind.
Uncle Wes flung them after him over the railing, and the medicine case jingled merrily as it struck the ground.
“What on earth is the matter wailed Mrs. Hopper hysterically.
Uncle Wes leaped into the air and let off a whoop. a well man, that’s what’s the matter!” he declared. come to, and got wise to how Flickinger was stringin' me along.
That lady doc doctor sort of opened my eyes.
She made me do things that Flickinger said I couldnot do without passin’ out.
Oh, my gorry, what a fool been!
You can have your second-story porch, Hopper; done with it.”
He ran to his room, kicked off his slippers, and began putting on a pair of shoes.
Then he got into clothes which he had made it a practice to wear only on Sundays.
He had a compelling object in mind.
Now that he was a healthy man with thirty good years ahead of him, he realized his mistake in giving the hundred thousand dollars to his nephew.
His business was to overhaul and recover as much of the money as possible.
Dinner was ready by the time Uncle Wes was ready for the street, but delaying to eat while was spending with an open hand was out of the question.
Uncle Wes reasoned that the faster he hurried the more of his good money he would recover.
The sight of Wesley Plunkett traveling at speed along the streets of Phoenix, caused the old-timers to rub their eyes and wonder if they were “seeing things.”
It was ten years since anything like that had happened before.
It was an incredible performance for one whose days were said to be numbered.
“Must be flighty,” was the general comment; “he ought to be captured and taken back to But no one tried to capture him.
There was a look in the old prospector’s face that warned against interference.
He came to the Hotel Fordham, dashed through the street entrance, and ran to the counter behind which Felix Vannell stood and blinked. my nephew, demanded Uncle Wes.
“Tell him here and want him pronto.
Get a move on, young feller, because this is mighty important.” left here bright and early this morning, Mr. replied the clerk.
Uncle Wes dropped his elbows on the desk and bowed his tall form across it. he go?” he barked.
“Him and Charley Vandeever started for Los Angeles, where the chances for spending money in a big way are a lot better than they are here.”
This was a terrible wrench for Uncle Wes.
He stifled a groan.
Physically there had been a change in him, a complete transformation, but mentally he was the same old tightwad.
The thought that had already escaped and was on his way to a big and extravagant city, where the rest of the hundred thousand would melt away like dew in the morning sun, was a blow between the eyes.
Uncle Wes came out of his daze to inquire: “Wh what train did he take?
I can overhaul him with a telegram.
Hurry What train did he leave on?
And what’s he doing with Charley Vandeever think he called in Vandeever to help him get rid of his money and they didnot leave by train.
They bought one of these aeroplanes for sixteen thousand dollars and hired the chap that owned it to take them to Los Angeles. paying that pilot a hundred dollars a day. you see the papers this morning? full of it.”
Uncle Wes groaned again.
He staggered.
Then he thought of the bank in which had deposited the money.
On a forlorn chance he went there and instituted inquiries.
He was informed by the cashier that Whipple had drawn out all the money in his account, taking it in thousand-dollar bills.
When he left the bank, Uncle Wes felt like a beaten man.
He had his health, and he had a lot of money left, but it hurt him to the soul to see the remains of that hundred thousand dollars getting away from him.
Back at he made his plans to go to Los Angeles by train, and be there to meet and Vandeever when they arrived.
Hopper, however, explained to him that the aeroplane traveled so fast that it would probably be in Los Angeles before Uncle Wes could get a train out of Phoenix.
Uncle Wes suddenly had an idea.
‘Til send a telegram to the chief of police in Los Angeles,” he said, “and have and Vandeever arrested the minute they come down. stop ’em.
They wonot be able to spend any money if they’re in jail.
Jest as soon as I learn they’ve been arrested, go to Los Angeles myself, get back what’s left of my money, and tell the police to turn ’em loose.”
He went to the courthouse and talked with the sheriff; then the sheriff got busy and wired the Los Angeles police department.
Following this there was a period of waiting.
Feeling that he had made an excellent move, Uncle Wes grew calm.
He read the papers, and learned how accompanied by the irrepressible Charley Vandeever, had bought the aeroplane, hired the pilot, and taken flight from the city park.
This sensation divided honors, in the daily press, with a big bank robbery at Eudora, Arizona, in which three bandits had made a daylight raid and escaped with sixty thousand dollars in cash and Liberty Bonds.
The bank was offering five thousand dollars for the capture of the robbers, and ten per cent of all cash and bonds recovered.
This affair interested Uncle Wes only because it claimed the attention of the local sheriff, and gave him less time to devote to and Vandeever.
Uncle Wes haunted the sheriff’s office, waiting for news of the arrest of his nephew and Vandeever, and made himself a nuisance.
One day, two days, passed and still the aeroplane had not reached Los Angeles; nor had it reached any other known port of call, east or west, north or south.
A deep, dark mystery had suddenly fallen over that aeroplane.
After leaving Phoenix it had neither been sighted nor heard of.
Probably, the opinion ran, it had been wrecked somewhere on the deserts or in the mountains and would never be heard of again.
Then, on the third day after the flying machine had left Phoenix, among the suspicious characters brought in by the sheriff and his posse to be questioned regarding the Eudora robbery, was a weazel-faced known to be a side partner of the gambler, Threecard Monte.
He told a story, after a session of the third degree, that let in a flood of light on the spenders bound for Los Angeles.
Monte, it seemed, had subsidized the pilot of the aeroplane and won his consent to land his passengers on Saddleback Flats at the edge of the Estrella Mountains.
This was a lonely hole in the hills, inhabited solely by scorpions, tarantulas, and sidewinders.
But the gambler and some of his friends would be at Saddleback Flats, if not when the aeroplane arrived at least shortly thereafter, and their plans were to annex every dollar carried by and Vandeever by fair means or foul.
The discovery that Monte and his confederates had left by fast automobile in the general direction of Saddleback Flats, the very morning the aeroplane had hopped off, corroborated the story told by the informer.
Deputy sheriffs started at once for Saddleback Flats.
They refused to let Uncle Wes ride in their car, but his enthusiasm for an active role in recovering his money spurred him to hire a flivver and follow on to the Flats.
Galusha Mingo went with him; and, although it was manifestly no work for a woman, Katie Mingo insisted on going with her father.
Katie was wild with apprehension over and Uncle Wes had not the heart to insist that she stay at home, especially since Mingo was bearing rather more than his share of the flivver's hire.
This second party got away three hours after the deputy sheriffs had started. all be too late," hazarded Galusha Mingo gloomily.
“More than likely, Monte and his gang have got the money and are in parts unknown by this time." had a lesson," mourned Uncle Wes; hang on to my money, after this, and not fool it away on a spendthrift nephew."
“But, oh, what do you suppose has happened to wailed Katie. fret about him, Katie," said Uncle Wes, with whom girl was a prime favorite be back in gold mill, before many days, working for thirty a week, as usual. a after all's said and done, and nobody ever yet made him hard to find." aeroplane had been named by Percival Simmons the Ace High and since a hand in a poker game with nothing but ace high seldom wins, Simmons' name for his flyer was not much of a recommendation.
Neither Whipple nor Vandeever, however, drew their speculations out so fine.
The former paid ten thousand, and the latter six thousand, and when the Ace High hopped off at Phoenix that bright Friday morning it was their property and the former owner was on their pay roll at one hundred dollars a day.
Whipple had turned the balance of his bank account into cash, and he had with him, on taking the air in his flying start for Los Angeles, seventy-five bills and a hundred plus in small change.
It was enough, certainly, to finance a tolerable round of pleasure for two wandering spendthrifts.
The three passengers were distributed in separate cockpits along the backbone of the Ace High Simmons in front, just back of the propeller, then Whipple, and then Vandeever.
Just before the take-off, Whipple had overheard Simmons making inquiries about the Estrella Mountains and Saddleback Flats.
This struck him as queer, and he had asked the pilot why he was so interested in that particular part of the country.
Simmons answered that he merely wanted to use the mountains and the flats as a landmark while conning his course.
Whipple was surprised to discover, as soon as they were in the air, that he was not in the least dizzy.
There was a deafening clamor in his ears.
This was continuous and made conversation impossible.
And when he got out from behind his wind shield to look overside, a frightful rush of wind tore the breath out of his lungs.
But there were no unpleasant sensations, and all his doubts about the aeroplane being a good “buy" were dissipated.
Thirty minutes after the start, a sunbaked wilderness, destitute of human life, was unrolling beneath the Ace High at the rate of a hundred miles an hour.
Whipple knew that a mountainous country lay below, but viewed from overhead it seemed flat, and every highflung butte and peak had no more visible elevation than a cactus clump.
Simmons kept constant watch, presumably looking for landmarks.
Why this was necessary, at that stage of the journey, was incomprehensible to Whipple.
A compass course due west was all that was needed.
The pilot, theless, seemed anxious and worried, and at last confused.
He dipped lower, in order to get a clearer view of the country; and then he lifted higher, circled, and cut figure eights miles long, twisting and turning and falling and rising until Whipple lost all sense of direction and could only judge the way they were traveling by taking a slant at the sun.
Charley Van was likewise puzzled by these maneuvers.
He leaned over to yell something in ear.
After several attempts he made it manifest to Whipple that he did not like the proceedings, and that they were losing time with all those curlicues when they ought to be whooping it up on a straightaway course; and wouldnot just yell that into Simmons' ear, order him to point for Los Angeles, keep going, and oblige.
Whipple leaned over his wind shield and shouted at the aviator’s helmeted head the joint objections of the two owners of the machine to the man they had hired to run it.
Simmons answered something, but Whipple could not understand what it was.
With one hand on Simmons’ leather-clad shoulder, with the other Whipple indicated a westerly direction.
The pilot nodded, nosed the machine skyward, and started again on the proper course.
For ten minutes everything went beautifully; and then, all at once, the terrific din of the propeller failed in a swift diminuendo.
Presently, only the screech of the wind could be heard among the taut wires and stays.
There could be talk now that was clearly heard. the idee, Simmons?" demanded Charley Van.
“Engine trouble of some kind," answered the pilot, his hands passing swiftly over the controls; dead, and I canot get a kick out of it.”
“Then what?" inquired Whipple, with a sinking sensation. got to volplane down.
Look for a place to land, both of you.
If we canot find the right kind of a place, we're all done for."
This was pleasant news!
The Ace High was corkscrewing downward in wide circles, and the ground below seemed to be jumping up at it, greedy for a collision.
With wide, fearful eyes Whipple and Vandeever were trying to discover a level stretch of ground among the tumbled mountain peaks.
“Can you see anything of Saddleback Flats?" yelled Simmons wildly. miles to the west of them flats Charley Van roared at him.
“The country down there looks to me a heap more like the Gila Bend Divide than the Estrellas.
Oh, by glory Sim, you've sure got me all mixed up.
Hit the flat desert, canot you “We canot hit anything but those peaks,” was the pilot's answer; you see anything that looks level and smooth, down there?
Use your eyes!"
With sickening rapidity the saw-tooth crests of the hills leaped at the Ace High a canon cried Whipple, as the flying machine cut across the yawning mountain chasm at perhaps five hundred feet.
“And a flat at the bottom of it!" added Vandeever.
“Can you drop into that gash and 'light on the flat?" got to,” answered Simmons, between his set teeth; “if I donot it's all over but payin' the bets."
He manipulated the falling machine in such fashion that the nose of it was brought in line with the north and south trend of the canon; then, straightening out, the plane rushed downward.
They cleared the two steep walls of the gash and, by a turn to the left, hit the flat with a shock that almost threw Whipple and Vandeever out of their cockpits.
The flyer lurched and wabbled over the rough ground, finally halting with a crash.
Whipple took a header into the air, landed on one of the wings, rolled down the steep slope of it, and off the end in a six-foot fall on a nest of bowlders.
There he curled up quietly and went to sleep.
He awoke to find Charley Van throwing water in his face.
“How you feelin', inquired the cowboy anxiously. good deal like I did when the street car hit me," answered Whipple in a faint voice. waste all that good water, Charley give me a drink.”
Vandeever limped away, bent down over a small stream, refilled his Stetson, and came back. this fierce?” he commented gloomily, as Whipple gulped the water over the hat’s brim. reckon this deal was a mistake, Simmons?” asked Whipple.
“Who cares a hoot about Sim?” snapped Vandeever.
“He sold us a sky boat with a bum engine, and now see what’s happened.
I allow if he broke his neck we wouldnot be much more’n even.”
“No such luck,” came the melancholy voice of the pilot.
He was sitting on a bowlder, minus his helmet and leather jacket, and was knotting a handkerchief around his left forearm, using his right hand and his teeth.
Whipple had been dragged clear of the rock pile, and he now sat up and took a look around.
He was at the edge of a flat, and the flat was at the bend of the canon.
The walls of the defile were high and straight up and dow merely smooth precipices.
A small stream babbled over the rocks of its narrow course, and in the sandy stretches were rank growths of mesquite.
The Ace High had run head on into the canon’s east wall.
The lefthand planes had been crumpled up by a big cottonwood tree, and the front end of the machine had been crushed as far back as the pilot's cockpit.
Simmons surely had been lucky to escape alive.
“Think you can fix up the old catamaran, Sim?” inquired Vandeever.
“Not hardly,” was the sarcastic response; a total wreck.
Landing gear all smashed, propeller all in pieces, port planes in smithereens, and engine knocked into a cocked hat.
When we get away from here we’ll have to walk.”
“Walk!” yelled the exasperated Vandeever.
“Do you know what sort of country lies between us and civilization ’Bout 'steen hundred miles of desolation, with nothin’ to feed on but chuckwallas and nothin’ to drink but the juice of niggerhead cactus.
Walk!
Man, we never could make it.
If your old pop bottle had to give out, why didnot it pull the play within hailin’ distance of Phoenix? an elegant mess o’ fish!”
Whipple got up and balanced himself dizzily on his legs. look around and get our bearings,” he suggested. somethin’ to do, anyways,” Vandeever assented.
They moved northward toward the upper end of the canon.
Simmons did not go with them, but sat disconsolately on his bowlder and began spiritlessly to manufacture a cigarette.
“He donot need to worry a hull lot,” remarked Vandeever got his sixteen thousand, so bustin’ up the Ace High donot mean a thing in his young life.
It didnot take us long to get rid o’ that bunch o’ money, anyways.
Plumb wasted, and nothin’ to show for it. this is a right discouragin’ canon, if anybody asks you.
Look at them walls A hundred feet straight up, and even a squirrel couldnot get from here to the rim rock.
And there’s the north end it is just like the side walls.
I move we take a look over south.”
The north end of the canon was closed by a sheer precipice.
The little stream, hitting the wall, sank out of sight under it, flowing through a subterranean channel.
“Wait a minute,” called Whipple, halting his companion who was about to turn back. this?”
On the smooth surface of the end wall some hand had rudely inscribed with red pigment: “Lost Creek Canon.
No chance to get out.
Bottled up.
Johnson Blue.”
Vandeever read the inscription, gave a howl of despair, and threw up his hands.
“Lost Creek Canon By glory, that does settle it! we’re planted for keeps.”
“What do you mean, Charley?”
Whipple asked. you never heard tell of Johnson Blue over to the no one ever mentioned Lost Creek Canon around mine “Not that I remember.”
“Say, listen.
This here is a pocket there ainot no gettin’ out of.
Once here you’re here to stay.
Only it’s as hard to get into as it is to get out of, mostly.
Johnson Blue got into it with ropes, explorin’ like, and the ropes got loose and come down on him.
A carrier pigeon he had with him got back to Prescott with the news, but the message was weather-beaten and dim in spots.
The location of Lost Creek Canon wasnot readable, and people hunted for it for months, hopin’ to save Blue.
But he wasnot never saved.
I reckon, if we look, we’ll find what’s left o' him around here some’rs.”
Vandeever took off his hat and slammed it down on the rocks; then he leaned against the sheer wall and laughed huskily and mirthlessly.
“And here’s you and me,” he went on, “loaded to the brim with dinero and aimin' to cut loose with it in Los Angeles, bottled up in Lost Creek Canon, without no carrier pigeon or ropes or nothin'. jest plumb cast away, that’s all and when we’re laid out cold, the birds'll get them thousand-dollar bills and line their nests with 'em.”
He laughed again, and the walls of the canon gave back the nerve-wracking echoes.
A north end of Lost Creek Canon was cheerless, forlorn, and offered a despairing prospect; but a “find” was made around the bend in the south end that put heart in the three castaways.
The walls here were steep and unscalable, and a lofty barrier thrown across the defile made of it a complete cul-de-sac.
Here Lost Creek found itself, bubbling up from beneath the foot of the barrier, flowing the length of the canon, and losing itself again at the other end of that tremendous blind alley.
The surroundings south of the bend were not so depressing.
The walls were hung with trailing vines, which gave a bowerlike aspect to that part of the mountain prison; and there was a flat covered with a thick growth of oaks and pinons; and in the heart of this grove Whipple and Vandeever stumbled upon their big surprise a small but comfortable log cabin.
That cabin could not have been built by Johnson Blue, discoverer and original castaway of Lost Creek Canon.
It was seven years, according to Vandeever, since homing pigeon had fluttered into Prescott, and the cabin was plainly of very recent construction.
It stood empty and deserted, and there was no path leading to its door.
The door was not secured in any way, but opened readily to hand.
The single room within was marvelously equipped for comfort.
Three bunks furnished with blankets and pillows were built against the walls.
Three chairs stood around a small table; and in a cupboard, plates, cups and saucers, knives, forks, and spoons continued to carry out this remarkable grouping of threes.
Charley Van pulled off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Looks like somebody had been gettin' ready for our party,” was his comment. this jest nacherly rattle your spurs, In a second cupboard was found a bag of flour, strips of hacon, a box of potatoes, and a generous supply of canned goods.
There was a stove, too, in one corner of the room, with pots and pans hanging all around it, and even a supply of firewood piled beside it.
Charley Van collapsed into one of the chairs. once, say, that our cup was and caught a little good luck when it rained trouble. we didnot outfit ourselves with so much as a ham sandwich when makin’ that start for Los Angeles in the sky-hooter; so if Mrs. Class Luck hadnot dropped this cabin and contents down in the canon for us, we’d sure have starved plumb to death. so new the worms havenot even got in the prunes.
We can draw out the agony for quite a spell, figgerin'.”
“Charley,” returned Whipple, “this pocket in the hills isnot so blamed inaccessible as you have been trying to make me believe.
Somebody came here and fixed up this place, calculating to make a home out of it” seen for yourself, Vandeever returned, “that there ainot no gettin' out of here unless we sprout wings. admit that hombres could come down on a rope, same as Johnson Blue done, but without that same rope gettin' out is goin' to bother a heap."
“Three men built this cabin and got it ready to live in," Whipple went on; “and that wasnot so long ago, because everything is fresh and new.
They must be planning to come back here very soon.
Well, Charley, when they come, we'll use their means for getting into the canon to get out of it.
All we have to do is to wait." exclaimed Vandeever. hoping toe get our chance to pull out before your thirty days are up and you are left stranded with that bundle of kale. have to spend faster than I reckoned on when we do hit Los Angeles.
Now, bein' hungry and the like o' that, how about gettin’ Simmons over here?
He was braggin’ about how he can cook.
Suppose we start him in?"
“All right; go get him."
Vandeever found Simmons still sitting on his bowlder, very much cast down. you forget," were his first words to Vandeever, “that still drawing my hundred a day." a mere baggytelle, Perce," returned the cowboy; “was you stringin’ us when you said you could cook?" a regular chef," boasted Simmons “and I was sitting here thinking how I could eat if there was only anything eatable in sight."
“Well, chirk up we're goin’ to feed.
Come on and show you."
When the cabin and its supplies burst on his vision the aviator was astounded.
Whipple was building a fire in the stove, but Vandeever pulled him away from the work.
“Sim tells me that he expects us to pay him the hundred a day, whether we're flyin’ or laid up in this canon," said Vandeever.
“By doin’ the cookin'* and taking care of the ranch I calculate that he’ll make all of five dollars a day, anyways, so I move we let him do it You and me, will jest sit around and fret because the spendin’ is so poor.
Get busy, Sim Among the supplies were two or three dozen packages of cigarettes, several pounds of smoking tobacco, and half a dozen decks of cards.
Vandeever made these discoveries and announced them joyfully. he whispered to his friend, “with my luck at the pasteboards, it’ll be blamed little of that hundred a day ever see."
Simmons proved that he was really a capable cook by preparing an excellent meal.
All were in better spirits after they had eaten their dinner.
While Simmons was clearing away the empty dishes, Vandeever tumbled into one of the bunks for a nap, and Whipple roamed around the flat.
It seemed to Whipple as though there must be some way into that canon and out of it.
The stories about Johnson imprisonment in that mountain pocket might be far-fetched.
Whipple was not so credulous as Vandeever seemed to be, so he went hunting for a possible avenue of escape.
He failed to find it.
The walls, masked with trailing vines, were as precipitous as the bare rock faces in other parts of the canon.
Whipple wondered if the vines were strong enough to bear his weight.
He learned that they were not; for, essaying a climb by means of the festooned creepers, he sustained a fall of a dozen feet and gave up his attempts.
As he moved around the edge of the flat his foot kicked against something, and he stooped and picked up a small tin box.
The box was scarred and worn, and locked.
He broke it open.
Inside of it was an open-face silver watch, with a leather fob and an elk’s tooth charm attached to it, eighteen cents in change, a comb and brush, a pocket knife, and a memorandum book.
Sitting down at the foot of an oak he fell to examining the various objects.
On the back of the watch was the monogram, The same initials were engraved on the handle of the knife.
“Relics of Johnson Blue,” thought Whipple, and picked up the little book.
On the flyleaf he read this, written in a firm, businesslike hand: Johnson Blue, late of New York City, now of Nowhere in Particular: His impressions of life, based on the way in which he lived it, and written for his own amusement while he slowly starved to death.
This was gruesome, but it held a fascination for Whipple.
Blue really had been bottled up in that canon.
He had sent out his carrier pigeon, hoping for rescue.
Rescue had not come, and famine had claimed him for a victim.
“What you got, This was Vandeever.
Having finished his nap he had gone searching for Whipple.
The latter told him what he had found, and how he had chanced upon it.
“By glory the cowboy exclaimed, sitting down at his friend’s side and looking with deep interest at the watch, the knife, the military hair brush, and the comb.
“Eighteen cents!
He was mighty nigh busted flat, wasnot he?”
Whipple read from the flyleaf of the book.
“Purty tough commented Vandeever, with feeling.
“And we might have starved allee same as Blue if somebody hadnot built that cabin for us and filled it with supplies.
Poor old Blue!
He must ’a’ been blue them last days.
I canot imagine nothin’ worse than havin’ hunger get you.
Read about them impressions of his, Whipple began to read “No help has arrived, and I have come to the conviction that the carrier pigeon failed to reach Prescott.
That means that my days are numbered.
The chuckwallas are not very plenty, and not very appetizing.
In the heyday of my wastrel year, I remember how squab on toast, chicken a la Maryland, and roast canvasback duck palled on my jaded appetite.

“But why repine?
I have had my fling, and here I am holed away among the bleak mountains with my large fortune dwindled to a pitiful eighteen cents a good exhibit in the case of Gal Life versus A Sensible Existence; I am a horrible example in the matter of what not to do with a million dollars; and I feel the urge to put some of my philosophy down with pen and ink.

And I have an idea that I can make my finish the finest things I have done in all my riotous year.”
“Gosh!” exclaimed Vandeever, as Whipple paused reflectively.
“Now whyever do you suppose he was writin’ like that, read on,” answered Whipple, “and see if we can find out.” was a happy man before my Uncle Ezra died and left me that million dollars in hard cash.

“Back in the old days, though, I was happy.

Work was for those poor fish who had no uncle to die and leave them a million.
I started out to put some new brightness in the Gay White Way.

I had friends everywhere, and they did their best to make me forget I had ever been a bookkeeper.
“Is it much of a trick to run through a million in a year?
Not in a town like New York, wet or dry.
When a man who, now and then, has to walk to save car fare, wakes up with a million in his mitt, maybe he’ll still walk to save car fare but I doubt it.

“Now that we got our pockets full o’ money, I ainot in any mood to listen to such stuff.
I hadnot a notion Blue was that kind of a ciiniroon.”
“Looks like he was hitting at us, eh, Charley queried Whipple. tell a man And it ainot a fair go, either.
Why inmlazes did you have to kick that tin box out o’ the brush, But Blue wasnot the same as you. in your uncle’s contract that you got to spend.
Blue wasnot obliged to do what he done.
He was goin’ on his own when he got down to them eighteen cents. some people plumb foolish?”
Whipple and Vandeever, at the foot of the oak in Lost Creek Canon, sat brooding in deep thought over the foolishness of Johnson Blue.
What angle was taken by their vagrant thoughts is no matter but presently the cowboy got up, walked sheepishly over to the little book, and picked it up and dusted it off.
“Take care of it. he said, handing the. melancholy record to his friend.
“Like enough, after all, you and me will get eighteen cents’ worth o’ fun out o’ readin’ it.
If he goes into his spendin’ habits, maybe there’ll be a tip for us when we get to Los. have to work fast if we’re held up here for much of a spell.”
A little book of Johnson wielded an uncanny influence.
Two days after it had been found all three young men in the canon had come under its mystic spell.
When Whipple was not reading it aloud to his companions, either Vandeever or Simmons was sure to have it and to be deeply immersed in its contents.
The sorry chronicle was less than five thousand words in length.
In giving so much time to it, therefore, the castaways were continually rereading parts of the manuscript.
Each had his favorite passages; and Whipple, curious to know just what appealed most to Vandeever and Simmons, took up the little book as each laid it down.
In case, his clews were various leaves bent at the corners and, in Simmons’, a pencil checking of sundry paragraphs.
It developed that the cowboy’s interest was held by ingenious methods of extravagance.
He would charter a sumptuous private train, for instance, and take a large party of friends to some prize fight in the Middle West; or he would buy a private yacht, spend a riotous month in the West Indies, and then sell the yacht for less than half what he had paid for it.
He would give dinners to boon companions, at which diamond and platinum stick pins were passed around as favors.
Once, in Florida, he had rented an entire hotel for a week, living in it in lonely grandeur with every employee at his beck and nod.
An extravagant eccentricity was never to wear the same suit of clothes twice, but give away each suit when it was taken off.
Simmons’ marked passages consisted largely of philosophical deductions. false friend is one who shares your bounty, battens on your favors, and then fails to recognize you when your money is gone.
He is a deceiver and a thief.”
And this crook is the physical manifestation of a crooked soul, warped by greed and a hunger for easy money.
Better that a man should have a millstone hung about his neck and be flung into the sea than to profit in such a way.”
And again: “Not money, but the love of money, is the root of all evil.
Because of this we betray a trust and land in jail, or we commit murder and hang.
One who loves money for itself is capable of any atrocity.”
Whipple, on his own part, was entranced with the whole tragic story, but his pet paragraphs were some of platitudes, such as: “Waste not, want not,” and “Be careful with what you earn, and doubly careful with what is given you and “Stand on your own feet; he beholden to no man for so much as a nickel;” and “Spend wisely, but save with even more wisdom; for a tightwad is anathema and a wastrel is a lost soul and, lastly, this priceless ruby in the casket of diamonds: “Be not lured by relatives or friends or strangers into ways of wasteful extravagance for an act repeated becomes habit, and habit becomes second nature, and second nature becomes character, and character makes us what we are for better or for worse.”
All this, to some minds, would have been a mere collection of rubbish.
It is quite possible to understand why the last writings of Johnson Blue might appeal to Whipple, and why a cowboy, eager to master all the fine arts of getting rid of money, might be interested in them, but that Percival Simmons should ponder such passages as he had marked was an incomprehensible mystery.
Johnson Blue, with just money enough left to get him to some corner of the country, had come to Prescott.
Like Timon of Athens he yearned for some desert place where he could forget the ingratitude of those whom he had believed to be friends and kill all thoughts of the girl Ethel who had married a better man.
So he bought a burro, a grub stake, several hundred feet of rope, a homing pigeon in a wicker cage, and set out for the heart of the hills.
His idea was to immure himself on an island in the air, a supposedly unscalable mesa called Encan tada that had come to be a legend in the Southwest.
His purpose was to get away by himself, burn all his bridges, and even cast off the ropes by which he had hoped to gain the mesa's top.
Then, if he tired of his hermitlike existence, he would send word back to Prescott by means of the carrier pigeon, and some one would come and effect his rescue.
It was a wild fancy.
He failed to find Mesa Encantada, but he did happen upon a pocket in the ground as difficult of access as any island in the air.
With his ropes he managed to get into it, but the ropes loosened and came down on him before he had lowered the remainder of his supplies into the canon.
Weeks later, his half -starved burro wandered into Wickenburg; this, however, was long after the carrier pigeon had made its home port with a damaged message that told of plight, but failed to define his exact whereabouts.
So, from last writings and information given by Vandeever, Whipple pieced the story together.
Somehow, the thrill of it grew on him as the days passed.
It seemed to grow on the cowboy and the aviator as well.
Knotty problems offered themselves to the castaways.
Were they destined to reach the end of their provisions and come to a wretched end, there in Lost Creek Canon, as Blue had done?
Who had built and furnished that cabin on the flat with supplies for three?
On the answer to this second question hung their hopes of deliverance.
A week passed, however, without bringing the owners of the cabin.
Vandeever, for once in his life at least, had something more than his Stetson on his mind.
“By glory,” he complained, lost a hull week, here in this hole in the hills, waitin’ for some one to come. got to stop coolin’ our heels, and try to find a way out.
Grub is goin’ fast, and I move we meander around and try to find them ropes of Maybe they havenot rotted clean to pieces, and we can use ’em in gettin’ clear o’ this blamed pocket.”
So they went hunting for the ropes.
But they had vanished completely.
When absolutely certain that they were not to be found, further attempts were made to climb the wall by means of the hanging vines.
The vines were fragile, and after Vandeever had taken a bad tumble the maneuver was given up as hopeless.
Simmons raided the wreck of the Ace High and removed and spliced to34 gether a number of guy wires.
The resulting cable proved too stiff and unwieldy and nothing could be done with it.
In desperation, another forlorn search for the ropes was begun.
It was while this was going on that Simmons, creeping along at the edge of the flat under a festoon of trailing vines, found a small wicker cage with its door unlatched.
This recalled Blue to the minds of the castaways.
Here, undoubtedly, was the very cage in which he had kept his carrier pigeon.
Vandeever, fired with a sudden thought, dropped to his knees and continued investigations at that part of the foot of the cliff.
He crept through the vines, was lost to sight for five minutes, and at last emerged into view with a white face and wild eyes. touched ’em,” he gasped, drawing his sleeve across his wet forehead, “and they they rattled.
Oh, my glory!”
“What rattled?” demanded Whipple.
“Bones in there Blue, what's left o' him.
Never had such a start in my hull life, layin' under a bit of an overhang, and he grinned up at me all white and and well,” he finished, jest had to have air.
Blue is jest a pile o' bones in a khaki suit.
Say,” muttered Vandeever, it give you a start, “Sure,” answered Whipple, “but we’ve got a duty to do, Charley. a great little book he wrote, and the least we can do is to bury these bones away in the pleasantest part of the flat.
Look his fountain pen.
I want it for my own, this and the eighteen cents.
You can take the watch and knife, and Simmons can have the fob and the elk-tooth charm.”
“Who gets the book?” draw cuts for that.
Get Simmons now. got to do the best we can, Charley.”
The three men got to work, and in a short time all that remained of Johnson Blue had been decently interred, to the best of their ability.
Poor Johnson Blue!
For one brief year everything he had wanted had been his.
Now there he lay, and of what use to him were all the millions in the world Whipple sat down.
“Everything has been said that can be said, I take it,” he remarked, “about a fool and his money.
Now and then, at the bitter end, a fool wakes up and says, or writes, a number of wise things.
And we three would be fools if we did not profit by them.
If we ever get out of this canon, Charley, I make a solemn vow to give back to Uncle Wes the rest of his money. going to tell him that not fitted for the job he set for me.”
“Then then you ainot goin’ to Los Angeles at all?” inquired Vandeever plaintively. going back to the Mine to work in the gold mill.”
“Then me for the ranch, if that’s how you stack up,” said Vandeever. got mucho plenty of this canon and that book of His writing’s have plumb robbed me of all the pleasure I might have had helpin’ you spend your uncle's money.
I reckon the boys will gi'me the laugh, but they canot sing that old chantey about the Wad that Wilted because it wonot stick.”
Simmons was having a struggle with himself.
At last he managed to get the better of his feelings and observed, in a strained, unnatural voice got something to say, men.
Monte hired me to drop you on Saddleback Flats.
He and two of his pals were to be waiting there and corral the kale you two had with you.
I was to have a share in it.
But I missed Saddleback Flats, somehow In two jumps Vandeever was in front of Simmons. had a notion more’n once you was playin' crooked he yelled.
“Now, then, you two-faced sidewinder, right here’s where I beat you up Whipple hastened to step between them.
“No,” he said sternly; “hands off of Simmons, Charley.
He didnot make anything by his treachery; and here, where we’ve put away Johnson Blue, let’s bury our animosity along with some of our fool ideas.”
Vandeever was red and wrathful.
Not ordinarily could he have been halted, in such a manner, by the restraining hand of a friend; but there was a spirit of peace abroad in the canon at that moment the spirit of Johnson Blue.
“All right, Simmons," said Vandeever to the aviator, “you ainot the only one in this bunch that made a stumble.
You must not At that instant, Whipple leaped at Vandeever and Simmons and pulled them down.
He was excited, and a wild light gleamed jn his eyes.
“Look!" he whispered, pointing toward the vine-clad wall. coming!
The men who built and stocked that cabin are here!
Watch!" descending sun, slanting over the western rim of the canon, brightened the eastern wall.
The brightness was rising toward the top of the wall, leaving the foot of the cliff in shadowy twilight.
Some thirty or forty feet up the face of the precipice, full in the sun's rays, the mask of greenery had been opened and men could be seen working through the gap.
Evidently these men had found foothold on a shelf concealed by the hanging vines.
At the distance from which they were viewed by Whipple and his companions the forms were indistinct, although it could clearly be seen that there were three of them.
“Say, this is bully!" exclaimed Vandeever, all the joy of a prospective deliverance rising in his soul.
“As they climb in, we’ll climb out.
Like enough, horses brought them through the hills to the canon; well, we'll arrange to use them caballos for the trip back to Phoenix. luck He started across the flat in the direction of the cliff where the newcomers were at work, but Whipple caught his arm.
“Not so fast, Charley. wait here and watch for a while. something about that cabin that never looked just right to me.
It will be better, I think, to let those fellows get down into the canon before we show ourselves to them.
They might decide not to come on if they found strangers here."
Vandeever looked thoughtful.
“Strikes me you’re too blame cautious. he said, “but mebby it’s jest as well to play safe."
He drew back into the tree shadows and continued to fix his gaze on the wall. a path down that cliffside, back o' them vines, right to the p'int where them hombres are workin'," ran his comment, “and mebby that's the way Johnson Blue got in.
But how do you reckon they found it?
We never guessed there was a shelf part way up the wall, did we?"
“It wouldnot have done us any good if we had," put in Simmons.
“That shelf is all of thirty-five feet straight up, and we had no way of getting to it.
By Jupiter, look at that!"
Something was tossed out through the gap in the vines.
It twisted, writhed, unfolded, and dropped down-, ward, resolving itself into a long rope ladder.
As soon as it was in place, the three men descended from the shelf, one by one, and landed on the flat.
By that time the whole canon was plunged in gloom, although the eastern rim rock still glimmered under the sun's rays.
“Wait till they get to the cabin," Whipple suggested, “and then we’ll walk in on them. light up, and we'll be able to give each other a good siz• ing. give ’em a big surprise," chuckled Vandeever, “if I know anything about it."
The newcomers trailed like shadows across the flat, making straight for the cabin.
Whipple, Vandeever, and Simmons followed them at a distance. bet a blue stack," the cowboy hazarded, “that they’ve got a mine down here; placerings, like as not." no gold in Lost Creek Canon," averred Whipple; been keeping an eye out for that ever since we got here, and the formations arenot right." their idee in cornin’ here, then?" what like to know.
Men arenot going to all this trouble in Lost Creek Canon unless they have something up their sleeves.
It doesnot look right, Charley.”
The newcomers had reached the cabin, and lamplight suddenly glowed in the cabin windows.
Whipple and his two companions pushed on hurriedly and stepped in through the open door.
They were greeted by a yell that indicated surprise and anything but friendliness. a Digger if it ainot Concho Charley, the cattle-puncher gent as got to us for all that dough in the back room at whooped a voice.
“Sure it’s him cried some one else.
“And he’s bringin’ his pard, Monte Cristo, junior!
Surprisin’ luck, if anybody asks you.”
“Simmons,” a third person demanded, “how did you happen to miss the flats, the other morning?
And how did you happen to know about this canon, and get here and be waiting for us with these lambs of the golden fleece?
You seem to have played your cards pretty well, but be hanged if I can understand it.”
Whipple was amazed.
The last speaker was Monte a trim-looking blackleg in fancy mountaineer clothes.
The two with him were his roughneck pals, “Pecos” Pete Geohegan and “Silver” Sam Hornaday.
All in all, they were about as hard an outfit as ever drifted through the Arizona hills.
Each of the three was well armed and, at the moment, had a vicious six-gun on display.
What weird turn of fate had brought these men into that lonely canon?
Whipple wished, then, that he had been even more cautious.
Bound for Los Angeles on a quest for spendthrift pleasures, neither he nor his companions had carried anything in the way of firearms. and his partners were holding all the trumps, that hand.
The surprises were mutual, but every advantage lay with the newcomers. a fine lot of coyotes, ainot you now?”
Vandeever remarked with fine sarcasm.
“You planned to trim me, there in the back room at but I galloped off with every sou you three had in your clothes matchin’ my run o’ luck ag’inst every nickel-plated holdout in your tinhorn crowd.
Then you schemed to get it all back, by one way or another, and missed the bet.
Oh, you’re a fine outfit of sobbers!”
Monte smiled in the oily way characteristic of him. not missing any bets here in Lost Creek Canon, Concho,” he purred.
“Why didnot you come down at Saddleback Flats according to agreement, Simmons?” he demanded, whirling on the aviator.
“They got wise to me” here Simmons nodded toward Whipple and Vandeever “and it wasnot safe.
Then the engine of the old boat went back on me, and we just happened to land in this canon. glad you got here, Threecard. the best piece of luck that ever came my way.
Whipple and his pard would have killed me, I guess, if I hadnot had help.”
Cold rage rose in heart. you sorry now, he asked, “that you didnot let me beat him up?
Sim has been playin’ off on us.”
Whipple was nonplused.
At the grave of Johnson Blue, such a short time before, he had felt that Simmons’ confession and regrets were sincere but now he had executed a direct aboutface, and was one of crowd.
He made this certain by stepping to the other side of the cabin and joining the ranks of the gamblers.
“How much have they got with them, Simmons?” queried thousand in cash,” was the prompt reply.
“Good I didnot know but they might have hidden it away somewhere.
Put it on the table, Whipple, every last stiver of it.” you never, roared Vandeever. show ’em our teeth.
If they get that dinero, make ’em fight for it!”
He picked up a chair and backed into a corner.
“Concho,” remarked calmly, “when you and your outfit dropped into this canon, you came within one of putting a crimp into the smoothest paign I ever planned.
You found a neat little cabin here, well stocked with supplies.
You and your friends jumped right in and took possession of it. not finding any fault with that; but I want to assure you that while we're here you and Whipple are going to stay here.
I expect to make this place my headquarters for the next six months.
Show fight, Concho, and we’ll drop you in your tracks.
Put down that chair." be foolish, Charley/’ said Whipple; “all the odds are against us."
This easy yielding wasnot at all like Whipple, as Vandeever knew him; so the latter reasoned that his friend had something at the back of his head in the way of a ruse.
Strategy, that was what it must be.
Building his hopes on that, Vandeever lowered the chair, sat clown in it gloomily, and watched while Whipple put all of Uncle money on the table. the part of wisdom, Whipple," observed Monte with unctuous approval.
“You might also sit down, for the moment.
Pecos,” he went on, “you go back to the shelf and pull up the ladder. have an uncomfortable night, up there, but we've got to make sure that Whipple and Concho donot clear out and tip off this new roost of ours to the sheriff.
We canot let that happen, you understand, until we’re through with the canon.
Silver will relieve you in the morning, and to-morrow night Simmons or I will pull up the ladder and sleep on the shelf. forget, Pecos," finished, “that there’s a bundle of money in this for all hands."
The mention of money stifled the grumbling of Pecos.
He put away his gun, pulled up his belt, and left the cabin.
Monte approached the table and coolly appropriated the crisp bank notes that lay there.
“This should mean little to you, Whipple,’’ said he easily. getting rid of it quickly, and with a few thrills that ought to interest Old Plunks.
Sorry to dispossess you, but we’ve got to have the cabin.
You and Concho can bunk down on the flat. see that you donot starve; at least, while we're here in the canon with you.
When we leave for good well, that will be another matter."
“Got a mine here, inquired Vandeever.
Hornaday laughed hoarsely.
“Well, you might call it that,” returned with a twisted smile.
“Pecos must be on the shelf by now," he added, “so you two can clear out. try any foolishness, either of you."
His voice sharpened as he launched the warning. playing for a big stake, and wonot stand for any nonsense on your part.
Good night. send you something to eat in the morning."
Whipple and Vandeever walked out of the cabin, followed by the jeers of Silver Sam Hornaday and Percival Simmons.
As they moved away across the flat, leaving behind them the cabin and its comforts, the cowboy complained bitterly about the aviator.
“He ort to be killed have evened up our score jyith him if you’d only have let me alone a while back.
Now see how he has turned on us.
Johnson book never got to him the same as it did to you and me."
Whipple drew closer to his irate friend.
“Charley," he whispered, believe Simmons is still on our side, and that he’s pretending to stand in with in order to be of help to us."
“Never in this world declared Vandeever emphatically.
“Was that the reason you as so pesky meek in shellin’ out them thousand-dollar bills?
If ’a’ thought you was bankin’ on that.
’a’ fought till I dropped.
Simmons is a two-faced, measly coyote. all off with that noble idee o’ yours to give back the dinero to your uncle.
But that ainot worryin* me so much as gettin’ clear o’ this tough outfit and takin’ a slant for Phoenix.” get back the money before we leave the canon," asserted Whipple.
“How?"
Whipple did not know how, but he believed there would be opportunities and they would be able to manage it.
He led the way through the gloom to the overhang where Johnson Blue had pitched his dismal camp.
“Aimin' to sleep in there, demanded Vandeever.
“Why not?
It gets pretty cold at night, and we must have some kind of shelter.
What was good enough for Blue ought to be good enough for us."
Whipple went down on all fours and crawled through the swinging vines.
The cowboy followed him, finally, but not without many protests.
“Pll bet the place is ha’nted," he muttered.
“Well, it couldnot be haunted by a kindlier spirit than greatly obliged to Johnson Blue, Charley.
He has shown me how to look wisely at some of the problems of life."
“Huh grunted Vandeever “he was only a spender that got cold feet when his money was gone.
Mebby you'll sleep, but be hanged if I think goin' to.
'Night, pard."
A A rock was all that Whipple and Vandeever had to sleep on, there under the overhang.
But they were men of hard fiber and used to the hardships of the hills.
The chastened spirit of Johnson Blue seemed to fill the place.
To Whipple this unseen presence was as a benediction nor was it as disturbing to Vandeever as he had fancied it might be, for when morning came he was sleeping so soundly that his friend had to shake him into wakefulness.
“See anything last night, inquired the cowboy, as he sat up and rubbed his eyes.
“Not a thing."
“Same here.
Glory!
I never reckoned sleep like that. crawl out o' this hole in the wall and find the sun."
A morning in Southern Arizona is one of the most cheering wonders of the country.
The mounting sun has a glory all its own, and the air has a tonic warranted to put to flight all the blue devils that lurk in a human heart.
Vandeever was in a more hopeful mood than on the preceding evening.
“If we could get hold of a couple o' them six-guns," he remarked, while he and Whipple were dipping their heads in the creek, “we neednot ask no odds of anybody, Whipple shook the water out of his hair and dried his face on his handkerchief. play a waiting game, Charley," he said, “and see what turns up. busy getting breakfast over there at the cabin,” he added, his speculative gaze on the smoke that was rising from the chimney. could mow away a man's size share o' grub if I had the chance.
Seems like might invite us in for the morning's snack."
“He wonot do that; he's planning to keep us at a distance from the money and the guns, and will send breakfast out to us.
There comes Sam Hornaday, now," Whipple added.
“And he ainot totin' any chow," grumbled Vandeever disappointedly.
Hornaday, however, was not coming in the direction of the two at the foot of the vine-clad cliff.
He looked in their direction, grinned unpleasantly, and kept on toward the eastern wall.
There he halted and yelled for Pecos.
The latter looked out from the opening among the vines, answered the hail, and then threw down the rope ladder.
“We could capture the ladder from them two if we had any kind o’ luck," Vandeever suggested.
Whipple shook his head.
While Pecos was descending the ladder, Hornaday stood at the foot of it, on guard with a gun in each hand. having a dream, Charley," said Whipple. would be glad to have us try something like that.
After the dust settled, there would be one amalgamator and one cow-puncher to keep Johnson Blue company on this flat.
And what good would the ladder be to us if we had to use it and leave the money behind?" got to have action," Vandeever fretted.
“Walkin' lame and jumpin' through the hoop at orders is a heap more than I can stand.”
“Take it easy; there’ll be plenty of action when the right time conies.”
Pecos, stepping from the rope ladder to the ground, did a brief round of sentry go while Hornaday climbed to the shelf and hoisted the trailing ropes; then Pecos made his way to the cabin.
Everything, so far as cleverness could devise it, had been made secure.
Presently Simmons appeared at the cabin door carrying a basket.
He struck out briskly across the flat, moving in the direction of Whipple and Vandeever.
The latter, breathing hard, jumped to his feet.
Whipple caught him and pulled him back.
“Hang on to yourself, Charley,” he admonished.
“You donot want to spoil our breakfast, do you?” canot begin to tell you how the sight o’ that traitor grinds me,” muttered Vandeever. see that he gets his if it’s the last thing I ever do.”
Simmons halted a few feet away and set down the basket, warily eying the cowboy as he did so.
“Charley is getting me wrong,” he said, pitching his voice low. with you two, but I can be of more help by pretending to stand in with straight.
Kick up some kind of a row so I can have an excuse to stand here and talk for a minute. is watching from the cabin, and Hornaday from the shelf.
At the first suspicion that not really throwing in with them, be as helpless as you two are maybe worse off.”
Whipple jumped to his feet and advanced a step. worse than a sidewinder to turn us down like this!” he shouted, apparently in great anger.
“All I want is a club!” roared Vandeever.
Simmons jerked a revolver from his pocket; seemingly, he was holding the two wrathful men at bay.
What he said, still in an undertone, was this: Hornaday, and Geohegan robbed the bank at Eudora, and they are hiding out here with sixty thousand dollars in cash and Liberty Bonds.
They have fixed up this canon for a hang-out, and have some more robberies they are aiming to pull off.
When they found us here it sort of spilled the beans.
Go easy, you two.
And be watchful.
Bullets are apt to come your way at any time. not done yet.
Do something make it look as though there is bad blood between us and you are trying to ‘get’ me.
I was told to shoot at the first sign of trouble.”
Vandeever started to make a rush.
Crack! went Simmons’ revolver.
The bullet flew wide, but Vandeever clutched at his left arm and reeled back. to be on the shelf to-night, guarding the ladder,” Simmons went on, speaking hurriedly. our chance to do something. come down around midnight, and we’ll see what we can do at the cabin.
It will be desperate, though; make up your minds to that.”
Simmons whirled on his heel and started back across the flat, turning again and again to flourish the revolver and shout wild threats. reckon that play looked like the real thing,” said Vandeever; “and sure surprised at that Sim!
At that, mebby he’s only stringin’ us along.”
“Give him the benefit of the doubt, Charley,” urged Whipple. prove to your satisfaction whether or not we can rely on him to-night.”
“It donot seem right sensible that would send him here with that grub, unless there was some kind of a hen on,” mused the cowboy darkly.
He was rolling up his sleeve and binding a handkerchief about his arm, a red silk handkerchief with which he had supplied himself in Phoenix.
Having pretended to be wounded, it was important to keep the deception alive.
While eating breakfast, he did not use his left hand, but kept it tucked away between the buttons of his coat.
The meal was a generous one, consisting of coffee, crackers, bacon, and fried potatoes.
As the two friends ate, they considered this new turn of events.
Monte, widely known as a crooked gambler, had blossomed into an robber and holdup man.
A safe retreat from the law was that hidden and inaccessible canon.
How had found it was a mystery but, having found it, he was not slow to recognize its value from a lawless viewpoint.
If pressed by officers of the law, he could come down his rope ladder; and, if the canon were found, he could pull down the ladder as a last resort.
From that spot he and his confederates could make their raids and then return to a rendezvous that was almost proof against discovery.
Naturally, finding Whipple and his companions in the canon was a disagreeable surprise to The unpleasantness, however, was tempered by the seventy-five thousand dollars which Whipple had been forced to give up.
For a little while, and because of Uncle money> the gambler might bear with the castaways; but, in due course, as Whipple knew, Monte would tire of the trouble Whipple and Vandeever made him and would seek to eliminate them.
Before this tragic move was deliberately attempted, the amalgamator and the cowboy would have to strike and strike hard, with Simmons’ help. is the time,” averred Whipple, “for we are taking grave chances if we wait longer than that.”
Having finished his breakfast, he lighted a pipe and arose to his feet. go over to the bend and see if the wreck of the Ace High has anything to offer us in the way of a makeshift weapon.
If we come to close quarters with the gang to-night, Charley, we ought to have something besides our fists to fight with.”
“Good idee, assented Vandeever.
As they started north along the creek, suddenly appeared from the cabin.
He carried a rifle.
“Where have you started for?” he shouted.
“Jest takin’ a little amble to stretch our legs,” Vandeever answered, with a scowl.
“Well, amble around the flat, but keep clear of the cabin.
Try to leave the flat, Concho, and we’ll open up on you.
That goes as it lays.”
Vandeever hesitated, clenching his fist and grinding his teeth.
“Fust time on record I ever took orders from a tinhorn he growled.
“But I reckon there ainot anything else to be done.”
He turned and began following Whipple back toward the vine-clad cliff.
“And here’s something else,” yelled.
“You two have got to cut out the rough stuff when I send some one over with your meals.
Simmons ought to have laid you out, Concho.
Just for what you did this morning you men will get no dinner.
If you prove to be peaceable, and obey orders about staying on the flat, take some supper over to you myself.”
Vandeever was furious, but he had sense enough to smother his feelings.
Most certainly he and Whipple were under the thumb of this smooth, tricky card sharp; and, hard though it was, the situation would have to be borne for the present.
The morning passed with another reading of Johnson book, and the discussions to which the various philosophical gems gave rise.
In view of the melancholy circumstances that prevailed in the canon, the last words of the wastrel castaway were more impressive than ever.
Noon passed, and was as good as his word about withholding dinner.
At one o’clock, Pecos relieved Silver as guardian of the ladder, and both ruffians, in going and coming, jeered the two hungry men as they passed them.
“This is fierce, tell a man!” grunted Vandeever.
“Hit me anywhere but where I live; I can stand anything but that.”
“We ought to be able to miss a meal with good grace, Charley,” said Whipple.
“Think what Blue had to put up with.”
“Oh, stand it,” returned the cowboy hastily, “but like to eat a hundred dollars wuth o’ ham and eggs in front of and him famishin* and laced to a post with a reata.”
The afternoon dragged horribly. and Hornaday and Simmons played cards in the shade of the cabin, guns close at hand.
They were careful to take up a position from which they could watch Whipple and deever every minute.
As the sun dropped low over the rim of the canon, the card playing ceased, and Hornaday and Simmons went into the house to get supper.
When was called by Hornaday to “Come in an’ eat,” he stood up and looked in the direction of the amalgamator and the cowboy. changed my mind, Conho,” he called.
“You and your pard stood it so well without dinner that going to hold back ypur supper.”
Vandeever gave an ugly laugh as vanished inside the cabin.
“Even a smooth tinhorn like him can play the fool now and then, he remarked to his friend.
“The worst fighter I ever seen was a guy just hungry enough to be mad and not starved sufficient to be any ways weak.
Because of losin' them two meals, walk in on the hull gang this minute, alone and with my bare hands. going to be some fight when we pull it off.” had played well a very difficult role.
It was no easy maneuver to deceive Monte and yet this is precisely what Simmons had done.
The gambler was convinced that the aviator was faithful to him and his lawless, plottings, and believed fully that no love was lost between the aviator and Whipple and Vandeever.
So Simmons was trusted with the work of guarding the rope ladder.
He relieved Pecos and went on duty while the sun was still flashing brightly on the vine-clad wall but he had not been fifteen minutes on the shelf before and Hornaday ran swiftly across the flat and took up their positions at the foot of the cliff.
“Hey, Simmons shouted “What are you doing with two extra six-guns? got a brace of revolvers more than you need or are entitled to.
Drop them into the blanket.”
As he finished speaking,* he and Hornaday stretched a blanket between them and waited for the weapons to be thrown into it.
But they waited in vain.
Whipple and Vandeever guessed what had happened.
In his zeal to help them, Simmons had appropriated the extra revolvers and taken them with him when he climbed to the shelf.
He was not minded to give them up and so yield an advantage gained by his cleverness.
Besides, faith in him was shaken, and temporizing with a man like this gambler when he was in such a state of mind would have been suicidal.
Simmons kept well back on the shelf and hung on to the guns.
Hornaday lost patience and swore heartily. had better command of himself.
“Put over the ladder, Percy, and come down,” requested the gambler, his tone and manner not at all suggestive of the emotions that filled him.
Simmons, however, was too knowing to let down the ladder and descend and place himself at the mercy of Threecard Monte.
“Come down!” the gambler ordered at last, dropping his mask of friendliness and proceeding to threats. give you two minutes, and if you're not down by that time Silver and I will riddle the face of the cliff with bullets.”
No word or sign came from Simmons then, promptly when the two minutes were up, a merry fusillade stirred wild echoes in the canon.
Pecos, a cup of coffee in one hand and a sour-dough biscuit in the other, came to a corner of the cabin to watch the excitement.
Whipple was not slow to see that a situation had developed which, if quickly and properly used, would be highly advantageous to himself and Vandeever.
“Charley,” he whispered, “while and Hornaday are busy with Simmons, and while Geohegan is giving all his attention to that side of the canon, no one seems to take any interest in you and me.
Come on! detour to the west and reach the cabin door while Geohegan is facing the other way.”
“That scheme is a lulu, muttered the cowboy, with enthusiasm.
A quick run to the left brought the two around the western side of the cabin.
Whipple was almost at the open door when Pecos awoke to what was going on behind him.
The coffee cup went one way and what was left of the biscuit went another.
“No; y’u donot he roared, dashing for the open door and juggling with a revolver as he came on.
“Back up, or drop y’u where y’u stand Whipple shifted his line of advance, and instead of entering the cabin he plunged straight at Pecos.
The latter halted, planted himself firmly and lifted the revolver.
Whipple was desperate, and Geohegan equally determined.
A distant report shattered the still air, breaking a lull in the target practice of and Hornaday.
Geohegan gave vent to a hoarse yell of pain, and the revolver fell from his fist.
“Score one for Sim shouted Vandeever jubilantly.
“That was as neat a bit of drop firin’ as I ever seen.”
Simmons had come into action, and at the very instant his services could best serve his friends.
Whipple reached side at a jump, and in a flash had gathered up the fallen weapon.
“Into the cabin with you he ordered, prodding Pecos with the muzzle of the gun.
“Monte yelled Pecos, as he gripped his injured right arm with his left hand “Sam! trouble at the ca Whipple gave Pecos a push that sent him through the open door headlong. got him, cried Vandeever, from inside the cabin.
“Get in here, quick Once the door is closed we can hold this shack ag’inst all comers.”
That move, however, effective though it might be, was not for Whipple. and Hornaday had lost all interest in Simmons, for the moment, and were racing back toward the cabin.
A revolver cracked, and a bullet buzzed angrily past cheek.
He found himself looking into the gambler’s cool, murderous eyes. told you what to expect if you cut any capers,” snapped “and now here’s where you get yours.”
His first shot had missed because he was in too much of a hurry.
Now he was more deliberate, and laughed jeeringly when Whipple, flexing his finger, brought down the hammer of gun on an empty shell. no doubt, felt that he could afford to take his time and make sure.
Whipple was nearer the Great Divide, at that moment, than Uncle Wes had ever been in his life.
But wasted three seconds and, while his weapon hung fire, a cabin window on his left crashed outward and, in the midst of the flying glass came Vandeever over the sill, falling on the gambler and bearing him down. the best ever, Charley!” exclaimed Whipple, and immediately gave his full attention to Hornaday. selected his lawless aids with care and discrimination, and Geohegan and Hornaday were the pick of those men who regarded the law lightly and were of proved ability and courage.
The tide was setting against but Hornaday ran true to his traditions and, while possibly dismayed, he was ready for a last-ditch fight.
Flinging himself down behind a small heap of firewood a few yards from the corner of the cabin, he began taking pot shots at Whipple from cover.
Indian fashion, Whipple took to a tree thus screened, he “broke” the weapon that had failed him in the contest with and examined the shells in the cylinder.
All were empty and useless a piece of carelessness on part which, in other circumstances, would have won a rebuke from Vandeever had dragged into the cabin; and there, judging by the sounds that came through the open door, he was fairly busy.
With a useless gun, and no cartridges at hand with which to replenish the cylinder, Whipple was at an impasse.
Hornaday, watching weasel-eyed, was waiting for him to show enough of himself to make a target worth while.
This blockade was lifted by Simmons, as unexpectedly as Vandeever had crashed through the window and fered with Watching from the shelf in the gathering half gloom, the aviator had realized how badly he was needed by his friends; so he had lowered the ladder, crossed the flat, and come up noiselessly on side of the woodpile.
The first Whipple knew of this was by a startled yell from Hornaday.
The yell was followed by sounds of a furious struggle, and Whipple left the oak tree and ran swiftly to give Simmons a hand.
From that point on the struggle was as brief as it was decisive.
When Hornaday, at the revolver’s point, was marched into the cabin, was discovered flat on his back on the floor, two knees on his chest, one hand compressing his throat, and the other hand, gripping revolver, threatening and holding Geohegan at bay.
A little work on the part of Whipple and Simmons made the victory complete.
Ropes were found, and the gambler and his confederates were firmly lashed and rendered helpless. hands ere left free, because of his wounded arm, but his feet were bound, and it was clear that he had lost all relish for further combat.
‘That was short and snappy, tell a man!”
Vandeever exulted.
“About twice as short and snappy, as if you had treated me and white and given us our grub.
If you want to make a reg’lar panther out of a man, jest give him a touch o’ famine. that never occur to you?”
“If you fellows want your seventyfive thousand dollars,” said “take it and get out of here.”
“We want more than that, spoke up Whipple. the loot from the Eudora bank.
You donot think for a minute that we’ll leave that behind The gambler scowled.
“Simmons told you about that, I reckon.
And Concho wasnot nicked at all, this morning?”
Vandeever laughed as he held up both hands.
“That was jest a possum play, he answered.
“How does it feel, havin’ the boot on t’other leg?
Sim,” he added turning and giving his hand to the aviator, “you are the clear quill.”
“Thank Johnson Blue for that,” said Simmons humbly, as he shook the cowboy’s hand; “the writings in that little book have given me a brand-new outlook upon life. glad we fell into this canon.”
“Same here,” supplemented Vandeever.
His glance roved reflectively over the supper table, and the remains of the meal left by and his men.
“You strike a light, he went on, “and stir up the fire and rustle some hot chow.
Honest, I was never so hungry in all my born days.
Poor old Blue!
For half a day we’ve been under his pack o’ trouble here in starvation Gulch.
It brought us right close to him, donot you think?” supplies in the cabin were raided for a bountiful meal, and it was served piping hot.
When Vandeever at last pushed back from the table and lighted a cigarette, he was in a genial and happy mood. a satchel under that east bunk, Whipple,” remarked Simmons, “and you will find your money and the bank loot inside. was cashier and took charge of all the boodle.”
Whipple found the small satchel, cleared a space on the table, and began checking over the contents of the satchel.
All his thousand-dollar bills were, of course, intact; in addition to these, he found twenty thousand dollars in bank notes of twenty, fifty, and onehundred-dollar denominations, all banded in packets.
Also, there were Liberty Bonds to the amount of forty thousand dollars more.
“This is fine!” exclaimed Whipple happily.
“Now I can give my uncle’s money the most of it back to him, and we can turn over the stolen loot to the bank.” a pinhead, Whipple, if you do anything like that,” spoke up “Why donot you three men divide it up among you and take a trip abroad?”
Whipple laughed, Vandeever glared, and Simmons looked uncomfortable.
“What you need, you thievin’ tinhorn,” said Vandeever, “is a course of study in Johnson book.
Forty a month and found is all lookin’ for’ard to; and tell a man that the prospect is more pleasin’ to me than ever it was in my old careless days.
Funny how a batch of writin’s like gets under a feller’s hide, ainot it?
Whipple, Vandeever, and Simmons passed their last night in the canon cabin.
While two of them slept, one was always on guard.
The prisoners were resourceful and desperate men, and no chances were to be taken with them.
Next morning there was an early breakfast, and the three friends made their preparations for leaving the cabin and getting out of the hills.
Three canteens were filled with cool, clear water from the creek, and three packs of supplies were made ready.
Three revolvers belonging to and his partners were appropriated, and their cylinders replenished with fresh ammunition.
Whipple had tried hard to learn something about the situation of the canon, the route to be followed in getting back to Phoenix, and the method by which and those with him had reached that part of the rough country.
The gambler had nothing to tell him, and neither had Hornaday nor Geohegan. never make it on foot,” had said “your grub and water will be gone before you are halfway out.
A stray prospector may find your bones, some time in the future, but even that is a bet.”
“Then,” returned Whipple coolly, “it will be as hard on you as it is on us; for when we leave here, we’ll haul up the rope ladder.
If we get out, we’ll send a sheriff and posse back after you. better, isnot it, than starving to death in this canon?”
A gloomy expression crossed the faces of Hornaday and Geohegan, but the gambler seemed utterly unmoved.
“Not according to my way of thinking,” said All the firearms in the cabin were carried away by Whipple and his friends.
Geohegan was left with his hands free, and it would be only a short time before he released and Hornaday of their bonds.
Carrying off the guns was to prevent further trouble while the homeward-bound party climbed to the rim rock and set out on the eastern trail.
Whipple, who was the last man to reach the shelf, found himself on a broad, smooth ledge which had a downward pitch to the place where it joined the cliff.
Simmons explained how easy it had been to keep clear of bullets launched from the flat merely by hugging the rear wall.
“And there’s the way up,” he finished, indicating the lip of a fissure that angled steeply toward the top of the wall, back of the swinging vines. had a mind to explore that, only didnot give me time.”
The rope ladder was drawn up and piled on the shelf, and all the extra firearms were laid beside it; then, Whipple leading, the climb for the top was begun.
Steady nerves were demanded for this, and the amalgamator was glad that the festooned vines hid from his eyes the dizzy depths of the canon.
In due course he came out on the crest of the bank, and paused to let his gaze rove over the flat.
All the prisoners were free of their ropes and standing in a forlorn group by the cabin, their faces no more than white patches against the greenery below.
Hornaday and Geohegan shook their fists; coolly lighted a cigarette. gaze moved toward the left, where a sandy mound lifted itself among the trees.
All that was mortal of Johnson Blue was there a misguided man who found wisdom in the spot where death overtook him.
“Kind o’ rough on Blue,” remarked Vandeever, halting at side, “leavin’ him with that bunch of tough customers.
You got his book, And his eighteen cents?” have, Charley,” replied Whipple, “and let us hope that the spirit of his last writings will be with us and nerve us for our fight in getting out of these hills.”
He turned to look eastward.
It was a discouraging vista, for all that could be seen in that direction was peak after peak.
Whipple descended an easy slope on his way to a seam that opened between two of the hills.
He stopped suddenly, his eyes on the sand in front of him.
“One secret is out, anyway!” he exclaimed. got here in an automobile. where the machine stopped to let him and his two partners off; and there's where it turned to take the back track.”
A note of cheer crept into his voice.
If an automobile could get here,” he went on, donot see how we’re going to run into any very hard traveling.
All we've got to do is to follow the tracks.”
The tracks were easily traced, and led into the seam, wound tortuously about the bases of the hills, and then climbed a ridge and descended into a wide, shallow valley.
The sun was mounting toward the zenith, a brazen, fiery shield whose rays grew hotter as the day wore on.
Heat waves, rising from the baked earth, quivered in the furnacelike air.
Clumps of cholla cactus and greasewood danced grotesquely when viewed through the wavering, transparent veil.
Simmons was first to give out.
He staggered to his knees with a groan. no good at this kind of travel,” he complained.
“This pack on my shoulders weighs a ton.”
For the dozenth time he uncapped his canteen and put it to his lips.
Vandeever snatched it away from him. waterlogged, Sim,” said the cowboy.
“We got to be careful o' the stuff in the canteens.
And, anyways, you could drink like a fish and it wouldnot help none.
Get up and try ag'in; help you.”
With Vandeever on one side and Whipple on the other, lending him their support, the aviator reeled on.
Over his head the amalgamator and the cowboy exchanged significant glances.
Simmons was not toughened to the deserts, as they were, and they realized that he was going to be a tremendous handicap.
But he had played a man’s part in the canon. face set hard, and lips tightened.
What one thought was at that moment in the mind of the other: They would all win clear of those scorched, waterless hills, or they would all stay in them to the end of time.
When Simmons' feet refused to move another step, Whipple found a great, bare pinnacle of rock, and in its shadow all three sat down for a rest.
They ate some of their food, washing it down with a few sips from the canteens.
When the time came for them to start on again, Whipple and Vandeever scanned the sky with ominous eyes and decided to remain where they were.
The hilltops to the north were blurred with a haze of ghastly yellow.
The haze thickened into an opaque curtain and drew onward with a rush.
A puff of wind, blistering hot, stirred the sand of the valley until the ground seemed to be smoking. an elegant row of stumps, growled Vandeever; “a thing like this couldnot happen only right now, could it?” the matter?” queried Simmons.
“Sand storm,” answered Whipple briefly.
“Hug the lee of that rock, Simmons; and pull off your coat and have it ready to put over your head.”
They all knelt and pushed close to the rock pinnacle.
The flying sand whispered against its worn sides; then, as the wind increased in fury, gusty blasts eddied around the huge bowlder and drove the sand stingingly against their faces.
The yellow fog was all around them, and the smothering heat made breathing almost impossible.
With heads muffled in their coats they gasped and choked and almost stifled.
The physical torment brought by the storm gave the impression that it was hours in passing, but its duration could have been measured in minutes.
After reaching its height it breathed itself out, leaving three mounds of sand from which the travelers extricated themselves.
“That was shorter than usual, remarked Vandeever, shaking the sand out of his sleeves and wiping it from his grimy face.
“The worst thing it did to us was to blot out the tracks of that automobile, said Whipple; “now we’ve got to head east, and go it blind.”
When their packs were disinterred, it was discovered that Simmons’ canteen was missing.
He could remember nothing, about it.
All three spent an hour kicking around in the loose sand, and were compelled at last to give up the search.
Losing the canteen was a calamity, but nothing was said by Whipple or Vandeever to make Simmons feel worse about his carelessness than he did.
They struggled on down that interminable valley, their only blessing the lessening heat of the sun as it dropped toward its setting.
Another halt was made at sundown.
The aviator, by that time, was in a sorry state.
His eyes were puffed, his tongue and lips were swollen, and the last particle of energy had been sapped from his body.
But there was a growing coolness in the air that was most refreshing, and Simmons slumped to the ground, closed his eyes and slept.
Whipple aroused him, after a while, and gave him his rations from the packs.
He ate, gulped down the little water he was allowed to have, then went to sleep again.
An hour later his two companions got him to his feet once more, and they continued their weary plodding onward under the brilliant Arizona night sky.
Whipple conned their course by the stars and pressed the pace.
There was now a very decided chill in the air which would have been most uncomfortable had the three travelers not been constantly moving.
Simmons bore up better than he had done during the day, but his strength was flagging even while Whipple and Vandeever were going at their best. no good at this,” he panted “you fellows go on and leave me here.
When you get out, send somebody back to pick me up.”
“Not on your tintype, Sim!” returned the cowboy with emphasis.
“We all go or we all stay, and that’s flat.
Buck up!
We can make five miles at night a heap easier than we can do one by day.
Here, we’ll help you.”
Whipple and Vandeever took turns carrying Simmons’ pack and helping to support him.
They managed to keep him on his feet until after midnight, and then found further attempts useless.
Dropping to the ground on the very spot where Simmons gave out, all of them slept, dog weary and worn to the point of exhaustion.
They awoke with the blazing sun once more in their eyes, and the blistering heat growing as the sun mounted toward the higher heavens.
Then began such a struggle as neither Whipple nor Vandeever had ever known in all their Arizona years.
Simmons grew light-headed and became hard to manage.
He fought to get hold of the canteens and the few drops of water that remained in them; he discarded his pack he sat down obstinately and refused to move; in short, he did everything his irrational mind suggested to delay the journey.
The amalgamator and the cowboy grappled with him, dragged him, carried him, their one consuming desire to get onward at any cost.
Simmons began to see visions of flowing water and green trees.
He babbled about them, and tried to crawl to the shelter of the groves and reach the streams.
Vandeever, sprawled in the hot sand, gave vent to a croaking laugh.
He reached out gropingly with his hands. my canteen, he asked faintly.
“Right in front of you there!” exclaimed the startled Whipple. you see it, Charley?”
“See nothin’; been sun blind for an hour.
Poor old Blue never went through anything like this, old-timer; he had Lost Creek with him all the way.
Jest uncap one o’ the canteens, will you, Whipple uncapped both canteens.
One was dry and in the other there remained no more than a swallow of water.
He pressed the canteen to lips.
“Now you better take a swig,” suggested Vandeever.
“Sure,” said Whipple, and tossed the canteen away.
Once more Vandeever laughed. we the gay spenders for you?” he croaked. hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollars in our jeans and we couldnot buy a glass o’ water with it.
All gone, you old seed; you canot fool me.
Made me take the last drop, didnot you?
Well, that’s about like you is all I can say, There was no answer.
With an effort, Vandeever got to his knees and crawled over the hot sand, groping with his hands.
He found what he was hunting for, at last: a still form, crumpled and motionless.
He felt the face, and with his hand he patted one of the shoulders.
“Best pard a man ever had he muttered.
“If here’s where we take the Long Trail, I couldnot ask for no better company.” rode back to consciousness on a sea of troubled dreams and a voice, which had an oddly familiar sound, caused him to sit up quickly and take notice.
It was night, one of those splendid nights for which the desert country is noted.
The stars were so big and bright that it seemed as though one had only to reach out a hand in order to get hold of Belt, or of the Big or Little Bear.
There was a lush smell of standing water, and Whipple lowered his eyes and saw a good-sized water hole, surrounded by a dusky chaparral of mesquite.
How the moonbeams played and danced over that stretch of water In the nearer distance was a glowing camp fire.
A very tall man in sharp silhouette was jerking a bag from the teeth of a scrawny, crop-eared burro.
Tossing the bag on a heap of camp plunder, the man hauled the burro away on a picket rope. picket you where you wonot be so handy to the grub, Handsome,” said the boss of the camp, and he and the burro lost themselves temporarily in the chaparral shadows. wandering glances took in his closer vicinity.
Vandeever lay on one side of him, his eyes bandaged with a white cloth.
On the other side lay Simmons.
“Hey, Charley!” called Whipple softly.
“On deck, sport,” answered the cowboy promptly.
“How you stackin’ up?”
“All right.
Feel so comfortable a notion been watered and fed.”
“Plumb comfortable myself, except my eyes.
The old geezer put somethin’ on ’em and tied ’em up; he says it’s a sure cure, and that be able to see things by sunrise.”
Whipple turned to the aviator.
“How are you, Sitnmons?” he queried.
“Sort of hazy,” Simmons told him. had a particularly bad dream and canot remember a thing since the sand storm till I woke up here.”
“This prospector must have found us and brought us to the water hole,” Whipple went on. what he done,” said Vandeever “he told me about that while he was bandagin’ my lamps.
He allows we was all three purty badly done up when he happened upon us.”
“Who is he? heard that voice of his before somewhere.”
Here the tall man himself drew near and stood at side. heard this bazoo of mine many a time, he put in.
“Give me a good look, Whipple turned his head and stared.
Then he his eyes and gave a gasp.
“Uncle Wes?” he said incredulously.
“Well, it canot be Uncle Wes!
Can it?”
The tall man laughed. me, all right.
That doctor you sent down from Prescott found out that my heart was as good as anybody’s, and that all I needed was exercise.
Her prescription was to stir around and be active. what been doin', ever since you sailed away in a flyin’ machine and dropped plumb off the earth.
Pm not feelin' more than thirty years old, this minute.
This spell of desert ramblin' has chirked me up wonderful.
That lady doc— doctor sure knows her business."
For a minute or two Whipple was so overwhelmed that he lost the power of speech.
At last he found his tongue.
“Lady doctor!" he echoed.
“Is that Doctor Mixinger a lady?"
“In every sense o' the word, declared Uncle Wes “and she's a right competent lady, if anybody wants to ask you.
As soon as I found I had thirty years to live instead of only six months, of course my deal with you was off.
I had to get back my money before you had spent it all.
Believe me, I did stir around I figgered that every day I lost while lookin' for you cost me more than three thousand dollars.
And I lost a lot of 'em, mainly because you and your party had climbed into the sky and nobody had any idee where you had come down.
The guess was pretty general that you were all killed by an accident to your machine and were lyin' in the mountains somewhere.
Naturally, I wanted to beat the coyotes to my money.
Monte had put up a job on you, and “We know about that, Uncle Wes," cut in Whipple.
“So Charley Vandeever was tellin’ me.
Well, the sheriff and a posse started for Saddleback Flats," Uncle Wes continued “and Galusha Mingo and Katie and me, we got an automobile and followed ’em up, but “Katie!" murmured Whipple.
“Did she try to find me, too?" never saw a girl feel so bad over anything as she did over the way you disappeared.
She and Galusha are still looking for you, but they are staying at Jimmie cabin in Apache Draw, and doin' their searchin' from there.
You see, there was no sign of you at Saddleback Flats, and no sign of and his crowd; but we all had a notion you had been wrecked in the mountains, so we began to hunt, each in our different ways.
I borrowed Jimmie burro, Handsome, and got a grub stake off of Jimmie, and put off into the hills on my own.
The sheriff and his bunch are usin' an automobile, and Galusha and daughter Katie are ridin' hossback.
“Day before yesterday I hit some automobile tracks.
I could tell by the treads of the tires that them tracks wasnot made by the sheriff's machine, so I follered ’em straight into the heart of the rough country.
I reckoned I was getting purty warm just when that blamed sand storm hit the hills and wiped out the automobile tracks.
I made for this water hole, as soon as I dug Handsome and myself out of the drifted sand, and pitched camp here; then I strolled up that wide valley and fairly stumbled over you and your two pards.
It looked for a spell as though you lay right where the flyin' machine had dropped you, and that about all that was left of you was ree-mains.
But I was wrong, for all three of you were alive.
Two swallows of water made Vandeever sit up and talk; then I began to get the hang o’ things.
I was playin' in great luck, and you and your friends were doing the same."
The suddenness with which his uncle had stepped out of the role of a confirmed invalid, and spread himself over the country in active pursuit of what was left of his hundred thousand dollars, was a matter of consuming wonder to Whipple.
Now that Uncle Wes had a long life ahead of him, nothing was more natural than that he should want his money back again. should say we were in luck!” declared Whipple.
“You understand got a right to take back what's left of my money?”
“Of course Why, Uncle Wes, I was planning to return it to you." shy something like twentyfive thousand, said the old tightwad.
“Are you willin’ to make it up to me a nice kind of an uncle, you old skinflint yelped Vandeever.
“After tellin’ to go out and spend the dinero, you're now crawfishin' on your own game.
How can he give you back what he hasnot got an extry twenty thousand in cash in the satchel," remarked Uncle Wes, “and forty thousand in Liberty Bonds."
“You canot have them, uncle," said Whipple; “they belong to the Eudora bank loot." a reward of five thousand dollars out for capturin' the robbers," returned Uncle Wes cannily, “and ten per cent of all the loot recovered.
That means eleven thousand cornin' to you.
That would help some."
“Part of the reward goes to Charley and Simmons," Whipple told his uncle, “but you can have my third of it."
“Then there's somethin' else," pursued Uncle Wes.
“You gave Muggyone Mike Moloney fifty dollars, and the old hassayamper used it for a grubstake, drawin' up an agreement with you, signin' it and leavin' it with Felix Vannell at the Fordham.
And be blessed if Muggyone didnot prance right out into the Phoenix Mountains and drop onto a true fissure that everybody has walked over for the last fifty years!
The rock goes fifty dollars to the ton, and already Muggyone has been offered a big price for his find.
Muggyone located that prospect, filed on it, and had the big offer to buy all in less'n ten days Fastest work on ree-cord and the only time in his hull rovin’ life that Muggyone ever had any luck.
It hasnot run much in his line."
“You three go ahead and sleep," Uncle Wes continued; goin' to sit up and keep the fire blazin' bright.
The sheriff and his posse are trailin' around in this part of the hills, and tryin' to signal 'em. readin' a right interestin' book you had in the satchel with all that money the last writings of Johnson Blue."
“Go ahead and read it," urged Vandeever, as he fell back on the sand and turned over on his side; “if you wasnot such an iron-clad old hiderack, mebby them words of would get under your skin and do some good.
But it wonot do no harm to give 'em a chance, anyways." is all a part of history now the sudden and meteoric rise of one Wesley Whipple, who rode into Phoenix one spring day scattering ballads all along the trail from the Threeply Mine to town.
His story, as one gleans it from the papers, reads like a tale from “The Thousand and One Nights."
First, there was Uncle Wesley Plunkett deceiving himself with the help of Doc Flickinger into believing he was already climbing the foothills of the Great Divide, and was to be over the summit in three months to a day, almost to an hour.
Then came the queer proceeding whereby Uncle Wes, executing a right-about from his miserly habits, gave his nephew outright one hundred thousand dollars to spend and enjoy; and a few days later, in a spirit of rich comedy, the record tells of Doctor Mixinger, of Prescott, proving to the old prospector, by stern methods, that his heart was all right and that he still had thirty years to live.
There were chuckles in Phoenix over that, and more chuckles over the way Old Plunks went into the hills hunting for his vanished nephew and what remained of the hundred thousand.
All Arizona knew, in due course, how Whipple and Vandeever and their hired aviator, Simmons, had been cast away in the mysterious Lost Creek Canon, and there had been found by Hornaday, and Geohegan, fresh from Saddleback Flats where they had missed a gay scheme of plunder only to connect with it again in pocket among the hills.
How Whipple and his comrades had turned the tables on and his men, left them in the canon, and almost perished on their way out of the hills, were but parts of a story told over and over in store and dwelling, among the mines and on the cattle ranges.
And the “kick" which fate had put into this particular angle of the affair was wrapped up in the fact that himself was the one who had found and rescued his nephew, Vandeever, and Simmons; not only getting back what remained of his money, but also and this was the big, the marvelous thing as it turned out finding the book of Johnson Blue and developing an absorbed interest in the wastrel's sound philosophy.
The whole Southwest learned how the sheriff and posse in their flivver caught smoke signals from the camp at the water hole, made for it, and learned about the bank looters trapped and held in Lost Creek Canon.
Vandeever, his sight restored, but with eyes protected by smoked glasses, furnished by Uncle Wes, piloted the law officers along the shallow valley, over the ridge, through the seam, and so to the canon.
There the wily and his two roughneck confederates were captured with very little trouble, and landed behind the bars of the building in the courthouse plaza in Phoenix.
After the courts had dealt with them, they were taken to another place of stone walls and bars for an extended stay.
Bad news, however, was current regarding Mogollon Mike Moloney and the fifty-dollar grubstake furnished by Whipple.
Originally it had been bestowed as a free gift to an old friend, but so “white” was Moloney in his intentions that, in secret, he drew up a grubstake agreement and deposited it with Felix Vanned in trust for Whipple.
The mine was sold ultimately for fifty thousand dollars.
Of this amount, however, Whipple received nothing, as Moloney lost the entire amount in settling gambling debts, which he incurred on the strength of his find. fifty dollars, cast as bread upon the waters, therefore never returned to him, and the incident could not be included among the dazzling romances of the mining country.
But, as Whipple remarked, he had expected nothing and therefore could not be disappointed.
The bank reward went share and share alike to Whipple, Vandeever, and Simmons.
And Vandeever and Simmons were not forgotten by Whipple for when the latter bought a ranch near Prescott, Charley Van had an interest in it and acted as foreman; and Simmons, who started wrong, but caught himself up through the writings of the late Johnson Blue, was also given a position.
The right kind of prosperity dawned for everybody; and, seemingly, it had root in that little book of Johnson Strangest of all, perhaps, was the effect the book had on Wesley Plunkett So fascinated was he with the weird record and its gems of wisdom, that he borrowed the book and kept it for two weeks.
When he returned it to his nephew he was a changed man.
As Doctor Alfred Mixinger had undeceived him regarding his health, so Johnson posthumous influence altered his whole conception of life.
Uncle Wes wanted to return the seventy-five thousand dollars to Whipple, declaring that he had given it in good faith and should not take it back.
But Whipple insisted that he had no right to the money, quoted Blue to support his argument, and refused flatly to accept it.
Although overruled on this point, Uncle Wes was like the Rock of Gibraltar in refusing to let his nephew make up any of the amount he had spent. wasnot to invest any of the hundred thousand, Uncle Wes,” argued Whipple, “but it seems that I did that unwittingly.
If Charley and I hadnot bought the aeroplane we should not have been cast away in Lost Creek Canon and should not have been able to recover the bank’s money or get the reward for capturing and his two pals.” standing pat,” growled Uncle Wes obstinately. book is a lesson for tightwads as well as for spendthrifts, and taking my lesson to heart.
From now on, by gorry, going to pay taxes, and every cent got goes into taxable bonds.
I owe that to a land that can produce a man like Johnson Blue.
Hereafter, going to live like a white man.
Get me? got my health, and going after some of the brightness and happiness Doctor Mixinger mentioned.
And there’s that Galusha Mingo investment, my boy; and then, the rest of it. the wedding? going to buy a present for that affair that will cost a wad of money. it to be?”
Here was something else again.
Uncle Wes referred to an event that happened when Whipple, coming out of the hills, stopped for a night at Jimmie cabin in Apache Draw.
Uncle Wes had to return the burro he had borrowed, a long-eared, camp-raiding pack animal who was called Handsome because he was so ugly.
Galusha Mingo and Katie were there, it will be remembered, and hence Whipple was very anxious to stop.
He was welcomed with open arms by Mingo, and with much happiness by Katie.
To both of them he recited the adventures that had followed his attempt to get to Los Angeles by aeroplane so that, aided and abetted by Concho Charley Vandeever, he could spend largely and acquire most for his money.
“What a blessing you were wrecked in a canon,” commented Galusha Mingo, “where you couldnot spend a cent “No; you are wrong, Mr. Mingo,” corrected Whipple; “the blessing came to me in the form of a book written by the late Johnson Blue.
But we’ll not discuss that.”
He finished his recital, Katie listening breathlessly.
“All very good,” approved Galusha Mingo.
“Capturing the robbers and recovering the money has caused you to get ahead in spite of yourself.
No doubt you have wondered about the ten thousand dollars which I pried out of you.
Well, tell about that.
Katie and I were worried to see you spending your money so foolishly, so we laid our plans to save some of it for you.
With the money you let me have, I bought an option on big brick block.
He was hard up and eager to sell, and my option called for a bargain and gave me thirty days for a turnover. didnot need the thirty days,” he continued.
“In just a week I disposed of the option for twenty thousand dollars, and I am holding the profit for you.
It would be a start, you see. want you to know, added Mingo earnestly, “that I didnot take that money for myself.
It was a plot of and mine to help you; and I had to draw on my psychology and proceed by indirection in order to be of any assistance to you.
Katie has worried about that, and the false position in which she has apparently placed herself.” talk that over,” said to Mingo.
“Suppose we take a walk down the draw, Katie he asked.
They took their walk and by a spring under a cottonwood tree they sat down, and Katie began to speak of Mamie and Lorena. want to tell you about Mamie and Lorena, Katie,” Whipple interrupted.
“If you will remember, I met those two girls at a party at your house.
You introduced me to them.
Whenever I came into town with a little money to spend, Mamie and Lorena were all for helping me get rid of it, while you were always asking me to put it in the bank or pay my debts.
“Well, you know, debts never bothered me much.
I was always for letting the other fellow worry.
Too free and easy, you understand, but with not a desire to beat anybody out of what was his just due.
I just couldnot seem to get the hang of that.
I wanted a lot, and thirty a week wonot go very far.
Your constant talk of saving rather jarred on me, so I turned to Mamie and Lorena.
There I made my big mistake.
That night I plunged with you to the extent of fifteen dollars and forty cents, and you called me down oh, very nicely for doing it I felt as though all the fun had been taken out of the evening.
But always, I want you to know, I had a thousand thoughts of Katie Mingo where I had one of Mamie or Lorena. how I felt, deep down in my heart.”
There was that in his eyes, at this moment, which brought a vivid flush to cheeks.
And when he took her hand she did not withdraw it. was worried, over there in Lost Creek Canon, Katie,” Whipple went on.
“You see, Johnson Blue, when he was a bookkeeper at a hundred a month, lost his heart to a girl named Ethel. the only part of her name that appears in his book.
Just ‘Ethel/ If I had the full name and address, go personally to tell Ethel what happened to Johnson Blue.
Well, when Blue got his million dollars from his uncle, and began having high jinks with it, it appears that Ethel reproved him for his spendthrift habits just as you reproved me, I imagine.
And Blue felt annoyed, and went his own way, and finally found himself a prisoner in Lost Creek Canon, with only eighteen cents in his pocket and the girl whom he loved married to a better man. what worried me, there in the canon, Katie.
What if you married a better man while I was reading Johnson Blue and seeing the error of my ways and making a firm resolution to be different if I ever got out of that pocket?
What if “Wesley,” said Katie softly, “it wasnot possible.”
“What wasnot possible?” demanded Whipple, a wild suspicion stabbing at his heart.
“Why,” answered Katie, her eyes lowered, “that I could marry a better man than than you!”
The wild suspicion that Katie might be pledged to another at once took wings.
“And will you marry me, Katie?” asked Whipple. have prospects now and, thanks to Johnson Blue, I can be all that your father would have me.
Katie, look up!
Tell me if I am going to be the happiest man that ever lived What Katie said it is not necessary to put down here for her answer stood revealed in that question of Uncle the wedding?”
Whipple, very joyfully, told him “when was” the wedding, and Uncle Wes shook his hand hard. the girl I had picked for you all along,” he averred.
“She hasnot been proud of Old Plunks in the past, I reckon, but that’s all going to be changed from now on.
And some day, j.,” he added earnestly, want you to take me to Lost Creek Canon.”
“What for?” asked Whipple curiously. want to put a ten-dollar wreath on the grave of Johnson Blue,” was the answer.
And that, to any one who had known the old Uncle Wes, was something for him to say.
