adrift in the unknown queer adventures in a queer realm by author of the special game in the web his friend the enemy etc seventh avenue new york splendid interesting big stories for the present the adventure library will be devoted to the publication of stories by william wallace cook
the fact that one man wrote all of these stories in no way detracts from their interest as they are all very different in plot and locality
for example the action in one story takes place in the land of little rain another deals with adventure on the high seas another is a good railroad story others are splendid western stories and some are mystery stories
all of them however are stories of vigorous adventure drawn true to life which gives them the thrill that all really good fiction should have

an uninvited guest professor feat the plutocrats reconciled traveling sunward a landing effected facing a mercurial storm the mercurials learning the wordbox how we were catalogued the dilemma of mr meigs condemned to death a threatening calamity plan to steal a building surveying our own planet how illluck overtook me a change of heart how we outwitted the king back to earth there could be no more fitting introduction to this most amazing narrative from the pen of james peter munn than that article in the morning mercury
munn it is no breach of confidence to inform the reader was a reformed burglar although the author of two books which achieved large sales and were most favorably received by the ways of cracking safes and the manualmr
munn developed small skill with the pen so that the breathless interest aroused by his revelations hangs more upon the matter than the style
the mercury article should do its mite toward preparing the reader for what is to come
in the first place the story was what newspaper men call a scoop
the article in the first edition ran as follows a a what happened to professor quinn last night
and what happened to the strange steel structure known locally among harlem residents as castle
for quinn and his castle were snuffed out like a candlegleam some time between the hours of eleven oclock and midnight
patrolman casey who travels a beat in that part of harlem avers that he passed the castle at eleven oclock and that it was there he passed its site again at twelve and it was not there
considerably exercised patrolman casey made search for the castle and although he beat up the country for a dozen blocks in all directions he failed to find it
and what is more patrolman casey declares that he took the pledge when he went on the force and has been a total abstainer ever since
corroboration of the officers report is not lacking
certain residents of the vicinity state that they saw the professors weird dwelling yesterday evening its windows were aglow and it appeared evident that the professor was entertaining friends
the first gray dawn this morning showed a bare lot with the steel house missing
is it another case of palace dissolving into thin air at the presto of some wonder worker
or is it a plain case of larceny undertaken on a gigantic scale
a golden opportunity offers itself to a sleuth of the sherlock holmes school and for such a person the mercury presents the following facts first the socalled castle was projectileshaped of boilerplate construction and measured some twenty feet in diameter tapering to a point thirty feet above ground
it was covered with a sort of paint that gave it the appearance of frosted silver
second there is much low shrubbery surrounding the site of the castle and if the castle had been blown down and rolled from the ridge it stood on into the river there would have been left evidences in plenty of such disaster
note the castle certainly weighed five tons possibly five times that
nothing short of a cyclone could have budged it and there was hardly a breath of air stirring the whole night long
third professor quinn ever since he erected his steel house and moved into it has been regarded as mildly insane
like he desired to be entered on the angelic scroll as one who loved his fellowmen
last summer he read before the astronomical society a paper entitled the mutability of newtonian law and was laughed out of that honorable body for his inconsistencies
although adverted to as the harlem sage professor quinn is no merlin nor does he possess the ring of gyges that rendered its wearer invisible
yet where is he
and where is his castle
until some vidocq appears and solves the mystery echo can only answer where
so much for the article in the first printing of the paper
the bright young man who stood sponsor for the scoop had meanwhile been very busy with fresh details and the second edition contained the following addenda it has just been learned that mr emmet gilhooly the multimillionaire and president of the railroad combine was a guest of professor quinn last night and must have been in the castle at the very moment it faded into oblivion
mr gilhooly did not return to his home and has not since been heard from
his relatives are distracted and leading railroad men of the country are in a panic
his absence from affairs at the present moment jeopardizes the traction interests of the entire country and may prove a deathblow to the success of the gigantic pool he was forming
this was startling news indeed and sped hither and yon throughout the city the country and the civilized world
appalling as the information was nevertheless it proved merely a fractional part of the truth
the bright reporter on the mercury made further discoveries which were printed in the third edition rushed from the presses of his paper
not only was mr emmet gilhooly a guest of professor quinn in the steel castle last night but so also were hon
augustus popham the coal baron archibald meigs of wall street late manipulator of the corner in wheat and now engineering a corner in cotton and hannibal markham well known as the instigator of a plot to control the food supply of the united states
what has become of these four millionaires and napoleons of finance
they have gone with quinn and his castle disappearing as utterly as though the earth had opened and swallowed them
fabulous rewards were offered by the relatives of the missing millionaires for any information relative to the fate that had overtaken them
foul play was suspected and the financial world stood aghast and dumbly wondered what was to happen to the business of the country if it really developed beyond all peradventure that gilhooly popham meigs and markham had been eliminated from commercial affairs
the influence of these four was vast and farreaching and they were scheming to make their grip on the republics resources even more secure and relentless
if their plans carried no man could eat or clothe himself or warm his body and drive his manufacturing engines or travel from place to place and ship the product of his mills without paying tribute to gilhooly popham meigs and markham
should those schemes titanic in conception be worked out to their manifest conclusion four men would hold the destiny of industrial america in the hollow of their hands
prosperity would wait upon their pleasure or at a mere nod would be paralyzed and leave the country stranded on the reefs of disaster
it seemed an odd fatality that at the very time these of industry were plotting to make their power complete they should have vanished as utterly as though they had been engulfed by a tidal wave and swept into the broad regions of the atlantic
a few facts were brought to light through the probing of skilled detective minds but these facts were in nowise clues to the fate that had overtaken the millionaires confidential aide reluctantly admitted that his chief had accepted an invitation from quinn and had gone to his castle for an interview
quinn professed to have made some discovery or other which he declared would make coal a useless commodity so far as human needs were concerned
popham while laughing at pretensions was nevertheless secretly worried
anything that threatened the success of the coup which was being engineered by himself and his three confreres was to be dealt with decisively and without loss of time
in the case of meigs markham and gilhooly there was no confidential aide to offer testimony for these bright particular stars of high finance had placed a limit on the confidence reposed in their secretaries
nevertheless the probing minds at work on the case developed the extraordinary fact that these men no less than popham had visited quinn at the latters request
a spirit of scoffing investigation animated them but they were prepared to see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears whatever quinn had to show and to say
if anything that militated against their projected coup was brought before them they would proceed to lay the spectre forthwith
strangely enough the shrewdest of the detectives failed to connect the disappearance of the millionaires with the comprehensive plans they were forming and which could not be carried out except by the plotters in person
other rich men of the country who were wont to trim their sails in accordance with whatever wind blew from the offices of the four in wall street were already shifting affairs to lay a course that would give them the best headway against the projected new order
this sudden disappearance of the powers to which the lesser rich looked for guidance left them becalmed in an uncharted sea
the middle class long accustomed to being mulcted right and left accepted the astonishing situation with equanimity
so far as they were concerned gilhooly popham meigs and markham were abstract generalitiesmerely names to conjure with
for years the middle class had paid for the conjuring and had been taught to look calmly into the eyes of what they had come to believe was the inevitable
if their annual outing to the seashore or the mountains cost too much they could stay at home if the butcher the baker and the grocer ran prices too high some of the luxuries could be cut out if anthracite went to a ton they would heat fewer rooms and if clothing became too expensive there would be fewer suits and gowns to wear
by a little selfdenial the middle class also could trim their sails to any gale that blew
they were used to it
with the poor it was different
they were already down to bedrock in the way of selfdenial
no sooner had it drifted through their brains that the influence of gilhooly popham meigs and markham had been blotted out than they lifted their voices in praise of the blessed event
their situation had been bad enough and any change among the vaguely understood causes presiding over their affairs could hardly be for the worse
the detectives feeling that they were at work on a particularly complex case hampered themselves by looking for complex causes
at first they believed it was a matter of sequestration and that presently a ransom in seven or eight figures would be called for
however a delving into past failed to reveal any lawless actions that would point to a ransom in his present line of endeavor
the detectives growing more complex as the ambiguities closed them in overlooked entirely the simplicity of character
anyhow one analytical mind would demand of another what had intentions to do with the disappearance
that was a positive reality
and although it was surmised it was not definitely known that quinn himself had had anything to do with it
such was the situation confronting the country and with which the police department of new york city was called upon to deal
but the keenest reasoning inductive or deductive was powerless to find even a clue
the tremendous mystery might have remained a mystery until this day had it not been for the narrative of james peter munn now for the first time given to the world
i used to be one of those who claimed that the world owed him a living and i went out with a drill and a jimmy to collect it
where was the difference i argued between the man who cracks your strong box and removes a few paltry bills or coins and the nabob who skulks behind a trust and takes his tax on the necessities of life
this was pure sophistry of course but i became wedded to it in early life and that i escaped a suit of stripes and measurement on the bertillon system is due entirely to my experiences with professor quinn
twas a blessed night that sent me to his castle with the view of mulcting it of treasures i felt to be there
quinn was a queer one
i do not mean to say that he was unhinged as some thought but he was queer in his outlook upon life and in resources which fall under the head of ways and means
his castle claimed my professional attention
for why should a man build a big steel vault and live in it unless he had portable property worth a burglars while
i reconnoitered the place for a week before i considered myself possessed of sufficient knowledge for my undertaking
in view of what transpired at the time of my visit a brief description of the castle taken from my memorandum book will prove of interest
the structure was cigarshaped twentynine feet from base to apex and twenty feet in diameter through its largest part
it was divided into two stories by means of a steel floor leaving headroom of ten feet in the lower story
four windows pierced the circular walls of the nether room and two gave light to the room above these six openings being guarded on the outer sides with latticework of steel
the door was an oblong piece of boiler platethe entire building was a shell composed of plates riveted togetherhinged heavily and provided with a strong lock
as i had yet to find a lock which i could not pick if given time enough my designs naturally centred about the door
i had hit upon the somewhat early hour of ten in the evening for my call at the professors
unless business kept him abroad i knew that he was usually in bed long before that time
if he chanced to be out so much the better for the success of my foray
after the patrolman had passed i crept through the bushes and was soon busy with the lock on the steel door
it yielded with much less resistance than i had anticipated and i was quickly within flashing my lantern about me
a circular seat upholstered in leather ran around the wall and a table bearing an unlighted oil lamp stood in the centre of the floor
i had barely completed a hasty survey when a crunch of footsteps on the graveled walk without smote on my ears
without loss of a moment i snapped the lantern shut and darted up the iron stairway to the room above
it is needless to say that i was very much put out because of the interruption
i was a hard man in those days and such an occurrence was apt to anger me and make me say things
lying flat on the floor with my face to the stair opening i had a fairly good view of the circular chamber below
the professor had been abroad and not in bed for he appeared now ushering in callers
four gentlemen all of distinguished mien and important bearing followed the owner of the castle and began glancing about with illconcealed amusement
gad but this is an odd place exclaimed one
this gentleman wore a frock coat and silk hat but what caught my eye was a fourcarat spark in his scarf a massive seal on his fob and a scintillating gem on the third finger of his left hand
odd perhaps returned the professor but most suitable to my purposes mr gilhooly as i hope to show you before many minutes have passed
be seated sir
and the rest of you gentlemen you will find the divan most comfortable
gilhooly
i went hot and cold at that name
nearly everybody in new york was just then talking about the man who was scheming to make railroad travel too expensive for ordinary mortals
he was a millionaire several times over and in the breast of his frock coat i knew there must be a bulky wallet
at once and while i watched and listened to those in the room below my mind busied itself with details of a more comprehensive operation than i had at first contemplated
the professors four guests had seated themselves on the circular divan
after my eyes had finished with gilhooly they turned on the other three and my first impressions were more than confirmed
each of the quartet was a croesus and dressed and strutted the part
fine birds indeed and i hugged myself to think how opportunity had come knocking at my door in hand i could descend upon this covey compel a readjustment of values between them and myself then back through the steel door lock it behind me and make off
the professor intent on other things no doubt had turned his key in the lock and had failed to discover that the bolt was already thrown therefore my presence in the castle was entirely unsuspectedmanifestly an advantage
you have asked us to come here professor quinn spoke up one as the professor turned higher the wick of the lamp he had just lighted and here we are
you say you have discovered something whose value to science and the industrial world is beyond compute and that you wish to interest capital the speaker surveyed his three companions with a large is the capital shall come at my discovery in due course mr popham said the professor who was a wiry little man with a bald head and beadlike black eyes thank you for coming here
emmet gilhooly augustus popham archibald meigs and hannibal markham are stars of the first magnitude in the skies of speculation and i esteem myself fortunate in arousing their interest
a faintness seized me as these names each an open sesame to the world of finance fell glibly from the professors tongue
i was all but cheek by jowl with representatives of billions
augustus popham turned his head to give emmet gilhooly a plebeian wink
gilhooly smiled behind his smooth white hand
archibald meigs leaned over to whisper something to hannibal markham who was affixing a pair of gold eyeglasses to his roman nose whereupon both gentlemen suppressed a titter
a doubt of the sincerity of all four broke over me
they were there to have sport with this bald little man with the beady eyes and the bee in his bonnet
i chuckled grimly as i thought of how the tables would presently be turned
i do not know whether the professor was as keen as i to detect these evidences of insincerity
if he was he gave no sign am sixtyfive said he and my life work has been the discovery which i am about to bring to your august attention
perhaps some of you gentlemen have read my paper on the mutability of newtonian law
the gentlemen acknowledged that they had not
professor quinn seemed disappointed
if you had read that he continued you would have prepared yourselves for an understanding of my theory and the demonstration of it which i am about to give
let me ask you this when an apple leaves its parent branch why is it that it falls downward instead of upward
the napoleons of finance stared at one another
archibald meigs went so far as to tap a suggestive finger against his forehead
gravity said the professor
it is that which draws every atom on the surface of the earth directly toward the earths centre it is that which chains our feet to this planet and keeps us from falling through interstellar space it is even that which keeps our little world from flying apart and dissipating itself in dust throughout the great void
it is a simple proposition simply stated and i trust you follow me
they did follow him and so signified
in the paper i read before the astronomical society pursued the professor made bold to declare that it was possible to insulate a body against the force of gravitation
in other words to make it so immune from newtonian law that it would spurn the earth and fall from it at a speed even greater than the drawing power of gravity
can you not comprehend what this means cried quinn waxing eloquent
it means a new force in the industrial worlda power that feeds on nothing save a law that transcends that of gravitation
in point of fact it falls little short of perpetual motion
without the expenditure of even a pound of coal this new force can turn the wheels of every railroad train on the globe
with its own inherent energy it can give life to the machinery of flour mills cotton mills iron foundries it can augustus popham got up hurriedly and put on his hat rattlebrained idea sir he exclaimed have no mind to remain here and listen to such talk coal mines ravaged the earths crust in a thousand and one places
the idea that human industry could get along without his coal was too much for him
before he could reach the door professor quinn was in front of him barring his way
remember mr popham said the professor if i were to take away your mines i should yet give you something in their place worth incalculably more
hear me out sir
i beg of you
theories are cheap things muttered popham as he again seated himself
an ounce of proof is worth a pound of theory
exactly cried quinn and the ounce of proof shall be forthcoming
with that he pulled the table from the centre of the room revealing an iron chain some three feet in length attached at its lower end to a staple in the floor by means of a clevis and pin
the chain was not lying loosely but was rigidly upright its upper end wound about a white blocka sixinch cube as i judged
climbing to the table top the professor stepped thence to the cube poising himself for a moment on one foot
then he sprang to the floor again
this cube he explained laying one hand on the block with an affectionate gesture is of steel and has been treated with my insulating compound
to all appearance it is falling upward with a force sufficient to draw the chain rigidly to its full extent and to support my weight
poppycock muttered the coal baron trick exclaimed meigs
the other two remained silent
they were bewildered perhaps impressed
let us see whether it is a trick or no went on quinn
pray come forward gentlemen and lay hold of the chain
there is no danger in the little experiment with which i am going to amuse you and i think it will dispel your doubts
the gentlemen hesitated but finally came forward got down with some difficulty and grasped the chain as directed
hold tight exclaimed the professor and drew the pin from the clevis
thus released the cube rose to the ceiling lifting the four gentlemen with it
they hung in midair until quinn drew the table under them and they dropped to its top each in turn and so reached the floor
bewilderment was written large in the faces of the quartet their credulity struggling against the evidence of their senses
you are a good magician sir averred popham brushing the damp from his forehead with a handkerchief
you could make your fortune as an entertainer declared gilhooly
archibald meigs chewed briskly on an unlighted cigar while hannibal markham kept his eyes on the cube and dangling chain like one fascinated
it is the fate of a man who makes startling discoveries to be classed among disciples in black art observed quinn calmly
what is the hour mr gilhooly he asked
the head of the railway pool consulted his repeater he replied
and high time i was going added popham
just a few moments more said the professor
turning to the wall behind him he caught a small lever and turned it over as far as it would go
the castle vibrated slightly communicating a perceptible swaying motion to the pendent chain this cried markham jumping up
do not be alarmed my friends cried quinn whirling around
his face was pallid as death and his beady eyes gleamed like coals
then wonder of wonders the white cube settled to the floor
ha shouted popham
your antigravity compound is not very long lived it seems to me
you will find differently to your cost returned the professor through his teeth
augustus popham kenward quinn arraign you and emmet gilhooly and archibald meigs and hannibal markham as foes of the human race
you are leeches who would suck the lifeblood from the veins of the poor with steady forefinger quinn had transfixed each of the plutocrats as he called his name
markham was already on his feet and the other three were not slow in following him this whats this gasped gilhooly
an insult muttered popham
the old addlepate is not accountable for what he says or does remarked archibald meigs
we had best leave this steel trap of his while there is yet time counseled markham
while there is yet time repeated quinn with a wild laugh pretty set of conspirators you are on my soul
markham there would raise the price of food until the poor would go hungry you meigs would so manipulate the cost of clothing that they would not have the wherewithal to cover their nakedness popham would make fuel a luxury of the rich and gilhooly would so boost passenger and freight rates as to quadruple to the consumer the tremendous cost of the necessities of life
deny me if you can if you dare
quinn looked like a nemesis as he confronted the four men and lashed them with his scorpion whip of words
fiddlededee exclaimed popham
we deserve it said meigs for it was the height of folly for us to come here in the first place
is this why you brought us here asked markham to air your own particular ideas on sociology and to make us the victims of your abuse
the professor threw back his head and straightened his shoulders
it was the real thing in dignity that he showed those plutocrats and my nerves tingled with admiration
i was sorry i had come to the castle with designs oh portable property and doubly glad that i could force tribute from these four who were badgering him am not unjust averred the professor and such a thing as abuse is farthest from my mind but i love the plain people the bone and sinew of this glorious republic and it arouses my indignation when the right to live and let live is trampled upon by any one man or set of men
platitudes sneered popham
to call a truth a platitude is witless argument answered quinn serenely
be that as it may said meigs we were not invited here for a debate but to witness a demonstration of what you were pleased to term a revolutionizing discovery
you have seen me overcome the force of gravity went on the professor and to astute minds like yours further explanation seems uncalled for
in destroying gravity i produce a power equalled by no other force in the world
the pull of an insulated block the size of that here he waved his hand toward the equal to the strength of a hundred horses
develop that pull horizontally instead of vertically and we have a locomotive that runs continuously without the consumption of a pound of coal
that cried the professor his voice ringing with triumph is the apotheosis of power
gilhooly judging from his manner was the victim of uncomfortable thoughts meigs wore a startled look and markham seemed half convinced
popham alone was brusque and uncompromising think we had better get out of here again suggested markham
his half convictions appeared to arouse some small amount of apprehension of the same opinion spoke up meigs
wait a little suggested popham and i saw a gleam in his eyes that meant a stroke of some kind
once more he faced quinn have no patience with your harebrained theories he went on and i have seen charlatans work greater wonders than what you are pleased to call your demonstration
but it is a business principle of mine to buy up these promising theories if they happen to run counter to any pet scheme i am trying to put through
sir rather than be annoyed further with this chimerical idea of yours i will pay five thousand dollars spot cash just to have you give over your notions and quit experimenting
professor quinn laughed
five thousand dollars he exclaimed then added as though to himself he would have me sell the welfare and happiness of the people for five thousand dollars will add another five thousand to offer put in gilhooly not because i am afraid your discoveries will upset the transportation interests of the country but simply to clear the commercial atmosphere and keep your visionary ideas from affecting the price of stocks
let me add another five thousand said meigs donot see how your invention even if it is all you claim for it could affect me or my interests one way or the other but i will add my contribution simply because popham has taken the initiative
count me in for the same amount supplemented markham on the condition that professor quinn signs over to the four of us all his right title and interest in his nongravity invention and covenants to leave that field entirely alone in future
quinn seemed to enjoy these propositions and it was apparent at a glance that he had no intention of accepting twenty thousand dollars and renouncing his discoveries
gentlemen said he you are already half convinced that i am no dreamer for you are financiers and while twenty thousand dollars is no more to you than twenty cents is to me it is not your habit to give your money away
i repeat that you are inclined to have faith in me and before many minutes i shall have made your belief in my abilities complete
am i to understand that you decline our offer demanded popham
most decidedly
then there is nothing more to be said
come on gentlemen and popham started toward the door moment more if you please requested the professor
not another second cried popham
our offer is withdrawn and if your socalled discoveries amount to anything we shall find other means for making them ineffective
i had been interested in proceedings to an extent that had all but caused me to forget my purpose
the plutocrats were about to leave the castle in a temper and if i wrested tribute from them it must be now or never
starting up i drew my revolver and ran hastily down the iron stairs
my unexpected advent upon the scene proved as startling as i had anticipated
even the professor was dashed
stepping in front of the steel door i toyed menacingly with the revolver and surveyed the plutocrats with a grim humor i made no attempt to conceal
at that period of my life inspired by the sophistry to which i have already adverted i was a cool and dangerous man
pardon me for entering unannounced said i blindly
you have listened to professor theory and witnessed its demonstration
i am but an humble philosopher yet i have a theory of my own which i should also like to expound and to demonstrate
who are you sir demanded quinn am a bird of like feather with these your guests said i facetiously albeit my methods are more direct if less extensive
my name is james peter munn my specialty is robbery of the variety for i have the courage of my convictions and do not hide behind a technicality do not wish to intrude my presence here longer than necessary to accomplish my designs and if these amiable gentlemen will aid indicated the amiable gentlemen with my revolver will take my departure quietly from the castle here i scowled trust or other will be minus its guiding power in case any resistance is attempted
the threat was sufficient and the usual sunny smile returned to my face as i added mr gilhooly will advance to the table spread his handkerchief upon it and lay thereon his watch and fob the ring on his finger the kohinoor in his tie and the wallet in the breast of his coat
it is my theory that one thief has the right to take from another property that does not belong to either of them
it is mr privilege to give the first demonstration
fidelity to truth forces me to chronicle the above speech
the clat with which i made it is far from me now as i pen it verbatim
there are speeches in life which we could wish unsaid and this one of mine i would give much to consign to the limbo of things unspoken
reformation has worked wonders in me since that evil time
i will say for mr gilhooly that he was alacrity itself in carrying out my command
his hands trembled a little as he placed his belongings on the handkerchief and knotted the four corners over the plunder as i requested
the professor smiling strangely sank down on the divan and watched proceedings with twinkling eyes
his manner filled me with a foreboding i tried not to manifest
evidently this amuses you cried gilhooly in anger his snapping eyes on the professor
your inference is correct mr gilhooly answered quinn am profoundly amused
it is all so unexpected so dramatic and souseless
by gad sir cried popham see more in this than a desire on your part to interest capital in a fake discovery
there is a plot here gentlemen and he turned to the other three
our folly in allowing ourselves to be lured to this place was stupendous
i make no doubt but that there is a plot here between this man quinn and this thief
quinn gets us in the thiefs power and the thief does the rest pretty scheme snapped meigs
clever very clever put in markham
and successful too growled gilhooly with a regretful look at the plunder on the table
but there will be a reckoning
when we are once clear of this place we can set the police at work
i was surprised at the way quinn took this talk
he continued to smile and was in no way ruffled wrong there cried hot and indignant
professor quinn had nothing to do with my being here had my eye on this castle for a long while and i let myself in just before you came hoping to make a haul and get clear
you interrupted me and i stowed myself away upstairs
from what i saw and heard i must say that it is a pleasure for me to turn my back on professor property and to give my entire attention to you four
mr munn said quinn how long have you been engaged in this business
for some years now sir i answered
you were honestonce
every man is born honest if it comes to that
i used to work in an iron foundry but the works were taken over by a combination and a lot of us were thrown out of employment
there was nothing for me to do but begand above that
this came handiest and i went into it
i like the business
matching ones wits against the law keeps one constantly in the midst of alarms so to speak and i like excitement
and i have ability for never yet have i worn the stripes or learned the lockstep
i have written some on the subject of my vocation in the hope of beguiling others into the work dangerous man muttered gilhooly
what are we coming to clamored popham
here is a thief who is actually proud of his profession and who actually writes books about it
merciful heavens gasped meigs in horror feel sorry for my country when it produces such men are tottering on the verge of chaos added markham in a stage whisper
i laughed at all this for i enjoyed it hugely
spare yourselves any needless worry about me gentlemen said look to home and you will probably find enough there to fret your consciences
professor quinn continued to take pleasure out of the queer situation can honor a man like munn said he where i am tempted to despise men like you gilhooly meigs markham and popham
as munn said he has the courage of his convictions
he does not take from the poor for in the very nature of things he cannot
his loot comes from those who are able to lose it while you are vampires and sapping the very lifeblood of the nation
you are all criminally deluded although perhaps doing what you conscientiously believe to be exactly right
would to heaven and here the professor grew suddenly sincere and intensely earnest that something would conspire to open your eyes to the exact truth
but i have despaired of that and i am trying in my own feeble way to meet the present emergency
you are either a fool or a madman cried popham rattlebrained zealot chimed in meigs
you are the one who should see things differently said markham
you preach a doctrine which you fail to apply personally
enough of this talk gentlemen i interposed
my situation is precarious and i must ask you to hurry a little
sir shouted popham leveling a forefinger at me shall see you properly jailed for this
why you miserable footpad i can save your breath i interrupted tartly meeting his forefinger with the muzzle of the pepper box
lead is no respecter of persons
one of you has called me a dangerous man
i am all of that and desperate
mr popham you saw how mr gilhooly carried out my orders
you will proceed in the same manner and without further loss of time
in five minutes i must be out of here
he started to argue the point with me and i allowed my forefinger to flex ever so slightly upon the trigger
that was enough
a man values his life in a direct ratio with what he considers his importance therefore the esteem in which these four millionaires held themselves must have been overwhelming
the honorable augustus popham finally yielded up his personal property with the same readiness that had characterized his friend
hannibal markham followed him and after markham came archibald meigs
i had a pleasant word for each as i marshaled the four bundles strung them on the fingers of my left hand and backed toward the door which was a few paces behind me
when a good general beats a retreat said preparing to pull open the door and let myself out he places as many obstacles in the path of the pursuing force as possible
when i leave therefore i shall lock this door on the outside
i was watched by the plutocrats in philosophical silence by the professor with a geniality that nothing seemed able to shake
i had spared quinn because he was a friend of the poor as i had discovered
and i had been poor myself some fifteen minutes back said i airily
au revoir answered the professor
look well where you step
i threw open the door with a laugh
the laugh faded into a shout of terror
i threw out my hands revolver and packets of loot falling through the door and i only barely saving myself with one foot over the threshold
the horror that gripped me then is such a horror as comes to a man but once in a lifetime
my brain sickened and chilled my heart all but stopped its beating and my limbs grew rigid
in the black of the fearsome nightnot the atmospheric blueblack i had been accustomed to but the ebony dark of erebusi saw a wild greenish star below a huge disk whose gleaming nimbus danced on my sight in quivering lines
half crazed i flung back into the room and fell groveling to the floor my ears echoing with the professors merriment and the startled exclamations of the four men i had robbedall to no purpose
presently i sat up rubbing forehead and eyes
the professor stood in the open door gloating over the vista below
come he called beckoning to the huddled quartet at the other side of the room
come gilhooly meigs popham and look down upon the scene of your feverish activities
you were plutocrats there more powerful than kings
here you are no more than shoulder high with me and yon muddled thief on the floor
you have been snatched from the scene of your pernicious laborsexiled into planetary space where you will be powerless to work further evil
i have not lived in vain for this this is the triumph of my career
slowly meigs disentangled himself from the mute group by the opposite wall and crept on all fours to the threshold that overlooked the void and the greenish star
he recoiled with a yell then maddened by what he had seen he leaped erect and tried to hurl himself out into space
fool cried the professor laying hold of him and struggling to keep him back
would you become a satellite of this planet
we are beyond the atmosphere of the earthlook
see the four packets of loot and the thiefs revolver
he pointed through the door and the bulging handkerchiefs and my sixshooter were abreast of us hanging in space turning slowly weirdlya sight to upset the strongest mind
gilhooly jumped forward gave vent to a maniacal laugh then crumpled down on the floor
bid up for the he mumbled bid to the limit
i must have that will have it
brace up meigs said the professor sharply pulling the key from the outer side of the lock slamming the door fastening it and putting the key in his pocket
take care of gilhooly man
his mind falters
heavens are you all mad
are your keen minds unshaken in the contemplation of vast deals for the enslavement of the poor so quick to break
i had thought better of you than this
meigs white as the spotless linen that covered his breast advanced upon the professor
he tried to speak but without success
at last with a supreme effort the words came madman what have you done
that is better returned the professor smiling as he looked at meigs and noted how markham and popham ranged themselves at his side much better
you were engaged in plots back there on the earth and the success of those plots would have proved a great calamity
i have saved the world from the calamity castle has risen from the earth asked meigs
it has fallen off the earth
as you and i and the others happened to be inside we fell with it
sudden rage convulsed meigs
he crouched downward his eyes ablaze and his fingers working convulsively
scoundrel he screamed and launched himself at the professors throat like a tiger
looking back now at that dreadful hour when the realization of our awful predicament burst upon us i wonder that i preserved my own equilibrium
the first shock came near to throwing me off my poise but after that i gained the whip hand of my wits by swift and sure degrees
i verily believe the professor would have been strangled by meigs aided and abetted by popham and markham had i not rushed to his rescue
i had muscles of iron and after i had caught meigs by the nape of the neck and thrown him backward i planted myself between quinn and his foes
leave the professor alone said you men show mighty poor judgment it strikes me in trying to lay violent hands on him
he deserves death babbled meigs
he had no business shooting us into space in this summary manner
fear and anger had made meigs childish
he measured our dilemma in terms so common a smile came to my lips
judgment poor judgment sniffed popham
look at gilhooly and then talk about poor judgment if you can
in truth the railway magnate presented a sorry spectacle
his clothing was in wild disorder his hair was rumpled about his head and he was hopping back and forth with two fingers in the air
he was under the impression that he was dealing in railroad stocks completing the huge transaction that had made him the talk of two continents
this professor ought to be flayed alive declared markham
where are we going and when will we get there
now said you are striking the keynote
who knows where we are going if the professor doesnot
and who knows when we shall arrive there if it is out of his power to tell
we need the professor for if we are to be saved it will be his knowledge that does it
but what will my family think whimpered meigs
and my business interests
he threw up his hands and fell back in his seat with a groan
then abruptly he straightened up again
this is a dream
by gad it must be
the whole affair is too outrageously unreal for any sane man to believe
gilhooly gave a maudlin chuckle was dead sure get that last block of stock
that road is the last span in my network of ties and rails
ha
now well see
now meigs shivered maunderings struck sharply at his desire to coddle himself with a myth awful to have gilhooly like that spoke up augustus popham
if he had not been thrown out of balance his wide knowledge of matters relating to transportation might have proved of inestimable service to us now
professor quinn laughed
it was an eerie laugh and it shook me to hear it
oh you cried markham reproachfully whirling on quinn
after causing this disaster and overthrowing as brilliant a mind as there ever was in wall street you have the heart to indulge in levity
look here how far are we from the earth at the present moment
that is a difficult matter to estimate even approximately answered quinn calmly
ordinarily gravity exerts a force that can be measured definitely on the earths surface
a body falling freely from rest acquires a velocity which is equal to the product of thirtytwo and onefifth feet and the number of seconds during which the motion has lasted
what is the time now
three gentlemen reached for their watches failed to find them and turned hard looks on me
i appreciated their dilemma and drew from my vest an openface timepiece that was personal property and honestly come by
it is twelvefifteen said quinn took a pencil and notebook from his pocket and did some figuring
we might be a little more than two miles from our native planet said he but only two miles cried the three exiles in chorus
you can take us back sir said popham who had been pacing the floor nervously
shut off the power of this infernal machine and let us drop back to where we belong
two miles is no great matter
your castle is a slow freight compared with some of express trains cannot take you back sir returned the professor and i would not if i could
you did not hear me out
the law of velocity recited for your benefit a moment ago does not measure the speed of this car
no murmured markham
decidedly not
the earth sweeps along in its orbit at the rate of eighteen miles to the second while some aerolites and meteoroids attain a speed of twenty and thirty miles to the second
in building this car i equipped it with an antigravity block geared up to fifty miles to the second
the lever on the here quinn turned and pointed to thrown so as to give us the maximum
in other words said popham feebly we are sailing skyward at a rate ofof three thousand miles perper minute
presumably
as we left my city lot in new york at about elevenfifteen it follows that we have been one hour on the way
and should be one hundred and eighty thousand miles from home faltered meigs
about that answered the professor calmly do not know just how much our progress was impeded by the atmospheric envelope of the earth but i think we may call our distance from the mother orb some one hundred and eighty thousand miles in round numbers
these startling figures came near to unsettling the three gentlemen again
in that flight through space we were confronting immensities wellnigh beyond our puny comprehension
and the professor was not yet done
in the storeroom overhead he continued have a supply of cubes and insulating compound which i can combine and give tremendous added velocity to the car am sure we are traveling fast enough said meigs leaning back on the divan hopelessly dejected
if you are now ready to listen to reason proceeded quinn will tell you how mr munn here saved your lives by rescuing me from your mad attack
our lives forsooth exclaimed markham bitterly
of what value is life to us situated as we are
that is one way to look at it of course rejoined quinn caustically
but i did not exile you into planetary space for the purpose of wiping you out of existence
you might as well have done so said popham severely
that is what this harumscarum plot of yours amounts to in the long run
you may not care to learn how i am preserving you at the present moment continued quinn nor how i shall do so in the future yet i will tell you so that you may understand how much you owe to mr foresight and courage
i was beginning to entertain a high regard for quinn in spite of what he had done
he may have been laboring under terrible delusions but his resource certainly commanded respect
to my forethought he continued is due the fact that you are breathing oxygen at this moment and had i not invented a liquid which fortifies animate or inanimate bodies against heat and cold our rush through the atmosphere of the earth would have incinerated this car and its contentsnay would have caused it to explode and settle back on our native planet in impalpable powder
these were things that none of us aside from the professor had so much as taken thought of
my respect for him was growing into something like awe and i fancied i detected traces of the same sentiment in the other three
there are roving bodies in space quinn went on noting with apparent satisfaction the interest he had aroused with which we might come into collision
i have a good telescope at the observatory window upstairs and while i cannot guide this car i can at least increase or slacken its speed so as to dodge any other derelict that may come into dangerous proximity with us you better be up there on the lookout queried markham in some trepidation
he was manifesting an interest in his personal safety that pleased the professor
there is not much danger at present returned quinn
when we have plunged farther into the interstellar void it will be well to stand watch and watch about at the telescope
will it not be possible to land on some other planet mars for instance queried popham with sudden hope should prefer mars added meigs reflecting the hope shown in his friends face
they have been signaling from mars and perhaps we can find out what they want over there
quinn shook his head
we are in the hands of fate gentlemen said he
we may drop into some port but what that port will be is beyond my power even to surmise
the moon isnot so far off suggested markham
only two hundred and forty thousand miles said quinn
we should be there in less than two hours from the time of starting remarked meigs after a mental bout with the figures
if i wished said quinn could increase our speed traveling at the rate we are however something will have to be deducted for the resistance of the earths atmosphere
if we drop on a planet it must be a planet with an atmosphere
the moon has none and consequently is a dead world
besides fate might not throw us into its vicinity or just a minute sir interposed markham for i am a man who likes to understand thoroughly every situation with which he is called upon to deal
you invited us to your castle not i am constrained to believe to have us victimized by munn here nor to have us invest in any of your discoveries but to snatch us away from the scene of our labors
is that correct professor quinn
entirely so mr markham replied quinn
evidently proceeded markham your plot has cost you some time and labor
you had first to find your gravityresisting compound the plot followed as a result of my discovery smiled the professor did not first evolve the plot and then go searching for means to get you off the earth
when i had made the discovery it remained for me to give it to the worldor to better the world by taking you four gentlemen away from it
had i given the public the benefit you shrewd men of affairs might have devised means for setting it aside or for controlling it
not being a business man myself i feared to take chances
for that reason the present enterprise appealed to me
you have planned so well in the smaller details that i wonder you overlooked the main point
and that is what you are going to do with us now that your plan has succeeded
the professor tossed his hands deprecatingly as though that was really the most insignificant part of his startling scheme
we canot go bobbing around through interstellar space grumbled popham donot relish the idea of being cribbed cabined and confined in a steel room indefinitely
i should go mad from the very thought awful to contemplate said meigs casting a melancholy glance through the iron latticework at one of the windows
the bags of loot were in that vicinity at the moment and his glance swerved reproachfully to me
we shall make a landing i have no doubt said the professor soothingly somehow and somewhere
by gad sir cried popham bringing his fist emphatically down on the table donot like such a way of doing things
whenever i set out to accomplish anything the goal is always clear in my mind yet here i am through no desire of my own afloat in the great void without a single aim or a remote prospect
if we are going to land anywhereand you remain firm in your decision not to take us back to our native demand that you make landfall on some orb that is worth while
very good popham approved meigs
unless i am greatly mistaken that was the very idea markham had in mind when he began questioning the professor
eh markham
it was replied markham full knowledge of where we are going is necessary to a thorough understanding of remarkable situation
now there are worlds larger than the one we have recently left
personally i am predisposed in favor of a large planetone on which there are traction interests fuel supplies and products of the soil similar to those we have been accustomed to
under the spell of words popham began to glow and expand
meigs all attention pressed a little closer
the bigger the planet the bigger our field of operations cried popham the matter with jupiter
or saturn echoed meigs
or neptune put in markham the matter with the whole solar system inquired quinn with gentle irony
he turned to me
observe mr munn how extravagant are the ideas inspired by monopoly
these gentlemen are hardly started on their journey into space before they forget the business interests the friends and the environment they are leaving behind and begin planning the commercial conquest of the stars
he shook his head forebodingly
your regeneration he added to the millionaires calls for a landing on some barren world some outcast of the solar system where you will have nothing to do but think over the evil of your past and learn something of the duty you owe your fellowmen
popham markham and meigs were visibly annoyed by the professors remarks
withdrawing as far as the limits of the steel structure would allow they put their heads together and held a brief but animated conversation in tones so low that the professor and i could not overhear
think of that professor
i muttered
and yet there are people who find fault with a respectable burglar
softly mr munn returned quinn
before we are done with this journey i am fain to believe that all of you will have a different outlook upon life and a higher regard for your duties of citizenship
just then popham turned from his friends and stepped toward the professor
his manner was truculentprobably just such a manner as he was accustomed to use in facing a board of obstinate directors
if you will not return us to our native planet professor quinn said he sharply then we shall stand upon our rights
we are unalterably opposed to landing upon any orb whose diameter measures less than at that instant a most astounding thing happened
the car ducked sideways throwing the whole structure out of plumb
loose articles began to drop from shelves and other places and to slide across the floor to the lowest point
by a quick movement i saved the lamp and braced myself in an upright position
cries of terror went up from markham meigs and popham
gilhooly shouted the professor
he was answered by a wild yell from overhead in the storeroom cried quinn
follow me with that lamp the professor rushed for the stairway and i made after him with what speed i could
there never lived a man i suppose who did not at some time or other in his career submit his veracity to question
a reformed burglar therefore although animated by the most disinterested motives can scarcely hope to escape the shafts of the incredulous
although wellgrounded in the science of cracksmanship and with some store of legal learning as to alibis and so forth my mind was as empty of astronomical lore as a drained bottle
the professors sayings were jotted down in a sort of commonplace book at a later day when leisure offered
memory may have played me false in some few minor points but in all of major importance this narrative is to be taken with the same sincerity in which it is written
i ask no more of the reader than that and if he is not averse to strolling through unfrequented ways touching elbows with a man who has a past we shall get along famously
to return then to the steel car and the obliquity it suddenly presented to the direction of its course
startling disclosures had somewhat obscured gilhooly and he had vanished from the lower room without being missed
for a man of sixtyfive the professor was very agile and he took the winding iron stairway two steps at a time
i gained the storeroom close behind him and there we found gilhooly crooning to himself and working like mad
he was not working in the dark but had possessed himself of my lantern which i had left on descending from the loft some time before
mounted on a pile of packing cases he was engaged in painting a large steel cube taking his pigment from an open cask with a whitewash brush
my antigravity compound exclaimed the professor in an irritated tone
there are several blocks on the floor as you can see gilhooly began painting that one and it rose as insulation proceeded lodging to the left of the dome and tilted the car
this is the shabbiest lot of coaches i ever saw in my life said gilhooly dabbing away with the brush wonot own a road with such rolling stock
the three men downstairs had followed quinn and me
after some coaxing meigs got gilhooly to descend from his perch and give up the whitewash brush
thereupon the cube was pried over until it rested directly under another block in the point of the dome and the professor finished the insulation begun by the railway magnate
gilhooly will have to be watched said quinn or he will play havoc with the materials i have stored up here
he has wasted at least a quart of that antigravity mixture and it is worth its weight in gold
nay it is worth more than that for after this supply is exhausted there will be none to be had for love or money
our rate of speed has been multiplied by two and we are rushing through space with frightful rapidity
there is my the professor pointed to the instrument which stood beneath a window in the sloping roof of the car
suppose gilhooly had demolished that
or what if he had wrecked the oxygen vat or the antitemperature reservoir
gentlemen i shudder to think of what might have happened
the professor sank down on a copper tank and brushed his perspiring brow with a bandanna handkerchief
i placed the lamp on a box beside the lantern and reclined on a bale of something or other that lay conveniently near
meigs and popham dropped down on a packing case with gilhooly moored between them and markham took up his station on an overturned cask
the loft of the car stored as it was with odds and ends of science together with a supply of provisions made ready for us by the farsighted and wonderful man who was conducting this select party into the unknown was an object of deep solicitude and interest
out of a desire to tag the various materials understandingly i lifted the lid of my curiosity and let out a few questions
if i mistake not said you mentioned this antitemperature material once before
what is it professor liquid he answered amiably
as a discovery it is outranked only by my antigravity compound
an ounce of the fluid in a bath renders the bather impervious to heat or cold keeping in the animal caloric and keeping out all other extremes of temperature
some of the mixture was incorporated into the paint with which this car is coated
yonder is the water receptacle and the professor nodded toward a large tank opposite him
with economy the supply in that reservoir will last us several months
the food i have provided is of the readyprepared kind mostly in tins with an alcohol lamp for the brewing of tea coffee and chocolate
during this hegira into infinity i have omitted nothing gentlemen which will minister to your comfort
you are a very able man professor acknowledged popham
how long have you been planning this little excursion
ever since i began erecting what the harlemites were pleased to call my castle smiled quinn
the plan was conceived at the time the success of the manipulations of yourself and your friends seemed assured
it was your purpose to foil the speculative gentlemen i struck in and so come to the aid of a longsuffering public
you hit off the matter finely mr munn replied the professor
that was my purpose
could not your antitemperature mixture have been donated to the poor with beneficial results
it is altogether too expensive for general use
i will not conceal from you gentlemen the fact that we are falling sunward
if we make landfall on a planet where the heat is several hundred degrees beyond our earthly powers of endurance the mixture in question will preserve us
falling sunward exclaimed markham
it was hard upon midnight when we left the earth
if my schoolday learning is not at fault the sun at the hour of our departure was on the opposite side of our planet
how then does it happen that we are falling toward the great luminary
bravo cried the professor vastly pleased am glad to see mr markham that your intellect has not suffered a total eclipse by the demands of commercial supremacy
night is the result of one of the hemispheres being turned from the sun and other things being equal we should now be falling toward the outer limits of our solar system but if i may use the term the castle was not aimed for a direct fall from the earths crust
we dropped at a very sharp angle and the influence of the sun has attracted us still farther out of a straight course
i trust you follow me
the three millionaires understood the situation but judging from the expression of their faces the knowledge brought keen disappointment
there are only two planets between the earth and the sun observed markham mercury and venus if i remember rightly
both insignificant grumbled popham
venus is about the size of our own planet gentlemen said the professor
however it has long been supposed that there is another group of planets between mercury and the sun among them a little world called vulcan which that does not interest us cut in meigs
sunward the planets are smaller but they get larger as you go the other way
larger expounded the professor but less dense
as i was about to tell you a moment ago pursued popham meigs markham and i have decided that either saturn or mars would about fill the bill so far as we are concerned
there are lights on mars which as we figure it presupposes electricity and electricity means civilization to a degree that affords us a promising prospect
then again there are canals on mars and if canals certainly water transportation
transportation problems of any sort will interest gilhooly indeed we are prone to think they would bring him back to his normal poise
saturn on the other hand has rings and such a condition might afford opportunities to wideawake men such as are unknown anywhere else in the solar system
take us either to mars or to saturn professor quinn as you may find it most convenient
we demand it
it is impossible to do anything of that kind mr popham returned the professor decidedly
the influence of the sun upon our course is too powerful
are we to understand then cried markham that we are compelled to put up with either mercury or venus
even there gentlemen we have no choice
we are in the grip of circumstances and must perforce accept whatever fate throws our way
possibly we shall become a satellite of the sun revolving around and around planet the smallest of any in the great system
although i felt drowsy i aroused myself with an effort and kept sharp eyes on the professors face
i do not think he was in earnest but merely talking to see what effect his remarks would have on the three millionaires
corner corner corner babbled gilhooly make a corner corner everything
markham dropped his face in his hands meigs bowed his head and i saw a shiver run through popham
egad muttered popham this castle of yours quinn is little short of a steel tomb
inasmuch as we are safely interred whats the use of living
gilhooly is the only fortunate one among us for his reason is shattered and he cannot realize what he is facing
you are talking less like a man now popham reproved quinn than like a driveling idiot
while theres life theres hope
how many brilliant minds have been overthrown as a result of your manipulations of stock in wall street
how many bright futures have been wrecked by an adverse trend of the speculative market
were those unfortunates any better off because thrust into madhouses and unable to realize the fate that had overtaken them
for shame sir
you are perfectly sure are you professor i struck in attempting to give a more pleasant twist to the conversation that we shall come out all right in the end have my plans mr munn he answered not unkindly and the success or failure of them will depend largely upon the mental attitude of these gentlemen
this was too deep for me and i cast about for some equally important question which would bring a less indefinite response
anyhow said we have plenty of food for a long journey
it would be a fearful thing to have a famine soso many miles from a base of supplies
the food supply mr munn answered the professor is adequate
there will be no famine
and the water the oxygen the have looked after everything necessary to our safety and comfort
i had confidence in quinn
he had shown that he was an able man and that his promises were to be taken at face value
with a sigh of relief i settled back in tolerable comfort
meigs took the role of questioner out of my hands at this point and although i was eager to hear all that was said tired natures sweet restorer got the better of my curiosity and i fell asleep on the bale
it is not my purpose to cumber this narrative with the smaller details of our journey novel and thrilling though some of them proved to be
it is with our experiences on the planet which finally claimed us that this account has mostly to do so i shall glide over intermediate incidents in a somewhat cursory manner
our faculties keyed to an understanding of earthly conditions only found themselves continually at bay and at nothing did they stand more aghast than at the lightninglike speed with which we shot through space
the energy developed by the two insulated cubes gave to our steel car the stupendous velocity of one hundred miles per second six thousand miles per minute three hundred and sixty thousand miles per hour
human reason might well falter at the threshold of such immensity
yet while i slept peacefully on that bale in the storeroom these figures were verified by the professor and archibald meigs who happened to be the only two who were wide awake
it has been my lasting regret that they did not rouse me so that i might also have had a view of the noble spectacle for the first time unrolled to earthly eyes
we passed the moon a dreary burnedout world and the professor was able to check off two hundred and forty thousand miles of our sunward plunge
we had traveled a little more than half an hour at our ultimate velocity taking this into consideration and noting the exact minute when we crossed the centre of the satellites orbit the professor was able to do some figuring and so test his theories as to speed
the car skimmed through ether less than five hundred miles above the lunar crust
quinn was doubly pleased for he not only proved that our velocity was substantially as he had supposed but also discovered that the moons attraction so powerful on the tides of our mother sphere could not swerve the car by a hairs breadth from its direct course or overcome the influence of the sun
meigs told me later that the marvelous beauty of the satellite gleaming against the black void with ghostly radiance was probably worth the trip and its attendant inconveniences
he and quinn had looked their fill on the hemisphere which is never seen from the earth
after this the hours literally flew past the novelty of our journey precluding any such thing as monotony
in fact we hardly allowed ourselves a sufficient amount of time for rest and refreshment
a lookout was kept continually at the eyepiece of the telescope to signal the approach of any asteroid with which we might possibly come into collision
only once did this danger threaten us and then as may be supposed it was the professor who proved our salvation
the lever in the wall of the lower or living room of the car communicated with screens ingeniously arranged for shutting off the power of the antigravity cubes
by lessening our speed the professor suffered the asteroid to cross our course our car ducking through the luminous trail that swept out behind it
night reigned around us constantly
our car caught the rays of the sun it is true but the lack of an atmosphere caused the light to be thrown back into space and lost
the castle was nothing less than a small planet attended by five satellites which held to our vicinity by the cars attraction circled around us continually
these satellites were the four knotted handkerchiefs containing the tribute i had levied upon the plutocrats and also the revolver which had assisted me in the work
these objects went through varied phases exactly as more pretentious satellites would have done
it would be difficult to describe my feelings as i watched them from the car windows
i am prone to think at the present writing that this lost booty waxing and waning under my eyes planted in my nature those first seeds of regret which finally grew into a reformation
i recall a conversation that i had with markham while i sat with my eye at the lower end of the telescope watching for stray asteroids
the millionaires had given me to understand that i was not in their set circumstances over which they had no control had brought us together within the narrow confines of the car but no social barriers had been leveled
occasionally the novelty of our situation and the consequent excitement would cause one or other of the wealthy gentleman to forget the gulf that yawned between us
this attitude of the magnate afforded me a good deal of innocent enjoyment
they had left social prestige no less than their bank accounts behind them and what little collateral they had had upon their persons was now satelliting about the car
the line they drew between themselves and me in their thoughtful moments was a distinction without much of a difference
markham i remember was munching a sandwich contrived out of two crackers and a slice of tinned beef
did you never reflect mr munn said he upon the evil of your past
when a man writes books which are mainly drawn from his own experience mr markham said he has to go into his past pretty exhaustively
ah yes i was forgetting about the books
were you not horrified with the results of your retrospection
horrified
well yes here and there
i lost a big haul once through the breaking of a jimmy and i was horrified to think how any dealer in burglars kits could have foisted such an unreliable instrument upon a wellmeaning cracksman
markham stared at me dazedly have set down the experience in chapter one of forty ways for cracking safes i proceeded and one of the first of my ten rules for success in any safecracking job was this be sure that your kit is reliable and without flaws
mr munn mr munn whispered markham hoarsely
think of the people from whom you have taken property dishonestly never think of them but to wish that i had been able to relieve them of more
this is awful muttered markham
you really exult over what you have done
he would have started down the iron stairs had i not restrained him with a word
let me ask you something mr markham said last fall bread went to ten cents a loaf because the wheat market was corneredand a man by the name of markham did the cornering
the people who had to put up that extra five cents missed it more than did those from whom i took five hundred dollars
markham coughed
any asteroids in sight he inquired absently wonder if you ever did any reflecting
i asked tartly
what do you think of quinn and markham looked away as i took my eye from the telescope and gave him an expressive wink donot think i continued that you ever wrote a book called forty ways to starve the poor
you have material enough for a pretty effective volume on the subject but you havenot my nerve
no he returned slowly havenot your nerve
it requires unalloyed impudence and a mind incapable of clear thinking to liken the results of high finance with those of your own petty and highly criminal proceedings
you are too bright a man mr munn to allow yourself to be led afield by sophistries of that kind
mr markham mr markham
i breathed in horrified protest
you have bolstered up your nefarious business with false ideals he went on and you are unregenerate and lost
this is awful
i murmured
when we get to where we are going pursued markham either failing to note my sarcasm or else hoping to ride it down trust you will hold your criminal instincts in check
if there are any people there donot give them any false ideals or implant the notion that your standards belong to the rest of us would not so belittle my ideals i returned bluntly
sir he cried sharply am i to understand that you set yourself up as being any better than mr popham mr gilhooly mr meigs or myself
what you understand doesnot concern me in the least i answered airily
what you donot understand it strikes me is the matter that ought to claim your attention
confound you sir
your overwhelming ignorance is equalled only by your colossal egotism
i am sorry that i allowed myself to be beguiled into any talk with you
our regrets are mutual said for your conversation is demoralizing
you are a past master in successful trickerytrickery of the sort that ought to be stamped out
if the law was as quick to deal with you as with me hold fumed markham plunging for the stairs have heard enough
i have said that i was a hard man in those times
i could call a spade a spade with never a thought that my angle of vision was distorted
i have regretted expressing my views in this frank fashion to markham yet i believe that there was injustice in his remarks no less than in mine
being the only person in the car who possessed a watch the professor appointed me official timekeeper
it was my duty to bulletin the hour with its equivalent in days such as we were accustomed to upon a blackboard in the lower room i had also to enter this information upon a book which the professor called the logbook
every ten hours we had a class in astronomy with the professor as instructor and with every man save gilhooly and the lookout as students
the railway magnates aberration continued all we could do was to watch him solicitously and prevent him from doing any injury to himself or to our paraphernalia
the class learned that the nearest planet with an atmosphere and supposedly habitable was venus which at inferior conjunction is distant some twentyfive million miles from terra as quinn called our own planet
counting out the delays at starting and in maneuvring to escape the asteroid our instructor asserted that we should reach venus in something like seventyfive hours
markham meigs and popham on consulting the bulletin board and finding that seventy hours had passed began to brush their clothes and tidy themselves against the hour of landing
but they were destined to disappointment
unable to locate venus at the point where he had hoped to find it the professor decided that it was nearing superior conjunction and was somewhere on the other side of the sun
meigs made a deplorable display of temper
quinn was a mighty poor astronomer he said sneeringly if he could find himself so far wide of the mark on such a simple matter
meigs further addedwith a good deal of childishness as i thoughtthat the role of a derelict was distasteful to him a derelict he argued was nothing more than a tramp and he objected to being a tramp even a celestial tramp
i was out of patience with the man
admiration for the professor had taken fast hold of me and i would not have him sneered at or maligned
a war of hot words was on between myself and the wall street broker when quinn interfered
true said he we have missed venus by a few millions of miles but we are aimed directly at the orbit of another world and i can so manipulate the lever as to wait for it if necessary and drop upon its surface when it overtakes us
what world is that said popham pricking tip his ears
mercury answered the professor
it is the smallest orb in our solar system and measures some three thousand miles in diameter thought venus was rather contracted for men with such large schemes as ourselves remarked meigs shaking his head but this other planet seems to be smaller still wonder if they have coal mines there murmured popham meditatively
and if they grow wheat and cotton added meigs
if mercury is inhabited spoke up markham eagerly food will certainly be as necessary there as on the earth
i donot know gentlemen but it strikes me we might fall into worse places
poor gilhooly sighed meigs
what a pity it will be if the mercurials prove to have traction interests
how long before we shall reach this planet you speak of professor inquired popham
well answered quinn thoughtfully mercury is rather slow
it travels along its orbit at the rate of thirty miles per second while we are moving at one hundred miles
at a rough estimate i should say we can effect a juncture with the planet in ten hours although an extra hour may be required for maneuvres to secure a landing
the ten hours that followed were hours of great anxiety and feverish labor
believing that my nerves were the steadiest the professor placed me at the telescope to act as pilot while he served as engineer and manipulated the lever
the responsibilities of my position so worked upon me that i had no time for the glories of the planet we were endeavoring to intercept
through the telescope i saw huge mountains and broad plains but they were blurred over with a reddish light and the lesser details of topography were lost
when five hours were gone the professor left the lever and came upstairs to have a look through the telescope for himself
you have done very well indeed mr munn he was pleased to say but i think that i had better take this post from now on while you go below and station yourself at the switch board
the slightest mismanagement when the critical moment arrives might hurl us against mercury with a force that would result in annihilation
the lever turns in a half circle as you may know
the arc is divided into spaces numbered from zero to ninety
i will call down to you the number to which you must throw the lever you will repeat the number back to me and instantly obey my order
trust me sir said but the professor was loath to let me go without still further impressing upon me the importance of the work before us
in order to alight safely mr munn he continued we must graduate the power of the antigravity cubes to the mercurial atmosphere
by proceeding intelligently in the matter we shall make the car weigh slightly more than the atmosphere we encounter then when we are about to land we will let the car just counterbalance the pull of the planet and there will not be the slightest jar understand professor i answered and went downstairs
markham meigs and popham ascended to the upper chamber this position bringing them a few feet nearer the goal of our desires as well as giving them a point of vantage from which to watch events
gilhooly was the only one besides myself in the lower room he was kneeling on the divan writing imaginary stock quotations on the steel wall with the point of his finger
for four hours or more the professor called out for slight variations in the speed of the car but in the main the lever was held on the number which gave a maximum velocity
the tension of the minutes ushering in the last hour of the ten is beyond my power to describe
once in my evil days i manipulated the tumblers of a combination and pulled open a vault door
behind the door stood two men with revolvers
for two seconds i stared agape at the trap which i had sprung upon myself and when i got away i had a bullet in my shoulder
intensify my feelings fourfold as i stood looking into the leveled revolvers of those two men then spread out the two seconds to cover a half hour
in this way only can i describe my state of mind while we fought for a safe landing on the planet mercury
cries of wonder and apprehension echoed to me from overhead
above them i heard the shrill voice of the professor zero
zero i repeated throwing the lever clear over
there followed a jolt as the screens covered the cubes and shut off their energy
instantly there came the sickening sensation of a fall accompanied by a rush of displaced air that roared and bellowed all about the car shrieked quinn
i yelled throwing the lever half over
then we caught ourselves with a suddenness that threw me to my knees
we were moving upward could feel the steel floor rising under me
twenty came down from above
twenty i answered hoarsely struggling erect and shifting the lever
i felt that we were still rising but slowly
the professor was juggling with an unknown atmosphere and on the success of his judgment depended our lives
fifteen
fifteen and over went the lever for five degrees
we were swinging stationary in midair
from the window by the switch board i looked outward and downward with bulging eyes
a dazzling glow covered peak and plain and i turned away that my sight might not be blinded to the lever numbers
ten cried the professor
ten it is and i threw the switch to the number given
then again we dropped but slowly very slowly
five
i repeated the order and again the air rushed against the blunt base of the car yet not so fiercely as before
then all of a sudden i felt a grip of fingers about my throat and i was hauled from the lever and thrown back on the floor
gilhooly had a knee on my breast and was strangling me with fingers of steel
the fire of an insane purpose gleamed in his eyes and he seemed possessed of the strength of a dozen demons
i struggled but i might as well have tried to rise under the thousandtons pressure of a hydraulic press
ten cried quinn
i did not could not for my tongue was lolling between my lips
ten screamed quinn were lost a groan hardly audible escaped my gasping throat
i heard a frantic clamor above and then there was such a jar and crash as i hope i shall never experience again
all tangible life slipped away from me and i collapsed into an unconsciousness that i felt might be death itself
a that our lives were preserved and the car saved from destruction was due to two circumstances one of them most peculiar and of farreaching importance
the lesser of the two circumstances was this the car had not dropped to the plain but had had its downward rush intercepted by an elevation so that the force of our fall was just about half what might have been expected
as to the other and more vital circumstance the fall itself was not what it would have been on our own sphere
the pull of gravity on mercury as we afterward discovered has only onethird the power it has on terra
to this phenomenon were due many wonderful things as the reader will discover before we have gone very far
i was not the first of our party to open his eyes after the landing for when i sat up and stared about me i saw the professor moving around the steel chamber and ministering to the others
gilhooly was creeping toward the divan on all fours muttering something about a great slump in the market and chuckling over the way in which he had got out from under
archibald meigs was groaning and trying to lift himself on his elbow augustus popham was on his knees wobbling erratically and apparently undecided whether to say his prayers or to try and get up hannibal markham was flattened out along the floor the professor kneeling over him and chafing his temples
what sort of a navigator are you quinn asked meigs crossly
by gad it is more dangerous to make port with you than it is to sail through space blame the professor for a fault of mine meigs i spoke up warmly
the broker looked at me with something like contempt blame him for placing an incompetent and irresponsible person at such an important post as the switch board said meigs
he should have known that a man who holds your distorted views on the subject of personal property is not to be trusted right added popham lifting himself to the divan
gilhooly made an attack on me said he bore me down and came within one of strangling me
quinn is the cause of abnormal condition persisted meigs who was bound to have quinn at fault for every evil that overtook us
i got up rather more wrathful than the situation demanded
the fall had jarred my temper no less than my body and i was in a mood to have the business out with meigs at close quarters
softly mr munn cautioned the professor
it is well to have a deaf ear for these gentlemen at times
help me lift mr markham to the divan
the professors words dispelled my anger
without another word to meigs i went over and assisted in getting the food trust magnate into a more comfortable position
markham was not long in recovering and when we took stock of ourselves we found that we were not much the worse for our shaking up
quinn called to me to go upstairs with him and see if any havoc had been wrought there
we found that no particular damage had been done to the instruments or other material
when we descended to the lower chamber after an absence of fifteen or twenty minutes meigs had the key in the steel door and was standing at the entrance with popham and markham on either side of him
where did you get that key demanded the professor one hand groping in his pocket
heretofore he had been careful to keep the key upon his person
small wonder that he was now surprised to find it in the possession of meigs found it on the floor replied the broker with a good deal of dignity
probably you lost it out of your pocket when you fell from the stairs a few minutes ago what are you intending to do asked the professor quietly
professor quinn sir returned meigs with elaborate condescension we have reached the parting of the ways
while we were traveling through space i and my friends could do nothing less than bear with your company and with that of the rogue at your side but now that we are safely moored on mercury and can debark we see fit to withdraw ourselves and renounce further intercourse with you
ah murmured quinn a slow smile hovering about his thin lips
the smile caused some acerbity to manifest itself in the three gentlemen at the door
they drew themselves up haughtily
quinn went on the broker sharply you lured us into your castle and abducted us from our native orb with small regard for the feelings of our relatives or friends and no consideration whatever for the business interests with which we were engaged so your business interests had my every consideration interrupted the professor
meigs took no notice of the remark
so he continued remembering these wrongs we feel that we can no longer associate with you
as for he turned a fastidious eye in my is utterly impossible to men of our social standing
this planet you tell us is three thousand miles in diameter
may we request that you and munn take one end of the diameter and leave the other end to us
the professor laughed softly and seated himself
sit down mr munn said he
we have been ostracized by our fellowexiles
let us see how well they get along without us
we bid you farewell finished meigs loftily
thereupon he turned the key threw open the doorand dropped on the threshold as though he had been shot
markham and popham cried aloud threw their arms across their faces and reeled back
a blast as from a furnace drove in at the opening filling the chamber like a draft from hades
i could scarcely breathe in the stifling atmosphere
hurry munn cried quinn
drag meigs away from the door or hell be burned to a crisp
the broker was already smoking when i caught his ankles and jerked him inside
the professor slammed the door
presently the air within the car readjusted itself to normal conditions
meigs red as a beet and breathing heavily was little the worse for his warm experience fancy mr meigs cooed the professor that you will wish to avail yourself of one of my antitemperature baths before cutting loose from myself and mr munn
there is plenty of water left for all of us and i will go aloft set up the collapsible tub and make the bath ready
we have alighted in the tropics evidently and at the period of midsummer
the temperature is about five hundred degrees fahrenheit
with that the professor took the key from the door to keep gilhooly from making a dash outside and started for the storeroom
i followed him the three disgruntled gentlemen gazing after us mutely
the professor and i were the first to fortify ourselves with the antitemperature bath
after dipping our bodies we rinsed our clothing in the liquid
aside from a pleasant cooling sensation the bath gave no evidence of its potent qualities
there was no hardening of the skin as i fancied there might be no change in its ruddy color no inconvenience
when we went down again we sent the other three gentlemen aloft the professor instructing them as to the necessity of making their clothing as well as their bodies proof against the climate
in due course popham meigs and markham once more showed themselves
gilhooly of course had also to be made immune and he struggled against it so fiercely that we were obliged to hold him in the tub while the professor poured three buckets of the mixture over him
he was not disrobed and when sufficiently drenched he leaped from the tub and fled raving to the lower chamber
now said the professor we are prepared to fare forth
you addressed himself to markham meigs and go with mr munn and me or keep by yourselves as you may elect
but it will be well to make this car our headquarters
here we have food and drink also a stronghold in case of attack by the there happen to be any
how can there be any life in such an overheated atmosphere inquired markham
nature is a great leveler of barriers replied quinn
she is able to adjust life to its environment you may be sure just as easily as she can bridge the social chasm that separates a thief from a trust magnate
his eyes twinkled
such a bridge he added would not prove much of a tax on her resources
for my own part i do not think the chasm either so wide or so deep as you gentlemen appear to imagine
i chuckled at that and meigs and his two companions grew duly resentful
as for mr gilhooly continued quinn we cannot take him with us on our tour of observation
it will be best to leave him locked in the car
i will close the trap leading into the storeroom and i do not think it will be possible for him to work much damage in the room below donot know what good it will do me to go out with your exploring expedition said popham dejectedly in a country as hot as this there can be no earthly use for coal
or wearing apparel added meigs listlessly
cotton couldnot grow in such a temperature
and as for wheat
he shook his head wearily
cotton and wheat were the abc of his wall street experience
beyond those commodities he groped in the dark
what sort of food can be grown on such a sunbaked planet grumbled markham
the railway man was shouting something about watered stock and his babbling was wafted up to us
gilhooly added markham is the only fortunate man in the party
realization will blast the hopes and mayhap prove the death of the rest of us while hehe cannot realize
you gentlemen lose courage too quickly said the professor
in my lectures on venus i told you how that planet was inclined to the plane of its orbit
the axis of mercury has a still greater inclination in fact the orb leans on itself as though about to fall
its days are of about the same length as the days of three minutes longerbut its years owing to its contracted orbit are much shorter
in eightyeight days mercury makes its round so that each season is only twentytwo days in length
at the poles of mercury in what answers to the polar regions of our own earth there must be a more tempered climate then let us get there by all means cut in popham
in whatever we do answered quinn we must make haste slowly get out and look around anyhow cried meigs
it may happen after all that we have a world to conquer here and i have not the patience to remain longer in this steel cell of yours
very good returned the professor
we will make our preparations and go forth
he shut off the flow of oxygen from the tank and then followed the rest of us to the under apartment closing a steel door over the trap at the head of the stairs and locking it
gilhooly imagining himself a conductor was walking around the edge of the circular divan collecting tickets from imaginary passengers
sing sing he called out as the professor unlocked the door at the entrance and pulled it open where you get off munn said meigs maliciously where we all get off returned the professor smiling
thereupon we passed hastily into the blinding glare of the mercurial day
for several minutes our eyes rebelled at the brightness when finally they became inured to it we looked around us upon a desolation that struck dismay to our hearts
we saw then that our car had alighted upon an elevation which was nothing less than the rim of an extinct volcano of vast proportions
from ridge to ridge across the abysmal crater at least half a mile could be measured
it was beyond the power of our eyes to penetrate to the black depths of the great pit
listen cried the professor his voice resounding so thunderously as almost to deafen ussome trick of the atmosphere
we stood silently our ears alert and heard a confused babel of sound proceeding apparently out of the very core of the volcano fires may be at work down there whispered the professor nodding toward the crater
even the whisper sounded unpleasantly loud to us
what a world came from augustus popham in bellowing tones
with fire within and without what chance is there for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
some of meigs peevishness had got into the coal man and he rent the air with it
we remained mule after this outburst i with my gaze hopefully on the professor and the professor blinking at the sun
in a little time i allowed my own eyes to falter zenithward and the glory of the sun in midheaven has ever since been one of the treasured memories of my life
its disk was six times its diameter as viewed from earth and the grandeur of its flaming surface is beyond the powers of my feeble pen to make known
i was oppressed and held captive by a feeling of awe and wonder
there was a red tinge to the atmosphere caused by a reflection from the red of the planets bricklike crust through this warm color pulsed the golden streamersyellow and scarlet overhead fading to faintest orange on the horizon
think you mr popham murmured the professor his voice awakening us as from a trance that all yon splendor which has been in these skies for ages upon ages was created for the enjoyment of no living thing
if so you are wrong
there are now as there have always been beings with an intelligence capable of appreciating all this magnificent profusion of light and color
but enough
we have looked down into the crater and up into the heavens suppose we turn our eyes another way and see what there is to offer
he faced about as he spoke and gazed down the bare rocky slope of the volcano and off across an equally bare and forbidding plain
no trees no water no life of any kind muttered meigs querulously
there is a bright spot over there said quinn shading his eyes and pointing
our eyes followed his finger and encountered a glittering object on a slight elevation
as we gazed the object whatever it was slowly vanished
we might investigate that suggested popham excitedly
perhaps it was a mercurial wearing a sort of armor to protect him from the heat
it may be that there are people here and that they live underground
he would have started forthwith but the professor stretched out a hand and detained him
just a moment said quinn
before we get too far from the car let me make sure that all of you are sufficiently immune from the heat
do you feel that you are fully protected in that respect gentlemen
so far as i was personally concerned i had not felt the slightest inconvenience from the suns rays
i declared as much and the others likewise so expressed themselves another one of the things spoke up meigs pointing in another direction
we were just able to detect a glow on another low elevation when it also flashed into thin air
then we began looking for the little hills and counted no less than a dozen within our range of vision
some of the hills were capped with the mysterious gleam which dazzled for a time and then twinkled out
the professor was perplexed as i could see plainly examine one of those hills said meigs and find out what this means
the top of the volcano where we were standing was perhaps five hundred feet from the plain
as meigs spoke he leaped for a rock a yard or so below him
to the astonishment of all of us he rose in the air like a human balloon soared over the rock by a score of feet and alighted several rods down the slope
it was a titanic jump but meigs had regained a foothold with the lightness of a piece of down
he was a large man was meigs his ponderosity exceeding two hundred pounds fairbanks
he was as much surprised at his agility as we were and began to essay various feats
he leaped straight upward gaining a maximum height of a dozen yards and returning lightly and easily to his original position
next he coupled his leap with an aerial somersault and carried on with an abandon much beneath the dignity of a wall street broker as it struck me
in fact he acted like a schoolboy out for a holiday and so full of animal spirits he hardly knew what to do with himself think he belonged to a circus observed the disgusted popham go down there and put a stop to the performance
and go along and help added markham visibly distracted because of the brokers folly
they started down the steep with rodlong steps and presently one would have thought they wore sevenleague boots from the amount of speed they developed
instead of putting a stop to the brokers performance they joined in
by and by they were playing leapfrog every bound taking them forward half a hundred feet
gravity here is far from having the force it has on terra remarked the professor
exertion comes easy and gives most astonishing results
those men mr munn are not used to such activity yet their marvelous gymnastics do not seem to tire them in the least
suppose that we ourselves make a test of the mercurial gravity
i needed no second bidding and quinn and i took the descent as buoyantly as thistledown before the wind
somehow the lightness of our heels got into our heads and the staid professor and myself began cavorting like a pair of tenyearolds
the delightful freedom of movement was as novel as it was exhilarating
liberty of muscle bred license of mind had we been smoking opium we could not have acted more outrageously
nor was there any fatigue apparent
i felt that i could have run a hundred miles in as many minutes and never paused for breath
carried away by the wonderful effects of diminished gravity we forgot all about our projected investigation of the little hills
in the midst of a game of tag we were suddenly brought to our senses with a round turn
a pall had fallen over the landscape
the sun was blotted out by inky clouds and a tremendous wind began to blow
we must get back to the car cried quinn
his voice great in volume though it was was all but drowned in the shriek and roar of the blast
the lightness that had afforded us so much enjoyment in still air now became a source of grave danger for we could not keep our feet in the fury of the tempest
merciful powers roared popham as he and meigs were driven against each other with a terrific impact
although sorely put to it to keep myself from being blown away i managed to cling to a rock and watch the weird gyrations of the two millionaires
their collision had caused them to lose their footing and clinging desperately to each other they were hurled back and forth touching the ground now and then only to rebound from it like rubber balls
and all the time this tumbling was going on both men were whooping frantically for some one to come to their aid
i was too hard beset to think of leaving my place of temporary refuge and it was only when i saw the professor and markham their right hands clasped staggering toward the two men that i made up my mind to join them
three of us in a chain might be able to do something toward rescuing popham and meigs
breathing deep like a swimmer about to plunge through a whirlpool i cast myself adrift and allowed the wind to drive me in the direction of the professor and markham
no matter how strongly i braced backward against the blast every time i lifted a foot i was hurled onward and almost overturned
finally more by good luck than anything else i came close enough to catch the professors hand
popham and meigs will be killed if we canot get to them shouted markham
there were eddies in the wind like those in the swift current of a stream and popham and meigs had become entangled in them
had they been blown off on a straightaway course they would long since have been too far away for us to do anything toward laying hands on them and getting them upright
the professor had taken note of the gyratory movements of our hapless companions and he called upon markham and me to plant ourselves as firmly as possible and remain in our present positions
this was easier said than done yet by calling upon every ounce of our reserve strength we contrived after a fashion to keep our places
popham and meigs were bounding and leaping through the arc of a great circle
all we had to do was to remain where we were and wait for them
they came to us in midair and we had literally to reach up and pull them down
for a space the five of us were tangled in an indiscriminate heap our united weight offering greater resistance to the wind and giving us an opportunity to rest and collect our scattered wits
join hands cried the professor and well get under the lee of that rock
careful now
we must not get separated again
by desperate work we succeeded in getting to our feet and clasping hands then hurled and buffeted we gained the rock and fell breathless under the leeward side of it
what a place what a place groaned popham wish venus hadnot been out of our course wailed meigs
certainly we couldnot have been any worse off there than here
no wonder nothing can grow on this sunscorched world growled markham
even if plants could stand the heat such a wind would pull them up by the roots
what are we to do now demanded popham
you got us into this quinn and youve got to get us out of it a good time for you three to go off to the other side of the planet i remarked
whenever theres danger you suddenly realize that you canot get along without the professor
oh youre a fine lot of nabobs you are
peace mr munn called the professor
we have enough to occupy our minds without wasting time in useless bickering
i was at fault for i knew what terrible gales visit this planet and that they come suddenly
it was a mistake to venture so far from the car mistake breathed meigs with some heat that came near having tragic consequences
popham and i were knocked about like a couple of footballs to be done whats to be done cried popham impatiently
the gale is increasing and who knows but this rock may be plucked up bodily and rolled over us
we canot stay here
that is true said the professor
we must get back to the car no telling what will become of us if we try that called markham
and theres no telling what will become of us if we remain here answered the professor
if we form a chain it is quite possible that we may succeed in getting back to our refuge
even the car may not be able to stand up against this wind clamored meigs
we shall have to take our chances with it nevertheless went on quinn
if we should get separated each of us must make the best preparations he can to weather the gale and then when it has blown itself out hunt for the car
that must be our rendezvous during the time we are here
the professor got up slowly bracing himself against the fierce swirl that came around the side of the rock
come he called it is now or never
i could see that the gale had increased alarmingly
its force seemed irresistible and yet i knew that we could not remain where we were
we clasped hands again but were unable to cling together being lifted high and thrown helterskelter in all directions
lightning flashedsuch lightning as i have never seen before or since
it snapped and crackled overhead and ran like trailing serpents over the rocks
we were in a sea of flame
and the thunder
it seemed to split the heavens and crack open the lavalike hills
rain came yet not rain for it turned to damp vapor in the redhot atmosphere
the mercurial elements were at warwind steam thunder and lightning all marshaling their hosts and charging to conflict
to regain the steel car was impossible
we were lost in the fearsome fury of darkness and storm driven helplessly and with smashing force across the vast plain
i was hurled against something which i gripped with convulsive energy
the something gripped me in return
help
i cried bereft of my wits and eager only for rescue
munn shouted a voice
is this you
quinn
i exclaimed
we must hang together said quinn
and then tightly locked in each others arms we were lifted high on a billow of fog and driven relentlessly i know not how far
when the blast released us we fell to the rocks and rolled over and over then the surface beneath us gave way and we dropped
the distance we fell could be only a matter of guesswork and even guesswork was out of the question in the disordered state of our minds at that moment
suffice to say the fall did not render us unconscious and we struck on something that vibrated under the impact of our bodies
we were still in blank darkness and the turmoil of the tempest no longer beat about us but could be heard crashing somewhere overhead
thank heaven murmured the professor withdrawing himself from me
are you alive mr munn believe so i answered
what has happened to us professor
we have been flung into some sort of a shelter it seems to me he replied
but we are not on stable ground he added
we are sitting on an object that is descending with us descending rapidly andah wonder of wonders
abruptly we fell into broad day surrounded by such sights and sounds that i thought myself dealing with the mysteries of a disordered dream
professor quinn and i were sitting on a large box constructed of metal that was polished to dazzling brilliancy
so far as our purposes were concerned this box was nothing less than an elevator we had fallen upon it and it had carried us down into the wonderful interior of the planet
now truly we were in another worlda world that teemed with lifea smiling and pleasant region underlying a most barren and inhospitable shell
the scoriated exterior of the planet was the husk here was the kernel
it was a white world extending league on league in every direction and roofed with a lofty vault that sparkled as with stars
from every hand came a beelike hum proving that we were in a hive of industry and life
houses spread out before us in rows queerly shaped structures that looked as though they might have been built of alabaster and so diminutive that the tallest scarcely came more than head high
back of the houses were fields thickly covered with nodding blossoms that looked like snow through the fields ran waterways dividing each into small squares
so intent were we on the background of this strange picture that we failed to take account of what was going on in our immediate vicinity
suddenly a weird creature hopped to the top of the box and stood between my companion and myself regarding us fixedly
this i supposed was one of the mercurials
if he considered the professor and myself objects of curiosity and surmise we were no less keen in so regarding him
he stood twentythree or twentyfour inches high his head was an ivory billiard ball and his trunk a larger spheroid from his middle downward hung a red kirtle
he had one eye at the front of the head and an ear at the back the olfactory organ was missing but there was a mouth opening perpendicularly under the eye
the upper spheroid rested directly on the lower and at each side of the lower one corresponding to the shoulders were two tentaclelike arms sinuous as whips and ending in hands that were made up of a palm and seven digits
queerest of all there were two more arms set in the breast and back
from the creatures shoulder was suspended a round object like a canteen
for all of five minutes quinn and i eyed this surprising figure and were eyed in return
can you talk english asked the professor at last
it was a foolish question such as i was far from expecting from the professor but something had to be said and i suppose that was as good as anything else
as the professor began speaking the head whirled squarely around presenting the ear
after my companion was done the head spun back again and the breast arm caught the canteen while the fingers of a shoulder arm began manipulating a set of keys
the result was language with all the variations of tone and accent
but it was an unknown tongue if an expression of that kind may be allowed in such a case
since the wordbox was as ineffective as our own speech we fell back with more success on the language of signs
at this the mercurial had the better of us for he could make signs with four hands
the professor signified that we were hungry and the mercurial signified that we were to descend from the box
this we did and found ourselves in the centre of a group of mercurials whose wordboxes were chattering like so many magpies
the mercurial with whom we were already on gesticulating terms played off some orders on his own canteen and two of the others advanced upon the box from which we had just descended
pulling out a slide in the side of the receptacle they exposed two ewers of steaming food and we were motioned to fall to
we stood not upon the order but obeyed instantly using a pair of small paddles which were thrust into our hands
i had no idea what the food might be but it was tender and of good flavor bright little people observed the professor as he ate
seemingly i responded
nature has denied them the power of speech yet see how they have surmounted the difficulty
i must give that talking machine of theirs a close inspection
we are in a most wonderful country mr munn
the little i have seen of it already quite dazes me said what a pickpocket a man could make of himself with all those hands
quinn gave me a reproachful look and i hastily apologized for even mentioning a branch of my profession
do you understand now said he turning the subject very pleasantly what those bright objects were which we saw on the tops of the low hills
no said they were ovens he answered
food is put in them and sent up to the hot surface of the planet
when properly cooked it is lowered again
association with this learned man was a liberal education in itself
i can never be sufficiently thankful to fate for causing our paths to cross
you think then said that we were blown to the top of one of the hills and fell into a shaft used by the traveling ovens
nothing else could have happened
the professor gave a start and looked worried
dear dear he exclaimed was quite forgetting our friends
while we are here feasting and taking our ease they are battling with the storm and are no doubt in peril of their lives
how very very thoughtless we are mr munn
i was not greatly exercised over the matter
the trust magnates believed that there was a figurative gulf between myself and them and i was more than willing that this gulf should grow from the symbol to the reality doubt if we can return to the outside of the planet at present professor said and even if we were able to do so what could we accomplish in the face of that tremendous storm
true very true said he
that oven said by way of taking his mind from the plutocrats must have been very warm when we landed on it and descended to these regions
we should have been grilled sir returned the professor but for the fact that we are coated and our clothing impregnated with my antitemperature fluid
these mercurials appear to stand the heat pretty well i remarked
covered as we are with the antitemperature compound he returned it is impossible for us to judge even approximately of the degree of heat that obtains in these regions
naturally it must be very much less than prevails on the surface of the planet and yet even at that if left unprotected we should probably be shriveled to cinders
hardly professor i ventured to protest
those i waved my paddle toward the open growing rank with a white herb which is evidently cooked in these ovens and served for food
quite likely we are eating of it now and very good eating i find it
however the point i wish to make is this if the heat was so intense as you surmise those fields would be wilted and dried up
nature mr munn answered the professor adapts itself to every condition
on our own planet we see how life and comfort are rendered possible in every zone from the farthest north to the tropics and this same adaptability of intelligent creatures to their environment we may be sure proceeds throughout the universe
these oneeared oneeyed diminutive creatures are formed in the manner best calculated to afford them comfort and happiness amid these surroundings
and as with them so with the products of their husbandry
you could argue a squirrel out of a tree professor said with wholesouled admiration am sorry i did not take a course of scientific training for it would have helped me immensely in my business
a burglar should be an allaround man
if i ever return to terra so long as you feel as you do regarding your odious profession mr munn broke in the professor compressing his lips you will never return to terra return is possible
i asked hiding the wonder his words aroused
anything is possible
how about the millionaires
are they to return provided the means are at hand
provided they experience a change of heart
in their present state of delusion they are mere firebrands of destruction
before they ever again take part in mundane affairs they must be taught to see things differently
i wonder what has become of them
the professors brow clouded with anxiety fret about them professor said they are not overeager for our society
let them have a taste of shifting for themselves without your knowledge and resourcefulness to shield them from everything that goes wrong
it will do them a world of good
perhaps you are right mr munn my companion answered musingly
if i could know they had survived the storm i should feel tolerably easy in my mind
these little mercurials appear to be a friendly people and if our comrades escaped that frightful tempest they must sooner or later fall into the hands of these dwellers of the underworld suppose i ventured seeking to draw my companions mind from the plutocrats that this mercurial underworld is another illustration of the way nature takes care of her protgs
after baking the outside shell of the planet to a degree that makes all life impossible she thoughtfully scoops out the interior so that these small creatures will have a place to go
you have stated the case correctly mr munn and the professors face lighted up as he swept his gaze over the country immediately adjacent
these ovens he proceeded are a remarkable example of adapting means to an end
the fierce heat of the surface does the cooking
popham will find little pleasure in that i laughed
like the rest of us answered the professor grimly he will have to accustom himself to new conditions
everything must be different here from the surroundings with which we have been familiar all our lives
i wonder what form of property is considered most valuable to these mercurials
the professor frowned
my mind was running in its old groove despite its novel environment
that query was inspired by an unworthy motive mr munn said quinn severely
i bowed humbly
every man his own way said cannot help trying to adjust myself along the line of the principles i know best
nevertheless i am of an intensely curious disposition and those talkboxes fill me with wonder
the mercurials are dumb it seems answered the professor and they have to resort to purely mechanical means for an exchange of ideas
language appears to flow readily enough from the little boxes
if any one of them ever lost his four hands i observed he would not only find it impossible to help himself but would be unable to tell others what to do to help him
nature has been prodigal with them in the matter of hands and in this no doubt showed her usual wisdom am glad to see your thoughts taking a philosophical trend mr munn said the professor
it argues well for your future
by that time we had emptied the receptacle of food and as we dropped our paddles and drew back the wordboxes of a hundred mercurials shrieked despairingly
the pygmies clustered about the empty basins glared into them and then turned their menacing eyes on the professor and myself
goodness me mr munn exclaimed the professor
we have probably eaten the food supply of the entire district
if we do not have a care our voracious appetites are like to prove our undoing
look there come more of the mercurials after their supper warrant and they are going to be disappointed
i looked in the direction indicated by the professor and saw a long line of billiard balls rolling our way
it was a procession headed by a pompous little mercurial whose trunk and arms were gorgeously gilded
with two of his hands he carried a metal plate and spoon and with the other two he wielded a silver baton about the size of a match
plates and paddles were also carried by the rest of the advancing mercurials their wordboxes chanting a sort of quickstep
the sight of the professor and myself towering mountainlike over the throng about us brought the procession to an abrupt halt with a squeak of dismay
the gentleman in the red kirtle went forward and held converse with the gentleman of the gilt torso
before they got through their wordboxes were fairly roaring and stricken groans went up from every talkmachine in the line
the advent of two leviathans like my companion and myself must have had a demoralizing effect but that seemed as nothing in comparison with the harrowing results of our voracity
the leader raised his baton
silence fell
the leader then advanced to where we were standing and circled around us examining us critically with his solitary eye
the survey finished he tried his wordbox on us the professor answering in all the languages of our home planet living and dead of which he was master
but in vain we could not come to an understanding
the begilded gentleman finally gave over and whirled on the underling in the red kirtle
his fingers flew over the keys of his canteen and speech of a swift and commanding kind was poured out
a skurrying about of the oven tenders resulted
from somewhere a fresh supply of uncooked food was brought and placed in the huge metal box
while this was going forward quinn suddenly seized my arm a troubled look crossing his face
what is the matter professor
i asked
matter enough mr munn he answered
the lever was left on number five
his thoughts were up with the steel car
i was surprised at this for it appeared to me that there was more than enough to claim our full attention right in our immediate vicinity
and what of that sir
i asked
the antigravity cubes lighten the car by five degrees he answered excitedly
thus buoyed and in its elevated position i doubt if the car should hold its own against the fury of the storm
you think it has been blown aye
blown to the uttermost parts of mercury and perhaps wrecked and lostlost with all our scientific apparatus and other paraphernalia
but and that is not all went on the professor
the lever should have been thrown to zero and then removed to prevent gilhooly from tampering with it
who knows what that mad railway magnate may take it into his head to do
suppose he were to grasp the lever and give the cubes their full power
he would be launched into the void sir and we should be marooned on this sunbaked planet compelled to live out our lives with these oneeyed quadrumana devastating the country of its food supplyour presence a curse instead of a blessing
i had already imagined a possible return to terra and from this it seemed that the professor had not lost sight of that contingency
what is to be done
i asked catching some of his excitement
we must return to the outer shellwe must find the carwe must go back on the oven when they send it up
as he finished speaking quinn ran frantically to the metal box and leaped to its top
i followed clumsily upsetting a half dozen mercurials who chanced to gel in my way
the oven was loaded by that time and ready for its return to the intense heat nay more the chef in the red kirtle already had his hand on a wheel which presumably released the lifting power
our movements however had acted as a check on proceedings got to go back cried the professor forgetting in his stress of feeling that his words were lost on the throng around us attempt to stop us donot return the mercurials began leaping to the box from all sides in a veritable swarm
carried away by the excitement of the moment i sank to my knees and swept my arms about me throwing them back pellmell
the professor also resorted to violence
in the midst of it all i caught a glimpse of the gilded gentleman aiming his baton
a moment more and there was a lurid flash which enveloped my companion and myself in a billow of violet fire
every atom of strength was drawn from my limbs and i fell limply to the ground with the professor on top of me
it was not the violet fire that did the work for the professor and me
rather it was some chemical known to the mercurials and which manifested its presence by an overpowering odor
long after we had regained consciousness the druglike smell clung to our clothes and sapped our strength
shackles of iron could not have been more effective in making us prisoners
cords were made fast to our feet and we were dragged by a small army of mercurials down the principal street of their city and out into one of the white irrigated fields
had a dwelling been found large enough i presume we should have been comfortably housed but we were of such stupendous proportions that there were no walls capable of containing us
when we reached the field a ring a foot high was reared about us
as the odor lessened and my strength increased i tried to roll over this low barrier but received such a shock that i was only too glad to roll back to the professors side again
it is of no use mr munn said the professor who had been watching my attempt
these mercurials are possessed of ways and means beyond our earthly powers to combat
we must accept the situation with all the philosophy we can muster
this great man who could remain unshaken under any fate that befell him was a constant source of strength and inspiration to me
while we lay forsaken by our captors and couched on the strange white herbage of that underground field our discourse drifted along many channels
i remember that i asked him a question concerning a matter that had long been weighing upon my mind
how is it professor said that your antigravity compound remains in a liquid state in an open cask
i should think its inherent energy would cause it to fly upward en masse can demonstrate that by means of an algebraic formula said he
are you acquainted with algebra
no i answered humbly
then he went on disappointedly fear you will have to remain in ignorance
you must rest content with the evidence of your senses since an explanation in terms you can understand is impossible
and thus the matter rested
when we were so far recovered as to be able to rise we made an attempt to step over the ring that hemmed us in but were shocked by the same unseen power i had already encountered and driven back
see with what weapons nature has provided these people murmured the professor
throughout the universe everywhere you will find mr munn that nature takes care of her own
ah here comes captain goldman
retainers follow and they are bringingnow what are they bringing
why as i live they have manufactured a couple of large wordboxes
evidently we are to be taught the use of them
the professor was right
ever since our disastrous attempt to regain the surface we had been tabooed by the inhabitants of the country
captain goldman as my companion referred to the little man who had used his mysterious baton with such telling effect was crossing the fields toward us followed by six of his countrymen bearing the talking machines
as a precautionary measure the captain carried his weapon
arriving at the ring captain goldman reversed the baton and with the black tip of it cut an imaginary doorway for himself in the air
he then stepped through and joined us without shock or resistance
thus by means to us inexplicable he broke the power of the circle at a given point
the others followed him through the entrance he had cleared
wielding the baton with two of his hands captain goldman began manipulating his wordbox with the other two
he was not addressing us however but those who had come with him
three of his followers advanced to me with one of the machines while the remaining three conveyed a machine to the professor
at once our instruction in the art of mechanical speech began
it is not my intention to burden the readers with the details of our lessons although a few remarks under this head may not be out of place
as to the wordbox itself it had seven keys
this made it somewhat difficult for a fivefingered creature to operate with any great degree of fluency although the professor did get so he could peg out his ideas at a remarkable rate
there are but six syllables in the mercurial language each syllable being represented by a corresponding key
the way these syllables were fingered gave the words
as they could be combined and repeated and combined again the vocabulary of the boxes was practically unlimited
the syllable notes were of resonant quality and of such divergent timber as to be quickly and easily recognized
the syllable for key was synonymous with our personal pronoun and was the most assertive and determined note in the whole gamut of the box
the seventh key emitted a sound so utterly unlike the other sounds as to be in a class by itself
it was used for spacing between words for exclamatory purposes and for the audible expression of laughter and grief
it was likewise the expletive or swearkey for these small egotists had all the passions of other mortals and key acted as a sort of safety valve
the manner in which the key was used gave it its versatility
day by day our lessons proceeded the professor learning with a rapidity that was marvelous
he was well along in the polysyllables while i was struggling with the basic tones and acquiring some facility in spacing and in the expression of the feelings
our ears kept pace with our fingers and in a fortnight the professor was so eloquent with his wordbox that he could now and then play off a metaphor or some other frill to the great delight of himself and his auditors
next to a wonderful jimmy invented by a cracksman named cricket doniphan whom i knew well and who at that period was doing time in stillwater i take off my hat to that mercurial wordbox as the most marvelous contrivance ever evolved by a thinking mind
i have a very good memory and when sufficiently proficient with the keys i practiced by repeating passages from forty ways of cracking safes which as distinguished from the manual i considered my chef doeuvre
i could not discover that my terse english faulty enough though it was lost anything in force from translation into the mercurial tongue
the word tongue is used with reservations for of course tongue that language was not
difficulty was experienced in getting a suitable mercurial equivalent for the good english word cracksman
finally however i hit upon three quick touches of the swearkey which made the word intelligible in my own ears if not to any ones else
soon i began to observe a little throng gathering across my side of the prison ring listening intently as i practiced
from day to day the throng increased
over on the other side of the ring professor quinn was absorbed in cutting all manner of scientific capers with his wordbox
the mutability of newtonian law formed his staple theme and he was able to put it through the keys with amazing variations
but no crowd gathered to listen to the professor
the mercurials were all on my side of the compound
thus it was clear to me that my brand of science was more attractive to the little people than the professors
while the mutability of newtonian law languished for an audience the manual was fast acquiring one that taxed the capacity of the wordbox
the professor for a long time had been so wrapped up in his attempt to master the mercurial language that he had paid little heed to me and my efforts
the attention my work was securing however finally caused him to sit up and take notice
halting his weighty remarks he laid aside his talk machine came over to my side of the circle and stood behind me listening
the first i knew of his presence was the reaching of two angry hands over my head and the snatching away of the instrument on which i was at that moment reciting the ten rules for a cracksmans success
my audience was as greatly put out as i was myself
while i was leaping to my feet and whirling around my listeners were clamoring on their wordboxes for me to proceed
professor quinn whitefaced and in a greater temper than i had ever before seen him held my talking apparatus over his head and seemed of a mind to clash it down on the earth at his feet say professor i called restrainingly do anything rash
mr munn he gasped his voice thick with suppressed emotion is my confidence in you to be destroyed utterly
i singled you out as one of the worthiest of all those brought from terra and yet i find you busily inculcating false ideas of personal property into the keen minds of these mercurials
for shame sir
would you demoralize this planet
would you turn these lawabiding people into thieves
professor i answered your ideas and mine do not harmonize on this matter of property rights
while i admit mr munn he answered that conditions on our own planet in a measure condoned your actions yet i maintain that you have no right to air your ideas in njambai
here the conditions are of an altogether different sort
so far as i have been able to learn this orb has not fallen under the noxious spell of the monopolists
you have no excuse for instructing the mercurials in the alpha and omega of your contemptible profession
contemptible
i repeated
that is a hard term professor
besides they seem to be fond of the instruction
everybody listens to me while you havenot had so much as a corporals guard to enjoy that astronomical stuff you have been playing off on your concertina
your line perhaps is more attractive than mine and the shadow of a smile curled about his thin lips for the notion of getting something for nothing has a direct appeal to every thinking being
on the other hand my thesis on the mutability of newtonian law requires profound thought before it can be assimilated
yet be that as it may i shall not allow you to degrade these people with the unworthy ideas that have been coming from your wordbox
i can destroy this machine sir and i shall do so unless you promise never again to let an ignoble thought come out of it
what do you say
your mere command is enough professor i replied
it is not necessary to couple it with a threat
his face softened and he at once returned to me my talkproducer beg your pardon mr munn said he have confidence in your word and know that i can trust you
thereupon he went back to his own side of the ring and i applied myself assiduously to undoing any evil my illconsidered practicing may have wrought
i told the mercurials that my utterances had been in the nature of a fairy story and i gave the lie to my convictions by declaring that the reasoning as in all fairy tales was unsound
from that hour my audiences vanished
the professor although his talk was profound and somewhat wearying seemed to the mercurials as more worth while and they flocked to hear him
we began acquiring a knowledge of the country and of its people and institutions with our very first lesson
in two weeks we had gathered most of the information that follows their planet they called njambai their country was baigol
baigol was one of four kingdoms comprising the underworld of njambai
the other three kingdoms were baijinkz baigossh and derived from the root word bai signifying planet
there were only two places on njambai where water was able to collect and defy the absorbing power of the sun
these places were at the two ends of the planets axis corresponding to the polar regions of earth
here there were seas feeding rivers that ran through the underworld and irrigated the fields
the kingdoms of baijinkz and baigossh lay on the shores of these seas the former at the north and the latter at the south
they were the only kingdoms on the outer shell of njambai and levied tribute from the interior kingdoms of baigol and baigadd for water rights
the distribution of light and heat throughout the nether kingdoms was by a system of gigantic reflectors located at either end of a radius drawn through the equator
there was one stupendous reflector on either side of the planet measuring no less than twenty spatli acrossa spatl being the equivalent of a geographical mile
these reflectors we were told followed the sun as it moved through the heavens and reflected heat and light to countless other reflectors ingeniously placed to acquire and radiate the solar energy
the heat thus secured was further intensified by the planets shell which forming the vault of the nether kingdoms constantly diffused warmth
the king was golbai the nine hundred and twentyfifth of his line
the name of the pompous gentleman whom the professor had christened captain goldman was ocou
names of people places and things as here given are simply a rude equivalent as nearly as can be rendered into english
from my wording the astute reader will probably discover more than the six basic syllables of the baigol language
the flexibility of the wordbox will account for this and the inconsistency is only seeming and not real
baigol had one half the inner sphere and baigadd the other half
these two kingdoms were not on the best of terms owing to a wretched piece of business carried out by gaddbai king of the other country which will be adverted to later
the four kingdoms were connected by a railway if such the mode of transportation could be called
the roadbed was a groove and the wheels of the cars were solid spheres with axles pierced through their diameter
on these axles the carriages were supported
for a people so wonderfully progressive the baigols were strangely backward in their motive power their trains being dragged by handrelays of the small creatures taking them in charge
owing to the diminished force of gravity large weights were easily handled and a fair rate of speed was developed by the train haulers
but it was a very primitive method of transportation
the trunk line connecting the nether kingdoms was known as the baigadd and baigol interplanetary system
when two weeks of our enforced stay in baigol had passed a startling rumor was wafted from the wordboxes of the other kingdom to the effect that the management of the line had secured a wonderful new traction power of tremendous speed and unlimited endurance
the kingdom of baigol was agog with excitement for the president vicepresident and board of directors of the interplanetary were to take a trial spin over the road in a special equipped with their new motive power
we had not yet been allowed to leave the mysterious circle which imprisoned us but we could stand erect and so overtop the fields and houses that we were able to see the railway station
billiard balls came rolling in from every direction clustering about the right of way and clambering to roof tops and other elevations that would afford an unobstructed view of the centre of excitement
at last far off the professor and i heard a thunderous shout toot toot
no wordbox could have been the source of that echoing cry
the professor gave a gasp and clutched my arm convulsively
do you recognize that voice he asked hoarsely
merciful powers mr munn how could such a thing happen
look
look
over the fields beyond the city leaping along at fiftyfoot bounds and dragging behind him a train of queerlooking cars crowded with officials of the system came no less a person than emmet gilhooly
the professor threw himself at the barrier that hedged us round
he could not pass although he struggled frantically
take it coolly professor i urged grasping and holding him upright
but this is outrageous mr munn he cried
poor gilhooly
is he the new traction power the other kingdom has been talking about
how does he happen to be here
and why are they treating him like that
this must be stopped my wordbox
his eyes swept the ground
glimpsing his talking machine he dived for it and began working the keys like mad
no one paid any attention to the furious language that went up under his frenzied fingers however
leviathan in harness absorbed the entire attention of all the baigols and with another toot toot the railway magnate galloped out of sight
it was a sad spectacle indeed
i was almost as completely unmanned by it as was professor quinn
let it not be supposed that we had given no thought to our companions in exile during our two weeks probation in baigol
the professor and i had talked of them frequently wondering whether they were alive or dead and if alive where they were and what they were doing
our story had been punched out of our wordboxes for the benefit of the baigols but had not seemed to make much of an impression on ocou or on others who came to see us
now the sight of gilhooly would add corroborative detail and we harped on that key until ocou promised to communicate directly with king golbai and find out what his wishes were in the matter
as for the professor he wanted to go roaming the four kingdoms looking for the other exiles first visiting baigadd and appropriating the motive power of the system
the most we could get from ocou was a promise to learn his majestys pleasure in our affairs and while we were abiding the kings decision other events took place which were of prime importance to us
ocou had a queerlooking machine borne to our home circle which was the humorous fashion in which the professor referred to our prison ring
the machine was an upright shaft measuring some three feet in height
to its base was attached a golden cord several yards long and terminating in a small silver disk
professor quinn and i were consumed with curiosity while this contrivance was being set up and made ready
we put a question through our wordboxes but were only smiled at mysteriously
presently i was made to sit down turk fashion while one of attendants came to me and passed the silver disk over my head
one end of baton had a black tip the other a white
as the disk passed over my head ocou rested the white tip of the baton on the pedestal
instantly a slide flew out of the shafts top bearing a painted ideograph
the professor and i were not up in the baigol ideographs and were very much surprised at the actions of ocou and his companions when they looked at the slide
they recoiled stared at me suspiciously and moved about me with caution
i grabbed my wordbox the matter anyhow
i asked
we have just discovered that you are a robber said ocou am no robber here i answered no matter what i was in the place i came from
once a robber always a robber retorted ocou unless you touch the bolla
well well murmured the professor rubbing his hands delightedly over the pedestal and giving little heed to remark
what do you call this machine mr ocou
that sir ocou replied is a character indexograph
we find it very useful in cataloguing the natural tendencies of subjects of the realm
he sighed
the number of indexographs in the kingdom is limited and they have all been working overtime of late
this is the first opportunity we have had to use one on you and your friend
now professor if you will oblige me
the professor dropped down the disk gliding over his bald head and another ideograph shot into sight
ah murmured ocou reading the sign philanthropist scientist a man to counsel with do sir but your he shook his head sadly as he dropped his talking machine suppose said watching ocou and his attendants make off with the indexograph that i shall be kept within this circle indefinitely
let us hope not mr munn rejoined the professor laying a kindly hand on my arm
rather let us hope that you will experience a moral rejuvenation so that when the indexograph is tried on you at another time it will show a different result wish they would try that thing on archibald meigs
i exclaimed
the baigols would find i think that i have no monopoly on that particular ideograph
the professor laughed quietly
let us see what comes to us now after we have been catalogued said he think they have simply been waiting to make trial of our tendencies before allowing us to pass out of this enchanted circle
ocou came back in a couple of hours carrying a roll of parchment in addition to his baton
he came alone
gentlemen said he in his mechanical way your names have been entered and tagged
in accordance with the information secured through the indexograph a task has been set for you
perform that task faithfully and you are to have the freedom of the realm
what is the task mr ocou inquired the professor
you are to restore the sacred bolla to his majesty the king of baigol
and what is the bolla
it is the stone of happiness and peace
merely to touch it restores a mortal to health physical and moral
crime is a contagious disease and since the bolla has been lost to us and untouched of any in the kingdom lawlessness has become widespread
where is the bolla
it was loaned some seasons ago to the king of baigadd who now refuses to return it
as baigadd is a more powerful country than ours it would be an act of destruction for us to make war for the stone
so our king has graciously decreed that mr munn shall proceed to the neighboring kingdom and steal the bolla taking you along with him professor as adviser and general aide
nothing could have pleased us more
as i have stated elsewhere in this narrative stealing property from some one to whom that property does not rightfully belong can hardly be accounted a crime and when property thus purloined is restored to its rightful owner the theft is transformed into a high and noble act
such a task filled me with enthusiasm and i was ready to go forth among the fourhanded enemies of baigol and demonstrate my abilities
the professor thinking of gilhooly would have welcomed any undertaking which carried him into the neighboring realm
ocou told us that the king of baigadd was a very grasping individual although he was very careful to abstain from touching the bolla
had he touched the wonderful stone so great was its power that he would have experienced a change of heart immediately and could not have shirked returning the property to its rightful owner
king gaddbai was very wealthy according to ocou drawing his revenues principally from the kaka industry of which he had a monopoly
ka was a fibrous plant from which kaka the only cloth known in the four kingdoms was made
this plant would grow nowhere else than in baigadd so that the people of the other three kingdoms had to go to baigadd for their kirtles
every time the king of baigadd suffered a pecuniary backset or donated a large sum to charity he recouped his exchequer by boosting the price of kirtles
there was a time ocou declared when all the inhabitants of njambai went clothed from neck to heels but wardrobes dwindled as the price of cloth rose
very few people could now afford the luxury of a full suit and since the upper half of the body could not be covered with a garment it was covered with paintthe paint being usually of a color to match or harmonize with the kirtle
a variety of black kaka was the only serviceable material to be had for writing purposes ideographs being traced on its surface with white ink
we were told how gentlemen once wealthy but who had fallen upon evil days had drawn upon their libraries for wearing apparel
books of poetry essays travel fiction all yielded their leaves to the making of various garments thereby clothing the body as comfortably as they had already clothed the mind
what could be more apropos than a morning gown inscribed with choice ideographic sonnets
or a students robe begemmed with the brilliant wit of an essayist
or a traveling costume bearing an account of some voyage of discovery
the only fault to be found with this arrangement was that such clothing advertised the wearers poverty and in njambai as in terra the pride of wealth was most pronounced
king gaddbai it appeared had so enhanced the cost of black kaka that literature lay languishing
writers had not the requisite material on which to inscribe their thoughts and the four kingdoms were threatened with a blight of ignorance
from what we heard of king gaddbai the professor and i were not disposed to regard him very favorably
he seemed a greedy and unscrupulous person more than ready to swell his coffers by trampling on the rights and the welfare of others
the parchment roll brought by ocou was a map showing us how to direct our steps in order to reach baigadd
ocou also delivered to us a royal banner direct from the hands of king golbai which was to procure us favor en route and entitle us to be received and cared for as ambassadors when we reached the other kingdom
the professor asked for a baton but this was denied him
the baigols feared i suppose to trust such a terrible weapon in the hands of aliens
the professors pleasure over the prospect of being allowed to leave our prison ring and journey in search of our friends while seeking the bolla was marred somewhat by revelations
he had hoped to find njambai free of monopoly and greed and yet here was king gaddbai boosting the price of kaka whenever the whim struck him and he had hoped to find a people where poverty was unknown and yet he discovered how the educated were obliged to raid their libraries in order to cover their nakedness
human nature professor i expounded is the same all over the universe
if a man finds himself in a position to gouge his neighbor he is as apt to do it on jupiter or mercury as he is on terra am grievously discouraged he sighed
furthermore said my practicing on the wordbox could not have caused the havoc you imagined it might
ocou tells us that since the bolla has been taken from baigol lawlessness has been widespread and increasing
your rehearsal of the false sentiments contained in your book may have helped on the lawlessness
i am more sorry than i know how to express in finding among this gifted people some of the worst elements of our own civilization
and my regret is the more pronounced on the score of popham meigs gilhooly and markham
how do they figure in your disappointment
i queried you understand he cried had the same hopes of them that i had of you
suppose we found on this planet not a trace of monopoly or greed suppose we had found here a peaceloving justiceserving people with plenty to eat and wear needing no laws to govern them and all happy and contented
the moral effect upon you and the rest of our friends would have been uplifting
you would have seen admired and coveted the same conditions for our own orb
a change would have been worked in you and for the better
that he went on passionately is the full measure of my disappointment
so far from finding such conditions mr munn you are immediately catalogued as a thief and given a task commensurate with your supposed abilitiesa task or robbery
but a righteous robbery i averred
recovering stolen property and returning it to the rightful owner is a meritorious act
we must call it so he answered bitterly since so much hangs upon our joint attempt
but what a lesson for these poor benighted people
the ability to get the stone is beyond them and they call upon us i pursued
their action is flattering rather than otherwise
if we succeed it means that we shall stand even higher in their estimation
we who ought to know better are making ourselves living examples of successful thievery
the end justifies the means professor
we must strive to think so suppose gilhooly has been catalogued the same as you and and that he was found to stand so high in traction affairs that they let us not dwell upon poor gilhooly
he is just where he ought to be i declared only wish he had a glimmering of sense still left him in order that he might realize his position
the effect would be salutary
this frank expression of my views rather startled professor quinn
he walked back and forth his hands clasped behind him and his head bowed in deep thought
the indexograph is a most remarkable invention he finally observed and would be of inestimable value on our native planet
the detection of crime would be an easy matter and on the testimony of the indexograph alone justice could be meted out without the intermediate application of the courts
furthermore justice would never miscarry hope i exclaimed in a panic that i shall never live to see the day when the police officials of terra are equipped with indexographs
it would prove a knockout blow for my profession
every citizen would be tested and his proclivities jotted down in black and white
that would mean expanded the professor that crime would be relegated to the limbo of lost arts
before a lawless act could be committed the artist in crime would be placed where the deed would be impossible the way i figure it out professor
but that is not the least of the indexographs merits
children could be duly catalogued and if they showed criminal tendencies could be sent to institutions for proper moral training
the inclination of the young toward certain trades could be learned and they could be given instruction along the line which would best serve their future careers
there would not be so many failures in life mr munn
perhaps not i answered stubbornly but i still maintain that the overturning of our customary standards would land us in chaos
tut he exclaimed half angrily
some day i trust your angle of vision will change materially
until that time mr munn it would be well for you to repress your peculiar views for you are going to be sorry for them
just three weeks to a day from the time we reached baigol we fared forth from the royal city bent upon the performance of our mission
we were armed only with our wordboxes the kings standard and a firm determination to achieve our liberty by securing the bolla no matter what the cost
our journey led us through a pleasant country level for the most part and covered with irrigated fields growing the white blossoms which the baigols gathered and cooked for food
the kings will as made known by the banner secured us rest by the way
i have not considered it necessary to refer to the fact that there was light and darkness throughout the kingdoms of baigol and baigadd during each period of twentyfour hours and three minutes
light and heat were sent through the underworld by means of the two huge reflectors already mentioned and when the sun passed from the heavens of course night fell
but the climate was at all times delightful
we were armored against the temperature and could not ourselves experience the equable air yet our eyes and ears assured us of its presence and this proved another surprise for the professor
by day we traveled and by night we rested often covering as many as five hundred spatli in a single day
four days at that rate were to carry us to the capital of the other kingdom
i gathered much wisdom from the professor as we journeyed and there were two of our conversations which made a deep impression on me
the first had to do with the reflectors that turned the suns rays into the bowels of the planet
without the sun mr munn remarked quinn indicating the white fields beside us with a gesture of the hand there could be no vegetable life in baigol
those fields must be quickened to life by the solar rays or they would be as barren as the outer shell of the planet
finite ingenuity may always be trusted to accommodate itself to its environment
i can set the astronomers of terra right on one mystery at least
what mystery do you refer to professor
i asked
why he answered a luminous point has been detected by earthly telescopes on the disk of mercury
the phenomenon has been explained as a huge mountain whose top reflects the sun yet it is only one of the great reflectors fabricated by these ingenious people
then at another time professor said have you made any discoveries relative to that powerful little weapon which the baigols know so well how to use few he answered
the baton is called a zetbai and its ammunition is drawn from a peculiar ingredient of the atmosphere
the white tip of the zetbai furnishes the destructive force while the black tip combats and nullifies it
the inhabitants of this orb mr munn have a weapon of such awful power in the zetbai that a dozen of their number armed with the batons could descend upon our own globe and devastate it
well is it for terra that means are lacking for interplanetary communication otherwise the baigols and their fellowcreatures might prove the napoleons of the universe
such a contingency is terrible to contemplate
had the zetbai anything to do with that invisible power that stayed us from crossing the circular wall
it had everything to do with that
an unseen barrier was placed around usa barrier of zet drawn from the atmosphere by these baigols and made to serve their ends
unlike powder and ball which destroy themselves in creating destruction zet is indestructible it can be regathered into the zetbai and used over and over again
the resisting medium controlled by the black tip of the baton is alone powerful to annul the energy of the white tip
these were the points that impressed me
another which we discussed but which did not appeal to me as logical or accurate had to do with the object of our questthe bolla
with all due respect to mr ocou said he was certainly talking moonshine when he described the bolla would not go so far as to say he was talking moonshine mr munn the professor answered
there are stranger things in heaven earth and mercury than are dreamed of in our philosophy
take yourself for instance
you are a sick man never sick in my life i declared mean morally went on quinn
if crime is a disease you will admit i think that you are sick
no i averred am healthy in mind and body
i take no stock in mr assertionswhich ought to prove that i am mentally sound i take it
but well get this palladium just the same for our liberty depends on it
toward noon of the fourth day as we drew near the boundaries of baigadd we entered a rocky and uneven country the welldefined road we had been following cutting and circling through the low hills
when we were well in among the bowlders a frantic shout reached us from around a bend in the road a few spatli ahead
that was a cry in our own tongue mr munn exclaimed the professor coming to a halt
did you not hear it
it was certainly a call for help
you are right sir i answered
that was a lusty english yell if i ever heard one
it was given by one of our friends of course
no doubt it is not hard to distinguish a human voice from the bleat of one of these baigol wordboxes
possibly the new motive power of the interplanetary has rebelled and is fleeing this way
no answered the professor excitedly do not think that shout came from gilhooly
it was ah mr meigs
at that instant archibald meigs came bounding into sight around the bend
but he was not the wellgroomed richly appareled mr meigs of earth and the steel car
his only garment was a kirtle
he must have been surprised at seeing us but so great was his fear that he did not show it
panic left no room for any other emotion
quinn
munn
save mesave me from the soldiers
a few dozen prodigious leaps brought him trembling to our vicinity and he fell exhausted to his knees
my my cried the professor
what has happened mr meigs
how is it that we find you in condition a wretched man wailed meigs grabbing the professors knees in the stress of his emotion
you have got to save me professor quinn
it was you who brought me to this awful planet and if i am slain my blood will be upon your head
that was meigs for you
even in his dire extremity he did not forget to heap censure upon the head of our great savant
you are not going to be slain said the professor confidently
but these creatures are as venomous as centipedes murmured meigs suffering himself to be lifted erect by the professor
horrors
there they come now
oh this is too much too much
meigs got behind the professor
turning our eyes toward the bend we saw a detachment of the baigadd army just hurling itself into sight
we had made some acquaintance with military affairs in baigol
soldiers as may be surmised were armed with zetbais but wordboxes were kept out of the ranks
only officers carried talking machines matters being ordered on the principle that privates were to hear and obey
each soldier wielded two zetbaisone with each pair of handsthereby enormously increasing his capacity for destruction
the fighting force of baigol we had been informed although organized on a smaller scale was equipped and maneuvred exactly as was the military arm of baigadd
the detachment approaching at a doublequick in pursuit of meigs was as we afterward found a company of gaddbaizets or royal guards
they numbered fifty wore yellow kirtles had the torso gilded and were commanded by a single officer carrying nothing but a wordbox
the sight of the professor and myself caused the gaddbaizets to come to an abrupt halt
they had undoubtedly heard of us but they were far from expecting to encounter us there at that time
the officer was the first to recover his wits and approached the place where we were standing holding his talking machine over his head and punching its keys vigorously
his first words were a command to the soldiers hold your zetbais and make no move against these fierce colossi until you get further orders from me
then to us behemoths
whence come you and why are you protecting the monster in the red kirtle
meigs it could easily be seen was not on familiar terms with the wordboxes
so far as he was concerned the captains words fell on deaf ears
we are from baigol said the professor giving an amiable twist to his words by a deft use of key and come on an errand from the king of that country
this gentleman is a friend of ours friend screeched the captains machine
he is a thief and has stolen a hundred djins of kaka from our sovereign storehouse
i thrilled an amused laugh on the seventh key of my own machine
how do you know he is a thief
i asked
did you try the indexograph on him do the talking mr munn said the professor in our own tongue then added to the officer there must be some mistake captain
this gentleman has a very good reputation and would not commit a theft such as you describe
he bears the proof of it upon his person answered the captain
it is the kirtle
now a djin is a unit of measurement and corresponds to the inch of our system from which it follows that meigs stood convicted of stealing about eight feet of red kakaenough to make kirtles for a score of the baigadds
what are you harping about asked meigs
they say you are a thief mr meigs said thief he blustered glaring at the captain over the professors shoulder deny it sir i deny it
he says you stole that kirtle you have on i continued man has a right to clothe himself as well as he may answered meigs aggrieved do not count that theft
the country should see that a man is provided with a respectable covering
this was too good an opportunity for the professor to let slip
suffer your mind to drift back to your own planet sir said he
it is your opinion that our government owes every poor man a suit of clothes
archibald meigs cringed under the blow
it was a thrust at his clothing trust and it found the weak point in his armor
circumstances are different here he mumbled
in some ways yes in other ways no
king gaddbai is the monopolist of this planet
he controls the kaka output and charges for it accordingly
the captain of the royal guard was growing impatient
if you are here on an errand from the king of baigol said he we shall be glad to escort you to the capitalbut not until you have surrendered the giant who stole the kings property
take us to his majesty returned the professor and we will explain everything in a satisfactory manner
but this the captain would not do and he became so threatening that we retreated behind a barrier of bowlders
display the banner mr munn said the professor and i held up the royal standard so that the captain could not help but see it
his one eye gleamed insolently and he came as near swearing as the seventh key of his wordbox would allow
deliver up the thief he ordered or i will command my men to annihilate you with their zetbais
it was certainly a critical situation
i had already had a slight experience with the overpowering properties of zet and didnot care for further acquaintance with it
meigs was nothing to me
he would have stripped the coat from a poor mans back if he could have had his way on earth and it afforded me secret pleasure to see him hoisted by his own petard
the trust magnate did not fail to take note of the warlike movements of the soldiers you do anything to save me professor he pleaded
we shall not give you up answered quinn firmly
can you think of any way mr munn whereby we can extricate ourselves from this difficulty
i have a quick mind if i do say it and a happy thought presented itself on the spur of the instant
stooping i picked up a stone then raising myself i let the missile fly straight at the captain
his shoulderarms still held the wordbox above his head and the stone smashed against it and carried it away
it was rather neatly done for the captain himself was left untouched
bravo cried the professor
you drew the fangs of the enemy by that trick mr munn
you have rendered the captain mute and his men cannot act without orders
i had already figured this out in my mind and it was presently proved that i had not gone far from the mark
the captain recovered the wordbox and attempted to use it but its mechanism was so disarranged that the order to attack became a confused jumble that seemed to sound a retreat
the whole company whirled and fled their leader following and gesticulating wildly and helplessly with his arms
meigs was saved for the present and he should have thanked me for itbut he did not
seating himself on a bowlder he gazed pensively down at the red kirtle
this is what i call the irony of fate said he in a morose tone
and then on top of it all to be called a thief
he leaned his bare elbows on his knees and dropped his face in his hands
how did this happen mr meigs asked the professor gently
happen cried meigs lifting his head with a jerk and glaring at quinn
it would never have happened but for you
have you seen gilhooly went on the professor ignoring the reproach
poor gilhooly sighed meigs
he has become a power in the traction interests of the country
the last i saw of him he was hauling trains throughout the kingdom
we know that much already
how about popham and markham
alas groaned meigs
popham is working like a galleyslave in a coal mine and these little fiends are slowly starving him to death
all markham does is to wander about the kingdom with a plate and a paddle begging food enough to keep body and soul together
think of it
and the great augustus popham owner of a controlling interest in all the great anthracite and bituminous fields of earth delving in the mines of this planetno better than a miner
coal fields
i exclaimed
what do they need of coal in these underground kingdoms
they use the coal in the kingdoms of baijinkz and baigossh which are situated at the poles explained the professor
during the long nights in those countries a certain degree of cold must prevail here quinn turned again to us what happened to you and the other two gentlemen during the storm which separated us
we managed to regain the car replied meigs
we could not get in of course because you had the key but we hung to the latticework at the windows
i am a little hazy as to what happened after that but i think the car must have been picked up by a terrific gust and thrown to the bottom of that crater in the volcano
ah murmured the professor looking at me
you remember mr munn i told you i feared something of the kind would happen
i nodded
proceed mr meigs added the professor
this is all intensely interesting
was the car seriously damaged havenot seen the car resumed meigs hiatus followed the blowing away of the castle and when i opened my eyes again i was a prisoner in the hands of a legion of those oneeyed creatures
for two weeks i was kept confinedan object of curiosity for the whole kingdom if i could judge from the way the little imps flocked to stare at me
after a time i was led off to a place where i joined popham and markham
need i tell you how affecting that meeting was
popham shed tears and both markham and myself were nearly unmanned
our captors had some sort of a contrivance consisting of a small shaft and cord
one end of the cord was put to head and a slide flew up on the end of the shaft
then markham was led off given a plate and paddle and cast adrift
popham was the next one to have the queer machine tried on him
when he was removed my turn came
meigs wrung his hands despairingly
after the storm he continued with an effort my costume was not as complete as i would have had it but those impudent creatures denuded me still further
in selfdefense i was forced to steal this red cloth and run for my life
oh it was terrible
woe is me that i should ever have lived to see this day
some good may come out of this unfortunate experience mr meigs said the professor
good almost shouted meigs
sir you express yourself strangely
is it good to have a man used to such luxury as i have been fleeing through these rocky underground hills merely because he committed theft in order to retain his selfrespect
have a care sir
do not think for a moment that i am under any misapprehension as to the real cause of my sorry situation
the king of this country is evidently a man of a humorous and practical turn observed professor quinn after a little thought
the indexograph made him familiar with the natural bent of you three gentlemen and he is seeking to show you the error of your ways
on earth you were at one end of a trust here you are placed at the other end
really i think the experience will prove most wholesome
archibald meigs stared at the speaker with distended eyes
is it possible said he that your brain has been turned like nonsense
i struck in
the professors head is as clear as a bell got the right of this thing meigs
the king of baigadd is making you take a little of the medicine you measured out in such large doses on the other planet
you are both crazy snarled meigs never stripped a man to his hide and threw him out in the cold worldas the king of this country has done to me in a figurative sense
you donot know how much evil you have done said quinn an expression on his face similar to the one i had seen when he jerked the lever and shot us into the unknown
you have taken your pound of flesh mr meigs but are now under the heel of a monopoly yourself
stuff cried meigs
we will talk no longer about a matter in which you display such poor judgment
although i have told you my story i have heard little of yours
am i to conclude that you and munn purposely cut loose from myself and my friends
after bringing us to this miserable planet did you have the heart willfully to abandon us
not at all meigs said the professor hastily
i wondered if meigs had forgotten all about the attempt he and his friends had made to abandon the professor and me
he was one of the most inconsistent men i have ever encountered
like yourself and the others mr meigs continued the professor mr munn and i were taken prisoners but you were not treated with the same barbarity as the rest of us burst out meigs his small mind finding even that a cause for temper
you who engineered the plot and plunged us all into these terrific difficulties escape the consequences
what is that banner
we are under the protection of the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of baigol
that is the royal standard
ah said meigs bitterly you are even received at courtyou and a professed thiefwhile markham popham gilhooly and i are no more than outcasts
is there no such thing as justice even on this disgusting planet
look at me
look at me his final request for us to look at him was a frantic wail
he yanked savagely at his kirtle and twisted his bare feet around in fearsome dejection
we are looking at you mr meigs observed the professor quietly
do you find any pleasure in the spectacle
does not my situation arouse even a spark of pity
i do not ask munn for his sympathy but you professor quinn although criminally careless in evolving plans and carrying them out are a scientist and you must have a heart
my heart is wrung with your misfortunes replied the professor gently but i realize that desperate diseases require desperate remedies
what disease are you referring to snapped meigs suddenly changing his tack and what remedy
the disease that afflicts our common country and which you would deny and ridicule were i even to name it
the remedy too you would consider no remedy at all but a useless infliction of discomfort and mental anguish
what you are undergoing mr meigs is not accidental but providential
the workings of fate are as marvelous as they are effective
patience a little and we shall see what we shall see
this is no time for oracular remarks scowled meigs
these fourhanded oneeyed demons are forcing gilhooly markham popham and me steadily toward destruction
gilhooly daft as he is is pulling his heart out on their ugly little transportation system markham is galloping from place to place pounding his paddle against his dish and begging a few morsels of food popham is working like a galleyslave and his wages already insufficient to give him the necessary food he requires for his heartbreaking labor are being systematically cut down as for me the army of baigadd is at my heels
baigadd and in his extreme discouragement meigs gave vent to a wild mirthless laugh
baigadd and baigol
they sound like expletives from our own good planet but altogether too mild to express the state of my feelings
be calm adjured the professor with an apprehensive look at me
calm echoed meigs brokenly shall be as mad as gilhooly if this keeps up much longer
he started forward with a truculent air
what are you going to do for me quinn he cried
how are you going to get me out of this fix
those infernal little soldiers went away but theyll come back again
then what
we are here in the role of ambassadors answered the professor and munn an ambassador sneered meigs drawing away from me
and as such we are entitled to some courtesy at the hands of king baigadd
i feel quite sure that when the higher authorities understand you are my friend they will be lenient in their treatment of you
that is rather a vague supposition on which to ground a mans hopes of life or death muttered meigs
it is all we can fall back on mr meigs
there are but six of us on this small planet and we must make the inhabitants our friends
if we do not annihilation will overtake the lot of us
we were fools ever to land on mercury in the first place pursued meigs still wild and unreasoning
he stamped with his bare foot to emphasize his anger and a sharp stone unexpectedly gave point to it
with a howl of pain he caught his foot in his hands
i have never been called particularly hardhearted but somehow i took a measure of enjoyment out of all this
however i had the grace to turn my head and conceal the smile
you must be careful mr meigs warned the professor
sit down and rest yourself
rest fumed meigs just as though such a thing were possible
i am one of the miserable victims of your duplicity and if i could have recourse to the law of our planet for about an hour i would soon put you where you belong
be sensible i struck in perhaps illadvisedly
you act like a whipped schoolboy meigs hear nothing from you he cried glaring at me
as i was saying mr meigs proceeded the professor mr munn and although we appear to be free are nevertheless virtual prisoners of the king of baigol
we are being sent to baigadd upon an important mission and on our success or failure depends very largely that will do interrupted the broker irritably donot care to hear an account of your experiences quinn
it is evident i think that you and munn have not been crossed by the same adversity which has overtaken myself and the others
i have a demand to make
meigs arose from the bowlder and struck an attitude which he intended to be both dignified and compelling
with his unshaven face and red kirtle he succeeded only in making himself ludicrous
what is the demand inquired quinn
you and munn are fairly wellclothed replied meigs and i demand that you share my distress to the extent of donating enough of your own clothing to make me presentable
on the impulse of the moment the professor began removing his coat
when the garment was half off he changed his mind and slipped back into it again
no he returned
you have made your own bed mr meigs and i think you should lie in it until you experience a change of heart
when you can truly say to mr munn and me that you realize how sadly mistaken you were on the other planet we will share your distressbut not till then
out on you for a pair of heartless wretches exclaimed the broker angrily
your reasoning is false and i will never yield assent to it
i wash my hands of both of he went through the if our paths should cross in the future it is my desire that we pass as strangers
he glared at us turned on his bare heel and made his way to the road
then he strode off in the direction of the bend
we watched him silently the professor with apprehension and i with unrestrained enjoyment
as he was about to vanish from our sight we saw him come to a startled halt gaze off along the road that lay beyond the bend then throw up his arms whirl and race back to us coming he shouted frantically the whole army is coming
is there no way you can save me gentlemen
think for mercys sake think
meigs was continually building barriers between himself and the professor and me only to knock them down again whenever the slightest danger threatened him
had i been the one to decide he should then and there have been left to shift for himself
have courage mr meigs said professor quinn
it is my hope that some high personage may be with the approaching army in which event the royal banner given us by the king of baigol will be respected and prove the salvation of all three of us
this great and good man was utterly incapable of harboring resentment against any one
he beguiled the plutocrats into his castle i grant you and shuffled them from the scene of their grievous labors yet this was not because he loved the rich man less but the poor man more
as i write these words piecing my narrative together out of my commonplace book a wave of affection and reverence rolls over me
and often i steal forth o nights when skies are propitious gaze at mercury through my telescope and can almost fancy myself in communion with the gentle soul forever lost to its native planet
but i anticipate
the retreating gaddbaizets had reached headquarters and acquainted the high chief in command with the fact that two more colossi had appeared so the major part of the kings forces had been ordered out
by tactful maneuvres they were approaching from all sides
a cordon was drawn around usa cordon of soldiers with their flashing zetbais presented
one hostile move would have placed the seal on our death warrant
the high chief perhaps fearing his wordbox might be wrecked as his captains had been had evidently laid plans and given all orders in advance of his attack on our position
the assault was noiseless swift and sure
when completely surrounded by the troops a number of the soldiers disengaged themselves from various points of the circle
these soldiers carried lances at least ten feet long
the lances were held high and to the point of each the upper edge of a net was made fast the lower edge of the net trailing along the ground
as the lancemen advanced the net took the form of a rapidly contracting circle the professor meigs and myself in the centre
in less than five minutes we three colossi were stoutly encompassed by the net hurled together and thrown in a helpless jumble
the web was finely woven and of a material that defied our efforts to break through it
professor quinn made a fierce attempt to use his wordbox but he was held so rigidly that he could not do so
one by one we were disentangled the upper parts of our bodies were wrapped about in sections of the net so that only our legs were free and we were forced to proceed with our captors the army marching on every side of us
meigs was loudly bewailing his evil fortune
take heart man cried quinn
if i can see the king or get word to him i am sure that all will yet be well all day with us returned meigs with a groan and you cannot make me believe otherwise
there was no twilight in the nether kingdoms
day leaped into night as swiftly as a curtain falls on a stage play
long before we reached our destination we were in stygian blackness
there were no artificial illuminants known to the creatures of the underworld and they had no need of them
their single eyes were gifted with power to see at night almost as keenly as in the daytime
when we had traveled several hours we were made to halt and a circle of zet similar to the one that had imprisoned quinn and myself in baigol was reared around us
thereupon we were freed of the nets and left to ourselves
the instant he was able to make use of his hands the professor grabbed his wordbox and began shooting questions into the opaque gloom that hemmed us in
why have you taken us prisoners
what harm have we ever done you
we are under the protection of king golbai
did not the captain of the other detachment so inform you
answer came back you have been taken prisoners because you resisted the royal authority and tried to protect a man who stole goods from our regal master
theft of goods from his majestys storehouse is punishable with death
even ambassadors from king golbai are not above the laws of our realm
what is to be our fate
zet was the laconic answer
you will all three be slain by the executionergeneral as soon as may be after the great reflector sends its first gleam of day through the kingdom
that ended the professors talk with our unseen enemy who presumably was the high chief of the forces
it was sufficiently discouraging although i was reckless enough to ease my feelings with a few expletives on key 7the most insolent and defiant that i had learned in baigol
mr munn mr munn cried quinn in rebuke
this is no time to express yourself in that key am not endowed with your magnificent forbearance professor said and i had to say something it all about anyway asked meigs
we are to die at sunrise meigs i answered roughly or as soon after sunrise as the executionergeneral may find it convenient would have spared mr meigs that information said the professor
he ought to have time to prepare himself i returned
as the night is far spent i am going to turn in and snatch forty winks against the time the reflectors begin to work
good night professor i added as i stretched out on the ground donot amount to much more than meigs and will never be missed but i am sorry for you
quinn groped for my hand
life in itself is a small thing said he no matter whether it is long or short
it is what we do with life that counts mr munn have no regrets for what i have done with mine i declared
and i had not
conscience did not accuse me in the least
never had i taken a penny from those who could not afford to lose it
think again mr munn implored the professor would not have you face your doom in that mental attitude
surely your senses are not blunted to the evil of your past life
sir i answered imbued to the core with the sophistry that had made me what i was have been a financier in a small way
not having the requisite capital for large operations i was compelled to work in a small way
my business however while it may not have been as legitimate was every whit as honest as that of meigs and his associates
if you men would stop that useless palavering called meigs from somewhere in the dark and try to think of some way for making our escape you would be putting in your time to better advantage
never mind him professor said this is probably the last opportunity we shall ever have for an extended talk
at such a time a man speaks from the heart and i want you to know just where i stand
just a moment mr munn
the professor turned his head to answer meigs
it is impossible for us to escape said he
even if we could get away from here we should find the entire country in arms against us
possibly we could get back to that other benighted kingdom from which you and the thief come accredited as ambassadors returned meigs
it is a hard journey from here mr meigs and we should be overtaken and recaptured before we could cross the border into a friendly country
before we could take to flight however we should have to beat down the barrier of zet that hems its in
that as i know from experience is out of the question
meigs began to complain and to find fault and the professor turned from him and went on talking with me have brought these troubles upon you mr munn he continued a sad note in his voice and upon the others
it seems impossible to accomplish any great good without causing some small amount of misery let my situation worry you i remarked
while constantly exercising my wits to secure the best fortune for myself i have always made it a point to be prepared for the worst
i shall face the zetbais in the morning without the quiver of an eyelid misunderstand me mr munn said the professor earnestly
while i grieve that matters should have fallen out in this fashion yet i would not undo the one thing which brought us into these troubled waters
in other words i would rather be here in njambai with death staring us in the face than back there on terra with meigs markham popham and gilhooly free to work out their nefarious plans the spirit
i cried warmly the spirit that has put many a man in the penitentiary called meigs who appeared to be following our conversation even if he was not taking any part in it
i turned with a stinging reply on my lips but the professor dropped a hand on my arm and i held my peace
we are sharing together our last few hours said he and let us have no quarrelsome talk
personally i have a good deal of charity for meigs
he is a man who until very recently has been accustomed to having scores of people wait upon his slightest nod
here he has been subjected to much indignity and at the hands of a people whom he believes to be his inferiors
naturally that renders him disagreeable
he might at least have the grace to leave you alone i answered
not so mr munn
he is perfectly right in badgering me
i am at fault so far as he and his associates are concerned and he knows it
i do not expect approbation at their hands but at the hands of those in faraway terra whom my drastic actions have helped
your calm acceptance of your fate is so different from the attitude of meigs that it touches me deeply
you have the same cause to blame and abuse me and yet you let the opportunity pass
it has been worth something professor i responded to stand at your side and to pass through these remarkable adventures shoulder to shoulder with you
thank you for that my friend have no doubt i continued that if you and i were to be spared you might in time lead me to see what you are disposed to call the error of my way for you are a master hand at arguing but as i am at present i feel that my chances in the next world are as good as any ones
the rich have taken from the poor in a way that the law sanctions and i have taken from the rich in a way the law does not sanction and in a few rare instances have given to the poor nothing in that to oppress my conscience
the only thing i am sorry for is that i entered your castle with my felonious intention centred upon your property
now that i know you so well my plan to steal from you looks more like a crime than anything else i have done
munn he replied it grieves me to think that your career is to be cut short before you have had an opportunity to reform he sighed is no escaping fate on our own planet or on this
good night to you
i was dogtired and went off into slumber the moment i closed my eyes
about the last thing i heard was the peevish voice of meigs resisting what little comfort the professor tried to offer him
i was aroused by the professor
the first gleam of day mr munn said he bending over me with a quiet smile
i rubbed my eyes and got the cobwebs out of my brain
yes it was the first gleam of dayour last day
we were in an open square in the heart of a diminutive city
from every side radiated trim little streets bordered thickly with white dwellings
in front of us was a palace rising dome upon dome until it stood full thirty feet high
inhabitants of the royal city were already abroad walking rapidly or gathering in groups and using their wordboxes excitedly
toot toot
the familiar sounds came from a distance and i sprang erect and with the professor gazed in the direction from which they reached us
presently gilhooly came along with a loaded train
he halted in front of the palace the passengers disembarked and gilhooly bent over the cars picked them up carefully and turned them the other way along the groove
all aboard he cried and a minute later he was off and away
poor gilhooly murmured quinn
he is bringing excursionists to witness our execution
i am glad that he does not know what he is doing and that meigs is asleep
quinn laid his hand on my shoulder deeply regret mr munn he went on that i am the indirect cause of lunacy
it was a great surprise to me to find that his intellect was not strong enough to withstand the ordeal to which i subjected it
it couldnot be helped professor i returned
it was a grand idea of yoursthat of abducting these trust magnates and placing them where they could do no harm to the poor of our planet
what though one mind has been wrecked
better that than the misery and enslavement of hundreds of thousands
mr munn said the professor with feeling thank you
such words from a companion who is about to suffer jointly with me the extreme penalty prove that you are a man of parts and fitted for a nobler walk in life than the one you have heretofore taken
i am very very sorry that you are to be cut off so soon
quinn was fortitude itself his courage born of a knowledge of duty well done
i am prone to believe also that i myself was not less firm although a less laudable cause lay back of it
the square i should judge measured about two hundred feet on each side
while the professor and i were engaged in talk sightseers had been gathering in the streets keeping carefully to the sidewalk boundaries of the open space
every eye was turned upon the professor and myself and the sleeping meigs
the broker was snoring dismally the sound rumbling above the babble of the wordboxes and echoing through the adjacent thoroughfares
what has happened to the executionergeneral
i said to the professor
he isnot very punctual in keeping his engagement with us it seems to me
we have had daylight for an hour
something has gone wrong mr munn quinn answered taking note of a ripple of excitement that ran through the crowds around us
ah
here comes the high chief of the military forces
he has his wordbox ready so i suppose he is going to explain
the high chief was pushing through the throng into the square two of his hands holding a wordbox and the other two a zetbai
advancing upon us he halted just without the ring
be patient gentlemen he said through his talk machine
you will not be kept waiting much longer
we are not so wildly impatient as you seem to think i sent back at him whereupon he tittered a little with key seeing that i was getting ready to use the same key for a few expletives the professor made haste to break in
what has happened he asked
it has just been discovered that there is no white paint in the kings storehouse replied the high chief
what is the white paint to be used for came curiously from the professor
the executionergeneral is obliged by law to give himself a fresh coat of white paint at every execution
it would be impossible for him to perform his function without first complying with the statute
could not some one else who has been freshly decorated do the work in his stead
i inquired somewhat flippantly
no answered the high chief
he is the only one in the kingdom who is duly empowered to execute criminals
our executioner is a proud person and jealous of the prerogatives of his office
he receives no less than two kanos for every happy dispatch that he performs
in this case he will be the richer by six kanos so you will understand how anxious he is to have everything done as it should be
a kano was the equivalent of a half cent of our own money so that our onetime millionaire mr archibald meigs was to yield up his valuable life and help swell the income to the extent of a single copper
had he been awake i should have explained the matter to him so that he might have still further expatiated upon the irony of fate
this kingdom of baigadd differed from the other kingdom with which we had already made acquaintance in one material respect the surface of the country had shrunk much farther from the outer crust of the planet
in baigol for instance we were always able to see the vault that covered us but in baigadd the sight reached into nothing but empty space
shortly after the high chief had finished speaking there came a flourish of wordboxes from the direction of the palace
turning our eyes toward that point we beheld two resplendent soldiers in turrets to right and left of the richly hung balcony
hail to our munificent sovereign gaddbai ruler of the realm and mightiest monarch of njambai
thus the pans of the soldiers
the words were echoed by the crowd and a surging roar went up from the talking machines hail to his majesty king gaddbai
on the heels of the tumult the kaka draperies parted at the rear of the royal balcony and the king appeared bowed and seated himself
he had a reserved seat for the performance and could see everything that took place
let the executionergeneral stand forth prepare himself for his work and then proceedall in the royal presence
instantly the master of ceremonies put in an appearance
he wore a white kirtle carried himself with a lordly air and was followed by a retinue of attendants
two of the attendants bore the official zetbais another carried the official wordbox four more were dragging a cart on spherical wheelsan open cart laden with an object that startled us
great heavens mr munn gasped the professor
unless my eyes deceive me the executionergeneral is having my tub of antigravity compound hauled after him
your eyes do not deceive you sir i made answer
but what in the world are they going to do with it
we shall be able to tell in a few moments
look
the executioner takes his wordbox and kneels he is about to address the king
your majesty said the executionergeneral through his talking machine your slave craves your indulgence in the matter of preparing for this happy dispatch
the supply of the official pigment is quite exhausted and it has been found necessary to fall back upon the white paint that was found in the dwelling recently fallen from the top of the crater
will it answer the purpose demanded the king
it is white your majesty and of proper consistency
so far as i can see it will answer the purpose well
then proceed with your preparations
i would have this matter over with as quick as possible
of course quinn and i understood all this
i knew that the professor was meditating a final appeal to the king and he shot a strange look at me as his trembling hands lifted his wordbox
before the executionergeneral proceeds your majesty remarked the professor his fingers none too steady will you allow me a word
his majesty gave an exclamation of surprise
where have you learned our language he inquired
in baigol your majesty
we come from that country on a visit to you under the protection of the royal banner of golbai
the professor nodded to me and i shook out the banner and held it aloft
my royal friend said gaddbai should have been more particular in choosing the subjects he sends to visit my realm
the sleeping colossus in the ring with you raided my storehouse and you sought to save him from capture
for that lawless act death has been decreed to all three of you and the sentence must be carried out
but we were ignorant of the law pleaded the professor
ignorance of the law is no excuse
the gentleman in the red kirtle is a friend of ours if we know a person by the company he keeps that speaks ill for you interrupted the sovereign
you are determined to have us slain your majesty
it is my royal will
then i shall have to set forces at work to combat the royal will said the professor calmly
cries of consternation and anger went up on every hand
the king rose wrathfully from his seat
you dare to dispute my authority he demanded dare to dispute your ability to slay us returned quinn
your executioner will disappear from before your eyes if he attempts it
the king laughed ironically
we shall see he said sinking placidly back on his seat
let the executionergeneral proceed with his preparations
i was greatly pleased with the drift of affairs
circumstances had conspired to favor us and the professor was making the most of his opportunity
the executionergeneral motioned to one of his attendants and then raised his four hands above his head
a moment later the attendant had seized the whitewash brush dabbed it into the antigravity compound and with two quick strokes had covered the executioners chest and back
had a third stroke been needed it could not have been given
in a flash the official had been snatched away vanishing like a streak of white in the void above
the king rose gasping clutching at the balcony rail
the throng around us was paralyzed for a space and not a wordbox was heard
as for quinn he had struck an attitude his left hand raised aloft and his glittering beadlike eyes transfixing the king
and through all this archibald meigs slept placidly on
presently a perfect roar of awe and dismay broke from thousands of wordboxes
in the midst of the hubbub the king could be seen waving his hands to command silence and attention
the glittering soldiers in the turrets sounded a clarion warning and silence fell once more
marvelous are the powers of these colossi cried the king with trembling voice
the sleeping thief receives my royal pardon the offense of his two friends in attempting to succor him is condoned
from now henceforth these three are my honored guests
let all take heed
i caught the professors hand and gave it a fervent clasp
you saved our lives professor said hardly he returned smiling
it was the antigravity compound that did that
now that we can inflate our lungs without catching our breath suppose we waken mr meigs
on being aroused meigs sat up and stared around at him
he was not long in picking up the trend of events where he had left off during the night
are they ready toto kill us he asked clasping his hands
they are not going to kill us mr meigs answered the professor
the king has changed his mind and we are now his honored guests
you donot mean it exclaimed the broker
the professor replied that he did mean it and went on to tell how the unexpected result had been accomplished
before he had fairly finished the king clad in his robes of state and accompanied by a dozen members of his household could be seen approaching across the square
attendants followed the royal party bearing basins of food a chair on which his majesty could repose himself and a canopy to shield his august person from the reflected rays of the sun
the first thing you do quinn said meigs while the royal party was making itself comfortable tell the king got to have my clothes
have patience mr meigs answered the professor
patience spluttered meigs
merciful powers man
how can i be patient and cut such a figure as this
attend his majesty came from a wordbox among the kings suite
our gracious sovereign is about to speak
our close attention being secured the king remarked now that these colossi have been spared they will need food
see that it is given them
this command was very satisfactory to me for i was little short of famished
presently our paddles were flying over the basins and we were breaking our fast in a way that made the king open his eyes
the lord of the exchequera most important officer of statedrew near his majesty and said that if the kingdom was going to board us for any length of time it would behoove them to till all the crown lands and get every available acre into produce
the king made answer that the little man with the beady eyes was a wonderworker he had taken care of the executionergeneral with a mere wave of the hand and no doubt he could with a stamp of the foot materialize as much food as he wanted and whenever he wanted
the lord of the exchequer thereupon retired in much confusion
in the midst of our repast we were startled by a voice behind us
gentlemen gentlemen
out of your abundant store will you not have the goodness to give me a few mouthfuls of food starving literally starving
markham cried meigs whirling around
mr markham exclaimed the professor
the foodtrust magnate was fully clad although his clothing showed signs of much hard usage
his cheeks were sunken and pale while his eyes were round and abnormally bright
in his left hand was a metal plate and in his right a small paddle
both meigs and quinn started toward markham with the food that still remained in their basins
the zetring however reared its intangible barrier between so that markham could not so much as touch the receptacles extended toward him
it was pathetic to watch this onetime master of millions struggling to get the coveted food
he would throw himself at it and recoil trembling from the mysterious force that had shocked and baffled him he would sink to his knees or leap in the air trying to reach above or below the invisible barrier and then he would dissemble slink toward the basins and make a sudden dash as though the strong chemical was an enemy whom he thought he could take off its guard
at last he gave over and turned away with a despairing moan
meigs faced the king and began an angry outburst which the professor made haste to interrupt
your majesty said quinn this needy gentleman is also a friend of ours
will you not supply his wants or enable us to do so
the indexograph informed me as to his character answered the king and it is a law of the realm that punishment must fit the crime
when your friend will truly acknowledge himself in the wrong his needs will be plentifully supplied
until that time he must beg his food from house to house morsel by morsel
and this other gentleman in the kirtle proceeded the professor will you not exercise a little clemency in his case have already exercised a good deal of clemency the king answered nor can i go any further until he also announces a change of heart
markham was as deaf to the wordboxes as was meigs and his majestys will was interpreted to them am not in the wrong declared markham
the principle involved is of vital importance and i will die for it if need be
so will averred meigs
we will eliminate your friends from our calculations for the present said the king
just now i would like to know what has become of my executionergeneral
he is pinned to the roof of the underworld said the professor
can you bring him back asked the king turning his eye aloft
really i donot see how we are to get along without him
possibly i can return him to you answered the professor will try at least providing you will grant a request i have to make
this dallying with the royal prerogative was not well received by his majesty nor by those around him
what request would you make in case i was inclined to receive it asked the king would have you bring out the bolla and allow these two gentlemen to take it in their hands
the king gave a start and a look of consternation overspread the faces of those in his retinue
where did you hear of the bolla the king asked sharply
in the other kingdom your majesty the professor replied
the king was silent a few moments
we will take that matter up later said he finally
from whence come you and your friends
that point has been bothering me for some little time
we come from another planet which is called the earth said quinn
does the planet you speak of circle around our sun
yes your majesty
is it as large as njambai
much larger your majesty
and are all the creatures on earth twohanded as large as you and able to communicate thoughts without a wordbox
the inhabitants of earth are just as you see us
but they do not live beneath the crust of the planet
the suns rays are so tempered by the time they reach the earth that beings are able to live in comfort on the outer shell
the king clapped two of his hands at this and gave other evidence of his pleasure on the wordbox
most wonderful he exclaimed and launched into a series of questions concerning the physical attributes of our mother planet and the character and institutions of its people
quinn answered him fully expatiating on the progress in arts and sciences already made by the earth dwellers
the kings wonder grew into awe and admiration
rising from his chair he paced back and forth in front of us thinking deeply
what sort of weapons have your people he inquired at last
the professor described our machines to the best of his ability
the king was puzzled they know anything about zet on your native orb he inquired
no answered the professor
there is no zet in our atmosphere
suppose a company of my soldiers were to land on earth fully equipped with zetbais
could they be resisted
quinn shuddered
no your majesty they could not be resisted
with your wonderful zetbais you could conquer and lay waste the entire planet
candor compels me to tell you this knowing full well that such a result would not be possible to you
why impossible cried the king with wild enthusiasm
you and your friends must have come hither in that strange house which fell into the crater
why could i not load a company of my soldiers into the house and go back with you
then and only then did we see what this crackbrained monarch was driving at
quinn was in trepidation over the outcome
such a thing is not to be thought of he cried
your majesty let me beg you not to give your attention to such a quixotic project am fully resolved exclaimed the king striding up and down with clinched hands
it is a very alluring picture you give me of this planet called earth conquer it annex it and own it
he halted and raised his wordbox
ho there olox he cried
the high chief stepped forward and made the royal salaam of four hands
we are going forth to conquer the solar system olox paid the king in a brisk way
yes your majesty answered olox as readily as though the capturing of a planet or two was an everyday occurrence
you have overheard what this strange twohanded creature has been telling me went on the king
yes your majesty
trains that burn the black blocks and need not be hauled by hand
green vegetation laughing rivers and babbling brooks all on the outer shell
rich cities stores of art and heaps of yellow gold
these and myriad other marvelous things are on the earth olox and guarded only by twohanded fivefingered colossi who have to load a tube of iron with black powder and round missiles before they can attack their foes
the king threw back his head and laughed on the wordbox
taking a cue from the king olox also laughed and so did the others
and these earth dwellers canot even see in the dark rippled the king with contemptuous fingers
but they are large your majesty ventured the high chief
large and therefore awkward not quick like our people olox
the zetbai is the key to the situation
we could girdle the green star of these colossi devastate it and destroy all who sought to oppose us
that is what we shall do
it will be a noble campaign your majesty
noble
that is not the word olox
it will be stupendous monopolize everything when we get there my dear sireverything we can get our hands on
and i guess we can get our hands on whatever there iszet will clear every obstacle out of our way
the king looked at the theoretical side
olox naturally had an eye to the practical
what are your orders for the campaign your majesty he asked shall leave a regent to look after baigadd said the king and myself accompany the expedition
you will be the military head olox
yes your majesty
we are to go in the metal house
it is the only thing we have to go in
the metal house was unhurt by its fall into the crater
that appears to be the case your majesty strange as it may seem
it fell into the kingdom right side up and the interior is in good condition
very good your majesty
my orders to the effect that nothing should be removed from it have been carried out
the executionergeneral would have that tub of white pigment
nothing else has been taken from the house
very good
how many of our people will the house contain comfortably should say that fifty or more could dwell in it without much inconvenience
then select fifty soldiers the flower of the gaddbaizets
among your stores be sure you have a good supply of black kaka
i want some one who is away up in ideographs to accompany the expedition as historian
it will be attended to your highness
the king turned and aimed his wordbox at the professor
is that tub of white pigment essential to the proper equipment of the metal house he asked
very essential replied quinn
three weeks and more in the nether kingdoms had whitened us considerably but the professors face was now a sickly grayish color
then i will have it taken back to the house said the king
he gave orders to that end at once and the cart was laid hold of and drawn out of the square and down the street olox accompanying it had no idea the king drummed on his wordbox that there were any people in the solar system with so much wealth and so little power with which to guard it got the other three kingdoms of njambai pretty well under my thumb and the regent i leave behind to boss things will have an easy time of it
quite possibly i may conclude not to come back to njambai
this other star has natural advantages which we do not seem to have here and may prove a more comfortable place in which to live
professor quinn was shivering like a man with an ague
he proceeded to use his talkmachine and the words shook under his unsteady fingers
what you are thinking of your majesty ran the professors words is only the wildest of dreams have had dreams before and wild ones the kings wordbox rattled off complacently and i have made them come true
it shall be the same with this
i am a conqueror and i come of a line of conquerors
there are millions upon millions of people on our planet persisted the professor despairingly
they could hurl these countless numbers against you faster than you could slay them with your zetbais
key of the royal wordbox gave a screech of contempt
suppose we draw a line of zet the box added when the derision had died out imprison groups of those countless numbers and then wipe them out by detachments
how would that work
the atmosphere of earth is different from that of mercury continued the professor
you cannot draw zet from the air of our planet
thanks for the hint replied the king
we will take an ample supply with us and charge the atmosphere with it
then we shall have a store at hand whenever the need develops
while the king was using his wordbox with two of his hands he was rubbing the other two together with illconcealed delight
conditions there are absolutely unknown to you your majesty persisted the professor in a frantic endeavor to turn the king from his designs
you will be brought face to face at every turn with situations that will puzzle you and be fraught with danger
all the nations of the earth will combine against you
let them combine was the monarchs answer hope they will display sufficient strength to make the campaign exciting
i will capture this earth of yours and rule over it
from one end of it to the other i will make it mine
i have long felt that njambai was too small for the proper exercise of my wide abilities
this is your world the professor thumped angrily on his wordbox and you have no right to meddle with any other planet
that caused the king to turn his keen eye on the professor and to keep it there for a full minute have the right to do whatever i see fit snapped his talk machine
there is no will in this kingdom but mine and no other will in the four kingdoms if i choose to have it so
but why are you saying such things on your wordbox
after firing me with a kingly ambition to capture and annex a distant planet why do you proceed to throw discouragement in my way
ha
i wonder if you have been telling me the truth
your majesty hummed the professors talk machine with dignity am not in the habit of making misstatements find out whether you are or not came from the king
this is an important matter and i shall take no mans word for anything
ho there and the wordbox was leveled at some of the retainers bring an indexograph varlets
we will settle this question of veracity here and now
some of the retainers scurried away and vanished inside the palace
presently they reappeared with the indexograph
the professor was backward in facing the teststrangely backward as i thought for a man so clearminded and conscientious
the test is not necessary he demurred
your actions are far from being open and aboveboard remarked the king
you must submit
the royal eye was on the machine as the professor was tried out
the ideograph told of a truthful mind sadly perturbed
the royal wordbox chattered mirthfully
you are afraid i can accomplish my purpose laughed his majesty
you are worried about your planet
such a state of mind merely enhances my determination for you if i mistake not are a clever man
you would not feel worried if you did not believe i could accomplish what i have in mind
but be at peace my dear sir
you shall in nowise suffer
i will make you ruler of one of the captured kingdoms
this was no lure for the professor
he maintained an attitude of dignified silence watching the king with steady eyes wise general went on his majesty always looks over his ground as well as he may before going out to battle
that will be advisable in the case of my present campaign
what do you mean by that your majesty queried the professor explained the king again we shall mount to the upper crust and make a reconnoissance of this orb i am to subjugate
have you any astronomical instruments asked quinn
none whatever replied the king
have you
there is an instrument in the steel car which will bring the planet terra much nearer to us than the naked eye could do
what is it
describe the instrument to me and i will have it brought out for our nights work
the professor described the telescope and the king dispatched a messenger after olox in hot haste with supplementary orders
thereupon the king bade us farewell and left the square followed by his suite
as i stood watching the royal party out of sight i heard a gurgling groan behind me
facing about i saw the professor reeling unsteadily the next moment i had caught him in my arms and saved him a fall
a professor quinn did not become unconscious
the frightful catastrophe that threatened terra had preyed upon him at the expense of his strength
easing him to the ground i dropped beside him and held his head on my knee
cheer up professor said it surprises me to see you give way like this
mr munn he returned brokenly if this rattlebrained monarch goes out into the universe with a picked company of fifty men and a hundred zetbais it will mean that the whole solar system will get a setback to a period corresponding with our middle ages
these creatures of njambai are far beneath those of terra in civilization and fate has placed in their hands the terrible zetbai a weapon whose destructive powers are beyond compute
oh mr munn think of our government being overwhelmed by these fourhanded oneeyed creatures
think of the wordbox screeching through the lofty corridors of the capitol at washington where the soulstirring eloquence of senators and representatives has been thundered amain
think of the the professor could give no added touch to the harrowing picture
throwing his hands to his face he groaned aloud
this hasnot happened yet said no but it will happen unless we can do something to circumvent the mad scheme
anarchy will reign in our beloved landover the whole earthand i will be held responsible
ah me
in removing the trust magnates i have but paved the way for a mightier monopolist
i have but followed the sad example of frankenstein for out of my plans has sprung a monstrous project that will check progress and hurl civilization back five hundred years give up hope said but not very cheerfully for i was greatly cast down
let us pretend to help them
we will lend our aid in making the car ready and then at the final moment perhaps we can dart away and leave them behind or failing in that we may be able to throw the zetbais from the car while in space
that will pull the fangs of the baigadds i think and they will land on earth as harmless as a lot of kittens
the professor took heart at this
he would have rallied any way for his resourceful nature could not struggle long in the slough of despond
archibald meigs had been circling around the edge of our barrier seeking for another glimpse of markham and even calling his name with all his lung power
but the foodtrust magnate neither answered nor showed himself being engaged in a canvass for the pittance of provender that would keep him alive
meigs finally turned to us and demanded the cause of the professors downcast air
quinn revealed the kings plot and meigs tore off into an outburst of recrimination just as i expected he would do
the professor bowed his head meekly to the tempest and even restrained me when i would have put a stop to the brokers intemperate language
by and by we had our noon meal and with the attendants who brought it came olox seating himself on the ground and watching us as we ate
the high chief was quite amiable and i began asking him questions relative to our surroundings
he indicated the kings private apartments in the palace and pointed out his own residence as well as the dwelling occupied by the late executionergeneral besides vouchsafing other information of interest
what is that small square building under the wing of the palace
i asked
that is the imperial exchequer said he
within that building the king keeps the most priceless of all his treasures
and what is that inquired the professor
the bolla was the startling answer
quinn and i exchanged expressive glances
here through a chance remark by olox we were suddenly reminded of our duty to the king of baigol
it was necessary that olox should not see the startled looks which the professor and i were exchanging and mercurial eyes were preternaturally sharp
bolla
i allowed to come limpingly from the talk instrument
what may that be stone answered olox and there was suspicion in his manner in spite of my attempt to avert it
you already know of the bolla
your friend requested his majesty to have it brought out and at that time you said that you had heard of it in the other kingdom
so we did i replied trimming my sails to another breeze but what is it
our information is rather vague stone as i just said went on olox
it has a beneficial moral and physical effect on whoever touches it
where did it come from
it has been in njambai for ages was the indefinite answer
how did king gaddbai get hold of it
he borrowed it from the king of baigol
and yet you call it one of his treasures
if it was borrowed olox how could it possibly belong here
king gaddbai has taken it was the calm response
what he wants he makes his own
if king golbai had not loaned the stone there would have been a war
was that the right thing for your king to do inquired the professor
whatever our sovereign does is right
there was no getting around a flat statement of that sort
evidently the ruler of the country had drilled his subjects thoroughly
what did you do at the car olox said the professor
at the iron house
the professor nodded
nods and gestures were well understood by the people of njambai for with four hands they were well equipped for finger and whole arm movements
the kings orders were carried out at the iron house finished olox
the paint was returned to its proper place
even so
and the telescope that matter was attended to trust you handled the telescope with care
it is exceedingly fragile and could be easily injured
after the king spoke as he did death by zet would be meted out to the one who injured the instrument
there were several things i wanted to ask olox and the principal one had to do with gilhooly and the way he had been taken from the car and made to serve the traction interests of the kingdom
however the professor was keeping olox so busy with his wordbox that my own questions were crowded out
the family of the executionergeneral are anxious to have him returned remarked olox while the professor was looking for the proper key on which to formulate his next question
could that be accomplished
it might replied the professor guardedly
what has become of him
he disappeared as he was about to commit a deed of base injustice said the professor grimly
we are aware of that and olox looked uneasily around as he punched the words but we are ignorant of the cause of his disappearance
he is a distant relative of mine and i promised his next of kin to put these questions to you
is he alive
undoubtedly
olox pressed closer and muffled his wordbox so that the sounds could not carry to dangerous limits
if you would tell us how to proceed in the matter of getting the executionergeneral back he whispered can promise you and your friends help in getting out of the country
look out for the indexograph olox said if they should happen to give you a try out with it the ideograph wouldnot look well to the king
olox was greatly shakenso shaken in fact that he could not pursue the subject further will talk with you later about the executionergeneral he finished noting the empty dishes before the professor and meigs and me and the curious manner of those who had come with him
until then pray consider that nothing has been said on the subject
with that he arose and beckoned to his companions
after olox had led the attendants away with the empty food receptacles the professor and i got our heads together on the mission that had brought us to baigadd
we did not think it necessary or advisable to let meigs know of our purpose in regaining control of the bolla
we are pledged to secure the mysterious stone if we can mr munn said quinn
undoubtedly the work will put us in bad odor here and may interfere with our attempt to balk the king in his comprehensive scheme of conquest but that does not release us from the task in question
a tingle of gratification shot along my nerves
the feeling of oppression that had burdened me was lifted for i ever loved to crack a professional nut and here was one that would certainly try me to the utmost
i surveyed the small building with critical eyes
here is where my inches get the better of me professor said for one of my size to get into that house is out of the question
and i wouldnot know where to lay hands on the bolla if it were physically possible for me to effect an entrance can make a suggestion mr munn said quinn which would get you safely around that difficulty
what is that
whisper
i inclined my ear to his lips
why not run away with the imperial exchequer
eh
i gasped
steal it bodily i mean
when you get to baigol with it let the king effect entrance secure his bolla and then you return the exchequer to its original location
of course it would be very wrong to steal the kings treasury and i would not counsel that under any consideration
you merely borrow it to obtain the bolla the stone returned to its rightful owners you return the exchequer
and get zetbaied for my pains
i exclaimed
let us hope said the professor that before you can get zetbaied we shall be in a position to use the car and escape from the planet
i gave much thought to the matter
it is a long chance i returned frankly but i have been taking long chances ever since i became a cracksman
i will put the plan in operation professor at the very first opportunity that presents itself
thus we left the matter the professor warmly congratulating me on my courage and expressing the hope that i would prove equally courageous in more worthy pursuits if the chance ever offered
day slipped along to its close and shortly after the reflectors winked out the king came accompanied by olox a guard of gaddbaizets and six attendants bearing the telescope
to our surprise and gratification both markham and popham were in the midst of the royal guard
it struck me said the king graciously that your friends might also wish to view the orb from which they came
it is a little thing and can be done without inconvenience so i am pleased to favor them
the high chief traced an opening in the zet ring with the black tip of his weapon and meigs was first to rush through and hurl himself into the arms of popham
the unfortunate gentlemen were long in each others embrace
when they finally drew apart meigs groped through the black gloom by markham while the professor felt for the coal barons hand and gave it a gentle and reassuring pressure
professor quinn said popham am being badly treated
the king has put me on the night shift in one of the royal coal mines and the soldiers make me work like a galley slave
this is the first night i have had off since they set me to work
popham was loud in his complainings but was cut short by the king
we must proceed gentlemen
i have word from above that the night is fine and everything propitious for an excellent view of your planet but storms come suddenly and we can never be sure of the weather on the outer crust
it is well to make haste
we started stumblingly each of us led by a soldier to whom the way was plain
we were jostled here and there through the gloom and finally were made to mount some object which gave a metallic ring beneath our feet
this is the royal lift explained the king
when the heat of the day is suspended i often go above
he then addressed himself to olox
give the signal at once
the signal was given and we shot aloft
the transformation from the fury of a storm to the light and tranquillity of the underworld had been great and astounding but this second transformation was none the less impressive
we emerged into a wonderful night set with stars that were perfectly familiar to me
the dipper and polaris were in the north and occupying relatively the same positions that they do when viewed from little effect has the immensities of distance upon their posts in the vault
but our own globe
it hung huge and tremulous in the blue of the evening sky so plain that we could almost note the continents that gemmed its surface
meigs gave a whimpering cry and he and markham and popham rushed together fell upon each others neck and wept aloud
oh i wish i was back i wish i was back moaned the broker lonesome enough to die sobbed markham
exiled exiled exiled was all the coal baron could murmur in husky tones
i will not say that i was proof against the sentiments that had unmanned the onetime magnates but i will declare that both quinn and myself had our feelings under better control
in silence i assisted the professor to plant the telescope and we each gazed longingly at the greenish star magnified to many times its diameter the united states cried popham
can you see new york whispered meigs hoarsely
look for new york man
of course a view of new york was out of the question but the frantic explutocrats imagined they could see it and even look down into wall street for aught i know
again were their emotions too much for them and they gave way as they had done before
mr munn said the professor this is harrowing
it is pretty hard on those gentlemen i returned to be brought face to face with something they thought they owned and yet not be able to possess it
that remark is unlike you answered the professor and turned to the king thought occurred to me while we were coming up on the lift he went on and i should like you to explain
if it is in my power answered the king his eye to the telescope
when we dropped into the kingdom of baigol there was a storm on the surface of this planet
that storm must have hidden the sun and yet the reflectors below were sending day throughout the realm
the reflection came from other and smaller reflectors arranged to take care of just such an emergency explained the king
storms are only local you know and when one gathers over the giant reflector the smaller ones at the other points are brought into use
but lets not talk of this planet but of that other one up here
and along that line the kings conversation ran for a full hour
at last when we were ready to descend so far from being dismayed by the enormity of the task before him the royal zealot was fortified in his resolution to carry it out
his majesty was in great good humor and when we had left the lift and marched back to the square he very graciously tendered us the freedom of the town
he could not understand why the professor and i should have any desire to escape from his country and inasmuch as he had made us his honored guests to return us to the circle of zet would be to besmirch his hospitality
the zet had been regathered into the high chiefs zetbai and it was not again released
it was not necessary for popham to return to the royal mines until the following night so he remained with us along with markham and we all bunked down in the centre of the plaza
is there no way professor quinn quavered popham whereby we can escape from the inhuman monsters who people this planet
the treatment i have suffered is monstrous
i feel as though i shall die if i have to go back to those royal coal mines again
being a large man they expect me to do the work of a dozen mercurials
there are blisters on my hands and my feet are so sore i can hardly walk
this wail from the brusque and tyrannical popham was in itself a highly edifying comment on his sad experiences
your position was grace itself compared with mine mourned markham
these people seemed determined to starve me to death
i am expected to travel from house to house begging food and they hardly give me enough at one house to take me to the next
you are on the surface returned popham and you are not delving continually in the hot unhealthy regions where i must do my work
i have to toil like a galley slave for a cent a day and a cents worth of this vegetable food which seems to be all they have here does not furnish me with enough strength for my labor
you have your clothes at least whimpered meigs
quinn ought to help us he must help us shall do what i can gentlemen said the professor wearily have not succeeded in showing you the error of your ways but i must let that pass
a greater calamity menaces our planet than any you could possibly let loose upon our devoted country
meigs was saying something about that spoke up popham
what is it this mad king thinks of doing
why with fifty warriors armed with zetbais he intends making an attack upon terra
he hopes to conquer our mother orb
popham gave a faint cry of derision
why if that rascal ever landed on our planet said he he and his warriors would be captured out of hand and turned over to some museum for exhibition purposes
if happened to be around at the time of their capture he finished angrily would send every last one of them into mines that are mines make them toil with their four hands until they wore them off at the wrists
gad but that would be a revenge worth having
this is not a time to think of revenge mr popham spoke up the professor more in sorrow than rebuke
we have our planet to consider and next to the planet ourselves
our planet is big enough to take care of itself averred markham
leave that out of the question professor and confine your attention to some way in which we can better our condition
the danger that threatens earth is greater than you appear to imagine went on quinn
for whatever happened to our homestar because of king gaddbai and his astounding plans of conquest i should be responsible
the thought weighs upon me and will give me no rest
the king must be foiled
how does he intend to reach the earth asked markham
by means of our car
is that in usable condition came joyously from popham
so far as i can discover it lies intact at the bottom of the crater on whose rim we landed
there is no reason why the car cannot be employed for a return to terra but and here the professors words became emphatic it shall not be so employed by king gaddbai and his army of conquest
i shall prevent that at all hazards
how came hoarsely from the three exmillionaires
by destroying the car as a last resort and when other means fail was the calm rejoinder
you would not dare breathed popham
you would not have the heart to take from us our sole means of escape added markham
madman ground out meigs
if i really thought that you would destroy our only means of salvation you wouldnot do a thing meigs i chimed in
whatever the professor thinks best to do is going to be done and no two ways about it donot want to destroy the car continued the professor unmoved by this storm he had aroused if other means can be made to serve
and i may say that we shall exhaust every effort to make other means serve
i feel that it is my duty to return you gentlemen to the place from whence you were taken
i have not accomplished what i had hoped to do but it is better to be disappointed in that rather than to let king gaddbai get away in the car with his fifty warriors
certainly it is your duty to send us back said meigs and you should consider that duty before anything and everything else
exactly seconded popham and we must take gilhooly with us
if one goes all must go
leave the matter to me gentlemen counseled the professor quietly shall do everything possible
the coal baron and the foodtrust magnate continued to dwell upon their harrowing experiences with various degrees of intensity until a command for silence came from a wordbox somewhere around us
our raucous tones were keeping the people awake all over the city the talking machine averred and unless we became instantly quiet the authorities would take the matter in hand
this threat had the desired result
we gave over our conversation and settled ourselves for the night
i do not know how long i slept but it must have been some hours
i was aroused to find it still dark and to behold the professor with a lighted match in one hand and his other hand over my lips
the burning match threw a fitful glare around the open space and even reached to the roof tops beyond
both the palace and the imperial exchequer were brought shadowily forth out of the gloom
now is the time mr munn whispered the professor
the time
i returned sotto voce
time for what
without a word he pointed to the square building under the wing of the palace
i understood
it was now or never if i intended to make my raid and secure the bolla
i started erect
you have matches mr munn the professor asked in the very faintest of audible tones
i nodded
you must be very careful to keep to the street until you reach the country the professor went on
if you should make a misstep and wreck a block of houses the disaster would be irretrievable will strike matches and light my way until i get well into the hills said just what i should have suggested said he
mr munn
fail not to return with the exchequer as soon as the king of baigol has secured the bolla
meantime i shall hope to get the car in readiness to speed our departure
we struck hands as men will when confronted by an issue of life and death
then i stepped into the street bent over the imperial exchequer and wrenched it from its foundations
it was a wellconstructed building and although its contents jingled like a rattle box when i took it under my arm it did not give way in any part
striking a match on the roof of the exchequer i lighted my way down the street picking my steps with care and caution
good fortune fared forth with me from the royal city and remained steadfastly at my right hand as long as the matches lasted but when the last one had flickered out and left me in impenetrable gloom my troubles began
i was well into the rough country when the lights failed threading a road bordered by hills that in some places were shoulder high
about the first thing i did was to blunder off the trail in trying to regain it i stumbled over a fivefoot mountain and went down all of a heap
had i fallen on the exchequer i should have smashed it into a cocked hata result only narrowly averted
regaining my feet and smothering some good strong language that rose instinctively to my lips i essayed once more to find the baigol road
i had my trouble for my pains and after an hour spent in fruitless blundering i sat down on a cliff propped up the exchequer on the side of a caon and nursed my barked shins until day began flashing from the reflectors
as i sat there waiting for the light my brain was filled with evil thoughts which i recall with contrition and chronicle with regret
i knew the exchequer must contain the kings wealthgolden pieces of eight of a rare fineness unknown to the mints of terra
i was not of a mind to return the gold after allowing the king of baigol to take his bolla
why not stow the treasure away about my clothes and rely upon my native tact and discretion to get me to the steel car in spite of the grasping monarch of baigadd
i was much wrought up over the way i had lost the loot taken from the plutocrats
in my minds eye i could see those four bulging handkerchiefs waxing and waning about the castle and i had hoped they would fall to the surface of mercury along with the car so that i might still be able to secure them
in this i was disappointed
once the mercurial atmosphere was struck the loot and the revolver had fallen away from the castle like so many pieces of lead
the wallets undoubtedly had been incinerated by the suns rays together with the banknotes that were in them
i imagined that the intense heat had exploded the cartridges in the sixshooter and had warped and twisted the firearm until it was no longer serviceable
the other plunder also even if found could not by any possibility be utilized by me or any one else
all this had made me savagely eager to recoup my finances
and as i sat brooding on the cliff i asked myself why i should not do this at the expense of the baigadd exchequer
i did not arouse myself at the first reflected flash of day
although i had decided to appropriate the contents of coffers i was casting about for a suitable method that would gain my end with the least inconvenience
a maudlin chuckle from near at hand brought me abruptly out of my reflections
i turned and there on a neighboring elevation stood gilhooly balancing the exchequer on the broad of his hand
i was brought up staring
what could the motive power of the interplanetary be doing there at that time
his absence must have interfered sadly with the train schedule
certainly the officers of the system would not have countenanced this neglect of duty had they known of it
then it flashed over me that gilhooly had run away
he had tired of racing up and down the groove with a string of toy cars and had taken french leave of the system
the fire of insanity was still in his eyes and he retreated step by step as i advanced upon him
look here gilhooly said i in my most persuasive tones that building you have in your hands is the imperial exchequer
put it down theres a good fellow juggle with it in that way
suppose you were to drop it
gilhooly had begun shaking it up and down as though it were one of those castiron banks in which children sometimes deposit their coppers the jingle of the exchequers contents appeared to please him
if you want this road you have got to bid up for it said he not so young that i donot know a good thing when got it in my grip
that road has gone into the hands of a receiver i returned humoring his fancy and the receiver
give it here gilhooly was not consulted when the receiver was appointed he answered have rights in the matter and those rights must be protected a deal framed up to beat the pool
my how it rattles and he shook the exchequer again
i was at my wits end
i knew that tact was far and away more effective than violence when dealing with a crazed person
put it down for a moment gilhooly i wheedled and come over to the directors meeting
who are the directors he asked suspiciously
well there are only two one you know and youre the other
he exploded a laugh tossed the exchequer in the air like a strong man playing with a cannon ball and then caught it deftly as it came down the boy to juggle with railroads he boasted
ask any one in the street and theyll tell you
look out
i gasped or youll drop it
not he mumbled never yet wrecked a railroad
where did you come from gilhooly
i asked seeking to get him into conversation while i edged closer to him by degrees
from distant parts he replied been the whole thing for a big transcontinental line that adding to the gilhooly system
he chuckled craftily
they thought they had me but i got out from under with the rolling stock hid the cars in a gully and my next move will be to steal the right of way the big railroad man of the country
just ask anybody who knows whats what in transportation circles and theyll tell you the same thing
i had arrived within a few feet of him and suddenly i leaped forward
but he was wary and sprang aside the exchequer jingling sharply
no you donot said he trying to serve a subpoena on me and too foxy for you
get out of here or have you thrown downstairs
come over to the directors meeting gilhooly i urged turning and walking away from him got to look after your interests you know
but the vagaries of a shattered mind are hard to deal with
gilhooly laughed at me sat down on a rock and took the exchequer on his knees
he was wary and never for an instant permitted me to lose his eyes
you canot fool me he cried so youd better take the next train for home
i hold a majority of the stock and after watered it a little have enough to buy another line easy being a railroad magnate when you know how
clear out you annoy me
gilhooly said with a gentleness i was far from feeling you want to know something about popham know him snarled gilhooly but if hes trying to break into this railroad game just tell him that i control the whole bag of tricks and that its not worth his while
hugging the exchequer in his arms he rocked back and forth and began to sing
well said starting away again if you donot want to attend this directors meeting have to look after it myself
he made no reply but kept on hugging the exchequer rocking back and forth and timing his monotonous croon to the rattle of treasure in the kings strong rooms
warily as i could i circled about creeping on all fours and screening myself by the little hills and ridges
my design was to come up on gilhooly from behind and snatch the exchequer away from him
but he heard me
before i had come within a dozen feet of him he stopped his singing leaped to his feet and whirled around
the next moment he had placed himself at a safe distance too many for you he shouted
go away or call the police
i was in a sweat for fear some of king soldiers would locate us and develop their zetbais
one flash of that violet fire would do the business for both gilhooly and me and the professors cherished plans would go by the board
besides i had plans of my own and it seemed as though gilhooly was destined to make a mess of everything
oh come now i cried in a bit of a temper
that wonot do you any good gilhooly
it doesnot belong to you and you havenot any right to keep it we ever keep anything that donot belong to us he asked sarcastically not that sort of a fellow for i keep everything in the railroad line that i can get my hands on
logic and reason were utterly dead in his mind
whims he had but they were but fancies of the moment
as i stood there looking at him i wondered how the people of baigadd had ever managed to keep him hauling their trains as long as they had he called suddenly taking the exchequer under his arm think go to the office and just then i made a dash at him
with a mocking laugh he whirled about and raced off across the hills myself in hot pursuit course intersected the baigol highway and he turned into it roaring defiantly as he sped along
suddenly he stumbled and fell and a cry of dismay escaped me
he had fallen squarely on the exchequer and wrecked it completely coins the size of a gold dollar and worth five times as muchrolled everywhere about the road diverging from a heap that lay revealed by the collapsed walls of the building
flinging forward i went to my knees and began plunging my hands into the pile
i believe that just then i was as daft as gilhooly himself
in those days the glimmer of gold always had a demoralizing effect on me
as i raked my outspread fingers through the yellow pile i brought up a round jetblack stone the size of my fist
i regarded it as a bit of chaff in the bin of wealth and hurled it from me down the road
with a loud yell gilhooly leaped after it
then i became aware of a weird and inexplicable feeling that laid itself like an axe at the root of my professional instinct
what right had i to all this treasure
it belonged to the king of baigall he was an unworthy creature perhaps but still it belonged to him
what had i been about to do
my heart sickened and i sprang up spurned the kyzicks with my heel and turned my back
that was my awakening
in one instant the iron of repentance had pierced my soul
the past rolled its turgid waters in front of me
i shivered and drew back from that wave of evil covering my eyes to blot it from my sight
how should i atone for the days that had been
could i do it by an unflinching rectitude in the days there were to be
conscience was belaboring me with telling blows
i had not been on intimate terms with my conscience for many years and to have it thus suddenly overmaster me and drive me into reformation was a mystery beyond my power to explain
while i stood there consumed with regret and hoping against hope for the future a voice hailed me from down the road
did you say your name was munn
could that calm contained voice have come from emmet gilhooly
i looked in his direction and found him leaning against a jutting spur of rocks his right hand clutching convulsively the black stone i had flung from me
the crazed light had vanished from his eyes
an expression of wonder was on his face but it was a rational wonder developed by an awakening as abrupt and complete as mine had been
you have it right mr gilhooly i answered the extreme mildness of my voice surprising me
my full name is james peter munn and you are the thief who just came into the castle and relieved myself and my friends of their valuables normal condition had come back to him at the point where it had been dropped
i was not slow in reasoning how this might be was a thief in the letter and spirit less than ten minutes back i humbly answered but now sir i have turned a leaf
i promise you that the rest of the book shall read better than what has gone before
gilhooly passed his left hand across his forehead am he faltered
in the kingdom of baigadd i returned some distance out of the royal city
baigadd
royal city
you talk strangely mr munn
where is the castle
where are meigs markham and popham
and professor quinn
are started forward and looked wildly in the castle
but no that canot be
you just said we were somewhere else
i beg your pardon mr munn
i am confused and hardly know what i am saying
i began an explanation going patiently into every detail and when i finally finished gilhooly knew as much about our situation as i did
for some time gilhooly walked up and down the road passing and repassing the heap of gold
at last he paused beside it
we should return this treasure to its owner mr munn said he and he dropped the black stone on the yellow pile
from what you tell me this is a strange planet and strangely peopled
yet there is superstition here as well as in our native orbas these wonder tales about the bolla will bear evidence think with you sir said the bolla is simply a fetish and its miraculous powers are purely imaginary
that is the sensible way to look at it
suppose we load our pockets with the gold and start back with it to the city from whence it was taken
i assented and suggested using our coats as improvised bags for the easier transportation of the kings wealth and we stripped to our shirt sleeves and set about our work
in half an hour we had collected all the scattered treasure had bound it up in our coats and had started back
gilhooly preserved a pensive silence
his thoughts were far away and he seemed entirely oblivious of the fact that i was trudging along at his side
it was only when we turned an angle in the road and came face to face with quinn meigs markham and popham that gilhooly showed any interest in our present situation
the meeting between gilhooly and his brother exiles was most affecting
in the general joy at finding the exrailway magnate restored to reason the matter of the imperial exchequer was temporarily lost sight of
and i think the man who rejoiced most over returned sanity was quinn
the professors beady little eyes were fairly glowing as he caught and clung to hand after the others had expressed their pleasure and tendered congratulations
this is a glad day for me mr gilhooly exclaimed the professor had taken myself very much to task on account of your clouded mind
your reproach of yourself was well merited spoke up meigs who always had a venomous shaft in his quiver for quinn
small thanks to you that our friend is himself again
gently mr meigs gently came from gilhooly do not find professor quinn in the wrong in any particular
popham meigs and markham regarded gilhooly with openmouthed amaze
i think the professor also was startled i know at least that i was
do you mean to say mr gilhooly cried meigs that you can overlook criminal folly in casting us adrift in the unknown cannot only overlook it was the quiet response but i can forgive it
almost i am of the opinion that it was justifiable
faugh rasped meigs
you have not recovered your reason after all or you would not talk that way
let us not engage in useless disputes gentlemen put in the professor
there is another affair to engage us
it was thought quinn went on with an expressive look at me that mr gilhooly had fled the realm and taken the imperial exchequer with him
it was i who took the exchequer said and it is i who hope to return it to the king
what about the bolla queried quinn giving me a sharp look
it is here said touching the makeshift bundle i was carrying under my arm
at least i added there is a strange looking black stone among the gold coins and i suppose it must be king palladium
we were sent forth to look for mr gilhooly and the stolen treasure remarked the professor
olox and his gaddbaizets are likewise on the road but we have been able to leave them pretty well in the rear
what was thought of my absence
i asked
very little mr munn
every officer of the state seemed united in fixing the blame upon mr gilhooly
since he was known to be mentally unsound no crime could be attached to his act shall tell the truth of it i declared
and be condemned to death by zet said the professor gazing at me fixedly
let the king believe what he will said gilhooly should rather have it so since it means so much to mr munn
why did you not keep on to the other kingdom with the bolla inquired quinn of me
because i didnot think i should be doing the right thing i replied
ah
and why this sudden change in your sentiments mr munn canot explain it professor believe it is a theory of yours that one thief has the right to take from another what does not belong to either of them
two wrongs do not make a right
indeed
the change in your sentiments is most suddenand remarkable
will you please untie the sleeves of your coat and allow me to have a look at that black stone
i lowered my bundle and opened it
there said but poorly concealing the contempt i felt for the black stone as i pointed to it
you may take stock in the superstition if you will professor but i will have none of it
the professor gave me a queer smile then picked up the bolla and surveyed it curiously
would you like to look at it mr meigs he asked fetish like this is a sure sign of barbarism observed meigs taking the stone
the creatures who inhabit this planet are not of a very high order mentally
he passed the bolla to popham and popham handed it to markham
it was presently returned to me and i packed it away as before
the professor then asked me for an account of what had happened during my flight toward baigol with the exchequer
gilhooly was not able to help me much in the recital as the most important part of our adventures was a perfect blank to him
i did not try to conceal anything from quinn
i painted my designs on the kings money as black as they really were and he smiled as he listened
when did mr gilhooly lay hands on the bolla
quinn asked
how do you know that he did
i returned am very sure that he did was the quiet reply
thereupon i told the professor how i had thrown the stone from the heap of gold and gilhooly had picked it up his reason returning shortly afterward
quinn wagged his head sagely and mumbled something i could not understand but which had to do with the ridiculous pretensions of the bolla
i feared then for the mind of this great and good man
was he breaking under the tremendous responsibility incurred by removing the plutocrats from earth
a chill of apprehension shot to my heart
i was about to say something of a soothing nature to my patronfor i certainly looked upon him as suchwhen olox and his gaddbaizets appeared
key seven of the high chiefs wordbox titillated with relief the instant the officer got his eye on gilhooly
the exuberance faded into a note of foreboding and the foreboding into the words where is the kings treasure house
if that has not been recovered calamity threatens our expedition to the planet terra
the treasure house has been broken and wrecked replied the professor but my friends mr gilhooly and mr munn are returning the gold to his majesty in their coats
why should mr gilhooly steal the gold and then help to return it came incredulously from olox
is it simply a vagary of his unbalanced mind am pleased to say chief olox that his mind is no longer unbalanced returned the professor warning me to silence with a look as i was about to operate my talking machine
mr gilhooly is now as sane as you or olox looked worried declare said he donot know how the president and board of directors of the interplanetary will regard this unexpected occurrence
they should feel overjoyed at the unclouding of so bright a mind as mr but what if it interferes with the traffic of the road
they have been running limited trains on a schedule heretofore beyond their wildest dreams
his majesty farmed out the concession to the management of the road for ninetynine years on a cash basis
if the traction power proves unavailable a demand will be made on the king for a return of the moneyand just now any depletion of the imperial coffers might prove fatal to the projected expedition
it was just as well that the exmagnates could not comprehend what was going on between the wordboxes
the utilitarian views of the king as exemplified in case would have jarred somewhat on their conceit and selfesteem
i noticed that a gleam of hope crossed face when olox spoke of a possible failure of the kings plan of conquest through lack of the sinews of war
but the hope died away almost instantly when quinn reflected as i did that the monarch was as unscrupulous as he was resourceful
no further conversation was indulged in
the royal troops executed an about face and returned to the capital convoying our reunited party of aliens
as we drew up in the square the two glittering soldiers appeared in the turrets and sounded a call that drew the king to the balcony
his majesty listened to the report of olox with a beaming face but his smiles fled when he learned how the traction interests of the realm were threatened by returning sanity
while this momentous question was still up for debate meigs plucked at the professors sleeve
tell the king professor said he his eyes downcast that i see the error of my way and frankly acknowledge it
if i am ever so fortunate as to get back to earth i shall be a reformer
please ask the king when i can have my clothes
and this was meigs
had the heavens fallen i could not have been more astounded
tell him the same for me spoke hannibal markham
make it even stronger if you will
i have not been starved into should have withstood such a siege to the deathbut the change has been wrought here
he struck a hand against his heart
and ask him professor added markham plaintively to have my wants supplied immediately from the palace kitchens
allow me to join my honorable friends in this free announcement of a change of heart chimed in augustus popham
look at my hands
he held his hands out to us and we found them calloused and scarred canot go back to those mole burrows he supplemented
professor quinn showed no signs of amazement
after grasping the palm of each exmagnate he fairly electrified his wordbox with the supplications of the exiles
are these acknowledgments freely made and do they come from contrite hearts said the king or do they merely cloak a desire to escape further privation at the expense of truth
the professor indignantly repelled the insinuation
when he had finished his vigorous remarks i stepped to the front and made a complete confession of my designs on the bolla and the imperial exchequer
quinn tried to stop me but i would suffer no interference
are you aware said the king gravely that lse majest felony and half a dozen other capital crimes are mixed up in your confession
am i less courageous than an extrust magnate cried i warmly
their confessions free them from servitude and the inconveniences of hunger and lack of raiment responded the king yours condemns you to a blast of zet that will consume and dissipate your body as though it had never been
professor quinn groaned and turned away with one hand over his eyes
my affection reached out for the good man then as it had never done before
bring on the indexograph olox commanded the king
we will see how much of truth or falsehood it registers in the cases of these gentlemen
the indexograph was brought and test was made of all of us except the professor
the ideographs must have registered mightily in our favor for the king seemed more than convinced of our sincerity
restore to the clothing trust man the apparel that is rightfully his ordered his majesty allow the gentleman who would monopolize food to partake of a sufficient supply to satisfy his hunger free the person who has been delving for my black blocks from further dutyand incidentally confiscate the funds paid into the royal treasury for his services as well as for the services of the traction powerfor mr sanity precludes his further use on the interplanetary
be happy gentlemen
i feel that i must do some worthy deeds to commemorate this the day that witnesses our departure for the subjugation of terra
quinn was rent with conflicting emotions as was plainly apparent
he was glad the explutocrats had fallen into royal favor he was sorry to have me yet under that ban and he was greatly wrought up to learn that the king meditated such an early start on his interstellar campaign
what of mr munn your highness he inquired
oh yes returned the king was forgetting him
olox let him be decorated with the order of the open hand and see that he is inducted on the morrow into the office of executionergeneral
we need an executioner to fill the place of the late incumbent and i should have to look far before i found so conscientious a person as mr munn
leave orders with a subordinate olox
neither you nor i will be here to attend the ceremony
my royal will shall be conveyed to the regent
and now added the king as he rose from his seat while the treasurer counts the kyicks and takes care of the bolla olox you and i will proceed to the metal house guarded by the gaddbaizets and accompanied by our alien friends
some preparations were necessary before a start for the car could be made and while these were going forward meigs and markham were led away to receive the attention their condition demanded
in an hour we were on the road
meigs and markham were in jubilant mood popham was optimistic but subdued gilhooly was silent and thoughtful and i was inclined to look at the future with reckless indifference
but professor quinn was bowed under a grievous load
if this madcap monarch carried out his scheme of conquest quinn felt that on him alone would rest the responsibility am making my plans mr munn he whispered hoarsely to me as we proceeded on our journey to the car
if the kings expedition gets away i shall have to accompany it and i shall take care that neither he nor his gaddbaizets ever reach our native planet
but suppose we can outwit the king in some way i returned and escape in the car leaving him and his subjects behind
you and our other friends may go if we can possibly manage it said quinn but i have made up my mind to stay here
i stopped short and stared at him
surely you canot mean that
i exclaimed do mean it he said firmly
for the good of terra these creatures of njambai must be watched
we have only a surface knowledge of them and their resources
what if they should bring forward other means of spanning space besides our car you see the professor went on passionately that my misguided enthusiasm painted the wonders of earth in such glowing colors that king gaddbai will strain every effort to gratify his cupidity and lust for conquest
i must remain here to combat him and hold him in check
sir said i in trepidation think you take fright too easily
once we leave njambai in the car it will be impossible for any of the baigadds to follow us
you overestimate their possible resources
whatever is possible cannot be overestimated
it may chance that i alone shall stand between this resolute monarch and the welfare and happiness of terra
to desert my post would be cowardice
do not seek to argue with me for i made up my mind to this last night
the reckless indifference with which i had fared forth from the city gave place to deep sorrow
professor quinn observed this and continued do not exercise yourself over my fate mr munn
i removed four rabid enemies of the people from our planet and i give back to it four eminent reformers
my end has been accomplished beyond my fondest dreams if this is brought to pass
and then too there is a work that i can do here even if my dire imaginings prove unfounded
i can after i know these mercurials better lead them perhaps to a higher round in the ladder of civilization
with the pattern of our earthly institutions before my eyes i can choose the good eliminate the evil and build a fabric here that will be a glory to whatever resources the orb may possess
is it not a fair destiny for one who was laughed out of the astronomical society because he dared to have convictions as i did
it is a destiny professor said which i intend to share with you
you remain here and so do possibly you may become prime minister i will be executionergeneral
between us we will have control of the situation
that is not to be thought of answered the professor hastily
if it is possible for the exiles to escape in the car you must accompany them as the one coolheaded resourceful man capable of guiding the car to its destination
i shall instruct you carefully and fully
and besides he added as i was about to demur you are a changed man mr munn
there is work for you on the home planet for your native worth is to retrieve itself on the very scene of your unworthy exploits
i trust you follow me
pardon me if i hurt your feelings by being too frank
he had wittingly or unwittingly touched the vital chord which made me eager to regain the world i knew and loved
to stand fair in the sight of men who had known me at my worst was now my one consuming desire
is this your wish professor quinn
i asked huskily
it is mr munn
then i shall follow your instructions to the letter
do so he said with one of his rare smiles
and if our dear desires compass fulfillment open this packet when you have left njambai and are in the great void
it will be my last word to you and your fellow voyagers in space
he handed a sealed packet to me and i placed it carefully in my breast pocket
then a handclasp followed in which heart went out to heart as it rarely does between man and man
look mr munn exclaimed the professor releasing my palm
we have reached the car
we had come to a point in the underworld which the reflected rays of the sun reached but dimly
there would have been semigloom but for an unreflected glow that fell upon us from above
the car as has been brought out in the course of this narrative had been blown into the crater of a dead volcano
this crater may be likened to a deep basin pierced with a huge hole at the bottom
through the hole fell daylight from the outer shell bathing the car in a soft radiance
the projectileshaped house was standing upright and appeared to have suffered no injury by its fall
professor quinn had already explained to me how this might be possible
the screens of the antigravity cubes had been left open by five decrees
the energy of the cubes lightened the house to an extent that made it offer less than normal resistance to the tempest and it also buoyed it to withstand the shock of a tumble from the upper crust of the sphere
how like an old friend that car looked
my heart labored at the mere sight of it
it was to be our bridge through space if so we could contrive although it might easily fall out to prove a bridge for the king and the gaddbaizets to the earths undoing
after we had halted at the base of the car the king approached the professor
your metal house is intact and uninjured said his majesty save for the door that gives admittance to it
it was necessary to burn out the lock with a draft of zet before the door could be opened
the telescope and the tub of white pigment have both been replaced and you will i think find all your goods and chattels intact
how long before we can start
let me first understand your arrangements your majesty the professor answered
are you or olox to guide the car through space to your intended destination
you are to do that
neither i nor olox could manage the car i fear
then i am to accompany you have so decided
what of my friends
they are to be left here
you need not worry about them however as they will be well cared for
i have already given proof of my interest in them
before i can give you an answer as to when it will be well to start quinn remarked after a little thought shall have to go into the car and make some calculations
we will go in with you returned the king should prefer to take only mr munn with me sir
the king became suspicious and olox got the royal ear and said something in an undertone on his wordbox
you and munn may go in the king said when olox had finished but we shall keep the rest of your friends with us while you are making your calculations
very well
the professor and i thereupon entered the car watched with some apprehension by meigs and the rest
possibly they feared that we were about to desert them if so the look the professor gave them must have set their fears at rest
a survey of the interior of the car showed everything to be exactly as we had left it
the door at the top of the iron stairway had been forced precisely as the other at the outside entrance had been but this was a matter of small importance
the oxygen tank was intact and the professor showed me how to manipulate the lever that regulated the supply necessary for the car there was still plenty of water of good quality in the reservoir and of food such as we were accustomed to there was an abundance
everything appeared to be in proper order and just as it should be
we are very fortunate mr munn said quinn seating himself on a box brought you in here with me less to have your help in examining the interior of the car than to seize an opportunity for giving you a few directions which you will find of use
when we left earth we started at an hour which gave us a course that angled sunward when you leave njambai however you must do so at an hour when this part of the planet is turned away from the sun and as far away as possible
that will cause the car to be hurled toward the outer edge of the solar system and in the direction of the earths orbit wish i could inform you as to the exact position the earth will be in when you cross its orbit but the kings mad project was sprung so suddenly and he has acted upon his plan so quickly that i have had no time for calculations in that respect
your business however will be to overhaul the earth
the telescope will inform you of the planets position and by properly regulating the screens of the cubes you can hang in the orbit of terra until it reaches you then once within its influence shut off the energy of the cubes and suffer the car to fall to its surface
do i make myself plain
entirely so professor i replied
you understand the dangers of landing
all you can do is to experiment with the atmosphere while you are falling exactly as we did when landing here
on your quickness and discretion will depend the lives of yourself and the others who will be with you
it is a great responsibility sir said but you can depend upon me to do my utmost to avoid a disaster
he pressed my hand to assure me of his confidence
midnight tonight will be the hour to start
the crater of the volcano will then be at its farthest from the sun
i shall so inform the king when we leave the car
have you thought of any plan whereby we may outwit his majesty
i inquired have thought of it
prior to the moment of embarking i shall request his majesty to allow you and the rest of our friends to come aboard while i detain him and his followers outside for a few final instructions
the king will suspect nothing for he will not imagine that i would allow you to escape and leave me behind shudder to think of that part of it i murmured
will you not reconsider your determination professor
no mr munn
on that point i am adamant
the instant you enter the car hurry aloft and set loose the oxygen
i will drop this bit of rope near the door when we leave and you will have to make use of it to tie the door securely shut on the inside
mind what i tell youdo not pull the lever until the door is securely closed will remember
the car is exactly under the crater opening and you will have a clear path aloft
therefore i would advise that you throw the lever to ninety the instant the door is fastened
i nodded think that is all
your work is simple enough for in order to reach terra you have only to reduce or expand the energy of the antigravity cubes
we will now go below and rejoin the king
just a few minutes more professor i begged
this may be our last opportunity for a private talk and there is something i wish to tell you
he turned back from the top of the iron stairway
go ahead mr munn said he
all of us whom you brought to njambai i proceeded are changed men
to you alone we owe this and i wish to go on record here and now for giving you credit
i see my past as i thought i never should see it and i realize how i have wasted a large part of my life
i shall prove a worthy citizen if we succeed in getting back to earth and it is you who have brought about my reformation
a glow came to the professors face
he held up one hand protestingly
it is the truth i insisted
you have argued with me constantly ever since we were thrown together and it was while on the road to baigol that the truth of your arguments suddenly came home to me
i stretched out my hand but he held back
you are too shrewd a man mr munn said he kindly to be so deceived
there have been times when your artlessness made me wonder but you have never aroused my wonder quite so much as you have now
why is that
i asked puzzled
answer me this mr munn he went on
how did it chance that mr gilhooly so suddenly recovered his reason
he lost his wits suddenly and crazed people have been known to regain their sanity as quickly as they lost it
it must have been so in case
indeed he said smiling
and was it merely a coincidence that you found your conscience and gilhooly his reason at the same time
merely a coincidence i replied
he laughed and it was his first happy laugh since king gaddbai had announced his coming campaign in the direction of terra
let us go further he went on
what caused markham popham and meigs to change their points of view so miraculously
was it the coal mines the lack of food and the need of decent clothing
all that merely paved the way i averred
your arguments did the rest
you are blind mr munn
it was not the sufferings our friends endured nor my arguments
then what was it
i demanded
the bolla
i recoiled staring blankly at the kindly face before me let me part from you professor quinn i whispered hoarsely feeling that i have left behind a man of unsound mind
if i thought that i believe i should remain here with you at any cost
unsound mind he returned
my dear munn
my brain was never clearer nor my reasoning more sound than at the present moment
you found the bolla
the moment you picked it up every unworthy thought vanished from your mind and you became morally the man you ought to be
you did not understand the cause of your salvation and you hurled the stone from you
gilhooly picked it up
what happened then
did he not recover his senses and a true outlook upon life at one and the same time
yet as if this were not enough to prove a clear case for the bolla note the change in popham markham and meigs when i asked them to examine the stone
all this sir should prove my contention beyond all peradventure
i am filled with wonder because you have gone so far afield in trying to explain what has occurred
the notion amazed and in a measure disappointed me
a black stone had turned me from my evil coursea mere bit of insensate matter about which clustered the traditions and superstitious veneration of all njambians
my regeneration had come from without and not from within and if there was no credit for the professor in my awakening then there was still less for myself
not the operations of my own mind urged and guided by the friendly counsels of the professor but a stone which i had picked up to cast away had worked my transformation
the fact still remained and would always remain but it was in no way flattering to me
what was going on in my mind must have been divined by the professor for he stepped close and took the hand which he had a moment before refused
the methods of fate are inexplicable to us mortals mr munn said he but what matters it how a thing is brought to pass so long as it really happens
and why should we concern ourselves with a failure to understand the underlying cause
great is the bolla my friend even though its powers pass our comprehension
i shall make it a point to see that it is returned to king golbai during my probation here
to accomplish that and at the same time keep watchful eyes on king gaddbai will not let time hang heavy on my hands
and you will not reconsider he knew what i was about to say pressed my hand restrainingly and got up from his seat
presently he removed a few feet of rope from a bale and took a last long look around him
what his thoughts were i will not even hazard a guess
cutting loose from every tie that held him to earth i knew very well what my feelings would have been under the circumstances
but i have already stated that the professor was queer in his outlook upon life and in his grasp of ways and means so my pen hesitates to attempt a description of his emotions at this critical moment
when we emerged from the steel shell the king and his retainers crowded close to hear what my companion had to say
his majesty was greatly disappointed on learning that the start was not to be made until some hours had passed but he smothered his impatience and busied himself with a communication to the regent giving the exact hour the expedition intended to take its departure
the historian chosen to accompany the monarch and put into imperishable ideographs the history he was to make transcribed the kings message and it was dispatched by courier to the capital
following this business his majesty entertained us with a review of the gaddbaizets selected by olox for the expedition
the diminutive soldiers were welldrilled wellequipped and presented a dazzling spectacle in their gilt war paint and yellow kirtles
they were truly the flower of the country
each carried a pair of zetbais filled to the white tip with a special supply of zet
quinn now that his mind was made up to defeat the king and to remain on njambia displayed much interest in the maneuvres even going so far as to applaud them
stores of prepared food had been collected in bales which were piled in a heap beside the car ready for loading
one bale was opened toward the close of day and we used its contents for our supper rations
night fell and the professor asked me to enter the car and light the lamp on the table
i did so and in the glow that came through the car windows we who were not gifted with the owlsight of the njambaians were able to see a little of what went on around us
as the night advanced and king gaddbai evinced his impatience and excitement by walking back and forth in front of his picked guard strains of the national anthem were borne to us from a distance
louder and louder swelled the tones of the wordboxes and at last the regent arrived accompanied by a host from the town
they were there to give their monarch a rousing sendoff and i smiled a little as i thought of the disappointment that was likely to overtake them
while felicitations were being exchanged between the king and his people professor quinn asked me to consult my watch
i found that we were within fifteen minutes of midnight
my timepiece was not strictly accurate inasmuch as in the exciting events of the morning i had neglected my usual custom of setting the hand three minutes back
however the indicated time was close enough for all practical purposes
into the car with you mr munn said the professor as calmly as though his command were not going to separate him from his kind for all eternity
i would have taken his hand had he not observed the movement and said quickly
be careful
we must not let these people suspect by a word or gesture the sort of coup we are planning
take the others with will speak to the king and cover your movements as i have already outlined
those were professor last words to me
my final glimpse of him showed me his resolute face and slender form drifting away into the gloom in the direction of king gaddbai
i felt as though i must run after him and drag him into the car whether he would or no
how i succeeded in fighting down the mad impulse has ever since been a mystery to me but i did and a word to popham meigs markham and gilhooly who had already been informed that they were to expect a startling dnouement brought them after me into the steel structure
i heard olox give a loud command for us to turn back but his wordbox was suddenly quieted and i presumed that the professor had already gone far enough with his part of the ruse to lull any suspicions that had arisen
rope that steel door on the inside gilhooly
i cried as i bounded up the iron stairs
gilhooly did not know what had been planned but leaped instantly to the task
with a quick pull of the lever i opened the oxygen tank and dashed below once more
something had gone wrong did not know what and do not know to this day
the mysterious violet fire which accompanied a discharge of the zetbais was rolling all around the steel wall that hemmed us in and a perfect tumult of shrieks and cries came frantically to our cars
violent hands were laid on the door pushing it inward against the rope made fast by gilhooly
gilhooly and the others hurled themselves at the portal and flung it back holding it so by main strength be killed shouted meigs
no i yelled and jumped to the switch board
the next instant the switch was thrown and the billows of fire faded from the car windows as if by magic
we were saved
again had we plunged into space and behind usliving or dead i knew notwe had left professor quinn
sinking down on my knees i buried my face in my hands
i have heard some one say that life is only a dream and that when we awaken in the other country we shall find it so
far be it from me to dispute this or affirm it yet i know of my own experience that our waking moments furnish events that seem as illusory as the stuff that dreams are made of
of all our strange adventures the flight from njambai has been the one that i recall with most vividness and at the same time as seeming the most unreal
the tension of my nerves at the moment may account for this
as i stated somewhere close to the beginning of this narrative what i set out to write was a description of the planet mercury in so far as my limited abilities for observation enabled me to gather knowledge
in looking back over my manuscript i find i have made it more of an adventurous tale than i intended
now when near the close i can hold more closely to my text and deal only generally with our return trip to terra
it is needless to dwell upon the way we missed and mourned the professor
at every turn some want developed which he could easily have satisfied had he been with us
however his wisdom had started us correctly and we had perforce to make shift and get along without him as best we could
as captain of the car the weight of a great responsibility rested on me
i was almost constantly at the telescope and i kept whom i had the most confidenceabout as constantly at the switch board
we were menaced by frequent dangers during the trip our course being literally strewn with meteoroids which it required much deft maneuvring to evade but we came safely out of these perils and as if to compensate us for them we formed a most happy juncture with the orbit at a time when that planet was approaching and nearly upon us
with gilhooly at the lever and myself at the telescope we accomplished a very successful landing
so evenly balanced did the car hang between the cubes and the drawing power of gravity that the last thousand feet of our descent was merely a floating earthward and we alighted with so slight a shock that none of us experienced a particle of inconvenience
the land that claimed us was a deserted island in where we remained for two weeks living off our food supply and keeping a sharp lookout for a sail
we had not been more than a day on the island before i remembered the document professor quinn had given me
i had been directed to open it while on our way through the great void but i had been so burdened with responsibilities during that time that i had not once thought of the packet
with my four companions as auditors i read aloud one of the papers inclosed in the packet which was addressed to all of us jointly
when you read this i trust that the plans of myself and mr munn will have proved so far successful that an impassable gulf will stretch between you and the undersignedand i write this out of a desire to have you speeding on your return to our native planet not because i would willingly separate myself from you were circumstances here different from what we have found them
as long as i live i shall stand between king gaddbai and any monstrous plan he may form and attempt to carry out looking to the subjugating of the world we know and love so well
i am convinced that the king has resources of which we know nothing and it shall be my aim to fathom the resources of njambai and assist in their development along other and more peaceable lines
this is to be my work and i enter upon it with a tranquil soul
no doubt i took what you gentlemen may think was an unwarranted liberty in luring four of your number to my castle and casting it adrift in the unknown
as for myself i believe i had ample warrant for doing what i did i will not dwell on that motive as it is already familiar to you
the experience each of you has had on njambai has been most salutary
you have undergone a change of heart and reform has wrought its great work
had i not been assured of this none of you would ever have left this sphere for that other one which has been the cradle of your pet schemes in speculation
you are not the same men you were
as reformers you will do your share to preserve our noble country from dire calamities that threaten it
that is your mission and see to it that you fail not in its performance
it is my prayerful hope that you will reach your destination in safety and with mr munn at the helm i am prone to think that this result will be achieved
if a civilized country claims you immediately upon landing it is my wish that you give full power to the antigravity cubes and send the car into space it is my wish that none of you give a record of his experiences to the papers either wholly or in part until five years have passed and then that this duty devolve upon mr munn and it is my final wish that mr munn accept the enclosed deed to my harlem lot and the enclosed check making payable to him all the funds i have in bank
i would have him return to the other four of you an equivalent for the funds and valuables stolen the night we left earth in the car
my second wish as to the revelations you gentlemen could make is born of a desire to save the earth dwellers any unnecessary fear on the score of king gaddbai and his undertakings
if he has not invaded terra with his terrifying zetbais by the time five years have elapsed it is my conviction that the danger will be done away with forever
gentlemen adieu
as you read this i give you hail from njambai
a fortnight after the reading of the above document we sighted a sail on the horizon and by means of a rope reaching from the switch board through a window the lever was pulled and professor castle shot into the clouds and vanished for all time
three hours later we were picked up by a whale boat conveyed to the tramp steamer mollie and in a month sailed through the golden gate into san francisco harbor
the five years have passed and i have set my hand to the foregoing
gilhooly and meigs have crossed to the great majority but the strenuous work they did in the interests of the people is an imperishable monument to their memory
popham and markham are still laboring for the good of the cause
the return to home and friends of these four long given up for dead caused a sensation throughout the country
true to the expressed wish of professor quinn none of them has breathed a whisper of the marvelous things he saw or of the weird experiences that fell to his lot while journeying to and from njambai and while sojourning upon that planet
so far as i am concerned my life since my return to earth has been as spotless as a thorough reformation could make it
as far as i could i have reimbursed those from whom i took what was not rightfully mine i have pleaded the cause of the poor man and helped him liberally out of the generous fortune bestowed upon me by professor quinn and i intend to pursue this line of action until the last day of my life
could a reformed burglar have a more suitable occupation
