an enigma
mr benson of benson grimes attorneys was a small man physically with towcolored hair and eyebrows and two mismatched eyes one brown and the other gray
his eyes fenced gro tesquely with mine as i entered his private office and stood at attention
i had never met the man before and the curi osity of two strangers who suddenly find that they have business together was ours
on my part the curiosity was heightened by an utter lack of knowledge concerning the business
well
mr benson wriggling in the chair before his desk rapped out the word with the insistent em phasis of a busy man with no time for trifles
my name is robert lorry mr benson said ah
he whirled quite around in his pivot chair at that and vouchsafed me his full atten tion
the brown eye and the gray traveled over my seedy garments and unshaven face
i wondered if he knew i had but two fivecent pieces in my pocket
sit down mr lorry said he indicating a chair
has this business of ours anything to do with my uncle rufus
i inquired taking the chair
whether the business has anything to do with relatives of yours or not i donot know he re sponded
my part is extremely simple mr lorry consisting merely of making sure you are the man wanted delivering a document and a small sum of money and giving you some instruc tions orally
i have no knowledge of the whys and wherefores and i cannot say that they greatly interest me
he got up from his seat and went to a small safe at one side of the room
taking a long manilla envelope from the safe he returned to his desk drew a sheet from the envelope and spread it out before him
a a ter to four it will be necessary mr lorry he resumed leaning back in his chair for you to submit to a number of questions decidedly personal in na ture
this is by way of establishing your iden tity
i nodded
there was much of my past that i would have been glad to undo but nothing that i was ashamed of
mr benson might probe as deep as he liked
my principal concern was for the elaborate precautions he was taking to make sure of my identity
what was in the wind
mr benson raised his eyes from the sheet in front of him
how old are you mr lorry he asked
the lawyer dropped his eyes to the paper picked up a leadpencil and checked off my an where were you born
in great barrington massachusetts
another move with the pencil
it was plain that the examination was going forward cate gorically
your fathers given name
i i a art to four hiram
your mothers maiden name
anne mayhew
are your parents living or dead
they died when i was five years old
mr benson checked twice
evidently my re sponse had covered two questions
where did you live and with whom after the death of your parents
in great barrington with my uncle rufus lorry
my parents left a small estate and uncle rufus was made guardian and trustee he lifted a hand restrainingly
let us stick to the catechism said mr ben son it is not necessary to go beyond what i have here
when did you leave great barring ton mr lorry
eight years ago where have you been since
it would take some time to tell you that sir i answered have been knocking about the world and that is the reply i wanted interrupted mr benson with more work of the pencil
any other relatives besides your uncle rufus
a a ter to four have another uncle jeremiah lorry who is a missionary in any one else cousin on my mothers side of the house
no one else
the cousins name
arthur mayhew
what is arthur business
he was a soldier in the united states army when i heard of him last
mr benson penciled an on the sheet refolded it and laid it aside
your answers are satisfactory said he and i am now to proceed on the supposition that you are the robert lorry wanted
he drew from the envelope a small packet of paper money
please count it he went on handing the money to me
one hundred and fifty dollars i observed after thumbing the bills a receipt
please sign it
he drew out a leaf at the side of his desk laid a typewritten slip upon it and handed me an a arter to four inked pen
my fingers shook a little as i signed my name
the typewriting began received of benson grimes per benson
there was no other cue to the donor of the money and i was quite naturally mystified should like to know who gives me this i remarked am working at the instigation of another attorney mr lorry and am as much in the dark as yourself
two hundred and fifty dollars was sent to me
my fee is fifty dollars and it cost fifty dollars to have a private detective hunt you up at that twelfth street boardinghouse
i was told merely that you were in chicago and smiled rather a large place in which to locate a stranger
the re mainder of the amount sent to me is now in your hands
he folded the receipt and laid it with the other document
that money is to be used for a purpose mr lorry he added
what purpose
i inquired
you are to proceed to san francisco timing yourself to arrive in that city on the twentyfifth of april
when there go to the palace hotel
three others will be there waiting for you
a a to four am to make myself known to them
yes
i was properly at sea with all this you may be sure
yet my life had been one which enabled me to adapt myself to the circumstances with comparative ease
taking a pencil and notebook from my pocket i asked for the names of those i to meet do not know the names of the three per sons was the lawyers astounding answer
they will be at the palace hotel san fran cisco on the twentyfifth and will be expecting you take it then that they know my name and will make themselves known to me
mr benson shook his head
they do not know your name he proceeded and will make themselves known to you by ques tion and answer
you may do the questioning or the others may do it
the question is this what time is it
the answer a quarter to four
you may give the challenge or receive it and the response must be the one stated
this looks like a lot of claptrap possibly lead ing nowhere
i exclaimed
a a to our possibly returned mr benson
is it a hoax
rather an expensive one if it is donot you think
you will take drew a small sealed envelope from the larger one and handed it to san francisco with you
there was no address on the envelope no in formation of any kind
unless instructed to the contrary said mr benson you will open that envelope at a private conference of the four after all of you have been identified
this looked to me like a lot of cumbrous ma chinery for evolving an infinitesimal result
i said as much in a tone of pronounced depreca tion
the lawyers mismatched eyes surveyed me with weary impatience have done my part mr lorry he an nounced and you will either do yours or leave it undone as you see fit
good morning
thereupon i left the room the money in my pocket the sealed envelope in the breast of my coat and my mind in a chaos of speculation as fruitless as it was exasperating
zooking backward
have you ever observed how hard luck when it once deals you a telling blow follows it up with another and another
you are fortunate indeed if this observation is not born of personal experi 11ce
misfortune getting past your guard with a blow that dazes and bewilders proceeds forth with to take advantage of your sorry condition and to smite you hip and thigh
thus had the world gone with me up to the very hour i had received that letter summoning me to the office of benson grimes
just before the letter came into my hands so grievously had i been worsted by the blows of circumstance that i had begun to wonder if i were not down and out
adversity is a rough road
where it branches from the smooth and sunny thoroughfare of suc cess one can usually look back and see a sign board that was wrongly interpreted
for me uncle rufus stood at the parting of a a to four the ways
if he had been a little less inflexible if he had concerned himself a little more with my natural bent and had not sought to drive me into a vocation for which i was manifestly unfitted perhaps i should not have awakened that bright spring morning in a humble hall bedroom with certain arrearages of board to meet and with only ten cents in my pockets
my estatewhich with myself had been left to the care of uncle small amount ing to about five thousand dollars
yet if the world gives atlas as much trouble as that money gave uncle rufus then i am sorry for atlas
uncle rufus wanted me to become a minister
as i had absolutely no inclination that way he deferred to the wanderlust that had taken hold of me from my infancy and trimmed his desires to the more modest specifications of a missionary
he thought that by wandering in heathen parts i could please myself and that by evangel ising the heathen i could please him
but still his pattern was too large for his cloth
the crusoe spirit fastened upon me by virtue of a onesyllable edition which i sequestered about the time i discarded pinafores for short a a to four trousers
from mariner it was an easy stage to gil blas and only a couple of steps farther to the count of monte cristo and two years before the mast
my readingroom while i lived with uncle rufus was a corner of the haymow
in the house my puritanical straightlaced guardian had laid out a noble library with book of martyrs at the head for my especial benefit
one day uncle rufus commended the zeal i displayed in imbibing the martyrs only to look over my shoulder a little later and find jack harkaway snuggled among the leaves
from that moment our estrangement began growing through the years to an ultimate separation
i graduated from the high school at eighteen with an imagination that had won me the honor of class prophet
it was a gallant effort i re member carving out fame and fortune for nine young men and women and inasmuch as i left every one of them in power and prominence it was heartily applauded
i went home that night to find uncle rufus dallying with a bonfire
as i drew nearer i a a to four saw him poking the last vestige of my haymow collection of literature into the flames
we had words
at midnight i stole away from the house left great barrington and the dear old berkshires on the trucks of a passenger train and in three days had shipped as cabinboy on a tramp steamer bound for cape town
how is a soldier of fortune launched upon his career
in some such way as this i imagine providing the inclination to roam is strong enough to endure the hardships
on the way to africa i had sailoring cursed and hammered into me
no sooner was the tramp under the shadow of table mountain than i went overboard in the night and in due course reached bultfontein and the diamondfields
looking for bits of carbon in blue ground did not satisfy me and it was not long before i joined a party that raided the boers got old england in no end of trouble and incidentally put me in hospital for a month
when well enough i shipped on a yankee trader for the south seas from the portuguese settlements
it is needless to detail the eight years of knock ing about
soldiers of fortune usually find cen a a to four tral america in their itinerary so quite naturally it dropped into mine
had i been on the right side of the con troversy the man who would have made himself dictator of one of the states would have remembered me substantially
what a wealth of possibility is wrapped up in those words would have and should have
as it chanced i was on the wrong side of that central american argument
a handful of ragged fugitives got me into mexico in a ham mock swung between horses for i had been badly wounded
the fugitives left me to die in the hut of a peon and with the peon they left a big bag of silver dollars to pay for decent interment and to reward the peon for his trouble
all my life long i had been disappointing peo ple so i disappointed the peon and began to re cover
when he saw the bag of dollars slipping away from him my gracious host tried to finish the bullets work with a dirk
he found me with more fight at my disposal than he had imagined and i escaped with my dollars and my hosts burro ultimately reaching a a to four the city of mexico
still far from well a desire to get back into country took hold of me and i struck for the heart of it making the long railroad journey to chicago
i would settle down i fondly persuaded my self
i was twentysix and it was high time
eight years as a rolling stone had left me with moss enough to pay two weeks board in a humble south side boardinghouse
i awoke from my monte cristo dreams and even the hum bler fortunes of the irish con cregan failed to interest me
i would look for a place to work
i looked for a month walking to save car fare during the last two weeks of the time
my search was unsuccessful
i could not keep books i could not write short hand i was not scholarly enough for a private tutor and had no references for a position of trust
no one in chicago wanted a man of such shining abilities as i had developed
as a last resort i tried shovelwork in a sewer gang
my spirit chafed because of it but my landlady mrs pynchon was becoming garrulous on the subject of a fortnights bill due and un paid
a a ter to four the discovery that the wound in my side made shovelwork an impossibility was not particularly distressing
i drew my time at the end of an hour and with fifteen cents in my pocket walked from diversey street on the north side to twelfth street on the south
my interview with mrs pynchon when i got back to the boardinghouse was of a nature that i hesitate to describe
during my absence she had taken possession of my grip had examined it at her leisure and had found it to contain a shortbladed machete a brace of revolvers and a pair of puttees
mrs pynchon was wroth indeed and in the morning i must pay or go
she would keep the relics of my central american experiences and sell them for what she could get
i was thinking of all this as i lay in my bed that bright spring morning looking out through the dusty windowpanes
should or should i not write to uncle rufus for an accounting
it seemed to me that five thousand dollars properly invested for eight years should amount to quite a tidy sum
many a time before i had thought with longing of that money but senti a a to four mentfoolish if you willhad kept me from claiming it
my dream tenderly nursed for those eight years had been to return to great barrington possessed of untold thousands thus proving com placently that i had opened the oyster with my own good sword
to demand an accounting of uncle rufus was tacitly to acknowledge defeatto admit he was right when he said during our last bitter interview that i would go my un bridled course and come to want
for a man whose strong spirit pants for suc cess the acknowledgment of failure is galling
even at a time when my fortunes were at their lowest ebb i could not bring myself to it
yet i was beaten
lying there in that bed for whose hire mrs pynchon still stood on the credit side of my ledger i pondered the momentous question as to whether being down i was to be counted out
in the throes of my quandary a knock fell on the door
mrs pynchon i thought come to eject me
but it was not mrs pynchon
it was betty a a ter to the maid and betty wonder of wonders had a letter for me
that letter proved to be the brief document that carried me to the office of benson grimes attorneys the astonishing result of which call has already been chronicled
i have never been very long in reaching a de cision or in mapping out a policy for future en deavor
with money for immediate needs and traveling expenses it was not five minutes after i left the lawyers offices before i had made up my mind to see the matter through
thereupon i replenished my modest wardrobe with a new suit of clothes visited the barbers and went back to mrs with the air of a prodigal who has come into his own
nothing succeeds like success unless now and then it is something that has the appearance of success
mrs attitude veered with the favoring wind and her hostility melted away in smiles
the roll of bills which i drew from my pocket in canceling my obligation appeared to contain vastly more than it really did
while her eyes widened her morbid amiability increased
a a to she was curious of course
what woman would not have been in the circumstances
it required all my tact to parry her indirect ques tions without offending
there was an embarrassing moment when she returned my satchel but when i left she gave me a hearty handclasp and begged that i would not forget her house whenever i chanced to be in the city
forget her house
not whether in the city or out of it
the most discouraging period of my life had been passed in that thirdclass board ingplace on twelfth street
that evening i started westward in a tourist sleeper equipped with a sealed envelope and a horological countersign more than halfcon vinced that i was wanted for some filibustering expedition
the time o day
the morning of april twentyfifth found me in the palace hotel in the city of the golden gate
to particularize further the beginning of that eventful day found me in the great ro tunda with a weathereye out for swashbucklers of the filibustering type
reflection during that long crosscountry jour ney had still further convinced me as to the de sign back of my interview with mr benson
the law has a heavy hand for filibusters outfitting from a peaceable port hence the mystery that pointed my course and shrouded my movements
one detail alone marred the theory i had evolved
sailors lodginghouses on the front should have been the scene of our questionable coming together and not that magnificent hos telry
big broadshouldered swag gerers with a thwartshiproll in their gait would surely be out of place in that splendid rotunda
a a ter to through the curling wreaths of my cigar i looked for such persons in vain
may i trouble you for the correct time sir
the words came like a thunderclap came from the depths of a sleepyhollow chair on my right
i hoisted up on one elbow for a sidewise stare
a stout gentleman with smooth face and iron gray hair silkhatted and prosperously dressed had launched the question
a morning paper lay across his knees and he was studying the open face of his watch quarter to four said searching the ques tioner with a keen look
the gentleman gave a startled gasp counter ing my glance with one of perplexity and alarm
still holding his watch in his hand he struggled to his feet and made his way to the desk
there he had some talk with the clerk both shooting covert looks in my direction
no doubt they considered me a fool or an idiot
it was late in the forenoon and could not by any possibility have been a quarter to four
my disgust was intense
the shallow absurd ity of my position exasperated and mortified me
red and perspiring i got out of my chair and a a to four went into the writingroom
seating myself in font of a desk i leaned on my elbows and began canvassing the difficulty that had so suddenly pre sented itself
i had word for it that there were three persons in that hotel who were as anxious to find me as i was to find them
but there were many guests and if i went from one to another inquiring the time of day it would not be long until my sanity was questioned and an officer called in
it was consoling to know that there were three others placed in a similar situation
the ridicu lous aspect of the affair caught me finally and i laughed to myself
instead of waiting for a challenge i would give one
a yard away sat a middleaged individual in a black silk skullcap he was writing in dustriously
pardon me said but could you tell me the time
the man in the skullcap paused looked toward me with a frown then jerked his head in the di rection of a clock that stared me in the face from a a to four an opposite wall
there was no need of words and none were spoken
there were three others in the writingroom
all had heard my query and if one of them had been in the plot certainly he would have signi fied it in some way and presently have come close enough to give me privately the correct answer
after a brief wait during which nothing hap pened i got up and went away
my disgust it is needless to say mounted as failures multiplied
if a quartet of filibusters were to come together in that hotel why had not the guiding mind speci fied green ribbons in coatlapels brickred neck ties or some other identification that would ap peal to the eye
for getting a man into trouble commend me a dozen times over to what he says rather than to what he sees
simple and inoffensive expedients it ap peared had been laid by
a silly question and a brainless answer i must abide by these if i were to follow the matter to its legitimate con clusion
leaning against a marble column in the ro tunda i watched the people coming and going across the mosaic floor lingering at the desl or a a to four filing away toward the elevator under convoy of the agile moneyseeker known as front
idlers in the sleepyhollow chairs again underwent my scrutiny
there was nothing at all promising in this ma terial
no one trod the mosaic floor with knees bent as though to meet the heave of a deck no one bearing the earmarks of a filibuster idled in the big chairs
nevertheless that was the palace hotel and the day was the twentyfifth of april
if i had been steered on a proper course there were three within sound of my voice who were as anxious to find me as i was to find them
if from my post at that marble column i had dared shout my query as to the time o day no doubt the three missing ones would have heard
but i lacked the hardihood for such initiative especially as a big clock with a dial like a full moon and hands and figures that could have been seen a mile hung in plain view from every part of the rotunda
from berating the extravagant machinery that was to lay me alongside the trio i had come to meet i fell to chafing at my helplessness
leav a arter to four ing the rotunda i went out to the sidewalk in front of the hotel
the fresh air i thought would clear my brain and settle my nerves
market street was crowded with people
a fruitgrowers convention was in progress and the walk in front of the palace seemed to be the rendezvous for a visiting delegation
i elbowed my way into the throng decided that it was no place for any one not a fruitgrower and started to elbow my way out of it again
a man collided with me and the next moment i pricked up my ears at the query what time is it neighbor
the voice was husky the man was bleareyed and his ensemble was little better than that of a hoodlum
by then i had learned to be cautious
bracing myself against the ebb and flow of the human current i drew my watch from my vest
while ostensibly studying the face of my time piece i would scrutinize the face of my inter locutor
if wariness could help me i would not place myself in a false position again
while i was debating whether i should give my inquirer the right time or the countersign he solved the ques a art to ur tion by seizing my watch and vanishing into the crowd
stop thief
i shouted and attempted pursuit
on account of the jam however a successful pursuit was impossible
after i had overturned half a dozen pedestrians and had been tossed back and forth like a waterlogged hulk in the current i gave up attempting to recover the watch and drew out of the press into the ladies entrance of the hotel
while i stood there panting and bewailing my loss a cab pushed up to the curb and a lady alighted
she was a stout lady beyond middle age and with a motherly face
she was neatly gowned in black and her bonnet proved her a widow in mourning
the cabby dismounted from his box and handed his passenger an oldfashioned carpetbag
the hotel attach who looked after the ladies en trance was nowhere to be seen and the stout lady surveyed the current of humanity between her and the hotel door with dismay
that was a busy day with the cabby and he hurriedly mounted his box and drove away leav ing his fare on the curb
i ceased deploring the a a to loss of my watch descended the pair of steps that led to the ladies entrance and pushed my way through the stream of fruitgrowers
do you wish to get into the hotel madam said halting at the stout ladys side
she lifted her motherly face to mine forlornly hopeful
if you please mister she answered a breath less catch in her voice
sakes alive what an awful crowd
i took her carpetbag and requested her to take my arm
presently we gained the pair of marble steps and mounted to the hotel door all right now maam i observed in a cheery tone returning the carpetbag much obliged to you said she grate fully been a long time since i was in a big town like this and that flustered with the noise and bustle i hardly know whether afoot or horseback
could me she faltered and a scared look crossed her face
if i can do anything more for you i said command me
what time is it
a a to four she gazed fixedly at me
about eleven oclock i returned wondering at her stare and her odd manner
disappointment ran through the lines of her face
thank you she said and turned away
then i had a most amazing thought
it might be a quarter to four i called after her
by then her back was toward me and she was halfthrough the door
the carpetbag dropped and she clutched at the ornate doorknob to sup port herself
another moment and i was beside her again you found the others she asked
not yet i answered
in an hour be in one of the parlors on the second floor
will you meet me there
certainly said am mrs sarah brackett she added hesi tatingly offering her hand
and i am robert lorry i answered taking the hand encouragingly
i picked up the carpetbag for her and she van a a ter to ished into the marble corridor
so here was one of my filibusters
i wanted to laugh at finding myself so far afield but was too deeply mystified to treat the matter lightly
what could i possibly have in common with that elderly lady
there was no use bombarding myself with mental questions
the more i speculated the farther i found myself at sea
passing through the ladies entrance i trav ersed the corridor crossed the receptionroom and ultimately gained the rotunda
there i hunted out an unoccupied chair threw myself in to it and continued my reflections
this initial success was followed quickly by another
while busy with my thoughts my eyes absently followed the people who were coming and going around me
a young man fixed my passive attention
he was slight of form with carroty hair buttermilk eyes and a wisp of down on his upper lip
his forehead and chin were of the retreating variety giving his face a birdlike contour in fact as he fluttered about the rotunda he reminded me of a nervous tomtit
a arter to our his narrow chest and thin legs were incased in garments of an ultrafashionable sort
he wore lightyellow gloves lightyellow spats and carried a rattan cane
the young man belonged to a class that had never appealed to me
yet curiosity pulled me out of my reflections as i watched him
beginning at one end of a row of loungers he would flutter to the other end of the row halt ing at every third man to bend over and say some thing
when he passed on the loungers would exchange looks and significant grins and a fore head would be tapped suggestively
the young man worked his way nearer to where i sat
presently he came close enough so i could hear what he was saying
he was asking the time of day going about the work with systematic thoroughness and with utter disregard for appearances
i got up stepped over to him and took him by the arm
my friend said have you found any one yet who told you that it was a quarter to four
found he gasped
by jove
he shifted the rattan from his right to his left hand and dropped the right hand on my arm
a a ter to four fancy he went on with a vacuous grin thought it might be a joke
as i gazed at him and thought of the elderly lady upstairs in the parlor i was not altogether certain that it was not still a joke
have you found the other two he whis pered explosively have found one of them i answered have worked my way through the rotunda this far he proceeded and suppose we keep on
you go to the right and go to the left so no i returned firmly before we were half done an officer would be called in and wed be car ried off to some institution for the feebleminded
what is your name my friend
chauncey vandeleur
and yours
robert lorry say lorry whats it all about
i havenot the least idea donot you know
neither have i responded dryly
come upstairs with me and introduce you to the third person of our distinguished quartet
but i say he demurred got to find the fourth
a a to four the three of us will discuss that point i went on
if this was really a joke i wanted to make sure of it and wash my hands of the entire matter
chauncey vandeleur followed me to the ele vator
when we reached the secondfloor parlor we found mrs sarah brackett in animated con versation with a young ladya slender hand some girl of twentytwo or twentythree
as vandeleur and i came close mrs brackett started up with a look of undisguised pleasure
mr lorry she exclaimed
let me make you acquainted with miss zelda anstruther
i just asked her what time it was and she told me here the elderly ladys voice sank to an awe some it was a quarter to four
the color mounted to miss cheeks as i gazed at her
by jove chirruped vandeleur
this is what i call luck donot you know
instantly i revised my opinion as to the whole affair being a joke
the beautiful miss an struther it may be was responsible for the re vision
an odd enterprise
this mysterious business had nothing to do with filibustering that was sure
a motherly old lady a fair slip of a girl a youth with a simian facial anglethese three were out of any picture that had a background of lawlessness on the high seas or in the southern americas
the thought came to me that we were a set of pinktea conspirators brought together perhaps to plan a missionary campaign on the mosquito coast
yet even so miss hazel eyes reconciled me to whatever the fates held in i presented vandeleur
mrs brackett eyed him indulgently and sympathetically miss an struther with curiosity and some small amount of tolerance
vandeleur and i seated ourselves
finding that we were alone in the parlor we at once went into executive session
we have been strangely brought together page a a to four said in pursuance of some design of whose nature i have not the slightest knowledge
can any of you enlighten me
silence followed the query
four pairs of eyes fenced anxiously and fell in disappointment havenot the least notion what its all about mr lorry spoke up mrs sarah brackett from emmetsburg ioway myself and came on here because a lawyer by the name of cart wright advised me to
mr cartwright couldnot tell me much
he just handed me two hundred dollars said i was to be at the palace hotel in san francisco on the twentyfifth and go around asking what time it was until i had found three who said it was a quarter to four
i havenot trav eled a great deal and i hate anything thats not free and aboveboard so i thought long and hard before i concluded to take the trip
mr cart wright said better come
he knew my hus band ezry and my boy tom and hes always been a good friend to me mr cartwright has
the wrinkled lips quivered and the faded blue eyes grew frankly tearful
miss anstruther drew her chair closer to mrs and took one of her hands in both her own
a a to four havenot got ezry no more and i havenot got tom continued mrs brackett leaning toward the girl just a poor old woman with neither chick nor child i can call my own and i havenot enough money to hardly keep me out of the coun ty house
that two hundred dollars looked like a small fortune to me and i hated to spend it on what might turn out a wildgoose chase to san francisco
but mr cartwright said come and kept saying it and i didnot make up my mind till the last minute here now and thank ful to know i didnot have much trouble asking that foolish question and getting the foolish an swers
i wonder if you all felt about it like i did miss anstruther pressed the wrinkled hand she was holding am sure i did mrs brackett said she had waited in this parlor all morning without courage to put the question
when you came and asked me the time i felt as though i was going to faint
she smiled a little and barely glanced in my direction
yet she went on see how easily our meeting has come about
you find me and mr lorry finds mr vandeleur and a a ter to brings him to us
you have come from iowa mrs brackett but i have come all the way from new york and i hadand still have for that matteras little confidence in the outcome as you had yourself
my experience was similar to yours too lawyer wrote and requested me to call upon him
he gave me two hundred dollars told me substantially what your lawyer told you and i was several days considering the matter
i am stenographer for a law firm in liberty hays
i laid the matter before mr and he advised me to follow the tip as he called it and see what it amounted to
if the business comes to nothing i am to return to new york and have my old place back
thereupon i gave my experiences which paral leled those of mrs brackett and miss an struther
then we three directed our glances at vandeleur
deucedly odd exclaimed the young man with a smirk at miss anstruther which caused that young lady to avert her eyes live right here in frisco donot you know and got a letter from a lawyer chap just like miss anstruther a arter to four and mr lorry
i called on him and was jolly well surprised when he handed me a wad of greenbacks and told me to call at the palace on the twentyfifth and go around asking different people what time it was
here we all are though and whats to be done
the buttermilk eyes fixed themselves on me shrewdly
did any of you receive a sealed envelope
i inquired
all of us had been wary it seems and had held the matter of the sealed envelope back wait ing for a cue to mention it
straightway four envelopes identically alike were brought into view
no doubt i proceeded these envelopes have an important bearing upon the case
my lawyer instructed me that the envelopes were to be opened when we four came together
mr cartwright said the same thing an nounced mrs brackett
and so did the lawyer i visited in new york averred miss anstruther
my instructions were different said vande leur
as soon as we found each other the law a a to four yer here said we were to call on him and he would tell us what to do with our envelopes
i reflected upon this point
it was the only de tail in which our legal advisers had differed
who is your lawyer mr vandeleur
i in terrogated
mr price of price green garnett
is his office far from here
not more than two blocks
would we be likely to find him in his office now call him up on the phone mr lorry and see if he is there
we soon found that mr price was in his of fice and would receive us so we left the hotel im mediately and called on him
the lawyer was a big florid man and met us with a grim smile
vandeleur introduced us and mr price offered us chairs and closed the door of his private room
you all have your envelopes he asked
we produced the envelopes
very good he went on keep them carefully and do not let them get out of your possession for a minute
if one were lost this whole proceeding would result in a fiasco
i cannot tell you what the business is a a to four because i do not know
naturally however i am conversant with a few details and i know that a matter of prime importance is for you to hold fast to your envelopes
i have it on the best authority that this will mean much to you perhaps a fortune fortune murmured mrs brackett start ing upright in her chair fortune echoed miss anstruther staring
by jove exclaimed vandeleur
i smiled skeptically
rather an odd way to distribute a fortune donot you think mr price said oh yes he answered but indirect methods may be necessary
you four are to charter a sea going vessel manned and provisioned for a long voyage
when you are three days out on a west erly course you will hold a private conference on the boat and open your envelopes
their contents will give you your destination and other needful instructions
charter a vessel
i cried startled
embark for a long voyage with only the contents of four unopened envelopes to warrant the undertaking
mr price waved his hand admit it is ask a a to four ing a good deal of four people brought together in the strange way that you have been he vouch safed
however it may be in my power to give you more confidence in the undertaking
he took a paper from a pigeonhole in his desk and slowly opened it
do any of you know a person named arthur mayhew he asked
he was my cousin i spoke up
archibald anstruther pursued the lawyer
my brother faltered miss anstruther
he was in the army andand disappeared
thomas brackett intoned the lawyer son murmured mrs brackett fumbling for her blackbordered handkerchief
he was a soldier too and killed in chiny
leastways he hasnot been heard of for moren a year andand given him up
eugene trent continued the lawyer
by jove cried vandeleur mine
an uncle of a fat lot i ever cared for him
if you charter a boat and put to sea said mr price the four i have mentioned will be your authority for so doing
you will know bet a a to four ter than i whether they would have any intent to deceive you or to cause you needless expense
mrs brackett and miss anstruther had their handkerchiefs to their eyes
vandeleur was ab sently rolling a cigarette
i sat in my chair with a bewildered brain
where is the money to come from for char tering the boat mr price
i inquired
you four will have to settle that question among you he responded
no funds have been deposited for that purpose havenot a penny came tremulously from mrs brackett but if i am to go somewhere and find my boy tom i will find a way
so will declared miss anstruther with fine determination if my brother is calling for me to come to him
uncle gene can go to ballyhack for all of me grumbled vandeleur havenot a cent to pay for a seavoyage anyhow
you said some thing about a fortune mr price
by jove thats a different proposition from going it blind to find uncle gene
there is a big reward in the business for all a a to four of you reassured the lawyer providing you follow it up
what are we to do
miss anstruther put the question and all eyes appeared to focus on me
we shall find a way said we will go back to the hotel for luncheon and discuss ways and means immediately afterward
you have nothing more to tell us mr price
not a thing except to say that i wish you all the good luck imaginable
i started out with the others but the lawyer called me back
when he and i were alone and with the door closed he took me by a button con fidentially
your original instructions contemplated the opening of the envelopes in the hotel here did they not mr lorry he queried
yes i answered took it upon myself to change that
van deleur i find has not a very good character
all this complicated machinery which you think so odd and uncalled for was ingeniously devised to keep one of you four from obtaining an advan tage over the other and using it unfairly
if the a a to four envelopes are opened at sea vandeleur if so dis posed can do nothing to backcap your plans
do you rise to that think so said there are two estimable ladies in your party if i am any judge of character and it will fall upon you mr lorry as the most able and re sourceful to safeguard the ladies interests
keep an eye on vandeleur thats all
you have nothing more to tell mepri vately
no
i wish on my soul that i knew more but i donot
do you know of any one who would care to advance money for chartering a ship receiving back twice over the amount invested
once more he smiled grimly do not he returned
it would be a pre carious investment this putting up expenses for a quartet of rainbowchasers
but you said never mind what i said
i read off to you certain names and those names impressed the four of you
you and your three companions know the persons named and that should give a a to four you confidence but it would hardly impress an outsider
with that he bid me a good day and i left his office
i had been sadly tangled on leaving the chamber of commerce building after my inter view with mr benson but that state of mind wasnot a circumstance to the one i carried with me on leaving mr price
an unexpected assault
this then was the condition of affairs to go forward in the strange business that had brought us to san francisco we must have moneyenough to charter a boat for a long cruise
our starchamber session in the parlor of the palace hotel immediately after luncheon de veloped the very important fact that vandeleur had no funds and no credit
from what mrs brackett had said indirectly i knew that she could be of no financial help and miss anstruther assured me tearfully that she was in like circum that placed the brunt of it at my door and sent my thoughts eastward to uncle rufus and to my patrimony that had been gathering bulk through the years
should i hazard my all on a lawyers word that my cousin arthur mayhew vouched for the enterprise
i had never seen arthur mayhew more than a art to once in my life
he had lived in the middle west whither my relatives on the spindle side had emigrated and a wellearned reputation for being wild had restrained uncle rufus from inviting him to great barrington
when i was seventeen however arthur dropped in on us without an invitation
he was two years my senior had beaten his way over a good part of the world and i liked him im mensely
but he was a good deal of a rake and uncle rufus packed him off before he had been with us a fortnight
the instinct of a soldier of fortune pushed me toward the risk
what were a few thousands compared with an adventure that promised ex citement and much gain
that would draw miss anstruther and myself into close companionship for several months
this latter consideration had a good deal of weight with me
from what little i had seen of the girl i liked her immensely
we were of course taking the word of mr price for everything
and mr price was not only as ignorant as ourselves of the object of the a a to four undertaking but his optimism would not carry him the length of taking stock in it
by some psychological turn mrs brackett and miss anstruther had formed the conviction that the formers son and the latters brother were to be found at the end of this weird coil
hence they were feverishly eager to embark and put to according to vandeleur eugene trent was skipper of the brigantine ga aelle
he was a shady mariner and although san francisco was his home port the gazelle had not been seen in the bay for three years
vandeleur would have tramped barefoot around the world to get any money uncle gene had left but he would not have walked around the block to discover whether uncle gene were alive or dead
before our afternoon conference came to an end i offered to charter and provision a small seagoing boat if one could be had on reasonable terms
i added however that it would possibly be a fortnight before i could get at my money and suggested that we remove to some respect able but less pretentious hotel where the charges a a ter to four would be more in keeping with our circum miss anstruther looked her gratitude and mrs brackett caught my hand and thanked me tremulously
there was a fortune to be gained said miss anstruther and my three companions would see that i was well repaid for the pre liminary outlay
miss anstruther also suggested that inasmuch as i was to finance the enterprise the entire man agement should be left in my hands
i should be their leader and they would trust every detail to me implicitly
mrs brackett heartily agreed to this but van deleur balked
i have an idea that he wanted to captain our undertaking himself
in proof of their confidence mrs brackett and miss anstruther offered me their envelopes for safekeeping
i demurred but they insisted
finally i yielded asking only that each write her name across the flap of the envelope before giv ing it to me
vandeleur watched this proceeding with frank disapproval
then of a sudden his attitude changed and he averred fulsomely that the ladies a a to four had done exactly the right thing
a man he as serted was better able to safeguard the important documents than a woman and if i could take care of three of the envelopes certainly he could take care of one of them
vandeleur stated further that he had some ac quaintance with seafarers of the barbary coast and could introduce me to just the skip per we wanted for our requirements
i was liking vandeleur less and less the more i saw of him
i thanked him a bit curtly for his offer averring that i had some acquaintance on the coast myself and would begin that very evening looking for a man to help us
that afternoon we began lopping off expenses by removing to a modest but entirely respectable hotel in kearney street and by eight in the eve ning i had started for the waterfront with one logy bill in my minds eye
logy bill i suppose stood for about all that was bad in one of the worst quarters of that metropolis
but i had pulled logy bill clear of a stout sailorman armed with a dirk some years before and bill had sworn undying friendship on the strength of it
a a ter to i knew logy bill could help me find a proper skipper and a proper boat
his positive power for evil was as great as his negative power for good and i was going to approach him on his negative side
bill would tell me which skipper was to be relied on and which was not and from the former class i would pick the man i wanted
it was an early hour for the waterfront yet darkness had settled down and i was sufficiently wary to keep the middle of the road
hulls and masts rose starkly from the mirk that edged the wharves as i reached the front and turned along the coast
dull lights shone through the windows of sailorrobbing dens but for the most part the dens were steeped in prophetic silence
they would waken into raucous life later on and by that time i hoped to have accomplished my mis sion and to be back to kearney street
presently i came to the squat little house where i had once sat out a reminiscent evening and smoked half a dozen pipes with logy bill
mounting the gloomy veranda i rapped on the door
the summons was answered by a frowsy looking chinaman
a arter to mr williams at home
i inquired
lamplight from somewhere back of the china man cast a glow over the veranda
the slant eyes gave me a catlike sizing
what manner fashion you come hey in quired the domestic with elaborate care
why you wantee logy bill
me all same friend savvy
is bill in the house
him not in house
where is he
plaps ovel town plaps makee bizness up stleet
no can tell
will he be back soon can tell makee onepiecee papertalk you givee bill
savvy
can do
with that i scribbled a line on the blank leaf of a notebook requesting logy bill to call on me at my kearney street headquarters the fol lowing morning
the chinaman took the note and closed the door and i stumbled from the ve randa halfblinded by the sudden shutting off of the lamplight
a a to four twenty feet brought me opposite the mouth of an alley
my eyesight cleared suddenly and i be came aware that a man had leaped out of the blackness of the alley and was standing in front of me
the fellow stood stiffly erect barring my path
without a word i attempted to go around him but he shifted his position
what do you want
i demanded
for answer his right fist darted toward me
expecting a hostile move i jumped back and evaded the fist
thereupon two arms went around me from be hind pinning my hands to my body
the en circling arms were like steel and the pressure they exerted drove the breath from my lungs
on leaving kearney street i had had the fore thought to slip a revolver into my pocket but the attack from behind had come before i could get at the weapon
instantly i began a fierce strug gle kicking at my captors shins and wriggling like an eel to free myself
git the letters came a husky and impatient voice from behind three of em
being thus apprised of the object of the at a a to four tack my desperate struggle became more fierce and determined
i yelled as i fought
the man behind cursed me roundly
put a stopper on is jawtackle he panted
look alive now a cleancut smashing blow on the side of my face dazed me
my limbs went limp for a few moments and i lay like a sack of meal in the arms that held me
the man in front bent over fumbling at the breast of my coat
strength rushed back to me then and i lifted my feet and planted them in the pit of the fellows stomach
the rogue fell away staggering and catching his breath
the other man flung me to the ground with an oath and i saw him jerk a knife from his pocket
before the knife could fall a third form lurched out of the darkness and i heard the sodden impact of a fist followed by the clatter of a blade on the stones
a timely arrival
i was on my knees when the two who had at tacked me pulled themselves together and took to their heels
the man whose timely appearance had turned the tide came close and lifted me to my feet tight squeak mate he volunteered but things like that are happenin here continual
well if it isnot logy bill himself
i ex claimed recognizing the hairy thickset dump ling of a man who was ranged alongside of me think were square now bill i added gro ping for my breast pocket and making sure the three envelopes were safe
dashed if it ainot bob lorry
williams thrust out his hand
whenever did you blow into frisco lorry
and whatever are ye doing around here go back to your house bill and tell you a little business on hand and want your a a to our help
in fact i was just leaving your place when those two swabs ran afoul of me
did they lift any plunder belonging to you
no you arrived in time to prevent that
lucky thing for me that you stow it glad i happened around
it was that yell o yourn that fetched me
williams was usually a man of slow and de liberate movement as befitted one of his build but he had been quick enough that night
we got back in the house and the chinaman brought a wet towel for my bruised face and served us with cigars he also gravely presented his mas ter with the note i had left
williams spelled the written words through carefully
by coming when i did he remarked reckon i saved myself a trip to kearney street
you did more than that bill i averred you kept me out of the morgue as maybe lorry
ye know the ropes hereabouts so its sort o humorous seeing ye caught like that
your idea of humor doesnot exactly jibe with my own bill i laughed
a arter to four for half an hour we chatted on various gen eral topics and then as we lighted fresh cigars i broached the business i had in mind
what i want bill said is to charter a good seaworthy little boat
the skipper must be straight and a man i can depend on
the sort o skippers i deal with are genrally a bit offcolor he grinned although the best of em donot object to a shanghaied man or two in the focsle
where is this craft ye want to go wonot be able to tell that until were two or three days at sea
he looked at me with his bulletlike eyes atwinkle
and still yere after a good clean skipper
the like o them ainot given to makin such cruises
first off theyll ask where we bound for
then know says you and the straight skipper trips his anchor and bears away with an idee that youre shady andll bear watch ing
see how it is lorry honest business nevertheless i persisted
you ought to know me well enough to be sure of that williams
how long a vyage he asked speculatively
a a ter to four several canot tell exactly
logy bill smoked and reflected
any skipper he commented finally undertake such a vyage will have a yaller streak in him somers something you got to ex pect lorry and guide yourself according
any passengers besides yourself
four passengers all told
two are ladies and i want good accommodations for them
he raised his bushy eyebrows and gave me a queer look
when i say ladies i went on mean ex actly that reckon you know your business lorry and i ainot no hand to pry into things as donot con cern me but petticoats is pretty much in the way on everything but liners and yachts
small boats like what you want not having no passenger li cense these here ladiesll sign on as stewardesses i take it and you and tother man will go as fourth and fifth mates
something like that i suppose easy fixed
the ladies being along that ought to satisfy any skipper you ainot up to anything unlawful
still its a handicap leav a a to four ing port without knowing where youre bound the papers read
they can read honolulu
we head westerly on leaving the gate send you some one in a day or two
you can take the skippers measure hire him if you want to and if you donot want to turn him down and have another try
in this way that part of the business was set tled
i stayed with williams an hour longer and when i left my friend accompanied me as far as market street
late as it was when i got back to the hotel i wrote and posted a letter to uncle rufus re questing an immediate draft for the funds of mine which he had in his keeping
then when i turned in i gave serious thought to the principal event of the evening
two men had waylaid me and made an attempt to get the three envelopes i was carrying in my pocket
how did those two men know i had the enve lopes and why was the attack made
there was but a single answer embraced in the one word vandeleur
beyond all doubt a arter to four chauncey vandeleur was proving true to mr estimate of him
i recalled sudden change of front after mrs brackett and miss anstruther had passed me their envelopes
then and there was born his design to secure the three documents at one stroke add the three to the fourth which he himself carried and thus have the entire matter in his own hands
vandeleur had been quick to act
i would not have believed that his retreating forehead hid so much resourcefulness
courage in the deed there was none merely a snakelike craftiness in persuading others to his lawless will
yes vandeleur was a man to be reckoned with
whatever the seabusiness that was to claim our attention clearly it would take the contents of the four envelopes to make it understandable
one envelope would not do nor two envelopes nor three
the mystery was divided in quarters quarters made the whole and the whole would give the solution
in that hour i gave mental deference to the one who had devised the scheme for giving each a a ter to four of us four what might be our just due
to suc ceed we must all work together
it would be impossible for me to call vande leur to account for the nights work
if he needed our envelopes it was none the less true that we needed his envelope
no the fellow must be borne with somehow until the four envelopes had worked out the theoretical part of our prob lem
during the practical demonstration of it i could handle him without gloves
perhaps it was three oclock when i went to sleep
if i am not mistaken that was the hour chimed by a distant bell before i dozed off
when i awoke it was a bluff knock on the door that brought me upright in my bed
the sun flooded the room and in a moment that far away clock began tolling the hour
my last waking memories were of that bell
i counted the strokes one two three and so on up to eleven
evidently i had secured my proper allotment of sleep
the last echo of the bell was taken up by re peated clamor at the door there
i demanded getting my feet on the floor
boy from the office sir came the response
a arter to gentleman to see waiting down stairs
who is he
captain golden sir
he says mr williams sent him
tell captain golden that be down in a few minutes said logy bill had been active enough in finding a skipper for me
captain golden eh
i said to myself as i got into my clothes
that name is a good omen for a quartet of fortunehunters i must say
a search for a ship
when i reached the office the boy led me to an corner where captain gold en was waiting
he was puffing at one of those long crudely rolled weeds which pass by the name of stogies
as i approached he pulled the stogy from between his teeth and got slowly to his feet
i found him some six feet of a man in a dingy cap worn blue pilotcloth coat with brass but tons dungaree trousers and seaboots
judging from his rig his last voyage had not been pros perous
the captain and i surveyed each other as the distance lessened between us
following a first comprehensive look my eyes sought his face and dwelt there
it was a lean strong face brown and weather beaten as became a man of the sea
a green patch covered the left eye
the other eye was steelblue and glisteningkeen enough appar a a ter to four ently to do service for itself and its defunct mate
in the forehead above the green patch there was a dent not at all pretty to look at
a red torpedo beard bristled from the lower jaw
the hair overlong and fringing the bottom of the cap was of even a more pronounced red than the beard
red hair for fighters was my mental com ment not difficult to account for that miss ing eye or the concavity above it
then aloud captain golden
i queried
the same he returned extending a hand that carried but three fingers and a thumb
mr robert lorry i take it
exactly
i looked around
the boy had disappeared and we could be quite by ourselves in the corner
i drew up a chair as the skipper seated himself
you come from mr williams i understand the idea as the man says
he said you wanted to hire a boat do
what sort of a boat have you
the lady may finest twosticker that ever sailed out o frisco
jam er on the wind an 7o a a to four shell show her heels to anything under canvas as the man says her size
hunnerd an fifty tons
where is she
alongside pier twelve on the front her condition
jest been cleaned painted an overhauled
everything spick an span from truck to keelson
she was sealin last trip but shell never go agin
i been two months gettin the smell out o her as sweet as a rose now an i ainot afeared to show er to nobody pay her a visit at one oclock captain
if the boat suits me well go into matters a little and perhaps we can do business answered captain golden
pier twelve is the place and youll find me aboard when you get there
he touched a match to the end of his stogy got under weigh and rolled the length of the office and out at the door
he talked fair enough and had the look of a skipper who knew how to do things
having missed breakfast i was among the a a ter to four first to go in to dinner when the diningroom doors were thrown open
style and a scale of prices to match make all the difference between a light repast at noon and a square meal and what was luncheon at the palace was a regular dinner there in kearney street
i had finished and left the hotel before mrs brackett and miss anstruther came into the di ningroom
it was just as well
when i next saw the ladies perhaps i could report that a skip per and a boat had been secured
i had no difficulty in picking up the lady may even before i had seen the gilt lettering across the stern
she lay at her moorings softly rubbing her fenders against the planks
approaching from the south and before turn ing upon the pier i was able to take in the crafts length and height along the starboard side
she was dazzlingly fresh in a coat of new paint her decks were scrubbed to snowy whiteness her stays whipped and tarred masts and booms new slushed brasswork glittering and all running gear coiled down trimly
from stem to taffrail i should judge that she measured full ninety feet
she had a bow like a a a ter to four knifes edge and a run that seemed incapable of drawing a bucketful of dead water after it in a days sail
her masts were raking and so high that i thought the schooner must be crank
a glance at the beam however dispelled the impression
i strolled along and gained the pier my gaze still traveling over the boat
i was already in love with her and hoped in my soul that captain golden and i might come to terms
my best girl mr lorry called a voice
what do you think o her
i looked around and saw the skipper standing at the top of a gangplank aft as pretty as a belle in her best bib and tucker i answered heartily
she was a gentlemans yacht once before she fell into my hands an took to trading
come aboard sir been over her with a tooth brush an shell stand close inspection
i crossed the plank and captain golden led me to the focsle where the inspection began
the was a commodious place with twelve bunkssix on a side in two tiers her complement captain
i inquired
a a ter to ur master mate six hands cook an cabinboy
on our way aft from the we had a look in at the galley and then descended the after companion to the cabin
this latter room was a marvel of maple gilt and mahogany
the captains room and mates room opened off the port side of the cabin while two doors to starboard led to staterooms
the staterooms naturally were small yet each was neatly fur nished and had double berths
such an undue proportion of cabin space for ward and aft bespoke the yacht
as the captain and i seated ourselves for a business talk i no ticed a rack against the cabin bulkhead with half a dozen wincester rifles well armed captain golden i ob served my gaze dropping from the rack to the skippers glittering blue eye
as the man says he answered with a slight grin always well for the afterguard to be prepared for emergencies
i never go hunting for trouble but you can bet always prepared an donot dodge any
did logy bill tell you anything about the sort of cruise were going to start on
a a to four nary a whisper
where are you going and how long do you expect to be gone donot know where i am blue eye flickered and halfclosedand consequently i canot tell how long well be gone
most remarkable was dry response
do you happen to know mr lorry whether your business is straight or crooked
i straightened stiffly
beggin your pardon an no offense meant went on golden
mayhap you know logy reputation
he sent me to forget that honest work captain golden said i sharply
boats have sailed under sealed orders before i take it and havenot done anything pi ratical either
sealed orders he exclaimed sucking in his breath and his eye glimmering
so thats the lay of it hey
when do you open your orders
three days westward of the gate different
i draw the line at pearlin among jap islands or smuggling chinks or pop pyjuice into the states or arms an ammunition out of it
if its straight goods and only a mat a a to four ter o learning our destination three days out why as the man says your huckleberry
long vyage
several months possibly
that suits me uncommon
the longer the time the bigger the lay
any passengers besides yourself
three two of them ladies
he jumped at that and began to look dubious
mebby you know how it is at sea mr lorry he observed
now an agin we have to use lan guage which the hands understand
think the ladiesll object to that
give them personally all the consideration you can said and i think they will be satisfied
this point covered we fell to debating terms
at the end of half an hour we had reached an agreement
i was to give captain golden one hundred and fifty dollars a month for the use of the boat pay the wages of master mate and crew pay for towing pilotage harbordues and other inciden tals provision the craft for six months and hand over one thousand dollars advancemoney inside of two weeks
nothing further was to be done a a ter to four by captain golden until the preliminary payment was in his hands
he looked askance at the delay until i ex plained that the money was to come from the east
we drained a glass to the success of our cruise and parted good friends
i was mightily pleased and tried to find will iams and learn something about past history but williams was abroad and i turned my steps toward kearney street
when i got back to the hotel i found vande leur waiting for me in the office
he came for ward handling his cane nervously and with something like anxiety in his shifty eyes
dis sembling my real feelings i greeted him amiably have a suggestion to make mr lorry said he seemingly relieved by my show of friendli what is it
suppose you give me those three envelopes and let me take all four over to mr office and have him put them in his safe
it was artlessly said
the fellows simplicity might have deceived me had it not been for the events of the night before
a art to four those envelopes are as safe in my pocket as they are in mr safe mr vandeleur i assured him shall always go armed you know i finished dropping my voice while i have them about me
i know how to shoot too if any one tries foul play
his face paled a little and the rattan quivered in his yellowgloved hand
his next move was a puzzle
reaching into the breast of his coat he took out his envelope
for a moment he held it and looked at it then presented it to me
if got the right of this thing mr lorry he said one envelope is of no earthly use with out the other three
you might just as well keep the lot
if the ladies can trust you i ought to be able to
all right mr vandeleur i acquiesced if you want it that way
you will open them he hesitated per haps wondering whether i would take it upon myself to get at the contents of the envelopes at once
when we have been three days at sea said again he appeared relieved
a a to four have you done anything toward getting a boat he inquired have chartered the lady may a hundred schooner captain nathan golden
his head was bent and he was rapping his cane aimlessly against one of his shoes
do you know anything about captain gold en he went on
he comes to me well recommended and cer tainly his schooner is all that we could desire
relief again
vandeleur had not the knack of hiding his feelings
how long do you think it will be before we get to sea
some time within two weeks
with that i excused myself and went up to my room
vandeleur was a riddle and i wanted to get away by myself while i gave some thought to his particular case
once inside my room i locked the door threw off coat and vest filled and lighted a pipe and laid the four mysterious envelopes on a table
vandeleur i knew as well as i knew that i was alive was back of that attempt to get the three envelopes away from me
failing in that he had a art to just come at me schoolboy fashion with the re quest that i give him the envelopes to take to mr price for safekeeping
and when he had failed in that he had given me his own document to keep with the others
bending over the envelopes i compared them
they were all of a size identical in color and ap parently made out of the same kind of paper
yet there was a differencehard to detect but it did not escape me
the three envelopes be longing to mrs brackett miss anstruther and myself all bore the same watermark vande leurs envelope bore another
now i might have been well within my rights being honorably disposed and with the inter ests of my companions at heartif i had opened the envelopes and learned our destination
such a proceeding however would have a tendency to discredit me with mrs brackett and miss an struther besides i hated to trust myself with the knowledge contained in the envelopes before we got to sea
i went the length however of opening van deleurs envelope
it contained simply a piece of blank paper
by holding the other envelopes be a a to our tween my eye and the window i could see that they held written enclosures
vandeleur still had his original envelope and had tried to fool me by giving me a dummy
why
for nothing less i imagined than to parry any suspicions i might cherish against him on account of that futile night attack
there was a lack of will shown in his retreating chin and mental de ficiencies might be argued from his retreating forehead
nevertheless he was playing a cool game and he was playing it craftily deliberately and well
my cue was to let him think he had pulled the wool entirely over my eyes
after the third day out he would find that i had been keeping a rod in pickle for him
my worry concentrated about this one point that vandeleur might in some way let the en velope given him by mr price get out of his possession
if he held onto that i was sure i could handle the rest of it
sealed orders
eight days of uneasiness followed
mrs and miss serenity was ruffled by the mystery that hedged about our un dertaking and by a suspense of hopes and fears that had mainly to do with their relatives but my own doubts reached farther and i kept them in ignorance of the cause
there was always vandeleur of course to fret me and as the days passedwithout a letter i be gan to have forebodings about uncle rufus and the funds
uncle rufus had labored hard to keep my patrimony intact and conservatively invested yet what if in spite of his vigilance the money had been invested and lost
every day i had several hours conversation with mrs brackett and miss anstruther
to cheer and distract their thoughts i took them for little excursions about the cityto the parks to chinatown to the theaters to inspect the lady may
a arter to four i will not deny that i took rare comfort in miss society that i came to look forward to these brief excursions and to enjoy them in spite of the many matters i had to harass me
i had been drawn toward miss anstruther from the first and the realization that my heart was trending inevitably in her direction came to me suddenly
vandeleur likewise paid miss anstruther his attentions
it was this fact i think that brought me to an abrupt understanding of my own feel ings
miss anstruther seldom discriminated between vandeleur and me
sometimes i was her escort and vandeleur piloted mrs brackett and some times it was the other way around
yet gradu ally and in spite of my attempt to keep it hidden the breach widened between vandeleur and my self
on the evening of the eighth day of our proba tion in kearney street i received a letter from uncle rufus and had the satisfaction of finding a draft for seven thousand dollars enclosed
the greater part of my worry at once took wings al a a to ur though uncle rufus letter was something to make a man think
the old gentleman implored me to leave my wandering life interlarding his supplication with passages from scripture he admonished me not to waste my substance in risk and adventure but to settle down engage in some christian business and make myself a credit to the community which should finally claim me
he deplored the fact that my cousin career had been such as to appeal to my roaming nature and lead to emu lation and he offered a dire prophecy of priva tion and worse should i fail to heed his final words
uncle rufus was in poor health and did not believe that he was long for this world
his brother jeremiah had been killed in the boxer uprising in china and while the missionary had been a martyr to the christian faith and uncle rufus gloried in it yet the blow had been a hard shall i admit it
there were tears in my eyes as i put aside the good mans letter
i had laid a course directly contrary to his ad vice and i was risking every dollar i had in the a a ter to world on a single throw
more than that my cousin arthur was at the root of the venture
that was an unpleasant night i passed but i arose with determination unshaken
my first move was to acquaint my companions with the fact that our venture was ready for launching
then i hurried to find captain golden and for two days we were more than busy
stores were purchased and hustled off to the lady may by the drayload
the crew were got aboard and the blood sang in my veins as i watched sailors and stevedores trample the schooners white decks and stow her cargo
on the second day after that draft had wrought its magic mrs brackett and miss anstruther came aboard with their luggage vandeleur following later
the tide turned at eight in the evening and we were to go out with it
a little after six oclock logy bill hove alongside and beckoned me to the pier
ready for the start are ye he asked lead ing me a little apart and dropping his voice
all ready i answered complacently
what dye think of golden
a arter to four he looks to me like a man i can depend on
he looked that way to me lorry or never have sent him to ye
reckon he knows that dude whos takin the trip with ye
why said with a start and a quick look at my companion golden hasnot said anything about it and neither has vandeleur
well i just got it pretty straight that them two have been thick as sardines in a box for the past couple o days
you know your own busi ness lorry and if what i tell ye is any news you can turn it over in your block
as i said at the startoff any skipper whod deal with you would have a yaller streak in him somers
you donot know anything to dis credit
not a thing and not a thing to his credit either if it comes to that
but the mates a whole sailor and a man
stubbs his name is and you can count on him to do whats white in all weathers
just remember that
captain golden was leaning over the rail star ing at us
williams saw him mentioned the cir cumstance sotto voce wrung my hand wished me luck and went away
a a to four later when the wharfhouses began to fade in the dusk and the city lights twinkled out on the hills i leaned over the afterrail while the tug raced us down the harbor
there was with my all wrapped up in a risky venture with two women under convoy with un known business and an unknown port ahead with one known enemy in my party and with a final doubt inspired as to the schooners captain
when was i to see san francisco again
and was i to return victor or vanquished
the mate was bawling orders within a few yards of me and the hands were scrambling about alow and aloft sweating out the canvas
i gave no attention to the orderly disorder of sea manship but continued to lean over the rail and watch the passing lights
a hand touched my arm
mr lorry murmured a voice
miss anstruther
i exclaimed
she leaned on the rail beside me
of what are you thinking she asked softly
i was silent
perhaps i know she went on her voice aquiver with feeling
you are thinking of your a a to four responsibilities wondering whether you are do ing right in taking mrs brackett and myself away you know not where and exposing us to unforeseen dangers
you have risked a good deal of money too andpardon me for saying do not think it is money you could afford to lose
as for mrs brackett and myself mr lorry we accompany you of our own free will
we have nothing but gratitude for your generosity and kindness
more than that you will not find that we are a drag upon you
we are prepared to face bravely whatever comes
as for myself may i ask you to be entirely frank with me con cerning our difficulties
will you let me share the anxieties that are bound to come
oh i know what you think
you think i am a woman and ought to be spared the mental wor ries and the hardships but mr lorry i am capable of bearing my full part and i insist that you let me do it
will you
while i doubted the policy of the step she sug gested yet there was no gainsaying her
after we have been three days at sea miss anstruther said and the business of our ex a a to our pedition unfolds itself more tangibly i shall be happy to take you into my full confidence and to look to you for advice
two heads are wiser than one you know i smiled and really you are the only one of our party with whom i should care to counsel
if she felt surprise because my words gave vandeleur the cold shoulder she gave no evi dence of it
her small hand fluttered whitely toward me in the dusk as i gently clasped it in my big palm she said softly thank you thank you ever so much
now please do not worry about mrs brackett and me
i have passed several sleepless nights because it was your money that financed this queer under taking and because i feared you might lose it but i am quite easy in my mind now mr lorry
somehow the conviction has crept over me that our expedition is to prove a grand success and that you have merely cast your bread upon the waters
her hand lingered in mine until she had fin ished speaking then she withdrew it bade me a hasty good night and fluttered like a wraith down the aftercompanion
a protesting voice
midnight saw us well up on the farallones the lady may dancing prettily through the open sea
not until then did i go below and turn in
vandeleur and i had one of the staterooms
he had appropriated the lower berth and was snoring loudly
although the quarters were cramped and the staggering of the ship threw me around some what while i was disrobing yet i managed to get into my blankets without waking my room mate
the three envelopes i took to bed with me merely to be on the safe side
that first night must have been one of horror for mrs brackett
the poor old lady had never been on a boat before and her discomforts be gan early be all right when she gets used to it mum grinned captain golden addressing miss anstruther and referring to mrs brackett who was not able to leave her stateroom
a a to four we were at breakfast in the cabin the four of anstruther vandeleur the skipper and myself
vandeleur sat at right and i at his left miss anstruther was at side of the board and the vacant chair beside me was reserved for mrs brackett
opposite the captains end of the table was the mates place
stubbs would eat by himself when the rest of us had finished
by jove miss anstruther observed vande leur with an admiring sidewise glance you seem to be quite a sailor have crossed the ocean twice returned miss anstruther with a glance at me and it was a rough passage both times but i was not a bit uncomfortable
the lady may ainot a liner by no means pursued the skipper but shes as stanch as one even if she does tumble about more do mum as the man says bank on you even when we run into a gale an begin turning hand springs
you seem to be perfectly at home on a boat mr lorry said miss anstruther
ever since we had taken our chairs she had a a to four been trying to draw me into the conversation but i preferred to keep silence and watch van deleur and the skipper for some sign of an under standing between them
like yourself miss anstruther i laughed have been to sea before had about made up my mind mr lorry cut in the skipper that you could tell a topping lift from a reefpoint
about day after tomor row i suppose well know where were going hope so captain
the crew of course is a bit curious the trouble on vyages like this when you donot know where youre going when you start out nor what youre going to do when you get there
the fairly bils with wrong idees an all the hands are upsot an onsettled
but curry em down as the man says if the need comes
as soon as the men find out what port were bound for i returned probably become easy in their minds
the port were bound for ainot the whole of it mr lorry
golden dropped his hands on the tableedge and fixed the blue eye on me
the swabs overhaul their braintackle an a a to four wonder whats in the wind when we make land fall
but i ainot stewin none
the skipper grinned expansively can take a pin or a blessed ropesend an make a blackjack or a blackbirder out o evry duckfoot aboard but seeing as how we got ladies with us an donot want no knockdown and dragout mayhap it would be as well to let the crew have a workin knowledge o whats going on my business captain golden i snapped resenting his wishywashy attempt to get at the nub of our enterprise you and your men will know as much or as little as i see fit to tell
that was straight talk for the skipper and in his own cabin too
he stiffened and the red ran into his face
for a moment i thought he would give me as good as i sent but he changed his mind
his temper passed in an indulgent grin and he got up from the table giving me my whack for this deal mr lorry he remarked starting for the companion way an its your right to blow the gaff or crawl farther back into your shell as you please but as master o this boat got to know our a a to destination either stick a pin in the proper pint on the chart when were three days out or i bout ship an put back to frisco an keep the advancemoney
i wanted golden to understand my position and was glad of the opportunity to make it clear to him
vandeleur followed the skipper to the deck and miss anstruther with an earnest look at me went back to mrs brackett
stubbs re lieved by the skipper came down
he was a short thickset moonfaced man with a fringe of grayish muttonchop whiskers
i remained in the cabin long enough to pass the time of day with him and to take his sizing then climbed to the poop
it was good to sniff salt air again to watch the bellying canvas to hear the wind sing in the rig ging the waves splash alongside the mellow notes of the ships bell and to feel the heave of the deck underfoot
difficulties loomed vaguely ahead but i faced them complacently
as a passenger i was privileged to go and come as i saw fit and took advantage of this to mingle somewhat with the men
looking in at the focsle spent an hour with the watch below a a to four and later i spent another hour with all hands during the first dogwatch
my object was to measure up the men forward
the covert investigation pleased me in some re spects and displeased me in others
including master and mate cook and cabin boy the ships complement numbered a half the cook was a fortune islander the cabin boy an native of oakland
of the other six two were swedes two americans one a mexican and one a kanaka
the mexican the kanaka and the americans were a part of the flotsam and jetsam that goes broke ashore takes the first berth that offers and thinks more of a good lay than of honest means for getting it
the swedes were sturdy taci turn good seamen and thriftyand thrift of course is an evidence of character
for three days we had shifting winds and clear skies and made a fair westing
on the morning of the third day mrs brackett looking a bit pale and distressed joined us at table for the morning meal
up to the time mrs brackett presented herself a a to four i had caught only fleeting glimpses of miss an struther
nearly the whole of that third day however both ladies were on deck and appeared to enjoy the experience
at eight bells of the second dogwatch cap tain golden came to me where i stood leaning against the cabin near the break of the poop and touched my arm the time for you to open your sealed orders mr lorry said the skipper
no more going it blind after tonight
may we have the use of the cabin
i asked
help yourself
stubbs has just turned out and stay on deck with him an give you the run of everything aft below
but i want to know where were going when youre done with your chinning thats all
i turned away and descended the companion stairs closing the doors after me
vandeleur sat under a ships lamp in the cabin reading a book and smoking a cigarette
he made as though he would leave when i came down
wait mr vandeleur said we are three days out and it is time to hold our conference and open the envelopes
a a ter to he was nervous and ill at ease
you have my envelope and it isnot necessary for me to remain he observed shiftily
i understood very well what ailed him
he did not care to be present when i opened that dummy envelope which he had given me
it is necessary for you to remain i answered sternly
sit down
my show of authority dismayed him and sent him back into his chair
he watched apprehen sively while i knocked at the stateroom door to summon mrs brackett and miss anstruther
the ladies appeared immediately miss an struther supporting mrs brackett and helping her across the rocking floor to a chair
deary me sighed mrs brackett wasnot never meant to be a sailor i guess
what is it mr lorry
we are going to open the envelopes mrs brackett said oh
there was a flutter of excitement on the part of both ladies
taking one of the pivotal chairs i swung to the table and laid three envelopes in front of me thank you for your envelope mr vande a arter to four leur said i sharply giving the young man a steady glance
what do you mean he demanded weakly
just what i say
i want your envelope
look here lorry he cried pulling himself together is this a joke
not so far as i am concerned
why i gave you my envelope before we left san francisco
that is where the joke comes in vandeleur
the envelope you gave me contained nothing but a piece of blank paper
then the joke is on all of us vandeleur remarked with a feeble attempt at levity
more than likely all the envelopes contain pieces of blank paper
mrs brackett wrung her hands and miss an struther looked startled
what i want from you vandeleur i went on is the envelope mr price gave younot the one you handed me in san francisco
he fell back in his chair making a pitiable attempt to dissemble
by jove he stuttered do you mean to in sinuate tha py a a to four come i cut in briskly keep us wait ing
vandeleur recovered himself a little got out of his chair and swaggered toward me bound to force my hand are you he cried coming to a halt bracing himself and glowering at me with his buttermilk eyes am i returned calmly just that
please mr vandeleur pleaded miss an struther in an agitated voice
we must all work together you know or we cannot hope for success be troublesome admonished mrs brackett in a tone of paternal tolerance now of all times
vandeleur turned and bowed to miss an struther
my actions miss anstruther went on van deleur melodramatically spring from a due re gard for your interests and mine
you ladies donot know anything about this fellow lorry but i have been at some pains to look him up
from what i have learned about him i assure you that he is not a man to be trusted
he drew up to a arter to four his full height
personally he finished with a flourish decline to trust him
mrs brackett and miss anstruther stared first at vandeleur and then at me
another man than vandeleur making such a speech would have heard from me promptly but there was a ludicrous side to this affair and it completely dwarfed the youths insolence
perhaps i spoke up dryly you had better tell the ladies what you know know he cried turning fiercely and level ing at me a finger yellowed with cigarettes that you are an adventurer and that you will stoop to anything to feather your own nest
is that all vandeleur enough i think
i lifted his clenched right hand and brought it down in the open palm of his demand that you turn those three envelopes over to me and make me the leader of this expedition
silence followed silence broken only by the slap of waves alongside the straining of timbers a tramp of feet overhead shall be glad said i finally to yield to the a arter will of the majority
if the ladies want you for a leader vandeleur let them say so
good gracious exclaimed mrs brackett with a long breath
whoever heard of such a thing
here mr lorry furnishes the money to take us goodness knows where and makes it pos sible for us to find out whether theres anything or nothing back of this trip and mr vandeleur thanks him by going into a tantrum like that
young man she added severely giving van deleur a withering look wouldnot have stirred a step if it hadnot been for mr lorry and i wonot go a mile farther into this big ocean unless he has entire charge of the party feel the same way mr vandeleur said miss anstruther
do be reasonable
for an instant the wind seemed taken out of sails
then he got himself in hand again am going to look after your interests in spite of you said he puffing out his chest like an angry robin
before long both of you ladies will thank me for it
he started for the companion stairs
before he had taken three steps i had him by the collar a a to four and had laid him squirming back down on the table
he clawed kicked shouted threats and bawled for help
in spite of his puny struggles i pushed a hand into the breast of his coat and drew out the envelope which i knew to be there
then i flung him aside
he toppled to the floor but sprang up fuming and rushed for the deck am sorry ladies i remarked that i found it necessary to use force
vandeleur however has queer ideas and we cannot allow him to men ace the success of our enterprise
you did exactly right mr lorry approved miss anstruther
now let us open the en velopes before there is any more interference
why who else is there to interfere fluttered mrs bracktt
no one i hope answered miss anstruther but mr vandeleur will appeal to captain gold en andand i must confess that i do not like captain looks
i was tearing open the envelopes while miss anstruther was speaking
a dissected clue
the problem of the four envelopes had so com pletely won me that i gave little attention to the clash with vandeleur
at least one of the veils that shrouded our mission was about to lift
a few moments after vandeleur had left the ladies forgot him as utterly as i had done
lean ing forward over the table they watched breath lessly the swinging lamp overhead throwing our shadows weirdly across the tabletop
each envelope contained a piece of cardboard some three inches square
on the back of each piece was the name of the person who had re ceived it with the words in parentheses im carefully
on the reverse side of my piece and vande leurs were figures with degree minute and sec ondmarks and the letters and on the reverse side of mrs and miss an struthers pieces were words painstakingly printed in a bold hand
a a to four it looks like a dissected puzzle said miss anstruther
hardly a puzzle said for the pieces go together without difficulty
they are our instruc tions miss anstruther cut into quarters and each piece sent to one of the four who are en titled to a knowledge of the whole
i juggled the pieces about until they lay as fol lows fortunel island 14940io io1230 mouth of sea calve on east side ten teakwlood cases there it is
i exclaimed exultantly
mrs brackett tremblingly adjusted a pair of spectacles and bowed her head close to the four rejoined quarters canot make out one thing she murmured
what does it all mean anyway
why mrs brackett returned miss an struther with repressed excitement you a a ter to four see that by fitting those cards together in that way we find out where we are to go donot suppose very bright zelda said mrs brackett shaking her head helplessly but then i ainot so young as i used to be and there are a lot of things past my understanding
what are those figures with the funny marks after them
those figures give us the latitude and longi tude of fortune island explained the girl pa tiently
with those figures to guide him cap tain golden can lay our course for the island
so its an island were going to
yes
not one of these cannibal islands queried mrs brackett in sudden alarm
there are no cannibal islands in this day and age of the world mrs brackett i hastened to reassure her
thank goodness for that brackett
when i was a girl i about godless people that eat one hate to land on an island where sighed mrs used to read another and they did such things
but if my boy tom is on that island and here her face hardened resolutely find a a to ur him if the place is crowded with cannibals
but what does the rest of that printing mean
that i explained is something for us to investigate when we get there
some one i went on donot know who has taken a great deal of pains to set us on the right track
all this you see was printed on a large card the card was then cut into four pieces and a quarter sent to each of us
that is where the quarter to four comes in i suppose
so cleverly were the instructions printed on the large card that when quartered all four pieces were necessary before the instructions could be read
this of course was to keep any one of us from obtaining an advantage over the others
to learn this clue to our destination we were all obliged to bring our quarters and lay them together
a very simple plan but entirely effect ive
taking my notebook from my pocket i wrote out the name of the island and the latitude and longitude twice each description on a separate leaf
one of the leaves i tore out to give to captain golden
a a ter to you ladies understand i think i proceeded laying the detached leaf on the table and return ing the notebook to my pocket that mr van deleur is not to be trusted
he is entitled to a quarterly share in our enterprise and we will deal with him justly no matter how he elects to deal with us but i think the information we have just developed should be kept from him
vandeleur has mistaken ideas
we must not for get that we know little of captain golden and even less of his crew
if we told vandeleur everything and he made a confidant of captain golden we donot say that we would but that we mightmake trouble for ourselves
it is better to be on the safe side
dear dear faltered mrs brackett becom ing nervous do hope we wonot have any trouble with anybody
mr vandeleur knows enough already to whet captain curiosity put in miss an struther
if the captains cupidity were aroused and as i said before i donot like the mans lookswe might find the whole ship against us
it couldnot be so bad as that miss anstruther i am sure said i hastily for certainly there are a a ter to four some honest hands aboard the schooner
please donot be alarmed by what i said
i spoke as i did merely to emphasize the need of caution with regard to vandeleur
have you fixed in your mind the printed words on your card and mrs
the girl leaned over the cards for a moment then looked up with a nod
taking a match from my pocket i burned the cards one by one pow dered the little heap of black ashes and dropped them on the floor
let me warn both of you said to say nothing not a word
i will give that leaf on the table to captain golden and it will tell him all that he needs to know
if vandeleur tries to talk with either of you please refer him to me afraid mourned mrs brackett that this work of ours wonot be clear sailing after all a pretty old woman to be mixed up in any trouble mr lorry
it was only the thought of finding my boy that brought me into this and while its mighty fine to think of securing a for tune toofor goodness knows poverty poor at this very minutestill a woman of my years hasnot any business philanderin around the ocean a a ter to four looking for a pot o gold hunting for tom thats all and now that weve made a good start you can count on me to keep my best foot for ward shall do all i can to avoid trouble mrs brackett said i earnestly both on your ac count and on miss i might add on my own as well
if trouble comes it will not be of my seeking you may be sure nor because i did not do everything possible to keep away from it
why did mr vandeleur deceive you in san francisco by giving you an envelope contain ing a piece of blank paper mr lorry queried miss anstruther
you did not tell me about that she added reproachfully did not want to bother you i returned when you had so many other things to think about
i felt sure that vandeleur was trying to trick me and it was not an hour after he gave me the envelope before i investigated and discovered that it contained nothing
why did he want to trick you persisted the girl
he must have known that you would find him out sooner or later
io9 a a to four i hesitated about telling of the night attack on me on the waterfront
there was no way to avoid it however so i gave them the story briefly
mrs brackett was horrified and miss an struthers eyes flashed
only vandeleur could have inspired that at tack i went on imagine therefore that he gave me the envelope to quiet any suspicions of him that i might have formed
he is treacherous breathed miss anstruther indignantly
you are perfectly right not to trust him with any information
of course he shall have his share of whatever we find but it is plain that we must do all the work ourselves and perhaps we shall have to do it in the face of his open hostility
our conference had proceeded thus far when it was interrupted by the opening of the compan ion doors
captain golden and vandeleur came down the stairs
vandeleur was fuming
the skippers single eye held a baleful gleam and i saw that he car ried a revolver in his hand
miss anstruther i requested in a low tone i a a to will you and mrs brackett please retire to your stateroom will take mrs brackett to the stateroom the girl whispered rising from her chair pale but resolute and then i shall return and take my place at your side beg of you my mind is made up mr lorry she broke in decisively
while she supported mrs brackett across the rocking floor i got up braced myself against the chairback and faced the skipper and vandeleur
who the trouble here demanded captain golden planting himself in front of me legs wide apart his ominous eye raking me up and down
no trouble captain i answered easily
mr vandeleur here says there is
by jove stuttered vandeleur the scoun drel laid hands on me threw me down on that table and took a document out of my pocket
he used violence captain golden thats what he did got that document yet and i demand it back your indictment mr lorry as the man says came sternly from the skipper the only man that has a right to use violence on this foreanafter an i wonot have my passen gers robbin an sluggin each other
do you rise to that
i nodded
miss anstruther at that moment glided forward and took her station at my side
i a a to four a lady present captain golden said and your revolver is out of place
before i put up this gun went on the skip per doggedly want to know whether or not youre going to give dockyment back to him am not
that document and three others have been destroyed
destroyed cried vandeleur in a voice that throbbed and choked with wrath
if hes des troyed those papers captain golden then by gad
i call on you to put him in irons
i had as much right to those papers as any one and if he destroyed them he did it because he wants to rob me that will do vandeleur said i sharply step ping toward him
he jumped back and behind golden as though fearing i was about to lay hands on him again
avast there warned the skipper putting out his arm
what business you got destroyin property belonging to vandeleur
whatever business it is captain golden at least it is no business of yours
my gorge was rising
something touched my a a to sleeve as though to arouse in me a realizing sense of what i was doing
i dropped my eyes and saw miss small white hand
i gave her a reassuring glance out of the clew of my eye then picked from the table the leaf with the longitude and latitude of our destina tion
this is a fitting time for us to come to an understanding captain i announced
he ducked his head fixing himself to say something ironical but i cut in ahead hold here a slip of paper giving the bearings of our destination but before i turn it over to you i must know whether you intend to live up to your contract swith me
he vouchsafed no response
who owns the lady may i pursued
you know as well as i do he snarled
and whos her skipper
what sort of a fool question is that
who chartered the schooner
you did
who signed the contract and put up the ad vancemoney
yoti did
i a a ter to so it follows that the lady may her skipper and crew are under my orders for a period not exceeding six months
providin your business is honest he quali fied insinuatingly not so bloomin sure of that yet
it is honest and i own you and your boat for the period of our contract
there are three per sons aboard who are my brackett miss anstruther and a vandeleur
if i choose to have you put in at honolulu and leave vandeleur youll do it
that caught the skipper
it also made a salu tary impression upon vandeleur changed quick glances
you ainot treatin the two ex vandeleur much like a guest mumbled captain golden easing off a bit on his temper
that is an affair between vandeleur and me
you have nothing whatever to do with it
now then once for all are you going to continue this voyage or are you going to put back to san francisco
if youll tell me where were going he an swered sulkily continue the voyage
a a ter to very good said handing him the paper the latitude and longitude of our first landfall here i turned grimly on young man doesnot make it necessary for me to put him ashore at honolulu
you havenot any right to go through with this business without me babbled vandeleur his face turning a sickly gray
he was thoroughly cowed and not a little frightened have a moral right to do anything i see fit that will make for the good of this expedition i declared
if you are foolish enough to try to meddle with me and so increase our difficulties we shall certainly drop you off somewhere until the work is done
i have a share he asked his appeal ing gaze traveling from me to miss anstruther
certainly mr vandeleur spoke up miss an struther
mr lorry intends to protect your in terests
if you will be advised by me you will do exactly as he says got me in a corner was sullen response so i suppose have to jump whenever he cracks the whip
what do you a a to our want me to do he jerked out turning in my di rection
sheer away and keep to yourself until this boat puts into san francisco again said i promptly
and keep a still tongue in your head i added with a significant glance at the skipper who had his back to us overhauling some charts do that by jove growled vandeleur with a black look
and if you play me false lorry donot forget that have an accounting
if i find i continued ignoring his last re mark that you are not acting strictly in accord ance with my instructions after we lay our south erly course i shall have you transferred to the first ship we fall in with
he bent his brows at me but made no answer
captain golden he called
well interrogated the skipper looking up from a chart which he had laid over the table decline to occupy the same stateroom with this man any longer
have i your permission to bunk in the focsle
you can bunk in the crosstrees for all me snapped the skipper but you better ask mr
a a to four lorry
he seems to be cock o the walk on this hooker at the present speakin
bunk wherever you please said vandeleur carried a deeply injured air across the cabin and into our stateroom and he carried it out again together with a couple of suitcases and a hatbox
he never deigned a look in miss direction or mine until he reached the foot of the companion stairs
then he whirled about match my wits against yours any day lorry he scowled
as for miss anstruther and mrs brackett just let them remember that a man wholl steal for them will steal from them
with that vandeleur lurched up the stairs and out onto the deck
miss anstruther gave me a faint smile
evidently her appreciation of van deleurs performance was equal to my own
no such place called captain golden a fin ger of his mutilated hand resting on the chart before him off soundings with this lati tude an longitude o yours mr lorry
what do you mean
i queried stepping to his side no such island down on the chart
i if a a to four its the fortune islands youre after theyre way off not after the fortune islands
that other fortune island ainot charted
a glance at the chart showed me that he was right
it was an admiralty chart and a good cine
the island is there all right said i confi dently even if it isnot down on the chart
golden shook his head
some ones handed you a gold brick he averred
them four en velopes where did you hear anything about four en velopes
i interrupted sharply
the skipper looked blank for an instant
why said he getting the whiphand of him self we talk about them envelopes when vandeleur an i come down
not that i know of i returned shortly
then vandeleur told me afore we come down
anyhow you an your friends have been gold bricked as i says not your affair captain golden i observed deliberately
take us to the spot in dicated
if we find open water then well bout a a ter to ship and return to san francisco in sured against loss no matter what happens said he then put away the chart and went on deck to give the man at the wheel oll1 se
you did very well indeed mr lorry said miss anstruther cannot begin to tell you how glad i am that you did not come to any vio lence with captain golden
that lesson in whos who was coming to the captain i answered profit by it i think
still she murmured do not trust him
it almost seems as though there is some understand ing between the captain and mr vandeleur
certainly mr vandeleur has told captain golden more than was necessary
no doubt and when vandeleur gets into the focsle he may proceed to enlighten the crew
but i donot see how we can help that too bad commiserated miss anstruther that we should have such a contraryminded per son in our party
however as you say it can not be helped so we must make the best of it
it was a good stroke to burn the four cards and a a to four not trust mr vandeleur with the rest of the in formation
it wonot be long i suppose until every one on the ship knows that we are making for an uncharted island
that will be common gossip before many days
what will the crew think of us and our mis sion
the first thing a sailor always thinks of on a voyage like ours is treasure
they will im agine probably that were going after pearls
a mysterious voyage is quite apt to whet a mari ners curiosity
and the idea of pearls is quite apt to whet his greed is it not
in that miss anstruther had struck the key note
i marveled at her foresight
are you an optimist miss anstruther
i smiled try to be she answered catching my spirit and also smiling
then as optimists we will not cross any bridges until we come to them
yet it is well donot you think to imagine i a a ter to what lies before us and try to be prepared for whatever may happen
exactly so i agreed my eyes wandering to the rack that held the rifles
she noticed my glance at the firearms and dropped her head with a little shiver
you will not forget what you promised me while we were being towed down the bay she asked will not forget
you will find miss an struther that i shall rely upon your judgment a great deal
you may rely upon me in other ways too
perhaps mr lorry and her eyes danced as they rose to mine have more courage than you are pleased to credit me with
at any rate i shall stand at your side no matter what comes
good night
good night said and we separated to go to our a bonny girl truly ran the current of my thoughts a girl to fight with and a girl to fight for
who could not succeed in any undertaking with zelda anstruther at his side
the i had always plenty of food for thoughtthe obscure details of our enterprise offered me that and the progress of events was continually warping my mental processes to a different angle
for instance my speculations dealt often with the mysterious unknown who had written out our directions quartered them and distributed them so oddly
who was this person
and why was he hiding his hand and foregoing a part in the expedition
nay more if there was a fortune to be had why did he not go after it himself in stead of turning it over to others
then too what sort of a fortune was it
of what did it consist
inasmuch as i had staked my all on the ven ture it may be that i gave the outcome more thought than did any of the others
they were deeply interested of course but hardly to the ex tent that i was
a fresh viewpoint was mine when i learned a arter to four that the ostensible fortune lay somewhere over sea
the angle changed with the treacherous maneuvers of vandeleur with the information that our landfall lay well down in the tropics that it was not charted and consequently shrouded in doubt
all these and many other develop ments kept the vague perspective constantly shifting
my one firm support was miss anstruther
come fair weather or foul success or failure i felt that she would not fail me
mrs brackett also in her way was thoroughly dependable
circumstances narrowing her life to the little world of emmetsburg had not given her the broad outlook most available for our pres ent needs
of the experience that counts in the larger affairs of existence miss anstruther had acquired infinitely more in less than half mrs years
it seemed almost a sacrilege to do or say any thing that would disturb mrs serenity or hopefulness
her artlessness and simplicity no less than her advanced years counseled me to smooth the path before her
miss anstruther on the other hand would not a a to four have contented herself one moment unless she knew herself to be in touch with every detail of our enterprise
during that first night of my lone occupancy of the stateroom we ran into some heavy weather
the lady may wrestled and tumbled with the long pacific swell and i heard much tramping about on the decks and much shouting of orders
mrs brackett was again indisposed and did not join us at breakfast
neither did vandeleur but from indisposition of another sort
he was sulky and the skipper told miss anstruther and me that he chose to eat at the second table with mr stubbs
following breakfast i took a turn on deck
the sun had appeared for only a brief space and then had withdrawn behind ominouslooking clouds
the sea was a dull leaden gray and whitecaps reared above the schooners rail and now and then tumbled aboard
a peep into the binnacle showed me the compasscard bearing southwest
the glass is down sir and were in for a sou easter said the man at the wheel
this man was one of the swedes anderson by a a to name
his easy command of english surprised i should have liked to talk with him but the skipper was pacing the lee alley and might have resented a conversation with the helmsman
with a nod to anderson i went over and sat down on the cabin
the wind was steadily increasing
captain golden tramping up and down and sidestepping with the roll of the ship appeared to be com muning with himself
all our canvas was set and drawing
every once in a while our lee rail went under and a wave swept us amidships with the windward roll and ran hissing through the scuppers
it was high time i thought that the skipper began taking in sail
however if it is bad form to talk with the man at the wheel it is even worse form to advise a skipper what to do in handling his ship
all hands had been turned out
i presumed stubbs had done that before he went below
hud dled forward i could see the men alternately staring to windward and up at the poop where a a ter to four the preoccupied skipper was mechanically pacing his round
are you anything of a seaman mr lorry shouted captain golden bracing himself near i donot know whatever put the question into his head nor what possible bearing it could have on his thoughts
it was certainly odd that he should address me in such a way at such a time enough of a seaman to know that youll have us on our beamends if you donot begin to snug down i called back to him sharply
his blue eye glinted
what reply was on his lips i never knew for at that moment a fierce gust hit us and over we went with our lee rail under
a look forward showed me vandeleur hang ing for life to a pinrail and with his heels buoyed up in the deluge that swept us
the pull on his arms was too much for him
hurled from his support he was slammed against the weather bulwarks and a moment later hauled out of the scuppers by the mexican
then personally con ducted to the hatch he was dropped be low
a a to four a scud of rain drove down on us and as i started for the companionway stubbs bounded out of it to the deck
captain golden was aroused at last and as i went below i heard him bawling to jibs
i would know what he came up the hands to get in the topsails and have given something handsome to the skipper had had in his mind when to me and asked if i was anything of a seaman
miss anstruther was in the cabin when i got below
this is our first storm isnot it mr lorry she asked bit of a blow miss anstruther i replied cheeringly helping us on into the trades and the quicker we strike the trades the quicker we get to fortune island
you refer to the tradewinds
yes
the captain has put the ship on her new course
we are now headed southwest i assured her
you didnot think he would refuse to take us to fortune island after his promise to me last evening did you
a a ter to four hardly know what i thought she answered musingly the more i see of captain golden the more my distrust of him increases shall watch him closely you may be sure of that said a wail came from the stateroom
poor mrs brackett is almost worried out of her senses said miss anstruther starting for the stateroom she thinks we may go to the bot tom any moment and insisted that i should find you and ask if there is any danger
tell her she may be a little uncomfortable for a while i smiled but that she is perfectly safe
we ate our dinner with the roughweather trays in place and i do not think miss an struther found it a very enjoyable meal
she ate but little and soon left the table with some bread and tea for mrs brackett
during the brief period she sat with the skip per and me her growing dislike of captain gold en was plainly manifested
she avoided his glances even when he asked her a question she kept her eyes away from him when she answered
a a to four that was the woman of it i supposed
as i did not want the skipper to feel that we distrusted him i resolved to speak to miss anstruther and give her a little good counsel at the first oppor tunity
vandeleur did not come to the cabin for his dinner
mr stubbs told me with a humorous grin that he hadnot the nerve to make the pas sage from the aft with the big sea run ning
the rest of that day was dreary enough
miss anstruther clung to her stateroom in constant attendance upon mrs brackett and i missed her sadly
i had another brief glimpse of her at supper when she resumed her same air of frigid reserve toward captain golden
the skipper was not a dense man and i knew that miss attitude did not escape him
was he sufficiently dense to misconstrue it
that was the point that bothered me
as i lay in my bunk that night with the lady may wallowing and plunging toward the heart of the great pacific i fell back on the usual pas time of my solitary waking hours
my mental carpentry had to do with dovetailing together cer i a a to four tain speculations in such a way as to make a tangible fabric of three dimensions
of course i gave it up
the materials with which i had to work were too vague for a lucid product
some agility was necessary to keep me in my berth
nevertheless i sleptby spells
the groaning timbers the stamp of feet overhead the shriek of the wind and the splash of the rain and the waves all united in a lullaby
several hours must have passed when a rough hand drummed on my door
i started up with a suddenness that brought my head in sharp con tact with the bottom of the upper berth
floundering to the door i pulled it open and found petie the cabinboy hanging to a chair in the cabin
what do you want
i demanded
mr vandeleur sent me sir answered petie
he wants to see you in the focsle
if he wants to see me i answered why doesnot he come here
he ainot able sir
he got stove in a little by a wave that boarded us this mornin
what time is it petie
a a to four four bells of the midwatch sir
i had not heard that vandeleur had been hurt by his mornings experience
yet i gave him the benefit of the doubt got into my clothes hur riedly took the skippers oilskin coat and sou wester from the cabin table where he had thrown them and climbed out into the howling gale
the rain had abated somewhat but the fierce wind drove the schooner at a racehorse clip through the inky seas
just from the lighted cabin as i was i could hardly see my hand before my face
where ye goin mr lorry called the mate from somewhere behind me
vandeleur wants to see me in the focsle
purty time this to turn out a man
mind yer eye as ye go forard sir a nasty sea running
i lurched down the lee steps from the poop sensed the windward roll by the feel of the deck and hustled forward along the lee rail
the roll from windward caught me close to the main rig ging
by then i could see a little and i jumped into the shrouds just as a huge wave foamed athwart i a a to ships with the slant of the deck
watching my chance i dropped to the dripping planks and started on again
forward of the galley with the hatch but a few yards away a stunning blow caught me from behind
i tried to cry out but every muscle went lax under the impact of the heavy hand that me
a sickening feeling of abject helplessness rushed through every nerve
for an instant the raging of wind and sea died away in blank si lence
then with a desperate dragging upon my re serve powers i regained my senses and felt that i was being propelled toward the side of the ship
who it was that had laid hold of me i could not see but i realized that my life was at stake and that if i saved myself i must fight
lifting my voice in a wild yell i struck out furiously with my clenched fists grappled with my unknown antagonist and we went to the deck and rolled over and over into the scuppers
there my head brought up with tremendous force against the bulwarks and once more everything tangible slipped from me
i cool villainy
when i regained my wits the mate had me up on the poop in the lee alley
there was keen pain at the back of my head and in my ears a dull roaring not of the wind or the sea
what did ye yell for mr lorry inquired stubbs helping me to my feet and supporting me as i leaned against the cabin man donot usually yell like that when a bit of a comber comes aboard and slams him head first into the bulwarks should say not
i agreed you see any one else when you picked me up mr stubbs
only the watch
i grappling with any one
because of the dark i felt rather than saw the mates amazement
a moment more and his words left no doubt of it
now keelhaul me he exclaimed thought i a a to four ye was too much of a sailor to git knocked off your pins
was ye set on was and from behind just forward of the galley
i left my mark on the man who did it that swear to
come forward with me mr stubbs until i can have a look at the watch better crawl into your bunk for now mr lorry counseled the mate halfafter two in the mornin an your investigation can wait going to settle this now i declared want to have a look at vandeleur as well as at the watch
my head in spite of its throbbing ache was as clear as a bell and i was as steady on my feet as ever
we gained the hatch without much difficulty and i descended leaving stubbs to send the watch down a man at a time
a chorus of snores reverberated in the focsle battling with the outer noise and with a thump of boots against the bulkhead as the vessel rolled and the slap and swish of oilskins
one of the swedes was the first to come down
his face bore no evidence of rough treatment
he had heard my yell he stated but he had seen a a ter to four no one forward aside from his watchmates
he had been dozing on the deckhouse under the lee of one of the boats
the mexican followed the swede told a similar story and bore no marks of a struggle
next came one of the americans a lowbrowed bull necked ruffian who i was sure would be capable of anything in a pinch
but he passed muster as easily as the other two
so much for the watch
taking the sealamp from its swinging frame i went from bunk to bunk examining the faces of the sleepers
these offered no evidence whatever
vandeleur was sleeping apparently as soundly as the rest
he did not seem in very bad case from his experi ence with the boarding wave
with one hand i shook him into wakefulness
well said i grimly as he lay staring up at me what do you want
jove he stuttered
what are you doing here
what do you want
you sent for me he mumbled and i saw fear in his weak face
a a ter to four well
i said between my teeth leaning down over him
out with it
mrs brackett has a bottle of arnica in her carpetbag with a futile readiness that brought a halfsmile to my lips and i wanted you to get it for me
why didnot you tell petie that when you sent him aft thought i did but i was in a good deal of pain and may have neglected to do so arnica in the medicinechest
why didnot you have petie go to captain golden didnot think of that he gulped
there are several things vandeleur that you didnot think about something however that you had best keep in mind from this on hereafter i shall carry a loaded revolver and if any one tries to slip me overboard therell be shooting
look sharp my lad
if you want to stay aboard the schooner youll have to do dif ferently
then i put the lamp back in the bracket climbed to the deck and went to the galley
sli ding the door i stepped into the narrow room
the cook slept in a cubbyhole off his kitchen and a a ter to a scratched match gave me a good view of his ebony face
no it wasnot the cook
when i regained the poop the mate inquired anxiously for the result of my investigation
i told him of my failure to find the man i was look ing for
he was strangely quiet for a minute his fin gers running up under his souwester and scra ping through his scant hair
if i was you mr lorry he remarked wouldnot give that vandeleur any more rope than necessary been stringin the crew with a lot o talk about treasure an the lord know what
mebby you knows how sailors is an meb by you donot but it ainot policy an is like to breed trouble betwixt ourselves an the main mast he added hastily
thank you mr stubbs said i grimly
from this on have two eyes for vandeleur
thereupon i lurched down the companionway and crawled back into bed
by the following morning the storm had blown itself out the wind had died down to a skippers breeze and the heavy sea was slowly subsiding
there was a lump at the back of my head and a a to four a bruise at the crown
the skin had been frayed from the knuckles of my right hand too and i was more certain than ever that i had left some mark on the man who had attacked me
every doubt vanished at breakfast
when captain golden appeared and took his seat there was a patch of courtplaster as large as a half dollar pasted over his left temple
my angle of vision had again changed
so deeply impressed was i by my discovery that i was more than taciturn to the others at table even to mrs brackett who had put in an appear ance with clearing weather
snapped by a ropesend explained the skip per resting the fingers of his mutilated hand on the patch of courtplaster
that was an un common wind we had he added and everythin loose was snapping for a while
there was a brief respite of silence
mr stubbs tells me you had a rough experi ence last night mr lorry continued the skip per his voice easy and noncommittal
nothing to speak of i answered with a quieting glance into miss apprehen sive face
a a to ur excusing myself i went on deck
so captain golden was the man who had laid for me forward of the galley
it seemed incredible that the skipper should descend to such cool villainy
and the cunning of it
for he had left his oilskins on the cabin table for tacit evidence that he was in his state why should he want to get rid of me
was i not the one from whom he was to receive his hire
there could be but one answer to the question that burned in my brain
golden and vandeleur had exchanged confidences and if appearances spoke rightly had gone into a conspiracy
with me out of the way the two rogues could have intimidated the two women and forced a confessionfrom mrs brackett at leastof the details of our mission which we were holding back
suppose i had been thrown over the rail in the soueaster
not a soul aboard save the two most nearly concerned in the plot would have known that it was not the result of accident
receiving a doubt of golden from logy bill a a to four at the last moment i was a fool for not breaking my contract losing the advancemoney and hir ing another ship
the forenoon watch was the captains
dur ing the afternoon watch which was the mates anstruther came on deck and joined me at a place where we could talk out of hearing of the man at the wheel
what was that rough experience you had last night mr lorry
miss anstruther asked
vandeleur sent for me at two oclock in the morning yy and you went
the cabinboy said he had been hurt and wanted to see me i continued with a trace of a smile wasnot expecting foul play you know but some one made an attack upon me from be hind and tried to throw me overboard
i saw the quick pallor rise in her face and her small hands grip the rail
miss anstruther i mur mured believe me i should not have told you this had captain golden not aroused your curi osity
you said mr lorry she returned leveling i a a to four her steady eyes at me that you would tell me everything
but such rough wor is one of the contingencies of this expedi tion she finished
did you find out who at tacked you she went on pushing straight for the nub of the difficulty left my mark on the fellow i answered showing my skinned knuckles
we rolled against the side of the ship and before i had a chance to find out who he was the blow from the bulwarks caused me to lose consciousness
but you could find the villainby your mark
she touched her hand against mine as it lay on the rail
did you look for him mr lorry did said scanned the watch with the mates help and i went into the and looked into the sleeping faces of the watch below
i also went to the galley and took the doctors measure
the man wasnot in the forecastle or the gal ley
her voice was intense and earnest
no
did you observe mr vandeleur particularly
a a ter to ur why he wouldnot have the strength or the courage for such an attempt miss anstruther
nevertheless i did observe him
did he send for you
and if so what was his excuse
i told her
then as her mind traveled swiftly along the various circumstantial links in the chain her pallor returned and a look of horror filled her face
captain golden she gasped and looked around fearfully as though halfexpecting to see the treacherous skipper
your reasoning miss anstruther said brings you to the same point which i reached this morning
you will worry more than ever now and that is why i did not want you to know
it is right that i should know she averred her lithe form straightening
you are the main stay of our venture mr lorry
vandeleur un derstands that and so does captain golden
this was their you and then take whatever part in our plans they chose
the mys tery the fact that we are going after a possible fortune has aroused cupidity and a a to four he has invoked the aid of the skipper
ah it is plain plain
and itit is fiendish
her eyes ranging forward to where vandeleur was sitting on the main hatch blazed angrily
hereafter she continued a resolute note in her voice you must go armed every minute
i tapped the sagging pocket of my coat
that suggested itself to me miss an struther
furthermore she pursued you must be wary and watchful
everything mr lorry everything depends upon you
i remained silent
events seemed to prove con clusively that i stood between mrs brackett and miss anstruther and trickery on the part of vandeleur and captain golden
do you think said miss anstruther as though by afterthought that captain golden notices my dislike
would he infer from that that you and i suspect him of underhand deal ings with us
and if he did draw such an in ference could it have had anything to do with your experience last night
she was a wondrously clearheaded girl
the a a to four more i talked with her the more my admiration was aroused by her perspicacity was going to speak with you about that miss anstruther i replied
really i think captain golden notices how you avoid him
cer tainly he could draw no inference from that to lead to the act of last night still if you could be a little more amiable it might be well
am i to act a lie mr lorry
the color crept into her face as she spoke would not call it that said i hastily
there is such a thing you know as being diplo matic
in a way mrs brackett and you and i are in captain power
this is his ship and the sailors recognize his authority
when afloat a masters authority is a fearsome thing for he is often a law unto himself
if captain golden thinks we distrust him he will do one of two things
either he will try to demean him self in such a way as to set our fears at rest or he will go his way and let us know that he does not care how we regard him
whichever thing he does i added slowly the knowledge that we suspect him will render him more cautious
he will be more careful to a a to hide his hand and hence will be all the more dan gerous
for several minutes miss anstruther was in a brown study
at last a smile not untinged with selfreproach wreathed about her sensitive lips have been very foolish she observed but i am a girl of pronounced opinions
when i dis like any one it is hard for me to dissemble
are you equally generous with those whom you like
what was that inscrutable light that flashed in her eyes
what would i not have given could i have interpreted it
the words had no sooner left my lips than i was angry at my presumption must go now she said ignoring my ques tion save for that one swift look see very clearly mr lorry that your wellbeing depends in a measure upon myself
please observe in the morning how good an actress i can beupon occasion
she would act a lie as she called it for the sole purpose of disarming the skipper in my be half
my emotions were conflicting as i watched her flit from sight through the companion
the uncharted isle
for a voyage begun under such exciting cir cumstances the days following my rough ex perience in the soueaster passed in an unex pected dearth of incident
i was at a loss to ac count for this except on the supposition that van deleur and captain golden were holding their ulterior designs in abeyance
miss anstruther was indeed an actress of no mean ability
whether at meals in the cabin or with captain golden on deck she so favored him with her wit and her conversational charm that the crafty seadog appeared fairly capti vated
the skipper began a stealthy and in some re spects ludicrous personal overhauling
for in stance we noticed one morning that the dingy green cotton shield which had covered his useless eye had been replaced with a diamond of yellow silk on another morning that he had polished the brasswork of his coat and sponged from the cloth a a to four certain traces of pea soup which had long been in evidence and again that his torpedo beard had been freshly though bunglingly trimmed
heaven knows what captain golden meant by this
the obvious conclusion was too annoying for me to consider
nor did miss anstruther pause here in the sacrifice she was making for vandeleur also was much in her company and to all appearances rather high in her good graces
i rebelled in wardly at this and perhaps something of jealousy was mixed up in it
nevertheless it was as good as a show to watch the antics of the skipper and vandeleur whenever miss anstruther appeared on deck and they were within hailing distance
both men would hasten toward her striving to see which should be first at her side and the smarting vexa tion of the one that lost the race always flew to the surface
at such times i have noticed the dancing mis chief in the girls hazel eyes and read the soft raillery in the demure lines of her face
natur ally there fell a growing coolness between gold en and vandeleur
a a to four between two such monopolists as these miss hours on deck were so completely taken up that mrs brackett and i had perforce to fall back on each others society for diversion
i will not say that i failed to enjoy the elderly ladys homely views on life in general and on our expedition in particular but nevertheless i was conscious of the waxing discontent deep down in my soul
nearly every day there were periods usually brief when miss anstruther and i met by our selves
sometimes these came to us in the cabin sometimes on deck and i began to observe a change in her manner as well as in her talk
there was a faraway look in her eyes an ex pression halfsad halfdetermined on her facewhen we were alone
for me too her conversa tion dealt in generalities and was burdened with constraint
after a while this line of conduct touched my pride
had my heart not been so intimately con cerned doubtless i should not have begun to avoid her as i did
vandeleur continued to sleep in the focsle but resumed his place at the first table in the cabin a a to four soon after miss anstruther began to notice him again
he had ever a cold eye for me and if he noticed me at all it was by a curt perfunctory nod
i wondered along toward the end of the out ward voyage if the rivalry and growing coolness between captain golden and vandeleur had any thing to do with the eventless days that trooped after the soueaster
was miss anstruther playing a womans part to draw the sting of their conspiracy
we picked up the steady trades about twenty five degrees north of the equator and went foam ing southeasterly night and day wing and wing our headsails blanketed by the spread of canvas aft
the ship wellnigh sailed herself and after her morning toiletalways punctilious and thor oughly attended tothe hands idled about in every available scrap of shade
the skipper got his timesight in the morning and at noon took the meridian altitude working out longitude and latitude together
i tried to be around while he pricked out course and dis tance on the chart
our daily average run in the trades was two a a to four hundred and fifty miles but we had lost a good deal of time in the light and variable airs off the coast
captain golden had marked a cross on the spot where our uncharted isle was supposed to lie and i noted with quickening pulse each days forward leap toward our destination
whenever i mentioned fortune island the captain vouchsafed me a sarcastic look out of his expressive eye sail over this island of yours he once told me an just to convince ye it isnot there heave the lead an get no bottom
this was merely talk
if he really thought there was no such island why had he and vande leur worked together at the beginning of the cruise
if the island was a myth conspiracy between the two would have been a waste of effort
the weather grew warmer and warmer as we bore southward dropped aboard and anderson got dolphins for us from the knightheads
this gave us a pleasant variation of our bill of fare
for some days i made it a practise to mingle with the crew during the dogwatches
my pre a a to four vious impression that the swedes anderson and larsen were the only trustworthy men forward was confirmed
eph the doctor was a morose individual and inclined to be quarrelsome
he talked but little and he had a way of avoiding a straightforward look that convinced me he was tricky petie the cabinboy was no better than a wharfrat with all a shortcomings
allison and minturn the american sailors had the faces and hangdog airs of a pair of beachcombers
the kanaka was of a gentler but more crafty type of deepsea criminal and garcia the mexican was no whit better
all hands regarded me as the walking personi fication of a profitable mystery
curiosity envy and hostility could be read in the covert glances cast in my direction
in all except the swedes this mixture of emotions was frankly brutal
my investigations forward were made at the time i was seeking to avoid miss anstruther
several times i had seen her alone on the poop looking a mute invitation for me to come aft
later i reproached myself for my churlishnesslater when i had discovered the cost to her
a arter to four on an evening when we were nearly four weeks out of san francisco i stood looking over the rail watching a phosphorescent glow turn the schooners wake into a pathway of gold
it was the mates watch but i did not know where he was
the man at the wheel was nod ding and the watch probably asleep on the focslehead
the strong breeze which had not failed us for days had dropped to a light wind but still came directly over our taffrail
i was thinking as usual of our strange voyage and speculating upon the mystery to be revealed at the end of it
suddenly i became aware that some one was standing near me likewise peering over the rail into the goldentipped waves
miss anstruther
i exclaimed
yes mr lorry she answered resting her chin on her hand and gazing at me through the semigloom have been wanting to talk with you for some time but you are so preoccupiedshall i say days that it has been difficult to find the opportunity
your own time has been pretty well taken up miss anstruther i countered and for a long a a to four time mrs brackett saw so much of me that i was afraid she had begun to tire of my company
and so you went forward to make a study of the crew
do the men bear close inspection
we were far enough from the wheel to be out of earshot of the helmsman and i could see no one else in our near vicinity
two of them anderson and larsen will bear close inspection said but the rest are rather too much like captain golden
with her chin in her hands she looked off over the heaving sea fancy she murmured that you are vexed with me
perhaps and there was a trace of levity in her voice you find me too good an actress
i did not reply
a moment of silence and then she continued nothing has happenedto you i mean since your rough experience during the south easter would rather have faced treachery every day from captain golden and vandeleur i burst out my surging discontent finding its way to my lips rather thanthan a a to four i paused lamely realizing that my heart was carrying me too far
she withdrew her eyes from seaward and for a few moments peered into my face intently
when she finally spoke it was with a throbbing undernote that set every nerve in my body to tingling
do not misconstrue what i have done mr lorry
you cannot know what it has cost me to follow your advice or how i have reproached myself for my conduct even while i acknowl edged the sordid wisdom of it
yet if it has safe guarded you in any way my sacrifice of a life long principle has not been entirely in vain
there was a sad little quiver in the final words
one of her hands had dropped to the rail and lay there whitely
by a quick impulse i dropped my roughened palm over the hand and the next instant my love for the girl would have been de clared
quickly however she withdrew her hand with a rigid straightening of her body
captain golden she whispered
the odor of the skippers everlasting stogy was blowing back to us
he lounged toward us a a to carelessly with some remark concerning the fail ing wind and miss anstruther bade me a quick good night and went below
an hour or two later i followed her lighter of heart than i had been at any time since the be ginning of the voyage
miss anstruther had virtually admitted that all she had done had been for me
from my dreams that night i was awakened in the small hours by a pounding on my state room door
recalling another time when i had received a similar summons i answered the call warily
this time it was the skipper who stood outside and not the cabinboy
what is the matter captain golden
i asked
matter enough he cried
your con founded island is right under our forefoot and we shall be on a lee shore in less than a brace of shakes unless a miracle happens
a mess of rocks thats what your island is you hear the surf
i did hear it and it was booming dangerously near
we must have made a phenomenal run since a a to four noon i commented
it is impossible that we should be near the place
you must have been off a little in your reckoning your island thats off its reckoning he fumed
but the lookout he swore roundly
the lookout was asleep and here we are drifting in there room enough to wear
room but not wind enough a dead set toward the island and its impossible to claw off
tell the women to get ready for whatever happens an then come on deck
he whirled and rushed away while i began scrambling into my clothes
a close call
as i hurried from my stateroom i met miss anstruther in the cabin
she had dressed even more quickly than i had done
i began to tell her what had happened heard everything that captain golden said she interrupted calmly
if you want mrs brackett and me for anything mr lorry you will find us ready and waiting
i stared filled with admiration for her cool ness and courage a brave girl i said as i flung on ward up the companion stairs
when i saw the vast shadowy bulk of the island in the dim distance the inexcusable na ture of the skippers blunder was borne in upon me
he had had the deck when we came to such dangerous quarters with the uncharted coast and even though the lookout were asleep the skip per himself should have been on the alert
he had made a mistake in his reckoningof a a to ur that i was tolerably sure
perhaps too at the critical moment he had been steeped in one of those reveries of his and had not awakened to the peril of the ship until too late
the schooner had been brought by the wind on the best tack to haul offshore and captain golden was anxiously watching the effect of our change of course
but the move would not serve
the current was dragging us three feet toward the reef for every foot that the light wind helped us away from it
all hands were on deck silently waiting for orders
the mate was in the chains watching the casts of the lead
no bottom was his con tinual call
our only hope just then seemed to lie in finding holdingground for our anchors
off soundings was the despairing comment of the skipper
might as well try to run out a line to chiny as to anchor here
but if the boats were in the water he whirled on me with an oath reminded me that i was a passenger that my devilish cruise was like to cost him enough and would i put a stopper on my jawtackle before he knocked me overboard
he had asked me to come on deck a arter to four and in any other circumstances he would probably have won a retort in kind
as it was i held my peace and stared at the smother of foam white in the moonlight toward which we were rapidly drifting
yet he was right about the boats
the current was uncontrollable and they would have been useless
reefs of the pacific particularly coral reefs are usually steepto on their seaward side so that only a jump takes a ship from off soundings right into the breakers
at that moment i wouldnot have given a copper cent for the lady chances
quite naturally my thoughts of probable dis aster brought mrs brackett and miss anstruther vividly before my mind
the skipper would have none of my advice as to the management of his ship and so far as the ship was concerned he was welcome to the exercise of his own judgment good bad or indifferent but in the present in stance bound up with the fate of the schooner were my life and the lives of the two ladies
i had a suggestion to make as helpless ness became more and more apparent
16o a a to four with your permission captain said and the help of a couple of hands take the dory from the stern davits pull to leeward and try the soundings a slim chance i know but if we donot find holdingground somewhere be tween here and the reef well be stove in in less than half an hour
i could see his one eye glimmer balefully in the dusk consequently his answer was a surprise
go ahead he growled if it will be any sat isfaction to you
give me anderson and larsen said he called the two men aft gave them their orders and the dory was got into the water
in less than five minutes we were foaming to lee ward the swedes bending to their oars while i stood in the sternsheets and made frequent casts with the handlead
i had already made up my mind that the island was not of coral formationit bulked too large against the moonlit sky for that
more likely it was of volcanic origin and i had hopes of get ting bottom at some point nearer the outlying reef
i was presently able to see as well as to hear a a to four the long formidable groundswells as they broke over the rocks and churned the space beyond into seething white
as i surveyed the creaming ridge and the cur rent sucked us steadily toward it i noticed what looked like a belt of smooth water piercing the line of breakers
we were perhaps forty fathoms away and i swerved the dory to a course that would lay it well into the smooth belt hoping in my soul that it might prove a swashway leading to safe anchorage beyond
my surmise was correct
i got bottom at ten fathoms in the swashway and beyond in com paratively quiet waters at eight fathoms
this was infinitely more than i had dared to hope for
the dory was put about and we fought our way back through the passage
the ship was still steering by the wind and still setting in toward the reef at frightful speed
ahoy the schooner
i called
well came hoarse response
have you steerageway captain golden
just about
then follow the dory if you can and have everything in readiness to anchor
a a to four do you know what youre doin lorry shouted the skipper
mind ye donot make a bad matter worse
a tart reply was on my tongue but i smoth ered it back
for a short space i was in doubt whether golden would adopt my suggestion then with a feeling of relief i heard him order the helm up
slowly the schooners bows fell off then she began forging ahead with speed increasing by degrees
i kept the dory far enough to wind ward to give the schooner plenty of room then at the right moment we darted into the passage
threading that swashway was ticklish business for the lady may but i kept the dory in the lead of her sounding as we went
a few minutes took us beyond the reef and a few minutes later the schooner followed
standing in the sternsheets i watched until the lady may had gained the proper position when i shouted for golden to anchor
the roar of the breakers prevented me from hearing much of what took place on the schooner but i saw her wear smartly with her headsails and foresail coming down
the main boom was a a to hauled amidships as she came into the wind and then the welcome splash of the anchor shivered through the boom of the surf
the schooner took her scope of cable freely and was finally brought up
i drew a deep breath and told the men to lay the dory alongside think the old man can thank you for saving the ship sir said anderson
larsen agreed with his mate and the tones of both it struck me carried more respect than an able seaman ever feels for a landsman
the schooner has a safe enough berth for the present my lads i answered but it will be well to hunt a safer one in the morning
we should have trouble in plenty if our cable were to chafe off on sharp rocks at the bottom
as i came over the schooners side the skip pers greeting was characteristic
damned lucky i thought o havin ye go off in the boat an try for soundings said he the only thing under heaven that saved the old hooker
i let it go at that and went below
mrs brack ett sat in one of the cabin chairs wringing her a a to four hands
miss anstruther stood beside her try ing to be of comfort the ship been wrecked mr lor ry asked mrs brackett lifting her distressed face to mine
are we all goin to the bottom
no indeed mrs brackett i answered cheerily the schooner is safe at anchor and were a good eight fathoms from the bottom
thank goodness
mrs brackett straight ened up and her face cleared had zelda lookin all around for a corkbelt or whatever it is they use when theres a shipwreck
this is the island weve come to find is it
undoubtedly declare glad of that even if it did come near bein the end of us
you and miss anstruther had better go back to bed now i advised and get all the rest you can be work for us ashore tomor row
mrs brackett got up and tottered toward her stateroom
miss anstruther lingered to say and it was you who saved us mr lorry petie told me that much then gave me a daz a a ter to four zling smile before she turned to follow mrs brackett
next morning i heard excited voices on deck and hurried up to investigate
our cable hadnot partedthat much was evidentand i was at a loss to account for the commotion
golden stubbs and vandeleur were gathered in a group by the starboard rail surveying some object through a glass
this object i could see with my naked eye was the hull of a wrecked and dismasted boat broken across the reef and with her stern just awash
some other fellow blundered in here in the dark i reckon observed captain golden care fully studying the wreck through the glass is the first letter an the next is now wait till she rolls again
ah ah
there his hand fell to his side and his one eye ranged amazedly from the mate to me and from me to vandeleur
holy mackerel
why thats the old gazelle o frisco
vandeleur gave a jump and uttered an astounded exclamation
the next moment he turned slowly around and stared at me
an enemy unmasks wouldnot give the fagend nothin as the man says pursued captain golden again sizing up the wreck for chances when his brigantine hit that bunch o rocks
gene never crossed my hawse but once but that was enough
i never see such a misbemannered sou mixture o bear bufflo bandi coot an crockydile
now that jones has pulled him under though i reckon well not think of anythin but the good he had in him even if it does take a mikerscope to find it
that wreck got anythin to do with your business here lorry
perhaps it has and perhaps it hasnot i an swered
as a matter of fact i did not know my self although the skipper considered my reply evasive not of a pryin disposition lorry went on the skipper with a snap of the jaws but your expectations is goin to be knocked flat aback if ye donot make up your mind to be a little more a a ter to four confidin
i reckon thats all
while we take a pasear below mr stubbs an hit up the chow youd better get out one of the boats an look for a better anchorage
before following the skipper to the cabin i gave the island a critical survey
it looked bleak enough from seawarda sandy beach bordered with a broken jumble of rocks and back of the rocks a steep cliff fifty feet in the sheer
as far as i could see there was not a patch of green anywhere
yet certainly this was fortune island
the wreck of the gazelle bore vague but substantial testimony to that
mrs brackett and miss anstruther were vastly interested when informed of the wreck
the former came near to saying something that trenched directly on our mission but miss an struther gave her a look that brought her to her golden noticed the elderly ladys halfslip and the glance that had corrected it
his eye glim mered vindictively although he said nothing
there was a change in the skippers treatment of miss anstruther for he was now brusk to the a arter to four verge of insolence
had he been skulking about the deck the evening before i pondered and overheard some of the talk between miss an struther and myself
whether or no this was the case yet the skip pers attitude toward the girl started my temper
a short step farther and we should fall afoul of each other
the mates explorations in the boat were highly successful
he reported a sheltered cove with good holdingground a beach of sand and gravel easy for landing andbest of alla safe passage to leeward when we were ready for sea fortune island lay under the northeast trades and to work out of the swashway against wind and current would have been a difficult proposi tion
an accessible cove with a passage to lee ward however tided us over this difficulty
mrs brackett and miss anstruther were for being rowed ashore at once
if the doctor will put us up a lunch said i to captain golden land and spend the day on the island shouldnot like anything better answered a a to four the skipper than to stretch my legs on the beach
an i donot suppose vandeleur will object to a day ashore either
the ladies and i will spend the day on the island alone i observed bluntly and brought golden up with a round turn
for the work we are going to do we wish to have the island to ourselves and even vandeleur is barred
well sink me
the skipper drew back and took my sizing ironically
you donot have any idea now he drawled that you own every un charted turtleback in the two oceans have a very clear idea i frowned that i am paying you good money to obey orders
you will set mrs brackett miss anstruther and me ashore this morning and call for us late in the afternoon
with that i whirled on my heel and went to collect some traps which we were to take with us
the impedimenta consisted of a hundred feet of stout rope some candles and matches tightly wrapped in a waterproof covering my two re volvers with a good supply of cartridges and the shortbladed machete
the doctor had the hamper of food ready a a to four when i came on deck and the ladies were wait ing
the dory was alongside manned by alli son and minturn with captain golden in the sternsheets
vandeleur had drawn miss an struther apart and was protesting wrathfully against being left behind can do nothing mr vandeleur i heard the girl say
mr lorry has entire charge and you and the rest of us must do exactly as he thinks best
your interests will not suffer in any way i can promise you that
the sailors watched curiously while i threw my traps into the boat and while i was helping the ladies over the side and golden was assisting them below
vandeleur rushed up to me and shook a puny fist in my face
by jove he cried if you donot act square with me youll wish you had make a show of yourself before the men i counseled in a low tone
and you may rest assured vandeleur that we will deal squarely with youin spite of your trickery and crookedness
thereupon i gained the boat and we pushed off vandeleur looking over the side and glaring a a ter to four at me until we vanished into a narrow high walled passage that led to the cove
the mate at the time was making ready to warp the schooner to her safer anchorage
the passage between the rocks was about ten fathoms wide and thirty long
traversing this we came out into a little lagoon sheltered on all sides by high bluffs with the leeward channel mentioned by the mate opening off at the farther end
in this small but perfect haven the roar of the surf was so deadened that we could hear the whisper of waves on the shingle
an ancient volcanic upheaval had split away the northern segment of the island forming the lagoon and leaving the two channels to east and west
on our right was a clifflike wall and on our left was a smooth sloping beach leading up ward to a barren rift in the rocks
the kelpfringed shore gave off a salty re freshing odor and i noticed a rill of water flow ing into the lagoon by a devious course appar ently coming out of the cleft above the beach
but there were no trees no verdure nothing but scoriated rocks as far as the eye could reach
yet the smooth still water the lap of waves on the a a to four gravel the grateful smell of the seaweed the heattempering touch of the tradewind and the prospect of an easy landing with a thrilling mys tery near solution brought happiness to miss hazel eyes and a look of compla cency to mrs face
the one jarring note was the skipper
he was taciturn wore a black scowl and his single eye flashed with ominous portent
i imagined that he had not yet recovered from my show of au thority
we got the boat to the beach and i assisted the ladies to land
i had thrust the revolvers through my belt and after allison had thrown out the coil of rope the parcel wrapped in oil skin and the machete captain golden sprang out on the sand and faced me squarely word with you said he savagely
as the man says one or the other o us has got to toe the mark an its high time we settled which
mrs brackett and miss anstruther drew closer together the latter setting down the ham per which she had brought from the boat and both regarding the skipper with distrust and fore boding
a a to four supposed said i easily that we had set tled that point when we signed our contract
what happens afloat an what happens ashore barked golden is two different things
your money pays for the lady may an when yere aboard her yere cock o the walk
on solid ground however yere no more to me than a castaway an your representative on the schooner is vandeleur
he grinned fiendishly over the quip
vandeleur is my guest i parried sharply and not my representative
in which case as captain to do as i see fit
you are to anchor the schooner in this cove subject to my orders said i sternly
anythin ye tell me on shore goes into one ear an out the other he snarled
lord it as ye please on deck but flourished a doubled fist in my face probably taking his pat tern from me any o your lip an stave in your headlights
i turned to the ladies
miss anstruther i requested please take mrs brackett and go up to that arroyo yonder
two the page a a to four as i spoke i pointed to the cleft in the hills above the beach
no she objected firmly we will stay right here
captain and here she turned appealingly toward golden surely you understand that you are as much under mr authority while we are on the island as you are while we are on the ship none o your putin he growled ducking his head toward the girl you any way like to know
helpin lorry hey
playin off me an vandeleur against each other with that glibgabbed tongue o yours i suffered him to get that far but flesh and blood could stand no more
i let him have the weight of my fist on the point of his heavy lower jaw and he sprawled backward flat on the sand with heels in the air
allison and minturn started toward me but i whipped out one of the revolvers and they dropped back
avast you two
i cried sharply
help the skipper into the boat and pull back to the schooner the word my lads
captain golden lay heaving on the beach like a a a to four gudgeon that has been overlong out of the water
he was stunned and bewildered almost uncon scious
the sailors lifted him into the boat pushed off tumbled aboard themselves and fell to with the oars
i put the coil of rope over my shoulder picked up the oilskin parcel the machete and the hamper and started up the slope of the beach
come miss anstruther said bring mrs brackett and let us go about our work shouldnot have done that mr lor ry murmured the girl a mist of tears in her eyes as she looked after the retreating boat
he pushed me beyond endurance i answered shortly know but it wasnot policy
there are times miss anstruther when it is a mans part to throw policy to the winds
that was one of the times
then i marched on up the slope my compan ions following slowly and talking excitedly as they came
a gruesome fend
miss anstruther was right
laying violent hands on the skipper at that stage of our under taking was far from being good policy
yet given the same excuse i should have repeated the lesson and defied the consequences
i couldnot understand what had come over the man
i knew he was fond of his bottle and i had been told that he went to excess with it when in port or when laid up elsewhere so the schooner could spare him and i could only imagine that he had taken a drop too much that morning
it was a bad beginning for our work on the island and i felt sure my companions would be depressed by it
at the opening of the cleft through the hills i paused and waited for the ladies to come up with me
as they were coming slowly i had time to lay down the stuff i was carrying and climb to the highest bank
from that elevated point i obtained a good view of the entire island
it was small and lit a a to tle more than the top of a submarine mountain pushed above the surface of the sea
in shape the island was an irregular circle higher toward the west and diminishing in a series of steps toward the east
its whole ex tent was crossed and recrossed with rocky and dismally barren ridges
following the angling cleft with my eyes i observed farther eastward a thin strip of green grass bordering the brook
this was all the herbage i could see
there was a bend in the cleft however just beyond the grass and what lay farther on could only be ascertained by investigation
slipping down the sterile hillside i rejoined my compan ions
did you see our promised land from up there mr lorry asked miss anstruther seeking bravely to hide the perturbation aroused by the affair on the beach
it is a very barren land i smiled so far as tropical islands go
still we did not come here hunting breadfruit and coconuts so we have no cause to feel discouraged
the most promising a a to four thing on the island is this valley and we will fol low the brook
before picking up my burdens i knelt and took a drink of the water
it was deliciously cool and sweet
opening the hamper i took out a tin cup and filled it for mrs brackett
mrs brackett was not so successful at hiding her feelings as was miss anstruther and she continued to be very nervous and excited
never theless between us miss anstruther and i suc ceeded in calming her fears
a hundred yards brought us to the narrow carpet of grass and another hundred yards took us around the turn in the valley
here we made a discovery indeed for we came upon a small hut evidently built of materials from the wreck of the gazelle house cried mrs brackett then impelled by a wild but pathetic impulse she hurried for ward calling tom
tom
miss anstruther and lingering behind for a moment exchanged sad glances isnot possible there is any one here is it mr lorry the girl asked thinking no doubt of the possibility of finding her brother
a a to four i shook my head
if we found any one here it would probably be some one from the wreck of the gazelle said and you may be sure that if there were any castaways on the island they would long since have made themselves known to us
i noted the hut wonderingly as we approached
it was sided with sandalwood strips and roofed with a couple of hatchcovers rotten tarpaulins filling out the space between the walls
a section of cabin skylight served for a window and the door had evidently once closed the entrance to a stateroom
a stovepipe projected from the roof
the hut contained but a single room and there were four berths arranged against the walls in two tiers
the floor was of sand and a table stood in the center of it with four chairs placed one at each side in orderly fashion
at one end of the room was a galley stove
not far from the stove was a boxcupboard swung against the wall
neatly piled in the cup board were four tin plates four tin cups four spoons four knives and forks
in a corner close to the cupboard was a pile of tinned meat and vegetables also a bag of a a to four moldy ships bread overturned and spilling out on the floor
there were blankets in the bunks and a smoky smell about the interior of the hut that suggested human habitation
miss anstruther and i stood just within the door while we made our survey
mrs brackett her wild hopes disappointed leaned dispiritedly against the table
tom ainot here she said dully there ainot any one here
you didnot really expect to find your son did you mrs brackett
i asked gently
why not she burst out
why shouldnot i expect to find tom i want to know you think he had anything to do with sending us here mr lorry
who sent us here is still a mystery as well as why we were sent here
the teakwood cases began miss an struther and paused
the ten teakwood cases i finished we shall doubtless find in the seacavern
what they contain will probably be our sole reward for com ing here
apart from thatand even that is suppositionwe know nothing
a a to ur all the furnishings of the hut suggested miss anstruther seem to be made up of groups of four
plainly she deduced with a specula tive air there were four survivors of the wreck of the gazelle
and i would hazard the opinion i added that those four were captain eugene trent archibald anstruther thomas brackett and ar thur mayhew
if my boy was here demanded mrs brack ett her reason obscured by hope and anxiety then why ainot he here now
perhaps they were all taken away by a ship said miss anstruther
if he was taken away by a ship hed have come home to me persisted mrs brackett
no she went on after a moment her voice quivering with conviction if tom was here then hes here nowand goin to find him
the poor woman for whose grief and despair miss anstruther and i had nothing but deepest compassion left the hut and started along a faint path that led onward down the slope of the bleak valley
miss anstruther and i followed her
a pile of broken and splintered wreckage lay a a to four back of the hut and seemingly had furnished the castaways with firewood
not far from the wreckage the ground was littered with empty meat and vegetable tins
the castaways whoever they were i ven tured must have remained on the island for some time
this pathway is well worn and is still easily followed although months must have passed since it was last used
miss anstruther did not answer
her head was bowed in pensive thought
mrs brackett was not the only one to be grievously disap pointed
the girl i knew had entertained hopes of finding her brother somewhere along that trail of mystery
the path ended at a spring which bubbled out of the rocks dropped into a pool and then trick led away down the valley
mrs brackett had kept on and vanished from sight around another turn that lay ahead of us
miss anstruther and i followed suddenly ac celerating our pace when a plaintive griefstrick en cry smote upon our ears from the distance
wondering and fearful we hastened around a a a to four projecting spur of rocks and found mrs brackett upon her knees beside an oblong mound
there were four of the mounds for the sig nificant grouping of fours was carried out even here
at each mound was a headboard neatly squared and neatly lettered
each character in the several inscriptions had been painstakingly carved in the wood
the legend on the headboard of the first grave where mrs brackett was kneeling read thus sacred to the memory of thomas brackett who died of injuries received during the wreck of the gazelle
miss anstruther and i read the inscription and passed slowly on to the next grave
here the inscription was identically the same except that the board bore the name of archibald an struther
the girl leaned against the head board and buried her face in her hands
i went on to the next mound
under that lay captain eugene trent who had likewise met his end through the wrecking of his illfated brigantine
there was no one to mourn for captain trent
even had vandeleur been there there would have a a to been no sorrowing over the grave of the dead skipper
the next mound i felt sure would hide one of my own kin
but in this i was mistaken
the headboard marked the final restingplace of three sailors whose bodies had been washed ashore
i stood beside that last grave and pondered
what had become of my cousin arthur may hew it must have been he who had laid away the others and had erected the headboards with their inscriptions
naturally there would have been mo one left to perform the last sad rites when his turn came
why had we not found his remains in the hut
surely there if anywhere his end would have overtaken him
then came another thought had not the same hand that had laid away these men and so carefully commemorated their last restingplaces been the one to send those four cards their sev eral ways
if such was the case then arthur mayhew a a to must still be among the living
yet if so why was he not there in person
why had he quar tered that card of instructions
above all why was he not claiming his share of the contents supposed to be in the ten teakwood cases
the words are sometimes inadequate to express our truest feelings
i find them so in trying to do full justice to zelda courage and helpfulness at this dark period of our fortunes
our gruesome discovery shocked us into reali zation of the vanities of earthly aims and ambi tions
i needed the lesson and profited by it
of late my mind had been growing more and more sordid in dealing with the outcome of our expedition
there were fortunes to be had at the rainbows end and the thought of mere gain is always brutalizing
the sight of those two women in tears touched and softened me
if our enterprise accomplished nothing more than a knowledge of the fate of a son and a brother even yet it was worth the price we had paid in money and hardship
in a little while miss anstruther came to my side
she was her calm brave self again and suggested that we get mrs brackett back to the a a to four hut
miss anstruther thought that she could minister to the poor woman and stem the torrent of her grief with more success if she were re moved from that heartbreaking spot
i silently acquiesced and we supported mrs brackett to the spring and back along the path to the cabin
an hour later when the distraught woman began to gain some control over herself we had luncheon
after luncheon i picked up my coil of rope my oilskin parcel and my machete excused myself for a time and started for the door
where are you going mr lorry asked miss anstruther
to investigate the seacavern
she looked worried
must you do that today
i hate to have you go alone and yet i feel as though she finished with a significant glance at the bowed head of our companion
we are in such a state of uncertainty with regard to captain golden i answered that i feel as though we should be no longer about our work than is absolutely necessary
what i am a art to four going to do now i can do best alone
will you remain here until i come back
she looked at me steadily for a moment
yes she replied
i hesitated for a space then drew one of my revolvers from my belt and laid it on the table
so far as i can see i went on there is not the least reason in the world why you should need that but nevertheless i am going to leave it
perhaps you will feel safer
she thanked me with a glance and i went on out of the cabin and started eastward along the valley
at the spur beyond the spring i looked back
miss anstruther stood in the doorway watch ing me
she started suddenly to withdraw as i turned but paused and waved her hand encour agingly
i lifted my hat to her then faced about and strode onward
passing the headboards which stood as so many mute details of the greater mystery i ha stened my steps and came finally to a place where the valley angled sharply to the south and to the sea
climbing the eastern slope of the angle i to a flat crest whose wall dropped sheer a a to four downward to the breakers
somewhere in that wall should be the entrance to the seacavern
this the easternmost scrap of the island measured no more than five hundred feet across
the average drop to sealevel from the brow of the cliff i judged to be about fifty feet
to locate the mouth of the cavern properly a boat should have been used with two stout oars men like the swedes
for me a boat was mani festly out of the question inasmuch as the use of one would have given every man in the schooner an inkling of our business
later it might be a boat would have to be used but not until i had investigated the cavern and mapped out a suitable course of procedure
just now my business was to find the opening into the wall
looking downward the wall itself gave no suggestion of a breach
but what the wall failed to tell the breaking waves made manifest
there was one spot directly below a point mid way across the top of the cliff where the waves did not break against the rocks
there was no spray supposably because the waves found no obstruction to break against
in other words the ioo a a ter to ur seas rushed unimpeded into the mouth of the cav lying flat down on the top of the cliff i let my eyes rove searchingly across the face of the wall
a shelflike ledge jutted out from the rocks above the turmoil of the waves although well within reach of the spindrift
the shelf could not be more than two feet across at the widest and scarcely more than six feet in length
it offered foothold however and a point of vantage for further discoveries
rising to my feet i looked around me and to the westward where the schooner was anchored
the rising rocks in that direction hid the ship entirely
i was alone and unwatched and could proceed with my work
my first move was to make the end of the rope fast to a boulder which lay on the brink and al most over the shelf
in order to keep the rope from chafing against the sharp edges of the boul der i padded it with my coat on the side that was to receive the brunt of the pull
also i cush ioned the angle over which the rope turned down ward with my hat
then i stripped off my shoes and shirt tied a a to the oilskin packet to the back of my belt with my cotton handkerchief slipped the machete into the front of the belt near the revolver and lowered myself over the brink
used to ropework as i was the downward climb was not difficult
i was pleased to note too that my old wound did not bother me
a few minutes brought me to the shelf and to my intense satisfaction i found that the shelf hung directly alongside the mouth of the cavern
so far everything had gone swimmingly and i was not long in discovering that the rest of my work would have to go swimmingly if i wanted to get inside the cavern
from my limited base of operations i gath ered that the opening into the cliff was perhaps forty feet across with its top a dozen feet above the smooth water
pulling off my stockings and weighting them down on the ledge with the ma chete and the revolver i tied a bowline knot in the end of the rope pushed the rope through the loop and drew the bight taut around my body under the arms
possibly i had thirty feet of leeway before i should take up all the slack of my lifeline
this a a to four i hoped would be enough to land me on the sub terranean beach of the cavern
with a final look upward to make sure that all was right i slipped from the ledge and was im mediately sucked into the black maw of the cav ern with dizzying swiftness
so fierce was the inset of the waves that the current itself upbore me with very little swimming
when i brought up at the end of the rope it was with a jar that almost dislocated my neck
for a few moments i bobbed up and down like a hooked fish the spray from the broken current nearly smothering me
then i began swimming in good earnest de scribing an arc about the bend of the rope at the cavernmouth
i was thirty feet from daylight and the darkness was so intense that i could not see my hand before my eyes
i swam into a wall to my left but it was an overhanging wall with the bottom of it worn away by action of the water
i sounded ho ping to touch bottom but failed in my expecta tions and propelled myself to the surface again
presently i struck out for the opposite side of the cavern and there my feet grounded in sand a a to four and i groped my dripping way up a slope through thick darkness
as soon as i found myself clear of the water i sank down to rest and recover breath before continuing farther
in five minutes i had taken my matches and candles from their waterproof covering and had struck a light
the candles gleams fought ifeebly with the opaque gloom
nothing short of a powerful arclight could have given me an in stantaneous and comprehensive view of my situa tion
stygian waves rolling out of a wall of shadow broke over the sand at my feet
an impenetrable curtain seemed to surround and shut me in over head and on all sides
the hollow roar of the surf echoed and rever berated thunderously between the rocky walls
walking up the gloomy beach i gained the wall at ten paces
keeping close to the perpendicular rocks i traversed an irregular halfcircle before i again found my way barred by the breaking surf
i had skirted the confines of the underground beach and had reached the overhanging wall i page a a ter to four which had defied me just within the caverns mouth
turning back i retraced my course at a dis tance of some two yards from the wall
not more than fifty paces from the turningpoint i stumbled against something
i stooped and swept the candlelight over the object
a box
one of the teakwood cases
as though under violent compression the breath rushed from my lungs and seemed to carry every ounce of my strength with it
i sank down on the box and the candle shivered in my hand
we had found the island the uncharted island lying where our mysterious instructions had placed it
i had found the cavern situated at the islands eastern extremity and here in the cav ern i had come upon the teakwood cases
as step by step we had followed our strange clue i could look back and see that my confidence in the final result had waxed stronger and stronger as we proceeded
i had expected to find the teakwood cases so i was at a loss to account for that sudden rush of weakness when i did find them
there were fortunes in those ten boxes
what a a ter to four the treasure consisted of i did not know yet i could have staked my life that an equal division of it meant fortunes for four of us
but were there ten boxes
my conviction in this regard was as firm as in every other never theless i sprang up on the instant and investi gated
yes there were ten cases in five piles of two each
i tried to push one of the upper boxes with my free hand
it resisted the push like so much solid iron
setting down the candle i took both hands to the box
i lifted it barely
the weight i placed roughly at one hundred and fifty pounds
spurred by feverish curiosity i hunted for a stone intent on breaking open one of the boxes to see what it contained
i found the stone but the strong black wood resisted my efforts
each box was strongly made and crossed four times with bands of strapiron
only a cold chisel and hammer could have forced one of the it was useless for me to remain in the cavern any longer
i had found out all that i could and had made assurance doubly sure
the next step a a to our was to consult with miss anstruther and devise ways and means for getting the treasure aboard the lady may and safeguarding it against a venomous skipper a treacherous companion and a piratical crew
this was a task to call for all our tact shrewdness and courage
with a final look at the black cases shimmer ing like ebony under the candles light i went back to the place where i had left the end of my lifeline anchored to a stone
the line was there
whether it was high tide in the cavern or not i did not know but i care fully stowed my reserve supply of candles and matches high up in a niche of the rocky wall
the halfconsumed candle i planted upright in the sand and left burning
i could watch it as a beacon while my way along the rope and against the current
placing the loop over my head i dropped it to my armpits and pulled it tight then i threw my self into the water and began drawing at the rope
it yielded so readily to the pull that i mar veled at the amount of slack lying between me and the mouth of the cavern
from marveling my mind leaped to doubt from a a ter to doubt to fear and from fear to the horror of a supreme conviction
the other end of the rope had been cast from its fastening at the brink of the cliff
staggering ashore with the limp rope in my hands i sprawled backward at full length on the sands my stony eyes on the mocking flicker of the candle
the jaws of death
all that the loosening of the rope signified did not appear at once
as my power to reason re turned the vista of probabilities opened with a plausible deadliness that took my breath
i had protected the cliff end of the rope so well that i knew it had not chafed apart
neverthe less i hauled it in foot by foot until i had the end in my hands and could examine it
the wide loop was just as i had tied it
it had been lifted bodily over the top of the boulder and cast from the cliff
with this to start from my line of probabili ties developed
i had been watched when i made the descent to the cavern and some oneit may have been captain golden or it may have been hoped to make an end of me by displacing the rope
we were back again to the situation as it stood on the lady may at the time of the noreaster
by eliminating me golden and vandeleur could a a to four work their will with the treasure and mrs brackett and miss anstruther would be power less to interfere
but there was more to the present situation than that
i had been seen going into the cavern and this would point our enemies indubitably to the heart of our mission
captain golden and vandeleur would come to that seacubicle by boat
should i remain there unarmed as i was and allow them to kill me out of hand
there was too much for me to live for
i thought of zelda anstruther and then again of the teakwood boxes
if i lived i might yet be able to protect mrs and miss interests no less than my own
but in order to live i must not be caught in that cavern like a rat in a trap
some thought of secreting the cases occurred to me but they were too large too heavy and the cavern offered no opportunities for secret stowing
i might have rolled them into the water but not knowing what their contents were feared to take the risk
no i would leave the cases where they were a a to four and struggle to get away from the cavern
and just here the enormity of the task unfolded itself
i should have to battle with the current if i breasted it successfully there was the pounding of the waves against the outer wall to be en dured resisting that i had still the shelf to gain and finally there were fifty feet of sheer cliff between the shelf and safety
as for the current i was a strong swimmer and my strength might even withstand the buf feting against the outside rocks
so far as re gaining the shelf was concerned i observed that the tide was rising and that it was creeping higher and higher up on the dark sands this would bring the surface of the sea nearer the shelf perhaps near enough for me to gain it without the rope
once on the shelf i should have a revolver to my hand and if golden and vandeleur came in a boat i would be able to give a good account of myself
having hit upon a plan of action i set myself immediately to carrying it out
traversing the beach until i had got as close as possible to the caverns mouth i took to the water and began swimming
a a to four the current was not so strong from which i imagined that the tide was nearing the flood yet it was strong enough to make my work diffi cult in the extreme
however i forged slowly ahead gaining on the current inch by inch
when i was well within the narrow walls of the entrance the heave of a wave threw me sharply against the rocks
grasping the rough projections of the wall i supported myself for a brief rest
the wall gave me an idea and when i resumed my progress toward the light it was by reaching from one projection to another and drawing my self forward
this called for the expenditure of a good deal of strength yet not so much as though i were swimming in the middle of the channel
it was probably half an hour before i reached the mouth of the cavern and found myself clutch ing a slippery point of rock in the outer wall
above me was the shelf but it was not within reach
again and again i lifted myself and tried to catch at the flat edge
the incoming waves hove me with sickening force against the jagging a a to granite and always i missed the top of the shelf by two or three inches and fell back
with muscular power going fast and spirits flagging i began debating the advisability of re turning to the cavern to rest until the tide should be at the flood when it might be i could make a second attempt with better success
in that dis couraging moment a nameless horror came zig zagging from seaward gliding toward me by a series of tacks
what i saw with terrordistended eyes was a tall triangular fin the dorsal fin of a shark
for a brief instant my whole body went lax then i gave a frenzied yell and sought to dig my way up the slippery rocks
my hands were torn with the desperate effort and the slapping waves rolled back from the cliff tinged with the blood of my wounds
the mon ster scenting the blood ripped toward me through the water the fin parting it like a black streak
i fell away from my insecure handhold
use less useless was my agonized thought a min ute half a minute and i should be plucked from the cliffs face
a a to four i knew how pearldivers fight the shark drop ping below him as he rushes and disemboweling him with the thrust of a keen blade
but a brown or a black man is safe from a shark a white man never
still if i had had the machete lying on the shelf above me heaven knows that no ex pedient would have been too desperate for me to attempt
without the machete i was as good as lost
i closed my eyes
i did not think of the treacherous skipper or vandeleur or the treasure in that supreme moment i thought only of zelda an struther
robert
the rope
quick
was i dreaming
had thoughts of the girl brought the fancy of her voice in my ears
something struck on the rocks beside me
opening my eyes i found the object to be the end of a rope
i did not look had no time
gripping the stout hempen strands i lifted myself frantic ally toward the shelf
for one horrid instant the awful fascination of death in its most grue some form held me supine at the end of the rope halfin and halfout of the water
a a to four hurry shrieked the voice above
i threw off the lethargy that had enchained my limbs
with one quick heave i laid myself across the shelf
a clash came from behind me
turning my head i noticed two bows of serrated teeth inter locked caught a glimpse of an ugly gray head and saw two staring baffled eyes dropping back under the water
a groan was wrenched from my lips and i straightened out on the narrow shelf
treachery
i may have lain five minutes on that shelf with the spray beating over me or it may have been half an hour
spent and horrorshaken as i was time passed unheeded
finally i became aware that miss anstruther was calling down to me her voice quivering with fear and dread
robert robert
why donot you speak
why donot you answer me
are you hurt
i rose to my knees and looked up all right zelda i called back to her
you saved my life
but for that rope i should have been a dead man by this time
oh i did not want you to come here alone
i told you that i did not
somehow i had a feel ing that all would not go well with you
how will you get up here
climb the rope
can you
do you feel strong enough
a a to our it was pleasant to have her so concerned about my welfare
in her voice in her manner i read plainly that she cared for me
my strength returned with a bound and i was ready to laugh at the dangers that lay behind no less than at those to come strong enough to dare anything zelda i shouted cheerfully
just see that the upper end of the rope is secure and be at your side in a jiffy
i saw her fall to at the upper end of the rope taking one halfhitch after another and belaying over all
while she was engaged in this i was drawing on my stockings and slipping revolver and machete into my belt am sure it will hold now she called down
be sure and hang tightthe shark is swimming around off the ledge
the triangular fin as i saw was weaving back ward and forward just awash
that shark has had his last chance at me i laughed gripping the rope
here i come zelda
up i went hand over fist come too a arter to four close to the edge i panted as the girl bent down to catch my arms and help me over the brink
when i had gained the flat surface of the cliffs top and while i was halfreclining against the boulder to catch my breath zelda fell at my side buried her face in her hands and began sobbing
there there little girl said i soothingly my bare arm going about her waist all over now all over now she answered brokenly think of what might have happened miss is as good as a mile i jested gaily
just keep your face in your hands please till i get into my shirt and coat and then we will go back to the hut
i have something to tell you and i know you have a good deal to tell me
the walk up the valley will be just the thing for a little exchange of information
i was not long getting into my clothes and shoes
my hat fortunately had not dropped into the sea but lay on the cliffs edge
now said as i coiled in the rope she had used please tell me where you got this line
it was hanging in the hut mr lorry a a ter to four that wonot do i objected with a smile and a shake of the head
she gave me a puzzled glance
what wonot do she queried
the rope was that part of it is well enough its the mr lorry part
you just established a prece dent by calling me robert
please keep it up
the color mounted her cheeks was so excited she murmured averting her eyes that i hardly know what i said or did was excited too but i distinctly remember the robert part of what you said
i slung the rope over my shoulder
now as we go back i added you may begin the talking had a foreboding when you left the hut she began dropping in at my side as we de scended the slope toward the valley and i was that why you watched from the door way zelda
i rallied
so that you might see the last of me
she blushed again prettily
as you are the sole protector of two lone women she reasoned demurely it was very a arter to four natural that your safety should be a prime con sideration
oh
i muttered
you had been gone only a few moments she proceeded when captain golden and mr van deleur looked in at the door of the hut
mrs brackett and i were startled of course but we said nothing not here the skipper growled with a fierce look
ask the girl said vandeleur shell know where he is
captain golden did ask me and i told him the truth that i did not know where you were
oh well well find him
captain golden de clared and he and vandeleur went on down the valley was alarmed for i felt sure the skipper in tended doing you some injury on account of what happened on the beach this morning
so you followed the skipper and vandeleur out of their sight so they would not know i was watching them
i took this with me
she smiled and for the first time i saw that she had the revolver i had left with her
whether i should have used it or not if there had been need i donot know
possibly when it ad a a to four came to the pinch i should have exercised a womans prerogative andfainted
not you i demurred admiringly
well i followed the skipper and vandeleur she went on and saw them reach the top of the cliff look downward and apparently study what lay below
they talked earnestly together and i heard captain golden give a fierce laugh as he lifted the rope and threw it from the boulder
directly afterward the two left the cliff and hurried back up the valley
as soon as they were gone i went to the ledge and looked over to see for myself
your revolver and machete were plainly to be seen on the narrow ledge and my knowledge of our instructions made me positive that you had gone into the cavern
i called to you but of course you could not hear me
then i reflected that you would need a rope when you came out so i ran back to the hut to get one that i had seen hanging there got back just in time she finished after a brief silence and you know the rest
now what did you find in the cavern
ten teakwood boxes i replied and each of them will weigh a hundred and fifty pounds
i a a ter to she clapped her hands and her hazel eyes glowed with excitement and delight
then they are really there
what is in them mr lorry shall not answer that question until you re vise its terms i averred with mock displeasure
now donot be provoking robert
that will do i smiled donot know what is in the boxes zelda
her face fell in disap pointment
you see i explained had to swim into the cavern so i couldnot burden myself with anything that would help pry up the covers
i did use a stone but the boxes are bound with strapiron and strongly nailed
it must be treasure
undoubtedly
she sighed softly am so glad she whis pered
does the treasure mean so much to you
i asked
more than you can know
i have a younger brother to support and it has been a hard strug gle for me to take care of him sincesince ar chie ceased to share the burden
a a to four i echoed her sigh for i knew that the treasure was receding farther and farther from us
mrs brackett too went on zelda is in sore need of money
she has nothing and there is a mortgage on the home her husband left her
the treasure and here she waved her hand to ward the stark headboards which we were pass 1ng is a heritage from those who lie there
who knows but that they may have gone down to death in seeking to save the treasure for us
zelda said i soberly you have asked me to keep nothing from you
shall i do that now even though it may dash your hopes
she halted with a start and gazed steadily into my face
yes she answered slowly have earned the right to know all have i not
you have and i am sure you will appreciate the situation and make the best of it as soon as i call your attention to one fact after casting the rope from the boulder captain golden and vandeleur hurried off toward the schooner
yes
can you not imagine why they did that
they had studied the face of the cliff they had a a ter to four detected the presence of the cavern they were sure that i was inside the cavern and and they wanted to get boats come back and deal with you below there as they saw fit
the girl shivered
who would believe there could be such scoundrels
that was partly their object i admitted to find me in the cavern unarmed and at their mercy
they had another object too for they certainly inferred that the cavern contained some thing that had brought us to the island
if they explore the place as they undoubtedly will they cannot help finding the boxes
when they do find them it will mean that they will consider nothing but their own gain
in other words i firmly believe that the treasure is lost to us
they would not dare she breathed with flaming eyes
men like captain golden will dare anything
he is making a dupe and a tool of vandeleur and i am certain that vandeleur will never get his share of the treasure either
he will know too much for captain welfare and to push him overboard in the night will be easy
the official log would show that he was lost a arter to through his own carelessness or swept away in a gale
but if we are on board we will not be on board zelda
unless something like a miracle happens you and i and mrs brackett will never step foot on the lady may again
then a miracle will happen robert
heaven never yet prospered such rascals as captain gold en and vandeleur
somehow some way we shall all of us receive our due hope so at least shall not yield with out a fight
what will you do will leave you to explain matters and go down to the cove in order to find out if possible what is going on aboard the schooner
please donot she begged
robert
every thing depends on you now even more than ever
if you go down to the cove and captain golden should deal treacherously with you as he has al ready done and will continue to do think what would become of mrs brackett and me
we were near the hut by that time
our feet had been lagging on the way ever since we had a a to our passed the bend in the valley and struck into the path that led from the spring am thinking of you always zelda i whis pered
if i had not met you in that san fran cisco hotel i firmly believe that i should not have followed up this hazy and extravagant venture
in going to the cove i am thinking of your inter ests even more than i am of my own
a warm light broke over her beautiful face her eyes dimmed with gathering tears and her sensitive lips trembled ever so slightly
then robert she said softly since you know how much your welfare means to me i feel that i can trust you to go
my hands were red with the wounds inflicted on them by the rocks my hair was dripping and tangled about my eyes and taken altogether i was not very presentable even for an adventurer
but i flung my arms about her drew her close and pressed my lips to hers
she fluttered away from me and off to the cabin door and as i lost myself around the next turn of the valley she was there watching and waving her hand her face flushed and her eyes like stars
a a to there were other treasures apart from those to be found in teakwood boxes treasures beside which the purest gold and the rarest pearls are not to be considered
for myself i would not have bartered that one moments joy for the con tents of all the teakwood boxes under heaven
marooned
the schooner lay snugly at anchor in the cove
no sign of life appeared about her decks and i hailed lustily
mr stubbs rose lazily from behind the bul warks
evening was drawing on and while he was plain to me i was somewhat in the shadow and he appeared in doubt as to my identity
alloy the shore he called leaning over the rail
what do you want
this is lorry mr stubbs i shouted wish youd send off a boat and take us aboard
there ainot any boats mr lorry
no boats become of them all
i knew that the schooner had three boats one at the stern davits and two on the deck house
golden an vandeleur have gone off ter circumnavigate the island
why did they take the three boats
blest if i know
a art to four they had taken the three boats and gone after cargo
there could be no other explanation aboard was my next question
an anchorwatch consistin me an the doctor an petie
when did the boats leave
nigh onto three hours ago i guess been snoozin full an by most ever since an havenot kept much track o the time believe come aboard and have a chat with you mr stubbs i volunteered ye come
swim ye do it mr lorry
i got orders from the capn an have ter kerry em out
you know how it is
a mates got ter do like hes told
what are your orders mr stubbs
to keep the schooner a cables length away from ye
i like ye fust chop myself mr lorry but theres been rum doins on this hooker ever since ye swatted the skipper over the head
it suit me uncommon ter pull out to ye if i had a boat or ter let ye come aboard purvidin orders aginst it
a a ter to four believe you mr stubbs i called gratefully
what is the skipper intending to do got me over my head now
well hes no better than a pirate and have the law on him one of these days between you an him an i donot want ter take sides
i guess you understand how fixed
i did understand
at that moment the heads of eph and petie appeared over the rail forward
whatever the mate said and did would be re peated to captain golden so he had to bridle his tongue and act judiciously
if he could have posed openly as my friend without incurring the captains displeasure i felt that stubbs would have done so
even now i was positive that he was secretly friendly toward me
while i stood there considering what should be my next move a dip of oars and a hoarse mumble of voices echoed from the coveinlet
presently three boats pushed out of the deepen ing shadows in the passage
ahoy the schooner roared the voice of cap tain golden
eph and petie turned away from the rail to a a ter to four face in the direction of the approaching boats
as stubbs answered the hail he motioned with his hand for me to retire
we got some salvage from the wreck o the gagelle went on the skipper an well hoist it aboard by the davittackle
stand by mr stubbs to lend a hand
there was exultation in captain tones
his manner of referring to the plunder as salvage was decidedly humorous
ten boxes piped vandeleur jubilantly from another of the boats
those boxes are stolen i shouted they be long to three of us who are still ashore and to vandeleur
i heard captain startled oath as it came ripping across the water
he was rounding to under the stern of the schooner
then i heard his call of way enough and saw him rise in the sternsheets and face the beach there are you he flung at me with a torrent of profanity thought you had hove to alongside the bottom
your tricky work with vandeleur didnot pan out did it be i a a to cause he had a decent skipper along that stood for fair play
avast with that
i shouted angrily
cap tain golden youre a piratical scoundrel making off with property that doesnot be long to you and live to have you up for rob bery on the high seas a rifle cracked sharply
golden had stooped picked the weapon up and fired from his hip be fore i could get an inkling of what he was about
screened by the growing dusk i was not an easy target and the skippers haste to get in the shot had marred his aim
the bullet sang harm lessly through the air
lifting the butt of the gun to his shoulder he sighted carefully for another shot
just as he pulled trigger i saw the stern of the boat veer swiftly to starboard
the second bullet also went wild
golden faced the bow with savage fury
that was you you damned swede he yelled
he leaned forward and i heard the impact of a blow a notion to make o ye but look to yerself when i git ye aboard
i believed that i understood what had hap a a to four pened
one of the swedes had pulled his oar at the right moment thus disconcerting the skip pers aim
i was grateful to the sailor but it was a rash thing for him to do
i should have fired with my revolver imme diately after the skippers first shot but for the fear of injuring some one else in the boat
as i was powerless to prevent the skipper and vande leur from carrying out their designs and know ing that further threats were worse than useless i turned and hurried toward the cleft
at the top of the beach i met zelda
she had been hurrying and was quite breathless
what was that firing robert she de manded
captain golden tried a couple of shots at me zelda
what will that scoundrel do next
i heard the firing and my first thought was that you had forgotten your promise
any promise i make you i consider sacred
please donot put it like that
did you learn anything about captain intentions
all that is necessary
he intends to kill me a a to four if he can and thought he had already accom plished it at the cavern
he is equal to anything breathed zelda
when i reached the schooner i proceeded the skipper vandeleur and most of the crew had gone and taken all the boats
stubbs was in charge and he said the skipper had left orders not to let me come aboard suppose so exclaimed zelda angrily
cap tain golden will not let you step foot on the ship again glad of it robert
after what has happened i shouldnot feel easy a minute if we were there
nevertheless zelda we shall have to go aboard the schooner and take our chances
it would be plain starvation for us to stay on this island you know better that than that you should be shot or thrown overboard she cried recklessly
then she stamped her foot and stared toward the schooner
oh i wish i wish i were a man
then i could help you as you ought to be helped
you have already helped me more than any man could have done and what are they doing down there
she a a to four pointed toward the shadowy boats near the schooners stern
they are hoisting aboard the teakwood cases i answered
she received the announcement calmly
well let them let them have their teakwood cases and sail away with them
after all it is a small price to pay for your safety
i am satis fied robert
she turned to me and stretched out her hand
let us go back to the hut she added smilingly
we have a surprise for you there am not satisfied little girl i returned ear nestly taking her hand and before we return to the hut i want to tell you of a plan
it isnot best to excite mrs brackett by talking the mat ter over before her
what is the plan
zelda asked suspiciously
unless something is done we shall be left on the island i continued am used to hard ships but that would not do for you and mrs brackett
no she flashed
well then sir what do you want to do with mrs brackett and me
we must all leave fortune island on the a arter to four schooner i insisted
that is best for ladies and for me too you when we are on the schooner we are in the same ship with the treas ure and there is always the chance that some thing will turn matters our way
well she asked impatiently
if i can get aboard the schooner tonight and have a quiet talk with the mate i am sure we can reach some sort of an understanding
what good will an understanding with the mate do you robert
mr stubbs will obey cap tain golden
besides how would you get aboard
swim shouldnot think after what you went through today youd ever want to get into salt water again
there probably isnot a single shark in the whole lagoon
you donot want to go aboard the schooner merely totalk with mr stubbs asserted zelda after a short period of reflection
what is your real reason robert
well i admitted charily if i could make a a a to four prisoner of the skipper and bring him ashore we would have everything in our own hands
she turned squarely about and stared at me
you are mad to think of it
the very idea of your swimming out to the schooner climbing aboard then making a prisoner of captain gold en and bringing him ashorewith every one on board against you
you shall not attempt any such foolhardy plan as that she added deci sively
but we must do something i protested
will you take my advice robert she asked
you are a girl of good judgment zelda and i should be glad of your counsel
then do nothing tonight
give captain golden until tomorrow morning to think this matter over
he is doing wronghe is doing something that will make him amenable to the law
he knows all this and sober second thought will lead him to see his error
in the morning we will all three go down to the beach and have a talk with him
but where will you and mrs brackett stay tonight
i asked in dismay
she laughed
a a to four why in the hut you goose she answered
it is quite comfortable
i shall be far more contented there than i would be aboard the schooner
and there is the matter of food i went on remembering what a terrific inroad i had made on the contents of the hamper at noon
you and mrs brackett must not go hungry
we do not intend to go hungry robert nor to let you go hungry either
i tell you we had a surprise at the hut
will you promise to put aside that crazy plan of yours and let further action lie over until tomorrow morning
of course i answered but against my better judgment if you want it that way do want it that way she returned with finality and so we will consider the matter set tled
now for the surprise
the surprise consisted of a hot supper
zelda and mrs brackett had found matches broken up pieces of the wreckage for firewood and had built a fire in the stove
somewhere about the hut they had found cof fee sugar and condensed milk
a tin of canned meat and another of tomatoes had been opened a a to four and there was enough bread left in the hamper to supply the evening meal
considering our sad discoveries of the day we were far from being a jolly party but after so many weeks on shipboard i am sure we all en joyed the land
mrs brackett was pensive but i could see that she was slowly recovering from the bitter blow of the morning
my candles were all in the cavern so we had nothing with which to make a light
evening was well advanced before we finished our sup per and it was something of a feat to find your own dishes and keep from helping yourself out of your neighbors
mrs brackett and zelda made themselves as comfortable as they could in the hut and i took some blankets and went out of doors to pass the night
truth to tell i feared a visit from cap tain golden and his men for i chose to think that instead of passing a night in repentance he would be concocting fresh deviltry
so i took both revolvers and laid myself down at a point where i should be aroused by intruders before they had a chance to reach the hut
noth ing untoward happened to us however and i a a to four slept soundly and awoke in excellent spirits and mightily refreshed
we breakfasted off the remains of our supper and then the three of us set off toward the cove for our intended colloquy with the supposedly repentant captain golden
as we advanced along the valley toward the top of the beach we failed to descry the tall masts of the lady may and when we reached the beach our staring eyes swept the lagoon only to return and rest upon each other in blank dismay
the schooner had fled from the island some time during the night
marooned
i gasped
dear dear murmured mrs brackett toss ing her hands that
i explained and the poor lady fell to sobbing and bewailing
as usual zelda made it her duty to soothe and console her and i imagined that zelda was not so grievously cast down by our misfortune as she might have been
only the mate
zelda and i had been keeping as many of the serious details of our situation from mrs brack ett as we could
the good woman was naturally pessimistic and we aimed to show her the bright side of the picture
now in order to reconcile her with her lot we told of captain treachery in the mat ter of the teakwood cases and how it had led to the further treachery of our marooning
zelda showed her how much safer and better off we were on the island than we could possibly have been on the schooner and so well did she talk that mrs brackett came almost to regard that barren isle as a haven of refuge and our ma rooning a providence
i held the private opinion that zelda had felt all along that something of this sort would hap penindeed that she desired it to happenand that she was throwing her full heart into the per suasion of mrs brackett
a a ter to four our elderly companion seemed to have but one regret the mortgage on her emmetsburg home might be foreclosed before a ship took us off and carried her away to frisco in time to pay the in terest
while the two ladies were talking i climbed the arroyobank and gazed to seaward in all di rections
there was no sign of the lady may so they must have hove up the anchor and got clear of the island very soon after our teakwood cases had been put aboard
well it was consoling to know that i had saved the better part of my patrimony even though the treasure had been lost
i should have about four thousand dollars with which to make a beginning when we regained our own coun try
from the blank sea i brought my gaze to the valley and looked at the lithe graceful form of zelda as she moved about mrs brackett like a ministering angel
after all what did i care for the treasure
it was the treasure that had brought zelda and me together
now that it had accomplished its a a to four purpose it might take wings and welcome
i felt in my heart that a richer prize was to be mine
we might talk our situation over i observed descending the hill and rejoining my compan ions
our chance of being taken off this island at an early day is not flattering
what of that robert demanded zelda
it is a novel experience and i am sure we will en joy it
besides we are sure to be taken off some time you know the homely question of food i sug gested simple enough yet all important
find some coconuts brightened mrs brack ett
there isnot a coconuttree on the island mrs brackett i answered gravely
just as well sighed mrs brackett folding her hands with quiet determination to endure any thing donot think i should be overly fond of coconuts for a steady diet
i imagine they wouldnot be healthful
but i thought ships went every which way across the ocean mr lorry
they have certain tracks they follow between different points i explained little farther to the west would put us in the way of boats ply a a to four ing between san francisco and the samoa islands and if we were farther east we would be in the way of traffic between san francisco and new zealand ner of the pacific
but this is an obscure cor the fact that fortune island is not on the charts is proof that it is seldom vis ited
but well surely be rescued after a while wonot we
mrs brackett inquired
oh of course i replied indefinitely will plant a flagstaff at each end of the island so that whenever a ship passes those aboard will know there are people here who are anxious to be taken off am pretty sure said mrs brackett that mr cartwright will take care of my interest for me when it comes due know where i am an hes been a real good friend to me since death saved enough out of that two hundred dollars mr cartwright gave me to pay the interest wouldnot worry about that mrs brackett i advised left a curstanthem in the parlorwindow at home she sighed regretfully donot know a a to how i ever come to forget it when i took all my other plants over to mrs henry i know as much as anythin in the world that be away so long that curstanthemll just dry up like a bone wouldnot fret about anything mrs brack ett i went on but try y
goodness she burst out clean forgot about my carpetbag
that ornery captain gold en has sailed away with that too
it never rains but it pours does it deary
and she looked pathetically into face
i gave over trying to be of any comfort to mrs brackett and went down toward the beach
there i made a find
a number of objects lay in a promiscuous heap a suitcase of the recently lamented carpetbag of mrs and my own bat tered satchel
over under and around these were half a dozen sides of bacon two hams a cheese a couple of bags of bread tins of coffee tea and condensed milk and three pairs of neatly rolled blankets
surmounting the pile was a large piece of brown paper weighted with a stone
i took the a a to four paper from the pile and read the following writ ten in a cramped and almost illegible hand mr lorry didun hav no han in it an swoar wold not leeve ilan without this truck was putt ashoar for you dam sory but am only the mate respeckfuly stubbs
that was stubbs for you
waving the paper above my head i called to the ladies and they at once hurried down to the beach
we have one friend aboard the lady may at all events said see what mr stubbs put ashore for us always thought mr stubbs was too good a man to sail with captain golden declared zel da her eyes glowing at sight of her suitcase
mrs brackett pounced upon the carpetbag and we went through the heterogeneous heap parcel by parcel
it begins to look as though the food ques tion was irrevocably settled said zelda
mr stubbs has done a great deal for us i went on but he will do even more
unless i misread him he will have some ship headed for fortune island to take us off before very long
here is a note he left with the goods
a a to four zelda took the note and studied it for a few there was a heart of gold back of that she commented
we returned to the hut carrying as much of the plunder as we could
after that i made half a dozen trips and soon had it all at headquarters
inasmuch as my money paid for this i re marked laughingly as i put down the last load think we are fairly entitled to it
the glint came into hazel eyes as it always did when she was deeply stirred
you are minus a good deal of money rob ert said she through captain dis honesty and treacherous conduct
the only pos sible way you could have been repaid was out of the contents of those stolen boxes
really you know and the eyeflash was followed by a wan little smile still have the feeling that those boxes will yet come to us
i shook my head
the boxes perhaps i qualified but not what is in them
captain golden is too old a hand to let any treasure slip through his fingers
at luncheon that day mrs brackett was a a to four greatly depressed
now and again some stirring event would lure her mind from those mounds and melancholy headboards only to let it swing back once more and plunge her into deeper sad ness
and in a measure it was so with zelda
but zelda was younger and of firmer fiber
realizing the necessity of bearing up under our misfortunes so that she might be of help to me and a source of consolation to mrs brackett she thrust her own grief resolutely aside
our enforced stay on the island be it long or short would pass most quickly and comfortably if we could contrive to keep ourselves busy
i had already planned a few tasks but my chief concern was to lay out enough work so that none of us should be forced into idleness
grief i un derstood very well takes firmest hold of those minds which have nothing to do but dwell on their sorrows
the first piece of work i had set for myself i felt sure would not be regarded with favor by zelda so it was with some misgivings that i pushed back from the table and prepared to broach the subject to my companions
back to the zelda said there is one point in recent affairs which we must not overlook
she turned her wide hazel eyes upon me with a questioning lift of the brows
what point is that robert she asked
perhaps i went on all the teakwood boxes were not removed from the cave
golden and vandeleur must have had to work hurriedly and it might be that they missed some of them
i was angling for an excuse to pay the cavern another visit and in my own mind i had small doubt that golden and vandeleur had made a clean sweep of all the boxes
indeed i had heard vandeleur call out something to the effect that they had ten boxes with them in the boats short ly after my colloquy with stubbs from the beach
however i thought it well to make sure and was bending my energies toward securing zel das consent to my plan
no robert and zelda shook her head de a arter to four cidedly we both know what sort of man cap tain golden is and we know he would not leave that cave until he had secured every box
at any rate said believe i will go down there again and see for myself
a shudder ran through the girl and a look of horror crossed her face
you wouldnot think of such a thing she cried
there is no danger i returned reassur ingly now that our enemies have left the island
but the sharks
they are more to be feared than human enemies robert not one chance in a hundred zelda that there will be any sharks around the cave during the short time i shall be there
but if one should come said she her voice tense and her face full of foreboding if anything should happen to you what would be come of us
you must take no unnecessary risks would not do that i answered gravely and if i thought i was taking any long chance i would not mention the matter
but i did not a a to four give the cavern a very thorough examination when i was there as the finding of the boxes took up most of my attention
now i am going back again and go over the place more carefully
mrs brackett lifted her griefstricken face
you might find something there that tom had left mr lorry said she
if tom and brother and your cousin and this trent had anything to do with putting those boxes in the cave like as not they may have left something else there toosomething it might be well for us to find
mrs brackett was proving an unexpected ally
i could see that zelda was wavering and that mrs brackett had mentioned something which had not before occurred to her
nevertheless she had an objection
depend on it said she that whatever was left in the cave was found and carried away by captain golden and vandeleur left some matches and candles there i went on and i donot believe that golden and his land ingparty could find them
we could use them very handily now i replied with a smile
then i got up and took down the coil of rope a a ter to ur which had served me so well on the occasion of my first visit to the cave
you and mrs brackett might come with me zelda i added and watch for sharks from the top of the cliff while i am below
of course we shall go with you declared zelda and we left the hut forthwith
when we passed the headboards in making our way along the valley mrs grief opened afresh
zelda slipped an arm around her and spoke such words of comfort as her own grieving mind could suggest
as soon as we reached the turn of the valley and had begun climbing the bank i was pleased to see that the prospect of our adventure was claiming more and more of mrs attention
as we crossed the flat crest of the hill and drew close to the brink of the cliff mrs brackett paused fear fully
mercy she gasped
is the cave down there you ever get to it mr lorry
and how were those boxes ever taken down there in the first place
clinging to zelda she edged cautiously toward a arter to four the brink and stood looking down at the lashing get down easily enough i answered throwing off my coat and dropping down to take off my shoes
when the boxes went into the cave mrs brackett they were taken in by means of a boat
if we had a boat at hand now we could all visit the cave and do it safely and easily
the way i am going is safe enoughonly a lit tle more difficult thats all
are you looking for sharks fins zelda
i finished laughingly
she was standing close to the edge of the cliff and her eyes were wandering sharply over the smooth water to seaward
yes she answered shifting her gaze to me and i be easy a minute until you are with us again robert
the look in her eyes disturbed me
it was pleasant to know that my welfare meant so much to her but it seemed brutal to play with her fears by going on
i felt that it was due to all of us however that a second and final examination should be made of the cave
we must know be yond all peradventure that all the boxes had been removed by golden and vandeleur
a a to ur i was not long in knotting a noose in the end of the rope and in throwing it over the boulder with my folded coat as a cushion then i dropped the free end of the rope to the shelf
at that point i discovered that this rope was shorter than the one i had used before but a mental calcu lation convinced me that it would reach far enough inside the cave to answer my purpose
both revolvers i left with zelda am certain youll not see any sharks zelda said but if you do shoot at them
that will give me warning
your voice wouldnot reach me in the cave but i could hear a revolvershot
you wonot be long
zelda asked with an im ploring note in her voice as i seated myself on the brink preparatory to descending
not a moment longer than necessary i re plied
meanwhile please donot worry
with that i gripped the rope and started down
when i reached the shelf i looked up and saw two white faces peering down at me
that was easy enough i cried waving my hand and the rest will be just as easy
removing my shirt and stockings i left them a a ter to four on the shelf then tying the rope to my belt i plunged into the churning surf and raced through the cavern entrance
having gone over the course once i took my bearings and proceeded to make a landing with out any preliminary investigation
as on the other time i was halted in a smother of foam when i took up the slack in the rope but i at once began swimming to the right and quickly found bottom
untying the rope from my belt i weighted it with a stone as i had done before then after a moments rest i fell to hunting for the niche where i had left the candles and matches
luck was with me and before many minutes had passed i was moving up and down the subter ranean strand looking for whatever i might find
i discovered many footprints in the damp sand and came upon the spot where the boats had nosed into the beach but as for teakwood boxes there was not one to be seen
i was not sur prised on the contrary i should have been sur prised if i had found that even one had been left
having thus settled the matter of the treasure to my complete satisfaction i began a thorough a a to four investigation of the cave
i went at this sys tematically zigzagging back and forth between the wall and the waters edge and covering every foot of ground
the sum of my discoveries was a claspknife
it was bright and new which was proof positive that it had not lain for any length of time in the damp air of the cave
quite likely it had been dropped by one of the landingparty from the lady may with a sense of keen disappointment because of my failure to discover anything worth while i made my way to the spot where i had seen the boxes
there by merest chance a flash of can dlelight on the wall revealed something that drew my instant attention
a flat surface of the wall had been scratched deeply with some hard pointed instrument
my surprise was great when i found that the indentations took the form of letters and that the letters grouped themselves into words
not a little excited i pushed the candle closer to the wall
the printing was in two lines roughly done but all perfectly legible capt eugene trent brigantine gazelle arthur mayhew 9th a a to four that was all but brief and unsatisfactory though it was the words came like a message from the tomb
trent and mayhew
were they the ones who had brought the teakwood boxes to the cavern
if so why had they not chiseled in the rock some thing about anstruther and brackett
thinking i might discover something by searching the wall further i began examining the stones carefully and working my way foot by foot around the cavern
perhaps i had been at this work for a quarter of an hour when i heard a sound that forced me from the wall with a frantic leap
the candle shook in my hand and i staggered unsteadily hoping against hope that my ears had played me a trick
but i was not mistaken
once more the sound floated in through the cavern entrance muffled but distinct
it was the report of a revolver
escape from the cave
in my time i have heard it said of some men that they did not know what fear was
per sonally i doubt if such a man ever lived
there would be no merit in courage if there were no such thing as fear
but a test for any man would be to place him as i was placed then immured in a cave whose only exit was by an arm of the seablockaded by a maneating shark
my life as a soldier of fortune had brought me face to face with many perils but never had danger played such havoc with my nerves as it did then
and the fact that i had gone into it recklessly and openeyed in no wise ministered to my peace of mind
zelda had counseled me against taking the risk and i had laughed at her fears
dropping nervelessly on the wet sand i peered with wild eyes toward the entrance of the cave and upbraided myself for being a headstrong fool
there had been nothing to gain by the ven a a to four ture and everything to lose in case luck happened to go against me
even if i had found a box of treasure how would it have helped us in our sorry situation
now when i found myself trapped i could conjure up a thousand and one reasons why i should never have paid that second visit to the but if i had one thought for myself i had two for zelda and mrs brackett
i pictured them crouching on the brink of the cliff staring with terrorstricken eyes at the triangular fins dart ing through the water
unable to aid me what must have been their hopelessness and despair
this thought brought back my courage
i had the claspknife
with that in my belt and with the rope to aid me i would swim and fight my way back to the shelf
before i set out on my return i watched the sunlit stretch of water that led into the cave
nothing struck athwart the channel to arouse my fears
if i worked quickly and made the best use of the rope there was a chance that i could gain the shelf unmolested
passing hurriedly around the beach to the place where i had left the end of the rope i planted a arter to four what remained of my candle in the sand wrapped the rest of the candles and the matches in their waterproof covering tied the packet to my belt and then plunged resolutely into the water
the current buffeted me roughly but the pull of the rope and the resistance my body offered to the current served to buoy me up
i had little swimming to do and my way along the lifeline
from time to time i lifted my head and shoulders above the waves shook the water from my eyes and stared about me
the thing i dreaded i failed to see and presently i was back on the shelf overcome with a sense of relief almost as much as i was by the fatigue of my fierce struggle with the current
robert a voice called down to me
rising to my knees i looked upward
zelda and mrs brackett were staring over the cliffs edge the shark zelda
i cried
it was a mistake robert she answered am sorry if we alarmed you but our nerves were none too steady
look
she pointed as she spoke
following her fin ger with my eyes i saw a bit of wreckage twisting a arter to four and whirling in the waves
i could afford to laugh now
was that what you saw
i asked getting into my shirt
and you thought it was a shark
i made a mental reservation then and there that neither of my companions should ever know what a bad halfhour they had given me in the cave
after a brief rest i started up the face of the fiftyfoot cliff finally getting over the top with the aid of zelda and mrs brackett the last time i panted as i lay sprawled out in the sun that i shall ever visit the cave
did you discover anything robert that made the risk worth while asked zelda found this i answered taking the knife from my belt
mrs brackett gave the blade a quick look then turned away her eyes disappointedly boxes were all gone mr lorry she asked
golden and vandeleur made a clean sweep
i saw where their boats had grounded on the beach and where they had tramped back and forth load a a to four ing the boxes but this knife was all they had left behind
but you got the candles and matches said zelda quietly watching as i untied the packet from my belt
all the candles and matches in the world robert wouldnot pay for what what we went through up here on the cliff while waiting for you to come
i was properly rebuked and hoped in my soul that never again should i see such a look of re proach as was then in hazel eyes
well said we know exactly where we stand now
if i hadnot investigated the cave we might always have had the feeling that some of the treasure had been left there
now we know that all of it was taken from the island in the lady may
on the wall i bit the words off short wondering how my companions would take it when i told them that trent and mayhew had left signs of their pres ence in the cave while brother and mrs son had not
on the wall fluttered mrs brackett her face lighting with sudden hope
did you find something on the wall of that cave mr lorry
a a to four it was nothing of any importance mrs brackett said i gently just the names of cap tain trent and my cousin arthur scratched on the stone
after name followed the two words brigantine gazelle and after 9th regiment why mrs brackett murmured that was regiment
and added zelda
then said my cousin your brother zel da and mrs son all belonged to the same regimentperhaps to the same company
this shows how the three might have been thrown together but it doesnot help us much otherwise
where does captain trent and the gazelle come in
mrs brackett shook her head in pathetic be wilderment
zelda gave a deep sigh
some time said zelda all this may be made clear to us but it is very dark and mysterious now
our relatives were in the brigantine with captain trent and they had those teakwood boxes with them
the brigantine was wrecked and four of those on board got safely ashore and took the boxes to the cave
that is all we really a a to four know
let us not plague ourselves with surmises but accept the situation as we find itand go back to the hut
we can do nothing more rob ert but wait and hope for the best
i put on my shoes and coat coiled up the rope and swung it over my shoulder then we retraced our way across the crest of the hill through the valley and back to the rude little shanty which had now become our home
in the end i think we were all better for that afternoons experience
it brought home to us as nothing else could have done our mutual need of each other in our forlorn situation and taught us to grieve less over what we had lost and to do more toward cultivating an optimistic spirit for the general good
mrs brackett sighed as we passed the row of headboards in the valley but there was resigna tion in her face and a calm determination to make the best of her lot
island days
the pall of misfortune rested upon us but lightly
the shadows cast by that gloomy row of carved boards beyond the spring did not often reach the place which we called home
never in my wildest dreams did i think i could be so happy and contented as i was during those days we spent on that barren little island
it was the most satisfying kind of happiness too for it had its undernote of resignation which hal lowed it and gave it the ring of true worth
the tradewind blowing almost constantly from the northeast tempered the heat of the shadeless valley
so far from inducing languor the air was like wine and inspired to effort
zelda worked by my side in the several out door tasks we set for ourselves helping to plan as well as to execute
mrs brackett assumed charge of the house and the culinary operations
from the wreckage near the hut zelda and i dug out one of the brigantines upper yards
a art to four this i hacked in two at the middle with the ma chete and we carried one half to the eastern end of the island and the other half to the western end
we set them up on the highest elevation planting them firmly in a nest of stones
then we made two streamers out of a white blanket which we had found in the hut using needles and coarse thread donated by mrs brackett out of the contents of her carpetbag
these stream ers we flew from the tops of our flagpoles ho ping they would attract the notice of any wander ing ship that chanced to pass in our vicinity
while we still had faith that stubbs would send a vessel to pick us up yet we felt that we should do everything possible to hasten our rescue
when the poles were set and the streamers in place zelda and i had other work come to our hands in the sand opposite the point where the gazelle had met her fate we discov ered a whaleboat
the boat had been badly stove in aft but she was sound forward as zelda and i found when we had dug her out of the beach
repair her robert said zelda
what for
i queried mentally weighing the task and our means for accomplishing it
a a to four so you can take me to see the cavern and so we can pay a visit to the gazelle
i had long wanted to visit the wreck of the brigantine myself just to see if anything could be found that would throw light upon the situa tion we had encountered on the island suggestion was a good one and we started to carry it out
we worked on the beach transporting our slen der supply of materials from the hut
the re pairs on the whaleboat were never finished for the reason that we were interrupted in our long task by a rescue but i look back on that era of planning and working as one of the most delight ful periods of my life
we had the machete and we had a butcher knife
of the latter we made a saw serrating its straight edge with pieces of flint
one entire day was consumed in the manufac ture of the saw and i remember the joy with which zelda saw me haggle it through a piece of board
i was half an hour getting through six inches of pine and she applauded heartily when i straightened erect with the two pieces of board in my hands
a a ter to four our prospective operations were all detailed in advance
we were to get nails from the wreck age unlay rope to get material for calking and we were to try to make a cement from powdered shells as a substitute for pitch
the first step was to saw the whaleboat in two just forward of the wrecked stern
this we ac complished in three days
an oak sternpost was worked out with the machete and a knife made fast to the shortened keel of the whaleboat and strengthened with a sternpostknee
then we began cutting out the lumber to fill in the gap at the square stern
while i gouged away with the butcherknife saw and pounded with a stone hammer zelda sat on the beach beside me unlaying rope for calking
where do you suppose those ten teakwood boxes came from robert she once asked me
we talked a great deal while we worked and our illfated expedition was a neverfailing topic got me guessing as the man says and i gave her a quizzical glance from the clew of one eye somehow suggests china to me i added a moment later
a arter to four have you ever tried to guess how those teak wood cases came to be in the gazelle
no zelda
i have never even tried to guess how thomas brackett my cousin arthur or your brother archie came to be in the gazelle
they were soldiers and supposedly off some where in the philippines or in china
what were they doing on captain brigantine with ten teakwood cases a condition of affairs that defies analysis
some one of the four sent us those cards with instructions to meet at the palace hotel on april twentyfifth
presumably that was my cousin arthur
it must have been
presumably also he was taken off this island for he could never have sent the cards from here
why did he deal through lawyers instead of sending the cards directly to us
in my case zelda it was impossible for him to deal directly with me as he did not know my address
i have been a rolling stone you know and rolling stones are proverbially hard to find
your cousin i think dealt with only one law a arter to four yer robert and that was mr price
if so your cousin must have been in san francisco
if arthur was in san francisco said i in credulously why did he not come to see me
why did he not help us with advice give ex planations or even join the expedition
he may have been unable to do so or perhaps he had some good reason for hanging back
i shook my head hopelessly bootless to do any surmising now zelda treasure has vanished and the mystery will probably remain unsolved
the treasure will return and the mystery will be solved she asserted with quiet convic tion
day after day we labored on
we came to be completely wrapped up in the rejuvenation of that whaleboat rushing to the hut for our meals and then rushing off again with hardly half a dozen words for mrs brackett
two weeks slipped away
most unexpectedly the lapse of the fortnight brought us to the end of our island probation
it was afternoon and i was just finishing off a a to four the stern of the whaleboat preparatory to calk ing
very quietly zelda announced a ship robert
i turned quickly around
the girl was looking seaward shading her eyes with her hand
there was no trace in her of the joy a cast away would be expected to feel in the circum stances
she had said a ship robert just as she might have remarked here comes aunt sarah to call us to supper
the ship was a foreandafter and was stand ing in quite close schooner said you arenot in much of a transport zelda you glad were going to be taken off suppose i am she answered dubiously with a regretful look at our unfinished work but i wish the rescue could have been delayed until we had got the whaleboat into the water
throwing down the stone hammer i stepped to her side
you have been happy here i asked in spite of the fact that we were marooned and that we have lost the treasure
happy yes she murmured happier than i ever thought i could be
a arter to four have been happy too i said taking her hand
even a barren rock in the pacific be comes a paradise when there is work to be done and love to robert she cried out showing some excite ment at last
that ship is the lady may i had not been watching the schooner but try ing to catch the hazel eyes which were evading mine and gazing seaward words star tled me and i turned and stared across the sunlit zelda was right
the schooner was none other than our old friend the lady may
the main question was this why was she re turning
did the fact bode well or ill for the three on the island
a new master
zelda and i hastened to carry the news to mrs brackett
there was not the least doubt as to that good ladys feelings for she was fairly be side herself with joy
with zelda and me i believe mrs brackett had achieved a certain amount of contentment there on the island
but the roots of her con tentment had not struck so deep that she felt constrained to regret the end of her probation
together we proceeded to the westernmost ele vation
the schooner bearing down on the island smartly from the northeast would cer tainly hunt for her old anchorage in the cove
for two hours we watched her
coming around the end of the island she beat in through the leeward passage and splashed her anchor into the lagoon
lying directly under us what i saw on her decks surprised me
the skipper with the fiery hair was not in evi dence
neither was vandeleur
a arter to stubbs was on the poop and his raucous voice rolled up to us as he gave his peremptory orders
i observed that he was armed with a rifle
anderson also armed was forward among the crew
larsen a revolver thrust through his belt stood aft alongside of stubbs
the hands forward moved nimbly enough yet it was clear that armed authority alone held their respect
stubbs looked up at us and motioned toward the beach
when we gained the sands anderson was on his way to us in the dory
the boat grounded and he stepped ashore with a grim smile
all well mr lorry he asked
all well anderson i replied hap pened aboard the schooner prefer to let captain stubbs tell you that sir
you are to go aboard in the dory and i am to help the ladies get their traps down to the beach
i looked at zelda questioningly
we will help mr anderson robert said she
besides we shall want to go over by the spring before we go aboard
a arter to four she and mrs brackett wanted to pay a last visit to the graves and they wanted to be alone
you can go there tomorrow zelda i ad vised
begging your pardon sir put in anderson but captain stubbs wants to get away tonight
you will understand why when you get on board the reason too he sent me ashore in stead of coming himself
i pushed off the dory and got in
a few min utes laid me alongside the schooners stern and i climbed to the deck
glad to meet ye mr lorry grinned stubbs
he had the worn tired look of a man who has encountered trouble and bested it by grim en durance
thought yed git along all right fer a while with the stuff i piled on the beach
i shook his hand heartily
he leaned against the forward part of the cabin where he could keep watch of the men and kept the rifle in his hands
larsen was forward leaning against the starboard rail
the two americans the mex ican and the kanaka huddled sullenly against the port rail opposite been going on here mr stubbs
i a a to asked
four captain golden and vande leur locked in your old stateroom an the skipper is in irons in his bunk
in irons
i echoed
off his head explained stubbs batty as they make em
that puts me in capn see that happens i tacks about an stands fer this island to undo the wrong the skipper done ye a whole man captain stubbs said i gratefully and youll lose nothing by acting as you have done
when golden has charge i does as he says which is plain sailorin an what a mate agrees to when he signs on
but when the skipper runs foul o an accident an goes loony then the mate steps in an acts accordin to his own lights
no sealawyer can git around that eh mr lorry
right is on your side captain stubbs i agreed
better leave off the captain part mr lorry only actin capn ye know all down in the log shipshape an proper
them teak wood boxes o yourn is locked up in the state a a ter to four room along with vandeleur
one of em was pried open by golden but i donot think anythin ter speak of was taken out
what happened to the captain mr stubbs
he was halfseas over an tumbled down the poopsteps
there was a gun in his pocket an it went off the bullet plowin along his anatermy an lodgin somers in his head
he was able ter move around but he went off the jump right from the start
it took four o us ter handle him an git him inter the cabin him babblin all the time about everythinye could think of
we got the irons on him an fer the last two days hes been lyin in a sort o stupor rousin jest enough ter take his meals
when did this happen
we was nine days out beatin up aginst the wind
i havenot the least idee where we was boundthat was something golden an vande leur had settled between em
i didnot care fer that howsumever
i got command i or dered the ship about an laid a course fer this island agin
most o the hands had been conspirin an workin tord trouble ever since them boxes was a a ter to histed aboard
my orders terbout ship brought on a scrap cause the crew didnot want ter come back here
what they wantedall exceptin an derson an ter open them teakwood boxes share an share alike put inter some south american port and abandon the lady may we had a nasty fight of it but anderson an larsen stood by me an eph an petie kep hands off
i made anderson actin mate an larsen second mate both ter have doublepay until we got back them four lads aginst the port rail we dassenot trust out from under our guns fer a minit
ever since we put about been on deck most o the time an the crack of a revolver interrupted stubbs
the sharp report was followed by a yell and the sound of a struggle
the mexican and the kanaka had leaped to one of the boats on the forward house
larsen had ordered them back and allison and minturn had rushed across the deck to disarm him
larsen had time to shoot and minturn fell back cursing and gripping at his left wrist
al lison closed with larsen and the mexican and the kanaka jumped down from the house and a a to four rushed toward the scene of the struggle with knives in their hands
git back ye murderin swabs yelled stubbs
back i say or i puts a shot inter ye betwixt wind an water
springing to the main deck i rushed forward grabbing a belayingpin as i went
leaving lar sen to settle for allison i dodged the knife and swung on his head with the pin
he tumbled in his tracks
the mexican seeing stubbs rifle trained on him threw down his knife and tossed his hands in the air
i picked up the knife and the and threw them overboard
by then stubbs had raced to the scene
pluck ing allison away from larsen with a steellike grip he flung him clear across the deck and against the port rail
as the fellow jumped up stubbs handed him a fierce blow directly between the eyes and down he went like an ox under the poleax
the four were then dragged and kicked to the hatch and thrown below
stay there ye onnery whelps shouted stubbs till i tell ye ter come on deck
if one o ye shows his head with a a ter to four out orders put a bullet through it
stubbs closed the hatch and turned away a sample mr lorry said he it shows whats lible ter happen when ye got a lot o beachcomb ers forard an a few boxes o treasure aft
but git you an them boxes safe ter frisco if i hev ter kill every manjack in the focsle
larsen had been a bit roughhandled but not seriously hurt
ay tank day vant to steal da boat an go shore said he
sarve em bloody right if put em ashore an leave em growled stubbs would too if i didnot need em ter work ship
leaving larsen to guard the hatch stubbs and i went below
petie was looking after the captain face was haggard his red hair strag gled about his brow and through the tangle the unshielded cavity of his defunct eye showed hor ribly
under the hair and hiding the depression in the temple was a white bandage
the skip pers eye was closed and he seemed asleep
his manacled hands lay across his breast
his feet were not secured
a a to four had ankleirons on him fer a spell said stubbs an kept him lashed ter the bunk be sides
that was when he was vilent easier now
petie stays right with im all the time
is there any one on board that knows any thing about surgery or medicine
i asked
anderson does
he examined the skipper arter he quieted down sost we could sheer along side without a fracas
but its too much of a problem fer anderson
anderson thinks the only thing we kin do is ter leave the skipper like he is till we git back we moved on to the stateroom unlocked the door and called to vandeleur
he came out crawling over the boxes that filled the space be tween the lower bunk and the bulkhead
he was an exceedingly disheartened youth if appear ances counted for anything the use of keeping me locked up he whimpered
this isnot my doing mr lorry
golden was to blame admit i told him moren i ought to but after that he took every thing in his own hands donot you know
i a a ter to four havenot done right but willing to let bygones be bygones if you are
he thrust out his hand toward me
i turned away in disgust
it wonot be necessary to keep him locked up there any longer mr stubbs said his power for evil is gone and there are men enough aboard now to look after the four in the and vandeleur too if he needs it
jest as you say mr lorry returned stubbs but i never did hev any use fer that towheaded lubber
two hours later the schooner was hailed from the shore and i rowed over in the dory and brought back zelda mrs brackett anderson and the little heap of goods they had carried to the beach
mrs brackett was crying softly and eyes were red
about nine oclock that evening we caught the wind in our topsails and worked through the leeward channel into the open sea then we put about gave the island a wide berth and laid course for home
the only event worthy of record during that a arter to four homeward voyage happened on the first night out
some blame was afterward attached to stubbs and indirectly to the rest of us because of it yet stubbs was asleep in his berth at the time and the rest of us on deck or below were as powerless to prevent the tragedy as though we had been a thousand miles away
mrs brackett and zelda were in their state room
i was standing the first watch with an derson helping to keep an eye on allison and the kanaka who had been brought up from the fore castle for duty
stubbs as has been stated was getting a little needed rest in the stateroom occu pied by vandeleur
the kanaka had the wheel
suddenly an earsplitting yell echoed from be low decks aft
an instant later i saw a form bound through the companion jump to the rail and go over the side head first
it all happened so quickly that no one could get close enough to interfere before the splash alongside told that the man had struck the water
man overboard came the yell
anderson shot his orders rapidly at the ka naka and i leaped to help allison with the sails
the schooner came around and when i went aft a a to four i found that larsen had come up and was help ing anderson clear away the dory
it was captain golden said anderson
larsen says he jumped out of his bunk bowled petie over with a doublehanded blow of the steel cuffs and rushed for the deck
larsen and i manned the dory while anderson climbed the main rigging to watch and direct us
frisco again
our efforts were useless
manacled as the skipper was he must have gone down like a piece of lead
larsen and i cruised about for two hours and were then called back to the schooner by stubbs
no use wastin any more time said stubbs the skippers got his whatfor though ruther it had come in any other way git you an anderson ter sign the log as witnesses mr lor ry when i write it up in the mornin
the schooner was once more put on her course and we bore away leaving the illfated skipper somewhere in the broad reach of waters behind
it was a depressing event
captain golden had been no friend of mine and he had tried at least twice to take my life yet the suddenness with which he had met his end inspired a gruesome feeling which i did not get over for days
zelda received the news of the skippers death a a to four calmly and without comment
mrs humanity brought from her a few words of re gret but nothing could mar the good womans complacency over the prospect of an early arrival home with a quarterly share of the treasure
the effect of the tragedy on the four mutinous men forward was most marked
their sullen ness vanished by degrees
they had come to realize that there was nothing in the ten boxes for them and i soothed their regrets by an offer of double pay all around
a few days after captain death i called a conference in the cabin a second confer ence of the four
one of the teakwood boxes had been opened by the skipper and vandeleur and a little mound of its contents was heaped on the cabin table
the mound consisted of metallic fragments roughly hacked from some parent mass and showing ax and pickmarks
there was little in a casual survey of the fragments to suggest value
every piece was stained and discolored and in some of them were embedded particles of broken stone
a a to four is that all we get for our trouble muttered mrs brackett surveying the heap dejectedly
i took up one of the fragments and cut into it with a knife
it cut easily and the passing of the knifeblade left a glittering surface streaked with yellow and gray
unless i am greatly mistaken mrs brack ett i remarked each of these fragments con sists of silver and gold in a marvelously pure state
by some means perhaps by the action of volcanic fires the metal has been melted and run together
there are ten boxes of this rich con glomerate remember and each box weighs a hundred and fifty pounds
in other words we have some fifteen hundred pounds of gold and silver in nearly a pure state
as a mere guess i should say that each box contains treasure to the amount of thirty thousand dollars gasped mrs brackett simply a guess
we donot know the proportion of silver to gold nor how much must be taken from the weight for foreign matter em bedded in the molten metal
but i am of opin ion that the figure stated is most conservative
a a to four mrs brackett struggled for a while to com prehend the enormity of our good luck
vande leur sitting at one side of the table kept his head down and his eyes averted
zelda sitting at my right was calmness itself
mr lorry where did it all come from i won der
mrs brackett her mind floundering help lessly in a mire of undreamedof riches reached after their origin as a measure of relief
that is something aunt sarah said zelda that we shall probably never know
well anyway weve got a good right to the treasure bristled mrs brackett as though by her vehemence to quiet the still small voice of conscience
when i think of my poor boy lyin back there on that rocky island i donot feel that there is enough money in this world to make up his loss to me got a right to it i know we have
certainly we have affirmed zelda
we should not have been sent for the treasure if we hadnot a right to it
by jove chimed in the thin voice of vande leur ours no matter where it came from have an idea i theorized that the treasure a a to was found somewhere on the island
the very name of the island no doubt given to it by our relatives would seem to point to that fact
then again fortune island is of volcanic origin
somewhere about it this molten metal may have been found
i am not enough of a metallurgist to know whether a mine of silver and gold could exist in such a condition as we see these frag ments yet that is the only explanation i can offer
in the absence of anything more definite rob ert said zelda it is the explanation we shall accept
i was made custodian of the boxes by mrs brackett and zelda even vandeleur assenting to the arrangement
upon reaching san fran cisco i was to turn the treasure into money and parcel it out in quarterly shares
a day or two later i had a talk with vande leur forcing him to a full and complete confes sion of his doubledealing
he had hired the two beachcombers to lay for me the night i went to logy just as i had supposed
when they reported their failure to him on the same night the attack was made they like a a ter to four wise brought the news that i had gone to logy bill to secure his help in putting me on the track of a reliable skipper
vandeleur knew of captain golden through captain trent
armed with the information brought by the hired footpads vandeleur called on captain golden told him some of the facts in the case and suggested that he approach logy bill in a cautious way and see if bill would not refer him to me
that is exactly what happened
all our subse quent troubles were due to logy failure to make sure of his man
as soon as it became certain that captain gold en was to take our expedition seaward he and vandeleur began to plan
they finally decided that it would be best to wait until our destina tion was known then put me out of the way as a troublesome menace to the success of their schemes
after the failure of the attempt to get me over board in the southeaster the ludicrous rivalry between the skipper and vandeleur for favor caused a coolness between the conspirators and i was let alone
captain golden overheard a a to four zelda telling me that her object in making her self agreeable to the skipper and vandeleur was solely to insure my safety and the rivals imme diately became reconciled and agreed to continue their nefarious work
the blow i had given the skipper on the beach of the lagoon inspired him to go ashore with vandeleur for the purpose of seeking vengeance
their discoveries at the eastern end of the island followed and they believed they had done their worst when the rope was tossed from the cliff
returning to the schooner golden ordered away the three boats and went to the cavern
if i had been there vandeleur assured me i would never have left the cavern alive
golden and vandeleur positive that the cav ern had something to do with our secret mission to the island searched it carefully and of course found the ten boxes
when they weighed anchor and left the island captain golden intended to make port somewhere in south america dispose of the schooner turn the treasure into negotiable funds divide with vandeleur and then he and vandeleur would lose themselves in distant parts to enjoy their illgotten gains
a a ter to four in making his confession vandeleur was very careful to shield himself at the expense of the dead skipper
vandeleur to take his word for it was always the one who was led always the one who deprecated violent measures
yet i knew the part he had played as well as though he had told it and his desire to shirk responsibili ties served merely to increase my contempt for him
we were more than a month getting back to san francisco
as soon as we had effected a landing a cab was called and mrs brackett and zelda proceeded at once to our old lodgings in kearney street
i remained overnight in the schooner with stubbs and on the following morning hired a dray and accompanied the ten cases personally to the morgan smelting and refining company
here the bullion was weighed and a receipt given me in the name of brackett anstruther vande leur and lorry
two days afterward i called for my statement and check
there was a ripple of excitement in the office of the smelting company when i pre a arter to four sented myself and i was requested to step into mr office for a private interview
a spasm of doubt seized me and i began to have vague fears for the outcome
mr morgan was a stout man with sharp commercial eyes
my appearance i believe was respectable enough but i am very sure that i did not look like the honest custodian of the treasure deposited two days before
mr morgan had a memoran dum of the bullion and a certified check before him
you will pardon me for making some in quiries i trust said he but the large amount of gold and silver which you left with us and the peculiar condition in which we found it impel me to ask you a few questions mr lorry shall be glad to give you any information you may desire i answered
could you send for the other parties who are interested with you in this matter
certainly if you wish it
a boy was sent out to secure a cab and pro ceed to the house in kearney street with a note for zelda
in half an hour the cab had returned a a ter to and mrs brackett zelda and vandeleur were with me in mr office
during our wait for my three companions i had ample time to observe the suspicion with which mr morgan regarded me and when zelda and mrs brackett entered i saw the suspicion slowly leave his face
have you any objection to telling me where this large amount of gold and silver came from inquired mr morgan
i nodded to zelda
will you satisfy his curiosity miss an struther
i asked
tell him everything
i have an idea that mr morgan looks upon us as freebooters and for one should like to have him entirely satisfied
zelda launched into the story forthwith be ginning with the quartered card of instructions mentioning our interview with mr price and following the narrative through to our landing in san francisco
of course she mentioned only those matters that had to do with the treasure leaving out all incidental matters
mr morgan excused himself went into an other room and we could hear him calling up mr
a a ter to four price
presently mr morgan returned smiling and perfectly satisfied
your narrative miss anstruther said he resuming his chair sounds like a tale from the thousand and one nights
i wish to congratu late all of you and here he swept the four of us with a comprehensive glance on your cour age in following a very strange affair through to a successful and highly profitable conclusion find he continued consulting the memo randum before him that mr lorry deposited with us for your joint account ounces of precious metal
of this amount ounces is gold and ounces silver both of an exceed ingly high degree of fineness
the gold amounts to and the silver to making a total of for which i now hand mr lorry our certified check
allow me to congratulate you again on your good fortune and to bid you a good morning
it required zelda on one side and myself on the other to support mrs brackett back to the waiting cab
you will have more than seventy thousand dollars for your share aunt sarah zelda had a a ter to four whispered and mrs brackett was continually mumbling the amount over to herself
from the office of the smelting company we drove to the bank on which the certified check was drawn
there we wrote our names on the back of the check exchanging it for four drafts each for the sum of seventytwo thousand two hundred and five dollars and thirty cents
we have still to reimburse mr lorry said zelda if each of us gave him twelve hundred dollars sy send him my check said vandeleur airily
this happened more than a year ago and van deleurs check is still on the way
dight breaks
settlement for the use of the schooner was made with job golden a shipchandler and a brother of captain nathan
no complaints were lodged against the hands
they received their wages from job golden together with a similar amount from me for i had promised them double pay shortly after leaving fortune island
with the consent of mrs brackett and zelda a bonus of one thousand dollars was given the mate and five hundred dollars each was given anderson and larsen as a gratuity
had these three not served us so well the entire treasure would probably have escaped us
the extra money came at a particularly oppor tune time for mr stubbs inasmuch as job gold en was harassing him with threats on the score of the dead skipper
i suggested to mr stubbs that he spend a little of his bonus for a lawyers services and sent him to mr price
mr price sent the shipchandler a call to come a a ter to to his office
when mr golden came he faced a counterthreat for damages if he persisted in maligning mr stubbs
thereupon mr golden dropped the matter
mrs brackett did not remain long in san francisco after obtaining her share of the treas ure
at her urgent request zelda accompanied her to emmetsburg for a visit of several weeks
before zelda and mrs brackett left i asked zelda the most momentous question of my life prefacing it with a brief account of my career as a soldier of fortune
during my clash with van deleur in the cabin of the lady may at the time the envelopes were opened he had made a slur ring attack upon my character
i wanted zelda to know everything before she gave me her an she smiled as i offered my reasons for going into the recital of my past
that was entirely unnecessary robert said she
when two persons have been together so long and have faced so many dangers side by side as we have they come to know each other pretty well i think
your answer dearest
i asked eagerly
a a ter to four thought i gave it to you weeks ago when we took that walk up the valley from the cliff to the cabin
so she had but loverlike i felt that the sweet est story ever told could not be told too often even if its depth and intensity proved the despair of words
so she gave me her answer again and while i was sealing the compact with a kiss mrs brack ett came into the hotel parlorand stood aghast
rosy and brighteyed zelda flew to her put her arms about her neck and told her the secret our secret
and poor mrs brackett avowed that she had never dreamed of such a thing
nothing would do then but that i should come to emmetsburg in the course of a month so that zelda and i might honor her home with our nup tials
it will be clear of that mortgage by then my dear asserted mrs brackett and if there is anything in omens you and mr lorry will be blessed with a good one
san francisco seemed dreary indeed after zel da had left but i tried to keep busy
after nearly nine years of profitless roaming i at last had a a to four money to invest and with mr help i was able to invest it safely and well
i saw nothing of vandeleur but i heard that he was to use a slang term flying high and burning the candle at both ends in the attempt to get rid of his money
after three weeks of san francisco i began making preparations to leave for emmetsburg
and then on the very morning of the day i had planned to start a hasty summons reached me from mr price
i was to call at his office imme diately
wondering what could be in the wind i hur ried to answer his request
mr lorry said he after we were both com fortably seated in his private office am now at liberty to tell you more regarding your recent highly successful expedition to fortune island
at liberty
i repeated bewildered
exactly that
i was bound by a promise up till this very morning
not that i know anything worth while he put in hastily or anything which if told would have helped you materially in your work
what i have to say is merely by way of explanation
a a to ur several months ago i was sent for by a pa tient in st hospital
i found this pa tient to be a man who had been badly hurt and was slowly dying from the effects of his injuries
he might live a week the doctor said or he might drag out a miserable existence for a year but his end was sure to come
this man gave me four sealed unaddressed envelopes together with eleven hundred dollars in cash
he told me that one hundred and fifty dollars of the money was to be my fee for doing certain things which he would stipulate
the four envelopes were to be given or for warded to four different people who lived in various parts of the country
the addresses of two of those people were known and the ad dresses of the other two were to be found
the names the man gave me were yours mrs miss and mr vande leurs
where mrs brackett and miss an struther were to be found he knew
he also knew that vandeleur lived somewhere in san francisco but of your whereabouts he was en tirely ignorant
vandeleur was easily discovered and a letter a a ter to our to your uncle rufus in great barrington massachusetts developed the fact that you were in chicago
there were certain questions to be answered by all of you in order that identity might be proved beyond all peradventure
the man in the hospital had these questions written out on separate sheets of paper together with the correct answers
he impressed me with the fact that fortunes were waiting somewhere in the pacific for the four whose names he had given me and that to find the whereabouts of the fortunes the contents of all the envelopes would be needed
my task was to see that the envelopes reached the proper parties
my client suggested that i work through lawyers in various parts of the country and i was to forward with each en velope the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars in cash
out of this amount the several lawyers were to keep fees of fifty dollars each the re mainder being turned over to the person the law yer was to communicate with
the fact that my client was in san francisco was to be kept a secret as well as was everything else except the details that had to do with the a a to coming together of the four and the beginning of their enterprise
my client it was who offered the suggestion that the four make themselves known to each other by the mystical formula that concerned the time of day
this said my client will not only prick their curiosity when a bare statement of what they were to do might fail but it will also give them a fitting idea of the caution necessary to the success of their undertaking
personally i think that my client was logical and entirely human nature is a queer thing mr lorry
this client of mine is a good judge of human na ture and he had worked out every detail of his plan while lying on his back in the hospital ward
but this client of yours mr price i broke in if he knew of this treasure why did he allow it to go out of his hands
as i have already said he has been bedridden for months and slowly dying
fate denied him an active part in seeking the treasure and what good could the treasure do him when his doom was sealed and merely a matter of weeks or months
besides he assured me that he was a a ter to bound by a solemn promise a promise given to the dying
what he hoped to accomplish was the recovery of the treasure by those entitled to it and to so plan that not one of the four if so dis posed could take unfair advantage of the others
mr price got up from his chair
you now understand the preliminary details mr lorry said he and if you will accompany me to the hospital you will learn whatever else is necessary to make the whole matter clear
i was now at the end of the mystery and i had discovered that the end of it did not lie in faraway fortune island but right there in san francisco
mr price had a carriage waiting at the curb
we entered it and were soon at st hospital
an attendant who had seemingly been ap prised of our intended visit met us in the office led us to an elevator and to a private ward on the third floor
he tapped on the door and a whitecapped nurse answered the summons
mr lorry i heard the attendant whisper to the nurse
in a moment the latter answered and went back into the room
a a ter to four presently the nurse returned
he wishes to see mr lorry alone said she
just go right in sir she added to me
thrilled with all this mystery supposedly sur rounding the clearing of the great puzzle
i passed into the white highwalled room
the door closed behind me
on a white iron bed in the center of the room lay a man whose thin face was like chalk and whose black burning eyes seemed abnormally large
a slight smile crossed the cadaverous face and gave a ghastly twist to the bloodless lips
a clawlike hand was lifted and held toward me
bob exclaimed a weak voice
i stared stepped forward and grasped the cold hand and stared again
arthur
i exclaimed
arthur mayhew
a lifted veil didnot think youd know me old chap said a bit changed since you saw me last
draw up a chair by the bed
my voice isnot any too strong and got a lot to say
vividly impressed by the difference between the roistering harumscarum lad i had known years ago and the wreck that now lay before me i pulled a chair close and sat down
for a few moments arthur lay quiet staring at me intently
your mother and mine were sisters bob he murmured and if they had not died so soon per haps you and i would have been different
who knows
i never was so bad as your uncle rufus chose to think me he added with another of his ghastly smiles so when i couple your lot in life with my own it is not in an evil way
soldiers of fortune
his smile became a husky laugh am dying early donot you think
perhaps it isnot so bad as all that am halfdead alreadyfrom my waist down
a arter to four in a few days the doctor says my heart will be involved
unknown
i shall pass into the undiscovered country with a better con science now that i know a solemn promise has been fulfilled and that i have been the means of bringing wealth to four who deserve and are en titled to it
he paused
hand me a glass of water bob he said abruptly
my throat is as dry as a bone
i gave him the water and he rested for a min ute
you did the business all right he smiled
price told me
how much did it weigh out
i told him
good he exclaimed was able to bring a little with me when i left the islandenough to see me through this hospital experience and to hand around something for lawyers fees and to give you four a limited amount for traveling ex penses
and i say bob
what is it arthur
his flaming eyes danced with a suggestion of their merry boyish twinkle
what time is it he asked
a a to four i looked around for a clock and again he laughed huskily thought you would tell me a quarter to four he went on
have you so soon forgot ten or didnot it make the impression on you i thought it would
certainly it impressed me strongly enough
but why didnot you have me come right here and tell me the whole business
that would have been the sensible way to get at the thing ar thur
you donot understand bob he answered ear nestly was bound by a promise
i could not even seem to give you an advantage over the other four
but you know i am hones tush boy
of course i know you are honest
to tell the truth i didnot want to talk with you before you crossed the water for that treasure
i was afraid youd find out too much about it you have such a keen way with you and would not go after it
i started as though stung the treasure honestly come by
i de manded
a a to four my three dead comrades are lying in fortune island said he giving me a steady look
be fore i closed their eyes i promised each one of them that the person he named should have a rightful share in the treasure
when men die they try to go with clear consciences even as i am trying
is it likely bob that they and i would want you to go after treasure that was not honestly come by
the point hinges on your personal interpreta tion of right and wrong
i know that i am right and you must acknowledge that you feel in the same way before you leave this room or i shall die plagued with the thought that i have been a curse instead of a benefit to you
go on arthur i urged strangely thrilled thought you got that silver and gold from somewhere about the island
we didnot he burst out vehemently
it came from the mint at tientsin
from the mint at tientsin
i gasped
by fortune of war arthur resumed still ve hemently
are you a soldier of fortune that you should balk at what comes to you by fortune of war
nonsense bob
listen a a to the old ninth did itself proud on that hot july day when we rushed the chinks blew up the wall and marched into the town
we went into quarters at the arsenal and all the soldiers were mad for loot
and it wasnot the foreign soldiers only for the chinks themselves had the biggest finger in the pie
for three days it went on chinks japs frenchies britishers russians all were at it
everything went
english officers rode through the streets with their horses buried under piles of silks furs and bronzes and soldiers car ried bundles on their bayonet points
raiders plundered the pawnshops and stores and when they came out were held up and the stuff taken away from them
the center of the city was like an anthill kicked open and thousands upon thousands of people were diving into the flames dodging fall ing walls and daring a dozen kinds of death just to get their own rakeoff
if the stuff hadnot been taken it would have burned anyway
the palaces the mints and the pawnshops were the first places to claim attention
as luck would have it tommy brackett archie an a a to four struther and i were in at the pillage of the mint
the building had been burned and the ruined walls and broken floors were plastered and cov ered with melted gold and silver
the heapedup bars of bullion had run together in the intense heat and had then flowed in a rich wave over the floor
hundreds of people were there and every body was helping himself
brackett and i got picks and axes and while we cut and hacked and tore the metal veneer from the floors archie dumped ten cases of am munition down a well and brought in the boxes for us to fill
well we filled em
we had to work like turks to do it but we finished the job and did it well
then we made that deal with gene trent
he had a brigantine off port arthur and he agreed to get the stuff away for an even share
it was taking a big risk for we didnot know a thing about trent and what reports we got of him werenot any too favorable
but it was trent or no one and so we chanced it
he was to get the stuff down the river in a sampan transfer it to a junk and get it aboard the gazelle at port arthur
then the gazelle a a to four was to sail for nagasaki and wait there until we three joined himand he was to wait a year if he had to
my time had nearly expired and so had an struthers
tommy had a couple of years before him and he was wondering how he could slip his hawse without doing anything underhand or unsoldierlike
we three forgot about trent and the boxes in the hot times we had during the march to pekin
archie and i were there when we got our discharges
tommy was there too flat on his back in a heathen temple that had been con verted into a hospital
he had a bullet in him somewhere and had been mentioned for bravery
when archie and i had drawn our travel pay and got our papers we took a wagontrain and went down to tientsin with a squad of dis charged men
the last thing tommy said to us when we left was forget to hang around old nagasaki till i catch up with you
well archie and i got across to nagasaki on a transport betting with each other all the way as to whether trent was there or had slanted away with our plunder
we were a couple of a a to four surprised and delighted travelers i can tell you when we saw the brigantine in the bay and read off the name across her stern
captain trent had had a time of it too for he told us he had to put up a singlehanded fight with the sampanmen in order to get the stuff to the junk and while he was in the junk he had to sleep on the boxes with his guns handy in order to keep the piratical crew from throwing him overboard and appropriating the treasure
we idled away two months at nagasaki wait ing for tommy to come
we had about made up our minds that his wound had got the best of him and that he had been planted somewhere in side the walled city when lo and behold along he comesa little peaked and pale but spry as a cricket desert did you tommy
anstruther asked
desert says tommy with fine scorn not me for all the gold in i tell you theres a power of it
invalided home thats mhat i am
now lets sail in a hurry to get back to emmetsburg lift the mortgage on the old homestead like the hero in the play and then a a to four be a dutiful son to one o the best mothers that ever lived arthur had rushed on with his account his words fairly tripping over themselves
he paused suddenly asked for another drink and stared hard at me over the top of the glass
what do you think of it bob he asked handing the glass back donot know what to think arthur said i gloomily looked for a surprise but not for anything like this havenot a hairtrigger conscience as they call it arthur proceeded but i donot think any one can complain that i never tried to do whats right given months of study to this thing studied it from the point of right and wrong between men and between man and his maker and i decided long ago that the treasure was rightfully ours
if we hadnot taken it some one else would
and wheres the wrong of taking a thing thats bound to be taken anyway and from a people that didnot deserve to have it in the first place
i remained silent
well said arthur go on
the gazelle a a to four sailed for san francisco
for weeks everything went well and then one night we tried to sail across a reef and into an island that wasnot on the chart
it was blowing hard at the time and the brigantine went headon with a smash that broke her down clear to the foremast
the sailors in the were drowned like rats in a trap and those on deck were washed overboard
trent brackett anstruther and i were be low in the after cabin and we crawled up on deck as quick as we could and tried to get a whaleboat into the water
a wave stove her in against the side of the wreck and every one of us got hurt whats doing the trick for me now bob
i was hurt internally somehow and the trouble never took form until after i was picked off the island by a tramp sealer and had started for home
we were a quartet of cripples after that and it was the hardest kind of work getting to land
i was thrown into the water and got ashore by swimming trent and the other two followed in the dory
we ere on the island two monthsthat is i a a to four was for my comrades began to drop off the sec ond week after we landed
the first week though we all managed to do a fair amount of work
anstruther had a broken arm wound had opened up again so those two buckled in on shore while trent and i ferried back and orth between the beach and the wreck
we brought away canned stuff and other pro visions and brackett and anstruther picked up wreckage on the beach and carried it to the val ley where we built our cabin
we took the gal ley stove and the table from the cabin and but youve seen the layout i guess so youll have a pretty fair idea of what four crippled men ac complished
our hardest job was getting out those ten boxes
man man but trent and i sweat blood when we did that
trent had changed the stuff from the ammunitioncases to the teakwood boxes at nagasaki
somehow trent couldnot bear the look of those united states army am munitioncases
we had found that cave while snooping around the island in the dory and trent thought it would be safer to dump the boxes on the beach a a to four inside the cave then if any boat happened along and picked us up there wouldnot be any disagree able questions asked
if the rescuer looked like a pretty decent white man wed trust him to help us get the boxes if he didnot wed leave the boxes where they were and come back after them
so we labored like galleyslaves getting the treasure out of the wreck and into the dory and out of the dory and into the cave
after that first week we all got together in the cabin wed built and the gloom had settled over us thick
we hadnot a notion that any of us would ever live to get away but we each gave information about our next of kin along with other needful details and it was written down and solemn promises were made to do the right thing
brackett poor chap was the first be alive today but for that bullet the boxers threw into him
his hardships at the time the brigan tine was wrecked opened up the wound and we couldnot do anything
he flickered out during the night and we found him cold and stiff next morning with his mothers picture gripped in his fingers
we buried him picture and all alongside the a a to four grave of some of the sailors wed picked up on the sand
then i began getting out headboards and put in my spare time carving them
gruesome work
it was worse than that bob
here wed been soldierin in the philip pines and china counting the hours until we were to get back to country only to wind up on that miserable rock in the pacific and begin end ing our days
anstruther followed brackett
nostalgiai think the doctors call itgot in its work and helped his injuries along
he died during the third week
trent was tough and he hung on longer than i had supposed was possible for any human be ing hurt as he was
he left me in the sixth week and there i was all alone on the island manufacturing headboards
trent before he died had taken the islands bearings and i had them down on a piece of paper along with the other information the rest of the lads had given me
also i had some of the treasure in a dunnagebag i had taken it out as a sort of sample and the survivor was to have a arter to four it for expenses in starting an expedition back to the island for the teakwood boxes
it was a godsend for me that that tramp sealer put in at the island two weeks after trent died
if it hadnot surely have gone mad with the loneliness
the captain of the sealer wasnot the sort of man i wanted to trust with the ten boxes so i didnot say anything to him about them
later though when this paralysis began creeping over me i wished i had
i might have taken a chance on him i thought just as we had taken one on captain trent
when the sealer reached frisco they had to send for an ambulance to get me to the hospital
i considered myself lucky to get back to the united states alive
but months have slipped away since then and here i am yet at that moment the door opened and the nurse came in
you are talking too long mr may hew said she decisively
but i want to hear what bob did and mr lorry will have to put that off until to morrow
a arter to four cometomorrow tell me what you think
arthur was very weak and it was difficult for him to speak
study it over tonight bob he added and tell me what you thinkwhen you cometomorrow
conclusion
loot
loot from the pillaged city of tien tsin
how that thought rang in my brain as i walked away from the hospital
and again and again my conscience asked what shall i do
what is it right to do
i thought of what that treasure meant to mrs brackett widowed and childless of what it meant to zelda and what to me
i turned the problem over in my mind a thousand times and i could come to no decision
if i halfdecided that it was right to keep the treasure then arose and grinned mockingly in my face if i halfdecided that it was not right to keep it then face haunted me and fancy flew across leagues of heaving pacific to a lonely island with four stark headboards and beside one of the mounds mrs brackett was kneeling and over another bent zelda anstruther
a a to four i went to the hospital undecided
i went away awed impressed sorrowful
arthur was dead
i had seen the screen pulled around his cot and the nurse had led me behind it and i had stood hat in hand looking down on my cousins calm untroubled face
his last words were for you mr lorry said the nurse
what were they
i asked
they were do not understand them but i presume they will be clear to you tell my cousin bob to keep what he has and say noth ing if not for his own sake then for the sake of the others
you know what he meant mr lorry
yes i answered huskily and turned away
arthur had died fearless in the conviction that it was right for us to keep the treasure
after i had laid arthur away i called upon mr price
behind the closed door of his private room i repeated story as faithfully as memory would allow
then i asked for his ad vice
the lawyer lighted a cigar
anstruther and your cousin arthur may a a ter to our hew said he as i thought irrelevantly must have seen some hard fighting in china suppose so said if there was any hard fighting and arthur could get in it thered be no holding him back
but what has that to do with the question mr price
he did not seem to hear my question
and tom brackett he went on was badly wounded and mentioned for bravery
yes i answered growing more and more perplexed
and you had an uncle killed in the uprising
why yes but mr price wait a minute lorry he interrupted
as near as i can figure it out china owes you and miss anstruther and mrs brackett something on account
vandeleur it strikes me is about the only one whos getting something hes not en titled tobut then we havenot any means of knowing what captain trent did for or against the chinamen
i can see by your face that you think this a specious argument lorry
but i donot know
your cousins last words to you seem to strike a telling note
the lawyer puffed at his cigar in silence for a a a to four few moments and then once more picked up the thread of his remarks
do you want to talk about this thing lorry and get mrs brackett so harrowed up that shell return every stiver of her share to the boxers
do you want some country skinflint to foreclose on that mortgage and turn the old lady out of house and home
or on the other hand are you willing to tuck your sentiment in your pocket and let tom mother keep a roof over her head and live in peace and plenty all the rest of her days
i was silent
and miss anstruther continued mr price
she has a young brother to look after hasnot she
tell her what you know and i imagine archibald anstruther out there on that un charted island in the pacific would turn in his grave
as for vandeleur how much talking do you think it would take to make him give up what hes got
there was nothing i could say and i continued to sit quietly and wait for more light
leaning back in his chair mr price reflected deeply until he had smoked the cigar to his lips
a arter to four then he tossed aside the remains of it got up and stood before me appreciate your feelings in the matter mr lorry said he and they are infinitely to your credit
i am sixty years old my boy and i con sider myself a good american and i have tried to be a just man always in spite of the fact that lawyers are popularly supposed sometimes to be paid for their principles
my judgment is this the matter has passed from national to one of mere individual importance
possession is nine points of the law and you have possession
fol low the line of least resistance and peace go with you
so i pocketed my conscience and followed the line of least resistance but real substantial peace was never wholly mine until a few days ago
a year passed and during all that time i had not breathed a word of story to any one except mr price and i had begun to feel that it was about time i made a confidante of mrs lorry
so i told her
during that year my affairs had prospered amazingly
the oro group of mines in colo a a to four rado had developed into a second comstock lode
by advice of mr price i had purchased half the stock of the oro company investing most of my own funds and the company had recently disposed of its hold ings to an english syndicate and my profits and were such as to make that entire fortune island treasure look very small indeed by com parison
mrs lorry received my account of the source of the island treasure with an equanimity that surprised me am glad that you told me dear was all she said
a week later she came to me and smilingly proffered a request for a check forewarning me at the same time that it was to be quite a large one and stating that i was not to know the dis bursement of the funds
how much is it for dear
i asked whirling my chair around to my studytable opening my checkbook and picking up a pen
she laid a slip of paper on the table before me
the amount penciled on the slip was 4io60 i dropped the pen and fell back in my chair with a gasp
a a to our you spare it dear
zelda asked
why of course butbut she put one arm about my neck and laid her soft cheek against mine
then why donot you write it she asked
i wrote it
next day a thought came to me and i did a little figuring
that island treasure had yielded each of the four the sum of twice this amount gave for a product the face of the check i had written for zelda
what she did with the money i donot know but my conscience has been easier ever since
