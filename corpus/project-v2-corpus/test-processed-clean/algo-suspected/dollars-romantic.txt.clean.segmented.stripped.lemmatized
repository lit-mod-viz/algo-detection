uncle wesley plunkett be a tightwad and know how to hang on to -PRON- money 
uncle wes have never lose any sleep worry about -PRON- nephew so the nephew could hardly be blame if -PRON- have no hard and fast apprehension regard uncle wes 
nevertheless whipple have a warm and sympathetic heart 
if -PRON- have really think -PRON- uncle be critically ill -PRON- would not have come singe into town that afternoon and -PRON- would not have plan -PRON- program of innocent pleasure with such joyous abandon

report to -PRON- often in person or by letter -PRON- see fm aimin to spend -PRON- last day enjoyin -PRON- experience 
i never be able to get any fun out of the money -PRON- so fm plannin to take -PRON- fun secondhand 
make -PRON- snappy and if -PRON- throw in a few thrill -PRON- will oblige 
when a man be packin for -PRON- trip across the great divide same as -PRON- a leetle excitement will make -PRON- forget the trip ahead of -PRON- and be as -PRON- may say soothin 
as fm prepare to lay down life i want -PRON- to pick -PRON- up real life mind the kind miss 
i faintly somewhere within the confine of the board house there sound the musical note of a triangle 
uncle wes stir restlessly go the supper call -PRON- say 
hopper charge four bit a meal for transient like right well to have -PRON- stay and eat with -PRON- but fm short four bit in change 
if -PRON- happen to have -PRON- havenot a red uncle wes put in whipple but -PRON- credit be good at the fordham 
-PRON- credit ought to be good anywhere with that paper i just give -PRON- but the bank be closed and hopper want cash on the nail 
maybe -PRON- would better go to the fordham when the bank open -PRON- can begin to step high wide and handsome 
i only wish i be able to trot along with -PRON- but -PRON- all i can do to walk from this porch to the dinin room 
this heart of mine wonot let -PRON- exercise 
help -PRON- downstairs and then -PRON- can go to -PRON- hotel and plan -PRON- campaign 
if -PRON- put away a dollar of that money where -PRON- bring any interest remember -PRON- be do 
whipple catch -PRON- breath once more 
-PRON- be hardly able to realize -PRON- good fortune 
as one in a wake dream -PRON- help uncle wes out of the canvas chair into the board house and down the stair to the door of the dining room 
there -PRON- thank -PRON- mechanically leave -PRON- and drift out into the bright beautiful afternoon 
one hundred thousand dollar all -PRON- own 
whipple be so daze by -PRON- all that -PRON- barely miss be run down by a street car in washington street 
a whipple come into the lobby of the hotel fordham five man arise from -PRON- chair and advanced upon -PRON- 
-PRON- have learn -PRON- be in town and each have a bill 
one hundred dollar would pay every cent that whipple owe and while that be a large amount to an amalgamator earn thirty a week and with a thousand way in which to lay out that meager stipend -PRON- be a mere bagatelle to a young croesus upon whom have devolve the pleasant duty of spend more than three thousand dollar a day for thirty day 
whipple drop into a chair while -PRON- creditor surround -PRON- and hold out -PRON- statement of account 
sway by a spirit of mischief whipple mutely pull -PRON- pocket inside out 
gentleman -PRON- say come into town with thirty dollar and -PRON- be all go 
five face grow very long and then come some peppery comment 
whipple allow this to continue until -PRON- get on -PRON- nerve then with a flourish -PRON- bring out -PRON- certify check and hold -PRON- under five pair of pop eye 
however -PRON- go on tomorrow as soon as the bank open i shall have the money 
spread the good news that monte cristo junior will be at hotel fordham at eleven oclock tomorrow morning load to the guard with mazuma and ready to meet all comer with a claim on -PRON- 
money have a magic touch 
long face broadened and sour look fade into genial smile 
the man the haberdasher the jeweler who have overhaul watch 
coffee of the shortorder cafe and the garage proprietor with a bill for taxi all these nearly smother whipple with -PRON- kindly attention 
one hundred thousand dollar 
the good will mount in a direct ratio with the size of the check reach height that whipple find rather annoying 
-PRON- be know to be a good spender whenever -PRON- have the cash or if -PRON- do not have the ready money wherever -PRON- credit be good 
but the limit of cash and credit for a amalgamator be modest 
the wealthy wesley plunkett because of -PRON- know character as a tightwad never have influence the merchant in put whipple on -PRON- book 
now that have loosen in such a royal manner however every tradesman have cheerful glimpse of the nephew in the role of a princely spendthrift and -PRON- begin lay -PRON- plan accordingly 
wrench -PRON- clear of the enthusiastic group whipple go in to dinner 
every one even the waiter have a smile and a nod for -PRON- 
news of the cleck be travel like wildfire 
-PRON- hardly seem possible that old plunk have reverse -PRON- so magnificently but every one who smile and nod have see some one who have see somebody else who have feast -PRON- eye on that oblong square of negotiable certify paper 
so the check be a fact and the quick way to get a little of money be to be on a friendly footing with lucky nephew 
later in the evening whipple find time to do a little sober thinking 
in order to be completely strap by next may fourteenth -PRON- would be necessary for -PRON- to spend three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollar every day 
and -PRON- could make no investment all the money would have to go for a good time a period of pleasure snappy and full of thrill if the approval of uncle wes be to be win 
the problem when consider at some length give whipple a sink sensation 
on one evening the previous fall -PRON- have spend fifteen dollar and forty cent 
this madden round of pleasure have include taxicab hire a picture show a dance and then a little supper and katie mingo have be -PRON- companion 
-PRON- have give that jamboree all the trimming -PRON- could imagine even buy katie a bunch of flower and a box of chocolate 
-PRON- have consider -PRON- a wonderful plunge and -PRON- recall how katie have gently reprove -PRON- for -PRON- extravagance 
but that fifteen forty wasnot a circumstance to the obligation that face -PRON- now 
how in sam hill be -PRON- go to spend more than three thousand dollar a day for the next thirty day 
-PRON- canot be do -PRON- tell -PRON- gloomily 
all the pleasure i know anything about wouldnot cost -PRON- three thousand a month in this man town 
like many another man whipple have often dream of the fun -PRON- would have if some kindhearte genie would toss a million dollar into -PRON- lap 
now face with cold fact -PRON- couldnot devise way and mean for get rid of one tenth of a million 
-PRON- need help 
in a flash of inspiration -PRON- think of concho charley vandeever 
by george that be an idea vandeever be an oldtime friend of and -PRON- proud boast be that -PRON- never have anything more than a stetson on -PRON- mind 
charley van be a cowboy 
an aunt in the east have die and leave -PRON- four thousand dollar 
the moment -PRON- get the money charley van have excuse -PRON- from the ranch and in just ten day -PRON- be back at the tumbling punching cow again flat broke 
that feat of concho have go down in the history of the cattle country as a performance never before equal -PRON- have even be perpetuate in a song entitle charley and the wad that wilt and so have be embalm for all time as a lesson to spendthrift 
as soon as -PRON- could get to a telegraph office whipple send the following message mark -PRON- rush charley vandeevef tumbling ranch prescott arizona 
get to get rid of one hundred thousand dollar in thirty day 
come on and help 
at the rate of four thousand dollar in ten day supreme effort would have amount to only twelve thousand dollar in a month 
if that be the good -PRON- could do then whipple be lean on a broken reed 
nevertheless -PRON- have confidence in charley van 
-PRON- experience would be valuable and there be no tell what prodigal height -PRON- may not attain if back with unlimited fund 
the nimble fancy of a free range would suggest way and mean for pleasure not to be find within the four wall of a gold mill 
two head be well than one in the emergency anyhow and there be nothing in uncle instruction bar an assistant spender 
whipple go to bed that night in a fairly comfortable frame of mind 
next morning at ten oclock -PRON- deposit -PRON- check in a checking account and draw three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollar and thirtyfour cent 
-PRON- would try -PRON- prentice hand at get rid of -PRON- before midnight 
charley van could not possibly connect with the telegram and reach the side of -PRON- hardpressed friend before some time the follow day meanwhile whipple could experiment unaide with -PRON- latent power as a spendthrift 
-PRON- have a chance to begin just as -PRON- turn from the pay teller window 
hello call a voice 
put er there son be trail around for two hour try to find -PRON- 
congratulation a chunky man in a shiny prince albert coat a slouch hat and trouser bag at the knee stand in front of whipple and hold out -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be middleage have gray chin whisker and wear a pair of large tortoiseshell glass 
this person have the look of an amiable owl and -PRON- advance be more than friendly 
doc flickinger exclaim whipple take the hand 
erasmus flickinger by special appointment at cut rate physician in ordinary to that doomed and unhappy man -PRON- uncle 
still cling to hand flickinger pull -PRON- close and whisper in -PRON- ear miss -PRON- but hopper eh

if i hadnot give -PRON- three month -PRON- wouldnot be pull down a hundred thousand a month the source of -PRON- good luck 
ten per cent all right 
-PRON- be bark up the wrong tree flickinger reply whipple coldly not hand anybody an honorarium for give -PRON- uncle bad news 
make -PRON- one per cent then beg flickinger 
all i can pry out of old plunk be fifty cent a call 
even -PRON- up for -PRON- 
just a measly thousand for shake this plum tree for -PRON- 
fifty cent a call be about half a dollar more than -PRON- call be worth 
not a cent flickinger 
this demand of -PRON- be bad than unprofessional -PRON- an attempt holdup 
with that whipple push on out of the bank 
-PRON- have no confidence in erasmus flickinger even though -PRON- have develop some success as a prognosticator in a patient length of day 
-PRON- gorge rise at the brazen demand for a commission on the misfortune of uncle wes but out of -PRON- indignation there come an idea 
make -PRON- way to the telegraph office -PRON- proceed to wire five hundred dollar to doctor mixinger of prescott and request -PRON- immediate attention in the matter of wesley plunkett five hundred dollar plus telegraph toll make cheer inroad upon the necessary disbursement of the day and whipple could not have spend the money for anything that would have contribute more to -PRON- personal pleasure 
on -PRON- way back to the hotel attention be arrest by the fact that all phoenix seem to know of -PRON- good fortune 
somehow -PRON- have get into the morning paper 
-PRON- buy one cross over to the courthouse plaza seat -PRON- on a bench and read the racy account of what must have strike the townspeople as a sevenday wonder 
the heading run whipple from threeply strike -PRON- rich 
young amalgamator at mine ride into phoenix and drop into a fortune 
easy come easy go be the string to -PRON- 
and uncle wes hold the end of the string 
there on -PRON- bench in the plaza whipple lean back in the shade of an oleander and smile a little 
be -PRON- become famous or notorious 
-PRON- wonder and then continue to read wesley whipple more power to -PRON- open hand be say to be a spender 
well have now the chance of a lifetime to prove -PRON- 
-PRON- must spend one hundred thousand dollar a month for the next two month solely for -PRON- own pleasure and without make any investment that may bring money return and then if -PRON- measure up to expectation there will be another hundred thousand dollar for -PRON- to put in the bank and draw on only as -PRON- need -PRON- for living expense 
query will -PRON- develop such prodigal habit during the two month that -PRON- third hundred thousand will take wing and finally leave -PRON- strand in mill with only -PRON- salary as amalgamator for a stake in life 
the experiment will be watch with interest by the many friend of in this town 
-PRON- appear that -PRON- wealthy townsman have discover that -PRON- have only three month to live 
mr as all know be an old prospector of frugal habit who turn up a fortune when -PRON- discover and sell the famous letty lee mine in the harqua hala 
ever since that time ten year ago -PRON- have be in fail health 
-PRON- declare that -PRON- know how to save money but have never acquire the knack of spend -PRON- for -PRON- own comfort and pleasure 
so as -PRON- day draw toward a close -PRON- turn -PRON- wealth over to -PRON- nephew in liberal monthly installment to be spend at the rate of more than three thousand dollar a day in the quest of joy and happiness 
and mr whose eccentricity be well know assert that by this method -PRON- will be secure thrill and excitement by watch -PRON- nephew riot away a fortune must be flat broke at the end of -PRON- thirty day if -PRON- be not the deal be off and -PRON- will not receive the second stake for another jamboree of thirty day 
and -PRON- can not invest in anything that will bring monetary return every red cent -PRON- disburse must go for comfort and pleasure and the question naturally arise how may a man of ingrained habit base upon the spending of a hundred or so a month blossom out as the regal spender of a hundred thousand a month 
-PRON- look easy but be -PRON- as easy as -PRON- look 
-PRON- extend -PRON- condolence to mr and to -PRON- nephew mr whipple also unless -PRON- can prove as the spendthrift day go on that -PRON- be entitle to congratulation 
whipple be laugh at this story in the paper when -PRON- look up to see a young man stand in front of -PRON- 
mr wesley whipple inquire the stranger nick -PRON- be carter wainwright of the ne plus ultra sale company mr whipple get a lot of money to spend and the right way to begin be by buy a ne plus ultra automobile 
-PRON- will set -PRON- back twentyfive hundred dollar but will give -PRON- twentyfive thousand dollar worth of pleasure 
six other automobile salesman be wait for -PRON- at the hotel but i have steal a march on -PRON- by overhaul -PRON- in the plaza 
now the ne plus ultra be the classy car on the market today 
-PRON- come equip with cord tire have all right mr wainwright cut in whipple take one -PRON- charge -PRON- more by throw in a few extra 
possibly 
come over to the salesroom and well fix -PRON- up 
by george enthuse mr wainwright this be the easy and quick sale make since be in the business -PRON- catch -PRON- at what -PRON- call the psychological moment be comment 
-PRON- arise from the bench the salesman hook an arm through -PRON- and -PRON- start for the place where the ne plus ultra be to be have superintendent at the mine have a ne plus ultra car and whipple have a turn for mechanic have repair -PRON- and tinker with -PRON- and drive -PRON- until there be nothing about the ne plus ultra with which -PRON- be not thoroughly familiar 
so -PRON- drive -PRON- shiny new machine back to the fordham and leave -PRON- out in front while -PRON- go into the hotel and become involved in the design of a greedy mob that fill the lobby and have be wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- single out -PRON- creditor and pay -PRON- off 
three gambler lead by montgomery king otherwise monte -PRON- summarily dismiss with the emphatic declaration that -PRON- be out to get a run for -PRON- money and not to enrich the card sharp 
mogollon mike moloney a povertystricken prospector whom h have know for year and who at that moment be particularly down on -PRON- luck -PRON- present with fifty dollar 
four mining broker with good thing in which -PRON- want to interest -PRON- have -PRON- ardor dampen by the statement that -PRON- wasnot allow to invest a point -PRON- would not have miss if -PRON- have read the morning paper carefully 
at noon -PRON- go into the dining room for luncheon thrill and cheer by the fact that in two hour -PRON- have spend more than thirtytwo hundred dollar and have only a trifle of eightyeight dollar and some cent leave 
-PRON- be make good by george 
-PRON- hadnot find -PRON- difficult at all 
by the time -PRON- have finish -PRON- noon meal another crowd have gather in the lobby each member of -PRON- prime with suggestion for help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- hundred thousand 
evade these caller -PRON- dodge out at a side door reach -PRON- wait automobile with a rush and a jump kick at the selfstarter let in the clutch and be off for a ride through the countryside 
the car work like a charm and just to handle the control and realize that everything from the headlight forward to the tail light aft be -PRON- very own cause -PRON- the most delightful sensation 
-PRON- afternoon spin carry -PRON- out along the cave creek road around by the indian school and then back to town again 
if only katie or mamie or lorena have be with -PRON- -PRON- enjoyment would have be complete 
but which one of the three would -PRON- have enjoy most to have along 
ordinarily -PRON- answer would have be katie but pa hard jolt over the phone have rather daze and discourage -PRON- so far as katie be concern 
and mamie philbrick have turn -PRON- down courteously but not with any regret that -PRON- have be able to discover 
miss lorena marlin have be out of town 
in the absence of any disconcert word from miss marlin -PRON- rather guess that -PRON- would have enjoy most -PRON- company on the little afternoon spin 
in the lobby of the fordham the rank of those with design on -PRON- money have be reenforce by several newspaper man who be look for a story 
-PRON- refuse -PRON- to all of -PRON- after felix vannell have catch -PRON- ear and pour into -PRON- the information that three lady be in the parlor upstairs wait to see -PRON- 
the wide door of the parlor hang with portiere open at the head of the first flight 
as whipple come close to one of the swinging curtain a voice that be very familiar strike on -PRON- ear know -PRON- first and -PRON- s -PRON- by the right of discovery 
-PRON- two may as well be on -PRON- way 
that be lorena marlin speaking 
-PRON- gurgle musical voice which have always seem so cute and childlike to whipple have lose some of -PRON- rich cadence and be tinge with temper 
-PRON- stop to debate with -PRON- and more conversation drift out to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have know -PRON- first miss marlin but when -PRON- call up last night and -PRON- have serena haskin tell -PRON- -PRON- be out of town i guess that let -PRON- out 
oh i get wise to that 
wesley will feel fine when -PRON- hear -PRON- be in the board house all the time and didnot want to see -PRON- 
well miss smarty since -PRON- know so much tell -PRON- something that be wise to 
-PRON- phone to -PRON- yesterday didnot -PRON- 
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have another engagement but -PRON- never have any caller and werenot out of the house all evening 
so i guess be even 
whipple be terribly shake by this cross fire between lorena marlin and miss mamie philbrick 
-PRON- have no business stand there and listen to -PRON- but -PRON- could hardly have avoid hearing disclosure 
be these girl like all the other 
have wesley whipple become popular with -PRON- merely because of the hundred thousand dollar 
-PRON- draw out -PRON- handkerchief and pass -PRON- over -PRON- moist brow think -PRON- be just horrid both of -PRON- 
here come a third voice equally familiar to whipple but vastly more pleasing 
katie mingo be speak 
-PRON- tone express indignation and there be nothing in -PRON- of a spiteful quality 
whipple clutch at -PRON- as at a straw of hope 
a mocking laugh greet word horrid be -PRON- return lorena marlin 
well how have -PRON- father be talk about wes whipple these last few week

step lightly -PRON- dear step lightly whipple think -PRON- be high time to appear on the scene 
-PRON- cough fling back -PRON- shoulder and show -PRON- between the portiere 
a cry of delight welcome -PRON- and lorena and mamie spring up from -PRON- chair and hurry forward 
katie remain seat by a window and do not join in the demonstration 
lorena have black hair and black eye and katie have flaxen hair and blue eye while mamie be neither a brunette nor a blonde 
all be lovely of feature and form but a flash of revelation have show whipple that the character of at least two of -PRON- be not so lovely 
-PRON- bow in -PRON- good manner 
congrat wes cry lorena put out -PRON- hand always think -PRON- uncle would do something for -PRON- wes mamie remark and isnot -PRON- fine how be -PRON- make -PRON- make -PRON- fly whipple answer

and here to ask -PRON- to -PRON- house to dinner speak up mamie 
and i be here first wait for -PRON- wes 
but i have know -PRON- longer than any of the other say lorena 
-PRON- werenot out of town last night miss marlin and miss philbrick have no engagement 
whipple could have make these statement of fact very cutting but -PRON- be not in -PRON- to be disagreeable to the lady 
-PRON- smile as -PRON- speak 
so -PRON- go on be sure -PRON- will not be very much disappointed if i tell -PRON- that i have other plan for this evening 
-PRON- walk over to katie 
miss mingo -PRON- inquire why arenot -PRON- congratulate -PRON- think wait answer katie 
the truth be i donot know whether -PRON- be to be congratulate or not 
time will tell about that wes 
if the paper be to be believe the condition under which -PRON- uncle be give -PRON- the money may prove a handicap in the long run 
father want -PRON- to come to dinner at -PRON- house this evening 
then -PRON- have reverse -PRON- 
-PRON- opinion about -PRON- have undergo a change since uncle wes prove so liberal 
mamie and lorena titter fair face flush painfully 
whipple be sorry at once that -PRON- have speak in just that way 
before katie could answer -PRON- go on suppose -PRON- take a ride in -PRON- new car and talk -PRON- over 
just out around camelback mountain get -PRON- home in time for supper 
-PRON- offer -PRON- arm 
katie arise put -PRON- hand through the arm and cross with whipple to the wide doorway 
mamie have lose the power of speech and have drop into a chair 
not so lorena -PRON- seat -PRON- quickly at a piano thrum a few note and begin to sing 
-PRON- voice follow katie and whipple as -PRON- descend the stair katie be wait at the door 
oh dear gasp katie in charming confusion 
never mind say whipple cheerily 
-PRON- be a little hard to find out who -PRON- real friend be sometimes especially -PRON- add when one happen to have a hundred thousand dollar to spend 
that money of uncle be go to prove a great education to -PRON- 
-PRON- have a wonderful ride and not the least wonderful part of -PRON- be explanation of the way -PRON- father have reverse -PRON- sentiment be never -PRON- -PRON- tell whipple earnestly know -PRON- have always think well of -PRON- but -PRON- have have such hard luck all -PRON- life that -PRON- canot bear to see any one squander money 
and -PRON- have be in debt so much -PRON- that -PRON- fill -PRON- with horror to see a young man start life as -PRON- say completely surround with bill 
-PRON- have watch -PRON- carefully for the last three year ever since -PRON- begin call at -PRON- house 
-PRON- -PRON- didnot seem to improve wes and so -PRON- take the stand -PRON- do 
after -PRON- talk with -PRON- i try hard to get -PRON- at the hotel -PRON- but couldnot 
now worried for fear -PRON- will think like lorena and mamie invite -PRON- to dinner because -PRON- have suddenly come into a lot of money 
no katie never think that of -PRON- whipple aver never forget how i spend fifteen dollar and forty cent once and -PRON- call -PRON- down for be so extravagant 
mamie and lorena be always urge -PRON- to go the limit different

-PRON- wish be enough for -PRON- katie 
but like to lavish some of this money on -PRON- if i can to buy happiness with -PRON- and i canot think of any happy way to spend -PRON- than to spend jt with -PRON- do wish -PRON- could save -PRON- we save -PRON- and use -PRON- in get ahead 
-PRON- isnot right to throw away so much money 
-PRON- be almost six oclock when whipple halt the car in front of door let katie out and then drive on toward the hotel 
galusha mingo meet -PRON- daughter as -PRON- enter the house 
-PRON- wouldnot come to dinner -PRON- ask 
no father answer katie brightly 
-PRON- tell -PRON- what i want 
yes -PRON- answer dutifully 
galusha mingo rub -PRON- hand 
then -PRON- have plant the seed and -PRON- will grow and bear flower and fruit -PRON- dear 
-PRON- shall see what -PRON- shall see 
while -PRON- be utter this oraculaf comment whipple be just cross the street car track to drive into a garage 
-PRON- work of driving be purely mechanical for -PRON- thought be all about katie and the delightful two hour -PRON- have just spend with -PRON- 
-PRON- do not hear the jangled warning of an approach street car and the first -PRON- know of -PRON- danger be a tremendous crash 
one side of the ne plus ultra double up and wreck and break -PRON- be roll and push along the track 
whipple -PRON- have be throw through the wind shield by the impact and be lie crumple and unconscious in the street in front of the garage 
-PRON- have all happen so quickly that even the crowd on the sidewalk be slow in realize that there have be an accident 
a awoke to find -PRON- lyvv e on three chair in a drug store 
doc flickinger be bend over -PRON- 
both arm and one foot have be bandage and flickinger be now decorate -PRON- face with courtplaster 
get out -PRON- say to flickinger 
fm all right remark flickinger to the druggist and the druggist two clerk 
as near as i can make out -PRON- s get a compound fracture of the tibia lacerated ligament of both arm and very grave internal injury 
call the ambulance and well send -PRON- to a hospital 
no -PRON- donot cry whipple stay at the fordham and that s where go right now 
with that -PRON- get off the three chair and start for the door 
although -PRON- limp wesley whipple walk remarkably well for a man with a compound fracture of the tibia 
flickinger chase after -PRON- wildly but -PRON- brace -PRON- in the doorway turn and shake a bandaged fist under nose have some internal and external injury -PRON- if -PRON- try to trail after -PRON- -PRON- threaten 
flickinger be intimidate and fall back 
hatless coatless bandage and wear only one shoe whipple turn a corner and walk half a block to the hotel fordham 
the usual crowd of schemer be lie in wait for -PRON- but the sight of whipple in this gruesome condition be discourage and only felix vannell and the chinese bell hop accost -PRON- 
for the love o pete exclaim the clerk the matter accident say whipple but -PRON- isnot as bad as -PRON- look 
want a doctor 
no all i want be to get up to -PRON- room 
the chinaman help -PRON- get -PRON- to -PRON- room on the second floor and would have continue -PRON- ministration have whipple not order -PRON- out 
then whipple lock the door and proceed to remove the bandage 
there be absolutely no need of -PRON- so far as whipple could discover 
the compound fracture and the lacerate ligament so feelingly mention by doc flickinger be wholly imaginary 
whipple kick the bandage into one corner of the room and air -PRON- opinion of flickinger in burn word 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- be shake and bruise and that the glass of the broken wind shield make necessary the three bit of courtplaster that decorate -PRON- face 
aside from this however -PRON- have suffer no injury 
be an athletic person and hard as nail as the saying be -PRON- have come through that accident remarkably well 
a hand try the knob of -PRON- door then the same hand drum a summon on the panel 
-PRON- be vannell and -PRON- bring a coat hat and the miss shoe 
these be just bring to the office -PRON- explain shy fiftyeight dollar and a quarter felix say whipple 
see if -PRON- in the coat 
-PRON- be not in the coat and whipple be force to the conclusion that when -PRON- be throw from the car -PRON- must have empty -PRON- pocket into the street 
-PRON- still have -PRON- watch and chain and the rabbit foot charm and for these and for -PRON- wonderful good luck -PRON- be very thankful 
vannell report that the car be a total wreck that brandnew ne plus ultra which whipple have own and enjoy for only a few fleeting hour 
but the situation have -PRON- amenity 
whipple be clean out of every cent of the money which -PRON- have draw for the day spending 
-PRON- laugh jubilantly while the clerk look on and wonclere if -PRON- be right in -PRON- mind 
in half an hour felix whipple instruct send -PRON- dinner up to -PRON- room the clerk retire and whipple lock -PRON- in again then -PRON- take a hot bath and greatly refresh crawl into bed 
when -PRON- dinner come -PRON- eat with a heartiness that in no way suggest the invalid 
about eight oclock vannell bring -PRON- an evening paper and two telegram 
the clerk be off duty and would have like to sit down and talk but whipple make -PRON- plain that -PRON- be in no mood for company lot of people have call up and ask about -PRON- say vannell galusha mingo among other 
mingo give order that -PRON- be not to be disturb and inform -PRON- that -PRON- be in charge of -PRON- case 
that all right -PRON- be pleasant to know that father be take such an interest in -PRON- 
whipple inform the clerk that -PRON- be all right and be once more left to -PRON- 
one telegram be from doctor mixinger will run down friday and give -PRON- uncle -PRON- good attention 
the other message be from charley van have be send collect and be charge against whipple on the book of the hotel get -PRON- pard go out and take a view of the universe spend a red till i get there and show -PRON- how 
will arrive thursday a m 
whipple go to sleep that night feel splendidly but -PRON- awake next morning lame and sore and with an ache in all -PRON- joint 
-PRON- try to get up and dress but topple back into bed again 
-PRON- be bear in on -PRON- that -PRON- be doom to take a day off and that -PRON- riotous spending would have to be break for a interval 
at the end of that time however charley van would be with -PRON- in person and there would be two head to plan and four hand to scatter the largess of uncle wes 
-PRON- be a quieting thought reflection have mostly to do with katie mingo during that inactive day 
and -PRON- happen to remember that -PRON- father be in need of ten thousand dollar 
-PRON- occur to -PRON- that unknown to katie -PRON- may bestow that amount upon galusha mingo win -PRON- abide friendship and get rid of more than a three day allowance of uncle money 
galusha mingo have study for the law only to find that -PRON- could not earn -PRON- salt as a lawyer 
-PRON- have then give -PRON- attention to assaying and now have a little shop about six door from corral 
the business be not prosperous and mingo have a hard time to get along 
-PRON- be a psychologist and -PRON- bring so much of the shadowy science into -PRON- business affair that possibly the fact account for -PRON- failure 
-PRON- have the faculty nevertheless of see good thing in a business way and if -PRON- have have the fund with which to back up -PRON- analysis of opportunity -PRON- may have be a rich man 
at the present moment -PRON- be very busy with affair and oa wednesday afternoon about three oclock the angle of -PRON- activity be bring very forcibly and not very pleasantly home to the young man in room mr mingo call and with -PRON- there come a little sharpvisaged man who seem deeply interested in the state of health 
mingo introduce -PRON- companion as jule fortheringham a claim agent 
the plunge at once into the business of the interview brandnew automobile be a total wreck 
-PRON- have cost -PRON- just a few hour before the accident something like twentysix hundred dollar 
-PRON- be a miracle as -PRON- may say that whipple -PRON- have not be kill outright 
seemingly -PRON- have come off extraordinarily well 
-PRON- be feel fairly well at the moment and yet who know what may not develop in the day or week to come 
mingo have vision of whipple walk with a cane or a crutch for the rest of -PRON- life 
that be a possibility 
the claim agent recognize the possibility and -PRON- be ready to give a check for five thousand dollar part to reimburse whipple for the loss of the car and the rest to in16 sure the company against any further claim 
but i be all right assert whipple and i donot want to goldbrick anybody 
galusha mingo put up a restraining hand 
whipple think -PRON- be all right but time alone could tell whether -PRON- be or be not 
disease result from the accident may creep into -PRON- system in course of time and put -PRON- completely out of the running 
then again whipple continue to protest pm not so sure that the street car be at fault 
i galusha mingo interrupt hastily to state that there be six eyewitness who would all swear that the street car be at fault 
-PRON- be probable that heredity have less to do with this matter of be square than environment 
the child of the most honest parent in the world will be mar for life if abandon in the tender year to evil surrounding but -PRON- will grow up a credit to those who bear -PRON- if right teaching be sift into -PRON- environment with discrimination and care 
whipple in -PRON- extreme youth have be well ground in proper principle and -PRON- now rebel against the course along which mingo be hurry -PRON- donot care about -PRON- eyewitness -PRON- say know that what happen be due entirely to -PRON- own carelessness 
that settle -PRON- 
jule fortheringham push a bundle of paper with which -PRON- have be busy back into -PRON- pocket 
this frankness be er most unusual where a soulless corporation and easy money be concern -PRON- remark 
who be the old chap who go hunt with a lantern for an honest man 
-PRON- could have find -PRON- prize right here in room the fordham 
-PRON- shake hand with whipple 
son -PRON- go on as -PRON- move to the door and pause there let -PRON- tell -PRON- something -PRON- canot spend or throw away a red cent without make an investment and the return be bind to be make manifest in spite of -PRON- 
just remember that 
galusha mingo to all appearance be bitterly disappointed 
-PRON- turn on whipple the moment -PRON- be alone together and vent -PRON- feeling 
young man -PRON- say angrily -PRON- havenot an idea of the value of money 
if -PRON- ever expect to get marry what business have -PRON- get turn down a chance like that 
less to -PRON- than to the lady who will some day be mrs whipple -PRON- be under an obligation to get ahead 
on the chance that -PRON- little girl may somehow be concern in -PRON- future plan i be try to help -PRON- 
flickinger make out as good a case for -PRON- as -PRON- could -PRON- be to receive ten per cent of the gross and i certainly pull the wire for -PRON- in masterful fashion 
now -PRON- have knock everything into a cocked hat 
-PRON- start for the door 
katie be grieve over this orgy of fool spending mingo go on 
-PRON- be a woman and take to heart more than -PRON- ought to the deliberate manner in which -PRON- be shatter -PRON- future go to send -PRON- to an aunt in los angele so -PRON- wonot be anywhere near this scene of criminal extravagance 
i feel that -PRON- will be good 
-PRON- jerk the door open but before -PRON- could leave whipple stay -PRON- with a word am try to give -PRON- uncle a little excitement and a few thrill in -PRON- last day mr mingo -PRON- explain as the other turn back 
in that desk over in the corner be a check book and pen and ink 
may i trouble -PRON- to bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
mingo obeyed order and whipple write out a check to -PRON- for ten thousand dollar 
katie tell -PRON- yesterday that -PRON- be desperately in need of this amount of money whipple go on as -PRON- pass over the check and i be glad to oblige an old friend 
i would suggest however that -PRON- do not tell katie anything about -PRON- 
-PRON- may not approve 
mingo be touch almost to tear 
til give -PRON- -PRON- note -PRON- say huskily 
if -PRON- do fll tear -PRON- up 
that be a free gift 
i be empower to spend the hundred thousand in way that will bring -PRON- the most pleasure 
look at in such a way if the donation mean anything to -PRON- -PRON- mean infinitely more to -PRON- 
-PRON- whole life turn right at this point continue mingo feelingly on behalf of -PRON- family and -PRON- i thank -PRON- from -PRON- heart 
be -PRON- still of a mind to send katie to los angele 
on second thought return mingo believe leave that move to katie -PRON- 
thursday morning whipple be feel much well 
-PRON- be out of bed by seven and torture -PRON- weary muscle with settingup exercise 
the cold bath and brisk rub down that follow bring a warm glow and a feeling of exhilaration 
the complaint of -PRON- dependable nerve and sinew be very mild indeed and only just enough to remind -PRON- that -PRON- have be in a collision 
the patch of courtplaster of course still remain as souvenir 
-PRON- be busily shave when something like an avalanche bump against -PRON- lock door 
-PRON- open -PRON- and fall into the fond embrace of charley van -PRON- -PRON- old seed whoop the cowboy ready to take -PRON- little hand in -PRON- and go out and put some fancy crimp in the big wad 
thing be gettin so monotonous down at the ranch that life wasnot popular at all 
-PRON- call reach -PRON- at the physicogical moment as the man say

i -PRON- break off abruptly as -PRON- eye happen to cross the veranda rail encounter doc flickinger move on the board house from up the street 
flickinger be come to make -PRON- customary morning call on uncle wes 
the eye of the old prospector narrow and -PRON- face grow hard the cimiroon that do more to make -PRON- waste -PRON- ten year than any one else on earth -PRON- growl reckon due for a little more exercise -PRON- finish and crouch beside the door lead to the secondstory veranda

the latter bounding to -PRON- foot flee for the stair the street and safety 
-PRON- leave -PRON- hat spectacle and -PRON- medicine case behind 
uncle wes fling -PRON- after -PRON- over the railing and the medicine case jingle merrily as -PRON- strike the ground 
what on earth be the matter wailed mrs hopper hysterically 
uncle wes leap into the air and let off a whoop a well man that s what s the matter -PRON- declare come to and get wise to how flickinger be stringin -PRON- along

-PRON- business be to overhaul and recover as much of the money as possible 
dinner be ready by the time uncle wes be ready for the street but delay to eat while be spend with an open hand be out of the question 
uncle wes reason that the faster -PRON- hurry the more of -PRON- good money -PRON- would recover 
the sight of wesley plunkett travel at speed along the street of phoenix cause the oldtimer to rub -PRON- eye and wonder if -PRON- be see thing

-PRON- be an incredible performance for one whose day be say to be number

this be a terrible wrench for uncle wes 
-PRON- stifle a groan 
physically there have be a change in -PRON- a complete transformation but mentally -PRON- be the same old tightwad 
the thought that have already escape and be on -PRON- way to a big and extravagant city where the rest of the hundred thousand would melt away like dew in the morning sun be a blow between the eye 
uncle wes come out of -PRON- daze to inquire wh what train do -PRON- take

then -PRON- think of the bank in which have deposit the money 
on a forlorn chance -PRON- go there and institute inquiry 
-PRON- be inform by the cashier that whipple have draw out all the money in -PRON- account take -PRON- in thousanddollar bill 
when -PRON- leave the bank uncle wes feel like a beaten man 
-PRON- have -PRON- health and -PRON- have a lot of money leave but -PRON- hurt -PRON- to the soul to see the remain of that hundred thousand dollar get away from -PRON- 
back at -PRON- make -PRON- plan to go to los angele by train and be there to meet and vandeever when -PRON- arrive 
hopper however explain to -PRON- that the aeroplane travel so fast that -PRON- would probably be in los angele before uncle wes could get a train out of phoenix 
uncle wes suddenly have an idea 
til send a telegram to the chief of police in los angele -PRON- say and have and vandeever arrest the minute -PRON- come down stop -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot be able to spend any money if -PRON- be in jail 
jest as soon as i learn -PRON- have be arrest go to los angele -PRON- get back what s leave of -PRON- money and tell the police to turn -PRON- loose 
-PRON- go to the courthouse and talk with the sheriff then the sheriff get busy and wire the los angele police department 
follow this there be a period of wait 
feel that -PRON- have make an excellent move uncle wes grow calm 
-PRON- read the paper and learn how accompany by the irrepressible charley vandeever have buy the aeroplane hire the pilot and take flight from the city park 
this sensation divide honor in the daily press with a big bank robbery at eudora arizona in which three bandit have make a daylight raid and escape with sixty thousand dollar in cash and liberty bond 
the bank be offer five thousand dollar for the capture of the robber and ten per cent of all cash and bond recover 
this affair interested uncle wes only because -PRON- claim the attention of the local sheriff and give -PRON- less time to devote to and vandeever 
uncle wes haunt the sheriff office wait for news of the arrest of -PRON- nephew and vandeever and make -PRON- a nuisance 
one day two day pass and still the aeroplane have not reach los angele nor have -PRON- reach any other know port of call east or west north or south 
a deep dark mystery have suddenly fall over that aeroplane 
after leave phoenix -PRON- have neither be sight nor hear of 
probably the opinion run -PRON- have be wreck somewhere on the desert or in the mountain and would never be hear of again 
then on the third day after the fly machine have leave phoenix among the suspicious character bring in by the sheriff and -PRON- posse to be question regard the eudora robbery be a weazelface know to be a side partner of the gambler threecard monte 
-PRON- tell a story after a session of the third degree that let in a flood of light on the spender bind for los angele 
monte -PRON- seem have subsidize the pilot of the aeroplane and win -PRON- consent to land -PRON- passenger on saddleback flat at the edge of the estrella mountain 
this be a lonely hole in the hill inhabit solely by scorpion tarantula and sidewinder 
but the gambler and some of -PRON- friend would be at saddleback flat if not when the aeroplane arrive at least shortly thereafter and -PRON- plan be to annex every dollar carry by and vandeever by fair mean or foul 
the discovery that monte and -PRON- confederate have leave by fast automobile in the general direction of saddleback flat the very morning the aeroplane have hop off corroborate the story tell by the informer 
deputy sheriff start at once for saddleback flat 
-PRON- refuse to let uncle wes ride in -PRON- car but -PRON- enthusiasm for an active role in recover -PRON- money spur -PRON- to hire a flivver and follow on to the flat 
galusha mingo go with -PRON- and although -PRON- be manifestly no work for a woman katie mingo insist on go with -PRON- father 
katie be wild with apprehension over and uncle wes have not the heart to insist that -PRON- stay at home especially since mingo be bear rather more than -PRON- share of the flivver hire 
this second party get away three hour after the deputy sheriff have start all be too late hazarded galusha mingo gloomily 
more than likely monte and -PRON- gang have get the money and be in part unknown by this time have a lesson mourn uncle wes hang on to -PRON- money after this and not fool -PRON- away on a spendthrift nephew 
but oh what do -PRON- suppose have happen to wail katie fret about -PRON- katie say uncle wes with whom girl be a prime favorite be back in gold mill before many day work for thirty a week as usual a after all say and do and nobody ever yet make -PRON- hard to find aeroplane have be name by percival simmon the ace high and since a hand in a poker game with nothing but ace high seldom win simmon name for -PRON- flyer be not much of a recommendation 
neither whipple nor vandeever however draw -PRON- speculation out so fine 
the former pay ten thousand and the latter six thousand and when the ace high hop off at phoenix that bright friday morning -PRON- be -PRON- property and the former owner be on -PRON- pay roll at one hundred dollar a day 
whipple have turn the balance of -PRON- bank account into cash and -PRON- have with -PRON- on take the air in -PRON- fly start for los angele seventyfive bill and a hundred plus in small change 
-PRON- be enough certainly to finance a tolerable round of pleasure for two wandering spendthrift 
the three passenger be distribute in separate cockpit along the backbone of the ace high simmon in front just back of the propeller then whipple and then vandeever 
just before the takeoff whipple have overhear simmon make inquiry about the estrella mountain and saddleback flat 
this strike -PRON- as queer and -PRON- have ask the pilot why -PRON- be so interested in that particular part of the country 
simmon answer that -PRON- merely want to use the mountain and the flat as a landmark while con -PRON- course 
whipple be surprised to discover as soon as -PRON- be in the air that -PRON- be not in the least dizzy 
there be a deafen clamor in -PRON- ear 
this be continuous and make conversation impossible 
and when -PRON- get out from behind -PRON- wind shield to look overside a frightful rush of wind tear the breath out of -PRON- lung 
but there be no unpleasant sensation and all -PRON- doubt about the aeroplane be a good buy be dissipate 
thirty minute after the start a sunbaked wilderness destitute of human life be unroll beneath the ace high at the rate of a hundred mile an hour 
whipple know that a mountainous country lie below but view from overhead -PRON- seem flat and every highflung butte and peak have no more visible elevation than a cactus clump 
simmon keep constant watch presumably look for landmark 
why this be necessary at that stage of the journey be incomprehensible to whipple 
a compass course due west be all that be need 
the pilot theless seem anxious and worried and at last confused 
-PRON- dip lower in order to get a clear view of the country and then -PRON- lift higher circle and cut figure eight mile long twist and turn and fall and rise until whipple lose all sense of direction and could only judge the way -PRON- be travel by take a slant at the sun 
charley van be likewise puzzle by these maneuver 
-PRON- lean over to yell something in ear 
after several attempt -PRON- make -PRON- manifest to whipple that -PRON- do not like the proceeding and that -PRON- be lose time with all those curlicue when -PRON- ought to be whoop -PRON- up on a straightaway course and wouldnot just yell that into simmon ear order -PRON- to point for los angele keep go and oblige 
whipple lean over -PRON- wind shield and shout at the aviator helmete head the joint objection of the two owner of the machine to the man -PRON- have hire to run -PRON- 
simmon answer something but whipple could not understand what -PRON- be 
with one hand on simmon leatherclad shoulder with the other whipple indicate a westerly direction 
the pilot nod nosed the machine skyward and start again on the proper course 
for ten minute everything go beautifully and then all at once the terrific din of the propeller fail in a swift diminuendo 
presently only the screech of the wind could be hear among the taut wire and stay 
there could be talk now that be clearly hear the idee simmon demand charley van 
engine trouble of some kind answer the pilot -PRON- hand pass swiftly over the control dead and i canot get a kick out of -PRON- 
then what inquire whipple with a sink sensation get to volplane down 
look for a place to land both of -PRON- 
if -PRON- canot find the right kind of a place be all do for 
this be pleasant news 
the ace high be corkscrew downward in wide circle and the ground below seem to be jump up at -PRON- greedy for a collision 
with wide fearful eye whipple and vandeever be try to discover a level stretch of ground among the tumbled mountain peak 
can -PRON- see anything of saddleback flat yelled simmon wildly mile to the west of -PRON- flat charley van roar at -PRON- 
the country down there look to -PRON- a heap more like the gila bend divide than the estrella 
oh by glory sim -PRON- have sure get -PRON- all mix up 
hit the flat desert canot -PRON- -PRON- canot hit anything but those peak be the pilot answer -PRON- see anything that look level and smooth down there 
use -PRON- eye 
with sicken rapidity the sawtooth crest of the hill leap at the ace high a canon cry whipple as the fly machine cut across the yawn mountain chasm at perhaps five hundred foot 
and a flat at the bottom of -PRON- add vandeever 
can -PRON- drop into that gash and light on the flat get to answer simmon between -PRON- set tooth if i donot -PRON- all over but payin the bet 
-PRON- manipulate the fall machine in such fashion that the nose of -PRON- be bring in line with the north and south trend of the canon then straighten out the plane rush downward 
-PRON- clear the two steep wall of the gash and by a turn to the left hit the flat with a shock that almost throw whipple and vandeever out of -PRON- cockpit 
the flyer lurch and wabble over the rough ground finally halt with a crash 
whipple take a header into the air land on one of the wing roll down the steep slope of -PRON- and off the end in a sixfoot fall on a nest of bowlder 
there -PRON- curl up quietly and go to sleep 
-PRON- awake to find charley van throwing water in -PRON- face 
how -PRON- feelin inquire the cowboy anxiously good deal like i do when the street car hit -PRON- answer whipple in a faint voice waste all that good water charley give -PRON- a drink 
vandeever limp away bend down over a small stream refill -PRON- stetson and come back this fierce -PRON- comment gloomily as whipple gulp the water over the hat brim reckon this deal be a mistake simmon ask whipple 
who care a hoot about sim snap vandeever 
-PRON- sell -PRON- a sky boat with a bum engine and now see what s happen 
i allow if -PRON- break -PRON- neck -PRON- wouldnot be much moren even 
no such luck come the melancholy voice of the pilot 
-PRON- be sit on a bowlder minus -PRON- helmet and leather jacket and be knot a handkerchief around -PRON- left forearm use -PRON- right hand and -PRON- tooth 
whipple have be drag clear of the rock pile and -PRON- now sit up and take a look around 
-PRON- be at the edge of a flat and the flat be at the bend of the canon 
the wall of the defile be high and straight up and dow merely smooth precipice 
a small stream babble over the rock of -PRON- narrow course and in the sandy stretch be rank growth of mesquite 
the ace high have run head on into the canon east wall 
the lefthand plane have be crumple up by a big cottonwood tree and the front end of the machine have be crush as far back as the pilot cockpit 
simmon surely have be lucky to escape alive 
think -PRON- can fix up the old catamaran sim inquire vandeever 
not hardly be the sarcastic response a total wreck 
landing gear all smash propeller all in piece port plane in smithereen and engine knock into a cocked hat 
when -PRON- get away from here well have to walk 
walk yell the exasperate vandeever 
do -PRON- know what sort of country lie between -PRON- and civilization bout steen hundred mile of desolation with nothing to feed on but chuckwalla and nothing to drink but the juice of niggerhead cactus 
walk 
man -PRON- never could make -PRON- 
if -PRON- old pop bottle have to give out why didnot -PRON- pull the play within hailin distance of phoenix an elegant mess o fish 
whipple get up and balance -PRON- dizzily on -PRON- leg look around and get -PRON- bearing -PRON- suggest something to do anyways vandeever assent 
-PRON- move northward toward the upper end of the canon 
simmon do not go with -PRON- but sit disconsolately on -PRON- bowlder and begin spiritlessly to manufacture a cigarette 
-PRON- donot need to worry a hull lot remark vandeever get -PRON- sixteen thousand so bustin up the ace high donot mean a thing in -PRON- young life 
-PRON- didnot take -PRON- long to get rid o that bunch o money anyways 
plumb waste and nothing to show for -PRON- this be a right discouragin canon if anybody ask -PRON- 
look at -PRON- wall a hundred foot straight up and even a squirrel couldnot get from here to the rim rock 
and there s the north end -PRON- be just like the side wall 
i move -PRON- take a look over south 
the north end of the canon be close by a sheer precipice 
the little stream hit the wall sink out of sight under -PRON- flow through a subterranean channel 
wait a minute call whipple halt -PRON- companion who be about to turn back this 
on the smooth surface of the end wall some hand have rudely inscribe with red pigment lose creek canon 
no chance to get out 
bottle up 
johnson blue 
vandeever read the inscription give a howl of despair and throw up -PRON- hand 
lose creek canon by glory that do settle -PRON- be plant for keep 
what do -PRON- mean charley 
whipple ask -PRON- never hear tell of johnson blue over to the no one ever mention lose creek canon around -PRON- not that i remember 
say listen 
this here be a pocket there ainot no gettin out of 
once here -PRON- be here to stay 
only -PRON- as hard to get into as -PRON- be to get out of mostly 
johnson blue get into -PRON- with rope explorin like and the rope get loose and come down on -PRON- 
a carrier pigeon -PRON- have with -PRON- get back to prescott with the news but the message be weatherbeaten and dim in spot 
the location of lose creek canon wasnot readable and people hunt for -PRON- for month hopin to save blue 
but -PRON- wasnot never save 
i reckon if -PRON- look well find what s leave o -PRON- around here somer 
vandeever take off -PRON- hat and slam -PRON- down on the rock then -PRON- lean against the sheer wall and laugh huskily and mirthlessly 
and here -PRON- and -PRON- -PRON- go on load to the brim with dinero and aimin to cut loose with -PRON- in los angele bottle up in lose creek canon without no carrier pigeon or rope or nothing j plumb cast away that s all and when be lay out cold the birdsll get -PRON- thousanddollar bill and line -PRON- nest with -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh again and the wall of the canon give back the nervewracke echo 
a north end of lose creek canon be cheerless forlorn and offer a despairing prospect but a find be make around the bend in the south end that put heart in the three castaway 
the wall here be steep and unscalable and a lofty barrier throw across the defile make of -PRON- a complete culdesac 
here lose creek find -PRON- bubble up from beneath the foot of the barrier flow the length of the canon and lose -PRON- again at the other end of that tremendous blind alley 
the surrounding south of the bend be not so depressing 
the wall be hang with trail vine which give a bowerlike aspect to that part of the mountain prison and there be a flat cover with a thick growth of oak and pinon and in the heart of this grove whipple and vandeever stumble upon -PRON- big surprise a small but comfortable log cabin 
that cabin could not have be build by johnson blue discoverer and original castaway of lose creek canon 
-PRON- be seven year accord to vandeever since home pigeon have flutter into prescott and the cabin be plainly of very recent construction 
-PRON- stand empty and deserted and there be no path lead to -PRON- door 
the door be not secure in any way but open readily to hand 
the single room within be marvelously equip for comfort 
three bunk furnish with blanket and pillow be build against the wall 
three chair stand around a small table and in a cupboard plate cup and saucer knife fork and spoon continue to carry out this remarkable grouping of three 
charley van pull off -PRON- hat and run -PRON- finger through -PRON- hair 
look like somebody have be gettin ready for -PRON- party be -PRON- comment this j nacherly rattle -PRON- spur in a second cupboard be find a bag of flour strip of hacon a box of potato and a generous supply of can good 
there be a stove too in one corner of the room with pot and pan hang all around -PRON- and even a supply of firewood pile beside -PRON- 
charley van collapse into one of the chair once say that -PRON- cup be and catch a little good luck when -PRON- rain trouble -PRON- didnot outfit -PRON- with so much as a ham sandwich when makin that start for los angele in the skyhooter so if mrs class luck hadnot drop this cabin and content down in the canon for -PRON- -PRON- would sure have starve plumb to death so new the worm havenot even get in the prune 
-PRON- can draw out the agony for quite a spell figgerin 
charley return whipple this pocket in the hill isnot so blame inaccessible as -PRON- have be try to make -PRON- believe 
somebody come here and fix up this place calculate to make a home out of -PRON- see for -PRON- vandeever return that there ainot no gettin out of here unless -PRON- sprout wing admit that hombre could come down on a rope same as johnson blue do but without that same rope gettin out be go to bother a heap 
three man build this cabin and get -PRON- ready to live in whipple go on and that wasnot so long ago because everything be fresh and new 
-PRON- must be plan to come back here very soon 
well charley when -PRON- come well use -PRON- mean for get into the canon to get out of -PRON- 
all -PRON- have to do be to wait exclaim vandeever hope toe get -PRON- chance to pull out before -PRON- thirty day be up and -PRON- be leave strand with that bundle of kale have to spend faster than i reckon on when -PRON- do hit los angele 
now bein hungry and the like o that how about gettin simmon over here 
-PRON- be braggin about how -PRON- can cook 
suppose -PRON- start -PRON- in 
all right go get -PRON- 
vandeever find simmon still sit on -PRON- bowlder very much cast down -PRON- forget be -PRON- first word to vandeever that still draw -PRON- hundred a day a mere baggytelle perce return the cowboy be -PRON- stringin -PRON- when -PRON- say -PRON- could cook a regular chef boast simmon and i be sit here think how i could eat if there be only anything eatable in sight 
well chirk up be go to feed 
come on and show -PRON- 
when the cabin and -PRON- supply burst on -PRON- vision the aviator be astound 
whipple be build a fire in the stove but vandeever pull -PRON- away from the work 
sim tell -PRON- that -PRON- expect -PRON- to pay -PRON- the hundred a day whether be flyin or lay up in this canon say vandeever 
by do the cookin and take care of the ranch i calculate that hell make all of five dollar a day anyways so i move -PRON- let -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- will jest sit around and fret because the spendin be so poor 
get busy sim among the supply be two or three dozen package of cigarette several pound of smoke tobacco and half a dozen deck of card 
vandeever make these discovery and announce -PRON- joyfully -PRON- whisper to -PRON- friend with -PRON- luck at the pasteboard -PRON- will be blame little of that hundred a day ever see 
simmon prove that -PRON- be really a capable cook by prepare an excellent meal 
all be in well spirit after -PRON- have eat -PRON- dinner 
while simmon be clear away the empty dish vandeever tumble into one of the bunk for a nap and whipple roam around the flat 
-PRON- seem to whipple as though there must be some way into that canon and out of -PRON- 
the story about johnson imprisonment in that mountain pocket may be farfetche 
whipple be not so credulous as vandeever seem to be so -PRON- go hunt for a possible avenue of escape 
-PRON- fail to find -PRON- 
the wall mask with trail vine be as precipitous as the bare rock face in other part of the canon 
whipple wonder if the vine be strong enough to bear -PRON- weight 
-PRON- learn that -PRON- be not for essay a climb by mean of the festoon creeper -PRON- sustain a fall of a dozen foot and give up -PRON- attempt 
as -PRON- move around the edge of the flat -PRON- foot kick against something and -PRON- stoop and pick up a small tin box 
the box be scar and worn and lock 
-PRON- break -PRON- open 
inside of -PRON- be an openface silver watch with a leather fob and an elk tooth charm attach to -PRON- eighteen cent in change a comb and brush a pocket knife and a memorandum book 
sit down at the foot of an oak -PRON- fall to examine the various object 
on the back of the watch be the monogram the same initial be engrave on the handle of the knife 
relic of johnson blue think whipple and pick up the little book 
on the flyleaf -PRON- read this write in a firm businesslike hand johnson blue late of new york city now of nowhere in particular -PRON- impression of life base on the way in which -PRON- live -PRON- and write for -PRON- own amusement while -PRON- slowly starve to death 
this be gruesome but -PRON- hold a fascination for whipple 
blue really have be bottle up in that canon 
-PRON- have send out -PRON- carrier pigeon hope for rescue 
rescue have not come and famine have claim -PRON- for a victim 
what -PRON- get this be vandeever 
have finish -PRON- nap -PRON- have go search for whipple 
the latter tell -PRON- what -PRON- have find and how -PRON- have chance upon -PRON- 
by glory the cowboy exclaim sit down at -PRON- friend side and look with deep interest at the watch the knife the military hair brush and the comb 
eighteen cent 
-PRON- be mighty nigh bust flat wasnot -PRON- 
whipple read from the flyleaf of the book 
purty tough comment vandeever with feeling 
and -PRON- may have starve allee same as blue if somebody hadnot build that cabin for -PRON- and fill -PRON- with supply 
poor old blue 
-PRON- must a be blue -PRON- last day 
i canot imagine nothing bad than have hunger get -PRON- 
read about -PRON- impression of -PRON- whipple begin to read no help have arrive and i have come to the conviction that the carrier pigeon fail to reach prescott 
that mean that -PRON- day be number 
the chuckwalla be not very plenty and not very appetizing 
in the heyday of -PRON- wastrel year i remember how squab on toast chicken a la maryland and roast canvasback duck pal on -PRON- jaded appetite 
if i have -PRON- million back i would give all of -PRON- for one dinner at i have keep pull up -PRON- belt a notch until -PRON- make a circle no big than a dog collar and not a very large dog collar at that 
but why repine 
i have have -PRON- fling and here i be hole away among the bleak mountain with -PRON- large fortune dwindle to a pitiful eighteen cent a good exhibit in the case of gal life versus a sensible existence i be a horrible example in the matter of what not to do with a million dollar and i feel the urge to put some of -PRON- philosophy down with pen and ink 
no one will ever see -PRON- but the mere writing will be a relief to -PRON- mind and will serve to beguile this period of wait for the end 
and i have an idea that i can make -PRON- finish the fine thing i have do in all -PRON- riotous year 
gosh exclaimed vandeever as whipple pause reflectively 
now whyever do -PRON- suppose -PRON- be writin like that read on answer whipple and see if -PRON- can find out be a happy man before -PRON- uncle ezra die and leave -PRON- that million dollar in hard cash 
keep book for halloran beezley and receive a hundred dollar a month for -PRON- 
get along beautifully put aside a little every week for a rainy day and have enough leave to ride over to coney of a saturday afternoon and take some real enjoyment 
and get away to the polo ground occasionally and yell -PRON- hoarse over a good ball game 
and there be ethel 
there be fine rls in this land but none fine than ethel wish -PRON- may know what have finally happen to -PRON- but that be hardly possible 
if i have take -PRON- advice but not sob about that or anything else 
i mix this dose of medicine for -PRON- and go to swallow -PRON- with a smile 
back in the old day though i be happy 
and i didnot know -PRON- 
i live in a little paradise all -PRON- own and i be get ahead at the rate of about three hundred a year 
then a snake crawl into -PRON- paradise a snake with glitter golden scale and diamond eye uncle million dollar didnot have to work any more what i tell halloran beezley 
work be for those poor fish who have no uncle to die and leave -PRON- a million 
i start out to put some new brightness in the gay white way 
-PRON- say i make good 
i have friend everywhere and -PRON- do -PRON- good to make -PRON- forget i have ever be a bookkeeper 
be -PRON- much of a trick to run through a million in a year 
not in a town like new york wet or dry 
when a man who now and then have to walk to save car fare wake up with a million in -PRON- mitt maybe hell still walk to save car fare but i doubt -PRON- 
if -PRON- be young as i be and if -PRON- have ability as a spender as i have hell probably buy -PRON- a flock of automobile and never walk any more than -PRON- just have to 
i scatter the million in twelve month and now here be far from the bright light a prisoner in these hill and with only eighteen cent in -PRON- pocket a fine case of dyspepsia and roasted chuckwallah do not agree with a finicky stomach all rusty from lack of exercise and i come to arizona for the mountain cure everlastingly too late time i die and r vandeever reach over jerk the book from hand and throw -PRON- angrily out across the flat reckon that will be all of that -PRON- growl 
now that -PRON- get -PRON- pocket full o money i ainot in any mood to listen to such stuff 
i hadnot a notion blue be that kind of a ciiniroon 
look like -PRON- be hit at -PRON- eh charley query whipple tell a man and -PRON- ainot a fair go either 
why inmlaze do -PRON- have to kick that tin box out o the brush but blue wasnot the same as -PRON- in -PRON- uncle contract that -PRON- get to spend 
blue wasnot oblige to do what -PRON- do 
-PRON- be go on -PRON- own when -PRON- get down to -PRON- eighteen cent some people plumb foolish 
whipple and vandeever at the foot of the oak in lose creek canon sit brood in deep thought over the foolishness of johnson blue 
what angle be take by -PRON- vagrant thought be no matter but presently the cowboy get up walk sheepishly over to the little book and pick -PRON- up and dust -PRON- off 
take care of -PRON- -PRON- say hand the melancholy record to -PRON- friend 
like enough after all -PRON- and -PRON- will get eighteen cent worth o fun out o readin -PRON- 
if -PRON- go into -PRON- spendin habit maybe there will be a tip for -PRON- when -PRON- get to lo have to work fast if be hold up here for much of a spell 
a little book of johnson wield an uncanny influence 
two day after -PRON- have be find all three young man in the canon have come under -PRON- mystic spell 
when whipple be not read -PRON- aloud to -PRON- companion either vandeever or simmon be sure to have -PRON- and to be deeply immersed in -PRON- content 
the sorry chronicle be less than five thousand word in length 
in give so much time to -PRON- therefore the castaway be continually reread part of the manuscript 
each have -PRON- favorite passage and whipple curious to know just what appeal most to vandeever and simmon take up the little book as each lay -PRON- down 
in case -PRON- clew be various leave bent at the corner and in simmon a pencil checking of sundry paragraph 
-PRON- develop that the cowboy interest be hold by ingenious method of extravagance 
-PRON- would charter a sumptuous private train for instance and take a large party of friend to some prize fight in the middle west or -PRON- would buy a private yacht spend a riotous month in the west indie and then sell the yacht for less than half what -PRON- have pay for -PRON- 
-PRON- would give dinner to boon companion at which diamond and platinum stick pin be pass around as favor 
once in florida -PRON- have rent an entire hotel for a week live in -PRON- in lonely grandeur with every employee at -PRON- beck and nod 
an extravagant eccentricity be never to wear the same suit of clothe twice but give away each suit when -PRON- be take off 
simmon mark passage consist largely of philosophical deduction false friend be one who share -PRON- bounty batten on -PRON- favor and then fail to recognize -PRON- when -PRON- money be go 
-PRON- be a deceiver and a thief 
and this crook be the physical manifestation of a crooked soul warp by greed and a hunger for easy money 
well that a man should have a millstone hung about -PRON- neck and be fling into the sea than to profit in such a way 
and again not money but the love of money be the root of all evil 
because of this -PRON- betray a trust and land in jail or -PRON- commit murder and hang 
one who love money for -PRON- be capable of any atrocity 
whipple on -PRON- own part be entrance with the whole tragic story but -PRON- pet paragraph be some of platitude such as waste not want not and be careful with what -PRON- earn and doubly careful with what be give -PRON- and stand on -PRON- own foot -PRON- behold to no man for so much as a nickel and spend wisely but save with even more wisdom for a tightwad be anathema and a wastrel be a lost soul and lastly this priceless ruby in the casket of diamond be not lure by relative or friend or stranger into way of wasteful extravagance for an act repeat become habit and habit become second nature and second nature become character and character make -PRON- what -PRON- be for well or for bad 
all this to some mind would have be a mere collection of rubbish 
-PRON- be quite possible to understand why the last writing of johnson blue may appeal to whipple and why a cowboy eager to master all the fine art of get rid of money may be interested in -PRON- but that percival simmon should ponder such passage as -PRON- have mark be an incomprehensible mystery 
johnson blue with just money enough leave to get -PRON- to some corner of the country have come to prescott 
like timon of athen -PRON- yearn for some desert place where -PRON- could forget the ingratitude of those whom -PRON- have believe to be friend and kill all thought of the girl ethel who have marry a well man 
so -PRON- buy a burro a grub stake several hundred foot of rope a homing pigeon in a wicker cage and set out for the heart of the hill 
-PRON- idea be to immure -PRON- on an island in the air a supposedly unscalable mesa call encan tada that have come to be a legend in the southwest 
-PRON- purpose be to get away by -PRON- burn all -PRON- bridge and even cast off the rope by which -PRON- have hope to gain the mesas top 
then if -PRON- tire of -PRON- hermitlike existence -PRON- would send word back to prescott by mean of the carrier pigeon and some one would come and effect -PRON- rescue 
-PRON- be a wild fancy 
-PRON- fail to find mesa encantada but -PRON- do happen upon a pocket in the ground as difficult of access as any island in the air 
with -PRON- rope -PRON- manage to get into -PRON- but the rope loosen and come down on -PRON- before -PRON- have lower the remainder of -PRON- supply into the canon 
week later -PRON- half starve burro wander into wickenburg this however be long after the carrier pigeon have make -PRON- home port with a damage message that tell of plight but fail to define -PRON- exact whereabouts 
so from last writing and information give by vandeever whipple piece the story together 
somehow the thrill of -PRON- grow on -PRON- as the day pass 
-PRON- seem to grow on the cowboy and the aviator as well 
knotty problem offer -PRON- to the castaway 
be -PRON- destine to reach the end of -PRON- provision and come to a wretched end there in lose creek canon as blue have do 
who have build and furnish that cabin on the flat with supply for three 
on the answer to this second question hang -PRON- hope of deliverance 
a week pass however without bring the owner of the cabin 
vandeever for once in -PRON- life at least have something more than -PRON- stetson on -PRON- mind 
by glory -PRON- complain lose a hull week here in this hole in the hill waitin for some one to come get to stop coolin -PRON- heel and try to find a way out 
grub be go fast and i move -PRON- meander around and try to find -PRON- rope of maybe -PRON- havenot rot clean to piece and -PRON- can use -PRON- in gettin clear o this blame pocket 
so -PRON- go hunt for the rope 
but -PRON- have vanish completely 
when absolutely certain that -PRON- be not to be find further attempt be make to climb the wall by mean of the hanging vine 
the vine be fragile and after vandeever have take a bad tumble the maneuver be give up as hopeless 
simmon raid the wreck of the ace high and remove and splice to34 gether a number of guy wire 
the result cable prove too stiff and unwieldy and nothing could be do with -PRON- 
in desperation another forlorn search for the rope be begin 
-PRON- be while this be go on that simmon creep along at the edge of the flat under a festoon of trail vine find a small wicker cage with -PRON- door unlatche 
this recall blue to the mind of the castaway 
here undoubtedly be the very cage in which -PRON- have keep -PRON- carrier pigeon 
vandeever fire with a sudden thought drop to -PRON- knee and continue investigation at that part of the foot of the cliff 
-PRON- creep through the vine be lose to sight for five minute and at last emerge into view with a white face and wild eye touch -PRON- -PRON- gasp draw -PRON- sleeve across -PRON- wet forehead and -PRON- -PRON- rattle 
oh -PRON- glory 
what rattle demand whipple 
bone in there blue what s leave o -PRON- 
never have such a start in -PRON- hull life layin under a bit of an overhang and -PRON- grin up at -PRON- all white and and well -PRON- finish jest have to have air

say muttered vandeever -PRON- give -PRON- a start sure answer whipple but -PRON- have get a duty to do charley a great little book -PRON- write and the least -PRON- can do be to bury these bone away in the pleasant part of the flat 
look -PRON- fountain pen

now there -PRON- lie and of what use to -PRON- be all the million in the world whipple sit down 
everything have be say that can be say i take -PRON- -PRON- remark about a fool and -PRON- money 
now and then at the bitter end a fool wake up and say or write a number of wise thing 
and -PRON- three would be fool if -PRON- do not profit by -PRON- 
if -PRON- ever get out of this canon charley i make a solemn vow to give back to uncle wes the rest of -PRON- money go to tell -PRON- that not fit for the job -PRON- set for -PRON- 
then then -PRON- ainot go to los angele at all inquire vandeever plaintively go back to the mine to work in the gold mill 
then -PRON- for the ranch if that s how -PRON- stack up say vandeever get mucho plenty of this canon and that book of -PRON- writing have plumb rob -PRON- of all the pleasure i may have have helpin -PRON- spend -PRON- uncle money 
i reckon the boy will gime the laugh but -PRON- canot sing that old chantey about the wad that wilt because -PRON- wonot stick 
simmon be have a struggle with -PRON- 
at last -PRON- manage to get the well of -PRON- feeling and observe in a strained unnatural voice get something to say man 
monte hire -PRON- to drop -PRON- on saddleback flat 
-PRON- and two of -PRON- pal be to be wait there and corral the kale -PRON- two have with -PRON- 
i be to have a share in -PRON- 
but i miss saddleback flat somehow in two jump vandeever be in front of simmon have a notion moren once -PRON- be playin crooked -PRON- yell 
now then -PRON- twoface sidewind right here where i beat -PRON- up whipple hasten to step between -PRON- 
no -PRON- say sternly hand off of simmon charley 
-PRON- didnot make anything by -PRON- treachery and here where -PRON- have put away johnson blue let bury -PRON- animosity along with some of -PRON- fool idea 
vandeever be red and wrathful 
not ordinarily could -PRON- have be halt in such a manner by the restraining hand of a friend but there be a spirit of peace abroad in the canon at that moment the spirit of johnson blue 
all right simmon say vandeever to the aviator -PRON- ainot the only one in this bunch that make a stumble 
-PRON- must not at that instant whipple leap at vandeever and simmon and pull -PRON- down 
-PRON- be excite and a wild light gleam jn -PRON- eye 
look -PRON- whisper point toward the vineclad wall come 
the man who build and stock that cabin be here 
watch descend sun slant over the western rim of the canon brighten the eastern wall 
the brightness be rise toward the top of the wall leave the foot of the cliff in shadowy twilight 
some thirty or forty foot up the face of the precipice full in the sun ray the mask of greenery have be open and man could be see work through the gap 
evidently these man have find foothold on a shelf conceal by the hanging vine 
at the distance from which -PRON- be view by whipple and -PRON- companion the form be indistinct although -PRON- could clearly be see that there be three of -PRON- 
say this be bully exclaim vandeever all the joy of a prospective deliverance rise in -PRON- soul 
as -PRON- climb in well climb out 
like enough horse bring -PRON- through the hill to the canon well well arrange to use -PRON- caballo for the trip back to phoenix luck -PRON- start across the flat in the direction of the cliff where the newcomer be at work but whipple catch -PRON- arm 
not so fast charley wait here and watch for a while something about that cabin that never look just right to -PRON- 
-PRON- will be well i think to let those fellow get down into the canon before -PRON- show -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- may decide not to come on if -PRON- find stranger here 
vandeever look thoughtful 
strike -PRON- -PRON- be too blame cautious -PRON- say but mebby -PRON- j as well to play safe 
-PRON- draw back into the tree shadow and continue to fix -PRON- gaze on the wall a path down that cliffside back o -PRON- vine right to the pint where -PRON- hombre be workin run -PRON- comment and mebby that s the way johnson blue get in 
but how do -PRON- reckon -PRON- find -PRON- 
-PRON- never guess there be a shelf part way up the wall do -PRON- 
-PRON- wouldnot have do -PRON- any good if -PRON- have put in simmon 
that shelf be all of thirtyfive foot straight up and -PRON- have no way of get to -PRON- 
by jupiter look at that 
something be toss out through the gap in the vine 
-PRON- twist writhe unfold and drop down ward resolve -PRON- into a long rope ladder 
as soon as -PRON- be in place the three man descend from the shelf one by one and land on the flat 
by that time the whole canon be plunge in gloom although the eastern rim rock still glimmer under the sun ray 
wait till -PRON- get to the cabin whipple suggest and then well walk in on -PRON- light up and well be able to give each other a good siz ing give -PRON- a big surprise chuckle vandeever if i know anything about -PRON- 
the newcomer trail like shadow across the flat make straight for the cabin 
whipple vandeever and simmon follow -PRON- at a distance bet a blue stack the cowboy hazard that -PRON- have get a mine down here placering like as not no gold in lose creek canon aver whipple be keep an eye out for that ever since -PRON- get here and the formation arenot right -PRON- idee in cornin here then what like to know 
man arenot go to all this trouble in lose creek canon unless -PRON- have something up -PRON- sleeve 
-PRON- doesnot look right charley 
the newcomer have reach the cabin and lamplight suddenly glow in the cabin window 
whipple and -PRON- two companion push on hurriedly and step in through the open door 
-PRON- be greet by a yell that indicate surprise and anything but friendliness a digger if -PRON- ainot concho charley the cattlepuncher gent as get to -PRON- for all that dough in the back room at whoop a voice 
sure -PRON- -PRON- cry some one else 
and -PRON- s bringin -PRON- pard monte cristo junior 
surprisin luck if anybody ask -PRON- 
simmon a third person demand how do -PRON- happen to miss the flat the other morning 
and how do -PRON- happen to know about this canon and get here and be wait for -PRON- with these lamb of the golden fleece 
-PRON- seem to have play -PRON- card pretty well but be hang if i can understand -PRON- 
whipple be amazed 
the last speaker be monte a trimlooke blackleg in fancy mountaineer clothe 
the two with -PRON- be -PRON- roughneck pal peco pete geohegan and silver sam hornaday 
all in all -PRON- be about as hard an outfit as ever drift through the arizona hill 
each of the three be well armed and at the moment have a vicious sixgun on display 
what weird turn of fate have bring these man into that lonely canon 
whipple wish then that -PRON- have be even more cautious 
bind for los angele on a quest for spendthrift pleasure neither -PRON- nor -PRON- companion have carry anything in the way of firearm and -PRON- partner be hold all the trump that hand 
the surprise be mutual but every advantage lie with the newcomer a fine lot of coyote ainot -PRON- now 
vandeever remark with fine sarcasm 
-PRON- plan to trim -PRON- there in the back room at but i gallop off with every sou -PRON- three have in -PRON- clothe matchin -PRON- run o luck aginst every nickelplated holdout in -PRON- tinhorn crowd 
then -PRON- scheme to get -PRON- all back by one way or another and miss the bet 
oh -PRON- be a fine outfit of sobber 
monte smile in the oily way characteristic of -PRON- not miss any bet here in lose creek canon concho -PRON- purr 
why didnot -PRON- come down at saddleback flat accord to agreement simmon -PRON- demand whirl on the aviator 
-PRON- get wise to -PRON- here simmon nod toward whipple and vandeever and -PRON- wasnot safe 
then the engine of the old boat go back on -PRON- and -PRON- just happen to land in this canon glad -PRON- get here threecard the good piece of luck that ever come -PRON- way 
whipple and -PRON- pard would have kill -PRON- i guess if i hadnot have help 
cold rage rise in heart -PRON- sorry now -PRON- ask that -PRON- didnot let -PRON- beat -PRON- up 
sim have be playin off on -PRON- 
whipple be nonplus 
at the grave of johnson blue such a short time before -PRON- have feel that simmon confession and regret be sincere but now -PRON- have execute a direct aboutface and be one of crowd 
-PRON- make this certain by step to the other side of the cabin and join the rank of the gambler 
how much have -PRON- get with -PRON- simmon query thousand in cash be the prompt reply 
good i didnot know but -PRON- may have hide -PRON- away somewhere 
put -PRON- on the table whipple every last stiver of -PRON- -PRON- never roar vandeever show -PRON- -PRON- tooth 
if -PRON- get that dinero make -PRON- fight for -PRON- 
-PRON- pick up a chair and back into a corner 
concho remark calmly when -PRON- and -PRON- outfit drop into this canon -PRON- come within one of put a crimp into the smooth paign i ever plan 
-PRON- find a neat little cabin here well stock with supply 
-PRON- and -PRON- friend jump right in and take possession of -PRON- not find any fault with that but i want to assure -PRON- that while be here -PRON- and whipple be go to stay here 
i expect to make this place -PRON- headquarters for the next six month 
show fight concho and well drop -PRON- in -PRON- track 
put down that chair be foolish charley say whipple all the odd be against -PRON- 
this easy yielding wasnot at all like whipple as vandeever know -PRON- so the latter reason that -PRON- friend have something at the back of -PRON- head in the way of a ruse 
strategy that be what -PRON- must be 
build -PRON- hope on that vandeever lower the chair sit clown in -PRON- gloomily and watch while whipple put all of uncle money on the table the part of wisdom whipple observe monte with unctuous approval 
-PRON- may also sit down for the moment 
peco -PRON- go on -PRON- go back to the shelf and pull up the ladder have an uncomfortable night up there but -PRON- have get to make sure that whipple and concho donot clear out and tip off this new roost of -PRON- to the sheriff 
-PRON- canot let that happen -PRON- understand until be through with the canon 
silver will relieve -PRON- in the morning and tomorrow night simmon or i will pull up the ladder and sleep on the shelf forget peco finish that there s a bundle of money in this for all hand 
the mention of money stifle the grumbling of pecos 
-PRON- put away -PRON- gun pull up -PRON- belt and leave the cabin 
monte approach the table and coolly appropriate the crisp bank note that lay there 
this should mean little to -PRON- whipple say -PRON- easily get rid of -PRON- quickly and with a few thrill that ought to interest old plunk 
sorry to dispossess -PRON- but -PRON- have get to have the cabin 
-PRON- and concho can bunk down on the flat see that -PRON- donot starve at least while be here in the canon with -PRON- 
when -PRON- leave for good well that will be another matter 
get a mine here inquire vandeever 
hornaday laugh hoarsely 
well -PRON- may call -PRON- that return with a twisted smile 
peco must be on the shelf by now -PRON- add so -PRON- two can clear out try any foolishness either of -PRON- 
-PRON- voice sharpen as -PRON- launch the warning play for a big stake and wonot stand for any nonsense on -PRON- part 
good night send -PRON- something to eat in the morning 
whipple and vandeever walk out of the cabin follow by the jeer of silver sam hornaday and percival simmon 
as -PRON- move away across the flat leaving behind -PRON- the cabin and -PRON- comfort the cowboy complain bitterly about the aviator 
-PRON- ort to be kill have even up -PRON- score jyith -PRON- if -PRON- would only have let -PRON- alone a while back 
now see how -PRON- have turn on -PRON- 
johnson book never get to -PRON- the same as -PRON- do to -PRON- and -PRON- 
whipple draw closer to -PRON- irate friend 
charley -PRON- whisper believe simmon be still on -PRON- side and that -PRON- s pretend to stand in with in order to be of help to -PRON- 
never in this world declare vandeever emphatically 
be that the reason -PRON- as so pesky meek in shellin out -PRON- thousanddollar bill 
if a thought -PRON- be bankin on that 
a fought till i drop 
simmon be a twofaced measly coyote all off with that noble idee o -PRON- to give back the dinero to -PRON- uncle 
but that ainot worryin -PRON- so much as gettin clear o this tough outfit and takin a slant for phoenix get back the money before -PRON- leave the canon assert whipple 
how 
whipple do not know how but -PRON- believe there would be opportunity and -PRON- would be able to manage -PRON- 
-PRON- lead the way through the gloom to the overhang where johnson blue have pitch -PRON- dismal camp 
aimin to sleep in there demand vandeever 
why not 
-PRON- get pretty cold at night and -PRON- must have some kind of shelter 
what be good enough for blue ought to be good enough for -PRON- 
whipple go down on all four and crawl through the swinging vine 
the cowboy follow -PRON- finally but not without many protest 
pll bet the place be hante -PRON- mutter 
well -PRON- couldnot be haunt by a kindly spirit than greatly oblige to johnson blue charley 
-PRON- have show -PRON- how to look wisely at some of the problem of life 
huh grunted vandeever -PRON- be only a spender that get cold foot when -PRON- money be go 
mebby -PRON- will sleep but be hang if i think go to 
night pard 
a a rock be all that whipple and vandeever have to sleep on there under the overhang 
but -PRON- be man of hard fiber and use to the hardship of the hill 
the chastened spirit of johnson blue seem to fill the place 
to whipple this unseen presence be as a benediction nor be -PRON- as disturb to vandeever as -PRON- have fancy -PRON- may be for when morning come -PRON- be sleep so soundly that -PRON- friend have to shake -PRON- into wakefulness 
see anything last night inquire the cowboy as -PRON- sit up and rub -PRON- eye 
not a thing 
same here 
glory 
i never reckon sleep like that crawl out o this hole in the wall and find the sun 
a morning in southern arizona be one of the most cheer wonder of the country 
the mount sun have a glory all -PRON- own and the air have a tonic warrant to put to flight all the blue devil that lurk in a human heart 
vandeever be in a more hopeful mood than on the precede evening 
if -PRON- could get hold of a couple o -PRON- sixgun -PRON- remark while -PRON- and whipple be dip -PRON- head in the creek -PRON- neednot ask no odd of anybody whipple shake the water out of -PRON- hair and dry -PRON- face on -PRON- handkerchief play a wait game charley -PRON- say and see what turn up busy get breakfast over there at the cabin -PRON- add -PRON- speculative gaze on the smoke that be rise from the chimney could mow away a man size share o grub if i have the chance 
seem like may invite -PRON- in for the morning snack 
-PRON- wonot do that -PRON- s plan to keep -PRON- at a distance from the money and the gun and will send breakfast out to -PRON- 
there come sam hornaday now whipple add 
and -PRON- ainot totin any chow grumble vandeever disappointedly 
hornaday however be not come in the direction of the two at the foot of the vineclad cliff 
-PRON- look in -PRON- direction grin unpleasantly and keep on toward the eastern wall 
there -PRON- halt and yell for pecos 
the latter look out from the opening among the vine answer the hail and then throw down the rope ladder 
-PRON- could capture the ladder from -PRON- two if -PRON- have any kind o luck vandeever suggest 
whipple shake -PRON- head 
while peco be descend the ladder hornaday stand at the foot of -PRON- on guard with a gun in each hand have a dream charley say whipple would be glad to have -PRON- try something like that 
after the dust settle there would be one amalgamator and one cowpunch to keep johnson blue company on this flat 
and what good would the ladder be to -PRON- if -PRON- have to use -PRON- and leave the money behind get to have action vandeever fret 
walkin lame and jumpin through the hoop at order be a heap more than i can stand 
take -PRON- easy there will be plenty of action when the right time cony 
peco step from the rope ladder to the ground do a brief round of sentry go while hornaday climb to the shelf and hoist the trail rope then peco make -PRON- way to the cabin 
everything so far as cleverness could devise -PRON- have be make secure 
presently simmon appear at the cabin door carry a basket 
-PRON- strike out briskly across the flat moving in the direction of whipple and vandeever 
the latter breathing hard jump to -PRON- foot 
whipple catch -PRON- and pull -PRON- back 
hang on to -PRON- charley -PRON- admonish 
-PRON- donot want to spoil -PRON- breakfast do -PRON- canot begin to tell -PRON- how the sight o that traitor grind -PRON- muttered vandeever see that -PRON- get -PRON- if -PRON- the last thing i ever do 
simmon halt a few foot away and set down the basket warily eye the cowboy as -PRON- do so 
charley be get -PRON- wrong -PRON- say pitch -PRON- voice low with -PRON- two but i can be of more help by pretend to stand in with straight 
kick up some kind of a row so i can have an excuse to stand here and talk for a minute be watch from the cabin and hornaday from the shelf 
at the first suspicion that not really throw in with -PRON- be as helpless as -PRON- two be maybe bad off 
whipple jump to -PRON- foot and advance a step bad than a sidewinder to turn -PRON- down like this -PRON- shout apparently in great anger 
all i want be a club roar vandeever 
simmon jerk a revolver from -PRON- pocket seemingly -PRON- be hold the two wrathful man at bay 
what -PRON- say still in an undertone be this hornaday and geohegan rob the bank at eudora and -PRON- be hide out here with sixty thousand dollar in cash and liberty bond 
-PRON- have fix up this canon for a hangout and have some more robbery -PRON- be aim to pull off 
when -PRON- find -PRON- here -PRON- sort of spill the bean 
go easy -PRON- two 
and be watchful 
bullet be apt to come -PRON- way at any time not do yet 
do something make -PRON- look as though there be bad blood between -PRON- and -PRON- be try to get -PRON- 
i be tell to shoot at the first sign of trouble 
vandeever start to make a rush 
crack go simmon revolver 
the bullet fly wide but vandeever clutch at -PRON- left arm and reel back to be on the shelf tonight guard the ladder simmon go on speak hurriedly -PRON- chance to do something come down around midnight and well see what -PRON- can do at the cabin 
-PRON- will be desperate though make up -PRON- mind to that 
simmon whirl on -PRON- heel and start back across the flat turning again and again to flourish the revolver and shout wild threat reckon that play look like the real thing say vandeever and sure surprised at that sim 
at that mebby -PRON- s only stringin -PRON- along 
give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt charley urge whipple prove to -PRON- satisfaction whether or not -PRON- can rely on -PRON- tonight 
-PRON- donot seem right sensible that would send -PRON- here with that grub unless there be some kind of a hen on muse the cowboy darkly 
-PRON- be roll up -PRON- sleeve and bind a handkerchief about -PRON- arm a red silk handkerchief with which -PRON- have supply -PRON- in phoenix 
have pretend to be wound -PRON- be important to keep the deception alive 
while eat breakfast -PRON- do not use -PRON- left hand but keep -PRON- tuck away between the button of -PRON- coat 
the meal be a generous one consisting of coffee cracker bacon and fry potato 
as the two friend eat -PRON- consider this new turn of event 
monte widely know as a crooked gambler have blossom into an robber and holdup man 
a safe retreat from the law be that hidden and inaccessible canon 
how have find -PRON- be a mystery but have find -PRON- -PRON- be not slow to recognize -PRON- value from a lawless viewpoint 
if press by officer of the law -PRON- could come down -PRON- rope ladder and if the canon be find -PRON- could pull down the ladder as a last resort 
from that spot -PRON- and -PRON- confederate could make -PRON- raid and then return to a rendezvous that be almost proof against discovery 
naturally find whipple and -PRON- companion in the canon be a disagreeable surprise to the unpleasantness however be temper by the seventyfive thousand dollar which whipple have be force to give up 
for a little while and because of uncle money the gambler may bear with the castaway but in due course as whipple know monte would tire of the trouble whipple and vandeever make -PRON- and would seek to eliminate -PRON- 
before this tragic move be deliberately attempt the amalgamator and the cowboy would have to strike and strike hard with simmon help be the time aver whipple for -PRON- be take grave chance if -PRON- wait longer than that 
have finish -PRON- breakfast -PRON- light a pipe and arise to -PRON- foot go over to the bend and see if the wreck of the ace high have anything to offer -PRON- in the way of a makeshift weapon 
if -PRON- come to close quarter with the gang tonight charley -PRON- ought to have something besides -PRON- fist to fight with 
good idee assented vandeever 
as -PRON- start north along the creek suddenly appear from the cabin 
-PRON- carry a rifle 
where have -PRON- start for -PRON- shout 
j takin a little amble to stretch -PRON- leg vandeever answer with a scowl 
well amble around the flat but keep clear of the cabin 
try to leave the flat concho and well open up on -PRON- 
that go as -PRON- lay 
vandeever hesitate clench -PRON- fist and grind -PRON- tooth 
fust time on record i ever take order from a tinhorn -PRON- growl 
but i reckon there ainot anything else to be do 
-PRON- turn and begin follow whipple back toward the vineclad cliff 
and here something else yell 
-PRON- two have get to cut out the rough stuff when i send some one over with -PRON- meal 
simmon ought to have lay -PRON- out concho 
just for what -PRON- do this morning -PRON- man will get no dinner 
if -PRON- prove to be peaceable and obey order about stay on the flat take some supper over to -PRON- -PRON- 
vandeever be furious but -PRON- have sense enough to smother -PRON- feeling 
most certainly -PRON- and whipple be under the thumb of this smooth tricky card sharp and hard though -PRON- be the situation would have to be bear for the present 
the morning pass with another reading of johnson book and the discussion to which the various philosophical gem give rise 
in view of the melancholy circumstance that prevail in the canon the last word of the wastrel castaway be more impressive than ever 
noon pass and be as good as -PRON- word about withhold dinner 
at one oclock peco relieve silver as guardian of the ladder and both ruffian in go and come jeer the two hungry man as -PRON- pass -PRON- 
this be fierce tell a man grunt vandeever 
hit -PRON- anywhere but where i live i can stand anything but that 
-PRON- ought to be able to miss a meal with good grace charley say whipple 
think what blue have to put up with 
oh stand -PRON- return the cowboy hastily but like to eat a hundred dollar wuth o ham and egg in front of and -PRON- famishin and lace to a post with a reata 
the afternoon drag horribly and hornaday and simmon play card in the shade of the cabin gun close at hand 
-PRON- be careful to take up a position from which -PRON- could watch whipple and deever every minute 
as the sun drop low over the rim of the canon the card playing cease and hornaday and simmon go into the house to get supper 
when be call by hornaday to come in an eat -PRON- stand up and look in the direction of the amalgamator and the cowboy change -PRON- mind conho -PRON- call 
-PRON- and -PRON- pard stand -PRON- so well without dinner that go to hold back ypur supper 
vandeever give an ugly laugh as vanish inside the cabin 
even a smooth tinhorn like -PRON- can play the fool now and then -PRON- remark to -PRON- friend 
the bad fighter i ever see be a guy just hungry enough to be mad and not starve sufficient to be any way weak 
because of losin -PRON- two meal walk in on the hull gang this minute alone and with -PRON- bare hand go to be some fight when -PRON- pull -PRON- off have play well a very difficult role 
-PRON- be no easy maneuver to deceive monte and yet this be precisely what simmon have do 
the gambler be convince that the aviator be faithful to -PRON- and -PRON- lawless plotting and believe fully that no love be lose between the aviator and whipple and vandeever 
so simmon be trust with the work of guard the rope ladder 
-PRON- relieve peco and go on duty while the sun be still flash brightly on the vineclad wall but -PRON- have not be fifteen minute on the shelf before and hornaday run swiftly across the flat and take up -PRON- position at the foot of the cliff 
hey simmon shout what be -PRON- do with two extra sixgun get a brace of revolver more than -PRON- need or be entitle to 
drop -PRON- into the blanket 
as -PRON- finish speak -PRON- and hornaday stretch a blanket between -PRON- and wait for the weapon to be throw into -PRON- 
but -PRON- wait in vain 
whipple and vandeever guess what have happen 
in -PRON- zeal to help -PRON- simmon have appropriate the extra revolver and take -PRON- with -PRON- when -PRON- climb to the shelf 
-PRON- be not minded to give -PRON- up and so yield an advantage gain by -PRON- cleverness 
besides faith in -PRON- be shake and temporize with a man like this gambler when -PRON- be in such a state of mind would have be suicidal 
simmon keep well back on the shelf and hang on to the gun 
hornaday lose patience and swear heartily have well command of -PRON- 
put over the ladder percy and come down request the gambler -PRON- tone and manner not at all suggestive of the emotion that fill -PRON- 
simmon however be too know to let down the ladder and descend and place -PRON- at the mercy of threecard monte 
come down the gambler order at last drop -PRON- mask of friendliness and proceed to threat give -PRON- two minute and if -PRON- be not down by that time silver and i will riddle the face of the cliff with bullet 
no word or sign come from simmon then promptly when the two minute be up a merry fusillade stir wild echo in the canon 
peco a cup of coffee in one hand and a sourdough biscuit in the other come to a corner of the cabin to watch the excitement 
whipple be not slow to see that a situation have develop which if quickly and properly use would be highly advantageous to -PRON- and vandeever 
charley -PRON- whisper while and hornaday be busy with simmon and while geohegan be give all -PRON- attention to that side of the canon no one seem to take any interest in -PRON- and -PRON- 
come on detour to the west and reach the cabin door while geohegan be face the other way 
that scheme be a lulu mutter the cowboy with enthusiasm 
a quick run to the left bring the two around the western side of the cabin 
whipple be almost at the open door when peco awake to what be go on behind -PRON- 
the coffee cup go one way and what be leave of the biscuit go another 
no yu donot -PRON- roar dash for the open door and juggle with a revolver as -PRON- come on 
back up or drop yu where yu stand whipple shift -PRON- line of advance and instead of enter the cabin -PRON- plunge straight at pecos 
the latter halted plant -PRON- firmly and lift the revolver 
whipple be desperate and geohegan equally determine 
a distant report shatter the still air break a lull in the target practice of and hornaday 
geohegan give vent to a hoarse yell of pain and the revolver fall from -PRON- fist 
score one for sim shout vandeever jubilantly 
that be as neat a bit of drop firin as i ever see 
simmon have come into action and at the very instant -PRON- service could best serve -PRON- friend 
whipple reach side at a jump and in a flash have gather up the fall weapon 
into the cabin with -PRON- -PRON- order prod peco with the muzzle of the gun 
monte yelled peco as -PRON- grip -PRON- injure right arm with -PRON- left hand sam trouble at the ca whipple give peco a push that send -PRON- through the open door headlong get -PRON- cry vandeever from inside the cabin 
get in here quick once the door be closed -PRON- can hold this shack aginst all comer 
that move however effective though -PRON- may be be not for whipple and hornaday have lose all interest in simmon for the moment and be race back toward the cabin 
a revolver crack and a bullet buzz angrily past cheek 
-PRON- find -PRON- look into the gambler cool murderous eye tell -PRON- what to expect if -PRON- cut any caper snap and now here where -PRON- get your 
-PRON- first shot have miss because -PRON- be in too much of a hurry 
now -PRON- be more deliberate and laugh jeeringly when whipple flex -PRON- finger bring down the hammer of gun on an empty shell no doubt feel that -PRON- could afford to take -PRON- time and make sure 
whipple be near the great divide at that moment than uncle wes have ever be in -PRON- life 
but waste three second and while -PRON- weapon hang fire a cabin window on -PRON- left crash outward and in the midst of the fly glass come vandeever over the sill fall on the gambler and bear -PRON- down the good ever charley exclaim whipple and immediately give -PRON- full attention to hornaday select -PRON- lawless aid with care and discrimination and geohegan and hornaday be the pick of those man who regard the law lightly and be of proved ability and courage 
the tide be set against but hornaday run true to -PRON- tradition and while possibly dismay -PRON- be ready for a lastditch fight 
fling -PRON- down behind a small heap of firewood a few yard from the corner of the cabin -PRON- begin take pot shot at whipple from cover 
indian fashion whipple take to a tree thus screen -PRON- break the weapon that have fail -PRON- in the contest with and examine the shell in the cylinder 
all be empty and useless a piece of carelessness on part which in other circumstance would have win a rebuke from vandeever have drag into the cabin and there judge by the sound that come through the open door -PRON- be fairly busy 
with a useless gun and no cartridge at hand with which to replenish the cylinder whipple be at an impasse 
hornaday watch weaseleye be wait for -PRON- to show enough of -PRON- to make a target worth while 
this blockade be lift by simmon as unexpectedly as vandeever have crash through the window and fere with watch from the shelf in the gathering half gloom the aviator have realize how badly -PRON- be need by -PRON- friend so -PRON- have lower the ladder cross the flat and come up noiselessly on side of the woodpile 
the first whipple know of this be by a startled yell from hornaday 
the yell be follow by sound of a furious struggle and whipple leave the oak tree and run swiftly to give simmon a hand 
from that point on the struggle be as brief as -PRON- be decisive 
when hornaday at the revolver point be march into the cabin be discover flat on -PRON- back on the floor two knee on -PRON- chest one hand compress -PRON- throat and the other hand grip revolver threaten and hold geohegan at bay 
a little work on the part of whipple and simmon make the victory complete 
rope be find and the gambler and -PRON- confederate be firmly lash and render helpless hand ere leave free because of -PRON- wounded arm but -PRON- foot be bind and -PRON- be clear that -PRON- have lose all relish for further combat 
that be short and snappy tell a man 
vandeever exult 
about twice as short and snappy as if -PRON- have treat -PRON- and white and give -PRON- -PRON- grub 
if -PRON- want to make a reglar panther out of a man j give -PRON- a touch o famine that never occur to -PRON-

while two of -PRON- sleep one be always on guard 
the prisoner be resourceful and desperate man and no chance be to be take with -PRON- 
next morning there be an early breakfast and the three friend make -PRON- preparation for leave the cabin and get out of the hill 
three canteen be fill with cool clear water from the creek and three pack of supply be make ready 
three revolver belong to and -PRON- partner be appropriate and -PRON- cylinder replenish with fresh ammunition 
whipple have try hard to learn something about the situation of the canon the route to be follow in get back to phoenix and the method by which and those with -PRON- have reach that part of the rough country 
the gambler have nothing to tell -PRON- and neither have hornaday nor geohegan never make -PRON- on foot have say -PRON- grub and water will be go before -PRON- be halfway out 
a stray prospector may find -PRON- bone some time in the future but even that be a bet 
then return whipple coolly -PRON- will be as hard on -PRON- as -PRON- be on -PRON- for when -PRON- leave here well haul up the rope ladder 
if -PRON- get out well send a sheriff and posse back after -PRON- better isnot -PRON- than starve to death in this canon 
a gloomy expression cross the face of hornaday and geohegan but the gambler seem utterly unmoved 
not accord to -PRON- way of thinking say all the firearm in the cabin be carry away by whipple and -PRON- friend 
geohegan be leave with -PRON- hand free and -PRON- would be only a short time before -PRON- release and hornaday of -PRON- bond 
carry off the gun be to prevent further trouble while the homewardbound party climb to the rim rock and set out on the eastern trail 
whipple who be the last man to reach the shelf find -PRON- on a broad smooth ledge which have a downward pitch to the place where -PRON- join the cliff 
simmon explain how easy -PRON- have be to keep clear of bullet launch from the flat merely by hug the rear wall 
and there s the way up -PRON- finish indicate the lip of a fissure that angle steeply toward the top of the wall back of the swinging vine have a mind to explore that only didnot give -PRON- time 
the rope ladder be draw up and pile on the shelf and all the extra firearm be lay beside -PRON- then whipple lead the climb for the top be begin 
steady nerve be demand for this and the amalgamator be glad that the festoon vine hide from -PRON- eye the dizzy depth of the canon 
in due course -PRON- come out on the crest of the bank and pause to let -PRON- gaze rove over the flat 
all the prisoner be free of -PRON- rope and stand in a forlorn group by the cabin -PRON- face no more than white patch against the greenery below 
hornaday and geohegan shake -PRON- fist coolly light a cigarette gaze move toward the left where a sandy mound lift -PRON- among the tree 
all that be mortal of johnson blue be there a misguided man who find wisdom in the spot where death overtake -PRON-

-PRON- turn to look eastward 
-PRON- be a discouraging vista for all that could be see in that direction be peak after peak 
whipple descend an easy slope on -PRON- way to a seam that open between two of the hill 
-PRON- stop suddenly -PRON- eye on the sand in front of -PRON- 
one secret be out anyway -PRON- exclaim get here in an automobile where the machine stop to let -PRON- and -PRON- two partner off and there s where -PRON- turn to take the back track 
a note of cheer creep into -PRON- voice 
if an automobile could get here -PRON- go on donot see how be go to run into any very hard traveling 
all -PRON- have get to do be to follow the track 
the track be easily trace and lead into the seam wound tortuously about the basis of the hill and then climb a ridge and descend into a wide shallow valley 
the sun be mount toward the zenith a brazen fiery shield whose ray grow hotter as the day wear on 
heat wave rise from the baked earth quiver in the furnacelike air 
clump of cholla cactus and greasewood dance grotesquely when view through the waver transparent veil 
simmon be first to give out 
-PRON- stagger to -PRON- knee with a groan no good at this kind of travel -PRON- complain 
this pack on -PRON- shoulder weigh a ton 
for the dozenth time -PRON- uncap -PRON- canteen and put -PRON- to -PRON- lip 
vandeever snatch -PRON- away from -PRON- waterlogge sim say the cowboy 
-PRON- get to be careful o the stuff in the canteen 
and anyways -PRON- could drink like a fish and -PRON- wouldnot help none 
get up and try agin help -PRON- 
with vandeever on one side and whipple on the other lend -PRON- -PRON- support the aviator reel on 
over -PRON- head the amalgamator and the cowboy exchange significant glance 
simmon be not toughen to the desert as -PRON- be and -PRON- realize that -PRON- be go to be a tremendous handicap 
but -PRON- have play a man part in the canon face set hard and lip tighten 
what one think be at that moment in the mind of the other -PRON- would all win clear of those scorch waterless hill or -PRON- would all stay in -PRON- to the end of time 
when simmon foot refuse to move another step whipple find a great bare pinnacle of rock and in -PRON- shadow all three sit down for a rest 
-PRON- eat some of -PRON- food wash -PRON- down with a few sip from the canteen 
when the time come for -PRON- to start on again whipple and vandeever scan the sky with ominous eye and decide to remain where -PRON- be 
the hilltop to the north be blur with a haze of ghastly yellow 
the haze thicken into an opaque curtain and draw onward with a rush 
a puff of wind blister hot stir the sand of the valley until the ground seem to be smoke an elegant row of stump growl vandeever a thing like this couldnot happen only right now could -PRON- the matter query simmon 
sand storm answer whipple briefly 
hug the lee of that rock simmon and pull off -PRON- coat and have -PRON- ready to put over -PRON- head 
-PRON- all knelt and push close to the rock pinnacle 
the fly sand whisper against -PRON- worn side then as the wind increase in fury gusty blast eddy around the huge bowlder and drive the sand stingingly against -PRON- face 
the yellow fog be all around -PRON- and the smother heat make breathe almost impossible 
with head muffle in -PRON- coat -PRON- gasp and choke and almost stifle 
the physical torment bring by the storm give the impression that -PRON- be hour in pass but -PRON- duration could have be measure in minute 
after reach -PRON- height -PRON- breathe -PRON- out leave three mound of sand from which the traveler extricate -PRON- 
that be short than usual remark vandeever shake the sand out of -PRON- sleeve and wipe -PRON- from -PRON- grimy face 
the bad thing -PRON- do to -PRON- be to blot out the track of that automobile say whipple now -PRON- have get to head east and go -PRON- blind 
when -PRON- pack be disinter -PRON- be discover that simmon canteen be miss 
-PRON- could remember nothing about -PRON- 
all three spend an hour kick around in the loose sand and be compel at last to give up the search 
lose the canteen be a calamity but nothing be say by whipple or vandeever to make simmon feel bad about -PRON- carelessness than -PRON- do 
-PRON- struggle on down that interminable valley -PRON- only blessing the lessen heat of the sun as -PRON- drop toward -PRON- setting 
another halt be make at sundown 
the aviator by that time be in a sorry state 
-PRON- eye be puff -PRON- tongue and lip be swollen and the last particle of energy have be sap from -PRON- body 
but there be a grow coolness in the air that be most refreshing and simmon slump to the ground close -PRON- eye and sleep 
whipple arouse -PRON- after a while and give -PRON- -PRON- ration from the pack 
-PRON- eat gulp down the little water -PRON- be allow to have then go to sleep again 
an hour later -PRON- two companion get -PRON- to -PRON- foot once more and -PRON- continue -PRON- weary plodding onward under the brilliant arizona night sky 
whipple con -PRON- course by the star and press the pace 
there be now a very decided chill in the air which would have be most uncomfortable have the three traveler not be constantly move 
simmon bear up better than -PRON- have do during the day but -PRON- strength be flag even while whipple and vandeever be go at -PRON- good no good at this -PRON- pant -PRON- fellow go on and leave -PRON- here 
when -PRON- get out send somebody back to pick -PRON- up 
not on -PRON- tintype sim return the cowboy with emphasis 
-PRON- all go or -PRON- all stay and that s flat 
buck up 
-PRON- can make five mile at night a heap easy than -PRON- can do one by day 
here well help -PRON- 
whipple and vandeever take turn carry simmon pack and help to support -PRON- 
-PRON- manage to keep -PRON- on -PRON- foot until after midnight and then find further attempt useless 
drop to the ground on the very spot where simmon give out all of -PRON- sleep dog weary and worn to the point of exhaustion 
-PRON- awake with the blaze sun once more in -PRON- eye and the blister heat grow as the sun mount toward the high heaven 
then begin such a struggle as neither whipple nor vandeever have ever know in all -PRON- arizona year 
simmon grow lightheade and become hard to manage 
-PRON- fight to get hold of the canteen and the few drop of water that remain in -PRON- -PRON- discard -PRON- pack -PRON- sit down obstinately and refuse to move in short -PRON- do everything -PRON- irrational mind suggest to delay the journey 
the amalgamator and the cowboy grapple with -PRON- drag -PRON- carry -PRON- -PRON- one consume desire to get onward at any cost 
simmon begin to see vision of flow water and green tree 
-PRON- babble about -PRON- and try to crawl to the shelter of the grove and reach the stream 
vandeever sprawl in the hot sand give vent to a croak laugh 
-PRON- reach out gropingly with -PRON- hand -PRON- canteen -PRON- ask faintly 
right in front of -PRON- there exclaim the startled whipple -PRON- see -PRON- charley

good pard a man ever have -PRON- mutter 
if here where -PRON- take the long trail i couldnot ask for no well company ride back to consciousness on a sea of troubled dream and a voice which have an oddly familiar sound cause -PRON- to sit up quickly and take notice 
-PRON- be night one of those splendid night for which the desert country be note 
the star be so big and bright that -PRON- seem as though one have only to reach out a hand in order to get hold of belt or of the big or little bear 
there be a lush smell of standing water and whipple lower -PRON- eye and see a goodsized water hole surround by a dusky chaparral of mesquite 
how the moonbeam play and dance over that stretch of water in the near distance be a glow camp fire 
a very tall man in sharp silhouette be jerk a bag from the tooth of a scrawny cropeare burro 
toss the bag on a heap of camp plunder the man haul the burro away on a picket rope picket -PRON- where -PRON- wonot be so handy to the grub handsome say the boss of the camp and -PRON- and the burro lose -PRON- temporarily in the chaparral shadow wander glance take in -PRON- close vicinity

and i lose a lot of -PRON- mainly because -PRON- and -PRON- party have climb into the sky and nobody have any idee where -PRON- have come down 
the guess be pretty general that -PRON- be all kill by an accident to -PRON- machine and be lyin in the mountain somewhere 
naturally i want to beat the coyote to -PRON- money 
monte have put up a job on -PRON- and -PRON- know about that uncle wes cut in whipple

-PRON- see there be no sign of -PRON- at saddleback flat and no sign of and -PRON- crowd but -PRON- all have a notion -PRON- have be wreck in the mountain so -PRON- begin to hunt each in -PRON- different way

of course why uncle wes i be plan to return -PRON- to -PRON- shy something like twentyfive thousand say the old tightwad 
be -PRON- willin to make -PRON- up to -PRON- a nice kind of an uncle -PRON- old skinflint yelp vandeever 
after tellin to go out and spend the dinero -PRON- be now crawfishin on -PRON- own game 
how can -PRON- give -PRON- back what -PRON- hasnot get an extry twenty thousand in cash in the satchel remark uncle wes and forty thousand in liberty bond 
-PRON- canot have -PRON- uncle say whipple -PRON- belong to the eudora bank loot a reward of five thousand dollar out for capturin the robber return uncle wes cannily and ten per cent of all the loot recover 
that mean eleven thousand cornin to -PRON- 
that would help some 
part of the reward go to charley and simmon whipple tell -PRON- uncle but -PRON- can have -PRON- third of -PRON- 
then there s something else pursued uncle wes 
-PRON- give muggyone mike moloney fifty dollar and the old hassayamper use -PRON- for a grubstake drawin up an agreement with -PRON- signin -PRON- and leavin -PRON- with felix vannell at the fordham 
and be bless if muggyone didnot prance right out into the phoenix mountain and drop onto a true fissure that everybody have walk over for the last fifty year 
the rock go fifty dollar to the ton and already muggyone have be offer a big price for -PRON- find 
muggyone locate that prospect file on -PRON- and have the big offer to buy all in lessn ten day fast work on reecord and the only time in -PRON- hull rovin life that muggyone ever have any luck 
-PRON- hasnot run much in -PRON- line 
-PRON- three go ahead and sleep uncle wes continue go to sit up and keep the fire blazin bright 
the sheriff and -PRON- posse be trailin around in this part of the hill and tryin to signal -PRON- readin a right interestin book -PRON- have in the satchel with all that money the last writing of johnson blue 
go ahead and read -PRON- urge vandeever as -PRON- fall back on the sand and turn over on -PRON- side if -PRON- wasnot such an ironclad old hiderack mebby -PRON- word of would get under -PRON- skin and do some good 
but -PRON- wonot do no harm to give -PRON- a chance anyways be all a part of history now the sudden and meteoric rise of one wesley whipple who ride into phoenix one spring day scattering ballad all along the trail from the threeply mine to town 
-PRON- story as one glean -PRON- from the paper read like a tale from the thousand and one night 
first there be uncle wesley plunkett deceive -PRON- with the help of doc flickinger into believe -PRON- be already climb the foothill of the great divide and be to be over the summit in three month to a day almost to an hour 
then come the queer proceeding whereby uncle wes execute a rightabout from -PRON- miserly habit give -PRON- nephew outright one hundred thousand dollar to spend and enjoy and a few day later in a spirit of rich comedy the record tell of doctor mixinger of prescott proving to the old prospector by stern method that -PRON- heart be all right and that -PRON- still have thirty year to live 
there be chuckle in phoenix over that and more chuckle over the way old plunk go into the hill hunt for -PRON- vanish nephew and what remain of the hundred thousand 
all arizona know in due course how whipple and vandeever and -PRON- hire aviator simmon have be cast away in the mysterious lost creek canon and there have be find by hornaday and geohegan fresh from saddleback flat where -PRON- have miss a gay scheme of plunder only to connect with -PRON- again in pocket among the hill 
how whipple and -PRON- comrade have turn the table on and -PRON- man leave -PRON- in the canon and almost perished on -PRON- way out of the hill be but part of a story tell over and over in store and dwelling among the mine and on the cattle range 
and the kick which fate have put into this particular angle of the affair be wrap up in the fact that -PRON- be the one who have find and rescue -PRON- nephew vandeever and simmon not only get back what remain of -PRON- money but also and this be the big the marvelous thing as -PRON- turn out find the book of johnson blue and develop an absorb interest in the wastrel sound philosophy 
the whole southwest learn how the sheriff and posse in -PRON- flivver catch smoke signal from the camp at the water hole make for -PRON- and learn about the bank looter trap and hold in lose creek canon 
vandeever -PRON- sight restore but with eye protect by smoked glass furnish by uncle wes pilot the law officer along the shallow valley over the ridge through the seam and so to the canon 
there the wily and -PRON- two roughneck confederate be capture with very little trouble and land behind the bar of the building in the courthouse plaza in phoenix 
after the court have deal with -PRON- -PRON- be take to another place of stone wall and bar for an extended stay 
bad news however be current regard mogollon mike moloney and the fiftydollar grubstake furnish by whipple 
originally -PRON- have be bestow as a free gift to an old friend but so white be moloney in -PRON- intention that in secret -PRON- draw up a grubstake agreement and deposit -PRON- with felix vanne in trust for whipple 
the mine be sell ultimately for fifty thousand dollar 
of this amount however whipple receive nothing as moloney lose the entire amount in settle gambling debt which -PRON- incur on the strength of -PRON- find fifty dollar cast as bread upon the water therefore never return to -PRON- and the incident could not be include among the dazzle romance of the mining country 
but as whipple remark -PRON- have expect nothing and therefore could not be disappoint 
the bank reward go share and share alike to whipple vandeever and simmon 
and vandeever and simmon be not forget by whipple for when the latter buy a ranch near prescott charley van have an interest in -PRON- and act as foreman and simmon who start wrong but catch -PRON- up through the writing of the late johnson blue be also give a position 
the right kind of prosperity dawn for everybody and seemingly -PRON- have root in that little book of johnson strange of all perhaps be the effect the book have on wesley plunkett so fascinated be -PRON- with the weird record and -PRON- gem of wisdom that -PRON- borrow the book and keep -PRON- for two week 
when -PRON- return -PRON- to -PRON- nephew -PRON- be a changed man 
as doctor alfre mixinger have undeceive -PRON- regard -PRON- health so johnson posthumous influence alter -PRON- whole conception of life 
uncle wes want to return the seventyfive thousand dollar to whipple declare that -PRON- have give -PRON- in good faith and should not take -PRON- back 
but whipple insist that -PRON- have no right to the money quote blue to support -PRON- argument and refuse flatly to accept -PRON- 
although overrule on this point uncle wes be like the rock of gibraltar in refuse to let -PRON- nephew make up any of the amount -PRON- have spend wasnot to invest any of the hundred thousand uncle wes argue whipple but -PRON- seem that i do that unwittingly 
if charley and i hadnot buy the aeroplane -PRON- should not have be cast away in lose creek canon and should not have be able to recover the bank money or get the reward for capturing and -PRON- two pal stand pat growled uncle wes obstinately book be a lesson for tightwad as well as for spendthrift and take -PRON- lesson to heart 
from now on by gorry go to pay taxis and every cent get go into taxable bond 
i owe that to a land that can produce a man like johnson blue 
hereafter go to live like a white man 
get -PRON- get -PRON- health and go after some of the brightness and happiness doctor mixinger mention 
and there s that galusha mingo investment -PRON- boy and then the rest of -PRON- the wedding go to buy a present for that affair that will cost a wad of money -PRON- to be 
here be something else again 
uncle wes refer to an event that happen when whipple come out of the hill stop for a night at jimmie cabin in apache draw 
uncle wes have to return the burro -PRON- have borrow a longeare campraide pack animal who be call handsome because -PRON- be so ugly 
galusha mingo and katie be there -PRON- will be remember and hence whipple be very anxious to stop 
-PRON- be welcome with open arm by mingo and with much happiness by katie 
to both of -PRON- -PRON- recite the adventure that have follow -PRON- attempt to get to los angele by aeroplane so that aid and abet by concho charley vandeever -PRON- could spend largely and acquire most for -PRON- money 
what a blessing -PRON- be wreck in a canon comment galusha mingo where -PRON- couldnot spend a cent no -PRON- be wrong mr mingo correct whipple the blessing come to -PRON- in the form of a book write by the late johnson blue 
but well not discuss that 
-PRON- finish -PRON- recital katie listen breathlessly 
all very good approve galusha mingo 
capture the robber and recover the money have cause -PRON- to get ahead in spite of -PRON- 
no doubt -PRON- have wonder about the ten thousand dollar which i pry out of -PRON- 
well tell about that 
katie and i be worried to see -PRON- spend -PRON- money so foolishly so -PRON- lay -PRON- plan to save some of -PRON- for -PRON- 
with the money -PRON- let -PRON- have i buy an option on big brick block 
-PRON- be hard up and eager to sell and -PRON- option call for a bargain and give -PRON- thirty day for a turnover didnot need the thirty day -PRON- continue 
in just a week i dispose of the option for twenty thousand dollar and i be hold the profit for -PRON- 
-PRON- would be a start -PRON- see want -PRON- to know add mingo earnestly that i didnot take that money for -PRON- 
-PRON- be a plot of and -PRON- to help -PRON- and i have to draw on -PRON- psychology and proceed by indirection in order to be of any assistance to -PRON- 
katie have worry about that and the false position in which -PRON- have apparently place -PRON- talk that over say to mingo 
suppose -PRON- take a walk down the draw katie -PRON- ask 
-PRON- take -PRON- walk and by a spring under a cottonwood tree -PRON- sit down and katie begin to speak of mamie and lorena want to tell -PRON- about mamie and lorena katie whipple interrupt 
if -PRON- will remember i meet those two girl at a party at -PRON- house 
-PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- 
whenever i come into town with a little money to spend mamie and lorena be all for help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- while -PRON- be always ask -PRON- to put -PRON- in the bank or pay -PRON- debt 
well -PRON- know debt never bother -PRON- much 
i be always for let the other fellow worry 
too free and easy -PRON- understand but with not a desire to beat anybody out of what be -PRON- just due 
i just couldnot seem to get the hang of that 
i want a lot and thirty a week wonot go very far 
-PRON- constant talk of save rather jar on -PRON- so i turn to mamie and lorena 
there i make -PRON- big mistake 
that night i plunge with -PRON- to the extent of fifteen dollar and forty cent and -PRON- call -PRON- down oh very nicely for do -PRON- i feel as though all the fun have be take out of the evening 
but always i want -PRON- to know i have a thousand thought of katie mingo where i have one of mamie or lorena how i feel deep down in -PRON- heart 
there be that in -PRON- eye at this moment which bring a vivid flush to cheek 
and when -PRON- take -PRON- hand -PRON- do not withdraw -PRON- be worry over there in lose creek canon katie whipple go on 
-PRON- see johnson blue when -PRON- be a bookkeeper at a hundred a month lose -PRON- heart to a girl name ethel the only part of -PRON- name that appear in -PRON- book 
just ethel if i have the full name and address go personally to tell ethel what happen to johnson blue 
well when blue get -PRON- million dollar from -PRON- uncle and begin have high jink with -PRON- -PRON- appear that ethel reprove -PRON- for -PRON- spendthrift habit just as -PRON- reprove -PRON- i imagine 
and blue feel annoy and go -PRON- own way and finally find -PRON- a prisoner in lose creek canon with only eighteen cent in -PRON- pocket and the girl whom -PRON- love married to a well man what worry -PRON- there in the canon katie 
what if -PRON- marry a well man while i be read johnson blue and see the error of -PRON- way and make a firm resolution to be different if i ever get out of that pocket 
what if wesley say katie softly -PRON- wasnot possible 
what wasnot possible demand whipple a wild suspicion stab at -PRON- heart 
why answer katie -PRON- eye lower that i could marry a well man than than -PRON- 
the wild suspicion that katie may be pledge to another at once take wing 
and will -PRON- marry -PRON- katie ask whipple have prospect now and thank to johnson blue i can be all that -PRON- father would have -PRON- 
katie look up 
tell -PRON- if i be go to be the happy man that ever live what katie say -PRON- be not necessary to put down here for -PRON- answer stand reveal in that question of uncle the wedding 
whipple very joyfully tell -PRON- when be the wedding and uncle wes shake -PRON- hand hard the girl i have pick for -PRON- all along -PRON- aver 
-PRON- hasnot be proud of old plunk in the past i reckon but that s all go to be change from now on 
and some day j -PRON- add earnestly want -PRON- to take -PRON- to lose creek canon 
what for ask whipple curiously want to put a tendollar wreath on the grave of johnson blue be the answer 
and that to any one who have know the old uncle wes be something for -PRON- to say
