by paul jones the most remarkable character of the revolutionary young sea adventurer whose daring deeds have long been told in song and story whose name thrilled the whole world and created a reign of terror alongthe coasts of great britain when he battled with and conquered some of the best war ships of the british navy while his own was but little better than a man who knew not the meaning of the word fear and who was as gallant as he was brave

the cry of the lookout on the forecastle of the vengeance which as our readers will remember was the flagship of dashing paul jones the founder and hero of the american navy galvanized into activity the crew who as it was sunday afternoon were lounging in various lazy attitudes about the deck of the speedy war ship
hardly had the first cry rung out than it was echoed from the main topmast where away bawled lieut
dale first luff of jones vessel
right off the starboard was the response from the maintop
right off the port bow was echoed from the forecastle
at the first cry jones had issued from his cabin beneath the poop deck he had been up all the previous night for the vengeance and the squadron acting as her consorts had run into a stiff blow and it had needed all the seamanship of jones and his mates to bring her through all taut
the commander of the vengeance ran forward buttoning his wellworn uniform coat as he went and telescope in hand took up his position on the forecastle head
he was followed by his first lieutenant and the young fellow to whom the reader has been previously introduced as jimmy blake the powder monkey but whose rank was raised by special act of congress and who was now known as ensign james blake
the crew too had clustered about their commander as he swept the sea with his glass
what do you make of them sir the question came from jimmy whose face was flushed with eagerness at the thought that here at last was the vanguard of the british fleet that jones had pledged his word to congress to keep from a swoop on the shores of america
the lads heart beat high at the feeling that at last he was to have a chance to go into action and prove to the nation that he was a not unworthy son of the first american navy
jonqp laid aside the telescope and then turned to the lad with a kindly look in his keen gray eyes
they are ships of war he replied that much is certain but of what nation i have no means of ascertaining till we are near enough tomake them show their colors
but they can be none other than the vanguard of the british fleet let us hope so for i do not want the britishers to slip past us in the night or otherwise evade us
the vengeance was tearing through the water at a rate that gave her two consorts the pallas and the hrig concord all they could do to keepwithin sight of her
the stiff breeze that was blowing had laid her over till her channels were awash
dale cast an anxious glance aloft at the straining top hamper of the flagship
her great sails were bellied out rill it seemed as if they must carry away and the taut rigging whistled like piano wire
had i not better order down the main topgallant he asked looking at jones whose gaze was bent intenth ahead at the two ships that were as yet only dim purple shadows on the horizon
no said the young commander without removing the glass from his eye keep on all standing as we are
i mean to get up with yon craft before nightfall if we fetch our sticks out
dale nodded but ordered new tackle bent onto the weather rigging and the sheets flattened a little so as to take the strain from the bending spars
the excitement was intense
not a man on board the ship but was eager for a brush with the british vessels if indeed they were british
we will teach the beggars a lesson quoth old bill cuff the boatswain to a group of his mates who had gathered about him to glean from his figs the veterans opinion of the chance there was of a scrimmage when they overhauled the two big vessels ahead
the latter seemed to be under no particular apprehension though they must have long since sighted the little yankee squadron
as jones had said they were two of the leviathan threedeckers of the english navy
as they stood about in the bright sunlight the flashing atlantic waves heeled them over till they showed their copper
both of them sported three rows of ports a side
it seemed madness on the part of the young american commander to pit his tiny fleet against two such formidable fighting machines but as the british had learned to their cost it took more than heavy odds against him to deter the young sea eagle as people had already begun to call him from facing his countrys foe
hurrah exclaimed the young ensign we are in for a fight sure
do you hear that mates cried old bill cuff as he heard the words of his young commander we are in for a fight
away you starboard battery men and get your barkers ready to give johnny bull a warm reception
at this juncture a strange interruption occurred in the shape of an exceedingly fat and exceedingly black negro who was projected from the door of the galley with a force that suggested that his movement was not entirely voluntary
the ship was heeling over to the ever stiffening breeze till her lee scuppers were all awash
the unfortunate cook for such was the office of thedarky who had just emerged from the little galley held in his hands a large kid of steaming pea soup which was destined for the mens dinners
he had intended to carry it forward but as he crossed the threshold of his domain the ship gave a lurch and the negro gave a yell as he felt himself and his savory burden being gradually impelled toward the boiling puddle of the scuppers
scipio seems to be in trouble said dale as his eye lit on the struggling darky
the words had hardly left his lips before a second chocolatecolored face was poked out of the galley door and a second portly senegambian went staggering to the aid of his unfortunate fellow cook
old bill cuff saw their predicament
sink me if them fellers ainot goin to let the crews dinner go to feed the fish he angrily exclaimed as the two darkies wildly gesticulating were forced nearer and ever nearer to the seething scuppers
the old bosun was a man of action and he did not waste any time on mere words but plunged gallantly to the rescue of the two struggling cooks
golly
massa cuff shrieked the second of the two sons of ham but dis am a terrible ting dis yar sea sure nuff
belay shouted old cuff as he clawed his way along the steeply sloping deck
ef yer spill that thar soup ye black idjuts brain yer with this fist
with these words he shook thatformidable member at the already terrified negroes
unfortunately for his dignified demeanor however the ship at the same moment gave an unusually violent lurch and the old boatswain was sent spinning straight against the men to whom he had been handing out his admonition
the two holders of the soup kid gave vent to a howl of dismay as they saw the burly form of the old sailor hurtling toward them with the speed and force of a projectile
cuff himself saw long before it actually happened that a collision was inevitable unless one or the other of the negroes sheered off
hard over ye lubbers he yelled with his storm voice as he was pleased to call the stentorian tones with which he wasin the habit of calling the watch on a rough night
the wretched negroes obeyed his instructions literally
their obedience however was involuntary for the massive body of the old man reeled with all the force that a fresh lurch of the plunging ship imparted to it full against them
men and soup went sliding into the boiling mass of water in the lee scuppers
cuff was on his feet in a moment and stood painstakingly wiping the soup out of his grizzled whiskers with one hand while he wrathfully shook the other at the two halfdrowned darkies
bad luck to you you leatherskinned sons of ham he roared
sure its myself that wishes the ark had struck a rockand gone to davy jones locker before son ever got to africa to raise such a gang of fellows as you are
but mister tuff poor scipio got no further
cuff is my name sir roared the infuriated boatswain
yas sah massa bluff face grew purple
are you making fun o me on purpose he demanded
no indeed sah massa ruff and its rough youll find me my laddybuck
lay aft lay aft and get some more peas from the stewards boy or its a coffin well be makin for you before night
jones and his young officer were watching the scene from the forecastle head and the young commander when he had recovered from his first amusement took pity on the misfortunes of the two negroes who had been taken to sea by him from the plantaion he owned in virginia in order to satisfy the craving they had expressed to see de mighty oshun
many a time since tjie vengeance and her two consorts had sailed they had regretted their rash step and now were looking forward in terror to the day when they would smell powder for the first time
as they hastened back to the galley to carry out the furious order jones hailed the boatswain
they are punished enough mr cuff he said as seriously as he could
besides i have work on hand for you elsewhere than in the galley
the vengeance was by this time separated from the two britistuwar vessels by a little over half a mile
this space she was rapidly covering
half an hour more would lay her alongside the two great craft
jones face was lighted up with the eager look peculiar to it when the young commander was about to go into action
with flashing eye he felt the hilt of the magnificent sword presented to him by louis of france mean to attack them asked dale or shall we try and show them a clean pair of heels jones turned on him almost angrily
we are pledged to drive the red cross of st george from the western seas he exclaimed and shall we turn tail at the first sight of the enemy but objected dale we shall in all probability be blown out of the water at the first broadside from these fellows intend to fire the first broadside was the calm reply
but they are undoubtedly not alone the rest of the fleet is somewhere about and it would be madness to engage the entire force of the british
our duty lies plainly before us
dale
will you order the signal man to inform the pallas and the concord that we will engage the enemy and you blake lay aft and have the port battery cleared for action
the two officers hastened to obey
it was none too soon to put the ship in fighting trim for the next moment a puff of smoke from the side of the hindmost of the english ships and the scream of the ball as it passed over their heads warned them of the hostile nature of the two strangers even if they had not been informed of their nationality by the display of the british naval flag
shall we give it to them back si asked jimmy who had got his battery in fighting shape and was eager for a chance to show what his carefully trained gunners could do
not yet replied jones we would simply be wasting powder and shot and we cannot afford to do that
you intend to reserve your fire then asked dale present yes
we will wear round tothe windward of them and then show our teeth that will give us a distinct advantage
the other nodded and seemed about to say something but he was interrupted by a wail of anguish from the two negroes
massa jones cried scipio am it a fac sah dat you intends to fight with them two big ships jones nodded
then fo de sake massa i have ter giv you notice an mus respectfully request tq be put on dry lan once more am afraid that is impossible scipio
den we have to stay aboard an hear dem awfly bullets go whizzin over our heads
no massa we mus mos respectfully decline de honor
an i secon de motion declared cato
what exclaimed jones half amused and half angry thought you two fellows wanted to see what life on a ship was like and here at your first chance of smelling powder you want to get out of sight
as far as is possible out of sight yes sah massa jones dat am a solid fac
then down with you into the forecastle
this ship is no place for two such cowards as you are
dat may be true sah but i was taught by my ole mammy in good ole virginia dat it is a great deal better fo folks to say dar he goes dan dar he lays
despite his disgust jones could not refrain from laughing as the two woollyheaded cowards disappeared down the forecastle hatch
there was no time however to exchange words on any other topic than the business in hand
the vengeance was now close enough to the rear frigate to read her name benbozv which was displayed in gorgeous scrollwork on her rounded stern
this was the vessel commanded by capt hawksdale who had sworn to rid the sea of jones or sink his own vessel in the attempt
jones was well aware of thisboast for during his visit in france he had been informed of the bitter enmity the british captain cherished toward him
as he recognized his enemys vessel the battle light came into his face
the lines about his mouth set and hardened and a steely glint came into his eyes
it was the face of a fighting man
show them the rattlesnake he ordered curtly and a moment later the famous standard of the coiled rattlesnake was floating from the peak of the gallant yankee vessel
the pallas and her companion followed suit and a fullthroated american cheer was borne over the waves as the emblem of liberty was displayed
the british vessel replied with a volley of musket balls that did no more harm than to plow up the deck
they had the effect however of arousing the american crew to a state of fury
the scoundrels roared old bill cuff squinting along the polished barrel of the wickedlooking bow chaser
the old man was an expert gunner and jones had intrusted to him the task of winging the great threedecked frigate so that she would be at the mere of the broadside
at last jones gave the longexpected signal
let them have it he said to the boatswain
cuff stepped back a foot or two and waited lanyard in hand till the vengeance came up on an even keel cut her maintop in half if you can cuff cried jones eagerly
every eye on board jones vessel was on the old man as he jerked the lanyard
the gun spoke and the deadly missile screeched through the air
the ball sped through the rigging of the britisher and parted some of her maintop hamper but the spar itself was untouched
missed by thunder exclaimed bill wiping the smoke from his eyes with the back of his hand
at the same moment the britisher wore round an evo lution in which she was followed by her sister ship
signal the others that we will tackle the benbow ex claimed jones turning to the signal master they must hold the attention of the other threedecker while we engage
the signal man broke out the bunting and the brig and the little put their helms up and headed for the consort
jones himself took the wheel of the vengeance and jammed her up into the wind till she had the britisher on her weather quarter
fortunately the vengeance was what is known to sail ors as a weatherly craft and she could hug the breeze a good two points further up than the big threedecker which as was the way of her type showed a wake almost as broad as a county
the sailing qualities of jones ship brought him up where he could rake his foe with deadly effect
the young commander stood on his quarterdeck in his battlestained uniform and watched the movements of the threedecker intently through the telescope
when the foresail of the vengeance began to shiver as she took the wind over her bow he ordered her to bear down on the huge foe that was now floundering about like some agitated leviathan
the reason of her dilemma was that her captain had attempted to follow jones evolution and had only sue ceeded in getting his ship into irons
that is that she was jammed up into the wind till she pointed right at the blow
this had the effect of setting her all aback and she lay helpless for a moment till her people could swing her great main topsail about
jones was quick to see his advantage and act on it
fire
the command was passed from the poop deck to the region below where in the light of the battle lanterns the crew stripped to the waist and barefooted were ramming home the deadly contents of the starboard broadside
a sheet of flame and smoke belched from the side and she trembled from stern to stempost as the guns discharged their deadly hail
jones sprang into the lee rigging as the smoke blew out over the sea and eagerly observed the effect of his assault
the telescope showed him that his broadside had severely crippled the britisher but owing to the great height of her sides the shots had for the most part struck her too low to inflict as much damage as would have been the case had she been raked along the decks
it was at this moment that the accident dale had dreaded took place
as the yankee ship after pouring in the broadside was put before the wflnd the main topmast backstay parted with the report of a cannon
instantly the sail tore the spar of the main topmast clean out of its steppings and in a moment everything aloft was in a terrible muddle
the man at the helm let her pay off in order to save the foremast for had that spar parted they would have been at the mercy of their foe as much as if they were aboard a helpless wreck
the moment was the opportunity for which the benboiv had been waiting
at the same time as jones ship had met with her disaster the british ship had been eased and her pruning broadsides now threatened the brave little vengeance
a perfect volcano broke from her three gun tiers and the decks of the yankee ship were swept as though by a tornado under the storm of shell and grapeshot that hurtled about her
the little craft was riddled from stem to stern and her rigging cut to shreds by the chain shot with which some of the british guns had been loaded
the already strained masts snapped like wooden knit6 ting needles as the stays parted and the falling timbers and blocks converted the decks already strewed with the dead and dying into a veritable shambles
amid the confusion jones and dale with jimmy and old bill cuff alone remained calm
the scene was enough to try the nerves of the bravest
everywhere men were dying or dead
the vessel which but a moment before had been as stanch a craft as sailed the sea was converted into a mere dismantled hull at the mercy of the britisher to do as he willed with
get together all the men you can was jones first order and cut away all this hamper
it ainot much good muttered old bill cuff as he sounded his boatswains pipe to which however not more than a dozen men answered we are as good as dead already
after the mass of rigging and spars that had floated alongside had been cut away by the crews axes the vessel was found to be fast sinking
at the same moment jimmy uttered a cry and pointed to the threedecker
she had gone about after her deadly broadside and was now bearing directly down on the dismantled hull
what can she intend to do asked dale
if she keeps on her present course that question is easily answered was jones reply
what does that mean
that she is going to ram us and send us to the bottom never she could not be so inhuman
why not
this is war and they are dealing with a foe they are determined to crush out at all hazards
they will stop at nothing to accomplish their purpose
this is fiendish exclaimed jimmy
is there no way we can save ourselves if she carries out the plan you think she has
dale asked the question
he was a brave man as brave as could be found on the high seas but there was something terrible to him in the thought of being sent to the bottom without having a chance to strike a blow in his own defense
if he could have died fighting he would have met his death as would his two companions without a tremor
jones thought jtfor a moment his eyes fixed on the fast advancing threedecker as he pondered
there is a way he said at length but it is such a desperate resort that i am afraid you will not care to adopt it
what is it
why when the crash comes we must spring into her main chains and swarm onto her deck
it is only changing our mode of death
possibly but while there is life there is hope and i mean to make the attempt
paul jones you are a brave man
to avoid death
i donot think so that is an instinct even with animals
you must take care to keep your pistols dry for we shall have plenty of work for both them and our cutlasses when we get on the british decks
the men who remained of the crew were called aft and the plan explained to them
they all agreed to stand by their officers and fight to the death rather than be sent to davy
jones in their riddled hulk
there was no doubt now of the plan
straight down on the doomed yankee bore the leviathan hull of the threedecker driven at tremendous speed by her great spread of canvas
she was drawing so near by now that the men on the battered vengeance could almost hear the swish of her forefoot as she cut through the seas
a shudder passed through more than one of the men on the bloody deck as they thought that ere long the keen stem would have cut the hulk they floated on sheer in half
it was at this moment that paul jones left the deck and disappeared down the after companion
he was not missed for several moments in the general confusion that reigned at the time
the young commander swung himself easily down the companion stairway till he reached the alleyway leading to the powder magazine
he wrenched one of the smoking battle lanterns from the wall and tearing off a strip of his shirt wetted it in a pail of water which stood near the magazine door and then spread powder on the dampened linen
then he listened intently
above the groans of the dying that made the ship hideous lie heard a warning cry from the deck
the moment had come
quickly he thrust the strip of linen which was to serve as a fuse into the flame of the lantern
it made a capital fuse and he trust it sputtering and glowing into the magazine
then he turned and ran quickly to the deck
he was not a moment too soon
right above the smoking battered hull of the little vengeance towered the huge black shape of the threedecker
from the low elevation of the little craft the britisher seemed to tower like a mountain
stand by cried jones as the huge sheering bow was right upon them
stand by was echoed among the devoted little yankee band
the next moment there was a rending crash as the bowsprit of the britisher tore its way through what was leftof the top hamper
as the bobstay of the leviathan swept over dieir heads the men on the deck of the vengeance reached up and seized it
several of them caught the stay and hung for a moment suspended over the rending timbers of the ship that had borne them so long and so faithfully ere they swarmed into the main chains
tones himself made a spring for the port channels and soon joined his followers in their effort to reach the deck of the big threedecker
before the british crew which was massed on the bow of the war ship to witness the destruction of the audacious yankee was aware of what had happened jones and his men stood or their forecastle and with drawn swords and pistols drove furiously at the johnny bulls
the rather stolid crew of the britisher were so completely taken off their guard that it was some moments before they collected their wits sufficiently to rally and make some resistance to the bold yankees
by this time the rest of the britishers that is to say the few that had been left on the poop when the britisher made her swoop on the poor vengeance had rushed to the aid of their comrades
they were too late though to stop the furious swoop of the americans who with paul jones waving his sword high above his head in the lead had dashed right through the group on the forecastle and were now well amidships
it cost hard fighting to gain this position and their numbers were sensibly decreased in the desperate sortie
we cannot hold out if they rally and attack us in a body dale was saying when his words were cut short by a roar that seemed to rend the very sky
at the same moment there was a blinding flash of light as if a thunderbolt had been launched in their midst and they were thrown flat on their faces by some superlative force
at the same time the entire forward part of the british war ship was hoisted skyward and the air was dark with the rain of shattered timbers and dismembered human bodies
as soon as they were able after the shock the americans struggled to their feet and gazed about them dazed for a moment at the suddenness of the whole affair
dale was the first to guess what had happened
you fired the magazine of the vengeance he said to jones
the young commodore nodded
there was a look of triumph on his face as he did so
his plan bad succeeded beyond his wildest expectation
of their late enemies not more than half a dozen remained and these were huddled forward in a frightened group eying the yankees as if they were some sort of supernatural beings
they offered no resistance to jones when he ordered them to be imprisoned in the forward deckhouse but huddled into their prison like a herd of frightened sheep
the smoke hung so heavily over the scene that jones was unable despite his anxiety to see how the pallas and her consort were faring
suddenly through the dense fog of powder fumes a voice sounded
vast you british lubbers it hailed
by heaven you have tackled a genuine yankee sailor this trip and if you come one step nearer blow some of you to kingdom come
the voice had a familiar ring
it was that of old bill cuff
in the excitement of the moment no one had missed him and it filled their hearts with joy to think that their old shipmate was safe and sound
they hailed him back and in another moment they were all shaking hands on the battlescarred decks of the britisher
a puff of wind sent the smoke which had hung over them till now like a pall streaming out to leeward
at what was revealed when their full vision was restored to them every man on that deck gave a cry
the sea was within a few feet of the vessels main deck
it was evident that the ship was taking on water fast and had only a short time to live
they were in the most desperate situation that can confront a mariner
paul jones and his men were alone on the shattered decks of a sinking ship
anxiously they cast their gaze about the ship
their vigilance was barren of results however for her boats hung shattered in the davits
jones cast a sweeping glance about them
down to windward hung a heavy cloud of smoke
in the midst of it he could not doubt were the two remaining ships of his squadron
what their fate was the cloud of battle did not enable him to ascertain but he had every confidence in commanders crawford and biddle and knew that they were giving a good account of themselves
although the situation did indeed seem hopeless jones was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet
at any time and particularly in moments that would have seemed to other men their last his bold spirit rose to the emergency and had many times turned defeat into victory
there are no boats as you see he said turning to dale
no was the reply it seems our doom is sealed
not at all
there is still a chance chance
yes though we have no boat we can build a raft stout enough to hold us till either the pallas or the concord sees us and picks us up
this put new hope into the little party and they set to work to collect a number of planks that seemed suitable for their purpose
these were lashed as securely as their time limit would allow to a number of empty barrels which would give the raft buoyancy in the water
their preparations complete jones threw in a keg of water and a bag of hard sea biscuits
he would have stocked their frail craft with more water for he did not know how long it might be before they were picked up but time pressed
the last preparations were barely completed when the ship gave a sickening lurch
for a brief second those on board thought that their last moment had come but with a brave effort the dying ship righted herself
she was now so deep in the water that to launch the raft over the side was an easy matter
a faint cheer rang out from the yankees as the wretched contrivance slipped into the water it was very faint though for not a man who stepped aboard her but realized that they might be going to their deaths
as they shoved off from the side of the sinking ship dale cast a swift glance round the horizon
far to windward there was a faint outline of purple mist lying like a veil over the blue water
the first luff gazed at this for some moments with a troubled expression on his face
it seemed that he scented trouble in the dim filmy mass
if he did however he said nothing to his companions none of whom seemed to have noticed the appearance that had caused a shadow to rest on his brow
at this moment his reflections were cut short by a wild cry from the deckhouse of the sinking ship
they had forgotten the imprisoned british sailors
their pleas to be taken off were pitiful
without a moments hesitation jones who had the key of the place plunged into the sea
with swift strong strokes he had reached the side of the sinking britisher almost before his companions had had time to guess what he was about to attempt
seizing a dangling piece of rope he swung himself easily to the deserted deck and raced for the deckhouse
the cries of the poor creatures within were pitiful
shoot us if you will they cried but for pitys sake do not leave us to drown like rats in a trap come to save you cried joneg as he turned the key and flung the door back
the deck was trembling with the vessels last throes as the men rushed out
swim for your lives for the raft shouted jones she is going down
they all plunged into the water and made for the raft
all that is but some half dozen who were unable to swim
one of these a fairhaired young fellow of slender build jones helped to the raft
this man was the only one he was able to save
the others sank like lead after a few struggles
pull for all you are worth or we shall be caught in the undertow cried dale as soon as his leader and the rescued men were safe on board a sinking ship creates a whirlpool into which everything afloat in her immediate neighborhood is drawn admonition was timely
as he spoke the stern of the threedecker raised high in the air and then with a noise like the rending apart of huge timbers she sank forever
those on the raft had little time to watch the spectacle for they were kept busy sculling her out of the undertow
the man whom jones had rescued gazed at the sinking derelict with horrified eyes
but for you he said to jones should be going to my grave with the other poor fellows
who am i to thank for my rescue my name is paul jones was the quiet reply
the fellow started back as if struck by lightning
paul jones he exclaimed
why they told me that you killed every englishman and gave no quarter to your foes
we give quarter but we never ask it was the curt reply
spoken like the brave man i now believe you are
i was the second lieutenant of yon illfated craft my name is charles harkness at your service capt jones and can i ever reciprocate your noble act i will do so
thank you said jones am sure that you will
they were interrupted by a cry from dale who for some time past had not removed his eyes from the filmy cloud that had first attracted his attention when they were putting off from the ship
the fog he cried
unless we can make the pallas or the concord before it is on us we are lost
there was a note in his tones that gave no doubt of the seriousness of their position
the men pulled with all their strength for the two vessels which were still fighting the other britisher
the raft was a clumsy contrivance however and despite their efforts the fog curtain rolled over the darkening sea toward them till they were wrapped in its soft impenetrable folds
a it was a situation filled with horror
they had no compass and even if they had one it would have been useless to them in the surrounding gloom
occasionally they could catch the distant boom of guns which told them in a vague way the whereabouts of the other two vessels but although they pulled through the dense mist as they judged in the right direction they could not seem to get any nearer
unless the fog lifted they had to face a situation that was unparalleled for sheer hopelessness
their raft was ofthe frailest and even with the greatest economy their slender stock of provisions would not last them more than a day at most
they shouted with all the strength of their lungs in the effort to attract some attention but no answer came to their hails
at length the sound of firing began to grow fainter and they were compelled to acknowledge although the realization brought with it a chill that they were adrift on the unknown with the vessels that might have given them aid rapidly bearing away from them
what made it harder to bear was the thought that assistance had they been able to signal was so near at hand
suddenly from out of the fog a voice answered their hail
if you be english for de sake be mussiful an pick up two distressed mariners it moaned
another voice coming from the same direction as the first chimed in with we never did have no use for dat ere paul jones
we is genlemen an prisoners till we was blowed up
now we dunno if we is alive or jes colored angels
despite their terrible situation not a man aboard the raft could forbear smiling as he recognized the voices of scipio and cato had forgotten them exclaimed jones
well i am glad they are safe and sound for had they been sunk in the vengeance i should never have forgiven myself
a rift in the fog revealed to the men the raft two woolly heads bobbing side by side up and down on the swell and holding tight to a floating chicken coop
loud duckings from the interior of the latter showed it to be occupied
the negroes were soon hauled on board to the intense disgust of old bill cuff who opined that there wassomething not just all right about people who could emerge from an explosion like that of the magazine of the vengeance without further hurt than a little singed wool and a bad fright they drifted helplessly about till the fading light told them that night was coming on
with the coming of darkness a low moaning wind sprang up and the sea began to roll in a wav that made the wretched collection of planks and barrels creak ominously
what if the raft should part
dale whispered to jimmy
we should have to trust tc luck to get us out of it replied jimmy
there is another peril we shall have to face even if we do escape from the raft what is that
why you know these waters are alive with british vessels and i suspect that the two we encountered were simply stragglers from the main body
our position would indeed be serious if we fell into the hands of the british
especially if they found out that we had sunk one of their finest ships
see
it looks as if this measly fog were going to lift at last
the rising wind had indeed driven away the fog mass in heavy swirls of vapor that streamed far out to leeward like strips of veiling
from behind the driving masses a sickly moon shone out and feebly illumined the heaving waste of waters
the men on the raft gazed eagerly about
toward every point of the compass they looked
the result was bitter disappointment
not a trace of a sail was to be seen
as far as the eye could reach the sea was empty save for the frail and hurriedly put together raft that floated a mere speck on the desert of waters with her burden of humanity
jones approached dale old friend he said we have need of all our courage now for this ip something very different from the excite inent of battle
true it means days and perhaps weeks of impotent suffering
days perhaps you forget that we cannot by any possibility survive for more than a week
trite and even then we will not dwell on it but hope for the best
now some had better lie down and try to sleep
the men on the raft lay down on their frail support of planks and closed their eyes
not one of them slept however
their thoughts were busy with various things far removed from the waste of deserted waters that surrounded them
toward morning slumber mercifully visited some of them
when dale awoke he saw
jones standing by a make shift mast he and old cuff had rigged up with the aid of one of the oars
the young commander was eagerly gazing all about him
the eastern horizon was dyed a delicate pink with the first heral dings of the coming day and under the fresh light of dawn the heaving desert of salt water showed as desolate as though the keel of man had never plowed it
you see nothing sir asked dale
jones shook his head
the moaning of one of the men who had been wounded struck on their ears
water water he moaned
jones nodded with a significant look at the tiny keg of the precious fluid dale knew what he meant at once
there was hardly enough water to last them the day
jones stooped over the wounded man and let him drink his fill
it was later in the day that the others aroused themselves for they all felt that it was better to drowse away the hours till they should be rescued than to suffer the agonies of waking suspense
toward noon jones made a distribution of biscuit and water
they ate and drank with avidity
it was hours since any of them had done either
as the sun rose higher the glare from the water dazzled their eyes and the heat increased till some of the sailors began to clamor for more water
men said jones addressing them we are sll in a terrible position and whether we shall ever get out of it i know not
that is in the hands of providence
of one thing however i can assure you the first man caught stealing ater will be shot
that was all he said but it had the effect of calming the men down and they endured in silence till sunset when a second distribution was made
jones himself took less than anyone
the british officer noticed this and offered to forego his own share but jones would not hear of it
it was about midnight when jimmv arose from a trou bled sleep and gazing about him made out a form by the water cask ri it was one of the rescued british sailors and he was in the act of repaying his saviors by filching from their scanty supply of water
jimmy was on him in an instant
a quick backward wrench of his hand sent the fellow sprawling
he was up in a minute though and jimmy caught the gleam of a knife in his hand as he came at him
there was no time for the young ensign to draw his weapon
the only thing to do was to grapple with the man
as they closed jimmy felt a sharp pain in his shoulder as though a redhot iron had been plunged into it
the britisher had used his steel to good effect
but he had not calculated on the strength of the young american
with all his might jimmy grasped the mans wrist and bent it slowly back till he was on his knees
then drop that knife
the blade rang to the deck
now look here said jimmy to his now helpless antagonist will spare your life this time but if ever you attempt such a thing again i shall shoot you like the dog you are
the fellow answered not a word but slunk over to the side of the raft on which his companions lay and was soon wrapped in apparent slumber
jimmy examined the spigot of the water keg
he turned it slightly so as to see if the british sailor had tampered with it
as his hand met the spigot he heard a loud shout behind him
it was the man he had just wrested the knife from
the young ensign was about to order the fellow away when he shouted at the top of his voice here he is
here is the fellow who steals the water while we are asleep
in a second everyone on the raft was wide awake and jimmy faced a score of accusing eyes
even jones was tempted for a moment to believe in the young ensigns guilt but one glance into the lads face and the ring of his voice as he exclaimed a lie convinced jones that his young ensign was guiltless of the base act of which he was accused
what have you to say about this he demanded sternly of the english sailor a sinisterlooking fellow the lower part of whose face was enveloped in a huge red beard
his small eyes dancing with hatred he pointed at jimmy as he replied saw him do it
a sensation ran through the men on the raft
if a trusted officer was to be detected in the act of stealing some of the precious water in whom could they place any reliance
jimmy said jones sorrowfully am afraid it looks pretty black against you my boy
you know when we all awoke you were by the keg and were in the act of turning the spigot
for sake commodore you donot think me guilty
let me hear your explanation
jimmy related the events as they had occurred
does that sound like the truth asked the redbearded sailor when the lad had finished
why mates he went on you all that he had his hand on the spigot when i called you
so that i could tell how much you had stolen you lying dog shouted jimmy
does that sound a likely story demanded the illfavored britisher
even jones was compelled to admit that it did not seem very credible
you know the penalty for such an act jimmy said the commander sadly
capt jones exclaimed the young ensign you are making a horrible mistake
surely surely you cannot think that i have done this thing
jimmy boy it looks black against you
do you mean that you are going to shoot me jones bowed his head
he could not trust himself to speak
deep confidence as he had in the lad he could not doubt but that tortured by the thirst that was beginning to torment them all the expowder monkey had been unable to resist the craving
jimmy buried his face in his hands donot mind the penalty commander he said bitterly for if you doubt me there is not much use in my living but you should know that i am not a liar
jimmy we would all be too glad to believe it but what were you doing by that water keg
that i have told you once
that is all the explanation you have to offer it is
the english sailor broke into a brutal laugh
his voting life will be snuffed out anyhow he remarked to a comrade near him
not just yet said a clear ringing voice as lieut
harkness strode up to jones
all stared at the english officers sudden interruption
jones looked at him interrogatively
you have evidence pointing to the guilty party he asked
yes
who is he there he stands the britisher pointed to the sailor who had accused jimmy
why did yen not speak before did not dream that matters were going to turn out so seriously besides was unwilling to see a countryman convicted of such a base act but i was forced to believe the evidence of my own eyes when i saw that man drink ing from the spigot of the water butt
a terrible change had come over the face of the bearded sailor as his officer had spoken
his florid features were overspread with a sickly gray
jones spoke to him sharply
come here
the fellow shuffled over to the young commander
what have you to say to this charge a lie
the tone in which he said it was enough to convict the man of falsehood but jones let him go a little further
you mean you were not at the water keg at all that is what i mean yes do not believe you
there are stains of water on the front of your shirt
the fellow looked down in terror
yes there they were beyond a doubt
several wet stains of the water that had dribbled from his mouth as he drank and they made a damning piece of evidence against him
jones face grew hard as steel as he looked at the cringing creature before him
he hated a sneak and above a sneak he abhorred a liar
the man who faced him was both
he turned to jimmy
give me your pistol
jimmy blanched
the fate he would not have hesitated to face himself he could not bear to be instrumental in bringing on another
jones saw his hesitation
come jimmy he said you cannot save the man by refusing me your weapon
but you surely do not mean to shoot him
as if he were a dog
did he think of the lives that depended on that water when he tried to steal it jimmy was forced to admit the justice of jones argu ment
without another word he handed him the pistol
jones pointed it at the shrinking wretch in front of him
if youliave anything to say speak now he said
the sailor broke into a torrent of blasphemy
jones checked him
do not revile in your last moments he said
the only answer was another burst of profanity then before jones could put himself on guard the frenzied man leaped full at him and buried his fingers in his throat
if i am to die by heavens you go with me lie shrieked in the tones of a madman
the fury of his assault sent jones staggering backward toward the edge of the raft
in another moment they were both struggling in the water
there is an old saying that there is no enemy as dan gerous as a desperate coward
jones struggled with all his might to free himself but the fellows fingers sunk deeper into his flesh
he felt his senses leaving him as completely exhausted he made a last effort to wrest himself from the madmans grasp
for the first few seconds after the two men had gone over the side jimmy and the others had stood paralyzed with amazement at the affair
as the young ensign saw the difficulties his commander was in however it required only the work of a moment for him to plunge into the water to the rescue
he threw his arm about the throat of jones assailant as the latter was about to sink for the last time and forced him back
as his head was wrenched round the fellow released his death grip on jones throat and turned his attention to jimmy do for you anyway you pup he hissed as he strove to grasp the boys windpipe i3 but jimmy was on his guard
he forced his arm under the others chin and together they sank
jimmy was too experienced a hand in the water not to have taken a good lungful of air before he went under
the other however had not and when they once more shot to the surface jimmy felt the form of the treacherous fellow limp in his arms
he felt his heart
it had stopped beating
the mans lips too were blue about the comers
he was dead beyond a doubt
nevertheless the men on the raft worked over him to try and fan some faint spark of vitality to life but at the end of an hour they saw that their efforts were useless
it was sundown of their second day on the raft that they consigned the body to the deep
shortly after they took their last drink from the keg and ate the last biscuit
if help did not come shortly they were doomed men
all that night they sat up on their frail floating platform and some of them prayed that aid would come before death claimed them
dawn however showed them the same monotonous level of rolling water without a sail to break the loneliness of the heaving waste
they spoke but little
men in their position have little to say for each is busy with his own thoughts
the wounded man groaned in his pain and implored them to give him a drop of water to moisten his parched throat
they dared not tell him that the water was all gone but with the strange intuition that comes sometimes to the dying he sat upright and pointing his finger at the keg screamed you have drunk it all you cursed thieves
you mean to leave me to die without a drop to ease my last hours
it was terrible to hear his ravings as he called down curses on the heads of the men who as he thought had deprived him of his share of the precious fluid
at last lie raised himself up and tried to drag his wounded body to the keg
the effort was too much for him and he fell exhausted halfway
they let him lie there until jones saw his position and tenderly lifted him back onto the pile of canvas that served him as a pillow
toward evening a tiny cloud appeared on the horizon
it spread with the rapidity of an ink spot on blotting paper and soon the whole heavens were overcast with a sooty pall of dark clouds
the castaways hailed this with expressions of thankfulness
it meant the one thing that might yet save their livesrain
presently a few heavy drops fell
they turned their faces with their mouths open eagerly up to the sky that they might not miss a drop of the blessed moisture we must catch some of this downpour and save it said tones who realized that they might still have many days of suffering to face ere a ship or death put an end to their miseries
the canvas from beneath the wounded mans head was spread so as to catch as much of the rain as possible
it leaked like a sieve and when the shower ceased only a few minutes after it had begun there was not more than a quart of dirty water to show for their pains
one of the sailors stepped up to jones
are you going to serve out that water now sir he asked respectfully enough yet with a note in his voice that jones did not like
you know well enough that this is to be kept for that poor fellow he said indicating the dying man who had cried so beseechingly for water that day
what we donot get none of it
not a drop my man
the sailor turned without a word and joined his mates
they talked together for a while in low tones
evdn in situations such as that in which the castaways found themselves men will form into cliques
this is for various reasons on land but among seamen there is the line that is drawn between forecastle and quarterdeck that nothing not pven the prospect of a terrible death can eliminate
so it was that the british officer was in the group comprising jones and his twoofficers not forgetting old bill cuff who held himself to be the equal of any quarterdeck pacer
the crew on the other hand formed a little body of their own
they outnumbered the officers two to one and were equally well armed
mark my word captain those fellows mean mischief said dale turning to jones
jones eyes snapped as he replied well if they think they are going to put tongue to that poor fellows water they are much mistaken mischief or no mischief am with you capt jones in this said the britisher hope that the fact that i am your prisoner will not prevent you from letting me draw my sword on your side if it comes to a tussle
not at all replied jones
if they do indeed intend to mutiny every sword we have will improve our chance of beating them off
at last the sailor who had approached jones before de tached himself from his fellows and once more approached the commodore
me and my mates has been talking this thing over he said and we have decided that the living has more right to the water than a fellow what canot last more than a few hours anyway
despite the veiled threat in the mans manner jones did not lose his temper
surely you would not have him pass his last hours tortured by the agonies of thirst he asked
we donot know nothing about that
we wants our rights
well what do you wish me to do
jones was sparring for time
he saw as soon as the man spoke that they were in for a fight and every moment he could avert it while he decided on some plan of action would be to their advantage
the man leered at him insolently
all the conventionality that marked the quarterdeck intercourse between officer and man was at an end now
the two groups of men were alone on a deserted sea on a tiny and frail raft
they were reduced to the situation of the primitive man to whom the battle for the necessities of life was a daily occurrence
well do we get the water
no ypu donot question and answer rang out sharp as rifle shots
well we mean to have it in spite of you capt paul jones
the young commanders fist shot out like a flash and the sailor who had addressed him was stretched on the flooring of the raft
his mates uttered a growl of rage as they advanced threateningly toward the group of officers i
they had drawn their sea knives and cutlasses and presented a formidable appearance compared to the group of officers who awaited their coming calmly
the man whom jones had knocked down lay like a stone as he had fallen
this put one of their foes out of the way
hold on men cried dale raising his hand to com mand attention have you considered what you are about to do
this is mutiny on the high seas
you canot frighten us with your threats growled one of the seamen not on your cursed quarterdeck now but here as man to man we mean to drive you into the sea if we donot get that water
well then you can try to drive us into the sea but i give you fair warning that if you attack us we will show you no mercy said jones
the men made a concerted rush at these words
the man who had addressed jones rushed straight at him and aimed a savage sweep of his great cutless at the young commanders head
jones blow and lunging ran the fellow clean through the body
at the same moment harkness the british officer ac counted for another sword was knocked out of his hand and the young ensign would have fared ijadly if it had not been for old bill cuff who seized the fellow who had struck the blow by the throat and hurled him into the sea as if he had been a stone
then the fighting grew so fast that none of the participants had time to observe the movements of the others
it was cut and thrust for dear life
the young britisher was wounded but fought doggedly on with the courage of his race and old cuff had got a slash over the arm
on the other hand they had accounted for fully half their opponents and now the officers were evenly matched
slowly they drove the mutineers back to the edge of the raft the men made a desperate sortie but their heart was gone and they lost two of their number in the assault
at last they threw down their arms and called for quarter
jones and his officers had won
at that moment jimmy exclaimed look
they followed his gaze and saw on the horizon a white sail
she was as yet only hull down but at the pace she was coming they soon made out that she carried royals and double spencers and was a craft of great speed
as she drew nearer she revealed a double row of black andwhite ports and a line of bright copper is a war ship exclaimed dale
beyond a doubt said jones but of what nation i cannot yet make out
harkness had remained silent since the sail had hove in sight
all at once however he gave a start and regarded the ship earnestly can set your doubts at rest as to what the nationality of yon ship is he said
they all leaned forward to catch his words
she is his majestys harpy and there on the horizon if my eyes do not deceive me are two corvettes and a brig of the same service
this was about as bad as it could be
the sloop had undoubtedly sighted them for she had backed her spencers and was rounding to as gracefully as a great swan know her skipper said harkness with a side glance at jones
he is a man named grimstone and as big a martinet as there is in the british navy
jones guessed his meaning
you mean that there will be a courtmartial on board her in the morning and the prisoner will be paul jones harkness hung his head he could not tell the man he had grown to admire that in all probability he would be hanged before dawn
the sloop was rounded to and brought up with beautiful precision within a cables length of the raft
a boat was lowered and came flying through the water toward the castaways
as she drew alongside a midshipman seated in the stern sheets hailed them
raft ahoy
what in blazes are you doing out here in hullo
ddfringer cried harkness is that really you
i last saw you on the old viet ary me right enough replied the shaver as the boat swfept alongside but are you charlie harkness and what on earth are you doing on this ark owe my life to this gentleman here replied harkness indicating jones
the middy bowed as he looked at jones
he suddenly stopped short in the midst of his saluta tion as his eye fell on jones uniform
rebel by thunder he exclaimed
old grimstone will be glad to hear of this
one of my men informs me that you are paul jones the rebel
is that a fact capt grimstone of the harpy drew his brows together as he looked hard at the man confronting him in the wardroom of the sloopofwar
it is true that i am paul jones was the reply
the pirate think you are making a mistake i am acting commodore of the american navy
we do not recognize such a navy
that is strange you have had opportunities enough for recognition
insolence will not help your cause sir had no intention of being insolent
i merely wished to point out what even you must admit to be a fact
the face of capt grimstone grew purple with rage at the calm tone of the man he was endeavoring to bully
very well sir if you do not choose to answer my questions you are under no obligations to do so
but i give you fair warning that i shall hold myself equally free and order you hanged at sunrise
paul jones regarded the man opposite him with steadfast gaze
is it according to the rules of civilized warfare to hang a man wdthout a trial he asked
in such a case as thisyes
england must clear the seas of such as you
england pays me a great compliment said jones bowing
capt face was a study
take him away he bellowed to the two marines who guarded the young american have him rigged as a jewel block by noon tomorrow or my names not grim stone
jones was marched back to the gloomy brig in which cuff and his two brother officers were confined
well said dale as the marines locked the doer what is it they mean to hang me at sunrise
an exclamation of horror burst from the lips of the others even a trial so it seems
you see i am a pirate and as such not entitled to the formality of a trial
who could have told them of your identity
one of the sailors we rescued from the threedecker i suppose
you donot think it was harkness am sure it was not am glad you have such implicit faith in him
for my part i am inclined to believe he was the man who did it jones drew a small piece of paper from his pocket
read this he said and perhaps you will alter your opinion
at midnight read the note the watch is changed
your lock is a simple one and easily filed
i will convey the tools to you
do not despair
you saved my life will save yours
dale laid the letter down with an exclamation of astonishment
it is from him
yes
how do you know because he handed it to me as i passed him on the way to the wardroom
that was the reason it was not found on you when we were searched
exactly
the only thing to do now is to wait till eight bells and see if lieut
harkness carries out his promise
the hours went slowly by while outside their prison they could hear the monotonous tramp of the sentry
at last they heard a sharp challenge and harkness voice saying must see the prisoners
the door of the brig was at once thrown open and the young officer entered
he spoke to the prisoners in a sharp voice am sent to see if you have anything to say before your sentence of death is executed upon you prisoner paul jones he said in a brusque tone
jones stepped up to him
no sir you can tell your commander that i have nothing but contempt for the man who will take advantage of such a chance as brought me into his hands
that is all you have to say
that is all am sorry if you will give your parole that you will keep to the poop deck you may not be hanged till we land in old england will never pledge my word to stay voluntarily on board a british war ship
jones saw the drift of the young officers talk
he was waiting till the sentry should have passed che door after which he would npt return for a good fifteen minutes for the door of the brig was strong and it was not deemed necessary to watch the prisoners very closely
indeed the british never dreamed of men penned as the yankees were making the attempt
as soon as the sentrys footsteps had died away harkness extended his hand
jones grasped it and the british officer slipped something hard and cold to the other
it was a file
then from the bosom of his loose deck coat he produced two longbarreled pistols and a brace of cutlasses
these were all i could get he explained but they may help you if it comes to a tussle
he grasped jones hand once more
capt jones he said am an englishman and i suppose your natural enemy but we may never meet again and i want to express to you my hopes for your welfare and he stopped
oh hang formality he exclaimed the next moment and good luck to you all
the next moment he was gone
the four men in the cell looked at one another
there goesa man said dale
the others nodded
as for jones his heart was too full to speak for a moment they soon had the lock fastenings filed away so that it would be possible for them to remove it at will
nothing now remained to be done but to wait till the watch was changed
before he left harkness had slipped jones another note
the american opened it and found that it contained the information that the harpy was towing her longboat astern
you can slip over the stem and into her said the writer and with decent luck get away
it seems a desperate chance said dale a sight better than being clapped into an english prison at any rate growled old cuff
s so say echoed jimmy
say remarked cuff after a brief silence what about the two niggers jones laughed
oh they have gone back to the galley he said am under no apprehension that they will not be treated well for the britishers needed a doctor well its a relief to think that we wonot be hampered with them said cuff who had never fbrgiven scipio and gato for the accident to the soup
eight bells chimed out sharp and clear
so far as the four prisoners could judge from the motion of the vessel it was a calm night which was so much the better for them if they could only get into the boat
silently as a thief jones wrenched off the filed lock and liberty faced the four americans
grasping their cutlasses and the precious pistols in a determined grip they crept along the dark tween decks
capt grimstone was a great economist and did not provide lanterns for the lower decks of his sloop except in time of action
it was this fact which saved the lives of jones and his followers for as they advanced from behind a bulkhead they came full on the two sentries stealing a smoke in the embrasure of a gun
they drew back without a sound and the men went on smoking afterward walking to the port and looking out at the sea and talking after the manner of sentimental sailors of their sweethearts in the green lanes of england
now was their time and silently as cats the yankees slipped up the companion
they crouched in the shelter of its hood for a moment
after a cautious reconnoitering of the deck however they deemed it was safe to make their dash for freedom
the night was as dark as a pocket and this fact un doubtedly saved them from discovery
for although they could not see him they could distinctly hear the tramp tramp of the lookout in the bow
they crept aft keeping carefully in thd shadow of the bulwarks
suddenly jones foot encountered something soft
the something uttered a grunt
it was a man
without a moments hesitation jones seized him by the throat and choked him into insensibility
it was no time for half measures
after this they met with no obstacle till they came to the ladder leading to the poop deck
they had either to climb this with the risk of being seen or creep through the main cabin and drop out of the stern windows
they decided on the cabin
they had crossed it the soft carpet not making a sound and were wrenching open one of the big stern windows that ships of that day were fitted with when there came an interruption
a man carrying a lantern came out of one of the berths opening off the main cabin
jones recognized him at was capt grimstone
the yankee sprang at him like a tiger
the british captain struggled manfully but it was no use
jones was too much for him
cuff got some rope out of a locker and they gagged him by stuffing jones handkerchief in his mouth i8 there they left him like a trussed turkey and as angry as a wet hen wonot need him till tomorrow laughed dale as they scrambled through the window
no but he will have to postpone that hanging he was looking forward to so eagerly i fancy replied jones as he followed
they felt about with their feet for a rope
there was one dangling from the stern that they located without any difficulty
it seemed so handy that they guessed their friend hark ness must have placed it there
one after the other they slid down it and into the boat
as soon as they were all on board jones raised his cutlass
harpy he said as he cut the painter when next we meet paul jones may be arranging a neck tie party of his own
at this moment there came loud shouts from the sloop which was fast vanishing in the night
they must have found capt grimstone said cuff with a grin
well if they donot take it into their heads to look for the boat we are all right replied jones
apparently the britishers did not take it into their heads to look for the boat for the cries died away and the little craft was alone on the sea
do you not see some object out there to leeward sir
ensign downs of the american pallas asked the question of capt crawford
the young officers superior brought his telescope to bear on the object indicated
why bless my soul
mr downs he exclaimed a boat boat exclaimed the other incredulously
yes an open boat and as i live there are human be mgs aboard of her
they are waving to us
tell the sailing master to change our course so as to bring us down on her
the ensign hurried to obey the order
shall i signal the concord sir
no said the captain glancing at his consort which lay a short distance to windward for she has sighted them too and is heading for them
who can they be sir do you think have no idea unless possibly part of the crew of the threedecker we sank just after poor paul jones and his ship were lost
do you know sir i canot help thinking that in spite of our fears capt jones will turn up all right
let us hope so my boy
we do not know but that he may have got away in the fog
then might that not be his boat the captain shook his head
so far as i can see she is a britisher
their boats are always painted as is this one
from her build though she evidently belonged to a manofwar
hullo hullo he broke off excitedly that
it cannot beyes it is though
cheer boys
cheer for all youre worth he cried turning to the crew
paul jones is safe and in yonder boat
a deafening broke from the throats of the men at the news that their beloved commander was safe
surely no boat was ever lowered more briskly than the one that dropped from the side of the pallas a moment after capt crawford had recognized the young leader of the american navy
half an hour later jones with his officers was seated in the wardroom of the pallas narrating his experiences with the british and receiving the congratulations of high and low
they had only drifted in the boat for a day and that they had been picked up so quickly by the pallas was ac counted for by the fact that the american ships had spent the time since the supposed loss of their commodore in cruising about the neighboring ocean in the hope that they might find some trace of his fate
the day was one of general rejoicing
seated on the capstan head old cuff entertained the crew with a full and not too veracious narrative of their adventures
his account served to fan the flame of the mens hatred for the british and not a soul before the mast on either of the yankee ships but was eager to tackle the kings fleet once more
jones and his officers had decided after a consultation to head for the coast of france
they knew that the british fleet was somewhere between them and the land of gaul but they trusted to the nimbleness of their wits to escape them
from where they now lay it was a sail provided the wind held fair of only a few days before they could reach the french coast
to reach america on the other hand would take some weeks
as it was absolutely necessary to refit their craft it was decided to run into some port on the west coast of france
a course was accordingly laid and a few days later they entered the channel
the english channel was at that time as it is at the present day one of the most thoroughly patrolled pieces of water in the world
the yankee commander hardly expected to gpt through without encountering some british ship doing police work but he hoped to get by through the exercise of his native wit
during a calm which fell when they were still some three hundred miles wet of the scilly islands the men were set to work painting out the ports on the side of the two yankee ships and mussing up their running gear and generally smart appearance till they looked like two tired old geordies home from a cruise to the west indies
thus disguised theyslipped past the lizard and into sacred water
about the middle of the second day when with royals all rove any fashion and topsails timidly reefed they were rolling down the channel a dandy frigate of the british line hove in sight
from topmasts to kelson she spoke of discipline
there was written to the eye of the sailor in every halyard and in the graceful set of her masts
down she bowled until she lay to within a few cables lengths of jones disguised craft
then she backed her topsails and losing way settled as gracefully as a resting swan on the rolling seas
an officer resplendent in gold lace and brass buttons leaped to her rail
ship ahoy
where are you from jones who with the rest of his officers had donned old sea togs and no more resembled the scrupulously neat and dashing american naval hero answered in a piping voice out forty days from are you
his majestys frigate bcllona
heave to well send a boat wait were in a hurry
hurry be hanged was the reply
heave to and look sharp about it or well let daylight into your ugly bones
jones waved his hand in true geordie fashion to signify that iff would obey and the topsails were swung round till the pallas was stationary
the concord followed suit and soon the two vessels were as motionless as the frigate
a boat came skimming over the waves and a dandy young officer stepped superciliously up in the stem sheets your gangway my man he asked sharply you see the ladder asked jones that good enough for you my man
none of your impudence my fine fellow or well send you to the bottom without much ceremony said the young officer as he placed his foot on the ladder and proceeded to climb up the side
he got his varnished boots ducked as the pallas gave a heavy roll and this did not improve his temper
pall he said as he gained the deck how these tubs do smell to be sure
i really donot see how these fellows support life
now my good man will you bring your papers here on deck
for i really cannot go into that stuffy cabin of yours
jones bowed and brought out in a tin box the set of papers that had been carefully forged for just such an emergency
the officer turned them over with a gloved hand
yes yes theyre all right i suppose and now as we are shorthanded i shall need some of your crew
it was the custom in those days for a nation when at war to stop even the ships flying her own ensign and impress as it was called as many of her crew as she happened to need
jones was therefore fully prepared for this and acceded to the others request with alacrity
the young officer was somewhat surprised that jonesoffered no resistance to his demand but as he had sized him up as a simple fellow he did not see anything suspicious in it
jones excused himself and stepped below
he whispered something to each man of the crew and soon the british officers boat was loaded to the gunwales with roughlooking sailors with no suggestion of trained fighters about them
among them but in their disguises looking no different from the rest were jones and dale
under their loose smocks each man was armed to the teeth and in nowise was there anything about them to suggest that they were anything but what the young officer thought thema fine body of merchant sailors
well captain said the officer to jones as the boat rode over the waves on her return journey am sorry to have to do this but you see we are at war now and if we can rid the atlantic of this fellow jones the yankee admiral as he calls himself why so much the better for you merchantmen
jones nodded
just the same he said feel it will be my duty to protest to your captain so that i can enter it truthfully in the log to account to the owners for my delay
well of course that is as you like said the britisher as the boat scraped the frigates side am sure sir frederick de vere our captain will be delighted to see you
jones bowed once more and followed by his crew climbed up the gangway onto the deck of the frigate
she was a magnificent vessel and evidently commanded by a man who prided himself on his discipline
her decks were white as snow and from the tedpainted tompions of her guns to the snowy hammocks lashed along her rails she was as spick and span as a quakeress
the young officer who had commanded the boat which impressed jones crew led the supposed merchant captain aft to the cabin under the poop deck
he ushered him with a bow into the luxurious cabin of the aristocratic commander and with a word of introduction and another bow left them
a sir frederick de vere was an officer of the type who believed in the oldfashioned methods of doing things
he eyed jones with marked disapproval as the disguised yankee captain stumped with his clumsy sea boots on the soft turkey carpet
aw my good man stand on the deck if you please
jones obeyed
aw you want to speak to meaw
yes i wish to protest against the highhanded man ner in which my crew have been pressed by your frigate
well my good person you are at perfect liberty toawprotest that but it wonot do you a pennorth of goodaw
no
jones was mildly interrogative
no i can assure you no
and now if you have finished you have the goodness to remove yourself from one moment captain exclaimed jones stepping quickly to the rear window of the cabin and dragging a strip of white linen from his breast as he did so
why my good man
what impertinence
what do you want to do want you to stand in that corner
the drawl was gone from the supposed limejuicers voice and the words snapped from his lips like shots from a musket
the indignant commander turned like a flash
he faced a pistol held in the hand of the man he had fancied a harmless old dodderer
why i never heard of such impertinence he gasped
who are you r paul jones whipped out the man with the gun
the guns of my two ships are trained on this vessel out of the window i am holding a strip of white linen that i shall wave if i want them to fire a broadside at you
the old captain made a move move or blow your brains out
sir frederick sank back in a chair he could hardly believe his senses
his frigate captured by a vagabond yankee pirate he pinched himself to see if he was awake
now go to that port opening on the deck and order your watch below
quick or i may not give you a chance
sir frederick hurried to the port
order the watch below he said to the officer of the deck
order them below sir echoed that functionary sur prised out of his usual unquestioning obedience
jones pistol pressed the cold rim of its barrel at the nape of the old baronets neck said order them below sir he repeated with great alacrity
the officer gave the order
no sooner had the last man disappeared down the forecastle than one of the crew of the pallas made fast the hatch and imprisoned them while dale presenting a pis tol to the amazed officers head said he would trouble him for his weapons
there was a glint in the eye of the first luff of the pallas that the britisher knew meant obey and he gave up his sword and pistol like a lamb
the other officers were soon overpowered and then jones ordered a boat provisioned and lowered
one by one the indignant british officers were lowered into it and a knife given them to cut their bonds with
sir frederick was the last to go
if he could have spoken much new profanity would have been added to the language of the sea but words failed him and he merely looked as if he were about to suffer a fit of apoplexy
as soon as the boat had received her load of brassbuttoned and goldlaced britishers the yards of the frigate were swung round and she slowly gathered way followed by the pallas and the concord
as the cloths filled old cuff stepped nimbly aft and drawing from his blouse the flag jones always used the sign of the coiled rattlesnake he bent it on the halyards
as it broke out at the peak the other two yankee ships fired a deafening salute and the cheers of the sailors rent the air
what the boatful of british officers felt as they slowly drifted astern it would be difficult to portray
they stood up in the boat as fast as they severed their bonds and shook their fists with vehement language at jones and the craft they had lately officered
jones mounted on the poop rail waved his hat in valediction as the bellona heeled to the freshening wind excite yourselves gentlemen he cried you will soon fall in with some ship to rescue you and in the meantime think over the american navy and what it stands for
by sunset the boat was a speck on the horizon and the three yankee ships for the bellona was now rated as an american craft were bowling along for the friendly shores of france
they picked up the coast early the next morning and by night found themselves off vigo bay
this was a great deal further south than jones had meant to come but the wind had blown them off their course
during the night however the wind grew stiffer and by dawn it was blowing great guns
the yankee captain decided to run for the coast and try and slip into some shelter
a survey of the chart showed them that there was a good anchorage to be found in the little harbor of st vincent and accordingly they ran for it
off the coast of st vincent there stretches a long natural breakwater of shoal sand but there is a good channel and jones fleet got through and into the smooth water beyond in safety
they lay at the mouth of a river which flowed past the little town and in order to be out of the reach of prying british ships jones decided to take his ships well up into the estuary
they laid here two days till the gale blew itself out and then decided to refit the pallas whose mainmast was badly sprung before putting to sea again
during their stay in the port the men amused themselves ashore in the quaint streets of the oldfashioned town
jimmy was frequently ashore with the others and found much to interest him in the place
to get from the wharf to the main part of the little town it was necessary to take a narrow and illlighted street that was an ideal place for villainy of all kinds
one night when jimmy was passing through this on his way back to the boats he heard the scream of a woman from one of the dark alleys that branched off
the lad was not a moment in making up his mind to go to her assistance
pistol in hand he raced up the dark passage from whence the cry had sounded
in the light which streamed from the halfopen door of a low wine shop he saw a young and apparently beautiful woman struggling in the arms of four or five huge ruffians of the worst type
they were evidently trying to abduct her but in that low quarter of the town the scresgns of women and the groans of the assassinated were such common sounds after nightfall that no particular attention was paid to either one or the other
the young american hurled himself like a thunderbolt into the midst of the ruffians
one of them clutched him by the throat but his pistol spoke and the man fell back dead
his fist shot out and landed full in the face of one of the others
the other two after a few blows took to their heels and jimmy found himself alone with the girl he had rescued
she was a magnificent creature of the darkest type of brunette and was evidently not muck more than seventeen
her full figure however was that of a woman and there was a light in her eyes and a look on her face as she held it up to her rescuer in the flickering light of the wine shop that told jimmy although he was not a boy who had seen much of the seamy side of life that she had seen and knew things that a girl of her years should not
the girl looked up at the broadshouldered youth with his healthy seatanned face with a look of more than mere gratitude in her dark eyes
it seemed to jimmy too that she held his hand rather longer than was essential to mere thankfulness
how brave you are senor americano she whispered attempting to lay her head on his shoulder although the boy drew back know you are an americano for i have often watched you as you came from the ships in the river
jimmy felt his cheeks bum at the girls almost open words of love
it was nothing he said gently removing the girls hand from his arm it is the custom of my countrymen to go to the assistance of any woman who is in distress
ah but they are all not as brave as you senor the girl whispered once more patting his arm with her soft fingers
oh yes they are said jimmy smiling at the girls open admiration and now if you like i will escort you to your home as soon as you are ready for it is time i returned to the ship
the girl threw back her head and laughed as she gazed at the frank face of the young sailor
you think that i am not safe senor donot think the streets are the place for a girl like you at this time of night said jimmy
mats il est drole
know you not my little senor of la belle francesca
no replied jimmy truthfully enough
the girl once more threw back her head showing her full white throat
then she struck an attitude moil my little boy i am the belle francesca
the spanish dancer and i like you
to say that jimmy was taken by surprise at this avowal on the part of the beautiful creature half spanish and half french with the wild beauty of both races would be to put it mildly
he was about to speak when before he uttered a word of protest the girl had slipped her warm bare arms about his neck and pressed her lips to his
before he could protest a rasping voice cut through the night behind him
upon my word a very pretty tableau i am sorry to have to spoil itthus
the swish of a heavy knife sounded in ear as the man who had witnessed the involuntary embrace he had received aimed a vicious blow at him
jimmy caught the arm of his wouldbe assassin as it hurtled down and bent it back till the wrist bones cracked
the man with a howl of pain dropped the knife which jimmy contemptuously chucked over an adjacent wall
so francesca this is the way you repay my trust in you hissed the newcomer who was a sinisterlooking fellow muffled in a long dark cloak
oh it is you is it
spy replied the girl her head thrown defiantly back and her eyes flaming with rage as she regarded the other
yes it is i who havethank the saintscaught you in your perfidy but enough of this
senor americano goodnight
the next time we meet i may have the upper hand
as for you you hussy come with me
the young american hesitated at leaving the girl who ever she might be alone with such a ruffian as the man had shown himself but as she saw his hesitancy divined its cause she broke into her wild laugh and ex claimed have no fear for me senor i can twist this gentleman round my little finger
this was all the assurance jimmy wanted and with a bow he took his way to the wharf
as soon as the sound of his footsteps had passed out of hearing the man turned to the girl with a grating voice asked her how she had come to meet the american and what she meant by kissing him
for answer the girl bestowed fully as warm an embrace on the wouldbe murderer of the young american as she had on her rescuer himself be an old silly she said reaching up and patting his cheek the young fellow saved me from a band of ruffians and i did but reward him
hum was the muttered reply you had better keep such rewards for those who know you better
so the american was from the ship of paul jones he asked with a sudden change of the subject
yes but why do you ask because listen francesca because there is much to be made out of this american sailor
the english call him a pirate the americans a patriot
i care not which he is
but as you know i have lost heavily at your fathers gaming tables of late and i must recoup my losses
yes you have said all this a thousand times before what is your new plan do not mock me but listen
you know or perhaps you do not that the british admiral on behalf of his gov emment has offered a large reward for information that will lead to the capture of the bold yankee they fear
you mean that you will give the information
yes and then when i am rich you will marry me
and become the wife of a traitor
you forget that this country is an ally of the united states
that matters little
i hate these cursed yankees
they have beaten me at everything and now they are trying to beat me at love
curse them but i know a way to rid myself of them and tonight i will take the lugger and tell the british admiral where he can lay his finger on master paul jones and the rest of the yankee pigs
impossible
besides the british fleet is nowhere near here
it is nearer than you think
they were oft st malo last week and were cruising south
they do say that a that jones escaped from in is the instigator of the chase
you are determined to go then
yes i must have this money come what may
the girl shrugged her shoulders at his words and they parted she taking the street that led to her house he to the wharf
the first rays of the dawn were gilding the bay when a fishing lugger shot from the harbor and tumbling heavily in the roll of the big waves outside headed for the open sea
in her sat the man of the cloak
he was accompanied by two other men to attend to the handling of the lugger
the little vessel was a speedy craft and at sunset that night she was in view of the british fleet
it was almost midnight however before they laid to alongside a tall threedecker
as soon as it was light the citizen of saint demanded an interview with the admiral
the sentry at the top of the gangway frowned at him when he made the request but when he added that it concerned paul jones he was speedily conducted aft
he found the admiral engaged at breakfast but the great man was not too busy to draw back his chair and ask him to tell his story
as the man concluded his narrative the old admiral looked at an officer across the table from him
well grimstone he said it looks this time as if we really have our man bottled
now you will be able to revenge that trussing he gave you
the other colored furiously
the fleet had heard of his adventure with jones and a smile went round the cabin at the admirals allusion to it trust we shall meet him sir grimstone contented himself with saying he and i have an old score to settle
let the fleet make sail at once said the admiral when the amusement had subsided
they will follow my ship and this fellow here shall act as pilot
the lover of francesca made some show of demurring to this
and if you try to play us false or if i even suspect you of double dealing i will have you shot like a dog added the admiral as the fellow turned gray with terror at the prospect hour the fleet was under way with every man on board confident that at last they had trapped the tiger of the atlantic
a francesca lost no time the next morning in going to the wharf and getting a boatman to row her out to the pallas
she found everything in a state of confusion on board the smart little craft
she knew very little english and therefore had some difficulty in finding jimmy but at last she recognized him and flew to his side while the men winked knowingly at one another
poor jimmy was much embarrassed at the caresses of the beautiful creature publicly bestowed as they were and lost no time in conducting her to the main cabin where he introduced her to jones for she had explained to him that she had important news of the greatest interest to the american commander
she prefaced her remarks by telling the commander that what she did was only done for sake which almost made that modest youth flee the cabin
she then related all that her lover had said and threatened and added that he had left the harbor that morning
that must have been his lugger we saw jimmy said jones only wish we had known who was in it and what he was after said the ensign ruefully and we could have kept our whereabouts a secret till we had that hew mast stepped
how long will it take to finish the work we cannot get it done till after dark tonight
jones stamped his foot impatiently
that means that we are to be bottled up here till the british please to dash in and annihilate us
unless we choose to dash out first
ah that is the plan
you have the mast ready on time jimmy and we will try and give them the slip once more
as francesca was rowed back to the shore she stood up and kissed her hand to jimmy till to his great relief her boat reached the wharf
jones and dale took a walk out to the hills above the town that afternoon and spent the time watching the sea with the ships telescope
it was getting dusk when after a prolonged scrutiny jones handed the glass to dale
you take a look dale there to the northwest and tell me what you think of them
the first lieutenant gazed for some seconds at the point of the horizon his commander had indicated
it is the british all right he said do you make their force dale
as far as i can see three ships of the line and some smaller fry what i make them
well we donot need to worry about the little fellows but the big chaps will give us a tussle unless we can slip past them
you think we can outsail them am sure of it the bellona by the way we must find a new name for heris one of the fastest ships i ever trod the deck of and the other two can outsail any of these clumsy threedeckers
they retraced their way to the ships and found that the work of refitting had made giant strides during the afternoon under the influence of the news that the british fleet was coming
the english prisoners had all been put to work and as they toiled there was a look in their eyes that showed that they confidently believed thatby nightfall they would all be back on their old ships once more another visit to the lookout hill after dark had fallen and had the satisfaction of observing the riding lights of the british at the mouth of the river
they are waiting for us as a spider waits for the fly she knows she has in her power he thought
well we shall see if the fly may not get out this time
i wish though he mentally added we could get hold of that fellow who went out in a lugger
i think we could interest him for a time
when he once more boarded his ship he ordered out his cutter
you are going to reconnoiter asked dale
yes i have a fancy to see the britishers at close range
in this light they will think that we are fishermen
the boat flew down the river urged by the powerful strokes of the men
not far from where jones little squadron was anchored was an old schooner lying on the mud
to surprise the young commander seemed to take the greatest interest in this venerable craft
he ordered the boat pulled alongside of her
she will float at high tide he observed to dale
so i noticed today sir but what of it it will save the trouble of towing her off
what you want her do
what do you expect to do with her
get out of this trap was jones reply given with a quizzical look
dale however seemed so tortured by curiosity that the young commodore leaned over and whispered something to him so that the men who were pulling the boat could not hear
dale seemed to be greatly pleased at his commanders communication and slapped his knee as he exclaimed capital
the very thing
they spent some time at the mouth of the river lying in near the bank where they were certain of not being observed and watching the lights flitting over the water as the ships boats pulled from one vessel of the fleet to another
they found that the observation of the number of ships in the squadron they had made from the hill was correct
hello said jones suddenly pointing to a small sloopsofwar that lay moored dose inshore that fellow has a familiar look to me
by jove its the harpy
dale donot you recognize your old friend
dale looked at the vessel
there was no doubt of it
it was the ship from which they had escaped
this is capt chance to get even with me for spoiling his hanging remarked jones with a laugh as they pulled back to the pallas
may heaven grant that we disappoint them all once more said dale
the rest of the time till midnight was spent by the yankees in transferring bags of some substance which they handled with the greatest care and barrels of tar and pieces of canvas to the abandoned schooner
tn fact by the time the tide began to turn they had stowed away a regular cargo on her
at midnight the tide was high and the schooner which had been fitted with sails and been painted up till she looked like a war ship began to glide slowly down the river
but one man stood on her decks
the night was too dark to reveal his features but he evidently was under no apprehensions of the british for he lolled at the wheel as the ship slid along with as much nonchalance as if he had been steering a load of garden stuff to market instead of piloting a ship down a river the mouth of which was policed by the british patrol fleet a keen observer would have noticed however that he did not as was the custom among sailors smoke anything
instead he hummed a tune of old virginia and the water lapping against the dingy sides of the rickety old craft he steered was the accompaniment
close behind the refitted schooner crept the pallas and the and the big bellow
the former was slightly in the lead
as the man on the schooner came within sight of the british vessels he dropped his nonchalant air and ran swiftly forward to the stem of his old craft
he disappeared down the forescuttle from which a faint glow was presently visible
the next moment he reappeared and running swiftly to the stern plunged overboard
he swam to the bellona whose sails had been noiselessly lowered through greased falls and clambered on board by the main chains
thank god you are back safe captain exclaimed dale as he wrung the hand of his commander for the man who had piloted the mysterious schooner down the river was none other than paul jones the man the british had dubbed the tiger of the atlantic
thank you dale he said as he shook the water out of his clothes and now to put the second part of our plot into execution
s as he spoke there was a burst of flame from the bow of the schooner and the loud report of a gun
how did you arrange the lanyard of the gun asked dale in amazement at the firing of the gun from the now deserted schooner
by tying a piece of rope yarn to the lanyard and the rope attaching a piece of rock and throwing the whole thing over the side
when the rock in trailing along the bottom struck a submerged obstacle it jerked the lanyard and fired the gun the report of the cannon had set the british fleet in an uproar
the sittings of battle lanterns about their decks showed the active preparations they were making to meet paul jones for they did not doubt that the schooner was one of his fleet
in the meantime the craft that had caused all the excitement drifted silently on until she was almost abreast of the big threedeckers
then she was seen to change her course and run right in between two of them because of the peculiarities of the tide
the britishers were taken aback by such boldness but they saluted her with a broadside that seemed as if it would blow her out of the water
she kept right on however and before the two bulky ships could get way on them they had locked yards with her
at the same moment a tongue of livid flame crept from her hold and licked hungrily at the masts
then the truth burst on the british
they were locked inextricably with a fireship
hardly a second elapsed from the time the first bluish flame had crept from the hold full of tar and oil the fireship carried before great yellow sheets of fire were shooting high into the air
the british fought like demons to shove off from their deadly foe but their spars were already on fire and the men were leaping overboard in wild terror
higher and higher shot the flames and the roar of the fierce volcano could be heard as far as the town
the glare lit up the sea as by day and in the midst of the panic that had fallen on the british the sea eagle made his swoop
out from the mouth of th river dashed his three vessels
before the british knew what was happening they were upon them and hurling their deadly iron rain right and left
suddenly a terrific explosion rent the air
the fire on the schooner had reached the powder bags with which her hold was partly filled and she had blown up
the explosion sent a perfect rain of flaming embers and redhot bolts over the rest of the vessels
jones ships were undamaged for before going into action the sails and spars had been thoroughly wetted down to avoid their catching fire from the blazing rain
it was far otherwise with the british however
their ships caught on fire in a dozen places at once and their crews had to leave the guns to fight the flames that threatened to destroy them
in the thick of the inferno of flames and noise and smoke one of the great threedeckers the one that had bepn undamaged drifted down on jones ship and opened a grueling fire on her
on the other side was jones old enemy the harpy
he had never been in a worse position
from both sides the iron hail was hurled into his ship till it seemed she must be torn apart
the night was lit up by the wild light of the burning ships and never did battlefield more resemble the infernal regions than did the scene about the three vessels that lay locked together and fighting handtohand
men stripped to the waist and stained with blood and powder manned the guns with a frenzy bom of the desperate nature of the fight
from time to time a man fell at his gun with the rammer in his hand and in a moment another would have snatched it up and prodded the charge home
the decks were slippery with blood and dim with smoke
the acrid reek of burned powder was thick over everything and the smoke from the burning ships dimmed mens eyes and choked their throats
in the midst of this inferno while the cannon belched their deadly contents a chance bullet shot down the coiled rattlesnake flag of america from the peak of the bellona
it was paul jones himself who snatched up the fallen flag and springing into the shrouds amid a hailstorm of bullets fastened it once more to the halyards and ran it aloft
a cheer broke from the tired men at the guns as they witnessed the heroic deed of their young leader
the sight of the gallant flag once more waving amid the thickhanging smoke lent the yankees fresh courage
cheering they beat back the boarders from the threedecker and led by jones advanced to drive back the horde of british bluejackets that were pouring over the side from the harpy
jones himself sword in hand led the men on
with a cheer they fell on their enemies who gave way without more ado
their leader alone a grayhaired man stood his ground you know me sir he demanded forcing his way to jones
the american instantly recognized him
it was capt grimstone
he rushed at jones with a furious lunge of his sword but the young sea eagle had no difficulty in parrying the thrust
after a few passes the englishman was disarmed and at jones mercy
his sword lay on the deck where jones skillful twist had sent it
the old man gazed sorrowfully at jones for a moment then he turned his eyes on his ship
the american flag now fluttered there in place of the british ensign
the same sight met his eye when he turned it on the threedecker
you have bested us fairly sir he said in a broken voice stooping to pick up his sword take the blade of a heartbroken man and your prisoner
jones returned the sword with a chivalrous bow will not deprive of his sword a man who knows so well how to use it he said with a touch of the charm of manner that so endeared him to all
hurray shouted bill cuff at this moment the british have struck their colors to the pallas and the concord and weve won the battle
wild cheers rose on every side at the announcement
jones held up his hand to check the noisy rejoicing
hush boys he said remember that there are brave men dying all about us
a after a short time had been spent in putting the vessels in trim for the long voyage to america jones decided to pay a brief visit to paris and make a report of the battle to benjamin franklin the american minister
accordingly with jimmy and dale he set out for the french capital about a week after the events described in the lastchapter
after a hard days ride they pulled up on the first night of their journey at a little roadside inn
the landlord seemed a surly fellow and did no appear to be any the more willing when sdpio who with cato had been rescued from the harpy by jones told him that his guest was none other than the famous paul jones
he appeared however to take the greatest interest in his guests movements after he knew who the dashing young traveler was
they retired early for they were much fatigued with the hard ride of the day
it was about midnight when jones was awakened by a slight sound in his room
there was a bright moon shining through the window and by its light he saw a face intently regarding him through the aperture
he recognized it as that of the surly landlord
the fellow disappeared almost as soon as jones had discovered him
he was not gone long however for he reappeared in a few minutes
he put one leg over the sill and climbed silently as a cat into the room
jones saw that he held in his hand a gleaming knife
he crept cautiously toward the bed holding his weapon partly concealed
jones was unarmed for he had left his weapons downstairs
he decided in a flash to pretend to be asleep and seize the man when he should have actually reached the bedside
the fellow crept on his tiptoes across the room
in a few seconds more he was at jones side
the american snored loudly in his effort to make the man think he was really asleep
the rascal seemed to be in no hurry for before he made any other move he went through the pockets of jones clothes and removed his wallet
the american saw his opportunity and pounced on the fellow as he leaned over his clothes
jones had the agility of a cat and his leap brought him on the fellows back
the man was too thoroughly taken by surprise to offer much resistance
in another moment jones had wrested his knife from him and had thrown it out of the window
mercy mercy implored the man
his eyes were almost starting out of his head in the extremity of his terror swear
i only intended to rob you exclaimed the innkeeper me if i resisted i suppose
the man did not reply
jones was filled with unutterable loathing for the man who would have murdered him and at least intended to rob him
go he said in tones of disgust for such a man as you i have nothing but contempt
you arc safe from my swprd or any harm from me for such a wretch as you works out his own punishment
the man rose to his feet as jones released him and stood before him as abject a figure as could be imagined
he looked the miserable sneak that he was
capt jones he said holding down his head will repay your kindness by giving you warning of a great danger that threatens you on the road to paris great danger that threatens me repeated jones
man you cannot frighten me with such a tale as that
it is true i swear it was the reply
the mans manner impressed jones although hi still suspected that the other was lying
well go on he said
when you broke up the british fleet you did not take all of the englishmen prisoners was the reply
no that is true several of them escaped under cover of the battle smoke and reached the shore
you are right
they were here last night and with them was a man of st vincent a dark man you know him
perhaps go on
he had evidently news of importance for he rode up shortly after they arrived and they at once asked for a private room
yes
well they remained in there some time and considered it my duty to know what was going on and listened at the door to their conversation
the man told them of your proposed visit to paris and the road you would take
it is true that anyone in st vincent might have known of that for it was no secret
it would have been better for you paul jones had it been
they decided to waylay you in this inn tonight and kill you for the reward the british government has offered for you alive or dead
the mans manner would not permit jones to longer doubt him
it bore every evidence of sincerity
suddenly the fellow listened intently
hark he exclaimed
jones cocked his ear and listened
the night was very still and the silence was only broken at intervals by the bark of some distant dog
as they listened neither of them scarcely breathing another sound was borne to their ears
it was the galloping of fastapproaching horses
there seemed to be quite a number of them
nearer and nearer they came
it is your wouldbe assassins exclaimed the innkeeper with blanched cheeks
there is no time to be lost then said jones how many of them are there
twenty at least
they are well armed too
you have pistols
yes two
good
now go and call the others
in a few seconds dale and jimmy with cato and scipio who were as badly frightened as on the day of the battle with the vengeance were in the room
the landlord had told them the reason of the midnight summons so that there was no necessity for wasting time in asking questions
the landlord had also brought jones pistol and sword
jones clapped the weapon to the fellows head
you will get your two pistols and use them too or i will reconsider the matter of a few moments ago and scatter your rascally brains
the fellow shivered for fighting was not much to his liking yet he saw no way out of the dilemma but to comply
the horsemen had nearly reached the inn the doors of which had been barricaded in expectation of their coming
jones went to the window as they rode up and in the bright moonlight saw that the landlord had not lied about their numbers
there were at least twenty of them
the silvery light shone on the steel of swords and pistols
jones could not help smiling as he saw the great preparations that had been made for his capture
the leader of the troop looked up
jimmy gasped as he saw the face of their leader for it was that of the man who had attacked him in the slums of st vincent the next moment they were thundering at the door
what do you want asked jones leaning pistol in hand from the window
paul jones was the reply of the rascal from st vincent
well here he is and here is what he has to say to you replied the young american as he discharged his pistol at the fellows head
the bullet sped true and the man threw up his hands and tumbled from his horse with a groan
this was the signal for a perfect fusillade of bullets on the part of the british but it did riot do them much good for jones had withdrawn from the window as soon as he fired
those fellows have exhausted all their weapons he exclaimed now is our time to fire while they are reloading the defenders of the inn poured in a volley and had the satisfaction of winging several of the men outside
this seemed to cool the ardor of the besiegers and they withdrew
they held a brief consultation and then one of them went to the bam and returned with several armfuls of bay which they piled against the door
what could they be going to do they were not left long in doubt
their next move was to produce a flint and steel
like a flash their fiendish intention broke on jones
they meant to burn the place
they were too close in to the wall for the besieged men to be able to shoot at them
and yet to let them fire the inn meant death
we must make a dash for it exclaimed jones
led by the gallant young american they dashed down the stairs to the door
jones flung it open and the next moment they were in the midst of their enemies
the british were taken completely by surprise
jones sword had never done better work
in a few minutes the englishmen were put to flight and cato and scipio crawled out of the garret where they had been hidden
the landlord was the only one injured
jones saw at once that his wound was mortal
the dying man gasped out to the american that he wanted to say something to him ere he breathed his last jones leaned over him to catch his words
forgive me he gasped and ere jones could reply fell back with a gaspdead
there is little more to tell louis conferred upon jones when he heard of his achievements off st vincent the muchcoveted cross of the legion of honor and mr franklin was able to promise him more ships for his little navy in whose upbuilding he found his life work
of his return to america and the honors that awaited him there this is not the place to tell
that he was a nations hero though our readers will not doubt
he did not remain long on shore however but soon engaged in another hazardous undertaking
what this was and with what wonderful nerve and dash he accomplished it will be told in the next issue of this weekly no entitled paul jones bold swoop or cutting out a british supply ship
