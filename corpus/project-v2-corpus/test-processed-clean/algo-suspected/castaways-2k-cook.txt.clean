Castaways of the Year William Wallace Gook The time-coupe which brought back to the year six of the twenty-one who had gone in it to the year having been destroyed by a bolt of lightning, fifteen of the number are marooned a century ahead of their own times. Meanwhile Dr. Kelpie, inventor of the coupe, has mysteriously disappeared, and Gig Lindley is arrested on the charge of having abducted him. The members of the Relief and Rescue Society for the Castaways of the Year go to Dr. residence on an urgent summons from his man Chester. Here they find the Man from who with the time-ball, an invention of the twenty-first century, says he has come back to transport the members of the society to their friends in the year Jasper Kinch, detective, insists on Tod brother Jefferson accompanying them, and the five of them cover a century in ten minutes to find themselves sprawled on the floor, and the Man from vanished. Then a door opens and none other than the missing Dr. Kelpie appears, “lama prisoner of the era he tells them. You are all prisoners. There is treachery afoot and little hope for any of us.” It appears that the fifteen prisoners of the twenty-first century have taken possession of the government and are running things in their own way. In seeking to escape, Everson Lumley, author of The Possibilities of the Sub-Conscious Ego, becomes separated from the others and is rescued by Kennedy, who, in company with Horton, are discoursing with him about the edict of the usurpers that vaporized foods shall be replaced by the old-fashioned masticated sort. Suddenly there is the thump of an air-ship alighting on the roof. At sight of one of the two arrivals, heart fails him as a wave of remembrance rolls over his brain like an icy flood. Why, oh, why had he not fallen before the electric guns of the guards? Lumley asked himself. Why had he been spared to be brought face" to face with the daughter of Kennedy, dismay at that moment was somewhat tempered by surprise. Following Miss Tibijul into the room was none other than Jefferson Plunkett! Lumley had become acquainted with Miss Tibijul on the occasion of his first visit to the year The business of courtship in those times had been almost entirely taken over by the fair sex, and Lumley was wooed by Miss Tibijul with a dogged persistency that well-nigh drove him distracted. Up to the last exciting moment of his previous sojourn in Lumley had been harassed by the unwelcome Began October Argosy. Back numbers for sale at this office. attentions of Miss Tibijul. Strange that he should have forgotten her, even at the time when he had found himself under her father’s roof. Somehow, as Lumley looked at Jefferson Plunkett and made note of the kindly consideration with which the lady favored him, his fears began to wane. Plunkett seemed entirely disorganized. There was a blank look in his face and an uncertain light in his eyes. Miss Tibijul took his hand and led him to a couch. Poor man,” she murmured commiseratingly, you’re all unstrung, and no wonder. Do sit down and rest. You are perfectly safe here.” Plunkett turned upon her a vacant stare. He did not speak, but slowly lifted a hand and drew it across his forehead. Gently Miss Tibijul pushed him down on the soft cushions behind him. He submitted passively. Daughter,” cried Kennedy, in consternation, what does this mean? We are already courting destruction by harboring one of the escaped hostages, and now, unless my eyes deceive me, you bring in another.” I saved him,” answered Miss Tibijul proudly and a bit defiantly. I was out for an afternoon fly in the Beetle, and I saw this poor gentleman below, a number of guards with electric guns pursuing him closely. I dropped down and took him aboard.” And the guards got the number of your air-ship, I presume? chided her father. A pretty situation, I must say, Hortense! The dictators will be after us, and so will our own people. But there’s no use arguing with a woman. Who is Ahis man? Jefferson Plunkett, father. You are mistaken about our danger being increased by what I have done. This gentleman is the brother of the chief dictator. In rescuing him this afternoon I have won for all of us here the gratitude of our worst enemy. We—” The lady’s words faded from her lips. She had been taking a survey of the room, and her eyes began to snap and sparkle behind the boxlike spectacles that covered them. “Well, dear me!” she exclaimed, stepping forward with outstretched hand. Here is my old friend, Everson Lumley, back again from the other century. The times have changed for the worse, Mr. Lumley, since you honored us with your first visit.” It was merely a friendly pressure which Miss Tibijul gave hand. He experienced a tremendous relief. After all, the lady had had only a passing fancy for him, and it was plain that the fancy had gone, never to return. heart expanded with hope. am glad to see you again. Miss Tibijul,” he said, and—” Miss Hortense Kennedy, the lady interrupted. Edict No. by the dictator of customs changed every name in New York.” I wish to thank you, Kennedy,” Lumley proceeded, for saving Mr. Jefferson Plunkett. We were all quite worried about him.” As soon as I took him aboard the Beetle he asked me to hurry to Street Station. What did he mean He is an incredulous person,” explained Lumley, and refuses to believe that he has been transported from oi to the following century.” I knew something was wrong with him,” declared Miss Kennedy. He needs the gentlest treatment, or the shock of full realization will unbalance his mind.” She went over and sat down on the couch beside Plunkett. you understand, Jefferson,” she cooed, that nearly a hundred years have passed since yesterday? Plunkett lifted his hands and felt wonderingly of the upthrust braids capped with the gaudy ribbons. Then suddenly he broke into a maundering laugh. What a funny dream! he exclaimed. As Miss Kennedy drew back, impelled by some unpleasant inference drawn from the words, Plunkett arose and let his eyes wander about the room. The shadows had begun to fall, and Horton, passed to a table and uncapped the tin of condensed light he had brought with him into the room. A sunny glow diffused itself about the place, and Plunkett rubbed his double chin thoughtfully. he mused, can you beat it? Chased by guards with electric guns, picked up by something out of a comic supplement, carried off in an air- ship, brought down through the roof-door of a house, and now some one illuminates by opening a tin can! Ouch! This is getting so deuced serious that it hurts. Wonder if going dippy? Wish I could get an expert medical opinion.” Lumley, prompted by a generous instinct to reassure a distressed mind, came forward. Mr. Plunkett,” he asked, don’t you remember me you—” A wild bellow came from Plunkett. Know you he cried thickly. you think for a minute, by James, that ever let you slip out of my mind. here and you’re alone; I guess that’s enough for me.” With that he bore down upon Lumley, his face black with anger and his fat fists clenched. Miss Kennedy screamed and wrung her hands. Horton threw a chair in front of Plunkett, over which he tripped and went crashing to the floor. Kennedy seized Lumley by the arm. Come with me, Lumley,” he whispered excitedly. The man will kill you if I don’t get you out of the way.” Lumley regretted the circumstances while yielding to the force of them. Giving himself into hands, he was conducted into a dark passage, and finally into a sleeping apartment. Here Kennedy pressed a button which opened electrically a can of light fixed in a wall-socket; and then he closed and secured the door. Greatly perturbed, he walked up and down the room, while Lumley dropped upon the bed and reclined there to await further developments. There is no peace, no happiness for any of us since those dictators have been promulgating their decrees,” said Kennedy finally, coming wearily to a halt and facing his guest. Nothing goes as it should; even the ordinary course of events continually develops one thing after another to keep a New Yorker of the period in a nervous condition. Everything is being changed, and changed for the worse.” Lumley had a soft heart, and. felt keenly for his friend. There was little that he could say, however, and so he held his peace. When you were here before, Lumley,” pursued Kennedy, muglugs did all the work for us. We had house muglugs, factory muglugs, air ship muglugs, and so on, so that it was necessary for us simply to speak and our orders were obeyed by tireless automatons of steel. Now these drudges have been taken away from us, and we are obliged to work with our own hands. even and his voice filled with bitterness, have my back yard filled with pig iron, and am compelled to manufacture rain plugs for the weather department. This manual labor is sapping the life out of me. is a change very soon I shall pine away under my misfortunes. This latest edict from the food department caps a climax. I cannot offer you supper, Lumley, for there is not a particle of vaporized food in the house; and I would not give you any if there were. morning I shall try and have a breakfast according to the anchient culinary standards, but I canmot promise you anything even passable. My chef, Brown, has one of these cook-books the dictators have forced on us, and the mere reading of half a dozen recipes sent him into a swoon. So I have my doubts about that morning meal. Now, friend Lumley, there are a great many things I must talk with you about—and not the least Of these pressing topics is this man Jefferson Plunkett and his hostile attitude toward you—but I am in no condition this evening to discuss matters of importance. if you please, we will consider your case in all its bearings. Meantime, let me urge you to get a good night’s rest. You are obliged to go supperless to bed, but the dictators are responsible for that.” He moved toward the door. Horton and I will take care of Plunkett,” he went on, but it will be just as well for you to lock the door after me.” Pm obliged to you, Mr. Kennedy,” said Lumley, for your kindness to me. Before I try to rest, though, like to pick up a few transmits about my scattered friends. badly worried, and—” The information regarding your friends is incomplete and unsatisfactory,” interrupted Kennedy. Probably it will be to-morrow morning before we can secure anything definite. Have courage and patience, Lumley. Those on our side won’t dare do anything desperate, and of course your friends have nothing to fear from the dictators. Good night, my friend.” Kennedy passed from the room, and Lumley locked the door behind him and went to bed. On his previous visit to those luxurious times every household had muglugs for menials. Each guest had a dapper little muglug valet to serve him, and throughout the establishment there were steel servants to fetch and carry. Lumley was having the striking changes in the year brought home to him in a most telling manner, -and his mind dwelt upon the subject for an hour or two before he went to sleep. At last he dropped over the edge of consciousness and began swimming through a sea of dreams. Now he was confronting electric guns that belched their thunderbolts in his face, and now he was frantically pursuing the timeball and the chain of a hundred links through frightful centuries. Again, he was tormented by the amazonian attentions of Miss Tibijul, otherwise Hortense Kennedy, or was strapped in the iron chair of the thinkograph, or was battling to the death with Jefferson Plunkett. The fight with Plunkett came along at the end of his dreaming. He had struck at the fat hardware salesman and missed; with a. taunting laugh, the salesman had let drive at him with conspicuous success. The blow landed with a crash, and ears were still ringing as he opened his eyes. He discovered that he was sitting up in bed with fists doubled. It was broad daylight, and he drew a long breath of relief as he realized that he had been the victim of a nightmare. Then, the next moment, he realized, too, that some one was pounding on his door. Lumley! Wake up, Lumley! It was the voice of Kennedy, and was fairly crackling with excitement. wanted?” inquired Lumley. Let me in—hurry! in danger, Lumley! Lumley rolled out of bed and made haste to open the door. Kennedy, very much out of breath, staggered across the threshold. His face was ominous, and heart sank. What has gone wrong, Kennedy he gasped. Jefferson Plunkett has been using the transmit,” panted Kennedy. Horton showed him how to use the thoughtwaves, and Plunkett sent out word, broadcast over the city, that you were being harbored in my house. The man must be crazy! Get into your clothes, Lumley, as quickly as possible.” This last admonition was useless, for Lumley was already pawing wildly at his garments. Kennedy helped him. What am I to do? faltered Lumley. I haven’t been able to think of anything, as yet,” was the response. hoping that some of the muglug army will get here before the guards, and that—” Kennedy paused. A thump on the roof announced the alighting of an airship. A moment more and the voice of Horton came piercingly from a distance The guards are here, Kennedy! The house is surrounded and a detachment has just landed on the roofstaging and captured Plunkett!” Just then Horton showed his wild face in the door. Better surrender, Lumley,” he advised there’s really nothing else to be done.” not surrender hints! flung back Kennedy. Come on, Lumley; don't stop to put on your shoes.” With a shoe in each hand Lumley bolted after his host. Out in the hall they could hear the scuffling footsteps of the guards, racing through the rooms in a furious search. This way,” whispered Kennedy, and made off along the passage. An exultant cry came from somewhere in the rear. They see you! exclaimed Horton. You are mad, Kennedy, to try to—” The words were lost. Kennedy had rushed through a door, jerked Lumley after him, and then slammed the door and shot a bolt. “An idea!” murmured Kennedy. I can save you, Lumley, but we shall have to be quick.” “Save me?” echoed Lumley, in a panic. “How?” This is the pneumatic tube-room. From this point we send and receive packages from all over the city. Here!” He stepped to one side of the chamber. In the wall, some two feet from the floor, was a round opening closed with a metal disk. Above the disk was a transmit-knob. Just below the disk was a trestlework topped with a bed of small rollers. Upon the rollers lay a cylinder, six feet long by eighteen inches in diameter. The cylinder was pointed at each end and halved and hinged lengthwise so that the upper half opened like a lid. The long lid was thrown back and Lumley could see that the cylinder was empty. Get into it! instructed Kennedy sharply. it repeated Lumley, recoiling. Yes! your only chance. Be quick! Lumley climbed to the staging and squeezed himself into the cylinder. There was plenty of room up and down but a tight fit across. Kennedy, meanwhile, was striking the transmit-knob. Well came a voice. A hundred and thirty pounds of rain-plugs for the weather bureau,” called Kennedy. Rush order.” The way is clear. Load the rairvplugs into'the tube.” Kennedy pulled a lever. The circular disk vanished and revealed the maw of a black opening. With a smothered exclamation Lumley sat up in the steel shell. What are you going to do with me, Kennedy? he asked, tremulously. Send you to your friends by pneumatic tube,” was the answer. But rather not go to my friends in that way. I A rain of blows dashed against the closed door and a clamor of voices demanded the surrender of Lumley. With a hollow groan Lumley fell backward and w-edged himself into the cylinder. Swiftly Kennedy closed the cover and clamped it down. An awful feeling of helplessness and peril took possession of Everson Lumley. What if the cylinder should get blocked in the tube? How long would the air inside the steel shell support life? Suppose he gave over his direful suppositions abruptly. The rollers were turning beneath the cylinder and he felt that he was moving forward into the hole in the wall. A roar of air in violent suction filled his ears. A second later his head was driven into the rear point of the cylinder as he started suddenly and rushed at the weather bureau like a bullet from a gun. miles jernyngham, weather Lumley was too dazed to note when or how the cylinder came to a pause. He was conscious of some one working at the upper half of the shell and was presently blinking in a bright light as the lid was thrown back. He heard a yell of consternation and a patter of running feet; then an excited voice “Mr. Jernyngham! Mr. Jernyngham! “Hush that clamor, Simpson, came a second voice, and one of authority. the row, anyway? Come here, please, Mr. Jernyngham! There are no rain-plugs in that cylinder from Kennedy, Lumley heard a rumble of anger from Jernyngham and a movement in his direction. He sat up. Jernyngham and Simpson, were close. Jernyngham recoiled and Simpson gave another yell and pressed fearfully back against the wall. Suffering cyclones! exclaimed Jernyngham, recovering himself. Everson Lumley, or a Hottentot! Good morning, Miles,” said Lumley, cheerfully. just-had a narrow escape. You see, the guards were after me and Kennedy had to load me into the cylinder and fire me through the tube. How are you? Miles Jernyngham embraced his unexpected guest with great ardor. remember Kennedy for that! he declared. Confound that bloomer brigade, anyhow! no rime or reason in the way they’re acting. But they’ll get enough of it before we’re done with them. Tickled to death to see you, old man! Come into the office and tell me all about it.” Lumley fished his shoes out of the cylinder and turned to follow the weather dictator out of the tube-room. Get a grip on yourself, Simpson,” laughed Jernyngham as he passed his assistant. I don't wonder that you were taken aback when you looked for rain-plugs and found my old friend, Everson Lumley. hot in Syracuse and they want a few clouds. As soon as they shoot in a hundred dollars, push a couple of cloud-plugs into the Syracuse section.” Very well, sir,” answered Simpson, slowly recovering his mental poise. The way from the tube-room to the office carried Lumley and the dictator through a large chamber in which three meek-looking men of the period were at work. A large map of the State of New York had been split into three sections and fastened to three blank walls. Every town, village, and crossroads was plainly marked, and the entire surface was gouged with holes. Some of these holes were empty. Others were filled with round-headed plugs of different colors. On his way through the room Jernyngham paused and cast a critical eye over one of the sections. I guess you’d better pull out that Steuben County plug, Arnold, said he. already given them more rain than they’ve paid for. And I want you to be more careful with the gale-plugs, Arnold. Herkimer County didn’t whack-up for that last spell of fair weather, and I told you to switch in one gale-plug and you switched in two. I just heard that you unroofed three stores in Coldbrook and blew over a steeple in Fairfield. Be a little more careful or you’ll get your walking-papers.” Jernyngham passed on into the office and closed the door after Lumley. a great graft, Lumley, this weather business, grinned Jernyngham, in high good humor, as he motioned his guest to a chair. said Lumley, sitting down and beginning to get into his shoes, is it right, Miles, to make a graft of it? “Why not? Before we took hold the weather business was in the hands of a trust. driven out the trusts/ cornered the muglugs and set the people to work. We charge only half what the trust charged for weather, and everybody ought to be satisfied.” Glad to hear you have cut the prices, but driving out one trust and replacing it with another isn’t just the thing, is it? And in the case of a public necessity, like the weather, shouldn’t the government have control what it has,” grinned Jernyngham; we’re the government in the State of New York. But we won’t discuss this at present. hungry and was just going to have breakfast. Join me, and we’ll talk as we eat. Simpson, he shouted. Simpson appeared in the door of the chart-room. Double that breakfast order,” said Jernyngham. Two portions ham and eggs. By the way, Lumley, how do you like your eggs? Turned over,” answered Lumley, brightening with pleasant anticipations. Remember that, Simpson, went on Jernyngham. Double up on the fried potatoes, the buttered toast and the coffee. Also lay covers for two, for I have,” and here he gave a droll wink, a hundred and thirty pounds of rain-plugs to breakfast with me.” Simpson smiled faintly and withdrew. Jernyngham lifted his feet to the top of his desk and tilted back comfortably in his office-chair. “We kept track of you fairly well yesterday by means of the transmits,” said he, up to the time you vanished in back yard. What happened to you after that Lumley recounted his experiences. As he talked he watched Simpson setting a table with white linen, blue china and shining spoons and cutlery. These preparations, in view of the fact that he had had a vaporized dinner the day before, and no supper, cheered him tremendously. Throughout the recital Jernyngham gave Lumley his absorbed attention. Whew! exclaimed the weather dictator, when the story was done, you fellows did have a time of it, and no mistake. Smith, was a pestiferous person, and I am glad he has been put out of the way. But your situation, Lumley, was not so perilous as it appeared. Those guards would never have dared to annihilate you with their electric guns. They knew too well that the vengeance of the dictators would be swift and sure.” “If you men have the whole city under your control,” asked Lumley, how is it possible for any of the citizens of the period to defy your authority? That was because they had Dr. Kelpie,” explained Jernyngham. “They used the doctor as a club, threatening him with death if we did not give up the important posts we occupy. Finding their threats would not intimidate us. Smith, used the doctor’s time-machine to go back into the past after more of you fellows. The situation was becoming pretty Jerry Dicks evolved that plot to help you escape. We know, now, why you anticipated activities. Of course, we’re not out of the woods yet, by a long shot, but we’re going to hang on to our powers and prerogatives. great, Lumley, for a bunch of year men to boss this year If you had a hand in the game you’d know how we feel.” have to leave these times, Miles,” said Lumley. We came to rescue you and you’ve got to go back with us.” Jernyngham shook his head. you believe it! doing a splendid work here, and Tod Plunkett is planning to extend our power over the whole country. never leave, Lumley.” But what will happen to Gig Lindley cried Lumley. I guess he will have to be sacrificed. The greatest good for the greatest number is our slogan.” The horror Lumley felt was too deep for words. But it was not a time to argue the point, for he was hungry, and a hungry man’s mind is not at its best. Where are the rest of our friends who escaped with me he inquired. and Lindley were picked up by an air-ship belonging to the department of customs; Kinch and Mortimer were rescued by a detachment of muglugs under command of Jerry Dicks. Now that you and Jefferson Plunkett are accounted for, the only man missing is Dr. Kelpie. I presume that he and Plunkett are in the hands of the guards.” At. this moment Simpson began bringing in a number of covered dishes and placing them on the table. The appetizing odor he brought with him was most delightful. His final act was to place half a dozen cigars in the center of the table and push up a couple of chairs. All ready, sir,” he announced. Come, Lumley,” said Jernyngham, and got up and started toward the table. Lumley was smiling and rubbing his hands. He was very certain that never in his whole life had he been so nearly famished as he was at that moment. They paused on their way to the table, startled by cries from the chartroom. Before Jernyngham could investigate the cause of the commotion, a short, fat man came puffing through the office door. His face was red and his little eyes glimmered. In one hand he held a small revolver, of the ancient pattern, and he fanned the point of it back and forth so that it covered impartially Jernyngham, Lumley, and Simpson. Stand where you are! he commanded in a stuffy, determined voice. Plunkett!” whispered Lumley, astounded. Yes,” answered the man with the weapon, a deadly menace in his tones, “Jeff Plunkett, on the road for Lockett Biggs, hardware. This is a sample gun that I happened to find in my pocket. There are five lives in the cylinder, by James! forget that. Sit" down! But I say, Plunkett,” began Jernyngham, we were about to—” Sit down! exploded Plunkett, wrathfully. Simpson did not wait to find a chair, but wilted to the floor. Jernyngham and Lumley backed warily to the seats they had just vacated and dropped into them again. Still watching the three, Plunkett moved to the table, took a chair facing them and rested the elbow of his gunhand on the white linen. Now, listen,” he went on. going to have a square meal, and you are going to stay right where you are and watch me eat it. If one of you makes a move, or speaks a word before I light a cigar, there’ll be fireworks. I don't know a thing about electric guns and thunderbolts, but Buffalo Bill himself hasn’t anything on me when it comes to juggling a revolver.” Cautiously Jefferson Plunkett laid the weapon beside his plate and proceeded to relieve the very large famine that had afflicted him for twenty-four hours. Lumley watched him wistfully, even if a little fearfully, while Jernyngham looked on with humorous resignation. startling Jefferson Plunkett made a clean sweep of everything on the table. Double portions of ham and eggs, fried potatoes, and toast vanished from before him like magic. As the food disappeared his complacency grew. When the plates were empty he selected a cigar, sniffed at it with the fastidiousness of a connoisseur, smiled gratefully and lighted it; then, very coolly, he appropriated the rest of the cigars and stowed them away in his pockets. Take it from me, gentlemen,” said he, that I have just experienced the pleasantest part of this little dream. My mind is beginning to smooth itself out and have a few lucid intervals. a cinch that this situation is too many for me, and it’s another cinch .that I was shanghaied and pushed idto it against my will. From now on I shall demand what I need and enforce my demands with this sample of Locket goods.” He picked up the revolver, patted it affectionately and dropped it into his coat-pocket. You may now,” he added, indulge in any conversation that seems appropriate.” Simpson, had slipped from the room while Plunkett was lighting his cigar. He now, very warily, thrust his head in at the door. Dust is flying in Buffalo, Mr. Jernyngham,” he announced, and they are asking for a hundred-dollar sprinkle. Also a request comes from the Mohawk Valley for a thousand dollars’ worth of soaking rain.” Very good,” nodded Jernyngham. As soon as you hear from the treasury that Buffalo and Mohawk Valley have remitted, see that the sprinkleplug is switched in for a twenty-minute precipitation at Buffalo, and that Mohawk Valley is lined with rain-plugs for a two-hours’ downpour.” Yes, sir.” Simpson disappeared. Plunkett grabbed the edge of the table, stared at Jernyngham, and his lower jaw fell. His cigar dropped into a plate. After a moment he mumbled to himself, picked up the cigar absently and resumed his smoking. Just as beginning to feel tolerably comfortable,” said he, something like this has to happen.” Mr. Plunkett,” spoke up Lumley, this gentleman is Miles Jernyngham, of the weather bureau.” Plunkett acknowledged the introduction with a scowl and a nod. Jernyngham lifted his voice and called for Simpson. Duplicate that breakfast order, Simp,” said he, and see how quick you can do it.” He turned, to Plunkett. Lumley and he went on, had just made up our minds that you had been recaptured, so your appearance here was in the nature of a pleasant surprise. How did you get away from the guards Miss Kennedy attended to that,” answered Plunkett. She dropped me through a grating in the dining-room and then led me up to the roof in a roundabout way. There we boarded the family flier. Miss Kennedy let me off on top of the weather bureau and told me to go down and look for friends.” A derisive smile dug creases in the drummer’s face. And I don’t think,” he finished, that I gave you a pleasant surprise when I showed up here; it was a surprise, all right, but the pleasure was mostly mine.” got to hand you a piece of my mind, Mr. Plunkett,” observed Jernyngham, and I might as well do it right now. I hope you’ll take it kindly, but you’ve got to take it, whether kindly or no. Your conduct toward those who came with you to these times has been most reprehensible. You seem, Plunkett, to be constantly on the lookout for opportunities to betray your companions into the hands of their enemies. Now, we’re a little band of castaways who, by our native shrewdness and ability, have succeeded in getting a strangle hold on our environment. got to hang together, understand? Eternal vigilance is the price of our success. Your brother, Tod, is the boss dictator, and on his account, if for no other reason, you ought to be with us rather than against us.” If Plunkett was impressed with these blunt remarks he failed to show it. He listened to Jemyngham with a derisive smile. jerry to this, all right,” said he, that everything seems and that nothing really is. been doped, and when I come to you can bet your bottom sou marquee that going to make things hot for the bunch that worked the hocus pocus. When I wake up I want to have the satisfaction of knowing that I plugged for my side even while I was under the influence of that funny powder. Just at present little Alice Plunkett in Wonderland, and very, very busy hunting a way back to Junction, where I got off. Meanwhile, going to be as obstreperous as I can.” Simpson came in, and began clearing away the table. Lumley watched him with interest and impatience. In fact, he was so wrapped up in the prospect of that delayed breakfast that he could not feel properly aggrieved at the stand taken l?y Jefferson Plunkett. Jernyngham had it in mind to be very severe—there was no doubt at all about that—but before he could vent his indignation upon Plunkett something else happened. A door opened and closed. Footsteps were heard approaching hurriedly. There was another flurry of excitement in the chartroom; and Kinch flung himself ihto the office. “Ah, Lumley!” Kinch exclaimed. Glad to see you, Jernyngham. Excuse brevity, but in the biggest kind of a rush. Got an air-ship on the roof, and just dropped in for a moment to have a word with Lumley. trying to corral all of our crowd at the office of the chief dictator. Mortimer, Ripley, and are there, and Lumley is to join them at once. off to get Dr. Kelpie.” How did you know I was here inquired Lumley. The news came by transmit from Kennedy, Have you found Dr. Kelpie heard from him. The information was brought by one of the guards, who was bribed by the doctor. Kelpie was recaptured, but while he was free he managed to hide the timeball now he’s back in the old quarters in Amsterdam Avenue, with the guards doubled, and they’re going to use the thinkograph on him and discover where he secreted the main part of the time-machine. got to prevent that. Dicks is marching a strong force of muglugs at the double-quick to the Kelpie house, and needed there to direct proceedings. A sound of quick movement drew all eyes toward the office door. Jefferson Plunkett was just making a hasty exit. Come back here! shouted Kinch. Be hanged to you! flung back Plunkett, looking around and flourishing his revolver. Try to stop me and shoot. not get the want it myself.” He slammed the door, leaving those in the office staring at each other in apprehension and dismay. Confound the fellow! grunted Jernyngham. Not that this timeball counts for much, so far as the dictators are concerned, but—” It counts for more than you know! cried the exasperated detective. I wish brought that electric gun. As it happens, I haven’t a weapon of any sort; but not let that stand in the way.” With that he flung open the door of the chart-room. The operators were huddled in one corner, like a lot of frightened sheep. Through the open door of the tube-room Jefferson Plunkett could be seen puffing and floundering on the flight of iron stairs that led to the roof. Followed by Lumley and Jernyngham, Kinch plunged on in fierce pursuit. By the time the three reached the foot of the stairs Plunkett was out of the roof-door, and by the time the pursuers reached the roof the machine that had brought the detective was on the wing, Plunkett balanced amidships and covering the pilot with his revolver. As he slipped swiftly away into space the hardware drummer gave vent to a wheezy, taunting laugh. If he gets that time-ball,” cried the panic-stricken Lumley, he’ll destroy it. He doesn’t know, he doesn’t understand—” got to overhaul him! exclaimed Kinch. another flying-machine? I say, there, Jernyngham! got to have another machine.” Jernyngham was hauling a red flag to the top of a short staff. signaling for a municipal flier,” said he. Ah, ha! there’s one now, heading this way.” The municipal machine, which paid a license to the air ship department and was for hire, rounded gracefully to a pause above the roof and then settled down into the stays. Kinch and Lumley ran up the steps and clambered aboard. “Follow that craft!” shouted Kinch, pointing south toward the other airship. The pilot started his helicopters; and then, when they were swinging well over the roof; turned on the propellers. double-cross this little game of declared the detective, with grim determination. By what process of reasoning has he convinced himself that he can get that time-ball, anyhow Why, he’s plain crazy, there is no doubt of that.” plain troublesome, Jasper,” returned Lumley, and he seems to have a way of doing the wrong thing with a good deal of success. Plunkett, the avenger,’ is surely an appropriate name for him. I have awful forebodings that he is on the point of doing something rash something that will result in a tremendous catastrophe.” “You forget,” frowned Kinch, “that Plunkett is matching wits with me.” Thereupon he broke off the conversation, gave attention to the chase, and urged the driver to crowd on more power. Two things were evident to those in the municipal flier. One was that the driver was doing everything possible to get the best speed out of the machine, and the other was that they were barely holding their own in the chase. overloaded,” said the driver. a man of the period,” cried Kinch fiercely, and on peril of your life tell me the truth: Are you for or against the dictators? Is there any reason for you to keep this air-ship back The driver shivered under the deadly menace of the detective’s voice and look. no quarrel with the dictators,” he whimpered. If I had, why should I hold this machine back? The man we’re chasing is one of your crowd. I tell you, sir, we’re overloaded.” Kinch appeared convinced of the driver’s sincerity. Never slow in making up his mind, he had planned the next step before the pilot had done speaking. Hover over that roof, ahead there,” he ordered, pointing. Stop, but don’t land. Come to a standstill two or three feet above the landingstage.” Very well, sir.” Sorry, Lumley,” said Kinch, but the craft is overloaded, and you’ll have to drop out on that roof and wait until I finish the chase and come back and pick you up. But be sure and wait. All of our crowd must be got together, and kept together. bag Plunkett, and we’ll halt his troublesome career by keeping him bound and under lock and key. By lightening ship we shall be able to overhaul the craft ahead.” Lumley was disappointed, but he had the utmost confidence in Kinch, and promptly fell in with his plans. The helicopters were holding the municipal machine a few feet above the landing-stage of the strange roof-top. Lumley climbed over the side, lowered himself to arms’ length, and dropped. He landed lightly, easily, and then watched while the air-ship resumed the chase. I hope nothing goes wrong,” he said to himself, turning to the edge of the platform and descending a short flight of steps to the roof. “If the time-ball falls into the hands of our enemies, there’s no telling where our troubles will end.” His worries on the score of Dr. Kelpie and the time-ball had caused him to forget for the time being that he had been deprived of the morning meal, of which he stood very much in need. Now that he had been eliminated from the chase and its attendant excitement, his mind returned wistfully to the subject of his lost breakfast. A sort of pergola, hard by the landing stage and offering a shelter of flowering vines, invited him. He entered its cooling shadow and sat down on a cushioned bench. By a supreme effort of the will he sought to banish visions of ham and eggs, fried potatoes, toast, and coffee. As a means to the end, he steered his thoughts in other channels. It was clear that the members of the Rescue Society were going to have a hard time prying the dictators loose from their powers and prerogatives and carrying them back into the past. Yet it must be done in some way. They had no moral right to tyrannize over the folks of the twenty-first century. People of different ages are differently constituted. How would the people of the year have felt if some usurpers had come on from the year banished the telegraph for the post rider and retired incandescent bulbs in favor of tallow-dips? No, no! Surely a man has no right to any other era than that in which he is born. The castaways, perhaps not maliciously, were perpetrating a great wrong; and Lumley was grieved to note that a sordid spirit had entered into their operations, and that they were manipulating the weather, the culinary operations, and no doubt everything else, for their own financial benefit. This reflections were cut short. What was that he heard? A groan? He started to his feet and listened intently. Yes, there was no mistake. Here was something that demanded investigation. Midway of the pergola’s length was the built-up hood that sheltered the roof-door. Lumley observed that the door was ajar, and he was not long in determining that the gruesome sounds he had heard were wafted through the opening. Cautiously he advanced to the door, pushed it wide, and stepped through. Descending the broad stairway a short distance, he looked over the balustrade, and an odd scene revealed itself to him. The room into which he had partly descended was the triclinium, or dining-room, of the household. It was a very rich apartment, with walls frescoed by the hands of some master artist, and with chairs and couches upholstered in the costliest fabrics. The grating, through which the food vapors were wont to ascend, was of yellow gold wrought out in an intricate and graceful design. On one side of this grating stood a table—a breakfast-table, as it werebrought from some peasant’s hut and put down in those luxurious surroundings. It was covered with a paper cloth, and the dishes were of tin, evidently designed for other uses and pressed into service by sudden necessity. There was a bowl-shaped dish half full of a dark liquid. At half a dozen places around the board were plates heaped with food a sort of food Lumley could not remember ever having seen before. Six chairs were pushed back from the table. Those who had been eating were lying on couches, or were writhing in chairs, filled with a misery that found vent in heart-wrenching groans. Lumley grasped the situation in a moment. This was the result of decree These people of the period were trying to carry out the terms of the new law. For years they had sat at their golden grating, conversing pleasantly and absorbing their nutrition. Now they were trying to eat the solid, non-vaporized, non-deodorized food, and the result could not be otherwise than painful. heart went out to the sufferers, even as his indignation waxed strong against the dictators. It was a brutal decree. Famished as he was, however, the sight of that breakfast tempted him. Not one of the six members of the household paid him the slightest attention, and he descended quietly, drew up one of the chairs, and sat down at the table. He picked up a fragment of something, tried to determine what it was by sight, and then by taste. It was hard and soggy and burned. He dropped it. Yes, he was hungrier than he had ever been in his life, but he couldn’t go that. Eat it,” commanded a hollow voice. It is called bread in the cookbook. You are from those distant times, and we ask a demonstration. Prove to us that the stuff is edible.” Lumley looked up. The man of the house evidently was standing before him. His absurd costume in nowise diminished the touching spectacle he presented. The pinched face and feverish eyes were mute evidences of starvation. My dear friend,” returned Lumley with feeling, I would put up with a good deal of personal inconvenience to eat this bread, if it were possible. But it isn’t. Your cook has made a botch of the baking.” Try one of those chops,” begged the man; there, beside the bread.” Chops echoed Lumley. These are not chops; they’re clinkers burned to a cinder. No one could eat those things.” Have some of the coffee.’ Lumley tried it, and strangled. I can’t,” he sputtered. like to oblige you if I could; but there’s a limit to what I can stand, even when ravenous.” So! came from the other bitterly. “We are ordered by these usurpers to eat food that even they cannot endure, and they’ve always been eaters, while we have become absorbers. Our natures are delicately attuned to the beautiful and the progressive in life, and the coarseness of the act of mastication revolts us, even as the odors of the solid food is offensive. Mark my words: Decree will prove the undoing of these usurpers.” “Where did he come from?” queried another voice. Lumley looked around. All the male members of the household four of them—were on their feet. The mother and daughter had lifted themselves on their couches and were staring at Lumley with reproachful eyes. Lumley explained that he had been set down on the roof by a friend, and was to be picked up later. He was one of the recent arrivals. While on the roof he had heard groans, and out of a desire to relieve a fellow creature’s distress he had intruded into the triclinium. He hoped they would pardon him. He felt for them deeply, and was sorry he was powerless to be of any help. If th'y would excuse him, he would go back to the roof again and wait for his friend’s air-ship. One of the sons sprang to the wall and pulled a switch. The roof-door could be heard to close. I opened that door,” said the young man, so that we could get the air. Now it is closed and fastened.” Well done! exclaimed the head of the house. Send a transmit to the headquarters of the opposition one of you. We will turn this man over to them.” Then, and for the first time, Lumley realized that his generous desire to aid the distressed had plunged him into trouble. To get to the roof was impossible. The elevator opening was in the wall behind him, and he started up and retreated toward it. All the time he was executing his retreat toward the elevator he was pleading with his enraged foes for their kindly consideration. One of the sons was taking down an electric rifle from the wall. Mother and daughter, clasped in each other’s arms, were on the verge of hysteria. But the father, tortured into fury by decree was eager for hostilities. Just as the young man turned with the electric rifle, Lumley fell backward into the elevator cage. His falling body touched the spring that released the car, and he shot downward^ At the foot of the shaft he regained his feet and plunged through an open door. He was on the ground floor of the house, and above him he could hear sounds of wildest commotion—transmits shouted to the opposition, screams of women, wild shouts of the men, a patter of feet on broad staircases. Lumley gained a massive street door, only to find it locked. What was there to do? He fought with the door, and as he struggled he called wildly for help.. His calls, he frantically reasoned, were as useless as his attempts to open the door. Yet he must do something, and instinctively he continued to shout and wrench at the barrier with all his strength. Suddenly there was a crash, a ringing impact as of a ton of steel hurled against the door on its outer side. The stout wood shivered, and all but yielded. Again came the thunderous attack, and this time the door was burst inward. Lumley was flung backward to the floor. As he lay there he had a glimpse of a warrior muglug charging through the breach. The steel giant bent over Lumley, lifted him as easily as though he had been an infant, flung him across one shoulder, and made off with him. Outside the house another muglug of the warrior class joined the first, and shoulder to shoulder the two rattled and clanged their way down the street. The relief Lumley might otherwise have felt was clouded with uncertainty. He was held to the muglug’s shoulder by a viselike grip of the iron hands, and every attempt he made to free himself was met with firm resistance. The two muglugs were at large. Were they dependable, or had they rebelled against the authority of Jerry Dicks and gone on a bit of a rampage? Lumley could only wait and worry and hope for the best. Five minutes after Lumley had been rescued from the house where edict had caused so much distress he was borne into a great building that fairly roared with activity. On every hand steel was smiting steel, and the din was terrific. Muglugs were at work building other muglugs. The steel mechanics were divided into groups, and each group had its own particular piecework. Here were a dozen or so shaping, fitting, and riveting the metal heads; just beyond these were the torso-workers farther along were the toilers who hinged and jointed the wonderful arms and hands; over on the right were those whose business it was to fashion the legs and feet, and make perfect the clever joints at thigh, knee, and ankle; and then, last of all, were the assembling frames where each part was brought together, and the completed muglug stamped with a number and laid aside for test and final approval. Lumley, over the iron shoulder of the muglug who was carrying him, surveyed the establishment with wonder and admiration. He "had lost his fears, for the arrival at the factory had convinced him that, although the steel warriors were at large, they were by no means proceeding at random. Reassured as to his own personal safety, he surveyed the plant with interest as he was carried through it. Passing out of the huge workshop, the two muglugs crossed a glassy plot and entered a small building. Lumley was placed in a chair, and the metal giants who had brought him ranged themselves side by side along the wall and lifted their hands to their foreheads. A tow-headed usurper of perhaps twenty-five sat at a table in front of a number of blue-prints and received the salute. At the opposite end of the table was a hatchet-faced, thin-shanked man, who stared at Lumley as though at a ghost. Hello, Archibald Grant! exclaimed Lumley. Well, what do you think of this muttered Grant. Where the deuce did those muglugs pick you up, Lumley? With the words, Grant came over and took Lumley by the hand. They saved my life, I think,” said Lumley, and explained his recent perils and the timely advent of the two iron warriors. Good! exclaimed Grant, striking his hands together in gratified approval. Write it down, Haskins, he added, turning to his assistant at the desk; Nos. and tested and found Very well, sir,” answered Haskins, and made an entry in a book. Grant faced the two muglugs. Proceed at once to the barracks,” he ordered, and report to Captain Dicks.” Again the metal warriors saluted, then wheeled and tramped away. As soon as the muglugs are finished,” explained Grant, we send them out into the town to see how they behave themselves under the subconscious rays. If they prove tractable, and show the proper amount of initiative, they are passed; if, on the other hand, they are sullen, slow in their movements, and backward in obeying orders, they are repaired and tried again.” This is most remarkable! exclaimed Lumley. It should not be—to you. It was your book which made such a factory as this possible. We are hustling out the muglugs as fast as we can. You see, the new edict that retires vaporized and deodorized food is a good way from being popular. A storm is going to break before long, and we’ve got to have the city properly policed.” I should say the edict wasn’t popular It looks to me like a very unwise proceeding.” An elegant piece of graft, though,” chuckled Archibald Grant. already sold a million cookbooks, and the gold for them is in the treasury. A year of this, Lumley, and every one of the dictators will be a plutocrat.” Regret and sorrow stabbed Lumley to the heart. Graft, graft! Were these dictators thinking of nothing else? Could they heap miseries upon the people for no other purpose than that of lining their treasury? Lumley felt that he would soon have to take up the cudgels in defense of an oppressed people. For the present, however, there were other matters to claim his attention. Have you heard anything about Dr. Kelpie and the time-ball he asked; or about pursuit of Jefferson Plunkett?” A couple of transmits came in just before you got here,” answered Grant. Dicks stormed the old Kelpie house with a company of muglugs and rescued the doctor, and then the doctor recovered his precious time ball. Kinch, also, was successful. He overhauled Jefferson Plunkett and laid him by the heels; then he sailed back to pfck you off the roof where you had been left, and has been in a good deal of a funk ever since because he failed to find you. Haskins, Grant turned to his assistant—“ just go into the transmit-room, will you, and report that Lumley is here at the muglug factory? Haskins went into an adjoining chamber to send the transmit. All this good news left but one thing for Lumley to desire. Archibald,” said he, could you furnish me with a meal? I have had nothing to eat for more than twentyfour hours, and nearly famished.” Why, sure, Lumley! cried Grant. Haskins, and I have already had our dinner; but it won’t take us more than five minutes to get something through the tube for you. Haskins, send in a transmit for roast beef, hashed brown potatoes, bread, butter, apple pie, and coffee. Have the order rushed.” Haskins hurried away again. Pink Doolittle is the dictators’ chef, Lumley,” observed Grant. You remember Pink? He has a bloomer brigade to help him, and puts up a pretty fair line of eats. pulling down a good thing now, and has a cooking school for the old vaporizers and deodorizers—busy every minute at a hundred dollars a minute. that, eh? All our earnings go into a common fund, and when we get enough to retire we’re going to divide, share and share alike.” When you divide,” asked Lumley, where’ll you retire to A blank look crossed face. cross that bridge when we get to it,” he answered indefinitely. Will you go back to Hardly. The taste of unlimited power we have had has changed our whole outlook. These are pretty good times, Lumley, for men with a little snap and ginger. a pity your Rescue Society ever bothered with us. Everything was going swimmingly until Kelpie blew into this era, hitched to his time machine.. He was the hostage around which all the opposition rallied. If it hadn’t been for him, Lumley, we’d have had no opposition. Of course, when the rest of you fellows came along, the situation was still more complicated. getting everything pretty well in hand, though, and there are jobs for several more dictatorswe can place all of you late arrivals in good positions.” Lumley shuddered. He would have expressed himself in no uncertain terms had not his dinner arrived at that moment. Without loss of time he began appeasing his hunger. While he ate, another pair of newly completed muglugs were carried into the office by the steel-workers in steel from the factory. These were laid, ^grizzly mechanisms of inert metal, upon the floor. In the head of each was an oil-cup with a screw top. Haskins opened the cups and filled them from a pipe in the wall. Open the power-plugs, Haskins,” instructed Grant, and then send a transmit to Head Center for two more rays.” Haskins opened a little doof-in the back of each muglug’s head and tinkered for a moment with the powerplugs. After this he entered the transmit-room and sent in his call to Head Center. Sitting in his desk-chair, Archibald Grant bent two keenly critical eyes on the prostrate steel giants. One of them lifted its hand as the subconscious ray allotted to it by Head Center took hold,” and the other began to quiver uncannily. Get up,” ordered Grant. With a ringing jump each muglug gained its feet, imbued with power from the laboring human mind at Head Center. Have you made the record, Haskins?” inquired Grant. The assistant was writing in his book. No. and No. he replied. You two,” proceeded Grant, again addressing the muglugs, will proceed to the Hudson River and return by way of the Pleasure Gardens to this office. Be gone an hour—no longer. Go!” He waved his hand authoritatively. One of the muglugs whirled on its iron heel and started out. The other hesitated, an ominous, whirring sound issuing from its hollow interior. The sledge, Haskins! called Grant, rising. Haskins gripped an iron hammer that hung in a rack on the wall. At the same moment the defective steel giant rushed at Grant like a modern monster upon puny Frankenstein. Grant leaped clear, and Haskins struck a clanging blow on the muglug’s head with the hammer. A vital spot had been touched, and the power-plug disarranged. The steel warrior clumped down on the floor in a disorganized mass, and twitched and struggled feebly. Haskins bounded into the transmit-room, and could be heard signaling Head Center. Mug defective! Withdraw the ray.” Instantly No. stiffened out, and lay silent and still. It happens once in a while,” remarked Grant grimly. Call a couple of workers, Haskins, and send to the repair-shop.” As two toilers from the work-shop were carrying away the defective muglug, a glittering air-ship hovered suddenly over the grassy sward between the office and the factory, then dropped lightly and swiftly into the factory hangar. Through the open door of the office Lumley could see a determined-looking man step out of the craft and come down the hangar steps. On either side of him marched a warrior muglug, overlaid with gold and silver filigreework and armed with an electric rifle. “Now, what’s up?” remarked Grant, in a puzzled tone. the chief dictator, and he isn’t due to inspect the plant for a week yet. wrong, that’s a cinch.” Escorted by his glittering bodyguard, Tod Plunkett, the chief dictator, hastened across the strip of lawn and entered the office. How are you, Tod? cried Lumley, rising to greet the chief dictator. Lumley, old man,” returned Plunkett effusively, the sight of you is good for sore eyes. Welcome again to the year Things are vastly different now from what they were on your previous visit. The castaways have got a strangle-hold on the times, old chap, and we’re out for reform with a big a job waiting for you, and as soon as I got the transmit from the muglug factory giving news of your whereabouts, I climbed into the Meteor and flew over this way. Say, Lumley, you’ll never want to leave. want to cast in your lot with ours and become one of the dictators. All the others who came with you have accepted places of power, and we couldn’t think of leaving you out.” that?” asked Lumley, thinking he had not heard aright. Do you mean to say that Kinch, Mortimer, Ripley, and and Dr. Kelpie have become dictators? Exactly! laughed Tod Plunkett. Kinch is dictator of the secret service, and his fees and perquisites should amount to several millions a year. split up the department of foods, raiments, and beverages, and Mortimer goes in as dictator of raiments, while rules the beverage bureau. I left Mortimer preparing an edict which makes it a crime to wear bloomers of the period, and declares that on and after thirty days from date clothing of the year must be secured from the tailors of the raiment department. that for a rake-off? Ripley becomes dictator of dentistry and medicine, and already his department is rushed to death on account of edict His returns—” brain was dizzy. But what is Dr. Kelpie doing he interrupted hoarsely. He is dictator of microcosmology,” replied Plunkett. It is his business to watch the play of the various elements in our little world, and advise as to what must be done to keep in good health the goose that lays the golden egg. I hope you understand what I mean? and the chief dictator gave a shrewd wink. The room was whirling around Lumley, and he gripped the back of a chair to steady himself. He had been counting upon his fellow members of the Rescue Society for aid in persuading the castaways to leave careers of tyranny and graft and go back comfortably to Now these props had fallen away from him; they had even gone to support that nefarious structure of oppression and tribute so cunningly raised by the usurpers. Everson Lumley stood alone—alone against all this cruel greed which the twentieth century had unloaded upon the twenty-first. Ah, Dr. Kelpie, Dr. Kelpie, who could have believed it of you! But, stay! Lumley had one thought like a forlorn hope. Tod,” said he, what office have you given your brother Jefferson? I haven’t seen Jefferson as yet,” was the reply; but I shall certainly have a good dictatorship for Jeff. As for you, Lumley, what more fitting than that you should be supervisor general of the subconscious rays? You can have a blue and gold office in the Head Center Building, and make sure that the rays are at all times efficient and properly directed. no chance for graft; but what’s the odds All our pickings are thrown into a common fund, and when we’ve had enough of the game we’ll split even. What do you say Lumley had not the slightest intention of allying himself with the freebooters. He was consecrated to the one purpose of rescuing all of them from their reprehensible careers and restoring them to spheres of respectable activity in their own times. But if he gained his end against such overwhelming odds, he must proceed warily. have to think about it, Tod,” he said. I can’t give you an answer offhand.” Better come in with us, Lumley,” urged Archibald Grant. see about that later,” was evasive response. I think, Tod,” he went on to the chief dictator, “that decree was a mistake. It is causing a tremendous amount of distress, and the people will not put up with it. That decree, I should judge from my limited observation, is the last straw.” Tod Plunkett frowned. The people will have to put up with it! he declared. Our muglug army will force them to carry out the terms of the edict. 'The will of the dictators is the law of the land. Come along with me, Lumley. go back to headquarters.” The head dictator turned to Grant. Hustle the work here, Archibald,” said he. Every capable muglug you turn out is another rivet in the fabric of our power. The stronger we are, the farther we can go; and the farther we go, the more successful our information.” By working night and day, Tod,” replied Grant, we can turn out, on an average, twenty-five mugs, tested and every twenty-four hours. Only about one in ten is defective.” Good work! Keep it up. be around for regular weekly inspection on Saturday next. All ready, Lumley.” The two products de luxe of the muglug factory, especially constructed for the chief dictator’s body-guard, marched back to the gleaming air-ship as they had marched away from itflanking their august master.
