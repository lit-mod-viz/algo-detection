here kennedy press a button which open electrically a can of light fix in a wallsocket and then -PRON- close and secure the door

lumley be have the striking change in the year bring home to -PRON- in a most telling manner and -PRON- mind dwelt upon the subject for an hour or two before -PRON- go to sleep 
at last -PRON- drop over the edge of consciousness and begin swim through a sea of dream 
now -PRON- be confront electric gun that belch -PRON- thunderbolt in -PRON- face and now -PRON- be frantically pursue the timeball and the chain of a hundred link through frightful century

-PRON- see -PRON- exclaimed horton 
-PRON- be mad kennedy to try to the word be lose 
kennedy have rush through a door jerk lumley after -PRON- and then slam the door and shoot a bolt

just below the disk be a trestlework top with a bed of small roller 
upon the roller lie a cylinder six foot long by eighteen inch in diameter

what be -PRON- go to do with -PRON- kennedy -PRON- ask tremulously 
send -PRON- to -PRON- friend by pneumatic tube be the answer 
but rather not go to -PRON- friend in that way 
i a rain of blow dash against the closed door and a clamor of voice demand the surrender of lumley 
with a hollow groan lumley fall backward and wedge -PRON- into the cylinder 
swiftly kennedy close the cover and clamp -PRON- down 
an awful feeling of helplessness and peril take possession of everson lumley 
what if the cylinder should get block in the tube 
how long would the air inside the steel shell support life 
suppose -PRON- give over -PRON- direful supposition abruptly 
the roller be turn beneath the cylinder and -PRON- feel that -PRON- be move forward into the hole in the wall 
a roar of air in violent suction fill -PRON- ear 
a second later -PRON- head be drive into the rear point of the cylinder as -PRON- start suddenly and rush at the weather bureau like a bullet from a gun mile jernyngham weather lumley be too dazed to note when or how the cylinder come to a pause 
-PRON- be conscious of some one work at the upper half of the shell and be presently blink in a bright light as the lid be throw back 
-PRON- hear a yell of consternation and a patter of run foot then an excited voice mr jernyngham 
mr jernyngham 
hush that clamor simpson come a second voice and one of authority the row anyway

lumley fish -PRON- shoe out of the cylinder and turn to follow the weather dictator out of the tuberoom 
get a grip on -PRON- simpson laugh jernyngham as -PRON- pass -PRON- assistant 
i donot wonder that -PRON- be take aback when -PRON- look for rainplug and find -PRON- old friend everson lumley hot in syracuse and -PRON- want a few cloud 
as soon as -PRON- shoot in a hundred dollar push a couple of cloudplug into the syracuse section 
very well sir answer simpson slowly recover -PRON- mental poise 
the way from the tuberoom to the office carry lumley and the dictator through a large chamber in which three meeklooke man of the period be at work 
a large map of the state of new york have be split into three section and fasten to three blank wall 
every town village and crossroad be plainly mark and the entire surface be gouge with hole 
some of these hole be empty 
other be fill with roundheade plug of different color 
on -PRON- way through the room jernyngham pause and cast a critical eye over one of the section 
i guess -PRON- would better pull out that steuben county plug arnold say -PRON- already give -PRON- more rain than -PRON- have pay for 
and i want -PRON- to be more careful with the galeplug arnold 
herkimer county didnot whackup for that last spell of fair weather and i tell -PRON- to switch in one galeplug and -PRON- switch in two 
i just hear that -PRON- unroofe three store in coldbrook and blow over a steeple in fairfield

before -PRON- take hold the weather business be in the hand of a trust drive out the trust corner the muglug and set the people to work 
-PRON- charge only half what the trust charge for weather and everybody ought to be satisfied 
glad to hear -PRON- have cut the price but drive out one trust and replace -PRON- with another isnot just the thing be -PRON- 
and in the case of a public necessity like the weather shouldnot the government have control what -PRON- have grin jernyngham be the government in the state of new york 
but -PRON- wonot discuss this at present hungry and be just go to have breakfast

whew exclaim the weather dictator when the story be do -PRON- fellow do have a time of -PRON- and no mistake 
smith be a pestiferous person and i be glad -PRON- have be put out of the way 
but -PRON- situation lumley be not so perilous as -PRON- appear 
those guard would never have dare to annihilate -PRON- with -PRON- electric gun 
-PRON- know too well that the vengeance of the dictator would be swift and sure 
if -PRON- man have the whole city under -PRON- control ask lumley how be -PRON- possible for any of the citizen of the period to defy -PRON- authority 
that be because -PRON- have dr kelpie explain jernyngham 
-PRON- use the doctor as a club threaten -PRON- with death if -PRON- do not give up the important post -PRON- occupy 
find -PRON- threat would not intimidate -PRON- 
smith use the doctor timemachine to go back into the past after more of -PRON- fellow 
the situation be become pretty jerry dick evolve that plot to help -PRON- escape 
-PRON- know now why -PRON- anticipate activity 
of course be not out of the wood yet by a long shot but be go to hang on to -PRON- power and prerogative great lumley for a bunch of year man to boss this year if -PRON- have a hand in the game -PRON- would know how -PRON- feel have to leave these time mile say lumley

the great good for the great number be -PRON- slogan 
the horror lumley feel be too deep for word

where be the rest of -PRON- friend who escape with -PRON- -PRON- inquire and lindley be pick up by an airship belong to the department of custom kinch and mortimer be rescue by a detachment of muglug under command of jerry dick 
now that -PRON- and jefferson plunkett be account for the only man miss be dr kelpie 
i presume that -PRON- and plunkett be in the hand of the guard 
at this moment simpson begin bring in a number of cover dish and place -PRON- on the table 
the appetizing odor -PRON- bring with -PRON- be most delightful 
-PRON- final act be to place half a dozen cigar in the center of the table and push up a couple of chair

-PRON- be very certain that never in -PRON- whole life have -PRON- be so nearly famish as -PRON- be at that moment 
-PRON- pause on -PRON- way to the table startle by cry from the chartroom 
before jernyngham could investigate the cause of the commotion a short fat man come puff through the office door 
-PRON- face be red and -PRON- little eye glimmer 
in one hand -PRON- hold a small revolver of the ancient pattern and -PRON- fan the point of -PRON- back and forth so that -PRON- cover impartially jernyngham lumley and simpson

simpson do not wait to find a chair but wilt to the floor 
jernyngham and lumley back warily to the seat -PRON- have just vacate and drop into -PRON- again 
still watch the three plunkett move to the table take a chair face -PRON- and rest the elbow of -PRON- gunhand on the white linen 
now listen -PRON- go on go to have a square meal and -PRON- be go to stay right where -PRON- be and watch -PRON- eat -PRON- 
if one of -PRON- make a move or speak a word before i light a cigar there will be firework 
i donot know a thing about electric gun and thunderbolt but buffalo bill -PRON- hasnot anything on -PRON- when -PRON- come to juggle a revolver 
cautiously jefferson plunkett lay the weapon beside -PRON- plate and proceed to relieve the very large famine that have afflict -PRON- for twentyfour hour 
lumley watch -PRON- wistfully even if a little fearfully while jernyngham look on with humorous resignation startling jefferson plunkett make a clean sweep of everything on the table 
double portion of ham and egg fry potato and toast vanish from before -PRON- like magic 
as the food disappear -PRON- complacency grow 
when the plate be empty -PRON- select a cigar sniff at -PRON- with the fastidiousness of a connoisseur smile gratefully and light -PRON- then very coolly -PRON- appropriate the rest of the cigar and stow -PRON- away in -PRON- pocket 
take -PRON- from -PRON- gentleman say -PRON- that i have just experience the pleasant part of this little dream 
-PRON- mind be begin to smooth -PRON- out and have a few lucid interval a cinch that this situation be too many for -PRON- and -PRON- another cinch that i be shanghai and push idto -PRON- against -PRON- will

-PRON- may now -PRON- add indulge in any conversation that seem appropriate 
simpson have slip from the room while plunkett be light -PRON- cigar 
-PRON- now very warily thrust -PRON- head in at the door 
dust be fly in buffalo mr jernyngham -PRON- announce and -PRON- be ask for a hundreddollar sprinkle 
also a request come from the mohawk valley for a thousand dollar worth of soak rain 
very good nodded jernyngham 
as soon as -PRON- hear from the treasury that buffalo and mohawk valley have remit see that the sprinkleplug be switch in for a twentyminute precipitation at buffalo and that mohawk valley be line with rainplug for a twohour downpour 
yes sir 
simpson disappear 
plunkett grab the edge of the table stare at jernyngham and -PRON- low jaw fall 
-PRON- cigar drop into a plate 
after a moment -PRON- mumble to -PRON- pick up the cigar absently and resume -PRON- smoking 
just as begin to feel tolerably comfortable say -PRON- something like this have to happen 
mr plunkett speak up lumley this gentleman be mile jernyngham of the weather bureau 
plunkett acknowledge the introduction with a scowl and a nod 
jernyngham lift -PRON- voice and call for simpson 
duplicate that breakfast order simp say -PRON- and see how quick -PRON- can do -PRON- 
-PRON- turn to plunkett 
lumley and -PRON- go on have just make up -PRON- mind that -PRON- have be recapture so -PRON- appearance here be in the nature of a pleasant surprise 
how do -PRON- get away from the guard miss kennedy attend to that answer plunkett 
-PRON- drop -PRON- through a grating in the diningroom and then lead -PRON- up to the roof in a roundabout way 
there -PRON- board the family flier 
miss kennedy let -PRON- off on top of the weather bureau and tell -PRON- to go down and look for friend 
a derisive smile dig crease in the drummer face 
and i donot think -PRON- finish that i give -PRON- a pleasant surprise when i show up here -PRON- be a surprise all right but the pleasure be mostly -PRON- get to hand -PRON- a piece of -PRON- mind mr plunkett observe jernyngham and i may as well do -PRON- right now 
i hope -PRON- will take -PRON- kindly but -PRON- have get to take -PRON- whether kindly or no 
-PRON- conduct toward those who come with -PRON- to these time have be most reprehensible 
-PRON- seem plunkett to be constantly on the lookout for opportunity to betray -PRON- companion into the hand of -PRON- enemy 
now be a little band of castaway who by -PRON- native shrewdness and ability have succeed in get a strangle hold on -PRON- environment get to hang together understand 
eternal vigilance be the price of -PRON- success 
-PRON- brother tod be the boss dictator and on -PRON- account if for no other reason -PRON- ought to be with -PRON- rather than against -PRON- 
if plunkett be impress with these blunt remark -PRON- fail to show -PRON- 
-PRON- listen to jemyngham with a derisive smile jerry to this all right say -PRON- that everything seem and that nothing really be be dope and when i come to -PRON- can bet -PRON- bottom sou marquee that go to make thing hot for the bunch that work the hocus pocus 
when i wake up i want to have the satisfaction of know that i plug for -PRON- side even while i be under the influence of that funny powder 
just at present little alice plunkett in wonderland and very very busy hunt a way back to junction where i get off 
meanwhile go to be as obstreperous as i can 
simpson come in and begin clear away the table 
lumley watch -PRON- with interest and impatience 
in fact -PRON- be so wrap up in the prospect of that delay breakfast that -PRON- could not feel properly aggrieve at the stand take ly jefferson plunkett 
jernyngham have -PRON- in mind to be very severethere be no doubt at all about thatbut before -PRON- could vent -PRON- indignation upon plunkett something else happen 
a door open and close 
footstep be hear approach hurriedly 
there be another flurry of excitement in the chartroom and kinch fling -PRON- ihto the office 
ah lumley 
kinch exclaim 
glad to see -PRON- jernyngham 
excuse brevity but in the big kind of a rush 
get an airship on the roof and just drop in for a moment to have a word with lumley try to corral all of -PRON- crowd at the office of the chief dictator 
mortimer ripley and be there and lumley be to join -PRON- at once off to get dr kelpie 
how do -PRON- know i be here inquire lumley 
the news come by transmit from kennedy have -PRON- find dr kelpie hear from -PRON- 
the information be bring by one of the guard who be bribe by the doctor 
kelpie be recapture but while -PRON- be free -PRON- manage to hide the timeball now -PRON- s back in the old quarter in amsterdam avenue with the guard double and -PRON- be go to use the thinkograph on -PRON- and discover where -PRON- secrete the main part of the timemachine get to prevent that 
dick be march a strong force of muglug at the doublequick to the kelpie house and need there to direct proceeding 
a sound of quick movement draw all eye toward the office door 
jefferson plunkett be just make a hasty exit 
come back here shout kinch 
be hang to -PRON- flung back plunkett look around and flourish -PRON- revolver 
try to stop -PRON- and shoot not get the want -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- slam the door leave those in the office stare at each other in apprehension and dismay 
confound the fellow grunt jernyngham 
not that this timeball count for much so far as the dictator be concern but -PRON- count for more than -PRON- know cry the exasperate detective 
i wish bring that electric gun 
as -PRON- happen i havenot a weapon of any sort but not let that stand in the way 
with that -PRON- fling open the door of the chartroom 
the operator be huddle in one corner like a lot of frightened sheep 
through the open door of the tuberoom jefferson plunkett could be see puff and flounder on the flight of iron stair that lead to the roof 
follow by lumley and jernyngham kinch plunge on in fierce pursuit 
by the time the three reach the foot of the stair plunkett be out of the roofdoor and by the time the pursuer reach the roof the machine that have bring the detective be on the wing plunkett balance amidship and cover the pilot with -PRON- revolver 
as -PRON- slip swiftly away into space the hardware drummer give vent to a wheezy taunt laugh 
if -PRON- get that timeball cry the panicstricken lumley hell destroy -PRON- 
-PRON- doesnot know -PRON- doesnot understand get to overhaul -PRON- exclaim kinch another flyingmachine 
i say there jernyngham get to have another machine 
jernyngham be haul a red flag to the top of a short staff signal for a municipal flier say -PRON- 
ah ha there s one now head this way 
the municipal machine which pay a license to the air ship department and be for hire round gracefully to a pause above the roof and then settle down into the stay 
kinch and lumley run up the step and clamber aboard 
follow that craft shout kinch point south toward the other airship 
the pilot start -PRON- helicopter and then when -PRON- be swinge well over the roof turn on the propeller doublecross this little game of declare the detective with grim determination 
by what process of reasoning have -PRON- convince -PRON- that -PRON- can get that timeball anyhow why -PRON- s plain crazy there be no doubt of that plain troublesome jasper return lumley and -PRON- seem to have a way of do the wrong thing with a good deal of success 
plunkett the avenger be surely an appropriate name for -PRON- 
i have awful foreboding that -PRON- be on the point of do something rash something that will result in a tremendous catastrophe 
-PRON- forget frowned kinch that plunkett be match wit with -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- break off the conversation give attention to the chase and urge the driver to crowd on more power 
two thing be evident to those in the municipal flier 
one be that the driver be do everything possible to get the good speed out of the machine and the other be that -PRON- be barely hold -PRON- own in the chase overload say the driver a man of the period cry kinch fiercely and on peril of -PRON- life tell -PRON- the truth be -PRON- for or against the dictator 
be there any reason for -PRON- to keep this airship back the driver shiver under the deadly menace of the detective voice and look no quarrel with the dictator -PRON- whimper 
if i have why should i hold this machine back 
the man be chase be one of -PRON- crowd 
i tell -PRON- sir be overload 
kinch appear convinced of the driver sincerity 
never slow in make up -PRON- mind -PRON- have plan the next step before the pilot have do speak 
hover over that roof ahead there -PRON- order point 
stop but donot land 
come to a standstill two or three foot above the landingstage 
very well sir 
sorry lumley say kinch but the craft be overload and -PRON- will have to drop out on that roof and wait until i finish the chase and come back and pick -PRON- up 
but be sure and wait 
all of -PRON- crowd must be get together and keep together bag plunkett and well halt -PRON- troublesome career by keep -PRON- bind and under lock and key 
by lighten ship -PRON- shall be able to overhaul the craft ahead 
lumley be disappointed but -PRON- have the utmost confidence in kinch and promptly fall in with -PRON- plan 
the helicopter be hold the municipal machine a few foot above the landingstage of the strange rooftop 
lumley climb over the side lower -PRON- to arm length and drop 
-PRON- land lightly easily and then watch while the airship resume the chase 
i hope nothing go wrong -PRON- say to -PRON- turn to the edge of the platform and descend a short flight of step to the roof 
if the timeball fall into the hand of -PRON- enemy there s no tell where -PRON- trouble will end 
-PRON- worry on the score of dr kelpie and the timeball have cause -PRON- to forget for the time be that -PRON- have be deprive of the morning meal of which -PRON- stand very much in need 
now that -PRON- have be eliminate from the chase and -PRON- attendant excitement -PRON- mind return wistfully to the subject of -PRON- lose breakfast 
a sort of pergola hard by the landing stage and offer a shelter of flower vine invite -PRON- 
-PRON- enter -PRON- cool shadow and sit down on a cushioned bench 
by a supreme effort of the will -PRON- seek to banish vision of ham and egg fry potato toast and coffee 
as a means to the end -PRON- steer -PRON- thought in other channel 
-PRON- be clear that the member of the rescue society be go to have a hard time pry the dictator loose from -PRON- power and prerogative and carry -PRON- back into the past 
yet -PRON- must be do in some way 
-PRON- have no moral right to tyrannize over the folk of the twentyfirst century 
people of different age be differently constitute 
how would the people of the year have feel if some usurper have come on from the year banish the telegraph for the post rider and retire incandescent bulb in favor of tallowdip 
no no 
surely a man have no right to any other era than that in which -PRON- be bear 
the castaway perhaps not maliciously be perpetrate a great wrong and lumley be grieve to note that a sordid spirit have enter into -PRON- operation and that -PRON- be manipulate the weather the culinary operation and no doubt everything else for -PRON- own financial benefit 
this reflection be cut short 
what be that -PRON- hear 
a groan 
-PRON- start to -PRON- foot and listen intently 
yes there be no mistake 
here be something that demand investigation 
midway of the pergolas length be the builtup hood that shelter the roofdoor 
lumley observe that the door be ajar and -PRON- be not long in determine that the gruesome sound -PRON- have hear be waft through the opening 
cautiously -PRON- advance to the door push -PRON- wide and step through 
descend the broad stairway a short distance -PRON- look over the balustrade and an odd scene reveal -PRON- to -PRON- 
the room into which -PRON- have partly descend be the triclinium or diningroom of the household 
-PRON- be a very rich apartment with wall fresco by the hand of some master artist and with chair and couch upholstered in the costly fabric 
the grating through which the food vapor be will not to ascend be of yellow gold work out in an intricate and graceful design 
on one side of this grating stand a tablea breakfasttable as -PRON- werebrought from some peasant hut and put down in those luxurious surrounding 
-PRON- be cover with a paper cloth and the dish be of tin evidently design for other use and press into service by sudden necessity 
there be a bowlshape dish half full of a dark liquid 
at half a dozen place around the board be plate heap with food a sort of food lumley could not remember ever have see before 
six chair be push back from the table 
those who have be eat be lie on couch or be writhe in chair fill with a misery that find vent in heartwrenche groan 
lumley grasp the situation in a moment 
this be the result of decree these people of the period be try to carry out the term of the new law 
for year -PRON- have sit at -PRON- golden grating converse pleasantly and absorb -PRON- nutrition 
now -PRON- be try to eat the solid nonvaporize nondeodorized food and the result could not be otherwise than painful heart go out to the sufferer even as -PRON- indignation wax strong against the dictator 
-PRON- be a brutal decree 
famish as -PRON- be however the sight of that breakfast tempt -PRON- 
not one of the six member of the household pay -PRON- the slight attention and -PRON- descend quietly draw up one of the chair and sit down at the table 
-PRON- pick up a fragment of something try to determine what -PRON- be by sight and then by taste 
-PRON- be hard and soggy and burn 
-PRON- drop -PRON- 
yes -PRON- be hungry than -PRON- have ever be in -PRON- life but -PRON- couldnot go that 
eat -PRON- command a hollow voice 
-PRON- be call bread in the cookbook 
-PRON- be from those distant time and -PRON- ask a demonstration 
prove to -PRON- that the stuff be edible 
lumley look up 
the man of the house evidently be stand before -PRON- 
-PRON- absurd costume in nowise diminish the touching spectacle -PRON- present 
the pinch face and feverish eye be mute evidence of starvation 
-PRON- dear friend return lumley with feeling i would put up with a good deal of personal inconvenience to eat this bread if -PRON- be possible 
but -PRON- isnot 
-PRON- cook have make a botch of the baking 
try one of those chop beg the man there beside the bread 
chop echo lumley 
these be not chop -PRON- be clinker burn to a cinder 
no one could eat those thing 
have some of the coffee 
lumley try -PRON- and strangle 
i canot -PRON- sputter like to oblige -PRON- if i could but there s a limit to what i can stand even when ravenous 
so come from the other bitterly 
-PRON- be order by these usurper to eat food that even -PRON- can not endure and -PRON- have always be eater while -PRON- have become absorber 
-PRON- nature be delicately attune to the beautiful and the progressive in life and the coarseness of the act of mastication revolt -PRON- even as the odor of the solid food be offensive 
mark -PRON- word decree will prove the undoing of these usurper 
where do -PRON- come from query another voice 
lumley look around 
all the male member of the household four of themwere on -PRON- foot 
the mother and daughter have lift -PRON- on -PRON- couch and be stare at lumley with reproachful eye 
lumley explain that -PRON- have be set down on the roof by a friend and be to be pick up later 
-PRON- be one of the recent arrival 
while on the roof -PRON- have hear groan and out of a desire to relieve a fellow creature distress -PRON- have intrude into the triclinium 
-PRON- hope -PRON- would pardon -PRON- 
-PRON- feel for -PRON- deeply and be sorry -PRON- be powerless to be of any help 
if thy would excuse -PRON- -PRON- would go back to the roof again and wait for -PRON- friend airship 
one of the son spring to the wall and pull a switch 
the roofdoor could be hear to close 
i open that door say the young man so that -PRON- could get the air 
now -PRON- be closed and fasten 
well do exclaim the head of the house 
send a transmit to the headquarters of the opposition one of -PRON- 
-PRON- will turn this man over to -PRON- 
then and for the first time lumley realize that -PRON- generous desire to aid the distressed have plunge -PRON- into trouble 
to get to the roof be impossible 
the elevator opening be in the wall behind -PRON- and -PRON- start up and retreat toward -PRON- 
all the time -PRON- be execute -PRON- retreat toward the elevator -PRON- be plead with -PRON- enraged foe for -PRON- kindly consideration 
one of the son be take down an electric rifle from the wall 
mother and daughter clasped in each other arm be on the verge of hysteria 
but the father torture into fury by decree be eager for hostility 
just as the young man turn with the electric rifle lumley fall backward into the elevator cage 
-PRON- fall body touch the spring that release the car and -PRON- shoot downward at the foot of the shaft -PRON- regain -PRON- foot and plunge through an open door 
-PRON- be on the ground floor of the house and above -PRON- -PRON- could hear sound of wildest commotiontransmit shout to the opposition scream of woman wild shout of the man a patter of foot on broad staircase 
lumley gain a massive street door only to find -PRON- lock 
what be there to do 
-PRON- fight with the door and as -PRON- struggle -PRON- call wildly for help 
-PRON- call -PRON- frantically reason be as useless as -PRON- attempt to open the door 
yet -PRON- must do something and instinctively -PRON- continue to shout and wrench at the barrier with all -PRON- strength 
suddenly there be a crash a ring impact as of a ton of steel hurl against the door on -PRON- outer side 
the stout wood shiver and all but yield 
again come the thunderous attack and this time the door be burst inward 
lumley be fling backward to the floor 
as -PRON- lie there -PRON- have a glimpse of a warrior muglug charge through the breach 
the steel giant bent over lumley lift -PRON- as easily as though -PRON- have be an infant fling -PRON- across one shoulder and make off with -PRON- 
outside the house another muglug of the warrior class join the first and shoulder to shoulder the two rattle and clang -PRON- way down the street 
the relief lumley may otherwise have feel be cloud with uncertainty 
-PRON- be hold to the muglug shoulder by a viselike grip of the iron hand and every attempt -PRON- make to free -PRON- be meet with firm resistance 
the two muglug be at large 
be -PRON- dependable or have -PRON- rebel against the authority of jerry dick and go on a bit of a rampage 
lumley could only wait and worry and hope for the good 
five minute after lumley have be rescue from the house where edict have cause so much distress -PRON- be bear into a great building that fairly roar with activity 
on every hand steel be smite steel and the din be terrific 
muglug be at work build other muglug 
the steel mechanic be divide into group and each group have -PRON- own particular piecework 
here be a dozen or so shape fit and rivet the metal head just beyond these be the torsoworker farther along be the toiler who hinge and joint the wonderful arm and hand over on the right be those whose business -PRON- be to fashion the leg and foot and make perfect the clever joint at thigh knee and ankle and then last of all be the assemble frame where each part be bring together and the complete muglug stamp with a number and lay aside for test and final approval 
lumley over the iron shoulder of the muglug who be carry -PRON- survey the establishment with wonder and admiration 
-PRON- have lose -PRON- fear for the arrival at the factory have convince -PRON- that although the steel warrior be at large -PRON- be by no mean proceed at random 
reassure as to -PRON- own personal safety -PRON- survey the plant with interest as -PRON- be carry through -PRON- 
pass out of the huge workshop the two muglug cross a glassy plot and enter a small building 
lumley be place in a chair and the metal giant who have bring -PRON- range -PRON- side by side along the wall and lift -PRON- hand to -PRON- forehead 
a towheaded usurper of perhaps twentyfive sit at a table in front of a number of blueprint and receive the salute 
at the opposite end of the table be a hatchetfaced thinshanked man who stare at lumley as though at a ghost 
hello archibald grant exclaim lumley 
well what do -PRON- think of this mutter grant 
where the deuce do those muglug pick -PRON- up lumley

as soon as the muglug be finish explain grant -PRON- send -PRON- out into the town to see how -PRON- behave -PRON- under the subconscious ray 
if -PRON- prove tractable and show the proper amount of initiative -PRON- be pass if on the other hand -PRON- be sullen slow in -PRON- movement and backward in obey order -PRON- be repair and try again 
this be most remarkable exclaimed lumley 
-PRON- should not beto -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- book which make such a factory as this possible 
-PRON- be hustle out the muglug as fast as -PRON- can 
-PRON- see the new edict that retire vaporized and deodorized food be a good way from be popular 
a storm be go to break before long and -PRON- have get to have the city properly police 
i should say the edict wasnot popular -PRON- look to -PRON- like a very unwise proceeding 
an elegant piece of graft though chuckle archibald grant already sell a million cookbook and the gold for -PRON- be in the treasury 
a year of this lumley and every one of the dictator will be a plutocrat 
regret and sorrow stab lumley to the heart 
graft graft 
be these dictator think of nothing else 
could -PRON- heap misery upon the people for no other purpose than that of line -PRON- treasury 
lumley feel that -PRON- would soon have to take up the cudgel in defense of an oppressed people 
for the present however there be other matter to claim -PRON- attention 
have -PRON- hear anything about dr kelpie and the timeball -PRON- ask or about pursuit of jefferson plunkett

when -PRON- divide ask lumley where will -PRON- retire to a blank look cross face cross that bridge when -PRON- get to -PRON- -PRON- answer indefinitely 
will -PRON- go back to hardly 
the taste of unlimited power -PRON- have have have change -PRON- whole outlook 
these be pretty good time lumley for man with a little snap and ging a pity -PRON- rescue society ever bother with -PRON- 
everything be go swimmingly until kelpie blow into this era hitch to -PRON- time machine 
-PRON- be the hostage around which all the opposition rally 
if -PRON- hadnot be for -PRON- lumley -PRON- would have have no opposition 
of course when the rest of -PRON- fellow come along the situation be still more complicated get everything pretty well in hand though and there be job for several more dictatorswe can place all of -PRON- late arrival in good position 
lumley shudder 
-PRON- would have express -PRON- in no uncertain term have not -PRON- dinner arrive at that moment 
without loss of time -PRON- begin appease -PRON- hunger 
while -PRON- eat another pair of newly complete muglug be carry into the office by the steelworker in steel from the factory 
these be lay grizzly mechanism of inert metal upon the floor 
in the head of each be an oilcup with a screw top 
haskin open the cup and fill -PRON- from a pipe in the wall 
open the powerplug haskin instruct grant and then send a transmit to head center for two more ray 
haskin open a little doofin the back of each muglug head and tinker for a moment with the powerplug 
after this -PRON- enter the transmitroom and send in -PRON- call to head center 
sit in -PRON- deskchair archibald grant bend two keenly critical eye on the prostrate steel giant 
one of -PRON- lift -PRON- hand as the subconscious ray allot to -PRON- by head center take hold and the other begin to quiver uncannily 
get up order grant 
with a ringing jump each muglug gain -PRON- foot imbue with power from the labor human mind at head center 
have -PRON- make the record haskin inquire grant 
the assistant be write in -PRON- book

-PRON- two proceed grant again address the muglug will proceed to the hudson river and return by way of the pleasure garden to this office 
be go an hourno longer 
go 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand authoritatively 
one of the muglug whirl on -PRON- iron heel and start out 
the other hesitate an ominous whirring sound issue from -PRON- hollow interior 
the sledge haskin call grant rise 
haskin grip an iron hammer that hang in a rack on the wall 
at the same moment the defective steel giant rush at grant like a modern monster upon puny frankenstein 
grant leap clear and haskin strike a clanging blow on the muglug head with the hammer 
a vital spot have be touch and the powerplug disarrange 
the steel warrior clump down on the floor in a disorganized mass and twitch and struggle feebly 
haskin bound into the transmitroom and could be hear signal head center 
mug defective 
withdraw the ray 
instantly no stiffen out and lie silent and still 
-PRON- happen once in a while remark grant grimly 
call a couple of worker haskin and send to the repairshop 
as two toiler from the workshop be carry away the defective muglug a glitter airship hover suddenly over the grassy sward between the office and the factory then drop lightly and swiftly into the factory hangar 
through the open door of the office lumley could see a determinedlooking man step out of the craft and come down the hangar step 
on either side of -PRON- march a warrior muglug overlay with gold and silver filigreework and arm with an electric rifle 
now what s up remark grant in a puzzled tone the chief dictator and -PRON- isnot due to inspect the plant for a week yet wrong that s a cinch 
escort by -PRON- glittering bodyguard tod plunkett the chief dictator hasten across the strip of lawn and enter the office 
how be -PRON- tod cry lumley rise to greet the chief dictator 
lumley old man return plunkett effusively the sight of -PRON- be good for sore eye 
welcome again to the year thing be vastly different now from what -PRON- be on -PRON- previous visit 
the castaway have get a stranglehold on the time old chap and be out for reform with a big a job wait for -PRON- and as soon as i get the transmit from the muglug factory give news of -PRON- whereabout i climb into the meteor and fly over this way 
say lumley -PRON- will never want to leave want to cast in -PRON- lot with -PRON- and become one of the dictator 
all the other who come with -PRON- have accept place of power and -PRON- couldnot think of leave -PRON- out that ask lumley thinking -PRON- have not hear aright 
do -PRON- mean to say that kinch mortimer ripley and and dr kelpie have become dictator 
exactly laugh tod plunkett 
kinch be dictator of the secret service and -PRON- fee and perquisite should amount to several million a year split up the department of food raiment and beverage and mortimer go in as dictator of raiment while rule the beverage bureau 
i leave mortimer prepare an edict which make -PRON- a crime to wear bloomer of the period and declare that on and after thirty day from date clothing of the year must be secure from the tailor of the raiment department that for a rakeoff 
ripley become dictator of dentistry and medicine and already -PRON- department be rush to death on account of edict -PRON- return brain be dizzy 
but what be dr kelpie do -PRON- interrupt hoarsely 
-PRON- be dictator of microcosmology reply plunkett 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to watch the play of the various element in -PRON- little world and advise as to what must be do to keep in good health the goose that lay the golden egg 
i hope -PRON- understand what i mean and the chief dictator give a shrewd wink 
the room be whirl around lumley and -PRON- grip the back of a chair to steady -PRON- 
-PRON- have be count upon -PRON- fellow member of the rescue society for aid in persuade the castaway to leave career of tyranny and graft and go back comfortably to now these prop have fall away from -PRON- -PRON- have even go to support that nefarious structure of oppression and tribute so cunningly raise by the usurper 
everson lumley stand alonealone against all this cruel greed which the twentieth century have unload upon the twentyfirst 
ah dr kelpie dr kelpie who could have believe -PRON- of -PRON- 
but stay 
lumley have one think like a forlorn hope 
tod say -PRON- what office have -PRON- give -PRON- brother jefferson 
i havenot see jefferson as yet be the reply but i shall certainly have a good dictatorship for jeff 
as for -PRON- lumley what more fitting than that -PRON- should be supervisor general of the subconscious ray 
-PRON- can have a blue and gold office in the head center building and make sure that the ray be at all time efficient and properly direct no chance for graft but what s the odd all -PRON- picking be throw into a common fund and when -PRON- have have enough of the game well split even 
what do -PRON- say lumley have not the slight intention of ally -PRON- with the freebooter 
-PRON- be consecrate to the one purpose of rescue all of -PRON- from -PRON- reprehensible career and restore -PRON- to sphere of respectable activity in -PRON- own time 
but if -PRON- gain -PRON- end against such overwhelming odd -PRON- must proceed warily have to think about -PRON- tod -PRON- say 
i canot give -PRON- an answer offhand 
better come in with -PRON- lumley urge archibald grant see about that later be evasive response 
i think tod -PRON- go on to the chief dictator that decree be a mistake 
-PRON- be cause a tremendous amount of distress and the people will not put up with -PRON- 
that decree i should judge from -PRON- limited observation be the last straw 
tod plunkett frown 
the people will have to put up with -PRON- -PRON- declare 
-PRON- muglug army will force -PRON- to carry out the term of the edict 
the will of the dictator be the law of the land 
come along with -PRON- lumley go back to headquarters 
the head dictator turn to grant
