i a guy herbert arrived in concord dakota terri tory on the noon train
as soon as he had re moved the stains of travel and eaten his luncheon he made haste to inquire his way to the office of the concord blizzard
the blizzard was reckoned a very potential power throughout dakota and not to have heard of it was synonymous with being a stranger in that part of the country
a man named keever colonel archibald keever if you pleasepresided over the destinies of the blizzard
his was also the guiding hand that manipulated the affairs of the concord townsite company in those booming times of guy had to do with the colonel on matters appertaining to the townweighty mat ters so far as guy was concerned
the building that harbored the sanctum with its accompanying plant was an unsightly two this was in and at that time the territory had not been divided
his friend the enemy story structure covered with tar paper held in place with strips of lath
a flight of crazy stairs clung to the outside and guy somewhat doubtful of their stability laid hold of the handrail and ascended cautiously
at the landing above he turned sharply to the left and was confronted by a door bearing this printed placard wipe your feet on the mat
guy scraped his shoes assiduously and passed into the sanctum
one would hardly have thought that in such a musty little cubbyhole the powerful mind of archibald keever was wont to evolve those gems of editorial wit which had made the blizzard venerated and feared all the way from fargo to bismarck and from standing rock as far north as turtle mountain
yet such was the fact
guy looked about him with interest
insurance calendars farming implement adver tisements a cheap lithograph of topsy and an other of eliza pursued by bloodhounds did their little mite toward covering the rough board walls
two tenpenny nails affixed to the board wall by half their length supported a white hat and a cane
a window containing eight panes of dusty a stranger in his own town glass let in a mellow light upon the great man who sat at a desk his profile to the caller and took no notice of him
evidently the editor was in the throes of composition
guy had no desire to interrupt and remained standing very quietly in the center of the floor
scratch scratch scratch
humped over that antiquated desk with his old steel pen scraping away as for dear life what fire the colonel must have been throwing into that editorial guy observed him curiously
the colonel was not tall but rather short
he was also very stouta pudgy man with an ex tremely pudgy countenance
his face was red the tip of his nose conspicuously so
he wore a mus tache and chin whiskers both gray and bristling and cut in the fiercest form compatible with high respectability
the better to show the illustrious bumps nature had denuded of hair the greater portion of his scalp
phrenology had been a pastime study of and he observed how beginning at the temples the hirsute fringe bor dered the head passing at the back no higher than the topmost limits of philoprogeni tiveness imperfectly developed
two small eyes murky but wide apart claimed final atten tion
the caller realized suddenly that he had been in the office for quite a considerable period
if the colonel could not grant an interview he might say so and guy would call again
the young his friend the enemy i man coughed
the colonel frowned raised hand his left heavily in token of silence and scratched on
guy swung on his heel and started for the door
colonel cried a shrill voice get away let him maybe he wants to subscribe l guy was startled
he halted and peered about the room finally detecting a cadaverous ink begrimed face topped with a snarl of red hair
this face was peering into the sanctum from the workroom through an unused stovepipe hole cut in the partition
the redhaired boy grinned as he caught eye and dodged away to escape a paperweight which the colonel hurled at him
the aim was bad and guy observed that the opening was bordered with dents and abrasions
by gad exclaimed the editor angrily that imp has knocked the tar out of one of the finest things i have set hand to in many a day
if the people ever find out what they lose on ac count of that graceless cub theyll rise up as one man and hang him no doubt about it
whirling in his pivot chair he glowered at his caller
perhaps i had better go and come back at some more convenient time said guy
the mischief has been done and my inspiration is knocked into a cocked hat answered the colonel softening
if you wish to subscribe for my excellent paper twofifty a year in advance i shall be pleased to enter your name on the books
a stranger in his own town presume i am addressing col keever
you are sir you are do not wish to subscribe colonel but have come on other business
the colonel looked disappointed nevertheless he waved his hand hospitably towards a chair
very well sir
what can i do for you
my name is herbert guy herbert answered the young man
the other acknowledged receipt of the information with a nod
you were the manager of the townsite company were you not
were cried the colonel am sir at the present moment
three men owned the townsite continued guy mr harlow briggs president of the railroad mr edward thomas a lumber dealer in st paul and mr montfort herbert
mr briggs and mr thomas sold out to mr herbert and mr young mans voice two months ago you donot tell me ejaculated the colonel
of course i know all about the company in fact i am on familiar terms with briggs and thomas and both knew and admiredadmired i say sir mr montfort herbert
the colonel settled back in his chair and shook his head sadly
and so herbert is gone he murmured
this news comes with appalling suddenness
mr montfort herbert resumed guy was my father
his friend the enemy your father the colonel struggled to his feet rushed upon guy and wrenched his hand powerfully
my dear boy this would be a happy moment for me were you not the bearer of such sorrowful news
the colonel dropped hand reached behind him to the tails of his coat and brought forth a large bandanna handkerchief
applying this to his eyes he proceeded to pace the narrow confines of the sanctum while rallying from the blow
guy was surprised at this manifestation of feel ing
he was aware that his father had known col keever well so well that having acquired entire charge of the town he was on the point of dispensing with the managers services at the time his last illness came upon him
halting under the stovepipe hole the colonel recovered the paperweight again seated himself and laid both paperweight and handkerchief on the desk beside him
as mr briggs and mr thomas sold out to my father observed guy and since i am my fathers sole heir it naturally follows that guy hesitated
it naturally follows that you own the town finished the colonel princely inheritance my boy
do you think so queried guy hopefully do providing we can keep the countyseat
then i hope concord will be able to keep it said the young man fervently
aside from a few a stranger in his own town hundred dollars this town is all my father left me
the face lengthened
guy observed this and augured direfully the matter with the countyseat he asked understood that concord had it hard and fast my boy are peculiar institu tions
in this country it takes a countyseat to make a town consequently every settlement in a county that has been able to euchre the govern ment out of a postoffice feels in duty bound to step in and try for it
you are familiar i sup pose with the fight we have had up here know that the town of harmony was beaten at the polls a year or more ago i thought that settled the question
it should have settled the question but it didnot
harmony is like ghost and wonot down
do you know what the harmony ites under the leadership of that arch conspirator wilbur vlandingham have done
well tell you of the qualified voters of goodwill county have signed and pre sented a petition to the county commissioners praying that the countyseat be removed to har mony and the commissioners have ordered a special election to be held for the purpose of vot ing upon the question
this mind you is in direct violation of the law the colonel brought his friend the enemy his clenched fist down on his desk with a vim that made the ink leap out of its stand and prostrated the pen rack
what say the statutes he de manded
they expressly stipulate that the peo ples will with respect to changing the location of countyseats shall be learned at the general elec tion directly following the presentation of the petition praying for such change
now they have called a special election
a sandbag game sir
robbery rank robbery
if its illegal why canot it be stopped asked guy
the indignation dropped away and he smiled indulgently
this is dakota my dear young man
the commissioners are under the thumb of vlanding ham
but you wait
archibald keever is to the fore and the blizzard lives beat them i tell you
how the colonel tapped his brow significantly
it requires a twothirds vote to capture the countyseat away from us he replied have arranged matters so that harmony will never be able to roll up a sufficient ajority
the colonel arose and alked to the window
come here mr herbert uy passed over and stood beside him
behold my confidence in the outcome added the colonel with a sweep of his arm
what guy saw was a building in process of construction
at least a dozen men a stranger in his own town were working upon it and even a novice like guy could see that they were very much in each others way lot of carpenters for a small house like that commented the young man should say so chuckled the colonel
those men were brought in from jimtown and theyre voters every mothers son of thein got others building roads and repairing bridges
he closed one of his murky little eyes slowly and slyly vote as i tell them to mr her bert and therell be enough of them to kill har mony too dead to skin
he threw up the win dow
hello there jordan l he called to a man who was working languidly with a saw
you fellows are getting along altogether too fast
take a layoff this afternoon
instantly all work ceased tools were left where last used and the twelve workmen hurried away in a body
the colonel closed the window and beamed upon guy complacently the courthouse theyre building he explained
rather a small courthouse isnot it
oh it will grow it will grow
where does the money come from inquired guy anxiously worry about the money my boy
i sold a batch of lots to a tenderfoot a few weeks ago and its his money thats doing all this
it doesnot seem just right to rush voters in in that way col keever
his friend the enemy right thats successful up in this territory
this is my little plan and of course harmony isnot laying back on its oars and wait ing for me to grab the persimmons
vlandingham and his lieutenants dingle harp blue and boomer are going to do something but just what remains to be seen
they have a town meeting over at harmony tonight to discuss ways and means for getting ahead of me the smile faded into a look of trouble give a hundred dollars said he to know what kind of a scheme they hatch up at that meeting have lynxeyed men on watch however to make sure that no concord fellows get in
the colonel turned and wandered reflectively about the office
guy sat down again and watched him thoughtfully
finally the colonel halted thrust his thumbs into the armholes of his vest and declared herbert youre the man l the man for what
to run over to harmony and take in that meeting a stranger in this section and they wonot know you from adam
be careful though and donot give yourself away
feeling is running high and both sides are exceedingly bit ter
if you were to be found out youd have a rough experience
ever carry a revolver s then get one
i havenot anything but the office gun and canot spare that
a stranger in his own town col keever said guy reddening not going to make a spy out of myself
tush tush not doing anything dis honorable cut my tongue out before counsel anything of that kind a high minded young can see that at a glance and i admire you for it
but those fellows on the other side of the county are blackguards every one of them
they are laying their plans to steal the countyseat away from you and all you are to do is to discover what their plans are if possible so we may balk them in their nefarious attempt
my boy you have something like lots in this town
that means a fortune for you if we can keep the countyseat
if we lose the county seat your lots will be worth just what theyll bring for farming purposes and no more
nor is that the worst of it
let harmony win in this election and every man woman and child now living in concord will pull up stakes and move over to the other town
they wouldnot leave their homes and their places of business would they queried guy aghast
not much they wouldnot leave take em along
you could put wheels under the national capitol and move it a hundred miles over these prairies without jarring out a brick or a chunk of mortar
my word for it mr herbert let harmony win and there wonot be so much as a hencoop left to mark the site of the present town of concord
his friend the enemy go said guy thought you would returned the colonel approvingly a freight down at six thirty
take that
copy bawled a voice through the hole in the partition
the colonel made a dive for the paperweight and the redheaded printer vanished in a flash have to grind out some stuff for that rascal or hell drive me crazy exclaimed the colonel tossing his hands
then i wonot bother you any longer said guy have to be discreet went on the col onel following the young man to the door let those harmony chaps get an inkling as to who you are or what youre there for thats all
keep your plans to yourself and donot talk about them to any one in this place a bad leak in this community somewhere and more than one choice plan of mine has floated out of it and drifted over to the enemy the word and i shall expect a good report from you in the morning
the colonel gave the young mans hand a part ing grip closed the door on him and then seated himself before his desk and resumed his scratching clay in my hands soliloquized the col onel blithely can do as i please with him and can make or mar the future of this townwhich ever is the more profitable
a stranger in his own town out in the workroom the redheaded printer had been doing some peculiar things
the moment guy had left he had thrust the brushend of a broom out through an open window and then on the reverse side of an old piece of copy he had writ ten the following guy herbert son of the late montfort herbert arrived in concord at noon and at this hour just left the old man going over to the town meeting tonight to get some pointers watch out for him about twenty two or three five feet eleven or possibly six feet tall dark hair and mustache and looks as though he was built for business
that was all
the printer neither addressed the note nor signed it and the moment he finished writing the last word a soft tap fell on the back door
the printer made haste to answer the knock
a man stood outside at the head of the rear stairwaya strapping big fellow with his trousers tucked in his boottops
he and the printer ex changed winks as the scrap of paper was handed over
then the big fellow noiselessly descended and the printer noiselessly closed the door and removed the broom from the window
that leak was through the stovepipe hole in the blizzard office
guy had four hours and a half at his disposal before the freight train left concord and he made up his mind that he would put in the time looking over the town
before descending the decrepit stairs leading from the blizzard office he lingered at the top to scan the three points of the compass that were open to him
as the building occupied by the newspaper was well at the foot of the main thoroughfare nearly the whole of concord lay under the young mans eye
certainly no eulogies were to be wasted upon that collection of houses and stores
the princi pal street had roads debouching to left and right
buildings were not huddled together on the con trary they were far apart with stretches of virgin prairie between them
it had been the policy of the townsite company to donate a lot in each block in the residence portion to any one who would build a house upon it
for this reason nearly every dwelling had a block to itself
main street began at the northern pacific depot and ran south for half a mile beyond the blizzard building the latter closing up the ragged file of his friend the enemy store structures
just south of the depot was a huge barnlike hotel
the hotel be it observed always formed the nucleus of the boom town
across from the hotel was the office of a real estate agent south of that on the same side was a building erected by the townsite company for a bank then there was a drug store and then mr benjamin emporium and then a livery stable the latter almost opposite the blizzard building
between the latter and the hotel was the new courthouse
as guy gave further attention to the court house he saw something which had before escaped him namely a weathervane
this vane was cut into the profile of a mans head hand before the face thumb to the nose and digits outspread
the head looked steadily and insolently westward and refused to move with the northeast wind anger arose at the sight
he had no idea what such a vane might mean but he would tolerate nothing of that kind in his town
that vane was to come down in a very short time even if he had to remove it himself
descending the stairs he went over to the em porium and introduced himself to the proprietor
mr glimmer was a slender man of sallow com plexion and looked at the world through iron framed spectacles
he was glad to meet guy and presented him to several citizens among others elisha the postmaster lemuel bil kins a youth of harmless aspect whose abnor in the hostile camp mally long and spiderlike legs were the standing joke of the town christopher waffle justice of the peace and proprietor of a threshing outfit and bill comfort who operated judge engine
conversation with these gentlemen re vealed such a depth of animosity and bitterness over the countyseat question that guy was sur prised
the harmony folks have threatened to come down on us like assyrians on the fold and run off with the county records observed mr glimmer his thin lips compressing and his eyes gleaming through his glasses fool em if they try it on i can tell you only to pull this rope he laid his hand on a rope that dangled through a hole in the a bell on the roof ll ring out a warning and bring every citizen to the new courthouse
and every citizen will bring a gun l snapped waffle
and use it if necessary thundered coming from the fairly peaceable confines of chicago this warlike language filled guy with considerable apprehension
it likewise gave him a realizing sense of the danger of the mission he was about to undertake
if the harmony people were aroused in a similar degree to be discovered tak ing notes at their town meeting would refrained from following out this train of thought
he did not care to anticipate the disaster which would probably befall him in case of discovery
his friend the enemy truth to tell this work was being entered upon against the counsel of his honor
in love and war however all means are supposed to be fair and he was endeavoring to apply that principle in the present case
nevertheless he was troubled
the oclock freight had a few cases of merchandise for concord and while these were being unloaded guy climbed into the caboose on the rear of the train counted as many as three people father broke upon ears in a feminine voice that was richly musical
one of those is the station agent betty and doesnot count replied a voice of masculine tim bre so deep it was almost a roar
guy discovered the second speaker instantly
he was a large man wearing a black slouch hat and was sitting on a seat that ran along the side of the car his eyes close to a window and eagerly observing the town
the other speaker was not so easily located but guy found her at last
she was perched on a stool up in the lookout or cupola and was also studying the main street with eager gaze was hoping to catch a glimpse of the gallant colonel continued the girl with a ripple of laughter
subtract him from concord and the result is naught
huh exclaimed the father without looking around
keever is the biggest cipher in the the young lady was precipitated fairly and squarely into the young mans in the hostile camp whole layout
everybody will know that one of these days canot understand went on the girl why more people havenot come down to see that the train arrives and departs properly
pardon me put in guy whimsically halting below the young lady and looking up at her the people here do not manifest the same interest in a freight that they do in a passenger
besides there are two men and a dog behind the depot whom you have overlooked
the large man at the side of the car switched around and fixed his eyes on the speaker
the girl also turned in her seat in a startled way and looked down
she was a very handsome girl her fine cleancut features possessing the charm of womanly resolu tion and firmness
symmetry was the keynote of face and form and the eyes the lips and the square dimpled chin all told of underlying strength
from the viewpoint of a physiognomist she delighted guy and it may be that the joy of his character study betrayed itself for the young lady suddenly assumed a haughty air which be came her amazingly
she vouchsafed him a frigid stare tossed her head disdainfully and then well just then the train gave a terrific jerk in the uncomfortable manner that all freight trains have and the young lady was precipitated from her perch fairly and squarely into the young mans arms
guy was a good sailor and able to keep his friend the enemy his feet in the hardest kind of a blow so he re mained upright and was able to save the young lady from any ill effects that might have accom panied her fall
undoubtedly she was grateful but she did not show it
her face was in a flame as guy released her and her white teeth closed bitingly on her red underlip
jupiter but that was neatly done exclaimed the large man heartily
betty why donot you thank him
that drop might have hurt you my girl
had he not attracted my attention flared miss betty would not have lost my hold
these freight trains are simply insufferable and this is the very last time i shall ever ride on one
allow me said guy
stooping he picked up a chain bracelet which had become unclasped from miss dainty wrist
she took it from him replaced it around her glove and then seated herself on one of the side seats just where the last flicker of sunlight touched her reddish hair into gold
a very pretty picture she was too sitting stiffly erect in her injured dignity and looking neither to right nor left
the large man shifted his twinkling eyes from her and gave guy a wink your line he asked donot understand you returned guy
drummer i take it
the large man squinted about vicinity as though searching for sample cases
in the hostile camp guy was annoyed especially as miss sense of the ridiculous prevailed over all and al lowed a smile to twitch at the corners mouth
you are mistaken sir said guy of her am not a drummer
been long in concord few hours only
that was as long as you could stand it i suppose
well i donot blame you
if you want to make a little money during this boom youve got to buy lots in a live town like harmony
my names vlandingham young man
guy had been on the point of saying that he already had more lots than he knew what to do with but the large mans announcement of his name caused him to take another course
here undoubtedly was the very vlandingham who had the county commissioners under his thumb and was the ringleader of the conspiracy to steal the countyseat away from concord
guy became wary on the instant
my name is herbert mr vlandingham said he am going over to have a look at har mony
mr herbert my daughter miss elizabeth vlandingham
the easy familiarity of the northwest had long since claimed wilbur vlandingham for its own and he presented the stranger to his daughter with a cheerful disregard of the proprieties
but if he 3o his friend the enemy forgot himself miss betty was far from being ruled by his example
to profound bow she re turned only the curtest of nods two little wrinkles between her brows showing her disapproval of her fathers course
mr vlandingham smiled and winked again
harmony he resumed is my town mr herbert
our town corrected miss betty
certainly my love deferred her father whatever is mine will some day be yours
he turned once more to guy
harmony is going to have the countyseat mr herbert and the mo ment the result of this special election is known lots will go up with a jump
leaning sidewise confidentially he tapped guy on the knee
take my advice
buy a few lots before the rise have to think about it said guy
of course and while you are thinking about it you are to accept the hospitality of my humble home
miss betty shot a quick glance of protest in her fathers direction
really mr vlandingham answered guy couldnot think of such a thing
it was one thing to prevent his fortunes from being wrecked by reconnoitering the enemy but it was quite another thing to sit at table with the general of the hostile camp and carry the espial into his very household
guy drew a line at that
nonsense cried vlandingham wonot in the hostile camp have it any other way going with me and i wonot take no for an answer
it is impossible returned guy firmly
by jupiter well see about that
in my own townbeg pardon betty our own townthings go about as wewant them to go appreciate your kindness said guy em barrassed by the persistent nature of vlanding hams hospitality but i cannot impose upon you
impose hear that betty
he talk of im posing on meon usafter saving your life my girl
think of how you would now be lying crushed and broken on that car floor but for his heroic assistance jupiter mr herbert i owe you a debt of gratitude
buy two lots at the present price and throw in two more
now then l guy was overwhelmed
miss betty bowed her head and her shoulders moved convulsively
see how my daughter is affected cried vlan dingham
she understands how much we owe you mr herbert and a smothered laugh came from miss betty
she looked up presently straightening her face with an effort
guy was chagrined
the more he saw of elizabeth vlandingham the more he wished they had met under happier circumstances
my father mr herbert remarked the young lady is very anxious to sell our lots
he has forgotten that there are none for sale
his friend the enemy what gasped vlandingham aghast
after the election the lots will be worth double what they are now and why should we divide our profits with any one
miss betty had a delightfully contrary nature
had guy accepted her fathers hospitality she would have been set against him but now that he was determined not to accept she was equally determined that he should
mr herbert she went on allow me to second my fathers invitation
we shall be glad to have you stay at willowview while you are in harmony
the witchery of her blue eyes made the tempta tion a powerful one yet guy shook his head
then the blue eyes grew imperious
you must declared miss betty and guy yielded under mental protest
a few minutes later they were in harmony descending from the caboose far below the depot and proceeding cross lots towards a large and comfortablelooking group of farm buildings framed in a dusky setting of willows
evening had fallen too darkly for guy to see very much of this rival town but assuredly there was nothing in concord to compare with wilbur palatial home
willowview was a manor com prising in its entirety almost a thousand broad acres abutting upon the townsite
the house was large and neatness itself without and within
dinner was waiting and after guy had removed in the hostile camp the cinders and dust with which the short journey by freight train had liberally covered him he joined miss betty and her father in the diningroom
there were only the three of them and guy was not long in learning that mrs vlandingham had been dead for several years
the daughter had taken the mothers place in the household and was filling it if guy might judge with eminent credit to herself and with supreme satisfaction to her father
the dinner was charming
miss betty made herself most agreeable and there was no talk of lots or townsite matters or anything else that breathed remotely of business or discord
guy forgot for the time the mission he had undertaken at the behest
he was brought to him self however with something like a shock directly after dinner while he and mr vlandingham were in the parlor listening to miss piano playing
there came a sharp ring at the doorbell fol lowed by a colloquy between the maid and some person or persons without
the next moment there was a tread of feet and four gentlemen marched into the parlor single file their hats in their hands
the gentleman in the lead was a very small person and from the way his left eye focused itself unswervingly on a given point while its fellow roved at will there was small doubt that the left eye was glass
behind the leader came a gentle his friend the enemy man of towering heighthe was taller even than guy or mr his framework was so loosely put together he could not seem to talk without jarring himself the third of the quartet had a wooden leg and the sleeve of the fourth was folded over and tucked in the front of his coat
miss vlandingham exclaimed the man with the glass eye your most obedient he bowed and his three companions bowed with him
the spokesman executed an about face and directed his attention at miss father the rest of the squad participating in the movement
evening squire he said starting a nod that tilted every head in the row
good evening gentlemen returned vlanding ham courteously oclock
have you forgotten
not at all
mr vlandingham consulted his watch
it is close to thats a fact
betty and i came down on a freight from jimtown colonel so that be here in time to connect with the town meeting
vlandingham turned to guy
mr herbert allow me to present to you col man with the glass eye bowed major from the giant capt from the gentleman with the wooden mr boomer
the man with the empty sleeve ducked amiably
the colonel continued mr vlandingham conducts our paper the harmony won dered if all the colonels in dakota conducted in the hostile camp major by grace of the republican administration hands us our mail the captain is proprietor of the bee hive store and mr the nation do you do boomer anyhow
just hang around squire smiled mr boomer it said vlandingham
mr herbert gentlemen will probably invest in some harmony lots
guy raised his hand in protest
after the election supplemented mr vlandingham
we have a town meeting tonight mr herbert and you might go along with us and rub up against some of our best citizens
squire exclaimed the man with the glass eye crooking his finger
vlandingham bent down and col dingle whis pered to him earnestly
nonsense said vlandingham in a low tone which nevertheless reached ears vouch for him
when the six of them finally started for the meeting conscience was sadly troubling him
he would rather a thousand times have remained behind and spent the evening with miss betty
a the town meeting was held in a vacant room over the bee hive store
so far as guy could make out harmony and concord were very much alike except that in concord the business places were ranged along a main street while in har mony they were grouped about a vacant square
this was a distinction without much of a differ ence
the square mr vlandingham informed guy was reserved for the courthouse
in the event that harmony won the contest guy won dered what he and col keever would do with their courthouse
a lamp burned in the entrance leading up to the hall and a sternlooking man with a rifle over his arm blocked the way
how is everything marley inquired vlan dingham
nothin suspicious so fur squire replied marley staring at guy
got sentries posted all around this building
sure
no one that ainot on the square can come within a block of it right
vlandingham and his party ascended the stairs
his friend the enemy at the top they passed the scrutiny of another guard and entered the meeting room
there were some twenty or thirty men in the hall and vlan dingham made for a platform at the farther end of the room nodding to citizens on either side and speaking a word here and there as he pro gressed introduce you all around after the meeting is over he whispered to guy want some lots i know you will and see that you get them no matter what betty says
guy had no time just then once more to dis avow any intention of purchasing real estate in harmony for vlandingham was late and the impatient people wasted not a moment in having the meeting called to order
guy sat on the platform with vlandingham col dingle major harp capt blue and mr boomer
these five as guy quickly learned con stituted a committee of safety and ways and means
vlandingham was elected chairman and as they had no use for a secretary the business was begun immediately
the first man to get the floor was a mr pink ney
mr pinkney was excited to a hysterical degree
he shook in body and limb and during his agitated delivery of the matter that oppressed him his voice broke often from excess of wrath and indignation
business had called him to the eastern side of the county that day mr chairman and fellow a friend in need citizens and in returning he had driven boldly back through the outskirts of that pitiful excuse for a town called concord
yes sir and no one had dared to raise a hand against him
and what do you think he saw mr chairman what do you think he saw with his own eyes
at this point mr pinkney gulped his words choked on them and finally managed to articulate hoarsely
why on that rattletrap of a building which the wretched keever is erecting for a courthouse he actually saw a weathervane a monstrous thing which answered to no wind of heaven but pointed ever and always in the direction of harmony
and what was that weathervane mr chairman and gentlemen what was it
it was a mans head sir a mans head and hand and the hand was doing this looking straight towards harmony all the time and doing this doing this at their honorable chairman at col dingle major harp capt blue and mr boomer yes gentlemen doing this at all of you
mr pinkney made a weathervane of himself for purposes of illustration
with his thumb to his nose and his trembling fingers outspread he di rected the opprobrious gesture at vlandingham then in turn at each member of the committee of safety and then at the entire meeting
guy was consumed with a desire to laugh but suppressed it strenuously
it was not a laughing matter for the citizens in the hall and not one detected a trace of humor in the situation
a 4o his friend the enemy murmur of rage swept through the assemblage and col dingle sprang to his feet with a fierce cry
they are all hoodlums and rowdies on the other side of the county he shouted tossing his arms and the archfiend who leads the rab ble is that schemer that political trickster that preminent rascal archibald keever
in a twinkling the meeting was in an uproar
every citizen was talking wildly and shaking his clenched fists
vlandingham pounded for order
when a measure of quiet finally obtained he spoke a few words himself
we must be quiet we must be calm we must not allow our passions to run away with us
let us remember that it is the cool head and the dar ing hand that win the day
they have flung the gage at us and we will bear with this insolence now and return it a hundredfold
col dingle we will hear from you
mr pinkney sat down and col dingle calming himself with a painful effort declared that this gratuitous insult could have been the work of none other than keever that he came from ken tucky as did the aforesaid keever and that he wanted the meeting to appoint him a committee of one to ride directly into the town of concord and slap the aforesaid face
he would do it and he would abide by the consequences
barely had this duty been laid upon col shoulders when an uproar was heard be a friend in need i low at the street entrance
the noise increased and swept up the stairs and the cause of it all presently burst open the door and dashed into the room
a wildeyed strapping big fellow with his trousers tucked into his boottops was among them
he was covered with dust and his face was ominous and eager traitor he shouted waving a scrap of paper over his head a traitor in this room
during the foreboding silence that followed heart beat like a triphammer traitor barney queried vlandingham getting up and sweeping his gaze over the people before him
his voice was soft but there was a metallic glitter in his eyes as he advanced to the edge of the platform
come here barney he added indicating a cleared space in front of him come here and tell us about it
boomer you and the captain will please guard the exit
the captain stumped away to the door followed by boomer both frowning heavily
mr boomer grimly developed a revolver got the information from the broom man said barney approaching as he had been directed to do and presenting the folded paper would have got here sooner but that broncho of mine consarn him lgot scared and threw me so i had to walk half the way
vlandingham unfolded the note and read it silently
guy who was watching him narrowly his friend the enemy saw his face slightly redden and observed a twitch ing of his heavy irongray mustache
the deep stillness was at last broken by the chairman
is there a hunchback man in this room he demanded sternly
there was not and guy was participating in the general feeling of relief when barney cried out hunchback squire
that doesnot say any thing about a hunchback thought you couldnot read barney re turned vlandingham accompanying the words with a severe look
no more i canot squire
i can spell out print tolerable well but writin is a point beyond me
i stopped at your house though on the way in and miss betty read the note aloud and sent me along here in a hurry
she said i wasnot to give the note to any one but you
was it disappointment or consternation that afflicted vlandingham
guy wondered as he sur veyed him have been possessed with the idea gentle men continued the chairman addressing the meeting that trouble is to be expected through the agency of a hunchback
this note doesnot describe such a person but i know who the man is
if mr turned to guy and handed him the assist us we will be able to capture him without trouble or violence
please read that mr herbert and inform me whether a friend in need you are acquainted with the individual de scribed
guy glanced at the writing hurriedly
yes sir he replied know him
will you go with barney here apprehend the fellow and see that he stays at my house until i come
guy saw how vlandingham was trying to save him
he noted also the perplexed faces of the citizens in front and of those on the platform especially was he aware of blank amaze
the latters eyes were starting from his head and it was evident that his brain was violently dis turbed
guy gave vlandingham a square and manly look
on my honor mr vlandingham said he the man will be at your house when you get there
why gasped barney leveling his finger that there silence roared vlandingham knocking the extended arm downward
you are to go with mr herbert and apprehend this man and take him to my house
not a word from you
if you had been a little later in getting here your in formation would have been valueless
your horse threw you eh
a likely story it looks very much as will have meet you that you though you were late purposely
you something to explain barney when i at my house
for the present show know how to obey orders
go with mr herbert
his friend the enemy barney faced about automatically and started for the door
guy followed at his heels
aside from their echoing footsteps there was not a sound in the room
the captain and mr boomer parted and allowed them to pass mr boomer fingering his revolver nervously
the guard in the passageway eyed them keenly and the man with the rifle at the foot of the stairs suffered them to depart without a word
when they were well on their way to willowview barney found his tongue
well dinged he muttered the spy ainot you the man described in the note answered guy who did not relish the harsher term
at that precise moment he was wishing col keever at the antipodes
his own folly in allow ing the colonel to influence him came in for a large share of his condemnation
better a hun dred times that he lost every cent he had in the world and preserved his selfrespect
he was go ing to meet miss betty now and what would she think of him
why the dickens did the squire act like he did asked the confused barney
he did that to save me from the hands of the harmony people answered guy with a dash of irritation so wrought up over this countyseat matter that they would have acted first and thought about their actions afterwards
you bet they would
a friend in need mr vlandingham is head and shoulders above the rest of them a gentleman ole business thats what you feel pretty meachin my affair youll try to run away now hey
barney caught arm and guy wrenched away and gave his companion a push that almost upset him not going to run away given my word and i shall abide by it
barney whistled
if the people at the meetin had known who you was i guess youd have been carried back to concord feet foremost
guy made no answer to this and they shortly arrived at squire house
their ring was answered by miss betty herself
mr herbert she exclaimed smilingly knew very well that father wouldnot allow you to be hurt
but you took frightful chances
why are you here barney
the squire sent me along to see that he didnot get away responded barney valiantly
well you neednot remain see that he doesnot get away
good night
the door was closed in the astounded face
come into the parlor mr herbert said miss betty
guy couldnot understand the situation at all
his friend the enemy miss betty did not seem to abate one jot or tittle of her friendliness consummate actress guy thought the storm will come before long
miss betty motioned towards a chair
after guy had obediently seated himself she took a rocker visavis
she thought for a moment and then laughed softly
to think she remarked that neither father nor on hearing your name ever thought of connecting you with mr montfort herbert of the concord townsite company and you boarded that freight train at concord too why donot you denounce me for being a spy asked guy impatiently
why should i denounce you
concord is your town mr herbert and it is right for you to do what you can to hold the countyseat
harmony is our town and we shall do what we can to take the countyseat away from you sorry for you for yours is a losing fight
yet there are means you would not counte nance even in a struggle of this kind will have no violence
that is why i added a line to the note which barney brought from concord
that line had escaped guy
he took the note from his pocket and saw penciled dimly at the bottom the words see that no harm comes to mr herbertbetty he drew a deep breath
then i have you to thank for my present safety said he replacing the note in his pocket
a friend in need please donot misunderstand me mr herbert returned miss betty
my fathers ruling passion is real estate
he wanted to sell you some lots in harmony and for fear you wouldnot be where he could watch you he insisted on having you come here
that was also his reason for taking you to the meeting and he had not the slightest notion he was harboring an enemy
miss betty laughed again
at heart she resumed my father is one of the noblest men in the world but i cannot remember that he ever championed a losing cause
whenever he enters a fight he goes in to win
with my aid he is going to be victorious in this countyseat affair
she spoke decisively donot know your real motive for coming here but i presume you wanted to look over the rival town and find out what chance there was for concord retaining its prestige
that was partly it admitted guy
but i also wished to attend the meeting and find out if i could what move your side intended to make
col keever suggested that did he not
it was suggested to me
and you endeavored to follow out this counsel against your better judgment am very sorry now that i acted on the sug gestion at all
you are too much of a gentleman for this sort of work mr herbert
a countyseat contest of this kind is a very disagreeable affair
why should there ever have been a contest
his friend the enemy that was because concord stole the county seat away from harmony in the first place
the vote was close and the canvassing board bought by col keever threw out a sufficient number of harmony votes to give the countyseat to con cord
the blue eyes snapped and the thin nos trils dilated
for this reason the question has been reopened mr herbert and it is for this reason also that i am heart and soul in the conflict
i will have no violence but col keever may have to be met with his own weapons in order that right and justice may prevail
we can be good enemies and good friends as well and after the will try to forget the disagreeable incidents of the campaign
with all my heart declared guy
she offered him her hand and he pressed the little palm cordially
at that moment they heard running feet along the road by the gate angry shouts and now and then the report of a revolver
betty sprang up and hurried to a window a mob in front she said quietly but you need have no fears mr herbert
you are just as safe under this roof as you would be in concord
guy greatly admired her calmness but she un derestimated his courage if she thought for a moment that he was frightened
before he could reply squire vlandingham hurried into the room coming from the rear of the house
a friend in need got a horse at the barn herbert all saddled bridled and waiting said he quickly donot want to alarm you but some of those rascals out there are drunk and barney has told them everything better go i might be powerless to protect you
some one jangled the bell furiously
a scuffling of feet and muttering of hoarse voices came from the porch
there they are said betty
you talk with them at the door father while i show mr her bert where he can find the horse
vlandingham started for the hall but paused to reach out his hand to guy donot believe you knew what kind of a hor nets nest you were going to get into over here herbert got betty on your side i can see that and i donot lay up any hard feelings advise you though to give this burg a wide berth in future
you see i hold the winning cards in this fight and can afford to be magnani mous
guy wrung hand and followed betty outside to a post where a horse was hitched
untying the halter he vaulted into the saddle
betty directed him how to go hope i shall see you again miss vlanding ham he observed
you may see me when you least expect it she answered will send the horse back tomorrow
5o his friend the enemy any time that you find it convenient will be soon enough
remember we are enemies on countyseat matters
and friends on all others
if you wish it do wish it
good bye
she waved her hand and he sped away into the night
guy had a lonely ride back to concord over the broad flat starlit lands
he could see the road dimly a lightish streak cutting the darker turf of the plains
a moist lush smell arose from the dewy grass and the croaking of frogs the chirping of crickets and the resonant boom of the bittern floating from the sedge served only to intensify the stillness
there was far more to this countyseat business than guy had imagined
miss betty felt that harmony had been cheated out of its rights and that was the cause of her inexorable stand in the present contest of the voters in the county had signed the petition for a special elec tion and it was a foregone conclusion that these twothirds would vote for harmony
without doubt this was the premise on which squire vlan dingham and his daughter were building their hopes
their ground was well taken but guy had information relative to col imported voters
he did not know what the voting strength of the county was but he was sure the colonel had been sharp enough to bring in suffi his friend the enemy cient ballots to overcome the twothirds majority
the young man did not fancy this phase of the question although the entire contest was gradu ally presenting itself to him as a case of diamond cut diamond
he had been brought up in abhor rence of ways that are dark and tricks that are vain but now that he was in rome why should he not emulate the romans
to take any other stand was equivalent to bankrupting himself for what chance would concord have if he ordered the imported voters out of the town or per mitted them to exercise the right of franchise un influenced
if ordered away they might flock to harmony in a body and if permitted to vote as they pleased they might be subsidized by agents of vlandingham
the matter was a delicate one and to be handled with extreme caution
the temptation to look out for himself at all costs was a powerful one and had not miss betty her self said that it was right for him to do all he could to keep the countyseat at concord
tak ing everything into consideration guy thought it would be well to lay back on his oars watch the opposition and see what happened
he had a number of thoughts concerning miss betty entirely apart from the political question and in the fairer fields where they were to esteem each other as friends
these were headstrong fancies and so vividly tinted with the hues of youth that they were more properly dreams and not to be chronicled
concord invaded arrived in concord guy left the horse at the livery barn and made his way along the dark and deserted street to the lisbon house
this hotel was under the proprietorship of a portuguese
being unable to pronounce his name the people of concord rose up and bestowed upon him the patronymic of smith
retaining his multitude of christian names his full title thus became pedro fernandez jos manuel smith
this was of course altogether too long for a pioneer community and when pedro fernandez was not plain smith he was pedro or cinch which was practically the same
almost any day pedro might be seen sitting in front of his establishment wearing his white apron and square white cap his legs crossed elbows on his knee complacently swinging his suspended foot and puffing at a corncob pipe
it was thus that guy found the proprietor when he came out from breakfast on the morning after his ride from harmony
the early train from the west had just stopped at the station as guy took a chair on the porch and lighted a cigar
quite an excitement when the trains come in observed pedro
so it seems returned guy looking at the little throng which had gathered on the platform and part of which was visible around the ends of the station building
he saw mr glimmer and lemuel bilkins among others and gave especial his friend the enemy attention to a slender youth whose fiery hair curled fringingly about the edges of his old cap
this latter individual was throwing a canvas bag into the open door of the mail car
sampson ventured pedro noting the direction of gaze
works for the colonel and is just throwing on the eastbound bundle of this weeks blizzard a copy of it if youd like to run it over a mighty warm number countyseat war is gettin interestin
pedro pulled the paper out from under his apron and guy examined it lazily
there was a redhot leader in the scorching style picking the county commissioners to tatters and then hold ing these remnants up to public contumely
the intrinsic value of the article did not interest guy quite so much as something else
he brought out the note which squire vlandingham had handed him at the town meeting the night beforea scrap which he was treasuring simply and solely because of miss penciled message to her father at the bottom of it
turning the note over he perused the writing on the back as he had done once before that morning
the chirography was a blotted scrawl and the ink was purple in color
guy remembered that the ink which the colonel had jarred out of its stand on the preceding afternoon was of that identical hue
yet this was not all
the writing on the back of that note was the counterpart of a frac tion of the leader word for word comma for concord invaded comma and exclamation point for exclamation point
had guy a piece of the copy in his hands
was this a clue to the identity of the broom man mentioned by barney broke from pedro smith as he got up from his chair
here come three passen gers from the west
we donot get many from that direction
guy thrust the note back into his pocket and looked towards the station
the train had gone and the curious citizens were headed back towards the business section of the town
lemuel was carrying the mailsacks for mr a task which he performed proudly and regularly for the mere glory of it sampson a little time at his disposal now that the weeks issue was out of the way had lighted a cigarette and was sauntering leisurely mr glimmer had been expecting his wifes sister from bismarck and it cannot be said that he wore a very disappointed look because she had failed to arrive waffle was of the party and his shadow bill comfort and several more
the attention of the group of citizens was riveted upon the three arrivals who walked in advance and headed for the hotel
two of these were women ostensibly sisters of charity and closely veiled
the third was a man under medium height and enveloped from head to heels in a garment that was much too large for him
his hat was drawn down over his forehead and the collar of his illfitting coat was turned up his friend the enemy about his ears
the attire was exceedingly warm for that season of the year and sampson guyed the stranger in frequent asides to lem bilkins
the sisters of charity passed into the hotel ushered by the obsequious pedro
the little man in the long coat likewise entered the office and took a seat in one corner rigidly erect and not deigning to unbutton his coat
the citizens halted in front of the veranda to stare and specu lateall save bilkins who was due at the post office
cracky exclaimed sampson looking hard at guy
the printer started to say something more but bit his words off short the matter asked guy wondering at the mystified expression of the youths face
oh nothing replied sampson backing away
my dear herbert l cooed the familiar voice of col keever as that gentleman rounded the corner of the hotel and advanced upon guy precipitately
you look well added the colonel significantly dropping a hand on the young mans shoulder
then he stooped and whispered how did you come out
before guy could answer the little man in the illfitting coat plunged out on the veranda and halted at the side
ha cried the little man furiously have come into the jackals lair to pay my respects to the jackalinchief
archibald keever you are an impudent scoundrel sir
you are an illmannered then the blow fell across the concord invaded blackguard sir
you have not the first instincts of a gentleman
you are a coward do you hear me
a coward and a knavel my hat in your teeth sir
the little man jerked off his slouch hat revealing two eyes one of which gleamed glassily at guy while the other traveled up and down the full ex tent of col anatomy then the blow fell across the face
it all came about with paralyzing suddenness
the crowd of concordians stared and gaped as though under some baneful spell
the little man was col dingle of harmony the next instant guy had leaped to his feet
a shudder of mighty passion convulsed col keever
his hand tightened convulsively on the head of his cane
sir he shouted is it your intention to apply to me those hurtling epithets
come to think of it afterwards there was little use of the question but great minds often wish to be absolutely certain of both horns of a proposition before tackling the conclusion
the little man laughed mockingly have coupled the word with a blow he cried
in order that you may satisfy yourself i have made no mistake i will strike again so the norther greets the blizzard
again came that swishing blow with the hat and col keever dazed for the moment fanned imaginary flies from before his face
his friend the enemy dingle gasped col keever hoarsely
hold me somebody hold me or i shall kill him l mr glimmer hurled himself into the breach and caught keever about the waist while pedro smith dashed out of the hotel and threw himself upon dingle
then struggling ineffectually to free themselves the two colonels glared at each other
you are a sneak sir and a coward sir screamed the editor of the norther
hold me tight glimmer hissed the editor of the blizzard through his grinding teeth am not myself
righteous wrath is making a demon of me if i were to swoop down on that mis guided man nothing would be left to tell the tale
let him go cried dingle frantically dare you to let him go harmony man howled the citizens push ing angrily forward and surrounding the diminu tive person with the glass eye
he must be a spy l roared a voice
string him up echoed another
lynch him lynch him lynch him swelled the chorus
stand back shouted guy shouldering his way to side
get a ropel fumed the crowd
next to vlandingham hes the worst enemy this town has got make an example of him guy halted in front of dingle and kept the crush back with his strong arms
concord invaded we must get him out of here pedro said guy breathlessly
if we donot some of these hot heads will get us all into trouble
where can we take him got a room upstairs that we can lock him in replied pedro and the people catching the last words voiced the fierce demand lock him up put him under lock and key until we decide what to do with him want to help you dingle said guy in the little mans ear be foolishgo with us and well do what we can for you
dingle was sullenly defiant but he yielded to guy and pedro and accompanied them into the hotel and up the broad stairs leading to the second floor the crowd pushing and plunging after them
rumors of the excitement had spread to the four quarters of the town and citizens came run ning from every direction adding their numbers and their excitement to the tumultuous gathering in the hotel
give the man a show cried christopher waffle shrilly springing upon a chair in the office act like a lot of hyenas law in this town and waffle knows how to deal it out down with old waffle bellowed the crowd take the law into our own hands the mob swarmed about chair over turned it and the judge went down and was lost in the human wave that rolled over him
his friend the enemy 6o meantime guy and pedro had been doing yeo man service in behalf of the headstrong dingle
the little man had been crowded into a fiveby seven linen closet off the upper hall and the door locked on him
guy the key in his hand turned away and confronted the clamoring multitude that struggled up the stairs
you are men not brutes he shouted civil ized citizens and not a barbarian horde l he had used that speech once in his callow youth for a school declamation and he poured forth that much of it with all his power
it sounded well caught the ears of the unruly townspeople and proved the entering wedge for a little reason
look
guy waved the key
we have locked col dingle in a closet and if you will appoint someone to guard him some one whom you can all trust we will proceed to debate this question and decide as dispassionately as we can what shall be done with our prisoner be like ravening of the prove that you are reasonable beings
let us go down into the office and reason together
herbert has got the right end of the stick seconded judge waffle lifting up his voice from the top of the office counter
do as he says and lets have a concensus of opinion
that is my wish shouted col keever from the foot of the stairs
come down fellow citi zens come down and we will talk the matter over
concord invaded to have their leader add his personal request settled the matter and the riotous citizens on the stairs began to descend
who shall guard the prisoner asked guy
mr pedro smith no thundered keever let sampson stand in the hall before the door
sampson pushed up the stairs with alacrity took the key from hand and proceeded at once to his post
when all the others were on the office floor a debate as to the punishment which should be meted out to col dingle was at once begun
a few suggested hanging in no equivocal terms a large number were of the opinion that tarring and feathering was as far as they should go while a conservative element believed that col dingle would suffer sufficient punishment if he were set astride a pole and ridden out of town
there was but one point on which the agreement was anything like being unanimous and that was that dingle before he was dealt with in any manner whatever should go down on his knees to col keever and implore his pardon
guy was against this and so was waffle and of course bill comfort
arguments pro and con came fast and furious and an hour passed with out bringing the dissenting factions any closer together than they were at first
misunderstand ings began to crop out and more than one harsh word was bandied back and forth
his friend the enemy just when it seemed that the wrangling citizens would come to blows a despairing cry for help floated down from upstairs
it was voice what had happened
in a flash every voice was hushed and the crowd caught its breath
then came the slamming of a door followed by a crashing sound and a hollow groan
guy led the rush for the second story and found when he reached the top of the stairs that the closet door was ajar the prisoner gone and sampson lying in a huddled heap on the floor without sound or movement
the astounded citizens looked from one to an other and as they looked the swift fall of a horses hoofs echoed up from the street accom panied by a shrill and triumphant yell
with one accord the crowd flocked to the windows and caught a fleeting glimpse of col dingle careering madly in the direction of harmony
he was mounted on the horse which guy had ridden the night before and was waving over his head the weathervane that had been recently affixed to the roof of the new courthouse
the citizens of concord were stupefied
that weathervane was a symbol of their defiance of the other town and to have the hated dingle come brazenly among them insult their leader in a peculiarly irritating manner escape mysteriously while they were wrangling over the method of his punishment and flee with that grotesque gal vanized iron figure waving over his head was enough to paralyze the most rabid partisan
christopher waffle was a concord man to the marrow of his bones but he had no love for col because the colonel had once overcharged him for a threshing ad
nor had waffle admired the handiwork as exem plified in the weathervane
the judge had said that it was coarse and brutally insolent and that something would happen on account of it for which they would all be sorry
in the present crisis the judge was first to find his voice and he cried in tones vibrant with a certain kind of triumph told you so his friend the enemy what waff said all along supple mented bill comfort
the swarm turned upon the judge wrathfully and col keever shouted and do you sir do you mean to champion the cause of this contemptible sneak from the other side of the county
no never but dingle has done this town a service by making off with that monstrosity
what gasped the crowd glaring at waffle
bill comfort planted himself at the side and defiantly reiterated the statement
col keever was red and wrathful
a clash was impending and guy pushed his way between the opposing factions
enough of this said he
we have a power ful enemy in vlandingham and we cannot hope to win unless we present an undivided front
instead of contending among ourselves suppose we inquire into the method of col escape
and are forgetting about him
he may be severely hurt
this was sufficient to turn the attention of the crowd into another channel and guy led the back ward movement along the hall to the spot where the unfortunate printer was lying
sampson had not moved a hairs breadth
he was flat on his back his arms and legs sprawled out and his eyes closed
there were no visible marks of injury upon his face and guy dropped down on one knee and lifted his head
the sisters of charity as he did this guy saw a section of glittering gold chain on the floor under the printer and he dropped one hand over it and concealed it in his palm
no one else had glimpsed the bit of jewelry and heart was in his throat the instant his eyes fell on it
at a favorable moment he trans ferred the chain to his pocket and continued his examination of sampson
stand back l commanded the colonel him air get some water somebody give gentle men gentlemen that boy has been the trial of my life but if he has been sacrificed by the venomous dingle call the murderer out by gad face him with a sixshooter and my word for it hell be carried from the field
that awful threat silenced the bystanders and forced them back but guy saw waffle nudge his engineer and whisper something that made them both grin sarcastically not have to call dingle out colonel said guy pulse is normal his heart strong and i canot find a wound on him
pedro arrived just then with a glass of ice water
in his excitement he dashed the whole of it in the printers face
the effect was instantane ous and sampson sat up rolling his eyes and spluttering
who did that were his first words
sampson said the colonel tenderly do you know me
look boy
i know you
who hit me with that his friend the enemy bucket of water thats what i want to find out
nice way to treat a man when hes down sampson got up energetically and looked about him with indignant eyes
there there samp said the colonel sooth ingly
you were knocked down by that brute of a dingle you remember
oh yes returned sampson peering at the open door of the closet and rubbing his forehead in a bewildered way
did he escape should say he did sampson
how did it happen
tell us about it
well replied sampson heard him hunting around in that closet and i opened the door to see what he was up to
after that theres a blank kind of mixed up with shooting stars comets and other bright things
where did he hit you inquired guy
give it up
that is exactly what guy did
either the printer had had a timely attack of heart failure or else he was shamming this asked comfort who had wan dered into the closet and was now standing with his eyes fixed on the door
the next moment he stepped backinto the hall pulled the door shut and all could see that there was a letter fastened to one of the panels with a pin
the crowd surged for ward eagerly that archconspirator keever with the compliments of col dingle read mr glimmer the sisters of charity as he jerked the note from the door and handed it to the colonel
read it colonel chorused the crowd palpi tating with curiosity
the colonel tore off the end of the envelope and drew out the enclosed sheet
his eyes flashed fire as he swept them over the few lines the note con tained his face became convulsed with passion and his breast shook with his labored breathing
read it read it clamored the bystanders
no roared the colonel
this is for me alone for me
i have borne with this contempt ible cur beyond endurance
the villain the ras cal let him look to himself now if he can
the colonel spun about on his heel and made off ragefully as fast as he was able
sampson shot after him and then the crowd disintegrated by twos and threes and drifted in the direction of the postoffice discussing the exciting events of the morning and asking each other what that note could possibly have contained to set the colonel off at such a tangent
a favorable moment presenting itself guy drew pedro into the parlor on the second floor
those two sisters of charity are staying in this hotel arenot they mr smith asked the young man
yes replied pedro
where did they come from
do you know donot know a thing about them
they havenot spoken half a dozen words to me
his friend the enemy have you made any guess as to what they are here for
some charity or other i suppose
please ask them to come to this parlor
tell them that a gentleman who is charitably disposed would like a short interview with them eyes opened wide as he went away to carry out request
presently there was a rustle of garments along the hall and the two ladies still deeply veiled entered the parlor
guy bowed
they acknowledged the greeting with a slight courtesy
pedro was standing in the door will join you in the office in a few moments mr smith said guy significantly and pedro went away disappointedly
the young man waited until he heard the proprie tors footsteps descend the length of the stairs and then he advanced to one of the ladies and handed her the chain which he had found a short time before
you must have the clasp repaired miss vlan dingham he said in a low tone
both ladies started back instinctively and then a low laugh came from miss betty as she switched her veil aside and revealed her smiling face
you are very kind mr herbert said she taking the bracelet
she turned to her companion
lois this is the gentleman of whom i was telling you
we are discovered you see in spite of all our precautions and that proves that the best laid plans of mice and maids gang aft agley
mr herbert miss pinkney
the sisters of charity miss pinkney was reassured by her companions confident manner and likewise dropped her veil
she was a darkly beautiful girl and although she seemed a trifle frightened her gaze was steady and her lips were rigidly firm
she bowed formally
miss pinkney resumed miss betty is a very dear friend of mine and quite as determined to assist in winning the countyseat as i am
you have both been very reckless said guy gravely
the citizens of concord are exceedingly wrought up over the events of the morning and i tremble to think of your position if you chanced to be discovered
we shall not be discovered answered miss betty pertly
that is not unless you see fit to reveal our identity
you know i would not do that retorted guy indignantly
but we are here in the interests of harmony you know have no doubt of it
it would be to your interest to have us appre hended andand made prisoners
miss lois paled and flashed a startled glance at her companion would rather have concord lose the county seat said guy
miss betty fixed her melting blue eyes upon him for a space
concord will be ruined when harmony gets the countyseat she went on suppose how 7o his friend the enemy ever that you are very wealthy and would con sider as a mere bagatelle the depreciation in value of a thousand or more lots
guy started to tell her that he had hardly a dollar that he could call his own outside of the town but he bit his lip and kept the words back
miss vlandingham he said instead you and miss pinkney must return at once to mony
har i will get a conveyance and drive you back
not for worlds would i allow you to do that if the concord people ever found out what you had done they would turn against you chance it
perhaps you would but we wonot
miss betty tossed her head
guy was desperate
really miss vlandingham he said earnestly must insist that you let me drive you back to harmony
really exclaimed miss betty laughing at him with her eyes
well sir we insist on staying here until we accomplish the work that brought us
you will not deport us against our will
you are a pair of madcaps averred guy helplessly
if you came over here to assist col dingle we did not come for that she interrupted hastily am sorry you have such a poor opinion of us as to think we would bear a hand in such a matter
had i been informed of col
the sisters of charity purpose he would never have come here this morning
yet i found your bracelet close to the room from which col dingle escaped
we are quartered across the hall
after col dingle got into such a predicament we could do no less than help him out of it
while you and your fellow townsmen were wrangling in the office i left by a rear stairway and a rear door and had the liveryman saddle and make ready the horse you rode over from harmony last night
the animal was hitched near the building you propose to use for a courthouse
when col dingle es caped from the room the coast was comparatively clear as nearly all the citizens were at the hotel
for that reason he had no difficulty in getting away
in my haste i lost my bracelet and did not discover that it was gone until the angry mob came flocking up the stairs
then of course it was too late to recover it
i am very much obliged to you mr herbert for proceeding so secretly in the matter
you had seen that bracelet before and you knew who the owner of it must be so you had only to raise your voice and direct the whole pack against us grateful arenot we lois
very said miss pinkney in a constrained voice
you are under no obligation to me returned guy
the account is more than balanced by your kindness of last night miss vlandingham
his friend the enemy at this juncture guy heard some one coming up the stairs three steps at a time
quick he murmured replace your veils
miss hands trembled as she once more folded the gray covering across her face
but there was no trace of alarm in the actions of miss betty
she was as cool and selfpossessed as though presiding at some social function in her own town of harmony
barely were the fair faces covered when samp son burst into the parlor
he stopped short on beholding the ladies and evinced some confusion
what do you want sampson asked guy
the colonel wants to see you mr herbert and in a tearing hurry
guy turned to give a parting salute to the ladies but miss betty extended her hand
as he took the little palm in his she whispered as a friend i thank you from the bottom of my heart mr herbert but as an defy you do not be too sentimental nor overchival rous
remember that i am here in the interests of harmony and that it is your duty to look out for concord
with that she turned away and guy followed sampson out of the room
col keever was tremendously wrought up
he was pacing the restricted limits of his office and tossing his arms and talking to himself so wrath fully oblivious of his surroundings that he did not notice the entrance of guy and sampson for several moments
occasionally the colonel would halt glower at a copy hook fastened to the wall shake his fist at it and address it by such terms as infernal scoundrel contemptible cur and so on
fi nally he jerked the hook from the wall cast it on the floor and set his heel on the sheets that were strung upon it
great guns colonel cried sampson spoilin about a dozen stickfuls of copy
oh is it you sampson said the colonel whirling
mr herbert i want a word with you sir
he picked up the hook with its attached sheets and handed it to the printer
go out and get to work on that he said shortly
sampson vanished into the workroom forthwith
how long have you been in this office mr herbert asked the colonel
his friend the enemy about two minutes replied guy
then you witnessed my ebullition of wrath sir and i beg your pardon
ah but i have a devil of a temper i would fight at the drop of a hatpossibly sir i would jar the hand that held the hat my southern breeding i suppose my southern breeding backed by long years of slaughter in our late war
i am trying to out grow my temper but success comes very slowly
some ancient philosopher said that every man has a wolf imprisoned in his breast
i believe that herbert and i am trying to strangle my own particular wolf
it was the wolf that hurled scorching words at that copy hook and tore it from the wall sir not no not keever
but and the colonel brought his right fist down in his left wolf is going to have the upper hand until i square accounts with this man dingle wouldnot do anything rash colonel ven tured guy
rash
gad what would you do if a man struck you twice across the face with his hat
knock him down said guy promptly and thats what any man with an ordinary temper would do
but that would only be a halfway measure with me
i presume you noticed that i did not knock dingle down did was the dry response restrained myself held myself in check in col flash in the pan order that i might take a more terrible vengeance
herbert i am going to have life l you certainly are not there there try to argue with me for it is useless utterly useless
i have made up my mind
let me assure you that i am no stranger to the field of honor
at one time sir the code duello was my vade mecum
i counted that day lost herbert which passed without my calling some one out
the colonel pulled the brim of his white top hat firmly down over his brow
in his estimation a stiff white hat was the acme of gentility the crown and symbol of a gentleman
a stiff white hat moreover throws about its wearer a political glamour which was something not to be ignored by the editor of that justly celebrated sheet the concord blizzard
the colonel not only pulled down the brim of his hat but he buttoned the two lower buttons of his frock coat across his capacious stomach rested one elbow on the top of his desk and swung his caneswung it slowly and relentlessly
his manner plainly stating that threats prayers and entreaties would alike be powerless to swerve him guy thought best not to make another attempt
in a little while the colonel ceased swinging his cane long enough to indicate with the point of it a letter which lay open on the top of his desk
read that herbert he said by gad you read that
his friend the enemy guy cast his eyes down and read the following archibald keever colonel socalled
sir i have been appointed a committee of one to rid this territory of your baneful presence
you have cumbered the earth too long and i shall be pleased to offer you a proof of my distinguished regard with a sixshooter at twenty paces time and place to be designated by you
my only stipulation is that the place selected be equi distant from concord and harmony
reply by post
if you do not meet me i shall make it my pleasant duty publicly to chastise you and de nounce you as the arrant braggart that you are
that certainly has a businesslike sound commented guy
the colonel laughed tragically socalled he sneered
by gad i didnot have to move west like dingle to get a title
i won it on the field of battle sir spilling my blood for my country
he asks for an affec tionate exchange of powder and ball and i shall give him a heartfelt token of my esteem at the distance specified
herbert i want you for my second
guy shook his head
the cane stopped swinging with a jerk and a hard hard look came into the eyes
do i understand you to say sir that you will not accommodate me donot believe in duels colonel
nature has endowed every gentleman with a pair of fists
if col flash in the pan these weapons are powerless to protect his honor his honor is hardly worth bothering about
the pith of this remark escaped the colonel entirely am not only protecting my own honor her bert he said coldly but the honor of our town as well
your lots share in the gen eral ignominy and it is your duty to stand by me in this little affair
do i still understand you to say that you wonot
you do
i want a fair and square fight for the countyseat and i donot approve of any coarse or gratuitous flings like that of the weathervane
claptrap of that kind merely intensifies the hos tile feeling which is already too bitter and venge ful
it is only a step from our present situation to warfare and bloodshed
i was in grave peril last night was going to ask you about that broke in the colonel curiosity for the moment overcoming his resentment
you succeeded in getting in
yes and i succeeded in getting out again and saving myself a rough experience only through the magnanimity of squire vlandingham
vlandingham is a knave sir
squire vlandingham is a gentleman col keever he couldnot come of the stock he does and be a gentleman
rot exclaimed guy disgustedly
we wonot quarrel herbert it wonot do for us his friend the enemy to quarrel meeting
did you discover anything at the nothing of any consequence
at that moment the office door opened and a man who looked like a day laborer came into the room
he had a shifty eye an unrazored face and wore a red and sweatstained shirt
his hands were big and seamed with toil
who are you sir demanded the colonel
my names hepburn replied the man rolling his eyes from the colonel to guy and then about the room
up to yesterday i was workin on the section at harmony
but i got fired yesterday mornin
ah ha returned the colonel blinking
here was a deserter from the enemy a man with a grievance
what do you want mr hepburn suppose i can talk before him all right answered hepburn nodding his head in direction
he was the chap that got out of harmony last night by the skin of his teeth
certainly you can talk before him said the colonel
is there any one else to hear us gaze continued to travel around the sanctum and his face became anxious
9y no one else to hear us answered the colonel impatiently
proceed sir proceed
well then i want to sell some information
what is it about queried the colonel warily
col flash in the pan about harmony
what is it worth worth hundreds to you mebby thousands and mebby it means the donot know
i want for the information
got to have money to get to jimtown never goin back to harmony no more
the colonel laid his cane on the top of his desk removed his hat and placed it carefully beside the cane and then began to rub his hands
what do you say asked hepburn
the colonel looked toward guy as though ex pecting him to foot the bill say no said guy donot want your information mr hepburn and decline to hand over the price of your treachery
hepburn appeared startled and the jaw dropped spasmodically
are you mad spluttered keever
let me tell you sir that if you try to run this county seat fight according to any notions well be beaten hands down
all right returned guy cheerfully not all right sir cried the colonel
you with your lots are not the only man interested
there are others
in behalf of the drew a bill from his pocket and handed it to shall pay mr hepburn the price of his treachery if you please
then look to it that the money doesnot come out of the townsite fund warned guy
8o his friend the enemy col keever held his head very high and refused to take any notice of these words
go on said he to hepburn
well said hepburn casting a nervous glance at guy one of hired men is a friend of mine and he told me what i am goin to tell you
blue has formed a company of twenty men which he calls the harmony invinci bles drillin nearly all the time
is that all only half
the other half is the biggest part of the news
there are two spies in this town
they are at the hotel now disguised as sisters of charity
one of them is daughter an tother one is a miss pinkney
a cold chill swept along nerves
had he known what was coming he would have reached out and choked the section man into silence
the colonel let off a roar of delight and grabbed up his hat and cane
are you done hepburn he cried that enough asked the informer wick edly his hand on the doorknob do itll do
mind you keep this to your self man hang me if i ever went back to har mony and they found it out
hepburn departed and the colonel turned to guy
young man said he severely your notions of right and wrong are exaggerated and out of place
but for me those two items of information col flash in the pan would never have been delivered daughter here at our mercy
gad think of that l the colonel started for the door and guy stepped quickly in front of him
what do you intend to do about it asked guy quietly
do blustered the colonel
why going to have pettibone the sheriff arrest em both hold em as hostages
vlandingham will have to bargain with us for their release by gad make it cost him the countyseat do nothing of the kind said guy a glint of steel coming into his eyes this cried the colonel
by the eternal it looks as though you are playing into the hands of the enemy and that we have three traitors in camp instead of two immaterial how it looks to you
i will deal with these ladies at the hotel
no by gad
stand aside stand aside i say or brain you
the colonel caught his cane by the lower end and flourished the heavy handle above head
quick as a flash the young man caught the stick jerked it from the grasp and flung it into a corner then he grabbed the colonel by both shoulders and pinned him against the par tition
attempt to arrest those young ladies or say a word about their being in this town he mut his friend the enemy tered fiercely and see that you have cause to regret it take care of them
after giving the colonel a final bump against the partition guy released him and dashed from the office
a it was about oclock when guy left the office
he did not go to the hotel im mediately but hastened first across the street to the livery stable
a big strapping fellow came out and advanced toward him from the shadowy regions between the stalls
guy was surprised for in spite of the big fellows turnedup coat collar and continued attempts to keep his face averted he recognized him as barney
guy had not much time to waste in useless ex pressions of astonishment or in any other ex tended chain of thought
he immediately con nected barney with that note of which he had been the bearer and which was written on the back of a sheet of newspaper copy
the next instant he recalled words about inability to read writing
if this were true barney certainly could not have been the author of the note
possibly there were four spies in camp instead of two
was the fourth man sampson
well barney said guy cynically we meet again
his friend the enemy got the best o me answered barney staring blankly at guy try to play the innocent went on guy drawing closer to the stableman and speaking in a low and hurried tone know youre a har mony man but i give you my word that i wonot say anything about it providing you stop your spying operations from this time on
just now i want you to help me
miss vlandingham and miss pinkney are here in town disguised as sisters of charity
col keever has found it out and i want to get them started back to harmony before any harm befalls them
put your best team to a doubleseated carriage in the shortest possible order and drive to the hotel
without another word guy left the stable and hastened to the hotel office
as he passed the emporium he caught a glimpse of col keever standing inside in close and animated con versation with mr glimmer and several others
the young man had little doubt that keever was retailing the information obtained from hepburn
there was not an instant to be lost if miss vlandingham and miss pinkney were to be saved from the consequences of their rash on reaching the hotel guy found the office empty but quickly discovered the proprietor smoking his pipe on the veranda must have a word with those sisters of charity at once mr smith said guy
a narrow escape pedro took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at guy wonderingly
it isnot possible mr herbert said he
why not
quick in a tearing hurry not here thats why
they went out half an hour since
where did they go tell you
guy ran out through the rear of the building
he was about to wheel sharply into the main street when he saw an excited throng making in that direction the colonel at their head
facing about he hurried along under the shelter of a barn and some sheds thereby avoiding the crowd which was just entering the hotel as he came out on the street again
what could he do
he was perplexed and had an uncomfortable feeling of helplessness
sud denly he saw barney drive a team and carriage out of the barn
the vehicle was a covered sur rey and barney had a shotgun lying beside him on the front seat mined
his face was set and deter loyal to vlandingham was men tal comment glad of that for i can count on him to do his utmost ladies
but where are the what has become of them
as he asked himself this question he saw barney draw his mettlesome horses down to a slower pace swerve sharply to the right and come to an abrupt halt in front of the new courthouse
his friend the enemy there were no workmen engaged on the building the force employed there having been sent into the country to assist in repairing some roads
rais ing his whip barney motioned with it and guy was quickly at his side in there said barney nodding his head towards the courthouse
guy stepped into the building
miss pinkney white as death was leaning against one of the unfinished walls
at sight of guy an expression of horror crossed her face
miss betty was standing a little distance away jotting something down in a notebook
a tape line was looped over the gloved fingers of her left hand
told of us did you she observed icily without looking up
guy went hot and cold in a breath
told of you he echoed
yes said miss betty still writing
some of your worthy townspeople are in pursuit of us
they came out of a store down the street and bolted past shouting all sorts of direful threats against old daughter
i am al most sorry i helped you out of your dilemma last night mr herbert
but for my meddling you would not have been here to betray our identity
she closed the notebook with a curt little snap laid the pencil on its cover and wrapped the tape line around and around do not care for my self particularly as i know your fellowcitizens would not dare to do anything very desperate
a narrow escape but miss pinkney is not made of such stern stuff as i am
it was very unkind and ungrateful of you mr herbert face had become almost as white as miss do you think for a moment he gasped that i would do such a dastardly thing
who else could have done it
she looked at him hopefully asking with her eyes as plainly as eyes could ask anything that he lift himself from the depth to which he had fallen in her estimation
she seemed to have no regard for the peril of her position appearing to desire only an explana tion and half fearing he could not give it
it was done by some one else said guy in desperate earnest
take my word for it
an explanation would consume too much time and endanger your chances of escape
i have had that carriage made ready for you
please get into it at once without a moments delay
as soon as those men find you are not at the hotel they will go elsewhere to look for you
who is the driver of the carriage asked miss betty able to see only one side of the vehicle through the narrow door
barney said guy a man whom you can trust implicitly
lois said miss betty get into the carriage
i think we are mistaken about mr herbert
anyway i shall stay here long enough to make sure
his friend the enemy miss pinkney left hurriedly and miss betty again turned to guy
it is too bad that the high opinions we some times form of people on first acquaintance should be overthrown said she and i was very much disappointed when forced to the conclusion that you had told of our presence here
now tell me truly mr herbert is not this a little plan of yours to get us to leave concord without ac complishing the work that brought us here
great heavens no cried guy
it would have been a very clever plan she went on demurely
have a carriage ready you know tell the populace send them rushing away on a wrong scent and thus make us glad of the opportunity to avail ourselves of the carriage which we refused this morning
as a ruse it would have been wait any longer implored guy fancy i can hear your pursuers coming
she bent her head listeningly
no not yet she answered lightly
who was it told of us man who will never again go back to har mony
his name was hepburn and he worked on the railroad in your town but was discharged yesterday
i refused to purchase his information but col keever paid for it and i heard what he had to say
i have done what i could for you miss vlandingham know it mr herbert and in order that your a narrow escape work may not have been done in vain i am go ing
i have performed the mission that brought me here so look out for a master stroke on the part of harmony
she flashed a bright smile at him and was out of the building and into the carriage before he could reach her side and give her any assistance
barney used his whip and just as his team started along the street towards the railroad track col keever and his followers broke from the hotel and raced back in the direction of the blizzard office
guy halted stock still and held his breath
the carriage was upon the men and almost past them before any attention was paid to it
it was the fortune to catch first sight of the ladies who were leaning back on the rear seat in the shelter of the side curtains
there they are cried keever team stop that catch the horses heads but barney plied the lash vigorously and before the companions were able to act on his warning the carriage was beyond them all and whirling its passengers rapidly away
the road to harmony led past the depot across the railroad tracks and then bore off to the left
with a fresh team and a good start there is no doubt that barney would have distanced his pur suers had not the road been unexpectedly blocked
the noon train suddenly drew up to the depot platform
it was a long train and so completely 9o his friend the enemy obstructed the way that there was no getting around it without turning squarely about and retracing the street for a full block
such a move would have been disastrous for the pursuers were not more than a hundred yards behind
a yell of triumph went up from the throats of col keever and his men
guy started at a run for the scene
before he came anywhere near the carriage however he saw miss vlandingham and miss pinkney descend from it and hurry to the train
a brakeman helped them up the steps of the nearest car signalled go ahead to the conductor and the latter gave the word to the engineer
but already col keever panting like a por poise had clutched the iron handrail
close be hind him was dick pettibone the sheriff
hold this train l bellowed the colonel
get off there shouted barney pressing the lines between his knees and flinging the shotgun to his shoulder
drop off that train col keever or the train had begun to move
pettibone had not been able to get aboard but the colonel had and was standing on the lower step
he looked around at command and the sight of the gun staggered him shoot donot shoot he cried frantically and sprang to the ground lost his footing fell flat and rolled over and over in the dust of the road sho ll or keever col train that off drop guy had come up with the baffled crowd just in time to witness the discomfiture
he experienced a sense of great relief at the escape of miss betty and her friend and kept himself as much in the background as possible when the irate citizens rushed forward and assisted petti bone to set their leader upright and dust him off have the law on you sir raged the colonel breaking through the crowd that sur rounded him and shaking his fist at barney
threaten me hey
egad it makes my blood l get excited colonel shouted barney from the carriage
excited you impudent puppy
excited pet tibone arrest that man surprised that you stand there without raising a finger against the young scalawag
the town had only one fault to find with dick pettibone and that was that he was too easy going too good natured
there were spartan fibres running through his makeup but they were in evidence only on extreme occasions
oh i wouldnot make him any trouble col his friend the enemy onel returned pettibone soothingly young you know and all young men are more or less headstrong a traitor fumed the colonel
if it hadnot been for him daughter wouldnot have slipped through our fingers think she would colonel
no sir raved the colonel
arrest that young rapscallion or chastise him here and now
the colonel began to roll up his coat sleeves and barney coolly eyeing him made a wry grim ace
laying the shotgun down on the seat barney attempted to turn the carriage and drive off
by this time however the words had had an effect on his followers and two of them caught the horses heads
pettibone seeing that there was nothing for him to do but to act in his official capacity ordered barney to get down
barney obeyed without any show of resistance and pettibone marched off with him while mr glimmer took the team and carriage back to the livery stable
during all this time guy had been overlooked
he remained in the vicinity long enough to note the outcome of the exciting little drama and then slipped quietly away to the hotel
he was there an hour later deeply engaged in a st paul paper when a nervous little gentleman wearing a pair of nose glasses was led up to him by pedro smith
the key to the situation mr herbert said pedro mr pinchbeck
mr pinchbeck has recently interested himself in our little city and he wishes to talk with you concerning the outlook
guy shook hands with mr pinchbeck and the latter seated himself at the young mans side while pedro drifted away towards the kitchen understand that you own nearly all the vacant lots in this town mr herbert observed mr pinchbeck catching his glasses as they dropped from his nose
guy nodded
have you bought here recently he asked
quite recently
very much blockconditionally
mr pinchbeck caught his glasses again fitted them carefully to the bridge of his nose and wrinkled his brows a time or two to satisfy himself that they would hold am to pay for the block provid ing this town wins the countyseat fight
ah i see
your money is to be paid back if we lose hasnot really been paid over as yet
i have merely a contract for a deed this way mr herbert
when the ballots are counted if they show a good safe majority for concord i am to pay to the workmen who have been brought here to build roads bridges etc and i am also to pay for that wooden shell which is ultimately to be the courthouse
his friend the enemy this was a revelation to guy
here was the tenderfoot about whom the colonel had told him
the colonel however had said nothing of a conditional bargain
in case we lose the countyseat mr pinch beck said guy what would happen
mr pinchbeck smiled
the mirthful wrinkles disconnected his glasses and they evaded his hand and dropped into his lap
the smile faded into a look of vexation as he picked up the glasses and jammed them back on the bridge of his nose all right mr herbert
i have a con tract with vlandingham for a block at the same figure in case his town wins
guy was startled
has mr vlandingham also imported some voters he asked donot know as i ought to say so but he has run in a lot of fellows from bismarck the same number that keever has brought in from jimtown working somewhere around harmony and will be in evidence on elec tion day
in se harmony wins you are going to pay workmen
is that it it
col keever said you were a tenderfoot mr pinchbeck but you certainly do not act like one
no matter from which direction the breeze comes you have an anchor to windward just plain business thats all returned the key to the situation mr pinchbeck dashing his hand to his face barely in time to keep his glasses there
is squire vlandingham also building a court house
i drove over from harmony this morning and saw vlandingham before i started got something up his sleeve
i hardly know what though
he told me that fools build court houses and wise men occupy them
i donot know as i ought to tell you this being a noncom batant as you might say but i guess it wonot do any harm
vlandingham is a deep one but his daughter is deeper still
what do you know about miss vlandingham asked guy with sudden interest
mr pinchbeck started to answer but had to pause to grab his glasses again
why donot you get a cord added guy somewhat testily
eh 9y tie em on continued guy pointing to the glasses
if they were mine theyd give me ner vous prostration
i donot know but they will anyhow get so mad sometimes admitted mr pinch beck that i feel as though i could swear
he put the glasses in his pocket
nearsighted you know and canot tell a dog from a wildcat across the street was asking what you know about miss vlandingham said guy
so you were
miss vlandingham mr herbert his friend the enemy is one of the cleverest young women i have ever seen
her mind is by far the brightest of any in the rival town give you the fight of your life and inclined to think that her town will win a girl of infinite resource and that episode of this morning clearly illustrates the spectacular way she has of doing things
gra cious think of a woman donning a disguise and coming deliberately into a hotbed of partisanship like this mr pinchbeck seemed so overcome by the thought that he found it impossible to con tinue for several moments
you are a young man without much experience mr herbert he said finally and like to give you a word of advice
will you accept it in a kindly spirit
certainly mr pinchbeck
what have you to offer
amityville is the key to this countyseat situa tion
one lot of imported voters will offset the other and as amityville goes so goes the election
do you catch on think i do
personally i have little choice between con cord and harmony
still my profits if this town is victorious will be slightly greater as the blocks are four lots larger
hence this tip mr herbert
get a county map and study it
mr pinchbeck got up walked over to the cigar case and took out a cigar laying a nickel in the box for such purpose made and provided
the principle of gain was too firmly wrought the key to the situation into mr nature for guy to estimate him very highly as a man but he had furnished the youth with a good deal of mental pabulum
every makeshift and design in the rival town appeared to cluster about the personality of miss bettymiss betty with her titian hair and melt ing eyesas dauntless as she was charming as brave as she was resourceful
she had met col most diplomatic move bringing in voters from bismarck to offset those from jamestown
the contest was assuming proportions which made guy extremely doubtful of the result
miss betty was likely to win the countyseat away from him and his heart along with it
after an hour of fruitless reflection guy borrowed a county map of pedro fortified himself with a good cigar and went up to his room to consider the question of amityville
this village was the only other town in goodwill county
a marginal note on the map informed guy that its population was only about thirty five
these thirtyfive were undoubtedly favorable to harmony for amityville lay to the west of that town and consequently nearer to it than to concord
in order for harmony to present a peti tion containing the names of twothirds of the qualified voters in the county amityville must have signed it to a man
here was a good field for effort guy thought
why could he not go over there and talk to the people
he came to a conclusion just as the supper bell rang
he was his friend the enemy thoroughly determined to go to amityville in the course of a few days and try his hand at elec tioneering
when he came out of his room he saw pettibone sitting in the hall beside his door
the young man was surprised at the sheriffs presence but made no comment
what did you do with barney mr petti bone asked guy confined in a room over that we use as a jail to be done with him
judge waffle will have to decide that
pettibone was most companionable
he not only accompanied guy downstairs but sat at table with him during supper followed him out on the porch for an evening smoke chatted with him until bedtime and then accompanied him up stairs again to his room
a cot was standing in the hall beside door in place of the chair
see here pettibone said guy a nice fellow and all that but donot you think youre crowding me pretty close
well no answered pettibone after a brief period of thought
what does this mean any way
the colonel and a lot more didnot like the way you carried on this morning and they wanted me to lock you up along with barney
but i told em no
then they insisted that i should have to watch you and be responsible for you if the key to the situation i didnot put you under lock and key
i says all right and thats why here a good feller as youve just been kind enough to say and dead sure youre another so were going to get along without any friction ainot we try to laughed guy
and in the morning continued pettibone go to the circus
circus echoed guy
what circus petti bone
well the case of keever vs liscomb is going to be tried before judge waffle and if we donot have a show with all but the rings and the canvas miss my guess
guy bade the sheriff goodnight and went into the room and closed the door
the people of his own town had turned against him the matter was becoming interesting and the interest was likely to increase instead diminish of on the following morning shortly before the judicial hour of ten guy and pettibone proceeded to the building containing the drug store and ascended to the second story
here was the court room and likewise the small apartment utilized as a jail
unlocking the door of the latter chamber pettibone requested barney to come forth
the prisoner obeyed and when he saw guy he pressed close to him and asked in a low tone while the sheriff busied himself relocking the door did you give me away
no replied guy and i will not
if you can get clear barney go back to harmony and stay there
that will be the safest and best thing you can do
barney nodded as the sheriff joined them and they started for the courtroom
as has been stated christopher waffle owned a threshing outfit
his profession was that of an itinerant thresher of grain incidentally as will be remembered he was also justice of the peace
there was in christopher waffle a certain warmth of originality and sharpness of purpose i his friend the enemy that had earned him the sobriquet of hot waffle
but christopher waffle cared not for public opinion good or ill
he made it his ex clusive aim to please waffle and thus was always sure of being on good terms with himself whatever might be the state of his feelings toward the rest of mankind
when guy barney and pettibone entered the room the judge had not yet arrived
col keever was there however his white hat severely set upon his ample browsmute testimony of his mental condition
there also was lem bilkins twisted about a chair in close proximity to the colonel and watching his every movement with an admiration that was almost soulful
glimmer was glimmer having agreed to look after the emporium during his absenceand pinney the druggist and leffingwell proprietor of the livery stable and sampson and mr barberry who was supposed to be a lawyer and who pos sessed a painfully meagre form a hatchet face had an impediment in his speech and had been retained by the defense
others were present but none especially noteworthy
the buzz of conver sation ceased abruptly upon the coming of the sheriff with his prisonersfor it was plain that guy was considered in the light of a malefactor spared the odium of imprisonment merely because of pettibone and upon the latters responsibility
frigid looks were directed at guy by every one exceptstrange as it may appearthe redoubt keever versus liscomb io3 able colonel
the manager of the townsite com pany had slept upon the incidents of the preceding afternoon and had come to the conclusion that he had been somewhat hasty with guy
solely by grace of the young man he was directing the affairs of the town
the office was no sinecure but if concord won in the contest his paper would boom and his nest would be feathered in other ways
for these reasons the glances he shot in direction were of the sorrowful and injured butforgiving kind
a chair a table a glass and a broken water pitcher were awaiting the judge who finally ar rived
he was clad in overalls carelessly tucked into his boottops was in his shirt sleeves and carried an oil can in one hand and a bunch of waste in the other
bill comfort bearing a large book was close at his employers heels
it looks as though you people never would get through lawin growled the judge
here it is only two months from the biggest harvest we have had in the territory yet and got to leave my threshing machine and come here
at this point his honor exchanged his oil can and bunch of waste for the book
sit down bill he commanded and the engi neer tipped lem bilkins out of his chair and seated himself
now continued the judge laying the book down on the table and throwing himself into his seat was busy yesterday afternoon and donot his friend the enemy know what this is all about body
mr barberry got up
tell me some if you ppplease your honor i have the to apapap that was the extent of mr utter ance for the time
he grew red in the face whistled stamped his foot and struck himself in the side all to no purpose
then the colonel suave dignified voluble arose
your honor said he this is an action brought against one barney liscomb for mali ciously threatening my life with a shotgun seen him do it declared lem bilkins
you hush bilkins
you too keever
i wouldnot try to say anything if its painful bar berry
sit down and keep still all of you the boss of this threshing outfit
this is a court of law your honor and not a threshing outfit remonstrated the colonel
it isnot eh
i say a court of law is a moral threshing machine it separate the wheat from the chaff
right you are waff seconded bill comfort
the judge frowned at his engineer
this is no theayter he resumed
what have you been doing barney
your honor began the lawyer for the defence distress yourself barberry sit down
i was talking to liscomb
keever versus liscomb him in this cccase
not in this court
sit down i tell you
now barney
but your honor ccc stuttered bar berry red and desperate
stop your whistling and stomping you know any better than to whistle and stomp in a court of justice
but mr lislisliscomb the judge glared at the lawyer so sternly he wilted into his chair
shall i throw him out waff asked bill com fort making a pugilistic gesture with the bunch of waste
no said the judge withdrawing his glare from barberry and bestowing it upon his engineer but tell you what you can do bill comfort
you can keep still or throw you out and no two ways about it
now barney
barney stood up and was about to speak when col keever broke in ahead of him
your honor it is customary first to hear the plaintiff
i beg to be allowed to make my state ment
and i beg to be allowed to tell you to mind your ps and qs is my authority to be respected or isnot it
col keever coughed and thrust his hand into his bosom will address this court sir
you will will you exclaimed waffle starting io6 up slowly
his friend the enemy if you say much more keever the dignity of this court is going to be badly im paired a disgrace to the law you profess to represent
silence or fine you for contempt
if my fine was in proportion to my contempt scored the colonel a million dollars wouldnot pay it
now youre getting personal
pettibone if that man forgets himself again take him down to the end of the hall and lock him up
while here this thing is going to be run according to waffle
come here barney and swear you
barney laid his hand on the book while the oath was administered then he was asked in a tone of judicial severity did you point a deadly weapon at that gentle man in the white hat
yes sir
what was ita shot gun
yes sir
what was it loaded with shot
how far were you from col keever at the time
about fifty feet
now then answer me squareup
if your gun had gone off would it have killed our respected friend think it would sir
keever versus liscomb the judge leaned forward in his chair
then why in didnot you shoot
a painful silence settled over the courtroom and then there came a titter from some one some where in the crowd
guy laughed outright
springing erect the colonel inflated his broad chest and fastened his eyes on waffle
sir he cried in a voice whose every intona tion sent a palpitating chill through lem bilkins you are invested with the sacred majesty of law and i would rather cut off my right hand than raise it against one of the noblest of my countrys institutions but that will do keever cut in the judge
make any more comments on my way of doing things and fine you and levy on your old blanket sheet for the amount the kind of a frontier product that makes an honest man blush for his race having your day now but the time will come when the people will find you out
beware of that time keever thats my advice to you
col keever turned stiffly and strode to the door
there he halted to shake his cane at the judge and exclaim wrathfully you shall answer for this sir
egad i shall see that you answer for this he flounced out of the room and the judge laughed and called after him whenever youre ready for me colonel youll find ready for you
liscomb i shall have to his friend the enemy fine you not for what you did do but for what you didnot do
if you will promise he was interrupted by the wild tolling of a bell
his words died away on his lips and he sat rigidly upright listening to the sound as though fasci nated
pettibone gave a startled jump
a death like stillness was everywhere broken only by the heavy breathing of those in the room the alarm l cried glimmer his voice shak ing with excitement the harmony men are coming after the records
the harmony men l adjourned shouted waffle leaping over the table
run for the courthouse every man of you
there followed a scrambling rush for the door accompanied by fierce yells and shouts of defiance
in the confusion guy and barney were separated from the sheriff and from each other
left to his own devices guy drew back and then trailed along in the rear of the crowd which swept down the stairs and off up the street in the direction of the courthouse
when the excited concordians reached the court house they found absolutely no sign of a foe
all was quiet and peaceful and the men who had formed themselves into a hasty cordon about the building began to look at each other dubiously
their attention was finally attracted by mrs glimmer who came out in front of the emporium
who rang the bell she cried nervously you know returned her husband in a bewildered tone havenot the slightest idea benjamin
i heard a noise upstairs and ran to see what was the matter
while i was gone some one rang the bell
dear sakes are the harmony folks comin you worry amanda
whether they come or not here
did you see any one in the store when you came down
not a soul a howdedo boys said glimmer in a puzzled tone
who could have rung that bell and what was it rung for
sampson up on top of the blizzard building shouted bilkins
io9 i his friend the enemy sampson was there sure enough shading his eyes with his hand and looking off towards har mony
see any one samp cried pettibone see a thing called back sampson
some one must have played a joke on you fel lows
joke spluttered waffle
if we could find the man who played a joke of that kind wed string him up
coincident with the remark the colonel rounded the front of the blizzard building
his whole manner was one of hauteur and utter in difference
the crowd around the courthouse watched him in silence
the great man had been treated shabbily
the citizens realized that now and as their sympathy deepened for the colonel their anger arose against the judge
the colonel mounted slowly and with dignity step by step
on reaching the upper landing he laid his hand on the knob of the office door hesi tated and then turned and vouchsafed his atten tion to the group below
men of concord he said sonorously chris topher waffle has spared a traitor this dayat my expense
you have been cozened deceived by some confederate of this confederate raised a disturbance in living apart ments and while mrs glimmer went to ascertain the cause of the unwonted noise the confederate slipped into the emporium and rang the bell
dilemma what was the effect
i i i in the confusion that re sulted the traitor escaped
search among you and see if i am not correct
the colonel entered his office and slammed the door
he had had his fling
upon them he had returned a moiety of the disparagement that had a short time before been his
and he was right as usual for liscomb was nowhere to be found nor could the confederate be discovered
after a hrief period of search the citizens went their sev eral ways
guy and pettibone turned in the direction of the hotel
while sauntering leisurely along discussing the incidents of the morning sampson passed them
the printer was going to the postoffice to get the mail and he had his hands in his pockets and was whistling lustily
any one could have seen with half an eye that he was very well satisfied with himself want a word with sampson in private petti bone said guy
will you wait here a moment while i overtake him
going to put up a job to give me the slip inquired the sheriff with a wink hadnot thought of such a thing
all right go on
guy called to sampson and came up with him a dozen yards ahead
there is one man in this town sampson remarked guy who knows all about your deal ings with the harmony people
his friend the enemy the printers jaw dropped and a troubled look shot athwart his freckled face that he mumbled
guy repeated his words and sampson cast an apprehensive glance behind him
what are you trying to get at any how he demanded putting on a bold front tell you in a moment
but for a combi nation of unusual circumstances that came to my aid youd have got me into a peck of trouble monday night
i have the note you wrote to vlandingham
you made a mistake when you used the back of an old sheet of copy
i have identified that copy with a printed leader in the blizzard and the circumstantial evidence against you is complete
the red faded out of face and left it a sickly white
his frightened glances focused upon the sheriff for an instant and then returned to guy know went on guy that you assisted col dingle to get out of that closet in the hotel and i think that you are also the confederate who helped barney to make his escape
sampson moistened his dry lips with his tongue not saying a word about anything he observed finally
what are you going to do about it am merely going to advise you to stop this trafficking with the enemy
if i promise not to turn you over to pettibone and tell the concord dilemma people what you have done will you be a good citizen after this
sure was the printers prompt reply
he was greatly relieved and showed it do more than that and give you this letter right now in stead of sneaking into the hotel and slipping it under the door of your room as i was going to do after i went to the postoffice
sampson took a square pink envelope from the breast of his coat and handed it to guy hired man brought that over to me at oclock last night
he said he couldnot deliver it himself as the sheriff was sleeping with one eye open in front of your room door and he wanted me to slip it into your hands
guy looked at the superscription of the missive
the chirography was graceful and distinctly femi nine
of course he did not know who the letter was from but he could imagine and his eyes brightened and his face flushed a good thing youre going to keep still about me grinned sampson not the only fellow who has established communication with the enemy
he went away chuckling while guy dropped the note quickly into his breast pocket and waited for the sheriff to rejoin him he give you something queried petti bone as they walked on
nothing of much importance guy answered his friend the enemy the sheriff was thoughtful for a space and then asked abruptly did you ever see a duel mr herbert
what kind of a duel one of the oldfashioned kind
guess you know about as much how they did it as i do in defiance of the law and i suppose have to go out and linger around even if i donot do anything
you can have your choice between being locked up while i am gone or going with me go with you pettibone sensible
we may have a little fun inci dentally
read that
the sheriff fished a folded paper out of his pocket and guy opened the sheet and read as follows concord june mr richard pettibone sheriff of goodwill county concord dear sir one who cherishes the law as the dearest of our countrys institutions and who has become aware of a terrible crime about to be committed comes to you with these presents asserting that challenge and acceptance to fight a duel have passed between two of the most worthy people of goodwill county
challenge was issued from the editorial office of the norther and ac cepted in the sanctum of the be it stated in direct violation of paragraph chapter penal code of this territory
this affair of honor unless thwarted by exercise of your authority will take place at oclock in dilemma the afternoon of wednesday june on the north shore of lake elizabeth
if you have a decent regard for the peace and wellbeing of this community let me supplicate you forthwith to take such steps as may seem advisable for averting an impending catastrophe
proceed to the scene of this intended crime and resort to force if necessary in overturning the sanguinary plans of the duellists
this states plainly enough that the two col onels are the principals in the affair said guy
the fact of this proposed duel is no news to me however as i already had knowledge of it from col keever himself
who is this pro bono publico i wonder
you wonder eh returned pettibone with another of his winks you know that there is only one man in this town who could or would write a letter of that kind
who is that
hold that letter close to your nose and get a good whiff of it ink said guy
right you are the kind of printers ink they use on the blizzard
you donot mean to say that col keever wrote this letter himself
yes i do
why hes simply furious and vows that hell have life
by this time they were at the lisbon house and i his friend the enemy pettibone with one hand on the veranda railing threw back his head and laughed boisterously
keever is playing to the galleries said he the slickest hand at makebelieve that i ever knew and known a good many
he hasnot any more thought of fighting a duel than i have but hell act as bloodthirsty as a savage you see that if i go out to lake elizabeth and interfere by force to prevent the duel hell come out of the scrape in high feather
the rank and file of this town have never dropped a plum met to the bottom of the nature but chris waffle has and so have thats sure going out there to stop it are you going out there but not to stop it an swered pettibone folding the letter which guy had handed back to him and replacing it in his pocket going out there to hide in the brush and look on
my word for it mr herbert it will stop itself seethe north shore of lake eliza beth at oclock wednesday afternoon
if you will promise not to take french leave run over to the house and tell my boy alec to hitch up and drive around here about oclock worry about me pettibone answered guy shanot leave this town until the county seat contest is decided one way or the other
i have too much at stake
all right then
i wonot be gone more than half an hour
thereupon the sheriff strode off down the street dilemma i i and guy went up on the veranda and seated him self
at that hour pedro smith was in the kitchen overseeing the preparations for dinner
guy was alone in that quarter and he removed the pink envelope very gently from his pocket and opened it and drew forth the perfumed sheet
it was really from miss betty and his heart beat faster than usual as he read the dainty writing
dear friend there is a matter of grave im portance which i wish to discuss with you
as i cannot come to concord and you cannot come to harmony may i ask you to meet me at some neutral point tomorrow wednesday afternoon at oclock
there is a pretty little lake which is named after me and which lies equally distant be tween the two elizabeth
please meet me there
yours very truly pinkney will accompany me but i shall expect you to come alone
the joy which guy felt over this proposed meet ing with miss betty was lost in the consternation which suddenly seized upon him
by what strange coincidence had she appointed for their meeting the very place day and hour fixed upon by the duellists for their affair of honor
and how was he to go alone when he had already agreed to go with the sheriff
anyhow how could he go alone any place
guy was in despair
he did not see how he could possibly engineer affairs so as to prevent i his friend the enemy miss betty from getting the idea that he was twofaced and had betrayed to the sheriff the con tents of her letter
here was a dilemma of gigantic proportions and how was he to get around it
guy had an idea that he might telegraph miss vlandingham he would be at lake elizabeth at oclock but that through circumstances over which he had no control the sheriff would ac company him
a little reflection convinced him that it would not be well to send a message of this kind so instead of that he sent the follow ing please appoint another day same place
this was tantamount to saying that he would not be able to meet miss betty at the rendezvous and guy highly pleased with the way he had got around the difficulty returned from the telegraph office to the hotel
unfortunately he did not observe that col keever was in the freight department of the depot where he had come to find out whether the patent outsides for the next issue of the blizzard had yet arrived
un seen the colonel overheard the young mans colloquy with the operator
what the great man did after that will soon appear
pettibone joined guy at dinner
after the meal they smoked their cigars and chatted in friendly i his friend the enemy fashion until oclock when young alec drove a highstepper and a covered buggy up to the hotel veranda
guy and the sheriff immediately got into the vehicle and drove off leaving young alec staring wistfully after them
very soon the travellers were out of town and rolling rapidly along the level road which worn deeply into the turf was almost as hard and smooth as asphalt
the sun had half descended the western sky a few vaporous clouds floated overhead and a balmy wind blew from the north west and languidly rippled the grass and the flowers
the whistle of a robin and the plaintive notes of a meadow lark thrilled through the scene giving a touch of melody to a day already per fect
this is something like living remarked guy again and again filling his lungs to their fullest capacity with the warm sweet air what assented pettibone
if a man was only out in these parts for his health what a time he could have god made the country they say and men make the town lovely until civilized people come along tickle the soil with a plow and make it laugh wheat and oats and then the trouble begins
seems like the more nature smiles and shows her good feelings the more unsociable people become
now look there the sheriff waved his hand towards the stretch of prairie dotted with squares of growing grain each square pushing the shack of its owner as far an affair of honor i towards its limits as you ever see anything purtier
but theres a heart in every one of those shacks mr herbert thats bitter as gall over this countyseat question
and if it wasnot that it would be something else
i tell you a human bein has got to have a grievance to nurse or fondle or tuck away or put up on a pole and howl about or he wonot be contented right
why are the farmers so deeply interested in the countyseat fight
most of em have a lot or two in town so its a pocketbook affair with them
those that havenot any lots just take sides in order to have some thing to quarrel about
the farmer that lives nearest to concord is a concord man and the one closest to harmony is for that town tooth and nail
sile his house way over yender you can see it just over the lash of my whip nowwell when he first built his claim shanty it was right square between the two towns not a foot farther from concord than it was from harmony
for a long time sile didnot know what to do for a grievance and it worried him so that he hitched his team to his shack one night and pulled it over onto the northeast corner of his hundred and sixty
that brought him nearer concord see
when the countyseat was located in concord and things got fairly quiet there he was blue as a whetstone till he hauled his shack across to the southwest corner of the quarter and i his friend the enemy that made a harmony man out of him
just now it donot make any difference which side of his farm hes on
sile can be in hot water all the time so hes just about as comfortable in the spirit as any man can be and live
and thats the way it goes
dick pettibone was full of anecdote and reminis cence and sage reflections on life and the half hour which it required for the highstepper to trot them to their destination was whiled away most agreeably
lake elizabeth was a small but beautiful ex panse of water shimmering like a diamond against the green of the plain
on all sides the banks had a gentle slope and there were wide reaches of white sand skirting the waters edge
to the north were two small groves of cotton woods standing kneedeep in a dense undergrowth half an hour ahead of time said petti bone and consequently are first on the ground
suppose we make ourselves comfortable among those cottonwoods where we canot be seen and await developments
thus speaking he headed his horse toward the more southerly of the two groves
in a little time the horse and buggy had been hidden in the brushy tangle and the sheriff and guy had hit upon a point of vantage from which entirely un observed they could see the north shore of the lake in its full extent
they had no more than settled themselves com an affair of honor fortably when a fall of hoofs reached their ears and they saw near the crest of the sloping shore two horsemen descending at a gallop toward the other grove
by cracky muttered pettibone
if there ainot old man glimmer and lem bilkins a feejee now what the dickens are they here for
tell me that somebody and be obliged
look at that going into hiding in the other grove
well be dinged bilkins and glimmer disappeared in the brush and among the trees to the north and all was outwardly as calm and serene as before
the next arrivals were col dingle and capt blue who drove a redwheeled gig over the rise and down to a sentinel cottonwood that stood apart
the captain and the colonel were joking and laughing and one would have imagined that a duel was as ordinary a matter with them as col keever had informed guy it had once been with him
capt blue hitched the horse to a tree and as he finished and turned away col keever and samp son drove merrily upon the scene
the editor of the blizzard was smoking a cigar and his extreme nonchalance was the most noticeable thing about him
good afternoon gentlemen he called courte ously to those already on the field
col dingle and capt blue nodded distantly and col keever shrugged his fat shoulders i his friend the enemy chuckled cynically and got down from the buggy
groping around under the seat he succeeded in fiinding and in drawing into sight a large revolver
facing about he pressed a spring pulled down the barrel and gave a businesslike glance at the cartridges in the cylinder
this done he snapped the revolver together knocked the ashes from his cigar with the muzzle and swaggered over in the direction of his opponent
well said dingle sharply if you are ready pace off the distance and let us get this affair over with first flip a quarter for choice of posi tions returned keever giving a side glance at the sun
the last time i figured in an affair of this kindwas it the last now or the next to the lastwell anyway i fought with the sun in my eyes and only pinked my man
still your reminiscences are very interesting but i think we can dispense with them cut in capt blue taking a quarter out of his pocket
once for all col keever
what is it
the coin twirled in the air
heads cried keever and won the toss
taking up his position with his back to the west he motioned to sampson
the printer came at once leaving the horse un hitched
although the horse was known to be gentle it was a foolish thing for sampson to leave it in this way
sampson pace off twenty steps with capt an affair of honor i blue commanded keever
if youd rather make it ten dingle agreeable
five l cried the little colonel
would you like to have me tie a handkerchief over one of my eyes asked col keever with exasperating condescension dislike to take any advantage of you you be disturbed flared dingle hotly
when it comes to pistol practice my one eye is as good as your two eyes any day
calm yourself dingle or your aim will be bad
sampson see that i get five pacesor less
five very short paces were stumped off by the captain who punctuated the distance by driving his wooden leg into the sand at both posi tions
all right colonel sung out sampson and the principals were soon back to back weapons in hand awaiting the fall of capt cap which was to be the signal to turn and fire
from their places of concealment in the brush guy and pettibone were listening to the conversa tion and watching the sanguinary preparations with intense interest
was it to be a tragedy after all instead of a farce
guy was beginning to grow nervous better go out and stop this before its too late he said excitedly kill each other to pettibone you believe it returned the sheriff con fidently
hear that i this is where bilkins and his friend the enemy glimmer take a hand and warrant keever put them up to it
bilkins and glimmer had suddenly leaped from the other patch of timber and guy and the sheriff saw them bound over the intervening space and hurl themselves upon col keever
sampson had also seized his employer and the three were strug gling with him in great desperation
capt blue took a pipe from one pocket a handful of tobacco from another and filled the pipebowl calmly and methodically while watching apparently desperate attempt to free himself
stand off shouted dingle
break away from that scoundrel or open fire on you all no attention was paid to him
go for the whole lot dingle advised the captain applying a match to his pipe and puffing out little clouds of white vapor
crack l came a shot from the little revolver
the bullet plumped into the ground at the feet of the struggling quartet throwing a spurt of sand into the air
at this ominous sound the four concordians separated and began to run
the report also frightened the horse attached to the buggy and the animal took to a wild gallop and vanished over the swell in a twink ling
crack crack crack volleyed the little revolver and faster and faster fled the an affair of honor concordians the gallant keever despite his avoirdupois keeping well in the lead
dingle gave chase and continued to follow until his weapon was empty and his foes out of sight then he returned shook hands with capt blue and they unhitched their horse climbed into the redwheeled gig and drove unconcernedly away
pettibone was rolling on the ground kicking his heels and choking with tumultuous mirth
guy shared the sheriffs enjoyment with the same ap preciation if not the same abandon but the laughter died suddenly upon his lips
he had chanced to look out over the sandy shore of the lake and the vision that met his gaze had hushed his merriment
after he had turned away to rub his eyes he looked again
could he believe the evidence of his senses
pettibone was not slow to observe the change that had come over his companion
getting up quickly he drew close to side and likewise peered through the bushes
great jupiter he exclaimed
if there ainot daughter and another girl a hottentot just go out and interview them
he started out as he spoke but guy grabbed him and jerked him roughly back
no you donot l said the young man firmly
a why was miss vlandingham there
was it pos sible that she had not received his message
these questions flashed through brain but he had no time to debate them
pettibone smart ing under his summary treatment was as near angry as he ever became a good fellow all right herbert muttered the sheriff but be dinged if going to let you slam me around like that
i can be sociable and pleasant if i want to and i can be the other thing too
you mustnot go out there said guy nodding his head towards the beach
shucks
any one would think to hear you talk that the prisoner and youre the sheriff
you canot boss me no siree
look here pettibone returned guy earnestly no need of our having a particle of diffi culty
those ladies have come here to meet me
an appointment eh
yes
who made it
they did
i i his friend the enemy funny thing that they should appoint this place and this particular time observed the sheriff cynically a coincidence but i canot see anything very humorous about it a coincidence that doesnot coincide telling you the truth averred guy flush ing at this pointblank doubt of his veracity
they wanted me to come out here alone and talk with them on an important matter
the appointment was made by letter received this morning
naturally i had no time to inform miss vlandingham that i was under surveillance and if she sees you shell think i brought you been a capital fellow all along pettibone
be one now canot you
stay here while i go out and talk with them
and put up a job for beating concord out of the countyseat eh
not much a little the most peculiar fellow i ever saw herbert
with as big a bunch of lots as youve got in con cord youre willing to throw up everything on account of a chit of a girl like betty vlanding ham
see here retorted guy warmly miss vlan dingham is a lady and not the kind of a girl to try to put up a job as you call it with any one
i am just as loyal to concord as you are every whit
heaven knows i ought to be for if we lose the countyseat i shall be a financial wreck and will have to hunt around for somebody who wants a misunderstanding a bookkeeper
have a little reason pettibone guy implored casting a hasty glance in the direc tion of the ladies and noting that miss vlanding ham was standing up in the buggy and looking around perplexedly
if i donot go out pretty soon theyll think not coming
stay here and keep quiet and give you a block of lots
you canot bribe me answered pettibone and you canot go out there either
the steely flash shot into eyes and the lines tightened at the corners of his mouth
you refuse to let me pass he demanded as pettibone stepped in front of him certainly do
everybody in concord wanted you locked up because as they said you were ruining the chances of the town with your gadding about
but i says no young gentlemen says and a pair of blue eyes has a fascination for him i says take him in tow and watch him i says and see to it that he doesnot com municate with the enemy with that particular enemy i says any more
now thats what i done herbert and here you are first jump out of the box trying to get me into trouble
you donot go out there i tell you flat
and i tell you that i am going answered guy vehemently
he made a spring to the left with the intention of darting past the sheriff but the latter was fully as quick and threw himself sideways catching arm and clinging to him like a leech
pant i his friend the enemy ing the two stood for a second and gazed at each other donot wish to hurt you pettibone said guy in a tense tone but i assure you that i am going out to talk with miss vlandingham do nothing treasonable i promise you that you take the word of a gentleman not taking anybodys word just now was obstinate rejoinder
here you are and here youll stay
then look out for yourself
with these words guy closed with the sheriff
the young man had a splendid muscular develop ment which his appearance in a measure belied
he was likewise the possessor of a fair amount of fistic science and wrestling skill which his quiet demeanor and modest bearing were far from sug gesting
a knowledge of all this was quickly made manifest to pettibone and the realization that he had met more than his match was about the last tangible thought he had for several minutes
in a twinkling he was neatly thrown and in falling his head came in violent contact with a tree root so that he was stunned and his hold on guy re laxed
after contracting strongly his limbs were flung out with a jerk and he closed his eyes and lay motionless
guy was alarmed at first but when he had pressed the tips of his fingers through thick hair and felt the skull at the point where it had come in contact with the root his apprehen a misunderstanding i sion vanished
there was nothing to worry over and the sheriff would be himself again very shortly
removing coat guy wrapped it up compactly and placed it under his head then he hurried to the buggy and secured the halter rope that was under the seat
coming back he tied the sheriffs hands behind him with one end of the halter and secured the other end about the tree beside whose trunk the sheriff had fallen
he worked rapidly only a few minutes elapsing between his attack upon pettibone and his final work with the halter
without waiting an in stant guy pushed through the intervening thicket and started down the grassy descent toward the carriage
miss betty a vexed expression on her pretty face had just tightened the lines with one of her gloved hands and taken the whip from its socket with the other when she saw guy approaching
the vexed look faded into a dazzling smile
well truant cried miss betty did you re main away purposely to punish us for being late clothing was somewhat disarranged and a wondering light came into miss eyes as she gazed at him
miss pinkney was as reserved as usual although she smiled in friendly spirit and evidently partook of her companions curiosity came as quickly as i could miss vlanding ham answered guy settling his collar and ar i his friend the enemy ranging his scarf
please pardon my disordered appearanceit could not be helped
miss betty indulged in one of her silvery laughs
you did not walk all the way here from con cord did you she queried
no
the horse and buggy that brought me are over there among the trees
your appoint ment was for oclock if i remember
yes and i should have been here punctually but for lois
she misunderstood that part of our programme and was late in getting to our house to accompany me
but here we are at last and if we have not entirely exhausted your patience mr herbert perhaps i had better proceed at once with the matter which led me to seek this inter view
pardon me just a moment
guy had ad vanced to the forward wheel on miss side of the buggy
he was very close to her and in the few times he had seen her she had never been more lovely in his eyes than she was then
the breeze had brought a fresh ruddy color to her cheeks and her broadbrimmed straw hat was most becoming was going to ask you pro ceeded guy conscious of an awkward pause if you were at home all the afternoon up to the time you left to drive here was at home the entire afternoon answered miss betty
and did you not receive my message
your message she echoed
a misunderstanding yes
i i sent you a telegram
then it was not delivered to me strange murmured guy
what was the message
nothing very important
messages are usually quite important if they are telegraphed should have said that it is not very im portant now so we need not concern ourselves any further about it
as you said a moment ago you are here and here and we can talk over the matter about which you wished to see me
what is it miss vlandingham
possibly i am acting a treasonable part she answered thoughtfully but i have already told you how i abhor any show of force or suggestion of violence
the concord people have not taken a course calculated to lessen the bitterness in separable from a contest of this kind know that very well said guy as miss betty paused
much of the evil was done before i reached concord and during the short time i have been in town i have had no influence what ever with the citizens
guy smiled as he said this wondering what miss betty would think if he told her the plain truth of his situation
if i wish to do anything thats really commendable he added obliged to resort to force and violence myself
miss betty raised her eyebrows interrogatively but guy would not answer her unspoken question
his friend the enemy in a few moments he cursed his folly for not doing so while he had the opportunity
a woful misun derstanding would thus have been avoided hope no unpleasantness has resulted from the timely aid you gave those two sisters of char ity said miss betty demurely have only pleasure in the thought that i was able to assist them answered guy gallantly
as he spoke he fancied he heard a noise in the undergrowth behind him and looked around has tily
he could see nothing to arouse his suspi cions and both miss betty and her friend followed his quick look with questioning eyes
you were about to tell why you wanted to see me miss vlandingham continued guy smother ing every symptom of alarm and looking as calm and selfpossessed as was possible under the cir cumstances donot think you could be treason able if you tried
indeed she exclaimed with a smile
how do you know that i have not summoned you here to make a captive of you
how do you know sir that i have not a horde of harmony people at my beck and call lying in ambush yonder
guy laughed at the tragic air she put on to fit the words am sure there are no harmony people over there he replied trying to imagine what the sheriff was doing by this time
nevertheless you seem very nervous said miss betty
it is getting late and you are a misunderstanding i anxious to start homeward i can see very plainly so i will hasten to finish the business that brought me
snapping with the whip lash at a wild rose blooming on the verge of sandy beach and prairie sod she went on in a manner that was captivat ingly confidential
capt blue one of har monys most warlike citizens has organized a company of invincibles and is drilling them night and day
there are a score of men in the com pany and i am very much afraid mr herbert that possessing the means for some headstrong piece of work will lead to the work being done
i have tried to break up the invincibles and to scatter them but what can one woman do against twenty armed men
they have defied me and declare that they are organized to protect their homes at the expense of their lives if need be
now concord is taking just the course to cause trouble and arouse the invincibles to something overt and desperate
i was going to ask you to use your influence with your fellow townsmen and see if you could not impress upon them the ex pediency of a more conciliatory attitude
and now you tell me that you have no influence i am very sorry to hear that for i have grave fears of the invincibles
if only miss betty was interrupted by a quavering shout instantly followed by fiercer yells in voices of stronger timbre heart leaped into his throat and he whirled about in the direction from which the sounds came
his friend the enemy this is a trap for us betty cried miss pinkney in startled tones
oh mercy
what shall we do
concord people miss pinkney was right as to the newcomers being concord people but wrong terribly wrong in suggesting such a thing as a trap
bilkins glimmer and pettibone were dashing across the stretch of treeless plain straight to ward them
they looked most formidable espe cially the sheriff whose whole manner suggested the avenging nemesis of fabled origin
and this cried miss betty passionate re proach in her every tone this is your doing mr herbert your base plot will fail but i shall never forget it never never
she cut her horse with the whip and the animal sprang away so swiftly that miss becom ing hat was jerked from her fair head and fell to the bottom of the carriage
as for guy he was stricken dumb in his tracks
he could say nothing do stand where he was and watch the carriage disappear on one hand and the shouting and angry trio advance on the other
what untimely fate had brought bilkins and glimmer to the sheriffs rescue and made possible this awful finale
guy was soon to know
as they drew close to guy bilkins glimmer and pettibone separated surrounded him and pressed cautiously in from three points of the compass
when within a dozen feet of the young man the sheriff threw up his right hand
this was a pre arranged signal for the attacking force to halt for a parley
if you try to resist us herbert said petti bone menacingly be mighty sorry for it before we get through a good feller as i said but even a good feller is generally able to tell when hes got enough
where did bilkins and glimmer come from inquired guy
we circled around back to get our horses spoke up glimmer
we didnot know but those two harmony chaps might still be here admitted bilkins artlessly so we did our circlin tother side the swell and out of sight
my i thought i was a goner sure my legs were about ten feet too short and goodness knows theyre plenty long for most occasions
the runnin yet
i 4o his friend the enemy if i didnot know the colonel so well said glimmer should think he was a coward
but a man who saw so much slaughter in our late war couldnot be that
i wasnot afraid glared through his ironrimmed glassesand i just ran after the colonel to see if i couldnot persuade him to come back
he shook his fist in the direction of harmony
if i ever meet that blue alone but words proved powerless and he finished with an ominous frown and shake of the head
oh yes commented pettibone sarcastically if you ever get at blue i suppose there wonot be anything left but splinters
will you surrender herbert or have we got to close in on you have a half notion to close in on you re turned guy irritably made a pretty mess of this those ladies are positive now that i had the three of you lying in ambush donot care what they think answered the sheriff probably be lying over there yet if bilkins and glimmer hadnot passed near enough to hear me call to them have to be locked up after this
try to lock me up and you may find youve caught a tartar retorted guy
because i have submitted peaceably to your surveillance that is no sign i do not know my rights broken no law and if you try any highhanded measures make this county too hot to hold you fellows
if the indictment i necessary have a company of soldiers here to protect me
the harmony invincibles i suppose sneered pettibone
no sir a company of regulars from standing rock or fort totten
think you didnot break any law when you knocked my head against that tree root and tied me up with a halter eh
pettibone rubbed the back of his head as he said this and assumed such an injured air that guy had to laugh in spite of his vexation
lem bilkins once more glimmer unbent himself so far as to smile and pettibone who always had a laugh lurking somewhere close to the surface was caught in the general hilar ity
anyway qualified the sheriff there ainot going to be much fun in this for you herbert
of course you havenot broken any of the statutes but the concord folks wonot stop to think of that
well an idea that i can take care of my self said guy have told you once or twice and i tell you again i havenot done anything treasonable and just as loyal to concord as col keever himself
glimmer and bilkins exchanged sly glances tittered suggestively
guy kindled at this said nothing and went with pettibone to help back the horse and carriage out of the brush and but him by his friend the enemy the time they were started glimmer and bilkins were two galloping specks on the horizon pretty powerful in a setto observed pettibone driving with one hand and stroking the back of his head with the other
your looks are deceivin herbert
perhaps the rest of the concord people will find that out if they take too arbitrary a course said guy significantly was only trying to do my duty and you treated me a little bit rough continued etti bone but i know how it is
a pair of blue eyes has bewitched more than one young feller and not going to lay up anything against you
i donot think youd be such a fool as to help har mony at the expense of concord knowingly but miss betty is pretty cute coddlin you along just to find out what our side is doing and mistaken l cried guy so sharply and suddenly that pettibone gave a startled jump and then settled back in his seat with a low whistle
miss vlandingham is far above any such double dealing as that
the sheriff shook his head hopelessly exactly the way it strikes in he mut tered had the same kind of a spell and got so ethereal i didnot want to eat or do a blessed thing but write poetry
if matilda had told me grasshoppers were butterflies or that jimson pods were lilies of the valley have fought with the the indictment man who called em by their right names
that was before we got married though now its different
what are you talking about pettibone
the sheriff laid a hand on his heart and winked
that little chap with a pair of wings and a bow and arrow has been getting in his work on you and hes hit you so fair and square that everybody can see it
pshaw exclaimed guy coloring talk nonsense not
betty vlandingham is a fine girl but shes on the other side o the fence
she bosses her father and her father bosses the town consequently things go about as she says over in harmony
but looket here sheriff dropped his hand lightly on do for you to be meeting her
as far as per sonally concerned i think youre true as a die and i donot lay up anything against you on ac count of that crack on the head and your work with the halter
there are others though who wonot think as i do when nodded his head towards the little column of dust far in ad neord publish your meeting with miss vlandingham from one end of town to the other
and what will be the result
he shook his head seriously hate to think of it i do for a fact
you musnot meet that girl again least not before the election
small chance of my ever meeting her again his friend the enemy said guy in angry discontent
she sent a line to me as i told you asking me to come alone and meet her and miss pinkney
now she thinks a treacherous hound who disregarded her request and brought you and glimmer and found them lalong with me
much bitterness of spirit was manifested in voice and the sheriff gave him his earnest attention have plenty of chances to explain said he and when betty vlandingham finds out how she has wronged you shell think all the more of you
oh i know em twas that way with me and matilda
why we used to quarrel every few days before we got married and now look at us
hitched by gee and quarrelin all the time
pettibone chuckled to himself
you leave vlan dinghams girl alone until we win this election then waltz over to harmony and tell her you want to give her a dower interest in your town snap you up too quick see if she donot
on reaching concord guy went with pettibone to put up his horse and then they made for the hotel
passing the emporium they saw mr glimmer inside holding forth to a small and select gathering of citizens
farther on in front of the drug store was lem bilkins likewise engaged
when guy and pettibone passed the second group bilkins hushed his excited discourse and every man to whom he had been speaking turned a glaring eye in direction very evident remarked guy that a the indictment prophet without honor in my own town
before long however every one in concord will see how greatly he was mistaken hope theyll see that before they do anything to be sorry for muttered pettibone
guy did not hear this and perhaps it was just as well
they had suppera late supper of the kind which pedro smith husbanded for stragglersand during the meal and afterward as they sat smoking in the office the sheriff continually mani fested the nervousness of his state of mind
the slightest noise would startle him
once at a whirr of wheels in the street he sprang up and ran to the door returning in a few moments pale and fidgety the matter with you pettibone inquired guy expecting something and am afraid its going to come
what is it delegation of citizens looking for you
guy laughed giving you more concern that it is me
suppose we go to bed
if the delegation arrives after that i hardly think they will dare to disturb us
the indignation committee if such it might be called did not put in an appearance that night nor the next morning
late in the afternoon of the following day however as guy was seated at his friend the enemy the writing table in the hotel office struggling with a letter of explanation which he designed sending to miss betty five representative citizens presented themselves
gee murmured pettibone despairingly here they are herbert
mr pinney the druggist was one of them and mr leffingwell proprietor of the livery stable and mr glimmer of the emporium and mr biggs the register of deedscarrying a tin box and last if not least the redoubtable colonel
the redoubtable colonel had had twentyfour hours in which to recover his equipoise and he had succeeded admirably
to look at him now his white hat tipped slightly over his right eye the tip of his cane planted firmly on the office floor one foot thrown over the other his frock coat caught together with the two lower buttons and his left hand thrust into his bosomto look at him thus he gave no suggestion of his wild struggle and exhausting footrace of the preceding afternoon
guy minced into fine fragments the dozenth sheet on which he had tried to write threw the pieces into a waste basket and turned upon the gentlemen who were grouped beside him
he noted their grim and determined looks and there fell a portentous silence
the wolfs legs performed excellent service yes terday afternoon remarked guy by way of breaking the ice
the indictment we have not come here to discuss that par ticular wolf sir answered the colonel with an uneasy side glance in the direction of his friends
another wolf is the object of this call a wolf in sheeps clothing sir
a wolf with the outward guise of a loyal gentleman but with a heart of softly l interrupted guy forget how i bumped you against the partition the other day
if you made me very angry colonel i might do more than that
the bosom began to heave
it was the wolf probably seeking to get out and show its white teeth and snap
but the wolf did no more than shake its chain for the colonel calmed the brute after a prodigious effort
sir went on the colonel huskily you are young and i will bear with you
i am heading this delegation this righteously indignant delega tion more in sorrow than in anger
we have an indictment against you and i will read it count by count
mr glimmer handed the colonel a paper and the latter continued you are charged mr herbert with treasonable conduct which gravely imperils the interests of this town
specifically the counts are as follows first a visit to house on mon day evening last
have you anything to say
guy shook his head
second you are also charged with assisting daughter when she was among us his friend the enemy disguised as a sister of charity
incidentally you must also have aided in the escape of dingle
will you deny this
guy did not answer
third you attempted to communicate with the enemy yesterday afternoon your telegram being stopped in transmission by myself
by you cried guy half starting from his chair
what business had the telegraph operator holding that message on anybodys order but my own told him you desired it held
guy had a fiery temper and it was hard for him to keep it in bounds
emboldened by his silence the colonel proceeded
fourth you met the enemy yesterday after noon and knocked the sheriff senseless and bound him fast in order that you might carry on your conversation with no loyal concordian at hand to overhear
these are the charges mr herbert
have you still nothing to say have this to say answered guy
from this moment col keever you may consider your self discharged from the service of the townsite company
you are not the whole town young man said the colonel
you are ready to dispense with my services but are these other gentlemen he turned to his interests are quite as completely wrapped up in this town as are yours
the indictment we want you to manage the affairs for us colonel spoke up glimmer
mr herbert may think it policy to try to get along without you but we are of another opinion
the register of deeds the liveryman and the druggist agreed fully with mr glimmer
so you see mr herbert resumed the colonel blandly am still at the helm
harmony has organized a military company for the avowed pur pose as we think of marching over here and taking the countyseat records by force
how far your treasonable conduct has helped this plot along we naturally have no means of knowing but we are taking steps to prevent any catastro phe
our courthouse is roofed over and enclosed and mr biggs will take the colonel struck with his cane the tin box carried by the register of the building
i will lock myself in with the documents and guard them all nightat the expense of my life if need be
as for you mr herbert you may either leave town at once or walk with us to the jail not leave town until i get ready to go replied guy defiantly and if you put me under lock and key break out at the first oppor tunity
this was the young mans final word
he did not resist when piloted across the street by the committee and quietly permitted himself to be conducted to the room over the drug store and locked within it
fresh bedding for the cot was i 5o his friend the enemy brought from the hotel and guy passed a com fortable night in spite of the fact that he was a prisoner
a storm of wind rain thunder and lightning raged during the night but the young man slept through it all to be finally awakened by unwonted noises in the street and by the ringing of mr bell
springing from the cot he began hastily to dress
it was broad daylight and the sun was an hour high
snatches of loud and excited conver sation floated up from the street and through the one barred window guy could catch glimpses of men darting here and there afoot and on horse back while the bell continued its alarming clamor
what was up anyway
just as he finished dressing a key grated in the lock the door was thrown open and christopher waffle ran in
the judge wore a whimsical look although it was plain that he was greatly agi tated the matter judge asked guy
the old boy himself
harmony made a raid on us last night
did they get away with the records
did they
waffle laughed jerkily
they didnot stop at the records but took the colonel and the courthouse along with em
what say that that brand new courthouse is gone slick and clean
as the colonel was inside of it the indictment guarding the records and is nowhere in evidence this morning the surmise is that he was stolen along with the courthouse and the papers
gee whittaker did you ever hear anything to beat it you joking waffle asked guy whose credulity was sorely taxed by the state ment
this is altogether too serious a matter to joke about
concord can spare keever just as well as not but its a big loss to have the records and the courthouse stolen
i guess well have to tally one for harmony this innings
this explains what vlandingham said to pinchbeck said guy reflectively
what was that
why that fools build courthouses and wise men occupy them about what it amounts to
harmony has the laugh on us now and if you run this thing to earth bet you find daughter at the other end of it the only one in harmony whod be able to hatch up such a scheme
guy remembered how he had seen miss betty in the courthouse a tape line in her hand jotting down something in a notebook
it flashed over him at that moment that she had been taking i i his friend the enemy measurements with the view of consummating this coup
how was it done judge queried guy
easy enough
the harmony folks manufac tured a pair of long axles and swung each one between a couple of low broadtired wheels
there was a storm last night if you remember and that was exactly what the other side wanted
the noise of the thunder and the wind and the rain drowned out the commotion they made so that no one in this town heard themunless it was keever and they very soon took care of him guarantee
after they had lifted the court house with jackscrews they slid the wheels under it front and rear and then hitched several teams of horses to it and hauled it away
you can see the tracks of the wheels where they sank into the wet ground
pettibone and several more armed to the teeth have started along the south trail at a gallop
but theyll have their trouble for their pains mark me a notice that was left sticking on a post near the courthouse site and its what i call adding insult to injury with a vengeance
the judge took from his pocket very carefully a wet and bedraggled scrap of paper on which was written the following to the people of concord greeting we needed a courthouse to go with the weathervane so we thought wed take yours
now if you will please i the first victim build us a coal shed to go with the courthouse you will greatly oblige the people of harmony that for a blow between the ribs asked waffle as he returned the paper to his pocket a terrible setback said guy
notwith standing the financial peril with which this success of the opposition threatened him the humor of the situation appealed to the young man and he sat down on the cot and laughed till he choked
if we donot look out for those fellows waffle he observed finally come over here and steal the town
i wish some one would go my bail so i could get out and do a little looking around come to let you out on your own recog nizance herbert that doing it on my own responsibility
you see i told the indignation committee that if they kept you a prisoner theyd have to bring you up for trial
after the way i threw the law into lis comb theyre afraid to have me try your case and so they said theyd keep you a prisoner until after the election
that isnot the law the way i read it and as pettibone is chasing after the courthouse and as got a key to this room i thought this would be a good time to let you scamper
the people have got their heads so full of other things they wonot be able to think of you his friend the enemy for a while and advise you to go some place jimtown or bismarck or anywhere else you want toand stay for a few days until the suspicions and hard feeling against you have a chance to blow over do it said guy and shook hand gratefully
if you hadnot released me though have escaped from here in some way before many hours had passed going to amity ville to see if i canot win a few votes for concord take the risk for nothing afraid
what risk is there
well abe landy rules the roost in amityville and vlandingham has made himself so solid with landy that theyre all redhot for harmony
if you go there however take my advice and stop with landy a miserly old sinner but hes the most fairminded of any one in the town
thanks remember the name
guy followed the judge from the room down the stairs and out into the street
the wild clangor of the bell had ceased and the excited shoutings the grind of carriage and wagon wheels and the fierce tattoo of hoofs had given place to a church yard quiet
there were many people on the street but their hats were pulled moodily down over their brows and they conversed with one another in hushed tones
the stunning effects of the calamity had set in
going over to the lisbon house guy passed through the deserted office to the dining room
the first victim i a waiter served him his breakfast in an agitated and absentminded manner and when the young man had finished his meal he went up to his room packed a few articles in a satchel and then left the hotel and made his way to the livery stable
there were many citizens clustered about the site of the courthouse but they vouchsafed guy no attention whatever
lem bilkins was there sit ting forlornly on one of the four posts that had supported the stolen building
mr biggs the register of deeds was circling sadly about the spot bewailing the loss of his records
mr glim mer reposing on the steps of the emporium was cleaning a huge oldfashioned horse pistol pausing now and again in his work to glare across the street through his heavyrimmed glasses
chil dren were as hopelessly cast down as were their elders and even the dogs took upon themselves the general air of dejection
another stableboy had been employed in the place of barney
his name was herkimer and he had wandered into concord as he expressed it on his uppers
leffingwell had immediately hired him and put him to work
being a new comer herkimer had not had time to acquire any of the prejudices of the town
not knowing guy from adam he made ready a saddle horse without question and the young man after swinging his satchel from the saddlehorn mounted and gath ered up the reins
please tell mr leffingwell that i may not be his friend the enemy back for two or three days said he as i am leaving concord on business appertaining to the countyseat
what name inquired the new hand
herbert
wait stop
i donot think you can have that horse cried the hostler who was familiar with name if not with his face
but guy was well away by this time and gave no heed to summons
there were two roads leading to amityville
the shortest road paralleled the railroad track and led directly through harmony
in order to follow this route it would have been necessary for guy to traverse the main street of concord and bear west from the depot
he did not care to do this or to run the risk of being halted in har mony so he debouched southward along the other road and ambled toward amityville by way of lake elizabeth
this latter course had been the one taken by the men who had spirited away the courthouse and guy saw stretching out before him the broad deep wheelmarks of the gigantic truck which had been improvised by the harmonyites
when near lake elizabeth he suddenly glimpsed half a dozen horsemen galloping rapidly towards him
it was too late to beat a retreat or to gain unnoticed the friendly shelter of the trees on the bank of the lake
he had been so deep in his thoughts that the horsemen were within a short the first victim i quarter of a mile of him before he discovered their approach
he was soon able to distinguish pettibone and pinney and leffingwell but the remaining three were unknown to him
drawing rein he quietly waited
thunder shouted the sheriff herbert
the next moment guy was surrounded by six angry and baffled men
well gentlemen said guy his eyes twinkling did you find the courthouse
you be blamed returned pettibone sourly
how did you get out
that doesnot matter pettibone out and thats enough
as you gentlemen appear to be in anything but an agreeable frame of mind kindly ride out of my way and let me pass on
not much cried pinney escaped and youve got to go back with us the ticket said leffingwell glancing sharply at the horse guy was riding
the three others whom guy did not know were equally as positive that he should go back to concord
pettibone knotted his brows over the problem but said nothing
his horse stood di rectly in front of and as he reflected he snapped his quirt absently against his bootleg
hear me a minute gentlemen said guy donot want to have a clash and sure every thing will be pleasant between us if youll only be reasonable
yesterday i was given my choice 16o his friend the enemy either of leaving town or being locked up
i didnot care to leave town then but willing to do so now
why do you want to stop me
yesterday we had the courthouse blurted out leffingwell and today the other people have got it
that makes all the difference in the world assisted the other people and i suppose you want to go over there and help them cele brate for one am in favor of taking you back to concord and treating you as you deserve
so am seconded pinney
the rest were of the same mind even the sheriff joining in with them
as pettibone voiced his agreement with his com panions he flashed guy a meaning glance and the quirt flew awkwardly from his hand
dismount ing the sheriff led his horse aside and bent to pick up the whip
this made a breach in the cordon that sur rounded the young man and left the road for the moment clear before him
in a trice he inter preted look and dug his heels into his horses sides
the animal sprang away like a shaft from a bow
stop roared pinney but he might as well have ordered the wind to cease blowing
stop or shoot shouted leffingwell draw ing a revolver from his pocket and sighting it quickly
still guy did not halt and pettibone knocked the liverymans arm downward before he could fire
the first victim i none of that leffingwell cried the sheriff
chase after him thats the thing to do
thereupon the six of them had recourse to their spurs and quirts
the horses of the pursuers had seen hard ser vice that morning and were at a disadvantage mount on the contrary was comparatively fresh and he could see by the hasty glances which he occasionally threw over his shoulder that he was slowly increasing the distance that separated him from those behind
there was a point where the road forked one branch leading on to amityville and the other turning sharply in the direction of harmony
pursued and pursuers were drawing close to this point attention was taken up by those behind and pettibone and his companions had eyes for no one but the young man in front
thus it happened that a large contingent of mounted men spurring swiftly along the harmony road failed to capture the notice of those on the other trail
realization was brought suddenly home to the concordians by a terrific yell from the har monyites
pettibone and his friends drew rein panicstricken and whirled to flee
capt blue was coming at the head of his in vincibles a score at least and the sun shimmered upon the polished gun barrels that lay across their saddles
guy was between two fires
as it made little his friend the enemy difference to him which way he went he kept straight on
he saw several of the invincibles raise their guns to their shoulders
instantly he threw up his hand shoot he cried thinking the weapons were aimed at him unarmed at that precise juncture a report came from be hind him and a bullet sang past his ear
he turned in his saddle to launch a threat and a warning at pettibone and his men and just as he did so a spiteful volley leaped from the muzzles of the levelled guns ahead
guy felt a sharp sting in his side as though a knifepoint had pricked him
stop shooting he cried again and the quiv ering impotence of his voice amazed him
stop shooting or youll kill somebody he had in tended to make the shout a lusty one but it was scarcely more than a whisper
everything in his line of vision began to reel
the horsemen in front became tangled in a maze
he raised himself in his stirrups pressed both hands over the burning spot in his side and then pitched head foremost from his saddle
on the night col keever guarded the county records he took with him into the courthouse a winchester rifle and a pint flask
kentucky born and bred it is to be presumed that he was as familiar with one of these weapons as he was with the other
be that as it may however it is cer tain that he fortified his courage to such an ex tent that he slept soundly throughout all the operations connected with the moving of the building
so level was the road leading from the court house site in concord to the vacant square in harmony and so skilfully did the enemy work that col keever if he realized anything at all could only think that the storm was most furious and that this halffinished structure was sadly in need of underpinning
a picture he presented to capt blue and his invincibles who did the work connected with the moving
in the light of an occasional lightning flash the colonel could be viewed at leisure by any one who wished to walk along beside the solitary window and peer into the his friend the enemy single unfinished room which the building con tained
the great man was lying upon a cot in such a way as to reveal the noble proportions of his platonic brow
under the cot was the tin box containing the precious records and close beside the cot lay the empty flask
the pillow partly covered the rifle only the stock and muzzle of the weapon being in evidence
as the colonel slept he smiledsmiled condescendingly in that superior manner which was a part of him
he was dreaming dreams no doubt and pleasant it was late in the morning when the awakening came
the rain had ceased the clouds had dis pelled and a burst of june sun trailed in through an eastern window
the colonel stirred restlessly opened his eyes and yawned
the melancholy gaze he vouchsafed the empty flask changed to a look of pride as his eyes took in the box of records all intact
it would have taken an army corps to separate him from those documents
suddenly a startling thought darted through his brain and he jerked spasmodically and blinked in his bewilderment
then he lay quite still thinking
what business had the morning sun shining through a western window
the court house at the present stage had only one glazed opening and nothing but a blank wall on its eastern side
what did this mean
the colonel rubbed his forehead
was it possible that he had suaviter in modo slept into the afternoon and that the sun was descending instead of rising
he got up and hur riedly dressed himself
then he walked to the window
merciful powers there were iron bars across the outside of it
the mystery deepened
as he stood there staring lo the face of dingle of the hated dingle appeared and looked in at him
the colonel staggered against the wall and caught his head in his hands
was this a hideous dream or was it reality
dingle remained at the window but spoke no word
all he did was to grin in a sarcastic way and draw the lid partly down over his glass eye
that halfwink broke the spell
with a roar the colonel rushed to the cot and caught up the winchester
villain l he cried tossing the gun to his shoul der
your insolence has overshot the mark you have dared to come into this town again and this time got you
egad well teach you a lesson now that you wonot soon forget
once more dingle drew down the left eyelid
the winchester seemed to have no terrors for him and the fury passed all bounds
he pulled the triggernot with the intention to slay but merely to frighten and to arouse the town
there was a sharp click but no report
the colonel pumped the lever and tried again but with like result
then dingle found his tongue excite yourself keever said he
his friend the enemy capt blue unloaded the magazine of that gun last night
gad yelled the colonel
blue is here too is he
and he came in on me last night and tampered with my rifle its strongest
he lifted his voice to up concordians hello
hey
the enemy the enemy l as he finished he hurled the winchester at dingle and the resonant call ended in a crash of glass
keever sprang to the door
the key had been removed from the inside of the lock and the door did not respond to his furious pull
he hurled himself upon it and struggled like a demon
so furious was the onslaught that the knob came away and the great man was precipitated to the floor
a laugh floated in from the window
gain ing his feet after an elephantine tussle he braced himself in a corner and turned his gleaming eyes upon the barred opening
dingle had been joined by others whose heads were crowded together in the narrow space and when the colonel had recognized capt blue mr boomer major harp vlandingham barney and a few more his brain became dizzy and he staggered to the cot
dropping down there he buried his face in his hands
had it come to this
was he finally bewitched by the spirits of kentucky bourbon
he had been a hard drinker all his life but so had his father been before him and he had died in his ninetieth year of a palsy
rising on the cot the suaviter in modo colonel brought an impulsive heel down on the empty flask donot know who you are or where i am he said hoarsely peering at the grinning faces in the window but if theres a doctor among you send him to me going must be
eat this and youll feel better said barney pushing through the bars a pasteboard box filled with eatables
the colonel got up and walked unsteadily across the room
liscomb he murmured step up to the office and tell sampson i want him
step up exclaimed barney quite a step miles if its a foot in harmony donot you know that
harmony l gasped the colonel how can that be
well drawled capt blue we moved the whole shebang over last night during the storm
as you happened to be inside we brought you along
that took the wind completely out of the col onels sails
very humbly he received the box of luncheon out of hands went back to the cot turned his face from the crowd and sat down
he ate the food and as he ate he reflected
here was a masterstroke indeed beside this that affair of the weathervane paled into utter insignificance
the colonel had known all along that harmony was meditating some coup
it was his friend the enemy for the purpose of discovering what this was that he had prevailed upon guy to come to harmony and attend the town meeting
although the theft of the weathervane had chagrined the colonel it had lulled his suspicions for he believed that that had been the contemplated stroke
what an awakening he now had the records were stolen the courthouse was stolen and he himself had been carried along with the rest of the plunder
during that forenoon all harmony came to look into the concord courthouse and gloat over the prisoner
citizens male and female young and old felicitated themselves and cried uncharit able things at the crushed and melancholy man who had been the head and front of all offending against them
the colonel kept his back to the window held his peace in the face of great provo cation and waited patiently to learn what was to be done with him
the afternoon was marked by a dearth of curi osity seekers
no one came to the window and it was possible for the prisoner to rise and pace the room without running a gauntlet of scoffs and gibes
while he was thus wandering about his prison the key scraped in the lock and the other half of the knobwhich had fallen outsidewas thrust through the mechanism
the catch was turned the door opened and isaac dingle stepped fearlessly in
keever rushed at him like a whirl wind but halted in trepidation at sight of a quickly displayed revolver
by a chance col suaviter in modo natural eye and its artificial counterpart were both fixed on the prisoner
careful warned the rival editor have not come here in anger col keever but as a messenger of peace
i wish to ask you to let bygones be bygones
the wheel of fortune has turned against you but we are both editors and the art preservative is the tie that should bind us in good fellowship
i am here to extend a frater nal hand and a helpful one
shall we bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe of peace
col keever was astounded
there must be an ulterior purpose back of this show of friendliness
that was certain
it was equally certain to mind that he had everything to gain and nothing to lose by meeting dingle half way in these amicable overtures
as dingle switched his revolver to his left hand he extended his right col keever grasping it with great show of cor diality
it is not my nature sir said the great man to cherish animosity
true you behold me now at the depth of my fortunes but always and ever you will find me suaviter in modo fortiter in re
no one could say a fine thing more finely and this delicate bit culled by the colonel from the back of his dictionary in a leisure hour was ren dered with a voice and gesture that brought ad miration into eyeseven the glass eye
the little man put away his revolver and they both took seats on the cot
17o his friend the enemy the uncomplaining manner in which you are bearing this reverse said dingle has touched me most profoundly can bear as well as forbear returned col keever see you can colonel and its that which shows your inherent nobility
you are not the only concord man whom the harmony people have in their midst
being of the old school col dingle clung to some of its platitudes
another of your fellow townsmen has experienced the misfortunes of war
another concordian in this town exclaimed keever
not in town exactly but out at and being cared for by one of our men
to whom do you refer
to mr guy herbert
he is not a concord man sir he inclines more towards harmony than towards his own town
what do you mean by that
every samson has his delilah was the others gloomy and significant response
herbert has deserted to you
no some of your people chased him out of concord and pursued him into a company of har monyites
shots were fired
mr herbert was hit hit not killed
no no just wounded thats all
but isnot that enough
the affair might have been in suaviter in modo finitely worse
if any one gets killed during this squabble the governor of the territory will take a hand and it will go hard with all of us
miss vlandingham saw the shooting this morning and when herbert dropped from his horse she rode up to him dismounted in a twinkling and raised his head
she was pale as death and how she did lecture us
she would have no violence no blood shed she declared and she would have something to say to all of us after mr herbert had been attended to
the something she had on her mind was spoken only a little while ago and to nearly every man in of us having been sum moned to her fathers house for the purpose
i canot tell you all she said but reconciliation is the order of the day
the fight for the countyseat is to continue just as vigorously but if it can pos sibly be miss vlandingham desires that the strug gle for supremacy shall be a goodnatured one
it canot be declared keever so long as you have the courthouse a young womans dream thats what it is an unsubstantial fancy
matters in this town however are run about as miss vlandingham de sires
we wouldnot give up this courthouse though even if she should order us to do so
then the bitterness will continue sir mark my words
with me that was a foregone conclusion
nevertheless i was told off by miss vlandingham to inaugurate her new policy
i have reconciled his friend the enemy myself with you and am now to drive you back to concord or as near concord as i dare to go am free asked col keever
you are
my horse and gig are out in front
do i take the records back with me
you do not
col keever sighed
in accepting my liberty at your hands said he understand that i make no promises
that is understood
miss vlandingham pre sents her compliments however and hopes that you will persuade your fellow citizens to accept the olive branch which she holds out to them on be half of harmony
when miss vlandingham sends the olive branch to concord nailed to the courthouse i give my word it will be accepted
this from col keever with dignity
dingle wagged his head decidedly and led the way out of the building
two minutes later the redwheeled gig was making record time in the direction of concord
of all lifes mysteries the mystery of pain is the most profound and baffling
men on a battlefield have been wounded most horribly and have yet thought at the first of it that they were injured only slightly if at all
it was so with guy
when the bullet entered his side his suffering was no more than would have come from a pinprick and great was his surprise to feel the quick weakness the sudden sapping of his strength the dizzy whirl of every thing about him
as he plunged headlong to the ground the darkness closed in and left not the faintest ray of reason
this hiatus was not of long duration and for some time before he opened his eyes he was con scious of a gentle forward motion as though he was being carried
voices were borne to him too the sturdy voices of men mingling with another soft and musical in spite of its undertone of in dignation and reproof
the softer voice thrilled him to his hearts core
he did not mind the pain so much although it was steady and intense
the realization that miss betty was near was as a balm to him body and soul
looking out from i his friend the enemy between his partly opened lids he discovered that he was being carried on a blanket by six men
others of the company rode and led the horses of those who were acting as bearers
a little to the left was capt blue miss betty mounted on a fine spirited horse riding at his side
what right had you miss betty was saying to ride out of concord with these armed men
what is your excuse for doing that capt blue
we feared reprisals on account of the court house answered the captain stiffly for to be taken to task by miss betty was sorely against the grain
we were scouting thats all
just scouting
the moment i heard that you had trooped out along the concord road i galloped after you went on miss betty
oh i wish i wish i had come up with you in time to prevent this terrible meeting she looked toward guy poignant regret showing in every line of her fair face
mr herbert would not have been hurt if i had
i have felt all along that something terrible would happen before we secured our rights in this county seat fight
i have tried my best to keep you from violence and you capt blue have disre garded my expressed wish my strongest com mand
who was it fired the shot that wounded mr herbert
the other side fired the first shot replied the captain evasively know that for i was close enough to see it
shack but that shot did no harm and was no excuse for the fusillade which you returned
you were three times the number of the other side and they were fleeing as fast as their horses could carry them
my question was not answered capt blue
can you tell me whose bullet struck mr herbert
no one could tell you that miss vlandingham
a dozen shots were fired simultaneously and it would be impossible to tell which did the work
we will inquire into that later
i am going to push on so as to have the doctor at our house and to make ready for mr herbert
see that you bring him as quickly and as easily as you can
she darted from the side at top speed and was quickly lost to sight
how is he getting along asked capt blue riding close to the men who were carrying guy
he hasnot flicked an eyelid replied barney who was one of the six and who imagined that he had been watching guy very closely mistaken barney spoke up guy his eyes wide open
how do you feel herbert inquired the captain in tones of great relief
as well as can be expected captain
guy lifted himself slightly and saw that his coat and vest were unbuttoned and that tight across his wound and over his bloodstained shirt had been bound a scarf of silk
whose house is that over there he asked pointing
his friend the enemy sile place answered the captain
take me there please said guy dropping back on the blanket got orders to carry you to harmony to the returned the captain
it seems to me that i am the one who ought to be consulted murmured guy weakly
he was in much pain but he could probably have weathered out the longer journey to the had circumstances been different
just now he preferred any other haven than willowview
see here herbert demurred the captain his brow wrinkled perplexedly miss vlandingham has gone on to make things ready for your recep tion at the house going to have a doctor there too
if i donot bring you be raked over the coals and i think had more than my share of that already
put yourself in my place canot you
put yourself in mine captain said guy his eyes closing and his face twitching with pain
the captain felt that he understood then
her bert was not able to be carried farther than whit takers
major said the captain to a man who reared above the saddle like don quixote over the back of rozinante ride on to the and tell miss betty that herbert gave out and we couldnot get him past bring the doctor post haste
shack correct was the response which the major shook out of himself
relinquishing to a companion the horse he was leading he rattled his spurs and was off at speed
only a few minutes were required to carry guy to shack
whittaker was a bachelor and immediately came forth to meet the invincibles
who you got there blue he asked nodding his head towards guy wounded man whittaker heard shootin off south a spell ago did he get in the way of it
yes
we had orders to take him on to the but he doesnot feel able to travel any farther
will you take him in
not if hes one of your folks blustered whit taker whose house was just then on the concord side of his farm
well hes a concord man said the captain grimly
all right then
sile whittaker is with the under dog every time and if hes from concord hes welcome to the best got
bring him in bring him right in
sile shack was small and its furni ture what there was of it was very primitive but the young man could not have been made more welcome had the house been a palace and sile whittaker a grandee
after seeing that guy was as comfortable as possible capt blue and his invincibles galloped i his friend the enemy away leaving barney behind to be of what as sistance he could
they had not been gone long before miss betty came accompanied by her father and a sober appearing gentleman who carried a medicine case under his arm
miss betty was first in the room where guy lay
are you better mr herbert she asked halt ing beside the bed and looking down at him shall do well enough miss vlandingham thank you answered guy hope so she said formally after bending her blue eyes on him for a space
then she turned to her father and his companion who were just entering
mr herbert says he thinks he will get along all right father she added
glad to hear that responded squire vlan dingham heartily
stepping up to the bed he reached down and pressed hand sorry confoundedly sorry this has happened herbert he went on
our people were getting carried away but i guess this little incident will bring them up with a round turn
too bad though that you had to be the victim
vlan dingham addressed himself to the man who had entered the room with him
dr larkin this is mr herbert
please tell us what you think of his wound
if one might judge from the way he went about his work dr larkin knew his business thor oughly
shack worth a dozen dead men mr herbert he smiled turning away to open his medicine case and draw out some lint and bandages and a polished probe have to lie still for a few days and take life quietly for some time after you get up and around
he laid the lint and ban dages to one side and drew a chair close to the bedside going to hurt you now he re sumed leaning over know exactly where that bullet is and its got to come out you know
go ahead said guy
the doctor went ahead with a vengeance
his bright probe sank into the wound the blood flowed afresh and guy stiffened out as he lay ground his teeth together and clutched the side of the bed with his fingers
miss betty voiced a little cry and left the room
in a short time the doctor raised up with his ensanguined instrument in his hand and dropped the bullet on a table that had been placed at his elbow
good for you herbert he exclaimed
that is about as painful a thing as a doctor can do to a man
he never groaned once murmured the admir ing barney who had come in with sile whittaker all right mr herbert averred whit taker couldnot have stood it better myself
the wound was then dressed and guy thankful to have the ordeal over released his tense muscles and fell back white trembling and numb with the shock
18o his friend the enemy a concord man with harmony grit herbert smiled vlandingham
his daughter reappeared just in time to hear the words
coming near the bed she pushed her hand through her fathers arm and directed her blue eyes at guy
he returned her gaze steadily
did he read sympathy in her look
and was there nothing else in it but sympathy
he was no weakling and never had been
he did not want pity from any one especially from this fair girl whom heloved for some time he had hesi tated to acknowledge in his own heart the depth of his esteem for miss betty
their meetings had been few and for the most part under stress of peril to one or the other
and behold this was first experience with the tender passion a first love springs like minerva from the head of zeus or better still like aphrodite from the sea
these callow beginnings of the old old tale are for the most part as substantial as a childs bubble just about yet occasionally be it known men and women have ideals and will strike their colors the very moment the ideal comes into their lives
guy had met his ideal and had surrendered his heart
he was not doubtful of himself if he had any doubt at all it was of miss betty
all at once he remembered the happenings at lake eliza beth and of the sorry plight in which they had left him in miss mind
when he began to talk with the view of leading up to an explana tion he was frowned down by the doctor
shack i converse interrupted the medical gentle man move either
simply lie as com fortably as you can and rest come out and see you again this evening
closing his medicine case with a decisive snap the doctor tucked it under his arm and went out
as soon as you can mr herbert said miss betty you are to come to willowview shall do well enough here miss vlanding ham returned guy but i thank you for the invitation
people must not say that the harmony people almost killed a concordian and then left him to shift for himself in a bare little shack like this
sile whittaker had left the room with the doctor or miss betty would never have made this remark
this shack will answer the pur pose very well answered guy
it nettled him to be referred to in such a generic manner
by jove interposed the squire when youre able to come to willowview youre going to come even if i have to order out the invincibles
miss betty turned on her father in a flash
the invincibles have already had their orders to disband she exclaimed they worked mischief enough
from now on i shall do my utmost to conciliate the concord people and you are to help me father
i have a plan which we will discuss on our way back
the squire cast a halfhumorous glance at guy and bowed humbly
his friend the enemy of course betty of course said he and they started out
before she had reached the door miss betty halted and faced guy once more
you will hear from us again mr herbert she observed
barney will stay here to help care for you
you are very considerate said guy but i can manage to struggle along without barney
nevertheless he stays declared the squire my boy for the present
they left at once and miss betty did not give the young man a parting word a backward glance or even a smile
guy thought of this gloomily for naturally he could not know how absorbed miss betty had become in the plan she had suddenly evolved and which she was going to talk over with her father
this plan had to do with the policy of reconciliation and with the re lease of col keever
the latter as miss betty was planning the matter should be released and presented with an olive branch for delivery to the people of concord
guy heard the hoofbeats of the horses die sod denly away in the distance and he imagined that even so was miss betty passing out of his life
he would lose her and he would lose the countyseat
before his vision passed a host of migratory structures stores and dwellings mounted upon broadtired wheels and drawn by innumerable teams of horses
col keever was on the roof of shack the blizzard building spyglass in hand laying the course for the long caravan that bobbed behind
pettibone and little alec drove their own domicile with the high stepper between the shafts and as this home drifted past the sheriff winked deri sively
one by one the buildings rolled by in dreamy review and the spot where concord had been was desolated as by some comprehensive cyclone
guy saw himself forlorn and utterly alone wandering among his vacant lots bewailing the loss of the countyseat and of the girl he loved and then merciful oblivion blotted out the vision and he slept dreamlessly and the slumber did him more good than all the medicines in the world
for a week after guy had taken refuge at sile nothing of moment happened
the doctor called regularly and squire vlandingham oc casionally came with him
the squire was at all times his jovial self although guy fancied that an undercurrent of restraint permeated his good nature at times
during those seven days the young man neither saw nor heard anything of miss betty
her father avoided mention of herstudiously as guy imaginedand pride restrained the inquiries which guy often had at the end of his tongue
this reticence and seeming neglect hurt him for he yearned to set miss betty right concerning that fateful meeting on the shore of lake eliza beth
while guy fretted much over the devious course his true love was taking yet this did not interfere with his rapid improvement
the following saturday found him able to sit up and walk with a cane about the house and out of doors where whittaker always had a com fortable chair ready in the shade of the house
i his friend the enemy barney was gone by this time and whittaker himself was attending to the wants of his guest
on this particular saturday two incidents oc curred which effectually relieved the tedium of convalescence and changed the character of his thoughts concerning miss betty
the first of these incidents had to do with abe landy of amityville
mr landy was a cousin of sile and drove over regularly once a week to argue the political question
mr landy was a florid man with a fringe of carroty whiskers about his plump face
he had been a miner in the coal regions of pennsylvania before he came to dakota whittaker explained to the young man and always acted as though he was delvin for somethin in the dark
guy and whittaker were seated out of doors when mr landy drove up in his twowheeled cart
howdy sile said mr landy
same to you abe answered whittaker
came over to see if you werenot about ready to live on the other side of the farm sile
if thats all you came for donot stop just keep movin
no sir said landy jumping down and tying his horse think too much of you sile to abandon you to your foolishness
landy came forward was introduced to guy and another chair was brought from the house
in vain did whittaker seek to divert the conversa tion to the weather the crops the doings of the mr landy of amityville territorial legislature or what not landy al ways swerved back to the countyseat question
the work laid out for myself observed landy is winnin you over to vote for har mony
election day is comin sile and i donot want you to throw away your vote the worst man i ever see to stick and hang returned whittaker petulantly
if going to throw away my vote by casting it for concord what do you care donot want to see you do a thing youll be sorry for
look here proceeded landy growing confidential vote for harmony and see that you get three good lots for doing it
did vlandingham send you to me
not exactly but got an understanding with him a pointer for you mr herbert said whittaker winking at guy you know abe he added addressing his cousin that mr herbert is a concord man
heard he was replied landy nibbling at a plug of tobacco see that he gets three lots too if hell only vote for harmony
guy smiled
why said he got about twelve hundred lots in concord mr landy
so told responded the unruffled landy
but the hull twelve hundred wonot be worth three harmony lots after the election donot think i can accept your offer even if i his friend the enemy that is a fair statement of the case
just then guy had a bright thought
there are thirty five voters in amityville landy he asked arenot there mr fifteen corrected landy and i carry every vote in my pocket
the population of the village is thirtyfive countin men women and children
how many harmony lots did squire vlanding ham give you for turning these votes to his side
landy jumped
what makes you think he gave me any he asked warily sure he did
he must have given you a good many it strikes me for amityville is the key to the situation right about our town being the key to the situation
our votes will settle the county seat businessno doubt about that
now i should think resumed guy that squire vlandingham gave you a whole block in return for the amityville vote block gasped landy
yes or more
why if i had a block of harmony lots be independent rich as soon as the countyseat ques tion is settled and the boom sets in
your influence would be worth it you get a block
no nor half a block
i only got six and was given two to transfer to every voter in amity ville
mr landy of amityville you donot say so exclaimed guy
is it possible that that is squire idea of fair treatment
only six lots for gaining the countyseat for harmony well well
guy leaned back in his chair and looked at landy sympathetically
vlandingham has pulled the wool over your eyes abe chuckled whittaker making due note of his cousins long face
it doesnot look as though he had treated me just right does it now mumbled landy
no sir said guy with emphasis
did you make a straight bargain with squire vlanding ham there wasnot any bargain at all
when vlan dingham got ready to have his petition to the county commissioners signed he handed me a due bill for six lots together with fourteen other due bills for two lots each for the rest of the voters in amityville
all he did was to slap me on the back and call me abe and say how much he thought of me
gosh
and to think that he was making game of me all the time
it is too bad mr landy rejoined guy
for some time he had been furtively taking mr measure and he was now ready to lay on the finishing stroke of a hastily evolved plan
if amityville votes for concord he went on almost a certainty that concord will win
when it is once settled that concord has the countyseat hard and fast the town will boom his friend the enemy i 9o and lots will sell like hot cakes
as i told you i have over twelve hundred good lots and i wouldnot object to giving thirtyfour due bills for two lots each to every man woman and child in amityville excepting abraham landy
as for mr landy i would ask him to distribute the thirtyfour due bills and then if he would promise to return a solid vote for concord i would give him a thirtyfifth due bill for fifty lots two full blocks do that would you exploded landy leaping from his chair would answered guy and i would con sider that mr landy had done me a favor
mr landy clasped his hands behind him and walked around the house his eyes turned ground ward hooked him muttered the delighted whittaker
by jinks youve hooked him mr herbert
and whittaker was right
ten minutes later guy was writing due bills by the dozen and half an hour later mr landy was homeward bound after having given a written agreement to poll every amityville ballot for concord
while he was engaged in giving away lots guy did not forget to present whittaker with half a dozen thereupon that gentleman solemnly covenanted that his house should remain forever upon the concord side of his farm
this deal consummated guy went in and laid mr landy of amityville i down
he felt that he had done a good stroke of work for concord
his conscience troubled him somewhat for there was a hint of sharp practice in his deal with landy that was directly opposed to the young mans inclinations and general character
still if vlandingham had bought ami tyville signatures to his petition why should not guy buy amityville votes
the ballots of the two sets of imported voters each just a score in number would nullify each other
now that ami tyville was to go for concord the success of concord seemed certain
the first flush of assured victory over guy be gan to feel sorry for miss betty
she was bending every effort towards winning a victory for har mony and was so confident of the result that hewell he almost regretted that he had allowed him self to purchase mr influence
lady to see you mr herbert announced whittaker abruptly opening the door
after grin ning slyly he vanished as quickly as he had ap peared lady murmured guy in trepidation
he had been so busy with his thoughts that he had heard no sounds indicative of the arrival of a visitor
as he arose he glanced through a win dow and saw miss pinkney seated in a gorgeous trap and holding a horse
the next moment he saw whittaker approach the trap stand beside it and engage miss pinkney in conversation
the young mans heart fluttered
at last
at last i his friend the enemy he would be able to explain that affair on the lake shore
miss betty was waiting for him when he entered the other room
she came forward hastily and took one of his hands in both her own
the look on her face was one which he had never seen there before
sadness heartburning regretthese were all in the glance she gave him can remain but a moment mr herbert she said have been in bismarck for a few days and on my return to harmony i learned some thing which has brought me straight to you to ask your forgiveness
my forgiveness he repeated clinging to one of her hands
forgiveness for what
for allowing you to help me thus causing you to be looked upon as a traitor by your own townspeople and for daring to think that you had brought the sheriff and two others with you to the lake a week ago last wednesday
oh i feel as though i am personally culpable and that your wound is the indirect result of my own actions
her blue eyes grew misty and her voice shook
will you forgive me mr herbert
he longed to clasp her to his breast and tell her how dear she had become to him in the brief time they had known each other he would have given worlds to kiss her tears away and do other senti mental and foolish things which he had no earthly right to do but he restrained himself
he loved her and he defied the months and years to dis mr landy of amityville i prove a truth which two short weeks had made clear to him
yet while sure of his own feelings he must wait to assure himself of hers
who has told you my side of the case miss vlandingham he asked
some one who knows was the reply some one who lives in concord and is thoroughly con versant with every phase of your illtreatment at the hands of the mistaken people there
my illtreatment i fear has been overdrawn said guy smiling love the study of my fellow man miss vlandingham and although i have been put to some inconvenience while in concord i assure you that i have had a great deal of en joyment out of the situation existing there
in trying times like these human nature flies to the surface and that makes the study of character not only easy but delightful
i am glad however that you know i was not at fault when i met you at the lake
did you hear of my telegram
yes i know of that
col keever told the operator that you had decided not to send it
and it was simply a coincidence that caused you to appoint for our meeting the very place day and hour that was hit upon by col keever and col dingle for their affair of honor coincidence entirely
you will forgive me will you not and forget my hasty words at the lake
please hurry for i must be going forgive you freely although i do not see how you could have acted otherwise than as you did
his friend the enemy your generosity prompts you to say that
but you must not be too generous
for instance i would not want you to think that you must not strain every effort to win the countyseat con test
it is a case of greek meeting greek you know and all is fair in war and love added guy
the color flew to her face like to see a man successful she added even if he is fighting against me have done and shall continue to do every thing i can to keep the countyseat at concord averred guy
there she exclaimed like to hear you say that and in just that tone of voice
it sounds businesslike and manly you know and thats the way i like to hear peoplesome peoplethat is people in whom i take an interest what am i saying
she bit her lip in vexation and stamped her foot
please let me go she said attempt ing to withdraw her hand
he raised the gloved hand to his lips
again the scarlet flew to her cheeks and she turned and fled from the house
the election was to be held on tuesday and the monday preceding had been fraught with matters of grave concern for col keever
the most mo mentous of these matters was the strike of samp son for back pay and higher wages the most momentous because like the newly started snow ball the incident grew amazingly in importance until it ended in the disgrace his ban ishment from the town and the wrecking of the blizzard
to begin with the blizzard had never been much of a financial success
it was a paper of johnsonian excellence that is to say so ponder ous in its utterance that it had to be read with a ones elbow
the little fishes talked like whales on every line and through every column
in a community necessarily defi cient in its supply of websters the blizzard was venerated and feared because of its evident learn ing
for the same reason but few subscribed for it and so small was the subscription list at the time the unfeeling sampson went on strike and his friend the enemy so meagre was the advertising patronage that the colonel had barely two dollars that he could call his own
in his extremity he bewailed the reckless impulse which had led him to pay hepburn the discharged section hand from harmony twenty dollars for information which had proved of no value
the great man dreamed of that twentydollar bill in his sleep and would clutch at it so fiercely that he would awakeawake to realize that it was gone forever
his printing plant had cost him five hundred dollars and he had paid all but four hundred and fifty dollars of that debt
he had no lots in concord and if guy had demanded a settlement it would have been found that there were fifty or more which could not be accounted for
that very monday pedro smith had pressed the col onel for a board bill long past due the news company had sent his patent outsides by ex press covering certain arrearagesand the bundle was still in the express office while the forms waited in vain on the army press
what was the colonel to do
racked with all these worries he had entered his office only to be confronted by sampson who demanded money and declared he would stop work if he didnot get it
this was the last straw
the patience gave way and hot words were passed between him and his printer
and thenwell he struck samp four gentlemen from harmony son with his cane and sampson hit him with a chair and threw him into one corner and shook a fist in his face and vowed revenge rrrevenge
after that sampson went away in high dudgeon and the colonel picked himself up limped to his office chair and sat there for a long long time bitterly reflecting
the sun went down the shad ows of evening fell and still the acute mind had found no loophole for escape from his present difficulties
it was at this juncture that four gentlemen from harmony all of serious aspect and wearing black slouch hats ascended the unsteady stairs that led to the office of the blizzard
and one was very tall and one had a glass eye and the third stumped through life on a wooden pin and the fourth carried an empty sleeve
business called them to concord and illfortune had prepared the colonel to greet them in receptive mood
the committee of ways and ways and questionable meanscame at night as befitted doers of ignoble deeds
their twoseated carriage and team were left at the edge of town and they were unseen by any save sampson
he still car ried a key to the workroom and as they entered by the front he entered at the rear
col keever cherished no illfeelings and wel comed his callers cordially and humorously
should he put their names down for a years sub scription to his invaluable paper twofifty a year in advance
his friend the enemy no the four gentlemen from harmony had not called for any such purpose
indeed
while his four callers were unfortunate in so far as they resided in a town with such a poor outlook as harmony yet lack of taste was not a crime and col keever was glad to extend the right hand of fellowship to col dingle maj
harp capt blue and mr boomer
col dingle maj
harp capt blue and mr boomer gratefully acknowledged col amicable sentiments and begged to assure him of their own coupled with a slight offering in the way of liquid refreshment
this preliminary matter arranged to the voluble satisfaction of all parties col dingle asked to know if they were alone
col keever told him that they could not be more utterly alone if they were set down on the broad bosom of the nothing to drink
then they all laughed and clapped the great man on the back and seemed to think it an excel lent joke and col keever became bland and facetious and informed them again of his ever lasting regard
following this mr boomer went to the door and looked out on the landing and down the stairs and came back seemingly satisfied
all clear colonel he said and col dingle hitched his chair into confidential proximity to col four gentlemen from harmony colonel he observed carefully concord is the countyseat of goodwill county
col keever replied that he had no reason to dispute his honorable friends statement
he concurred in it fully
colonel went on dingle harmony would like to have the countyseat
keever averred loudly in answer to this re mark that col dingle was a truthful man and a man of undoubted ability
they had had their little differences of course yet col keever knew how to grant honor where honor was due
when it rained col dingle knew where to go to keep out of the wet
dingle laughed his natural eye glowed and he nudged keever with his elbow
the other three gentlemen joined in the merriment liquid refresh ment was again bountifully administered and the good feeling prevailed to an extent that was al most morbid
dingle hung languishingly on shoulder while the three others huddled about anxious to laugh at any joke however old and silently im ploring an opportunity to express their unbounded affection for everybody special election has been called for the pur pose of shifting the countyseat from concord to harmony dingle resumed and a twothirds vote is necessary to the consummation of such a change
now it is impossible to deny that har mony is a favorite with twothirds of the county his friend the enemy but designated himself and his three understand how ut terly vain it would be for harmony to attempt to secure the countyseat without the good will and assistance of one whose ability is undoubted whose virtues are the envy of his fellow men and whose congenial nature is a theme of general re mark
in short col archibald keever of con cord
col keever smiled his gratification and desired to state that it had never been his extreme good fortune to run across so truthful a man as col dingle nor such a wholesouled appreciative set of companions as had accompanied him and he hoped that knowing him as they all did they would take this little apostrophe for what it was worth
in the meantime as the national debt was oppressive why not give it another lift
the four gentlemen from harmony readily un derstood this hint and four flasks were stretched out simultaneously towards col keever
the latter bowed and to the end that none might feel aggrieved paid due and lengthened attention to each flask supplementing each draught with a peculiarly happy remark relative to the generosity of the donor and the excellence of his gift
this small formality over col dingle once more resumed his topic in a voice that was growing husky by very apparent degrees
col keever you have managed the townsite of concord and managed it well
among other four gentlemen from harmony things you have gone ahead like an able tactician and have rushed into this precinct certain men to build bridges and houses and repair roads and heaven knows what
now everybody is aware that the roads are all right the bridges in good condition and that you have more houses than you can use
well then why have you brought all these men here
oh we know that fertile brain that intellect that labored and brought forth the blizzard has hidden its purpose well but we have discovered it we boys
we have came a chorus of thick voices
col keever wore a perpetual smile very child like very bland and he would wink his right eye now and then and shake his head with a great deal of feeling the purpose he inquired evincing a tendency to run his words together this
that special election is called for to morrow
these men will have been in the county sixty days and in the precinct twenty days con sequently they can vote and naturally theyll vote for concord wonder much remarked keever with a dry hiccough
twenty men and i pay em two dollars a day for sixty twentyfour hundred dollars that it costs us to save the countyseat
and whos to the fore in the enterprise
col archibald keever i declare gentlemen my throat is parched
would it be asking too much his friend the enemy it was not asking too much
col keever was welcome to the best they had in the shop and all there was of it
and this brings us back to where we started said col dingle
harmony would like the county seat and she would like it just two thou sand dollars worth
dingle gave keever a playful push that murmured keever rolling his eyes
just this went on dingle
instead of vot ing these men for concord vote them for har mony
you can do it
the great mind that built up a paper like the blizzard can do anything
col keever relapsed into silence and did his best to think calmly while the four gentlemen from harmony awaited his reply in soulful expecta tion
two thousand asked keever huskily
two thousand came an equally husky reply
cash down
fifty now and nineteen hundred and fifty when the votes are polled
a long period of silence ensued to be finally broken by keever with the anxious query gen1 men is there any left
there was some left and libations were renewed all around
what is it colonel yes or no asked dingle when the gurgling period was over
through col mind there flitted hazily four gentlemen from harmony the following items four hundred and fifty on account of plant twentyeight sixty to get that weeks issue out of pawn sixty some odd for sampson and there was no knowing the amount of pedro bill
why not
he coughed looked around him a trifle ner vously and then held out his hand the fifty
a crisp bank note was tendered him
here you are said dingle and here are two documentsmere matters of form you know one for us and one for yousetting forth whats to be done whats to be paid and when
for your protection as well as ours colonel
sign there
unsteadily the editor took up his pen and scrawled two awkward signatures whereupon col dingle signed below him and the other three at tested the act as witnesses
then after drinking the last of the liquor the four gentlemen from harmony bade col keever an affectionate goo bye and left
col keever heard capt blue fall down the full length of the stairs heard col dingle whoop joyously and maj
harp tune himself into a discord faintly suggestive of we go home till morning and then these sounds died away and all was still
further and further the head bowed forward until no longer able to retain his seat he fell under the desk and lay there a melancholy example of fallen greatness
his friend the enemy at that moment the door leading into the work room opened softly and sampson a cunning grin on his freckled face tiptoed into the sanctum my turn now colonel he muttered be tween his teeth as he looked down on the sprawled out form of his former employer
stooping over he removed the crisp bank note from the vest pocket
you owe me something like sixty five dollars but apply this on account
and put this in my pocket too he added taking from the desk the paper that had just been signed tramp printer isnot the man to be fooled with colonel and youll understand this before i am done with you
with that sampson shook his fist at the col onel and strode from the office
meanwhile col dingle maj
harp and capt blue were riding in a lethargic condition while mr boomer who had fallen from the carriage unknown to himself or his compan ions was peacefully sleeping by the roadside some two miles out of concord
it was on monday afternoon that miss betty dashed up to the door of sile shack in the gorgeous trap
a dazzling picture she pre sented to guy with her light dress her fluttering ribbons and her bewitching hat
the ubiquitous miss pinkney was not along and the silverplated harness jingled rare music as miss betty drew to a halt
mr whittaker had gone off to attend to some farm work and guy was alone at the house
he went out forthwith to greet the young lady and to ask her if she would not alight
oh no said she canot stop
i have come for you mr herbert
for me he echoed
certainly
it was understood that when you were well enough to leave mr you were to come to willowview you remem ber
that was not remembrance of the under standing canot go with you miss vlandingham he murmured confusedly
really his friend the enemy now mr herbert she pouted have driven out here purposely to get you and is it possible that you will refuse to go back with me
there was laughter in her eyes as she added you need apprehend no danger now
a con cord man i am happy to say may walk the streets of harmony without the slightest fear
it isnot the danger that deters me answered guy am not such a coward as that i hope l you well enough
she eyed his stal wart form archly
richard is himself againalmost
but to morrow you know is election day
the returns will reach you more quickly in harmony than they will here shall not stay here
my post of duty is concord and mr whittaker is going to take me there in the morning
from the way the concord people treated you she said her eyes glowing resentfully shouldnot think youd ever want to set foot in the place again
irrespective of the feelings of the concordians he smiled there is my financial interest
i can not abandon those twelve hundred lots
what are twelve hundred or twelve thousand lots to the son of mr montfort herbert she returned mere bagatelle i know perfectly well that it isnot the money at stake in your case nor is it in mine test
it is the excitement of the con she threw back her shoulders and tossed the rigor of the game her fair head stout heart a fair fight and the rigor of the game the end of our plots and our counterplots is now at hand
either success or defeat will prove equally glorious and you can learn the worst or the best at willowview just as well as you can in concord
please donot keep me waiting mr herbert
evidently she thought the son of mr montfort herbert had a competence in his own right
she had not been informed of the real condition of fortunes and he was not the one to lay bare the truth
guy reflected
he might do more harmthan good in concord if he went there during the crisis
he had no vote anyway as two weeks in the territory would not give him the right of franchise
be sides had he not in a quiet way gained a strate gic advantage which would keep the countyseat at concord
very well miss vlandingham he said
it is kind of you to come for me and if you really care for my company at willowview i shall be most happy to return with you
he went into the house for his satchel and they started for harmony with a snap of the whip and a jingle of chains
very shortly they passed mr whittaker at work by the road and there was a brief halt while guy explained matters
mr whit taker said little but smiled in a knowing way and they could see him lean on the handle of his shovel and watch until they were out of sight
his friend the enemy only the pen of a poet could fittingly describe that wondrous ride
a sentimental journey it was every step of the way from to the a delicious faring across the sunny plain through a drowsy odor of wild flowers and under such skies as smile over the fortunate isles
touched by the spell neither of the young people wasted much time in conversation and the long lapses of silence into which they fell were rhythmic intervals wherein their hearts echoed back the melody of a song as old as the days of man
arrived at their destination guy heaved a sigh of regret
the calends of his love had lifted a white stone to mark a passing hour and he was more securely a captive if that could be
the young mans sojourn at willowview was very brief
both miss betty and her father ex erted themselves to the utmost to make his stay enjoyable but he was ill at ease
his negotiations with mr landy had certainly won the county seat for concord and it seemed to him as though he were acting a double part
when the returns came in and when the genial squire and the adorable miss betty discovered how wily and tactful he had been he feared that there would be an upheaval and that they would deny him their hospitality and send him forth in scorn
it was all very well for miss betty to talk of the rigor of the game
the prime incentive in every game is success and when the ballots were counted and it was found that amityville had cast the rigor of the game a deciding vote for concord he would see then whether miss betty would take defeat as glor iously as she would have taken a better fortune
it would be a bitter triumph for him if it cost him her favor
yet if she had not spoken those words in a spirit of railleryin short if she really meant themhow incomparable she would become in his eyes
as pettibone had said he could go to her and offer her a dower interest in his town then if she would accept
and his heart leaped at the thought and his mind winged skyward in sweeping dreams
that night they were in the cozy parlor just as they had been exactly two weeks before
miss betty was at the piano and guy stood beside her turning her music
the squire was engaged with his paper
since the young man had come to the house that second time the countyseat question had not once been mentioned
as during his first visit father and daughter were making it plain that while he was their guest there was to be no discordant note to jar their friendship
guy was delighted at this for there was a charm in observ ing miss betty as the light and center of her fathers home
if her shrewdness and courage had pleased him in the political field how much more was he attracted by her domestic accomplish ments
guy was watching miss white fingers flit over the keys and now and then exchanging a soft word in which his passion throbbed danger his friend the enemy ously near the surface when there came a sudden interruption
a lusty voice outside gave an alarm of fire fire and the squire leaped from his chair as his daughter and guy hastily left the piano
can it be this house father inquired miss betty nervously
no its in town replied the squire who had drawn back the curtain for a quick look at the surroundings canot just make out what build ing it is but its near the square thats evi dent
he ran to the hall secured his hat and opened the door
a mellow glare was cast over the scene without and a man was discovered hastening along the road
hello cried the squire burning
the courthouse was the startling answer flung back by the man as he sped on
oh dear cried miss betty with a sharp note of regret had planned to do something in the morning before the polls opensomething which would have knit concord and harmony in closer bonds and have insured a peaceable election but now it is impossible
the best laid plans of mice and maids gang aft agley you remember observed guy
for my part i hope that illfated courthouse will be burned to the last stick enough
it has caused trouble together they sat on the porch watching the the rigor of the game yellow flames leap high and toss their sparkling starlike cinders
then gradually the fiery tongues sank down and down the glare faded out of the sky and they knew that the courthouse had ceased to be a factor in the contest
the squire returned by and by and with him walked a youth who was wheeling a bicycle
let us go in for a moment they heard the squire say gate
you can leave your wheel at the they entered the house whither miss betty and guy had preceded them and guy then discovered that the youth who was accompanying the squire was none other than lemuel bilkins
notwith standing a certain air of bravado and triumph it could be seen that lemuel was very much agitated and frightened fellow townsman of yours mr herbert remarked the squire a grim smile flitting across his face
this young man he laid his hand on shoulder came over from concord and burned the courthouse
he was caught while attempting to escape and the people were strongly tempted to make an example of him but i re minded them of our new policy of my new policy father interrupted miss betty
quite so my dear
i reminded them of your new policy and the incendiary was turned over to me
his name is lemuel bilkins and he has probably done a brave thing as his people will his friend the enemy look at it
that was a very bright idea of yours mr bilkins
there was sarcasm in the voice but lemuel could not detect it
it was the idea answered lemuel falteringly but proudly
he said if do it i could have place in the office
has sampson left employ queried the squire with sudden interest
why returned lemuel he set on the colonel like a tiger an if the colonel hadnot held himself in hed jest naturally have killed samp
this is news indeed exclaimed guy have brought the young man here betty resumed her father so that you might tell him what you intended doing with the courthouse tomorrow
he will see then that the building was sacrificed to no purpose you sit down mr bilkins asked miss betty ruther stand returned lemuel fidgeting
if its all the same to you ruther go right off too
you are in no danger mr bilkins went on miss betty give you my word
stand if you like for i will detain you only a few moments
the purloining of the courthouse was my plan
i did not intend to steal it but after harmony had legally acquired the countyseat i was going to have the building paid for
had i not done this i hardly see how a clash could have been avoided the rigor of the game for the invincibles were organized and drilled and it was their avowed intention to march upon concord and take the records by force
i had absolutely no power over them
by allowing them to work off their ardor in a more theatrical way their purpose was accomplished without violence
we bear no ill will toward you or your people and i had arranged to have the court house hauled back to its original site in the early hours of the morning
i am very sorry indeed that you have made this impossible
if you will remember what i have told you however and tell your fellow citizens about it they may perhaps accept the intention in lieu of the deed
lem bilkins when the squire conducted him from the house and started him homeward on his bicycle appeared as one stunned
as for guy this fresh proof of miss consummate ability in managing a delicate situation merely increased his admiration for her
next day came the crucial test and the nerves of the entire county were stretched to tightest tension
there was much excitement in harmony and the squire was abroad all day not even re turning home for his luncheon
miss pinkney walked over from the town and awaited the re turns in company with miss betty and guy
great was the consternation of the ladies when barney late in the afternoon arrived with the intelligence that amityville had gone solidly for concord
his friend the enemy why cried miss betty every one of the amity ville people signed the petition for this election l and the squire gave mr landy six lots wailed miss pinkney who was the picture of despair
the squire wasnot liberal enough put in guy looking keenly at miss betty gave mr landy two entire blocks and distributed concord real estate to every man woman and child in amity ville
you did that cried miss betty
you mr herbert
miss pinkney looked daggers at guy when he bowed in answer to her friends question knew all along miss vlandingham said the young man just how amityville would go
that was one reason why i did not want to come here yesterday
i have done what i could for concord and it seems have earned your dis pleasure
earned my displeasure she repeated with a rippling laugh
not a bit of it
you were a foeman worthy of our steel and i am almost as glad you have won as i would have been had harmony achieved the victory
betty l gasped miss pinkney
you are cer tainly beside yourself
do you know what this means to your father to mine to all of us
oh dear dear dear
i canot imagine what we are all going to do and to think that we were all so certain of amityville the rigor of the game that is where the joke comes in exclaimed miss betty
what a surprise this will be for my father certainly won mr herbert
it was very clever and i am proud of your success believe me
allow me to congratulate you
she gave guy her hand
betty cried miss pinkney aa modern tarpeia
the idea of youyou of all othersbeing happy because concord won miss pinkney began drawing on her gloves in an angry flutter
lois returned miss betty you do not un derstand dear
i am not happy because concord won but because mr herbert has come out of the east burdened with his inexperience and worsted a clique of old campaigners like my father and yours
are you proud of me for going into the open market and buying votes asked guy
hush she returned raising an admonitory forefinger
that is too hard a name for some thing which the great political parties never scruple at doing
it was a case of diamond cut diamond
you interested the amityville people in your own town even as my father had interested them in oursonly you were shrewd enough to be more liberal
the game of politics is a selfish one at best and you just then the squire stormed in
my condolences herbert he cried in gay mood waving a slip of yellow paper above his head
his friend the enemy what asked guy startled sympathize with you but a town divided against itself is sure to fall
harmony carries the day and the deciding votes come from concord itself
five betty we have five votes more than we need
here read this telegram
the squire threw himself into a chair and guy turned mechanically towards miss betty
she had taken the message from her fathers hand and now read aloud as follows casts twentyfour votes for har mony
conservative estimate gives you five more than required twothirds majority
riot here
town in turmoil
hard to tell what will hurrah cried the excited miss pinkney wav ing her handkerchief
where in the world did those twentyfour harmony votes come from asked miss betty
her father pursed up his lips looked at the ceiling and twirled his thumbs
victory is perched on our banners betty he observed finally donot know how it got there any more than you do but whats the odds the odds
that is plainly what miss betty thought for the moment
now what do you think mr herbert she queried facing the amazed young man and shak ing the telegram before his eyes think i shall have to return the congratula the rigor of the game tions which you gave me a few moments ago laughed guy
not only that but i think too that i shall have to return to concord at once
no no said miss betty
it would be suicidal declared the squire you hear the message
riot here town in turmoil go back there until mat ters quiet down
they could have spared me in the event of a victory said guy but its cowardly to remain away in time of defeat
i must go immediately
perhaps barney will take me take you myself if youre bound to go answered the squire promptly donot want to persuade you against your convictions you know and i have the greatest respect for your courage but really afraid youll be in some danger if you go over there just at present
wait until morning anyway
no squire returned guy firmly must go tonight
and go he did heedless alike of the protesta tions of miss betty and her father
when the squire went for the horse and car riage guy bade adieu to the overjoyed miss pink ney and left the house miss betty accompanying him as far as the gate the most obstinate young man i ever saw pouted miss betty
obstinate echoed guy
well determined then
i have faith in your his friend the enemy ability to take care of yourself but please remem ber that you are not entirely recovered from that wound
i do hope you will be careful
something in her tone caused the young mans pulses to beat more rapidly
with a quick move ment he caught one of her hands from the palings of the gate am glad to know that you care so much for my welfare said he and now that the county seat question is settled you are no longer my friend the enemyare you
she laughed a little but her hand clasped his warmly and sincerely trust that we shall always be the best of friends she replied
guy longed to say more but at that moment there came a beat of hoofs a grind of wheels and then the voice all aboard herbert l coming squire guy called and added softly good night miss vlandingham
good night she murmured need not tell you how anxiously anxiously we shall await news from concord
you shall be informed of everything said he and released her hand passed out through the gate and sprang lightly into the carriage
as guy and the squire traveled quickly out of harmony bells were ringing horns were blowing guns were firing and joy was general and unconfined
when they first glimpsed the lights of concord they likewise discovered a blot of shadow hovering the rigor of the game in the road directly ahead
on drawing nearer the blot resolved itself into the outlines of a horse and carriage with a man in silhouette on the car riage seat
this rig was at a standstill and looked most ominous
why its pettibone exclaimed guy as they came in line to pass
he had recognized the high stepper and its driver by a sort of instinct
stop a moment squire
the squire drew rein
is that you herbert inquired the sheriff
how are you
nearly as good as new
glad to hear it
never had anything break me up quite so much as that skirmish and seeing you tumble into the road
where are you bound for concord
take my advice and turn back
why
it wonot be healthy for you to go there thats why
there are all kinds of stories afloat about you
in their present temper the people wouldnot like anything better than to string you up
of course i know you better and donot take any stock in their yarns
a pair of blue eyes says and i make allowances
what are the yarns queried guy hastily
he resented that allusion to blue eyes especially on the account
his friend the enemy why bilkins got back from harmony last night and told about your being at vlanding hams
people in town though didnot think much about that until those jimtown rascals voted for harmony every man jack of em
two hours ago a mob of citizens waited on keever with a rope and theyd have lynched him i guess if he hadnot sworn that you played into the enemys hands all through and that those im ported voters cast their ballots in accordance with your orders
the squire muttered an angry imprecation
those jamestown men would have given the lie to the words cried guy with some heat
possibly but they all left town in a body nearly scared out of their wits
squire vlandingham said guy appealing to his companion tell pettibone that keever is wrong donot need testimony broke in the sheriff know youre straight goods herbert
i say a pair of what are the people doing now asked guy heading the sheriff off quiet just at the present speakin the calm precedin a storm
the inhabitants are goin to cut loose in the morning and if youre around youre liable to be the storm center
why are you out here pettibone
the rigor of the game i was takin a look for the jimtown fellers but i guess have to call it a bad job
the sheriff gathered up his lines goin back now to get a little rest before the trying times that are to come tomorrow
guy arose quickly leaped out of the carriage and climbed into what are you going to do herbert cried vlandingham going on to concord said guy with de termination and i donot want you to run a needless risk by trying to take me any farther
i am much obliged to you for bringing me this far squire do anything rash my boy returned the squire earnestly
go back with me and wait until this blows over thank you for your consideration but i am face to face with a responsibility that i must not shirk
had i been in concord yesterday i could then and there have branded col state ments as false
it is a little late in the day but i shall do it now
i am grateful to you and miss betty for all that you have done for me his voice trembled a little and i shall never forget
good luck to you herbert said the squire heartily
the next moment pettibone had turned and started back towards concord
a a great silence hovered over concord
there were lights in the drug store in the emporium and in the hotel and in each establishment a knot of gloomy visaged men was gathered smoking much but saying little
the people were thinking dark thoughts and lashing themselves into a revengeful mood
the first uproar following the announcement of the concord vote was an eruption of frenzy a spontaneous outburst of anger on the part of the disappointed and angry populace
the calm that followed this storm was not a presage of peace it was rather a warning of disaster when the venge ful feelings of the people should be directed along more systematic lines
pettibone and guy when driving into town passed a huge pile of empty boxes and barrels that
guy asked
we were going to celebrate our victory with a blaze that could be seen as far as harmony the sheriff answered with a grim laugh but you know how things went and thats the reason that pile wasnot touched off
over on the left there is old cannon loaded to the muzzle with his friend the enemy scrap iron
she was to have dropped a remark that would have been heard clean acrost the county but she hasnot had the heart to let off so much as a whisper
this town is playin in tough luck herbert no two ways about that cannon was a small affair but it was the pride of the town
the druggist had bought it of a dealer in old iron in bismarck had had it shipped to concord and had placed it on guard in front of his store
along the rounded side was the conceit in red letters the boom has struck us and below on the carriage was the com mercial legend go to pinney for drugs
on the fourth of july the cannon was always in pro nounced evidence and during a certain presiden tial contest when a candidate not favored by pinney had been elected members of the successful party had gotten themselves very much disliked by stealing the cannon and firing a salute
guy had been told all this several times and he was thinking of it when pettibone drew the high stepper to an abrupt halt the matter now inquired guy
it wonot do to take you through the town was answer got to go through the town to get to the hotel
you donot go to the hotel tonight not much averred the sheriff firmly to bunk at my house herbert donot want to inconvenience you the young unmasking a traitor man demurred
mrs pettibone will not be ex pecting you worry about mrs pettibone be tickled to death to have you with us another of these blueeyed sheriffs elbow caught guy smartly in the sideand like all the rest of em she likes to stand by a feller when hes in trouble
home you go with me herbert even if i have to put you under arrest and take you by force settled
guy could not refuse an invitation of this kind and pettibone made a wide dtour which brought them to his house without traversing the main street
the young man assisted the sheriff in taking the highstepper out of the thills and pettibone and his guest went into the house together
young alec single hostage to fortune was in bed and it was evident that mrs pettibone had been keeping an anxious vigil
oh dick dick she cried throwing herself upon her husbands breast was so afraid something terrible had happened to you
did you find those men those awful men
no tilda replied the sheriff those awful men have put a wide stretch of country between themselves and concord you fret about me
he removed the clinging arms from about his neck and turned to guy
tilda this is mr herbert
herbert the lady who shares my joys
observe those bewitchin blue eyes and his friend the enemy you dick cried the agitated lady
mr herbert how do you do
dick has told me a lot about you and i think just as he does that the people of this town ought to be ashamed of them selves for the way theyve treated you
i said so a hundred times dick a brave man to come back here he dick
but youre safe as long as youre under this roof every bit as safe as youd be in the place you came from look after you dick
goodness me ainot it dreadful that weve gone and lost the countyseat have to go to harmony and live now i spose dick and alec and but i told dick to resign first and hes thinking about it
then theres col keever could any one imagine that hed do such a thing as to say that you were the one who sold us out outrageous thats what it is and i told dick so mrs pettibone rattled on appealing to her husband constantly but allowing neither him nor their guest a chance to get in a word
guy was very glad when it came time for him to go to bed
the sheriff was abroad before the young man got up and at breakfast he reported that nearly all the men in town were over by cannon havin swarmed there like a lot of crazy hor nets
some miscreant had stolen into concord and fastened a placard to the placard bearing the words charge to keep i have
this was mrs signal to hurl unmasking a traitor a torrent of indignant language at the harmony people
as this torrent could not be stemmed guy and pettibone beat a hasty retreat from the house
where now asked the sheriff heaving a sigh of relief as he and guy paused for a moment at the gate walk over to the cannon said guy must speak with the people and this seems as good a time as i could find for defending myself against charges
worst time you could pick out declared the sheriff
the people are ripe for somethin and would just as lieve hang you today and try you tomorrow going nevertheless returned guy firmly
is col keever one of the crowd not much chuckled pettibone
chris waffle and bill comfort have been watching him all night sos he couldnot clear out
the colonel is up in that little office of his wonder ing how the lightning is going to strike and when
after i talk with the citizens continued guy shall go to the blizzard office and say a few things to keever
if youre able qualified pettibone
pshaw exclaimed the young man deprecat ingly
well if youre set on it well strike out
i look for a warm time though and thats honest
his friend the enemy every male inhabitant of concord from the deserted appearance of the main street must have gone to look at that placard on cannon
store doors were all closed with the exception of those that gave entrance to the emporium
mrs glimmer sat on the steps of her husbands estab lishment knitting with fierce fervor and watching sharply for the colonel to appear at the top of the stairs leading from his office
his appearance would have caused her to ring an alarm on the bell
she saw guy vouchsafed him a startled and furious glance and rose hastily and flung into the store the way they feel remarked petti bone every man woman and child of them going to have the time of your life see said guy the steely flash in his eyes
as they passed the blizzard building the young man threw an upward look at the sanctum win dows
col keever however was not to be seen
presently they turned from the street and came within sight of the throng of men and boys crushing about the cannon and talking in loud and angry tones
so concerned were the people about this last gratuitous fling that guy and pettibone were almost upon them before they were seen
it fell to barberry to discover the approaching traitor and to make his presence known stuttered the lawyer levelling unmasking a traitor a forefinger at guy and dancing about in a wild endeavor to acquit himself of his momentous news
in his excitement the words refused to come but his manner and the pointing finger were quite sufficient
the crowd whirled an enraged shout went up and a simultaneous rush was made in direction the traitor he hung that card on the cannon l hang him to a telegraph pole tie him to the mouth of the cannon and fire it off
show him we havenot got no charge to keep show him amid the hubbub of angry cries these shouts came distinctly to ears
a slight pallor crossed his face but his determination to face the mob and defend himself against charges was intensified rather than shaken have come here to talk with you the young man cried but his words were lost in the con fusion
there has been a mistake the headlong rush of the angry citizens was not checked
leffingwell pinney barberry and pedro even at the head of the rabble and had come within a dozen feet when pettibone jerked a revolver from his hippocket and presented it full in their faces
barberry halted so suddenly that he stumbled and fell heels over head pedro smith paused ostensibly to lift the lawyer to his feet and lef his friend the enemy fingwell and pinney and those behind came to an abrupt stop
for a moment not a sound was heard
stand right where you are commanded pet tibone
if i had the riot act with me read it but just as soon shoot first and read it afterwards
do we understand pettibone demanded lef fingwell sternly that you will defend that traitor what youre to understand traitor
he is he is no he is roared the mob
give him a chance to explain canot you cried the sheriff
he could have slipped out of this town and youd never have been the wiser but he chose to come out here and talk to you
i told him it was a big risk but he insisted on coming
now that hes here hes going to say whats on his mind and youll either listen to him or therell be gunplay and fatalities
the laws behind me too donot forget that right cried chris waffle pushing out of the crowd with bill comfort at his heels the law but i be behind pettibone der to shoulder with him is where i stand
shoul her berts entitled to fair play and hes going to have it
that hits off the matter to a ty ty sec onded bill comfort pushing up his sleeves and assuming a pugilistic attitude
unmasking a traitor i the ardor of the crowd began to cool
well snapped pinney if he canot explain hell have to take his medicine
his word is worth more than bond asserted the judge
state your case herbert he added turning to guy am told that col keever accuses me of sell ing out to squire vlandingham spoke up guy
that statement is false what were you doing at house on monday night demanded leffingwell
you were there we have it on good authority
and all the while you were at sile supplemented pinney you were arranging to vote those jimtown men for harmony
while i was at sile mr pinney guy retorted was arranging to secure the amityville vote for concord
how did amity ville go
the records will prove whether i was successful or not was only a rrruse stuttered bar berry leaping into the breach guy had suddenly made in the case against him
let him tell what he was doin at vlanding hams fluttered lem bilkins from the farther edge of the crowd
col keever has worked mighty hard for this town and he couldnot lie
he wouldnot if he could bosh i say bosh
he could lie and he a hatless redhaired youth had suddenly raced around the corner of the blizzard building and his friend the enemy darted across the level stretch that separated him from the crowd
it was sampson his freckled face aglow with passion and his eyes gleaming vin dictively more the printer added taking a folded document from his pocket and shaking it above his head got proof see your proof said judge waffle snatching the document from hand
hurriedly unfolding the paper the judge glanced through it hastily knew it he cried in tri umphant tones knew it all along where did you get this sampson
old keever hasnot paid me a cent for moren a month said sampson and when i asked him for my wages we had a row
he called me every thin he could lay his tongue to and then hehe struck me with his cane
the printers voice had risen shrilly and he swayed sideways to shake his clenched fist at the blizzard building
for that blow i swore be even swore have revenge
sampson rattled the r of the last word melo dramatically
monday night dingle harp blue and boomer drove over from harmony and made for office
i saw em and i went up got into the workroom and overheard the whole thing from beginnin to end
when the harmony outfit went away keever was drunk so drunk he was dead to the world and i sneaked into the sanctum took the fiftydollar bill from his pocket and that paper from the desk
he dared to hit unmasking a traitor me he dared
sampson closed his remarks in a high and defiant treble and once more shook his fist at the building behind him
read it waffle
read the paper clamored the crowd will cried waffle
citizens of concord you shall learn what a doubledyed scoundrel we have been harboring among us
listen i let a word of this escape you of agreement made and entered into this 29th day of june by and between isaac dingle of the harmony townsite company party of the first part and archibald keever of concord party of the second part witnesseth that for and in consideration of the sum of two thousand dollars fifty dollars in hand paid receipt of which is hereby acknowl edged the other nineteen hundred and fifty dol lars to be paid immediately upon the consumma tion of the provisions of this agreement the said keever hereby covenants and agrees to cause twenty votes to be cast for harmony in the polling place at concord during the countyseat election to be held tomorrow tuesday june 30th throughout goodwill county our hands and seals this day and year above written waffle paused a moment and then added in thunderous tones his friend the enemy this document citizens of concord is signed by isaac dingle and archibald keever the sig natures being witnessed by harp blue and boomer for a moment the people were stunned and during that moment lemuel bilkins slipped away and ran for the blizzard office as swiftly as his long legs could carry him
on recovering from the shock of this revelation the mob was fairly beside itself
hoarse shouts of rage went up from a score of throats and as one man the gathering started for the blizzard build ing
guy tried to check the citizens and reason with them but pettibone caught him by the shoulder and jerked him around
herbert he said you let them alone
thank your lucky stars you got out of this as well as you did
but theyll kill keever
no they wonot put in chris waffle but the vials of wrath are uncorked and their con tents have got to be spilled
col keever was pluming himself for flight
it was his intention to wing his way westward alighting at harmony long enough to receive his nineteen hundred and fifty dollars from the com mittee of ways and means
to remain long in concord would be to court disaster
the score of men from jamestown he had sent to amityville there to await him and receive the twentyfour hundred dollars promised for their services
mr pinchbeck was to pay two thousand dollars of this sum in the event that concord won the contest
concord having lostthe men voting their wages out of their handsthere was no money for them forthcoming
im mediately upon collecting the price of his treach ery from col dingle col plan was to give amityville a wide berth
lumber and hardware bills were also due on account of the courthouse
young herbert must shoulder those and to the end that unpleasant questions might be avoided col keever had be gun his preparations for shaking the dust of concord from his feet as early as tuesday night
his friend the enemy it was his desire to depart secretly but on opening the front door of his office he found christopher waffle seated on the stairs
softly closing the door the colonel sought exit from the rear and on the back flight he came upon william comfort
the colonel smothering his wrath returned to the sanctum and waited
then he tried again only to discover that the siege had not been raised
during the entire night the editor made essays at intervals of an hour or so but was each time balked by the blockading forces
there was nothing for it but to remain where he was and brazen the matter through
morning came and found the colonel asleep in his chair
a commotion outside caused him to move restlessly
what was it he heard
excited and angry cries a sharp voice haranguing a mob an uproar as of men enraged
his faculties were blunted by his vigil of the night
he could not reason from point to point and draw proper inferences
with a stertorous sigh he changed his position in the chair and slept on
a few moments more and the outside stairs echoed with a wild clatter of ascending feet
the door was burst open and the colonel started for ward aroused and apprehensive
lemuel bilkins was before him flushed with excitement and tremulous with fear
run colonel gasped bilkins for heavens sake run l the pudgy face went white in a flash
the voice of the people the matter lemuel he demanded starting to his feet in townhe tried to talk to the peoplethey accused him of makin those jim town fellows vote for were goin for him hammer and tongs whenwhen bilkins clutching at the desk for support halted to catch his breath
when what asked the colonel in a husky whisper
speak out canot you
when sampson jumped up beside herbert and gave chris waffle a paper to read to the crowd
bilkins drew a sleeve across his dripping forehead
it was an agreement between you and the har mony people and the colonel fell over against the partition with a hollow groan
now he knew what had become of that document and where his fifty dollars had gone at that instant clamorous shouts drawing nearer and nearer were heard without swift feet ascended the stairs and suddenly there came a roar lynch him ride him out of town l sack the officepull it down about his ears l there they come burst out bilkins
hurry colonel lots of trouble lots of it he took down the hat and cane in feverish haste
go down the back stairs and run for his friend the enemy your life colonel he implored while i stay here and keep them off
hold em off lem cried the colonel taking his hat and cane
do your duty boy
thereupon the great man started for the rear exit
he proceeded with more haste however than was consistent with safety
missing the top step of the flight he tried to regain his balance by catching the next one but in vain
down he fell tumbling over and over
when he recovered himself he found that he was sitting on the damp earth his position in no wise suggestive of dignity
his head had been forced through the crown of his hat and he was endeav oring in a wild way to get a view of his sur roundings when christopher waffle bill comfort glimmer and sampson pounced upon him
stand off commanded the colonel shaking his cane to which he still adhered with a lifeand death tenacity have the law on you
egad call you out this was the great mans last defiance
caught cried comfort laying hold of him and dragging him towards the street
while the people in the street were deliberating on the fate keever should suffer at their hands there was borne to their ears a crash of glass and a form containing a chase full of type for the de layed issue of the blizzard came crashing to the ground
this was followed by documents copy ric a melancholy figure the doughty colonel the voice of the people and old papers which were caught by the wind and scattered broadcast
then there were sounds of hammering and heavy falls that shook the building to its very foundations while type cases and type rollers brushes cans of ink and lye and every conceivable thing known to a pioneer news paper office came raining down from every door and window
pinney came out on the steps of the emporium with a rope which he waved frantically above his head
hang him he shouted hang the scoun drel guy appeared at the druggists side as if by magic and snatched the rope from his hands
no cried guy sternly
nothing of that kind rail a rail yelled sampson ceasing a mad dance around his former employer for the pur pose of offering the suggestion
ride the gentle man out of town l in lieu of a rail a length of fourbyfour was secured keever was placed astride it and then carried amid hoots and jeers along the entire length of the main street
and a melancholy figure the doughty colonel presented
that white hat so often and proudly declared to be the badge of his political rank and social position was still about his ears while the crown hinged by a thread at the back opened and closed 24o his friend the enemy with every movement of the four stout men who carried the timber on their shoulders
the clothes were torn one end of his collar was flapping dismally about his neck and he had lost a shoe but never once did he forget himself and release his hold on his cane
some two miles out of town the angry citizens dropped their victim roughly and gave him warn ing in terms more forcible than polite never more to show his face within the corporate limits of concord
sampson was the last of the indignant people to make his way back to town
as he was about to pass from sight he turned for one final glimpse of his former employer
and there the colonel sat he the great man who had raised out of nothing that monument of tireless energy and intellectual grandeur the concord blizzard
the monument was gonehad passed away in a breathand there he sat soli tary and alone pondering the depth of his fall
and he touched by the woful spectacle
rearing himself to his full height he gave a shout of triumph and waved hit me with your cane
hit me with your cane will then he shook his clenched his hat he shouted shrilly you fist whirled about and continued on towards concord
he had carried his vengeance to a point which would have satisfied an ordinary mortal but there the voice of the people i was nothing ordinary about sampson
his ire had mounted high not only against the colonel but against everything that had formed a part and parcel of the equipment
the newspaper had gasped its last under the stran gling fingers of the mob so that nothing remained save the building that had housed the plant and even that was hateful to the printer
while plodding homeward his thoughts were more than busy and he evolved an idea that caused him to slap his skinny hands together and laugh impishly be the last act he muttered and the townll have somethin thatll help to keep my memory green do ityes sir do it if it takes a leg in pursuance of his plan sampson reentered the town by stealth
screened by the watertank he cautiously reconnoitered the situation and dis covered that the weary and perspiring citizens were gathering about the doors of the hotel
nothing could have been more favorable and sampson gave vent to an unholy chuckle
mebby they wonot be surprised he whispered to himself oh mebby they wonot
warily he crossed the railroad track crawled on hands and knees the full length of several piles of railroad ties and then by skilful manoeuvering gained the rear of the hotel unseen
from this point the course was clear and he did not halt until he reached the cannon
his friend the enemy excepting sampson there was not a soul any where in the vicinity of the twelvepounder
mrs glimmer now that the colonel had been removed from the town had retired into the emporium with her knitting and her husband was still lin gering among those who hovered about the hotel
herkimer was on duty in the livery barn but the troubles of the town were nothing to him and he was cleaning harness in the harness room nefarious work might have been wit nessed by any one who chanced to stand in front of the emporium or the livery barn and hence it will be seen how fortune continued to favor him salute the blizzard muttered sampson with a laugh of the demoniacal kind give the blizzard a boom then he tugged and pushed with tremendous energy until he had brought the muzzle of the cannon in line with the blizzard building
when this was accomplished he fished a match out of his pocket and struck it against the side of the gun
from the fact that this particular piece of ar tillery had been purchased of a junk dealer it had never had the full and unqualified confidence of those who were designated to fire it off
as a precaution therefore it was usually discharged by means of a two minutes grace being utilized by the man who lighted the fuse in placing himself at a safe distance
this precautionary measure was well known to samp the voice of the people son and after he had applied the match he took to his heels
he did not get too far away how ever for he wanted to witness the devastation
while he stood watching and waiting he sud denly remembered that some dynamite left over from the operations of the imported roadbuilders was stored in the first story of the structure on which he had trained the cannon and besides the dynamite there was also an assortment of fire works bought with a fund raised by popular subscription to be used in celebrating the coming fourth of july
great scott murmured sampson huskily
by a wild impulse he started towards the can non then he turned abruptly gave a despairing groan and made in the opposite direction pallid fearful and bent only on getting away from the scene of his rash deed before the direful conse quences could overtake him
a pettibone had remained discreetly in the back ground during the spilling of those vials of wrath
guy had also kept clear of the mob but his reason for doing so was different from petti bones
if an investigation had followed that mornings work it might reasonably have been asked why if the sheriff was present he had not performed his sworn duty and prevented a destruction of prop erty and the subsequent violence which had been visited upon a citizen of the town culpable though he undoubtedly was
pettibone forestalled the question by taking himself out of the way
as for guy he had suffered by the misdoing far more than any one else in concord and might have been excused the desire to see punishment fall where it was so justly deserved
but the desire was lacking
he did not care to glory in the downfall much less to wit ness it
so after the citizens had disappeared with the hated offender he seated himself on the hotel veranda and was presently joined by the sheriff
his friend the enemy the activities of our friend the colonel will now be transferred to other quarters observed pettibone bringing a chair from the office and dropping into it with a deep breath of satisfac tion
heaven help the other quarters he added soulfully
herbert if it hadnot been for that redheaded printer i hate to think what might have happened to you
truth crushed to earth will rise again smiled the young man
and the way of the transgressor is mighty hardas the colonel has probably discovered by this time
pettibone took an old pipe from one pocket a handful of tobacco from another and was soon shrouded in a cloud of smoke
lone some will used to be loaded to the waterline with all these here proverbs old sayins wise saws and so on
had one for most every occasion
ever hear about lonesome will herbert
he was a harmony man and hes dead now live in harmony but was on that side of the county you understand
miss blueeyes knows all about looked at guy with a some time when the signs are just right you get her to tell you about lonesome will
what do you mean by the signs being just right might doyou two alone then the story then a talk a fortunate disaster pshaw interrupted guy reddening
all right laughed pettibone change the subject
heard just how the voting came out know that concord lost and thats enough for me votes were cast in the concord pollingplace the sheriff went on and only twentyfive of the fortynine were favorable to this town
twenty of the remaining twentyfour were as a matter of course cast by those hood lums from jimtown but who were the other four that voted here and voted for harmony
guy shook his head
he had it in mind to name sampson as one of the four but refrained
some of the farmers who come in here to ex ercise the right of franchise must have been bought up by the other side proceeded pettibone
amityville going solid for us was the biggest kind of a surprise and when you explained how it happened over there by cannon you made your first tally not particularly proud of that said the young man suppose though that the only way to fight the devil is with fire all in your point of view chuckled the sheriff
politics is a muddy country and you canot go through it and keep your shoes clean
but to come back to the election it was the great big vote rolled up by harmony that settled the case people presented him his friend the enemy with eightyone ballots think of that
several votes could be thrown out and harmony would still have more than a twothirds majority done up brown herbert thats sure accept the defeat as gracefully as we can returned guy
what will you do petti bone
move over to harmony
no harmony for me
after a little going to resign
you see got a nice eighty joining the corner of this townsite and i was thinking if concord won that block it off into lots and call it addition
now that woke up and found that was a dream i guess farm it
he was silent for a minute puffing re flectively at his pipe one thing thats worrying me herbert he added finally
what is that not much on religion although got a streak of veneration in me all the same and telling you that when people sow the wind theyre going to reap the whirlwind gospel ainot it believe so but how does it apply to this countyseat affair
well now theres the colonel
pettibone re moved his pipe from his mouth and waved it in the direction of the returning mob whose van guard was coming into sight along the railroad track to the west
we know what he sowed and we know what he reapedpurty near
we
a fortunate disaster yes
to go still further then do you think that running in a lot of rowdies from jimtown and bismarck as concord and harmony have done is anything more or less than sowing trouble
i donot and if we donot reap a cyclone miss my guess make a mistake herbert and think a calamity howler cause i ainot god knows
but in dead earnest with you now and i say we havenot reached the end had our dance and weve got to pay the fiddler
those jimtown hoodlums got out of town purty fast tuesday night but positive they had an understanding with keever and just as positive that what ever keever has agreed to do by em he wonot do
work a real injury to a mana man that hasnot any scruples to speak ofand you make out of him an engyne of destruction
ketch my mean ing the next thing to saying that possibly the position of sheriff in this county of goodwill wonot be quite so much of a sinecure during the next few days as it has been up to now why delayin my resignation mind was debating momen tous words when pinney leffingwell and pedro smith came wearily up to the veranda and threw themselves down on the steps
the rest of the party straggled along after them by twos and threes dropping on the ground the moment they reached the shady side of the hotel building
they were all dusty tired and perspiring but a calm 25o his friend the enemy sense of duty well done brought a glow of satis faction to every face
nothing was said for some time then mr glim mer seated on the edge of the veranda fanning himself with his hat lifted his voice sic semper tyrannis said he glaring about him through his spectacles
in those quarters where it was understood the remark was duly approved
gentlemen remarked pinney rising to his feet the people have spoken in no uncertain tone
the torrent popular wrath anderrighteous indignation has overflowed its banks and engulfed the common enemy
he ceased
there was general surprise for no one had imagined that the druggist could plume his speech with such rhetoric
emboldened by a ripple of applause the speaker continued like lightning from a clear sky the depth of this man perfidy was suddenly made known to us
we did not pause we did not hesi tate
we leaped forward as one man and then artillery boomed out zigzag flashes bespangled the firmament the earth trem bled opened and keever from the sight of man
the voice of the people had been heard the hand of the people had been felt l this magnificent period was received by the gathering in silent awe thunder had defied nature by preceding the lightning but that a fortunate disaster i was a minor point
as he stood before them erect and glowing with his impromptu effort it seemed to the citizens as though the mantle of the editor had fallen upon the shoulders of the drug gist
as if to emphasize and illustrate the figurative terms of the orator a hoarse from the lower end of the main street tagged closely upon the heels of his peroration
it was the cannon pinney and the others recognized the sound but had barely time to exchange apprehensive glances when a terrific detonation shook the earth set every building in town aquiver crashed into fragments all the glass in all the windows and hurled glimmer from the veranda and levelled pinney in his tracks
a lurid glare ghastly in the white light of day hovered sullenly over concord
swiftly it faded dbris began to rain down and rockets and roman candles opened a furious bombardment with their flaming balls
strange serpentine things left fiery trails in the streets and open spaces or wriggled in glowing lines over the rooftops or streaked luminously through the air exploding as they vanished pinwheels sputtered above and below and flashed into nothing with a shower of sparks firecrackers popped merrily here there and everywhere a bass note being frequently sounded by one of the cannon variety and in front of the hotel a wonderful contrivance came plumping down and forthwith unbosomed itself of his friend the enemy a veritable whirlwind of blazing vagaries closing with a beacon that changed from red to white and then to blue
then there ensued a lull in the wild confusion of fire and noise and glimmer raising himself from the ground pointed across the street towards the roof of the townsite com panys building
look he cried huskily
the eyes of the bewildered people followed the pointing finger and beheld a setpiece whose in tricate wires had become entangled with the cop ing of the roof
thus held the device was sputter ing and hissing and tracing in bloodred letters the ironical word what had happened
eyes sought eyes and put the silent question
the citizens began to move mechanically as though awakening from some horrible nightmare
women and small children could be seen rushing from their dwellings and could be heard screaming and lamenting
a runa way team with a lumber wagon bounding behind plunged across the railroad track and disappeared beyond the depot
stray cows galloped from point to point with frenzied bellows and dogs crouched shivering and whining in any chance corner that might afford protection
the blizzard building cried pettibone dash ing one hand across his eyes
there was dyna mite there and the fireworks for the fourth blown up he sprang from the veranda and started south at a run the people following
a fortunate disaster never mind the blizzard building shouted guy keenly alive to the dangers of the moment
fires may result from all this go to your homes and stores quiet your families and guard against fires this warning struck home and the frightened crowd disintegrated in every direction
guy as soon as he made sure his advice would be acted upon hurried down the street in the direction taken by pettibone
as he ran he noticed the broken windows on either side and observed that the litter of splintered boards increased as he ad vanced
at last he reached the spot where the blizzard building had stood only to find that it had disappeared a deep hole in the earth marking its site
more dbris was banked up about the brink of the hole and on the highest part of the heap stood the sheriff this the worst you ever heard herbert
pettibone called to guy argued against hav ing that dynamite stored here but keever had his say as usual under me not you he says and that settled it
looket that cannon he added waving his hand towards the gun around whose muzzle a broken windowframe was hang ing some un pointed it this way and touched it off
who was it what like to know
if there had been as much of that dyna mite in the storeroom as there was a month ago telling you concord would have been wiped off the map
his friend the enemy guy climbed up beside pettibone and surveyed the ruin from that position
the building flimsily constructed at best had been literally riven asun der the walls blown to fragments and crushed back and the roof scattered piecemeal over the whole townsite
for fully ten feet downward the earth had been displaced heaved up at the sides and hurled over the broken boards and timbers
the sheriff talking under his breath and shaking his head gloomily moved off towards the cannon and guy lowered himself carefully down the ragged sides of the pit
he saw something that startled him
it was an object irregular in shape and little larger than a mans fist
picking up the fragment with trembling hands he pinched it in his fingers examined it on every side and then dropped it into his pocket
he was pale with excitement and looked up wards in the hope of seeing some one to whom he could announce his find
but the sheriff had not returned and there was no one else to hear his news
suddenly a doubt swept through his brain
that fragment might have been in the storeroom at the time of the explosion pressed one hand to his forehead and stood for a second immovable the next moment he had hurried stumblingly to the deepest part of the pit had sunk to his knees and had begun scraping away the earth with his hands
no no he whispered where it came from right here he got up and stamped with a fortunate disaster his heel in half a dozen different places
there is no doubt he said to himself no doubt in the world
climbing out of the pit he dropped down on the heap of ruins and bowed his face in his hands
what ails you herbert
it was pettibone
he had approached unno ticed and was standing at the young mans elbow
what ails me
guy repeated laughing jerkily
oh nothing nothing
is it you pettibone
he reached out and caught the sheriffs arm raising himself slowly
his face was still pale but his eyes were bright and growing brighter
what makes you think that there is anything the mat ter with me he asked
great scott exclaimed the sheriff only have to look at you to see that theres something up
you own eighty acres adjoining this townsite do you pettibone
yes returned the other wonderingly
then keep it donot sell it no matter what youre offered
tell every one else who owns land around this town to hold on to what theyve got possible pettibone guy brought his lips close to ear that your eighty will make you rich
pettibone recoiled a step and looked at the young man sharply
are you crazy or what he demanded
guy laughed again this time more naturally
his friend the enemy not a prophet exactly said he but un less very much mistaken the blowing up of this building will prove the making cf concord
let harmony have the countyseat if am not deceived concord has got something a hundred times more valuable look at me that way pettibone not raving and my mind is just as clear as yours is this minute
the man whoever he was who poured a broadside from cannon into the blizzard building is entitled to a vote of thanks by every one in this community
guy turned and walked away and pettibone looked after him thunderstruck
merciful powers muttered the sheriff
can it be that the loss of the countyseat and a slump in the value of twelve hundred lots more or less has turned brain
i never saw him like that before it ainot naturalno sir not with him
two hours later an eastbound freight train backed along the concord siding picked up a box car and steamed away with it in the direction of jamestown
this box car would technically have been called an empty
but it was not empty in the strict meaning of the word for sampson was inside far gone with terror because of the havoc he had wrought and scarcely daring to breathe until concord had been left safely behind him
no fires no fatalities no one even seriously injured this was the remarkable record of the morning of that redletter day when col keever was banished the town and when sampson fired into the blizzard building and blew it to the four winds
there was a property loss to be sure for apart from the destruction of the printing estab lishment and the roof that had sheltered itthe colonel owning a small equity in eachnot a whole pane of glass had been left in any building in concord
whether the town was worth the expense and trouble of reglazing its windows was a query propounded by mr biggs the register of deeds
this matter was discussed in a spirit of levity and sarcasm not seriously
and when it was found that mr biggs had spoken in sober earnest and was to leave for harmony on the sixthirty freight the levity and sarcasm gave place to scorn and derision
mr biggs carrying a carpetbag and bandbox filled with his worldly goods was accompanied to the train by a procession of citizens
pedro his friend the enemy smith had a fife and bill comfort a drum and there were hastily devised brownpaper signs borne aloft some of them reading our gain is har monys loss drummed out of town the only one to go and what was he good for anyhow
it is needless to say that this honor was en tirely unsolicited by mr biggs or that he failed to shake hands with the delegation before climbing the steps of the waycar and dodging inside to escape the missiles that were hurled at him
later that evening guy had a very serious dis cussion with pettibone in one corner of the hotel office
in the course of an hour the young man succeeded not only in convincing the sheriff of his sanity but of several other important matters which vitally concerned the future of concord
herbert said pettibone shaking hands with guy when ready to go a brick one chance in ten that youre wrong or that the business wonot pan out but the other nine chances are good enough for me
keep it quiet for a while
the men who own the land around here ought to know about it for their own protection
trust me tell every one thats interested
pettibone strode off with a beaming face and an unwonted look in his eyes
he was alive to the possibilities of great discovery and his awakening had brought with it no small amount of excitement
the young man slept but little that night for developing the great discovery his brain continued to busy itself with stray thoughts and halfformed plans
he was astir early and after an early breakfast walked over to the pettibone eighty and found its owner hard at work with a shovel told everybody that ought to know said pettibone leaning on the shovel and looking up at guy from the hole he was digging and i can tell you of five others who got to tearing at the ground before sunup
strange the discovery was never made before remarked guy
how could it have been made except by an explosion like we had yesterday
why in digging cellars or wells all the wells around here are driven inter rupted pettibone not a one of em dug
and as for cellars i suppose there are a few cyclone cellars and the like but theyre not down over six feet if theyre that
by noon herbert be able to tell you whether your theory is straight goods or only moonshine
let me know when you find out
count on that
guy returned to the hotel and composed himself to await reports of the development work
while he was sitting on the veranda the train from the west drew up at the depot platform and he was very much surprised to see no less a per sonage than mr pinchbeck alight and turn his steps in the direction of the hotel
26o his friend the enemy by jovel exclaimed guy as a particularly bright thought came to him just the fel low my condolences mr herbert said the capital ist tendering guy his right hand and grabbing his glasses with his left
thank you returned guy smiling a little as he shook the outstretched hand
have you come to find out how concord is taking her de feat mr pinchbeck
not that exactly
i was curious to see the effects of that explosion you had here yesterday
we heard it in harmony and couldnot imagine what was up
others from there would have come with me but they didnot think it was hardly safe
by the way and here pinchbeck put his refrac tory glasses in his pocket and vouchsafed the young man a nearsighted squint you are alive after all arenot you
very much laughed guy
we had it in harmony that you had been blown from the mouth of a cannon hung from a telegraph pole tarred and feathered and ridden out of town and i donot know what all
preposterous exclaimed guy his thoughts at once reverting to miss betty
after the treatment accorded col keever said mr pinchbeck we could believe almost any thing of concord
not that keever didnot deserve all he got he added hastily the lawlessness we deplore
developing the great discovery do you know what became of col keever mr pinchbeck
guy himself deplored the lawlessness and was anxious to turn to another side of the subject
the capitalist laughed softly
the colonel limped into harmony about noon yesterday said he a melancholy spectacle if there ever was one
he could barely drag himself to the edge of the depot platform and there he sat his hands on the head of his cane and his chin on his hands
really he looked as though a hadnot a friend in the world
dingle harp blue and boomer heard he was in town and they walked to the depot and paid him something like nineteen hundred dollars the price of his treachery interjected guy
so i was told
dingle invited him to go to the hotel and keever would have accepted the invita tion i guess if miss vlandingham hadnot driven up just then
she had been fully informed of the transaction between keever and the committee of ways and means and my my l mr pinchbeck shrugged his shoulders compressed his lips and looked wildly at guy
if youre ever told that that girl hasnot a temper donot believe it
the lecture she read to keever was so hot it made him fairly shrivel
and she didnot confine herself to the colonel either but turned her fire on dingle harp blue and boomer and kept it going until she had given them a thorough understand ing of what she thought of their doings
when his friend the enemy she was through she ordered keever out of town on the first train east or west and drove off
gracious that was a talk to remember her bert
it is difficult to understand miss vlanding ham at times said guy wondering why she should applaud him for securing the amityville vote and then turn squarely about and condemn dingle and his associates for securing the james town contingent through the colonel
difficult echoed mr pinchbeck impossible sir impossible but she always has the courage of her convictions
always added guy and spoke in such a tone that the other shot a swift glance at him
guy met the glance calmly and asked do you want that block of concord lots mr pinchbeck
hardly was the reply with an expansive smile
suppose i could convince you that it would be a good investment
it would be impossible for you to do that would like to try at any rate
will you come upstairs with me to my room
i have something there i wish to show you
certainly if you wish it but i tell you plainly that i have already closed with vlandingham
harmony is the coming town of goodwill county
the young man made no response but led the way into the hotel and up to his room
for more developing the great discovery than an hour he was closeted with the capitalist and the latter was a highly excited man when they reappeared
accompanied by guy mr pinch beck paid a visit to the hole in the earth where the blizzard building had stood descended into it and went down on his knees at the deepest part
he was even more excited when he climbed out of the pit
a horse and carriage were secured and guy drove the capitalist to eighty
the perspiring sheriff had just found what he was looking for and was wildly hilarious
the commercial instinct was snapping in pinch becks eyes as he examined the broken fragment which pettibone had to show for his mornings work
there are others digging you say asked pinchbeck in a businesslike tone
pettibone replied affirmatively and indicated the various points where development work was in progress go to these places herbert said pinch beck
the round was made and when the young man and the capitalist returned to concord they were of one mind regarding the bright future that lay before the town
you should have kept this to yourself herbert commented pinchbeck and secured options on all the land around here
that isnot the way i was brought up re turned guy
his friend the enemy ah murmured the capitalist with a slight curl of the upper lip
you expect to make your money out of the lots
yes
may i still have an option on that block at the original figure
until saturday mr pinchbeck
very well going to jamestown by first train and will take some of the stuff with me
meanwhile it would be well for you to go to amityville and have a good talk with abe landy
landy is probably anxious to have a good talk with me about now said guy with a short laugh shall ride over there this afternoon
let me impress upon you the necessity of keep ing this as quiet as possible for the present said pinchbeck with great earnestness
you thought it best to notify those directly interested and i shall not quarrel with you on that point but there is no earthly use in publishing the news yet awhile have not published the news said guy and do not intend to do so
those already noti fied have their instructions to say nothing until the proper time arrives
immediately after dinner guy secured a saddle horse stuffed samples of the material that prom ised such wonders for concord into a pair of saddlebags and started for amityville by the south roadthe one that led past lake elizabeth
much as he desired to visit harmony he had yet developing the great discovery decided not to do so on the way to amityville but on his return
he could then inform miss incidentally the recent events in concord
man proposes however and fate wills otherwise
half a mile beyond the lake he met miss betty out for a canter on one of her fathers spirited horses
a vision of rare loveliness guy thought her gowned in her riding habit and skilfully curbing the highbred animal she rode
why was it he asked himself that every time he saw her she ap peared more and more beautiful in his eyes
well mr herbert l she cried her eyes danc ing
is this what you call keeping your promise to let us know of your safety and wellbeing
thursday sir and it was tuesday night when you left harmony to plunge into the thick of your enemies
we have heard dreadful things about you
she turned her horse and continued on at his side
you said you had faith in my ability to look out for number one he smiled
the sight of you alive and apparently well she gave him an artful side that my confidence was not misplaced
we will ride straight to willowview and there you shall render a full and accurate account of everything that has happened to you since that fateful tues day night
come race you to harmony l nothing would please me more miss vlanding ham if i were going to harmony
his friend the enemy then you were not coming to see us after all
she turned her face full upon him
oh yes he replied on my way back from amityville
very well she said
my father and i are both very eager to hear of the exciting events that have taken place in that town of yours
concord it seems has not had a monopoly of the exciting events guy observed
no she returned interrogatively
where else in the county has anything recently occurred that is worth mentioning
mr pinchbeck was telling me this morning how col keever paid harmony a flying visit and collected the money due him from the committee of ways and means
deep color flashed into miss face
mr pinchbeck is very observing said she presume he also told you how miss vlanding ham stormed at the colonel and hurled her scath ing denunciations at the committee
she did not wait for guy to answer but continued hastily with a touch of bitterness in her voice oh if i had only known of that call the committee made on col keever monday night what would you have done asked guy quietly
done she repeated with sparkling eyes would not have countenanced the proceeding that infamous bargain would not have been made
if that bargain had not been made harmony would not have secured the countyseat
developing the great discovery l she echoed in fine scorn
is that all we have to think about or live for
the whole town of harmony is as nothing weighed in the balance with that despicable piece of work l guy quite lost his breath
why he murmured when i made it an ob ject for those amityville men to vote for har mony you found no fault with me for doing it
therefore you think me inconsistent she exclaimed
but that was far from being a parallel case
you took my fathers weapons out of his hands and won the amityville people by his own methods
i was proud of you for that
suppose however you had come to harmony like a thief in the night suppose you had plied col dingle with liquor until he was intoxicated and suppose you had there and then hired him to make those men from working for my father mind and drawing their pay from him suppose you had hired col dingle to make those men vote for concord
if you had done that guy herbert you would have been beneath contempt her eyes gleamed her bosom heaved under its stress of passion and her words came clear and keen
guy gazed at her mutely
as she stated the case it looked altogether different to him
but you would not have done such a thing she went on you could not have done it
nor would you wrong me by thinking i had the slight his friend the enemy est knowledge of what was going forward or by my silence gave even a tacit consent to it
you did not think that did you
tell me please tell me you did not
there was a pleading tone in her voice and a suggestion of tears in her eyes was sure you knew nothing about that said guy
why were you sure of it she asked looking at him steadily
had i not told you that it was all a case of diamond cut diamond
did you not see me actively engaged in the stealing of your courthouse
those were not parallel cases he answered in her own words
but for you miss vlandingham this contest would have been a sanguinary one
i had no influence you threw the weight of yours into the scales and by a diplomacy as rare as it was skilful warded off the violence that seemed bound to come
the loss of one life would not have paid for a dozen countyseats
there was a strange something in the blue eyes as they bent upon him and why could he not read their mystery
if i could undo the wrong said she after a brief pause if the election might be recalled and held over again believe me concord would hold its own
why did you not tell me mr herbert that success or failure meant so much to you
mr whittaker told us alleverything that you were so careful to hide from us
were you afraid developing the great discovery of our generosity afraid we should think less of you oror her voice choked tears started from her eyes and she abruptly turned from him and darted away along the road that led to harmony
betty he called after her betty l her answer was a quick use of the whip and never a backward glance did she deign him
he struck into a gallop with the intention of over taking her but by that time her horse was at a run and pursuit on a livery hack was simply a useless effort
as he drew to a slower pace she looked around and flourished her whip
we shall expect you this evening she cried and continued on her way at a more leisurely pace
twenty minutes later she was at willowview and had found barney a yellow envelope in his hand waiting impatiently at the gate
what is it barney she asked drawing to a halt telegram for the squire miss betty he re plied holding out the message and its marked rush
i canot find the squire anywhere and didnot know what the nation to do about it
when did it come she asked taking the en velope and tearing it open a quarter of an hour ago she read the message and her face paled and an exclamation escaped her
anythin serious asked barney startled
it is from the telegraph operator at amity 27o his friend the enemy ville betty answered in a hurried tone
listen barney
she read aloud as follows jamestown hoodlums are terrorizing the town
send invincibles without delay
have wired the sheriff muttered barney thought thered be trouble with that gang
hold my horse a moment
betty was out of the saddle and on the ground in a twinkling
hurrying into the house she presently reappeared with her fathers dropping these on saddle unassisted she said sharply shotgun and cartridge belt the ground she regained the hand them to me barney take that message to col dingle at once if you canot find him give it to maj
harp or capt blue
but donot be long in finding somebody
barney his eyes wide with astonishment and wonder had handed her the gun and the belt
running her arm through the belt and holding the gun across the horse in front of her she turned with her last word and dashed away at a gallop
judas priest exclaimed barney goin over there alone an shell be killed what does she mean anyhow
betty however had no intention of facing those jamestown hoodlums
it was her purpose to overtake guy if she could and warn him
if she could not overtake him before he reached amity ville she might at least be able to give him something with which to defend himself
the twenty jamestown men spent tuesday night at a deserted shack in the hills two miles west of harmony and on wednesday morning hungry and sullen marched down on the half score of wretched houses comprising the town of amityville
there were but fifteen men of legal age living in the settlement and thirteen of these had left on a twoday bone hunting expedition in the rough country to the north
the struggle for existence was a hard one in amityville and abe landy and his neighbors were compelled to make shift in every way to provide food for their wives and children
when the days work failed scouring the country for bleached buffalo bones was re sorted to
the lordly bison once roamed the country in countless numbers and their ruthless slaughter by red men and white was mutely re vealed by the litter of bones to be found every where
these relics were gathered into large heaps near the town and shipped east in carload lots to be used in some part of the process of refining sugar
they brought eight dollars the ton
his friend the enemy of the two men left behind by the bonehunters one kept the single small store which the town boasted and the other was the station agent and telegraph operator
at first the jamestown men were not disposed to cause trouble
their imaginations were at work but as yet had furnished them with no well defined grievance
they were expecting col keever to come to amityville and carry out his promises
knowing him as they did however they were filled with doubts and misgivings
two dollars a day was an unheardof price for the amount of work these men had been called upon to do but perhaps it was cheap enough when the main object is considered
nevertheless the bargain had been made and the labor such as it was completed
the men were expecting the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars each and if it was not forthcoming their evil passions would assuredly obtain the upper hand
among them they had a little money and this they used to buy crackers and cheese and a few drinks from a barrel which the storekeeper ex ploited on thirsty occasions
after that they lounged in the shade scowling at the women and children who stole forth to take frightened looks at them
from house to house a still alarm had spread and there was much disquiet in amityville as the morning wore away without witnessing the departure of the unwelcome guests
reaping the whirlwind at noon more money was produced and there was a further purchase of food and a continued and more liberal patronage of the storekeepers barrel
the colonel had not presented himself and the jamestown men delegated two of their number to visit harmony and obtain news of his whereabouts
it was a long walk and the messengers did not return until dusk
the tale they brought with them stirred the tempers of their comrades to an inordinate degree
col keever had been in har mony had collected over nineteen hundred dollars and had soon afterwards taken an eastbound train
there was no longer any room for doubt he had cheated them out of their wages the hoarse shouts and lurid oaths that went up from the jamestown men could be heard all over the small settlement
the doors of every house were locked and behind them crouched women with pallid faces and wildly beating hearts gather ing their little ones about them with trembling arms
one question the jamestown men were debat ing in view of the failure of keever to pay them their just dues to whom should they now look
to young herbert or to vlandingham
it was a fine point and opinion was equally divided
keever had hired them but he had ostensibly acted for herbert
on the other hand vlanding ham had secured the benefit of their ballots
herbert was legally but vlandingham was mor ally constrained to pay
his friend the enemy the discussion waxed warm and more liquor was needed to oil the grooves of contention
the storekeeper was routed out of his bed and made to draw glass after glass from the barrel
no money changed hands and thus the first unlawful step was taken
the night passed with the riot ous crew in possession of the store besotted with drink and sleeping on counters in corners and wherever sufficient space could be found to lay themselves
morning dawned and the sun rose high before these unwelcome strangers began to rouse them selves
they were morose sulky revengeful but their carousal of the night had numbed their brains and brought with it an aversion for physi cal effort
crawling from the store to the outside shade they lay with limbs outsprawled and with minds dormant but ready as tinder to catch the flame of lawlessness and riot
it needed but the right man to awaken them and this man in due course lifted himself erect and gave the brief harangue that effected his purpose
in a body they rushed into the store and de manded more liquor
the storekeeper refused the demand and was struck over the head and hurled helpless into one corner the men taking what they wanted
firearms and ammunition formed part of the stock in trade and the weapons were laid hold of and loaded and fired in a spirit of pure abandon and devilmaycare
the sound of the first shot drove women and reaping the whirlwind children from their homes in a panic
huddling together as if for protection and screaming and wailing at every step they ran to one of the bone piles and cowered behind it
that first shot also alarmed the man in the depot building
he came to the door with a white scared face and looked in the direction of the ragged file of shanties
the din of the disorder struck on his ears in in creasing volume he saw the fleeing women and children and turned rushed to the telegraph key and sent his urgent call to the sheriff and to squire vlandingham
it was something more than half an hour after this that guy herbert came spurring towards amityville
the shuttle of his fancy was weaving an intricate design in cloth of gold his senses were all turned inward and he had eyes and ears for nothing that took place ahead of him
only when a supplicating cry went up at his side a white object leaped into the road and his horse shied and nearly unseated him did he come to himself
taking a stronger grip on the reins he regained control of his horse and looked in amaze ment at the whitefaced frantic unkempt women and children by whom he was surrounded
oh sir in name help us help us came the distracted cry while eager hands were thrust out and caught convulsively at the bits the stirrups his hands and even his clothing
and there was one wail soulracking in its intense anguish that shrilled high above all the other his friend the enemy cries oh my little luther mammys boy be killed i jest know hell be killed the babble of tearful voices was lost at that moment in a ribald roar that broke from the town
guy swerved a startled glance in that direction and saw a man reel out of the store a revolver in each hand
for a moment he stag gered then both weapons bellowed recklessly to right and left and he fell down the store steps and lay in a shapeless heap on the ground
what is the meaning of all this asked guy
what has happened
a dozen distraught voices sought to answer his question
one at a time please he said laying a gentle hand on the arm of the woman who seemed to have the great est burden of grief
you tell me what is the matter
the jimtown men she cried brokenly
our men folks are off be back till pete lacy who keeps the store and jim hicks the station man was leftand oh i do think theyve killed pete luther little luther mammys boy
she covered her face with her apron and broke into a fit of hysterical weeping two towheaded children hanging to her skirts and crying a lusty accompaniment her youngun sir put in a gaunt sandy haired woman who had a babe at the breast
her sister lives with her and when they run from the house she thought her sister had luther reaping the whirlwind but she hadnot so the boys back there and no tellin whatll come of him
oh these fiends these ruffians fearin theyll set fire to the town an burn what they donot destroy in other ways from concord said another woman turning fiercely to shake her fist towards the east the riffraff an offscourins that was brought in to vote for the countyseat
they bring em in an were the ones to suffer the justice o that
the white leaped into the young mans face
aye his heart echoed where was the justice of it when these poor souls were made to bear the effects of evil deeds
and in this dire reckoning he himself was a factor and must shoul der his share of the responsibility
he turned to the woman who had her face in her apron touch ing her head slightly to signify that his words were addressed to her
which is your house he asked
the first one this side of the store buildin she answered looking up at him with her faded blue eyes swimming in tears
abe wife she added
oh if abe was only here if he was only here go back behind that bone pile and wait said guy in a tone of calm authority see what i can do
leaning forward he softly loosed the hands that clung to the bridle please
let me ride on his friend the enemy they separated to right and left
he passed them town fallen store made sharp use of the whip and rode into at a gallop
only the one man who had from the steps was visible but from the came sounds of turmoil and depredation the small structure rocking under the pentup violence house was perhaps a dozen yards from the store
halting in front guy threw himself to the ground dropped the bridle reins over a post and rushed into the dwelling
it was divided into two parts living room and kitchen and the dis order everywhere apparent spoke mutely of the hurried flight of the inmates
the boy who was occasioning his mother so much worry was not to be seen
after a hasty look through the kitchen guy returned to the other room and called the youngsters name
a muffled sob from under the bed furnished a clue and guy dropped flat on the floor and had soon drawn young luther into sight by one of his bare little legs
the child was more frightened than hurt and when picked up squirmed furiously and cried for his mother at the top of his voice
guy had no time to use pacifying measures
he must first restore luther to his mothers arms and then do his utmost to stop the nefarious work of the jamestown men
bounding through the door he made for his horse
to his dismay he discovered that two of the tipsy rioters had taken possession of the animal one holding its reaping the whirlwind head while the other endeavored clumsily to mount
the cries of young luther drew the attention of the two men and likewise brought a floundering quartet to the front of the store
by thunder boys roared one of the four bracing himself in the doorway young herbert hear
young herbert the time to get our money herbert herbert followed an explosive chorus of thick voices
make him pay us
shoot him if he donot pay us
a rush of jostling stumbling and swearing men accompanied the words
guy thoroughly under stood the peril of his position and decided quickly as to what he should do
his actions were greatly hampered by young luther but to abandon the boy was an expedient he would not even consider
had guy been fully recovered from his wound and in possession of his normal strength he would have thought but lightly of his contemplated move
as it was he had fears of the outcome
still he could only do his best and trust the rest to fortune
switching young luther to his left arm guy raced for the horse
the bit was still held by the man at the animals head the other confronting guy with his back to the saddle stirrup
out of my way commanded the young man his eyes flashing dangerously
the mans reply was an oath
a revolver 28o his friend the enemy gleamed in his hand and was raised unsteadily
with a quick movement guy caught the weapon by the muzzle and snatched it away
the ruffian struck out with his clenched fist guy evaded the blow and brought the butt of the revolver down on his antagonists head
the man fell sideways cursing and groaning
dropping the weapon so that he could use his hand guy gripped the saddlehorn shoved his left foot into the stirrup and was quickly astride the horse
let go he shouted hoarsely to the man at the horses head
the command was not obeyed
from a leather loop about wrist hung the whip
catching the stock of it he threw himself along the horses neck and cut the man across the face with the lash
a howl of pain followed the blow and the man released the bitrings
by then the others were fast closing around but guy lashed the horse and the animal sprang through the cordon of men and away
bullets followed
they flew wild for the most part although one tore its way through the brim of his hat
with young luther in front his own body protecting him guy raced past the last house
nobly done cried a voice a voice that thrilled him in every fibre
he threw an astonished glance ahead and mid way of the distance that separated him from the with young i uther 1n front guy raced past the last house page 28o
reaping the whirlwind i white heap where the women and children had taken refuge saw miss betty her foamflecked horse at a standstill
there was fire in the girls eyes and her face was ruddy with excitement
betty l he gasped
you here tried to overtake you and warn you not to come here she answered but it seems i arrived too late
a telegram reached concord from ami tyville asking for help
barney is getting the invincibles then help will come
before long
he cast a hurried look over his shoulder
the enraged jamestown men were following brandish ing their weapons and clenched fists and giving vent to cries of baffled rage
they want me he said facing about hastily and perhaps you are mounted she broke in and can distance them easily
ride for harmony l and abandon those women and children he returned canot do that betty
as i say those fellows are after me and perhaps i can hold their attention until the invincibles get here
take this boy to his mother i must ride in an other direction
she was proud proud of his bravery and proud that he remembered the women and children when she had for the moment forgotten them
some thing of this pride must have shone in her eyes for a gleam of happiness crossed the young mans face
his friend the enemy care for the boy she said in a hurried tone
you take these and mind protect your self at any cost
there was no time for further words
betty took charge of young luther and guy the cart ridgebelt over the saddlehorn and the gun in one hand whirled and galloped for a second heap of buffalo bones on the south side of the town
just as he had anticipated the angry men followed him and deep in his heart he thanked god that this before the attacking force had come within a hundred feet of him guy had dismounted buckled the bridlereins about a buffalo skull made the cartridgebelt fast about his waist and was peer ing over his makeshift breastworks the shotgun at his shoulder
back he cried sternly shoot the first man that advances another step
the leader of the jamestown men was jordan a tall evilfaced ruffian whom guy knew by sight
he was the least intoxicated and at the same time the most determined of all the trouble makers
over his shoulder he carried a repeating rifle and his fingers seemed itching to make mur derous use of it
at command to halt jordan threw up one hand and ordered his com panions to obey
this is a groundhog case for you herbert said he with a wicked leer twenty against you and the only way you can save your reaping the whirlwind life is by shellin out the twentyfour hundred dollars thats due us
eh boys
jordan appealed to his companions who an swered with a clamorous affirmative havenot even twentyfour hundred cents about me the young man returned
then well make a prisoner of you and keep you until your friends send the money
keever hired you guy called back and you followed his instructions and voted against con cord
why should i pay you a cent
you will all the same
will you come out from behind that bonepile and give yourself up
then were goin to surround you
i donot believe that old pepperbox of yours can cover the whole twenty of us
it will cover enough of you to make your move a dangerous one was the cool response
jordan was thoughtful for a moment and then the demands for action vociferously led by the two rascals who had already suffered at hands prompted him to begin operations
circle round back of the bonepile you fellows over there cried jordan waving his hand to wards the right
and you on the left he added facing towards that point do the same thing
spread out and keep your guns ready l the right and left wings of the small army be gan a cautious and unsteady advance
guy had no intention of allowing himself to be surrounded his friend the enemy and attacked by flank and rear where the breast works would prove of no protection
he watched sharply and when the two men at the points of the half circle were opposite him on left and right he stood up fearlessly and gave them a barrel on each side
the charges did no more than plump into the ground at the feet of the men farthest in advance but the effect of the two shots was start ling
the crescent contracted as if by magic the men staggering and stumbling towards jordan and clustering about him
their leader swore at them taunted them with cowardice and did every thing in his power to urge them on but they felt safer in solid formation
a brisk fire was opened on the bonepile and splinters flew in all directions
guy remained in plain view while reloading the shotgun and then calmly dropped from sight
this skirmish took place within sight of the women and children who watched it breathlessly and with blanching faces
betty sitting rigidly erect in her saddle curbed her plunging horse mechanically and kept her eyes on stalwart form until having reloaded the gun he sank be hind the white heap
then she turned a wild im ploring look behind her along the harmony road
why donot they come why donot they come she murmured again and again in anguished tones
abruptly the firing ceased daughter is over there with the rest of those women guy heard jordan say and if we could capture her reaping the whirlwind the plan was tumultuously approved mainly because an attack on unarmed women and chil dren was attended with no danger heart leaped into his throat
betty was well mounted and could flee from danger
something whispered to the young man however that she would not abandon the women and children but would cast her lot with them
what would the drunken wretches do
what might they not do
pettibone was right when he said that an un scrupulous man with a grievance was an engine of destruction
and such a man inflamed with liquor had his power for evil increased a hundred fold
with maudlin shouts the gang turned and started towards the northeast
the women saw them coming and thinking the attack was upon them all screamed and crushed helplessly together
betty rode to them and guy heard her calm authoritative voice although he could not dis tinguish her words
whatever the words were they had a reassuring effect and the women re treated to the protection of the boneheap while betty entirely selfpossessed and fearless swerved her horse about and rode forward to meet the 1men
it was beautiful and intrepid but the useless ness of it wrenched a groan from lips
she was deceived
she thought the cowardly pack were charging upon the defenseless women and did not dream that she alone was the object of their his friend the enemy attack
with no thought for his own safety guy leaped over the white mound in front of him and started after the hooting and howling mob trying to capture you betty l he shouted at the top of his voice
turn your horseride like the my god
while the warning was upon his lips the spirited horse frightened by the noise and the sight of the onrushing men broke from its riders control reared high and fell backward another instant and it was up and careering away with an empty saddle
betty was somewhere among that horde of men hurt perhaps dying for a second the blood con gealed in veins and he stood like one dazed
but only for a second
a savage strength leaped suddenly into his limbs every nerve stretched to tightest tension and his brain seemed on fire
with a furious cry he plunged into the crowd of men and battled his way to side
she lay on the turf like a trodden lily her face as the face of one dead
stand back you cowards you fiends you murderers l shouted guy in a delirium of rage
catching the shotgun by the barrel he whirled it around and around leaping at the closing circle of ruffians like a madman
he forced them back by the very impetuosity of his assault and as he stood before them panting and aflame with pas sion a buzzing sound came from the railroad track and died away in a fall of distant hoofs
reaping the whirlwind pettibone was coming on a velocipede bone and waffle and comfort and back along the harmony road was a cloud of dust
the invincibles guy tottered groaned dropped the gun and clutched at his shoulder
yes they were coming but coming too late staggering to side he fell on his knees and lifted her head in his arms
it was for his sake that she had come there she had followed after him to warn him and for him alone was this sacrifice he bent his head and pressed his hot lips to her brow
verily they had reaped the whirlwind for guy the events that followed swiftly upon the coming of the sheriff and the invincibles had all the hazy unreality of a dream
his heart and brain were benumbed as a consequence of the shocking accident to betty
the passing of his angry outburst against the jamestown men left him nerveless and overwhelmed and of what he saw and heard he remembered little
he had a glimpse of pettibone shouldering through the drunken crowd and tearing away guns and revolvers he saw col dingle charge upon the scene and deploy his mounted men in a circle about the mob and then some one dashed up in a carriage and sprang to the ground with a griefstricken cry
it was the squire
the next moment he had caught betty out of arms
the young man arose mechanically
dingle gal loped to the spot dismounted and hurried to the squire and betty
he exchanged some words with the squire and presently turned on guy who stood near with stony eyes
he spoke but guy did not hear
again he spoke shaking guy by the shoul ders to arouse him from his lethargy
his friend the enemy her horse was frightened by the jamestown men said guy in colorless tones it reared back and must have fallen on her
dingle whirled about at a sharp command from the squire then the squire got into the carriage dingle lifted betty to him climbed in himself and drove towards harmony lashing the horse into a guy felt a hand on his shoulder
withdrawing his eyes from the disappearing carriage he turned and saw waffle
waffle was talking and his hand had fallen from shoulder to his breast
her horse must have fallen on her said guy passing one hand slowly across his forehead
she came here to warn me and she could have ridden away in safety but she would not leave the women and children
he fell heavily against waffle who threw an arm about him to keep him upright
pettibone ran to them spoke hurriedly with waffle and at once called some one behind him
bill comfort ap peared placed himself at side and as sisted in supporting guy
then they walked to the railroad track and the young man was helped to a seat in the velocipede car
there were three seats and two of themthe ones taken by waffle and the machinery that furnished the motive power
applying themselves to the foot and hand levers waffle and comfort sent the car eastward at racehorse speed
guy felt as though they were winged and cleav conclusion ing the air
the click click of the rails died away the broad back of waffle bending to its work vanished by degrees and the red face of bill com fort lifting and falling receded farther and farther into a cloudlike haze
guy was in the gorgeous trap with miss betty riding from to willowview
the mel low jingle of the harness chains mingled with the silver notes of birds winging about them and singing to them as they passed
his heart throbbed with its awakening passion and his eyes drank in the beauty of sky and earth
the yel low flowers and the dull gold of hair the blue of the wild violets and the blue of her eyes the mantling blush of the prairie rose and the delicate tint of her cheeks were as one to him in that delicious hour of peace and happiness and budding love
again he was in willowview and small hands were flitting over the piano keys while he stood at her side and watched her face and list ened to her voice his heartstrings swept by the master passion and echoing melody for melody and song for song
his fancy was unfettered and leaped from one bright hour to another backward or forward hoarding its happiness as a miser hoards treasure counting the golden moments one by one
in time his wayward thoughts rode into amity ville plucked young luther from the midst of the jamestown men and carried him from the town his friend the enemy and delivered him to betty
once more he fought his battle at the bonepile and again he witnessed the dread spectacle that racked him body and sinking from sight the front hoofs of her horse beating the air as they shot upward and whirled back
then as before he fought the horde singlehanded and drifted back to earth in a small room with pettibone and waffle holding him down on a bed by main force
it was night
a lamp burned on a table and guy marveling at the quick change of scene straightened out and lay quietly be all right now said pettibone
sit down waff or if you want to go i guess i can manage him
waffle took a chair house is this pettibone
guy asked
mine herbert replied the sheriff
feel bet ter the matter with me
that wound in your shoulder opened and you bled a considerable
waff and comfort brought you here and i rode back on your horse after attendin to that batch of hoodlums been out of your head and babblin all kinds of talk but you didnot get violent till a few minutes ago i tell you waff and i had it which and tother keeping you where you belonged the truth put in the judge but youll do from this on herbert
a man with as conclusion much fight in him as youve got wonot be long on the sick list
bettymiss vlandingham guy turned a glance upon the sheriff an icy hand clutching his throat and choking him his eyes finishing the unspoken question
rest easy about miss vlandingham was the cheery response stopped at the on my way back and was told that a dislocated shoulder and a sprained ankle was about all she had to get over
it might have been a whole lot worse said the judge philosophically
god knows l affirmed the sheriff
guy closed his eyes reverently grateful to the mighty hand that had averted the dire calamity he feared in his soul
betty would live
he whispered it over and over to himself and the knowledge thrilled and rejoiced him as nothing else on earth could have done
that little war over the countyseat had been a play an opera bouffe performance that had wellnigh turned out a tragedy
but the curtain was down on the final act the reckoning had been paid and betty would live
two months passed two months fraught with many changes for the town of concord
first came the news that coal had been discov his friend the enemy ered of good quality and apparently in unlimited quantities
it was known to underlie the whole townsite as well as the adjacent country for many miles to the north east and south
westward however the vein grew thinner and of poorer quality and finally gave out altogether
the carboniferous age had worked its miracles for concord but had turned its venerable back on harmony
in a treeless country where the rigors of winter are as keen as in the dakotas this discovery of coal meant muchmeant everything in factand concord was brought prominently before the at tention of the whole territory
soon it became known that young mr herbert had interested a capitalist in the new fields this capitalist had interested other men of wealth and they had formed a company incorporated and known as the concord coal land company
it developed later that this company had pur chased from mr herbert the concord townsite giving him therefor the sum of twenty thousand dollars together with a paidup interest entitling him to onefifth of all profits arising from the companys operations in real estate and mines
coal lands were secured right and left bought for cash leased or worked on a percentage as the original holders of the lands might desire
a boom was started not a flurry of high prices based on fictitious values and kept alive by greed and excitement but a prosperous advance along conclusion the lines of sound business and pure commer cialism
entire columns in the various territorial papers were given over to concord and one bismarck daily referred to the town as the new mecca
these reports created a profound impression everywhere and the people of amityville with all their household goods in bonewagons traveled eastward in one grand hegira and were among the first newcomers to reach the new mecca
they had a surplusage of lots and each family after reserving a lot for a house sold the rest for enough to build the house
the men were practi cal coal miners and quickly identified themselves with the operations of the coal company
the erection of new stores along the main street was begun and the townsite was checkered with piles of yellow lumber
the demand for buildings brought a demand for masons car penters plasterers laborers and strangers poured into the town by every train
pedro smith was overwhelmed by the crush another hotel was built and then another and another
a news paper rose from the ruins of the blizzard under the guidance of a snappy little man with a corn cob pipea man who was frankly commercial severely plain and had an aversion for any word that outranked three syllables
he succeeded so well that another paper of different political stripe intruded into the field and was able to live and circulate and make money for its promoters
his friend the enemy another druggist came to rival pinney a second livery stable opened its broad doors directly across the street from leffingwell and the empo rium found itself in mad competition with no less than four other establishments of the same kind
when the finger of capital touches the button of business every artery responds to the electric thrill
the wave of energy that swept over con cord grew to tidal proportions and the town was all but swamped in prosperity
the reader will wonder and no doubt be pleased to learn that squire vlandingham had a profitable share in the good fortune that descended upon concord
this came as an indirect result of the evil doings of the jamestown men and happened in this wise the rioters quelled by the sheriff with the aid of the invincibles were loaded into a box car and shipped to concord
they were there tried before judge waffle who in his usual refreshing manner fined them for all damages inflicted upon the amityville store and contents together with a tidy sum for costs
then it was that squire vlanding ham stepped forward and paid the fines and costs deducting the sum total from the wages due and dividing the balance among the twenty men share and share alike
the rascals were there upon returned by first train to their native place the amityville storekeeper was remunerated for his trying experience and the incident was closed
guy offered to give his note to the squire for conclusion the twentyfour hundred dollars but the offer was peremptorily refused
guy then desired to present the squire with a block of concord lots in lieu of the note and the squire not knowing that the reign of king coal was about to begin and thinking the lots practically worthless pacified the persistent young man by accepting a deed
in the end the holdings in a supposedly dead town netted him more than the entire harmony townsite
as for young herbert he awoke one fine morn ing to find himself richand famous
whenever he walked the streets old settlers were proud to grasp his hand and chat with him about things present and to come and whenever one of these old settlers presented a stranger who had sought the new mecca in quest of an opening the accepted formula was mr herbert mr
so
then to mr the old timer would add with swelling chest and brightening eye mr herbert you know found the coal thats under us and is the father of our little city
for a few times this introduction could be borne with but it cloyed with constant repetition
the hum of industry busily at work on the raw materials of a new town was also more or less distracting
and for these as well as for other good and valid reasons guy fell to making peri odical pilgrimages to harmony where he was always certain of a bright welcome at willowview
miss betty recovered from her accident but his friend the enemy slowly
a month passed before she was able to leave the house and then it was great pleasure one sunny afternoon to take her for a drive into the country heard so much about concord during the last few weeks remarked miss betty as they drove along that i shall be glad when i am able to go there and see for myself just what is being done
if you were now to pass through the town on the sixthirty freight miss vlandingham smiled guy assure you that you would be able to count more than three people from the waycar suppose so she answered laughing softly poor harmony has been quite eclipsed
you have done wonderful things for concord since you came to the town mr herbert
now returned guy gruesomely please donot add that i discovered the coal thats under us and am the father of our little city
i run when ever i hear that been told how strangers are invariably presented to you she said with a ripple of merri ment then suddenly sobering she added you are popular with every one and i am glad very glad
that set formula is hardly a test of popu larity guy answered
the very men who now overpower me with their attentions are the ones who put me under lock and key for the good of the town shrieked traitor at me and at one conclusion time suggested a telegraph pole and several feet of stout rope
the source of popularity is success said miss betty and you have been marvelously suc cessful
an accident entirely averred guy
no she cried and her eyes flashed as they turned upon him you shall not wrong yourself by calling your success an accident donot want to be loaded with more honor than i deserve miss vlandingham said he and i donot want to take a false position in any ones eyes yours least of all
some one would have discovered coal in concord sooner or later and was it not an accident that the destruction of the blizzard building revealed it to me
if an accident why did not pettibone discover the coal she asked
his eyes were not so sharp as mine i suppose
no nor his mind so acute
only one man could do for concord what has been done and that man is guy herbert
it pleased him to hear her say that and in just the tone of voice she used
you are a great man in concord she pur sued but that does not satisfy me
i want you to be a great man in north dakota
north dakota he echoed
yes
the territory is to be divided and will be admitted as two states
my father as you may know is high in the councils of his party and he 3oo his friend the enemy knows all that is being done
when north dakota is admitted as a state she will be entitled to repre sentation in both branches of congress
that will be a chance for the popular mr herbert of concord betty l exclaimed guy
it is in you to do great things she con tinued with supreme conviction and you must do them
it is your duty
her face was earnest but he felt that she was laughing at him with her eyes
you are looking too far ahead he said jest ingly
the gentleman from north dakota will no doubt appear in the legislative halls of our country at some future day but i doubt very much whether he will be herbert of concord
the young state will need men she answered with great seriousness not politicians but up right and resourceful men
your star is in the ascendant mr herbert
suddenly she started looked about her and laid one gloved hand on his arm
can you tell me sir where you are driv ing she asked
there were no houses visible anywhere on the broad plain
a little distance ahead and to the right of the road there was a moundlike ruin which looked as though it might once have been a dwelling havenot the slightest idea said he
what is that in front of us miss betty
can you tell me
he pointed with the whip as he spoke
conclusion 3o i yes she returned her voice low her gaze on the ruin and a suggestion of sadness and mel ancholy in her manner
that is the old sod shack where will used to live mound behind it is his grave
that hark
she raised one hand and bowed her head her lips parted her eyes dreamy her whole manner rapt and breathless
do you not hear it she whis pered
what he asked wonderingly drawing the horse to a halt burst of music falling from up there she flashed a glance at the sky above them never pass here that i do not hear some violin playing the rose of allan dale he recalled mention of lonesome will and his voice was soft as he answered cannot hear the music betty
perhaps i might if i knew the story
please tell me
her face was divinely sweet and her voice in effably gentle as she told him of lonesome will
those ruined walls mr herbert once sheltered a sad and solitary man
he had no companions he shunned the society of his fellowmen and lived out a life that was beautiful in its very sadness
i say he had no companions and yet he did have onea companion that communed with and com forted his grieving hearta violin
and the air that old instrument knew best was the rose of allandale
his friend the enemy once lonesome will had loved a fairhaired faithful girl whose name was rose
a love strong as fetters of iron yet soft as a gossamer web had sprung up between them
in life they lived for each other and when by inscrutable decree the earthly rose was taken to blossom in heaven the lover continued to live for his dead
how long and dreary must have been the years that passed over the head of lonesome will with only his violin to solace him and dis tract his mind from his loss what wonder that he poured forth his soul in a melody that grew divine beneath his inspired fingers the psalmist says that weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
and so it was with lonesome will
he was found dead one day his old fiddle in one hand and the bow in the other
we all knew what must have been the last melody played by his dying hands and she paused a moment
the violin was buried with him she finished abruptly
there fell a silence
something there was about the story about the way it was told or the teller of it or the time and place that affected the young man powerfully
he urged the horse forward
at the very wall of the ruin he stopped again got out of the carriage and assisted betty to alight
she did not question the meaning of his act
no words passed between them
eye may have spoken to eye and heart to heart but the lips were mute
together conclusion hand in hand they entered the old doorway and stood within the roofless walls
as under a spell they listened for the music listened with that soulful ear which attunes itself to the infinite
while they stood their glances roved about them and in the selfsame moment they saw something which caused them to start and gaze at each other with eyes filled with a divine mystery
a rose bush grew out of the old wall and there before them blossomed a fullblown rose they passed over to it and betty went down on her knees and brushed her lips against the petals
guy knelt beside her
betty he whispered is it not type and emblem of that supernal blossom which lone some will gained after many years in paradise
few men love as lonesome will loved she murmured
betty here on ground hallowed by such loy alty may i not speak of my love for you
dear one you are the world and all to me
you are planning my future and i would make myself all that you would have me but your own future must be a part of mine
she started erect with averted face
still kneel ing he caught her hand love you betty with all my heart and soul
i am not worthy of you but guy she cried turning on him her face glow ing with happiness and her eyes misty with tears his friend the enemy why will you say such a thing
you are worthy worthy of the best woman that ever lived
my hero my king she held out her arms and he arose and caught her passionately to his breast
my hearts idol he murmured kissing her eyes her cheeks her lips in an ecstasy of passion
you love me then
tell me sweetheart love you she murmured her face against his breast love you i love you hear the music betty he whispered listen l
