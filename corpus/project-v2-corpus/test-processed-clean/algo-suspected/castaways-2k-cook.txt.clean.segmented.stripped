castaways of the year william wallace gook the timecoupe which brought back to the year six of the twentyone who had gone in it to the year having been destroyed by a bolt of lightning fifteen of the number are marooned a century ahead of their own times
meanwhile dr kelpie inventor of the coupe has mysteriously disappeared and gig lindley is arrested on the charge of having abducted him
the members of the relief and rescue society for the castaways of the year go to dr residence on an urgent summons from his man chester
here they find the man from who with the timeball an invention of the twentyfirst century says he has come back to transport the members of the society to their friends in the year jasper kinch detective insists on tod brother jefferson accompanying them and the five of them cover a century in ten minutes to find themselves sprawled on the floor and the man from vanished
then a door opens and none other than the missing dr kelpie appears lama prisoner of the era he tells them
you are all prisoners
there is treachery afoot and little hope for any of us
it appears that the fifteen prisoners of the twentyfirst century have taken possession of the government and are running things in their own way
in seeking to escape everson lumley author of the possibilities of the subconscious ego becomes separated from the others and is rescued by kennedy who in company with horton are discoursing with him about the edict of the usurpers that vaporized foods shall be replaced by the oldfashioned masticated sort
suddenly there is the thump of an airship alighting on the roof
at sight of one of the two arrivals heart fails him as a wave of remembrance rolls over his brain like an icy flood
why oh why had he not fallen before the electric guns of the guards
lumley asked himself
why had he been spared to be brought face to face with the daughter of kennedy dismay at that moment was somewhat tempered by surprise
following miss tibijul into the room was none other than jefferson plunkett
lumley had become acquainted with miss tibijul on the occasion of his first visit to the year the business of courtship in those times had been almost entirely taken over by the fair sex and lumley was wooed by miss tibijul with a dogged persistency that wellnigh drove him distracted
up to the last exciting moment of his previous sojourn in lumley had been harassed by the unwelcome began october argosy
back numbers for sale at this office attentions of miss tibijul
strange that he should have forgotten her even at the time when he had found himself under her fathers roof
somehow as lumley looked at jefferson plunkett and made note of the kindly consideration with which the lady favored him his fears began to wane
plunkett seemed entirely disorganized
there was a blank look in his face and an uncertain light in his eyes
miss tibijul took his hand and led him to a couch
poor man she murmured commiseratingly youre all unstrung and no wonder
do sit down and rest
you are perfectly safe here
plunkett turned upon her a vacant stare
he did not speak but slowly lifted a hand and drew it across his forehead
gently miss tibijul pushed him down on the soft cushions behind him
he submitted passively
daughter cried kennedy in consternation what does this mean
we are already courting destruction by harboring one of the escaped hostages and now unless my eyes deceive me you bring in another
i saved him answered miss tibijul proudly and a bit defiantly
i was out for an afternoon fly in the beetle and i saw this poor gentleman below a number of guards with electric guns pursuing him closely
i dropped down and took him aboard
and the guards got the number of your airship i presume chided her father
a pretty situation i must say hortense
the dictators will be after us and so will our own people
but theres no use arguing with a woman
who is ahis man
jefferson plunkett father
you are mistaken about our danger being increased by what i have done
this gentleman is the brother of the chief dictator
in rescuing him this afternoon i have won for all of us here the gratitude of our worst enemy
we the ladys words faded from her lips
she had been taking a survey of the room and her eyes began to snap and sparkle behind the boxlike spectacles that covered them
well dear me she exclaimed stepping forward with outstretched hand
here is my old friend everson lumley back again from the other century
the times have changed for the worse mr lumley since you honored us with your first visit
it was merely a friendly pressure which miss tibijul gave hand
he experienced a tremendous relief
after all the lady had had only a passing fancy for him and it was plain that the fancy had gone never to return heart expanded with hope am glad to see you again
miss tibijul he said and miss hortense kennedy the lady interrupted
edict no by the dictator of customs changed every name in new york
i wish to thank you kennedy lumley proceeded for saving mr jefferson plunkett
we were all quite worried about him
as soon as i took him aboard the beetle he asked me to hurry to street station
what did he mean he is an incredulous person explained lumley and refuses to believe that he has been transported from oi to the following century
i knew something was wrong with him declared miss kennedy
he needs the gentlest treatment or the shock of full realization will unbalance his mind
she went over and sat down on the couch beside plunkett you understand jefferson she cooed that nearly a hundred years have passed since yesterday
plunkett lifted his hands and felt wonderingly of the upthrust braids capped with the gaudy ribbons
then suddenly he broke into a maundering laugh
what a funny dream he exclaimed
as miss kennedy drew back impelled by some unpleasant inference drawn from the words plunkett arose and let his eyes wander about the room
the shadows had begun to fall and horton passed to a table and uncapped the tin of condensed light he had brought with him into the room
a sunny glow diffused itself about the place and plunkett rubbed his double chin thoughtfully he mused can you beat it
chased by guards with electric guns picked up by something out of a comic supplement carried off in an air ship brought down through the roofdoor of a house and now some one illuminates by opening a tin can
ouch
this is getting so deuced serious that it hurts
wonder if going dippy
wish i could get an expert medical opinion
lumley prompted by a generous instinct to reassure a distressed mind came forward
mr plunkett he asked donot you remember me you a wild bellow came from plunkett
know you he cried thickly you think for a minute by james that ever let you slip out of my mind here and youre alone i guess thats enough for me
with that he bore down upon lumley his face black with anger and his fat fists clenched
miss kennedy screamed and wrung her hands
horton threw a chair in front of plunkett over which he tripped and went crashing to the floor
kennedy seized lumley by the arm
come with me lumley he whispered excitedly
the man will kill you if i donot get you out of the way
lumley regretted the circumstances while yielding to the force of them
giving himself into hands he was conducted into a dark passage and finally into a sleeping apartment
here kennedy pressed a button which opened electrically a can of light fixed in a wallsocket and then he closed and secured the door
greatly perturbed he walked up and down the room while lumley dropped upon the bed and reclined there to await further developments
there is no peace no happiness for any of us since those dictators have been promulgating their decrees said kennedy finally coming wearily to a halt and facing his guest
nothing goes as it should even the ordinary course of events continually develops one thing after another to keep a new yorker of the period in a nervous condition
everything is being changed and changed for the worse
lumley had a soft heart and felt keenly for his friend
there was little that he could say however and so he held his peace
when you were here before lumley pursued kennedy muglugs did all the work for us
we had house muglugs factory muglugs air ship muglugs and so on so that it was necessary for us simply to speak and our orders were obeyed by tireless automatons of steel
now these drudges have been taken away from us and we are obliged to work with our own hands even and his voice filled with bitterness have my back yard filled with pig iron and am compelled to manufacture rain plugs for the weather department
this manual labor is sapping the life out of me is a change very soon i shall pine away under my misfortunes
this latest edict from the food department caps a climax
i cannot offer you supper lumley for there is not a particle of vaporized food in the house and i would not give you any if there were morning i shall try and have a breakfast according to the anchient culinary standards but i canmot promise you anything even passable
my chef brown has one of these cookbooks the dictators have forced on us and the mere reading of half a dozen recipes sent him into a swoon
so i have my doubts about that morning meal
now friend lumley there are a great many things i must talk with you aboutand not the least of these pressing topics is this man jefferson plunkett and his hostile attitude toward youbut i am in no condition this evening to discuss matters of importance if you please we will consider your case in all its bearings
meantime let me urge you to get a good nights rest
you are obliged to go supperless to bed but the dictators are responsible for that
he moved toward the door
horton and i will take care of plunkett he went on but it will be just as well for you to lock the door after me
pm obliged to you mr kennedy said lumley for your kindness to me
before i try to rest though like to pick up a few transmits about my scattered friends badly worried and the information regarding your friends is incomplete and unsatisfactory interrupted kennedy
probably it will be tomorrow morning before we can secure anything definite
have courage and patience lumley
those on our side wonot dare do anything desperate and of course your friends have nothing to fear from the dictators
good night my friend
kennedy passed from the room and lumley locked the door behind him and went to bed
on his previous visit to those luxurious times every household had muglugs for menials
each guest had a dapper little muglug valet to serve him and throughout the establishment there were steel servants to fetch and carry
lumley was having the striking changes in the year brought home to him in a most telling manner and his mind dwelt upon the subject for an hour or two before he went to sleep
at last he dropped over the edge of consciousness and began swimming through a sea of dreams
now he was confronting electric guns that belched their thunderbolts in his face and now he was frantically pursuing the timeball and the chain of a hundred links through frightful centuries
again he was tormented by the amazonian attentions of miss tibijul otherwise hortense kennedy or was strapped in the iron chair of the thinkograph or was battling to the death with jefferson plunkett
the fight with plunkett came along at the end of his dreaming
he had struck at the fat hardware salesman and missed with a taunting laugh the salesman had let drive at him with conspicuous success
the blow landed with a crash and ears were still ringing as he opened his eyes
he discovered that he was sitting up in bed with fists doubled
it was broad daylight and he drew a long breath of relief as he realized that he had been the victim of a nightmare
then the next moment he realized too that some one was pounding on his door
lumley
wake up lumley
it was the voice of kennedy and was fairly crackling with excitement wanted inquired lumley
let me inhurry in danger lumley
lumley rolled out of bed and made haste to open the door
kennedy very much out of breath staggered across the threshold
his face was ominous and heart sank
what has gone wrong kennedy he gasped
jefferson plunkett has been using the transmit panted kennedy
horton showed him how to use the thoughtwaves and plunkett sent out word broadcast over the city that you were being harbored in my house
the man must be crazy
get into your clothes lumley as quickly as possible
this last admonition was useless for lumley was already pawing wildly at his garments
kennedy helped him
what am i to do faltered lumley
i havenot been able to think of anything as yet was the response hoping that some of the muglug army will get here before the guards and that kennedy paused
a thump on the roof announced the alighting of an airship
a moment more and the voice of horton came piercingly from a distance the guards are here kennedy
the house is surrounded and a detachment has just landed on the roofstaging and captured plunkett
just then horton showed his wild face in the door
better surrender lumley he advised theres really nothing else to be done not surrender hints flung back kennedy
come on lumley donot stop to put on your shoes
with a shoe in each hand lumley bolted after his host
out in the hall they could hear the scuffling footsteps of the guards racing through the rooms in a furious search
this way whispered kennedy and made off along the passage
an exultant cry came from somewhere in the rear
they see you exclaimed horton
you are mad kennedy to try to the words were lost
kennedy had rushed through a door jerked lumley after him and then slammed the door and shot a bolt
an idea murmured kennedy
i can save you lumley but we shall have to be quick
save me echoed lumley in a panic
how
this is the pneumatic tuberoom
from this point we send and receive packages from all over the city
here
he stepped to one side of the chamber
in the wall some two feet from the floor was a round opening closed with a metal disk
above the disk was a transmitknob
just below the disk was a trestlework topped with a bed of small rollers
upon the rollers lay a cylinder six feet long by eighteen inches in diameter
the cylinder was pointed at each end and halved and hinged lengthwise so that the upper half opened like a lid
the long lid was thrown back and lumley could see that the cylinder was empty
get into it instructed kennedy sharply it repeated lumley recoiling
yes your only chance
be quick
lumley climbed to the staging and squeezed himself into the cylinder
there was plenty of room up and down but a tight fit across
kennedy meanwhile was striking the transmitknob
well came a voice
a hundred and thirty pounds of rainplugs for the weather bureau called kennedy
rush order
the way is clear
load the rairvplugs intothe tube
kennedy pulled a lever
the circular disk vanished and revealed the maw of a black opening
with a smothered exclamation lumley sat up in the steel shell
what are you going to do with me kennedy he asked tremulously
send you to your friends by pneumatic tube was the answer
but rather not go to my friends in that way
i a rain of blows dashed against the closed door and a clamor of voices demanded the surrender of lumley
with a hollow groan lumley fell backward and wedged himself into the cylinder
swiftly kennedy closed the cover and clamped it down
an awful feeling of helplessness and peril took possession of everson lumley
what if the cylinder should get blocked in the tube
how long would the air inside the steel shell support life
suppose he gave over his direful suppositions abruptly
the rollers were turning beneath the cylinder and he felt that he was moving forward into the hole in the wall
a roar of air in violent suction filled his ears
a second later his head was driven into the rear point of the cylinder as he started suddenly and rushed at the weather bureau like a bullet from a gun miles jernyngham weather lumley was too dazed to note when or how the cylinder came to a pause
he was conscious of some one working at the upper half of the shell and was presently blinking in a bright light as the lid was thrown back
he heard a yell of consternation and a patter of running feet then an excited voice mr jernyngham
mr jernyngham
hush that clamor simpson came a second voice and one of authority the row anyway
come here please mr jernyngham
there are no rainplugs in that cylinder from kennedy lumley heard a rumble of anger from jernyngham and a movement in his direction
he sat up
jernyngham and simpson were close
jernyngham recoiled and simpson gave another yell and pressed fearfully back against the wall
suffering cyclones exclaimed jernyngham recovering himself
everson lumley or a hottentot
good morning miles said lumley cheerfully justhad a narrow escape
you see the guards were after me and kennedy had to load me into the cylinder and fire me through the tube
how are you
miles jernyngham embraced his unexpected guest with great ardor remember kennedy for that he declared
confound that bloomer brigade anyhow no rime or reason in the way theyre acting
but theyll get enough of it before were done with them
tickled to death to see you old man
come into the office and tell me all about it
lumley fished his shoes out of the cylinder and turned to follow the weather dictator out of the tuberoom
get a grip on yourself simpson laughed jernyngham as he passed his assistant
i donot wonder that you were taken aback when you looked for rainplugs and found my old friend everson lumley hot in syracuse and they want a few clouds
as soon as they shoot in a hundred dollars push a couple of cloudplugs into the syracuse section
very well sir answered simpson slowly recovering his mental poise
the way from the tuberoom to the office carried lumley and the dictator through a large chamber in which three meeklooking men of the period were at work
a large map of the state of new york had been split into three sections and fastened to three blank walls
every town village and crossroads was plainly marked and the entire surface was gouged with holes
some of these holes were empty
others were filled with roundheaded plugs of different colors
on his way through the room jernyngham paused and cast a critical eye over one of the sections
i guess youd better pull out that steuben county plug arnold said he already given them more rain than theyve paid for
and i want you to be more careful with the galeplugs arnold
herkimer county didnot whackup for that last spell of fair weather and i told you to switch in one galeplug and you switched in two
i just heard that you unroofed three stores in coldbrook and blew over a steeple in fairfield
be a little more careful or youll get your walkingpapers
jernyngham passed on into the office and closed the door after lumley a great graft lumley this weather business grinned jernyngham in high good humor as he motioned his guest to a chair said lumley sitting down and beginning to get into his shoes is it right miles to make a graft of it
why not
before we took hold the weather business was in the hands of a trust driven out the trusts cornered the muglugs and set the people to work
we charge only half what the trust charged for weather and everybody ought to be satisfied
glad to hear you have cut the prices but driving out one trust and replacing it with another isnot just the thing is it
and in the case of a public necessity like the weather shouldnot the government have control what it has grinned jernyngham were the government in the state of new york
but we wonot discuss this at present hungry and was just going to have breakfast
join me and well talk as we eat
simpson he shouted
simpson appeared in the door of the chartroom
double that breakfast order said jernyngham
two portions ham and eggs
by the way lumley how do you like your eggs
turned over answered lumley brightening with pleasant anticipations
remember that simpson went on jernyngham
double up on the fried potatoes the buttered toast and the coffee
also lay covers for two for i have and here he gave a droll wink a hundred and thirty pounds of rainplugs to breakfast with me
simpson smiled faintly and withdrew
jernyngham lifted his feet to the top of his desk and tilted back comfortably in his officechair
we kept track of you fairly well yesterday by means of the transmits said he up to the time you vanished in back yard
what happened to you after that lumley recounted his experiences
as he talked he watched simpson setting a table with white linen blue china and shining spoons and cutlery
these preparations in view of the fact that he had had a vaporized dinner the day before and no supper cheered him tremendously
throughout the recital jernyngham gave lumley his absorbed attention
whew exclaimed the weather dictator when the story was done you fellows did have a time of it and no mistake
smith was a pestiferous person and i am glad he has been put out of the way
but your situation lumley was not so perilous as it appeared
those guards would never have dared to annihilate you with their electric guns
they knew too well that the vengeance of the dictators would be swift and sure
if you men have the whole city under your control asked lumley how is it possible for any of the citizens of the period to defy your authority
that was because they had dr kelpie explained jernyngham
they used the doctor as a club threatening him with death if we did not give up the important posts we occupy
finding their threats would not intimidate us
smith used the doctors timemachine to go back into the past after more of you fellows
the situation was becoming pretty jerry dicks evolved that plot to help you escape
we know now why you anticipated activities
of course were not out of the woods yet by a long shot but were going to hang on to our powers and prerogatives great lumley for a bunch of year men to boss this year if you had a hand in the game youd know how we feel have to leave these times miles said lumley
we came to rescue you and youve got to go back with us
jernyngham shook his head you believe it doing a splendid work here and tod plunkett is planning to extend our power over the whole country never leave lumley
but what will happen to gig lindley cried lumley
i guess he will have to be sacrificed
the greatest good for the greatest number is our slogan
the horror lumley felt was too deep for words
but it was not a time to argue the point for he was hungry and a hungry mans mind is not at its best
where are the rest of our friends who escaped with me he inquired and lindley were picked up by an airship belonging to the department of customs kinch and mortimer were rescued by a detachment of muglugs under command of jerry dicks
now that you and jefferson plunkett are accounted for the only man missing is dr kelpie
i presume that he and plunkett are in the hands of the guards
at this moment simpson began bringing in a number of covered dishes and placing them on the table
the appetizing odor he brought with him was most delightful
his final act was to place half a dozen cigars in the center of the table and push up a couple of chairs
all ready sir he announced
come lumley said jernyngham and got up and started toward the table
lumley was smiling and rubbing his hands
he was very certain that never in his whole life had he been so nearly famished as he was at that moment
they paused on their way to the table startled by cries from the chartroom
before jernyngham could investigate the cause of the commotion a short fat man came puffing through the office door
his face was red and his little eyes glimmered
in one hand he held a small revolver of the ancient pattern and he fanned the point of it back and forth so that it covered impartially jernyngham lumley and simpson
stand where you are he commanded in a stuffy determined voice
plunkett whispered lumley astounded
yes answered the man with the weapon a deadly menace in his tones jeff plunkett on the road for lockett biggs hardware
this is a sample gun that i happened to find in my pocket
there are five lives in the cylinder by james forget that
sit down
but i say plunkett began jernyngham we were about to sit down exploded plunkett wrathfully
simpson did not wait to find a chair but wilted to the floor
jernyngham and lumley backed warily to the seats they had just vacated and dropped into them again
still watching the three plunkett moved to the table took a chair facing them and rested the elbow of his gunhand on the white linen
now listen he went on going to have a square meal and you are going to stay right where you are and watch me eat it
if one of you makes a move or speaks a word before i light a cigar therell be fireworks
i donot know a thing about electric guns and thunderbolts but buffalo bill himself hasnot anything on me when it comes to juggling a revolver
cautiously jefferson plunkett laid the weapon beside his plate and proceeded to relieve the very large famine that had afflicted him for twentyfour hours
lumley watched him wistfully even if a little fearfully while jernyngham looked on with humorous resignation startling jefferson plunkett made a clean sweep of everything on the table
double portions of ham and eggs fried potatoes and toast vanished from before him like magic
as the food disappeared his complacency grew
when the plates were empty he selected a cigar sniffed at it with the fastidiousness of a connoisseur smiled gratefully and lighted it then very coolly he appropriated the rest of the cigars and stowed them away in his pockets
take it from me gentlemen said he that i have just experienced the pleasantest part of this little dream
my mind is beginning to smooth itself out and have a few lucid intervals a cinch that this situation is too many for me and its another cinch that i was shanghaied and pushed idto it against my will
from now on i shall demand what i need and enforce my demands with this sample of locket goods
he picked up the revolver patted it affectionately and dropped it into his coatpocket
you may now he added indulge in any conversation that seems appropriate
simpson had slipped from the room while plunkett was lighting his cigar
he now very warily thrust his head in at the door
dust is flying in buffalo mr jernyngham he announced and they are asking for a hundreddollar sprinkle
also a request comes from the mohawk valley for a thousand dollars worth of soaking rain
very good nodded jernyngham
as soon as you hear from the treasury that buffalo and mohawk valley have remitted see that the sprinkleplug is switched in for a twentyminute precipitation at buffalo and that mohawk valley is lined with rainplugs for a twohours downpour
yes sir
simpson disappeared
plunkett grabbed the edge of the table stared at jernyngham and his lower jaw fell
his cigar dropped into a plate
after a moment he mumbled to himself picked up the cigar absently and resumed his smoking
just as beginning to feel tolerably comfortable said he something like this has to happen
mr plunkett spoke up lumley this gentleman is miles jernyngham of the weather bureau
plunkett acknowledged the introduction with a scowl and a nod
jernyngham lifted his voice and called for simpson
duplicate that breakfast order simp said he and see how quick you can do it
he turned to plunkett
lumley and he went on had just made up our minds that you had been recaptured so your appearance here was in the nature of a pleasant surprise
how did you get away from the guards miss kennedy attended to that answered plunkett
she dropped me through a grating in the diningroom and then led me up to the roof in a roundabout way
there we boarded the family flier
miss kennedy let me off on top of the weather bureau and told me to go down and look for friends
a derisive smile dug creases in the drummers face
and i donot think he finished that i gave you a pleasant surprise when i showed up here it was a surprise all right but the pleasure was mostly mine got to hand you a piece of my mind mr plunkett observed jernyngham and i might as well do it right now
i hope youll take it kindly but youve got to take it whether kindly or no
your conduct toward those who came with you to these times has been most reprehensible
you seem plunkett to be constantly on the lookout for opportunities to betray your companions into the hands of their enemies
now were a little band of castaways who by our native shrewdness and ability have succeeded in getting a strangle hold on our environment got to hang together understand
eternal vigilance is the price of our success
your brother tod is the boss dictator and on his account if for no other reason you ought to be with us rather than against us
if plunkett was impressed with these blunt remarks he failed to show it
he listened to jemyngham with a derisive smile jerry to this all right said he that everything seems and that nothing really is been doped and when i come to you can bet your bottom sou marquee that going to make things hot for the bunch that worked the hocus pocus
when i wake up i want to have the satisfaction of knowing that i plugged for my side even while i was under the influence of that funny powder
just at present little alice plunkett in wonderland and very very busy hunting a way back to junction where i got off
meanwhile going to be as obstreperous as i can
simpson came in and began clearing away the table
lumley watched him with interest and impatience
in fact he was so wrapped up in the prospect of that delayed breakfast that he could not feel properly aggrieved at the stand taken ly jefferson plunkett
jernyngham had it in mind to be very severethere was no doubt at all about thatbut before he could vent his indignation upon plunkett something else happened
a door opened and closed
footsteps were heard approaching hurriedly
there was another flurry of excitement in the chartroom and kinch flung himself ihto the office
ah lumley
kinch exclaimed
glad to see you jernyngham
excuse brevity but in the biggest kind of a rush
got an airship on the roof and just dropped in for a moment to have a word with lumley trying to corral all of our crowd at the office of the chief dictator
mortimer ripley and are there and lumley is to join them at once off to get dr kelpie
how did you know i was here inquired lumley
the news came by transmit from kennedy have you found dr kelpie heard from him
the information was brought by one of the guards who was bribed by the doctor
kelpie was recaptured but while he was free he managed to hide the timeball now hes back in the old quarters in amsterdam avenue with the guards doubled and theyre going to use the thinkograph on him and discover where he secreted the main part of the timemachine got to prevent that
dicks is marching a strong force of muglugs at the doublequick to the kelpie house and needed there to direct proceedings
a sound of quick movement drew all eyes toward the office door
jefferson plunkett was just making a hasty exit
come back here shouted kinch
be hanged to you flung back plunkett looking around and flourishing his revolver
try to stop me and shoot not get the want it myself
he slammed the door leaving those in the office staring at each other in apprehension and dismay
confound the fellow grunted jernyngham
not that this timeball counts for much so far as the dictators are concerned but it counts for more than you know cried the exasperated detective
i wish brought that electric gun
as it happens i havenot a weapon of any sort but not let that stand in the way
with that he flung open the door of the chartroom
the operators were huddled in one corner like a lot of frightened sheep
through the open door of the tuberoom jefferson plunkett could be seen puffing and floundering on the flight of iron stairs that led to the roof
followed by lumley and jernyngham kinch plunged on in fierce pursuit
by the time the three reached the foot of the stairs plunkett was out of the roofdoor and by the time the pursuers reached the roof the machine that had brought the detective was on the wing plunkett balanced amidships and covering the pilot with his revolver
as he slipped swiftly away into space the hardware drummer gave vent to a wheezy taunting laugh
if he gets that timeball cried the panicstricken lumley hell destroy it
he doesnot know he doesnot understand got to overhaul him exclaimed kinch another flyingmachine
i say there jernyngham got to have another machine
jernyngham was hauling a red flag to the top of a short staff signaling for a municipal flier said he
ah ha theres one now heading this way
the municipal machine which paid a license to the air ship department and was for hire rounded gracefully to a pause above the roof and then settled down into the stays
kinch and lumley ran up the steps and clambered aboard
follow that craft shouted kinch pointing south toward the other airship
the pilot started his helicopters and then when they were swinging well over the roof turned on the propellers doublecross this little game of declared the detective with grim determination
by what process of reasoning has he convinced himself that he can get that timeball anyhow why hes plain crazy there is no doubt of that plain troublesome jasper returned lumley and he seems to have a way of doing the wrong thing with a good deal of success
plunkett the avenger is surely an appropriate name for him
i have awful forebodings that he is on the point of doing something rash something that will result in a tremendous catastrophe
you forget frowned kinch that plunkett is matching wits with me
thereupon he broke off the conversation gave attention to the chase and urged the driver to crowd on more power
two things were evident to those in the municipal flier
one was that the driver was doing everything possible to get the best speed out of the machine and the other was that they were barely holding their own in the chase overloaded said the driver a man of the period cried kinch fiercely and on peril of your life tell me the truth are you for or against the dictators
is there any reason for you to keep this airship back the driver shivered under the deadly menace of the detectives voice and look no quarrel with the dictators he whimpered
if i had why should i hold this machine back
the man were chasing is one of your crowd
i tell you sir were overloaded
kinch appeared convinced of the drivers sincerity
never slow in making up his mind he had planned the next step before the pilot had done speaking
hover over that roof ahead there he ordered pointing
stop but donot land
come to a standstill two or three feet above the landingstage
very well sir
sorry lumley said kinch but the craft is overloaded and youll have to drop out on that roof and wait until i finish the chase and come back and pick you up
but be sure and wait
all of our crowd must be got together and kept together bag plunkett and well halt his troublesome career by keeping him bound and under lock and key
by lightening ship we shall be able to overhaul the craft ahead
lumley was disappointed but he had the utmost confidence in kinch and promptly fell in with his plans
the helicopters were holding the municipal machine a few feet above the landingstage of the strange rooftop
lumley climbed over the side lowered himself to arms length and dropped
he landed lightly easily and then watched while the airship resumed the chase
i hope nothing goes wrong he said to himself turning to the edge of the platform and descending a short flight of steps to the roof
if the timeball falls into the hands of our enemies theres no telling where our troubles will end
his worries on the score of dr kelpie and the timeball had caused him to forget for the time being that he had been deprived of the morning meal of which he stood very much in need
now that he had been eliminated from the chase and its attendant excitement his mind returned wistfully to the subject of his lost breakfast
a sort of pergola hard by the landing stage and offering a shelter of flowering vines invited him
he entered its cooling shadow and sat down on a cushioned bench
by a supreme effort of the will he sought to banish visions of ham and eggs fried potatoes toast and coffee
as a means to the end he steered his thoughts in other channels
it was clear that the members of the rescue society were going to have a hard time prying the dictators loose from their powers and prerogatives and carrying them back into the past
yet it must be done in some way
they had no moral right to tyrannize over the folks of the twentyfirst century
people of different ages are differently constituted
how would the people of the year have felt if some usurpers had come on from the year banished the telegraph for the post rider and retired incandescent bulbs in favor of tallowdips
no no
surely a man has no right to any other era than that in which he is born
the castaways perhaps not maliciously were perpetrating a great wrong and lumley was grieved to note that a sordid spirit had entered into their operations and that they were manipulating the weather the culinary operations and no doubt everything else for their own financial benefit
this reflections were cut short
what was that he heard
a groan
he started to his feet and listened intently
yes there was no mistake
here was something that demanded investigation
midway of the pergolas length was the builtup hood that sheltered the roofdoor
lumley observed that the door was ajar and he was not long in determining that the gruesome sounds he had heard were wafted through the opening
cautiously he advanced to the door pushed it wide and stepped through
descending the broad stairway a short distance he looked over the balustrade and an odd scene revealed itself to him
the room into which he had partly descended was the triclinium or diningroom of the household
it was a very rich apartment with walls frescoed by the hands of some master artist and with chairs and couches upholstered in the costliest fabrics
the grating through which the food vapors were wont to ascend was of yellow gold wrought out in an intricate and graceful design
on one side of this grating stood a tablea breakfasttable as it werebrought from some peasants hut and put down in those luxurious surroundings
it was covered with a paper cloth and the dishes were of tin evidently designed for other uses and pressed into service by sudden necessity
there was a bowlshaped dish half full of a dark liquid
at half a dozen places around the board were plates heaped with food a sort of food lumley could not remember ever having seen before
six chairs were pushed back from the table
those who had been eating were lying on couches or were writhing in chairs filled with a misery that found vent in heartwrenching groans
lumley grasped the situation in a moment
this was the result of decree these people of the period were trying to carry out the terms of the new law
for years they had sat at their golden grating conversing pleasantly and absorbing their nutrition
now they were trying to eat the solid nonvaporized nondeodorized food and the result could not be otherwise than painful heart went out to the sufferers even as his indignation waxed strong against the dictators
it was a brutal decree
famished as he was however the sight of that breakfast tempted him
not one of the six members of the household paid him the slightest attention and he descended quietly drew up one of the chairs and sat down at the table
he picked up a fragment of something tried to determine what it was by sight and then by taste
it was hard and soggy and burned
he dropped it
yes he was hungrier than he had ever been in his life but he couldnot go that
eat it commanded a hollow voice
it is called bread in the cookbook
you are from those distant times and we ask a demonstration
prove to us that the stuff is edible
lumley looked up
the man of the house evidently was standing before him
his absurd costume in nowise diminished the touching spectacle he presented
the pinched face and feverish eyes were mute evidences of starvation
my dear friend returned lumley with feeling i would put up with a good deal of personal inconvenience to eat this bread if it were possible
but it isnot
your cook has made a botch of the baking
try one of those chops begged the man there beside the bread
chops echoed lumley
these are not chops theyre clinkers burned to a cinder
no one could eat those things
have some of the coffee
lumley tried it and strangled
i canot he sputtered like to oblige you if i could but theres a limit to what i can stand even when ravenous
so came from the other bitterly
we are ordered by these usurpers to eat food that even they cannot endure and theyve always been eaters while we have become absorbers
our natures are delicately attuned to the beautiful and the progressive in life and the coarseness of the act of mastication revolts us even as the odors of the solid food is offensive
mark my words decree will prove the undoing of these usurpers
where did he come from queried another voice
lumley looked around
all the male members of the household four of themwere on their feet
the mother and daughter had lifted themselves on their couches and were staring at lumley with reproachful eyes
lumley explained that he had been set down on the roof by a friend and was to be picked up later
he was one of the recent arrivals
while on the roof he had heard groans and out of a desire to relieve a fellow creatures distress he had intruded into the triclinium
he hoped they would pardon him
he felt for them deeply and was sorry he was powerless to be of any help
if thy would excuse him he would go back to the roof again and wait for his friends airship
one of the sons sprang to the wall and pulled a switch
the roofdoor could be heard to close
i opened that door said the young man so that we could get the air
now it is closed and fastened
well done exclaimed the head of the house
send a transmit to the headquarters of the opposition one of you
we will turn this man over to them
then and for the first time lumley realized that his generous desire to aid the distressed had plunged him into trouble
to get to the roof was impossible
the elevator opening was in the wall behind him and he started up and retreated toward it
all the time he was executing his retreat toward the elevator he was pleading with his enraged foes for their kindly consideration
one of the sons was taking down an electric rifle from the wall
mother and daughter clasped in each others arms were on the verge of hysteria
but the father tortured into fury by decree was eager for hostilities
just as the young man turned with the electric rifle lumley fell backward into the elevator cage
his falling body touched the spring that released the car and he shot downward at the foot of the shaft he regained his feet and plunged through an open door
he was on the ground floor of the house and above him he could hear sounds of wildest commotiontransmits shouted to the opposition screams of women wild shouts of the men a patter of feet on broad staircases
lumley gained a massive street door only to find it locked
what was there to do
he fought with the door and as he struggled he called wildly for help
his calls he frantically reasoned were as useless as his attempts to open the door
yet he must do something and instinctively he continued to shout and wrench at the barrier with all his strength
suddenly there was a crash a ringing impact as of a ton of steel hurled against the door on its outer side
the stout wood shivered and all but yielded
again came the thunderous attack and this time the door was burst inward
lumley was flung backward to the floor
as he lay there he had a glimpse of a warrior muglug charging through the breach
the steel giant bent over lumley lifted him as easily as though he had been an infant flung him across one shoulder and made off with him
outside the house another muglug of the warrior class joined the first and shoulder to shoulder the two rattled and clanged their way down the street
the relief lumley might otherwise have felt was clouded with uncertainty
he was held to the muglugs shoulder by a viselike grip of the iron hands and every attempt he made to free himself was met with firm resistance
the two muglugs were at large
were they dependable or had they rebelled against the authority of jerry dicks and gone on a bit of a rampage
lumley could only wait and worry and hope for the best
five minutes after lumley had been rescued from the house where edict had caused so much distress he was borne into a great building that fairly roared with activity
on every hand steel was smiting steel and the din was terrific
muglugs were at work building other muglugs
the steel mechanics were divided into groups and each group had its own particular piecework
here were a dozen or so shaping fitting and riveting the metal heads just beyond these were the torsoworkers farther along were the toilers who hinged and jointed the wonderful arms and hands over on the right were those whose business it was to fashion the legs and feet and make perfect the clever joints at thigh knee and ankle and then last of all were the assembling frames where each part was brought together and the completed muglug stamped with a number and laid aside for test and final approval
lumley over the iron shoulder of the muglug who was carrying him surveyed the establishment with wonder and admiration
he had lost his fears for the arrival at the factory had convinced him that although the steel warriors were at large they were by no means proceeding at random
reassured as to his own personal safety he surveyed the plant with interest as he was carried through it
passing out of the huge workshop the two muglugs crossed a glassy plot and entered a small building
lumley was placed in a chair and the metal giants who had brought him ranged themselves side by side along the wall and lifted their hands to their foreheads
a towheaded usurper of perhaps twentyfive sat at a table in front of a number of blueprints and received the salute
at the opposite end of the table was a hatchetfaced thinshanked man who stared at lumley as though at a ghost
hello archibald grant exclaimed lumley
well what do you think of this muttered grant
where the deuce did those muglugs pick you up lumley
with the words grant came over and took lumley by the hand
they saved my life i think said lumley and explained his recent perils and the timely advent of the two iron warriors
good exclaimed grant striking his hands together in gratified approval
write it down haskins he added turning to his assistant at the desk nos and tested and found very well sir answered haskins and made an entry in a book
grant faced the two muglugs
proceed at once to the barracks he ordered and report to captain dicks
again the metal warriors saluted then wheeled and tramped away
as soon as the muglugs are finished explained grant we send them out into the town to see how they behave themselves under the subconscious rays
if they prove tractable and show the proper amount of initiative they are passed if on the other hand they are sullen slow in their movements and backward in obeying orders they are repaired and tried again
this is most remarkable exclaimed lumley
it should not beto you
it was your book which made such a factory as this possible
we are hustling out the muglugs as fast as we can
you see the new edict that retires vaporized and deodorized food is a good way from being popular
a storm is going to break before long and weve got to have the city properly policed
i should say the edict wasnot popular it looks to me like a very unwise proceeding
an elegant piece of graft though chuckled archibald grant already sold a million cookbooks and the gold for them is in the treasury
a year of this lumley and every one of the dictators will be a plutocrat
regret and sorrow stabbed lumley to the heart
graft graft
were these dictators thinking of nothing else
could they heap miseries upon the people for no other purpose than that of lining their treasury
lumley felt that he would soon have to take up the cudgels in defense of an oppressed people
for the present however there were other matters to claim his attention
have you heard anything about dr kelpie and the timeball he asked or about pursuit of jefferson plunkett
a couple of transmits came in just before you got here answered grant
dicks stormed the old kelpie house with a company of muglugs and rescued the doctor and then the doctor recovered his precious time ball
kinch also was successful
he overhauled jefferson plunkett and laid him by the heels then he sailed back to pfck you off the roof where you had been left and has been in a good deal of a funk ever since because he failed to find you
haskins grant turned to his assistant just go into the transmitroom will you and report that lumley is here at the muglug factory
haskins went into an adjoining chamber to send the transmit
all this good news left but one thing for lumley to desire
archibald said he could you furnish me with a meal
i have had nothing to eat for more than twentyfour hours and nearly famished
why sure lumley cried grant
haskins and i have already had our dinner but it wonot take us more than five minutes to get something through the tube for you
haskins send in a transmit for roast beef hashed brown potatoes bread butter apple pie and coffee
have the order rushed
haskins hurried away again
pink doolittle is the dictators chef lumley observed grant
you remember pink
he has a bloomer brigade to help him and puts up a pretty fair line of eats pulling down a good thing now and has a cooking school for the old vaporizers and deodorizersbusy every minute at a hundred dollars a minute that eh
all our earnings go into a common fund and when we get enough to retire were going to divide share and share alike
when you divide asked lumley wherell you retire to a blank look crossed face cross that bridge when we get to it he answered indefinitely
will you go back to hardly
the taste of unlimited power we have had has changed our whole outlook
these are pretty good times lumley for men with a little snap and ginger a pity your rescue society ever bothered with us
everything was going swimmingly until kelpie blew into this era hitched to his time machine
he was the hostage around which all the opposition rallied
if it hadnot been for him lumley wed have had no opposition
of course when the rest of you fellows came along the situation was still more complicated getting everything pretty well in hand though and there are jobs for several more dictatorswe can place all of you late arrivals in good positions
lumley shuddered
he would have expressed himself in no uncertain terms had not his dinner arrived at that moment
without loss of time he began appeasing his hunger
while he ate another pair of newly completed muglugs were carried into the office by the steelworkers in steel from the factory
these were laid grizzly mechanisms of inert metal upon the floor
in the head of each was an oilcup with a screw top
haskins opened the cups and filled them from a pipe in the wall
open the powerplugs haskins instructed grant and then send a transmit to head center for two more rays
haskins opened a little doofin the back of each muglugs head and tinkered for a moment with the powerplugs
after this he entered the transmitroom and sent in his call to head center
sitting in his deskchair archibald grant bent two keenly critical eyes on the prostrate steel giants
one of them lifted its hand as the subconscious ray allotted to it by head center took hold and the other began to quiver uncannily
get up ordered grant
with a ringing jump each muglug gained its feet imbued with power from the laboring human mind at head center
have you made the record haskins inquired grant
the assistant was writing in his book
no and no he replied
you two proceeded grant again addressing the muglugs will proceed to the hudson river and return by way of the pleasure gardens to this office
be gone an hourno longer
go
he waved his hand authoritatively
one of the muglugs whirled on its iron heel and started out
the other hesitated an ominous whirring sound issuing from its hollow interior
the sledge haskins called grant rising
haskins gripped an iron hammer that hung in a rack on the wall
at the same moment the defective steel giant rushed at grant like a modern monster upon puny frankenstein
grant leaped clear and haskins struck a clanging blow on the muglugs head with the hammer
a vital spot had been touched and the powerplug disarranged
the steel warrior clumped down on the floor in a disorganized mass and twitched and struggled feebly
haskins bounded into the transmitroom and could be heard signaling head center
mug defective
withdraw the ray
instantly no stiffened out and lay silent and still
it happens once in a while remarked grant grimly
call a couple of workers haskins and send to the repairshop
as two toilers from the workshop were carrying away the defective muglug a glittering airship hovered suddenly over the grassy sward between the office and the factory then dropped lightly and swiftly into the factory hangar
through the open door of the office lumley could see a determinedlooking man step out of the craft and come down the hangar steps
on either side of him marched a warrior muglug overlaid with gold and silver filigreework and armed with an electric rifle
now whats up remarked grant in a puzzled tone the chief dictator and he isnot due to inspect the plant for a week yet wrong thats a cinch
escorted by his glittering bodyguard tod plunkett the chief dictator hastened across the strip of lawn and entered the office
how are you tod cried lumley rising to greet the chief dictator
lumley old man returned plunkett effusively the sight of you is good for sore eyes
welcome again to the year things are vastly different now from what they were on your previous visit
the castaways have got a stranglehold on the times old chap and were out for reform with a big a job waiting for you and as soon as i got the transmit from the muglug factory giving news of your whereabouts i climbed into the meteor and flew over this way
say lumley youll never want to leave want to cast in your lot with ours and become one of the dictators
all the others who came with you have accepted places of power and we couldnot think of leaving you out that asked lumley thinking he had not heard aright
do you mean to say that kinch mortimer ripley and and dr kelpie have become dictators
exactly laughed tod plunkett
kinch is dictator of the secret service and his fees and perquisites should amount to several millions a year split up the department of foods raiments and beverages and mortimer goes in as dictator of raiments while rules the beverage bureau
i left mortimer preparing an edict which makes it a crime to wear bloomers of the period and declares that on and after thirty days from date clothing of the year must be secured from the tailors of the raiment department that for a rakeoff
ripley becomes dictator of dentistry and medicine and already his department is rushed to death on account of edict his returns brain was dizzy
but what is dr kelpie doing he interrupted hoarsely
he is dictator of microcosmology replied plunkett
it is his business to watch the play of the various elements in our little world and advise as to what must be done to keep in good health the goose that lays the golden egg
i hope you understand what i mean and the chief dictator gave a shrewd wink
the room was whirling around lumley and he gripped the back of a chair to steady himself
he had been counting upon his fellow members of the rescue society for aid in persuading the castaways to leave careers of tyranny and graft and go back comfortably to now these props had fallen away from him they had even gone to support that nefarious structure of oppression and tribute so cunningly raised by the usurpers
everson lumley stood alonealone against all this cruel greed which the twentieth century had unloaded upon the twentyfirst
ah dr kelpie dr kelpie who could have believed it of you
but stay
lumley had one thought like a forlorn hope
tod said he what office have you given your brother jefferson
i havenot seen jefferson as yet was the reply but i shall certainly have a good dictatorship for jeff
as for you lumley what more fitting than that you should be supervisor general of the subconscious rays
you can have a blue and gold office in the head center building and make sure that the rays are at all times efficient and properly directed no chance for graft but whats the odds all our pickings are thrown into a common fund and when weve had enough of the game well split even
what do you say lumley had not the slightest intention of allying himself with the freebooters
he was consecrated to the one purpose of rescuing all of them from their reprehensible careers and restoring them to spheres of respectable activity in their own times
but if he gained his end against such overwhelming odds he must proceed warily have to think about it tod he said
i canot give you an answer offhand
better come in with us lumley urged archibald grant see about that later was evasive response
i think tod he went on to the chief dictator that decree was a mistake
it is causing a tremendous amount of distress and the people will not put up with it
that decree i should judge from my limited observation is the last straw
tod plunkett frowned
the people will have to put up with it he declared
our muglug army will force them to carry out the terms of the edict
the will of the dictators is the law of the land
come along with me lumley go back to headquarters
the head dictator turned to grant
hustle the work here archibald said he
every capable muglug you turn out is another rivet in the fabric of our power
the stronger we are the farther we can go and the farther we go the more successful our information
by working night and day tod replied grant we can turn out on an average twentyfive mugs tested and every twentyfour hours
only about one in ten is defective
good work
keep it up be around for regular weekly inspection on saturday next
all ready lumley
the two products de luxe of the muglug factory especially constructed for the chief dictators bodyguard marched back to the gleaming airship as they had marched away from itflanking their august master
lumley what will happen to you if you stepped along behind succeed asked lumley
have you they boarded the meteor
a small ever thought of that plunkett compactly built muglugthe first lum why yes
when we make a cleanley had seen outside the warrior class up here lumley we shall go on to was the pilot
chicago and put through a similar re head center building ordered form there and from chicago well plunkett go to some other big city of the airship arose straight into the try
all the big towns are crying for air for five hundred feet and then dart reform and we dictators are ready to ed toward the north give them what they needfor a all the rooftops over which they sideration passed there was an ominous lack of tod plunkett rounded out his relife and not only there but everywhere marks with a greedy laugh which lumelse a still more ominous silence
vine ley did not like clad pergolas and flowery roofgardens by that time the meteor had carried were untenanted streets and even the them well up into the ancient bronx pleasure gardens were deserted and district and a building with a tall dome only here and there could an occasional and set by itself in a large square came man of the period be seen under their eyes like a dead city murmured the the head center buildawed lumley ing announced the chief dictator tut tut reproved plunkett
i looking lazily over the side donot like such gruesome terms
well well he muttered as his eyes only the calm that proceeds the real swept the scene below
his languid awakening of the people lumley
the air vanished
there are plenty of public of this era have vaporized itself people down there
by george all the into a weakkneed apology of what a citizens we missed farther south seem hearty progressive public ought to be to have flocked to head center plaza
these people invented the muglug and fighting cried lumley gradually retired from active service excitedly
i told you edict was and allowed muglugs to do everything the last straw
the citizens have rethat looked like work
lack of exer belled plunkett cise brought on dyspepsia dyspepsia let em rebel scowled the chief made it necessary to absorb food in dictator
i expected it would cost us stead of eating it vaporized nutrition a good deal of trouble to make real caused the people to run down phys men out of them but its a good work ically and when a nation is physically and were able to pay the price weak it becomes the prey of the strong
lumley filled with conflicting castaways saw our chance and laid tions stared down at the heaving hold of it
it is our laudable purpose masses of humanity below
as the to change every deplorable habit and meteor drew closer and closer to the bring the people of the period back to plaza the whole wild scene was brought a strong and efficient commonwealth into clearer and more thrilling detail
