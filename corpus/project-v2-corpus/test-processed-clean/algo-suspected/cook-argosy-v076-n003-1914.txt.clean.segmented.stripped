cook is there anything crooked about the way got hold of that property silas inquired bremerton quietly
not on your life and expression became exceedingly virtuous
i got the property at a bargain of course intending to turn it over to a syndicate make handsomely if i can let go for half a million but in order to do that the bullion has got to come as it did a year ago when i took over the proposition
you go down there lee and straighten things out
i wonot stand for anything offcolor deane
confound it thats why i want you
you can forget more in a minute about mining and milling than any expert knows in a year make it worth your while old man
you ought to get things coming our way inside of a month
after that keep up the good showing for six months and unload
what am i to get out of itexcept a chance to go to the hospital if lucky oh bosh
when you grab hold the gang will have the first real man to deal with that sent down there hunt their holes and you wonot have a mite of trouble
i know you or i wouldnot give you this chance
of course bremerton you ainot so darned old but i guess you sabe its getting pretty near time you took a start
eh
sure
now look here going to give you five hundred dollars a mdnth and allow you six months to make that mine a winner
how does that hit you that will amount to three thousand dollars observed bremerton provided i last for six months last all right
thunder
if youve got any white feathers concealed on your person then its all happened in the last five years
time was when they called you lee reckless and neither hell nor highwater threw a crimp into you
bremerton stirred uneasily
reckless he had been called but not justly
occasionally he had made the most of a desperate situation but not without carenever recklessly
if you want a reckless man deane he said you donot want me
come now insisted the other i guess i know who i want
this is a mans job and youre the man for it never far wide of my trail when i size up a bunch of circumstances and pick a chap to handle em
but if you donot want this chanceif you are not in need of money you know in need of money was the sharp response and you know only waiting to grab at something in the way of a chance
and that bremerton added a trifle grimly is why afraid of i hope for old friendships sake youre not trying to take advantage of my necessities
when you twang the sentimental string old partner you sure get me going crowd a stranger to the his lookout whether or not his eyeteeth are cutbut the needs of an old friend will always hit me close to the heart
lee wonot you see canot you see that trying to do something for you why you and me drank out of the same coffeecan years ago and once when i was nigh petered in the desert you wrung the last drop from the canteen and gave it to me
say do you imagine that all the money in the world could make me forget a few of those things
dash it not so walled in with dollars that i canot break through to help a chap i think more of than i would of a bloodbrother
bremerton listened thoughtfully
by turning a losing proposition into a winner he would help deane to half a million
balanced against that was the three thousand dollars he was to receive for the risk and the trouble
as though he had read his old friends thoughts deane leaned forward and dropped a confiding hand on his knee
but five hundred a month he went on isnot all willing to do for you a bonus in the work
make a showing help me to unload and theres a stake for you to tuck away in your jeans
maybe that wouldnot be a boost eh
bremerton it would start you on the way to easy street
tell me more about the mine deane
hanged if i do down there and you can see it for yourself
make a personal acquaintance with it give you a letter and a power of attorney you can handle the proposition just as though you owned it
what is the name of the man who is now in the hospital laceygordon lacey
i donot want to butt in and take his job away from him
deane fell back in his chair with a choppy laugh
from under a paperweight on his desk he took a yellow slip
read that said he a telegram i got from lacey the same day i wired you
oh i guess youre not taking anybodys job away from him
the telegram was brief and to the point accept resignation
i am done and probably done for
gordon lacey advance your first months pay bremerton said deane as the telegram was quietly returned to him
all right returned bremerton take the job
hooray
when will you start morning
now then tell me the name of the mine just where find it and give me any other particulars that will help me
for fifteen minutes the two were in close and earnest conversation but in the talk deane was strangely reticent about some things and full of detail regarding others
when bremerton left the office he had a check for five hundred dollars the confident good wishes of deane and a vague idea that he was taking rather a desperate leap in the dark
after all it was that tenthousanddollar stake that settled the question so far as lee bremerton was concerned
on his feet and in health gordon lacey must have been a fine figure of a man
with an eye keen for the architecture of bone and sinew framing that mystery of the spirit which makes a human being worth while bremerton read the late superintendent of the mariquita mine for what he was
days in hospital with strength ebbing and flowing about the misty borderland had pinched and whitened the face of the sick man
yet close though he was to physical wreck lacey was superb
it was nine in the evening when bremerton came to him
the young interne at the office desk was doubtful whether the patient could be seen
with lacey the dangerpoint was past and he was mending but up to that hour he had been denied to visitors
besides it was too late for visitors anyway
five minutes is all i ask with him pleaded bremerton
a nurse was called and sent to the ward
she returned with the announcement that lacey insisted on a brief interview with the man who was stepping into his shoes at the mariquita
so bremerton went up and the man in the white bed and his visitor exchanged looks and were straightway on friendly footing
you may have just five minutes mr lacey said the nurse glancing at the openface watch on her breast
five minutes will do and the patient peered at bremerton with a haggard smile
what can you tell me that will be of help lacey
bremerton asked
i donot want to tax your strength and i should not have come at this hour if another would have served
it was after seven when i reached phoenix and by sunrise tomorrow i shall be on my way into the hills
in a few words give me the gist of the situation
what did deane tell you
a good deal but nothing bearing on the real trouble
with two superintendents dealt with as you and the other have been in a mining district supposed to be peaceable and lawabiding theres a deep grievance somewhere
what was it deane left unsaid it is all a mystery to me bremerton
lacey picked thoughtfully at the bedclothes with his gaunt trembling fingers
you took the job on plain sayso that everything was square yes
so did i have had hard places before and got the whiphand of them but this work at the mariquita came near being my finish
when i first came i tried to fill out the gaps deaneleft in his story
he secured the mine from carruthers who at one time lived here
i tried to locate carruthers but he had decamped rather suddenly and no one knew where he could be found
after i had been on the job a few days mallory came and told me his side and used threats
i always look with suspicion upon a cause that is bolstered up with threats
i was short enough with mallory and then i was downed with a cowardly shot from the brush
who is mallory deane did not mention him
mallory bonded the mine from carruthers and failed to come across with the cash when the time limit expired
ah murmured bremerton
and what did mallory tell you lacey no use going into that
the old scoundrel will see you soon and tell you the same thing
what i want you to know what i want you to understand is this if ever you looked on the bright face of danger and felt the ground opening beneath you and your feet slipping toward bottomless deeps remember your peril when girl confronts you as she surely will
a woman a faint smile crossed the strong sunbrowned face of bremerton
how is girl mixed up in this sometimes i have thought she is the very soul of all the plot and counterplot which brought poor old griggsby to his end and came so near getting me
bewildered lines puckered around the sunken gleaming eyes
but i donot know i donot know
angel or shedemon i did not last long enough at the mariquita to discover
when she sfhiled i found my danger greatest
she sent for me told me she wanted to give me information of value and in riding to meet her i was snared like a helpless rabbit voice quivered with earnestness as he added as you value your life bremerton beware of mariquita mallory
bremerton would have laughed but out of respect for this strong spirit that had tried and failed he kept the laugh in his throat
a few women he had known and all of the best and he had yet to find one who could make a fool of him
his one love was the silent great outdoors where mountain and plain were ribbed with gold his for the finding
a woman could have no part in that
i can see you think i am babbling like an idiot went on lacey still gravely and earnestly but if i could tell you nothing else that one thing i want you to know beware of mariquita mallory
mallory himself you can take in your two hands and deal with him as an honest man deals with a scoundrel but a woman a beautiful that is different
the nurse came toward the bed her eyes on the watch
i am afraid you must stop now said she
only five minutes dr preston said mr lacey
just one thing more bremerton the sick man continued
i had to leave king the cyanid expert in charge
he is a capital cyanid expert but a poor hand with men
the quicker you reach the mine the better
he lifted and held out his hand
remember what i have told you about mariquita mallory and good luck
bremerton clasped the hand cordially and gratefully and left the ward
once clear of the hospital building he looked up at the round moon in the blue velvet sky hesitated a second then laid a course that carried him directly away from the hotel
he was not a stranger in that town
two years before he had outfitted there for a prospecting trip into the harqua halas
now he wanted to get away by himself and think
his word had been given to deane and he had taken money
for better or for worse he had plunged into this undertaking at the mariquita mine
the keynote of his character was loyalty and nothing could shake his determination to give to interests the best that was in him words however had plunged him into a train of reflection none too pleasant
his aimless feet brought him presently to the town ditch where the waters rippled musically and the moonlight silvered the cottonwoods and where from the soft recesses of the night came the notes of a whippoorwill
out of the dim past his memory constructed a similar scene
he had gone into camp ata waterhole there were cottonwoods like those whose white trunks now rose around him and then as now a whippoorwill sang in the distance
but on that night as he recalled he jhad been awakened by the cracking of a twig and had fought in the moonlight with a roving mexican who had tried to steal his burro and his grubpack
suddenly he paused straightened erect and listened
as by the waterhole so long ago here by the phoenix town ditch he heard a stealthy footfall behind him
instinctively his hands clenched and he braced himself for an encounter
another moment and the mood passed
with a low laugh he leaned against the trunk of a tree
well friend he called are you following me or does it just happen that you are on my trail
the dark figure which his eyes had glimpsed came out of the shadow and into a splotch of moonlight
a large man in a broadbrimmed hat stood out against the dusky background clear as a silver print
the head was shaggy with hair and beard and in the dark of the hatbrim two eyes glowed like points of flame
my names mallory said a husky voice and been following you ever since you struck town
mr bremerton ainot it so this was mallory appearing as lacey had foretold only somewhat before the time bremerton had expected him
yes this is bremerton like to inquire mallory why you have favored me with your attention get to that was the answer as the speaker drew closer just been to the hospital
picked out a comfortable place there against the time youre ready for it did griggsby pick out a place if he did what good did it do him
he never lived to get to the hospital did he i donot know about griggsby and i donot know who put lacey where he is
all i do know is that deane will never get any good out of the mariquita mine and those who try to help him will never get no good out of it either
deane is a cutthroat a pirate a blackhearted swine who you are talking of a friend of mine mallory bremerton interrupted sharply
friend a husky jeering laugh came with the word
a fine riend of yours when he sends you into such a trap as that at the mariquita wonderin why so interested in your movements bremerton
i got a reason no sooner signed on with deane than i knew of it
a telegram from denver was relayed to me in the hills
i came to town and have been waitin for you
since you got here i have trailed around after you looking for a chance to give you a bit of advice
just out of kindness of heart thats all
recalling remarks about mallory bremerton observed in a tone of chilling finality when i want your advice mallory ask for it
no you wonot the other returned dropped into the little pit deane has dug for you and you donot even sabe that hes ntuy malo
i allow you think the villain in these here tragedies at the mariquita but youre wrong
mallory stepped still closer
he put out a hand as though to lay it on arm but bremerton stepped back
now that mallory was within arms reach of him bremerton could see that his beard and hair were iron gray and that his face was oldold in ways of the world perhaps as well as in years
you act as if i was a rattler went on mallory and soundin a warning before i strike
man youre way wide of your trail
the warning giving you is for your own good
there are others who will strike if you do not listen young lee bremerton
five hundred dollars a month for six months and ten thousand as a bonus if you make goodwhat are they
just a bait to lure you into the same fate that overtook griggsbyl leave the mariquita mine alone
you can make nothing of it and in the end it will wring you dry and toss your bones on the scrapheap
clear out ordered bremerton have none of the threats you call advice and warning
the old man drew a deep sigh and without a word turned away
he passed like a specter through the pool of moonlight and melted into the shadows beyond
scarcely had he vanished when footfalls reached ears
swift and catlike they came from either side and from behind
bremerton was a man who always stood his ground
he squared himself now to meet what was to come
vague shadowy shapes were closing in gliding toward him swiftly from three different directions
if that was there was no challenge no parley
out from among the whitetrunked cottonwoods hurried fantom shapes and in grim silence fell upon bremerton
one moment he saw them coming and the next moment he was among them and fighting
he had only his bare hands
his assailants were armed with clubs and one of them had a quirt for its thongs fell stingingly over face and throat
the hot blood leaped in the prospectors veins
these cowards four or five or half a dozen of them were upon him in a crowd with their whips and their bludgeons
they were like a pack of wolves
outraging every principle of fair play they would smother him under a weight of numbers and give him no chance for himself
circumstances like these were more than enough to arouse all the savage resentment rn nature
in a flash he became the lee reckless of those old days with cornered wildcata cave man with his back to the walla fury with all the seething elemental passions uppermost
his foes were many and he must take them one by one
while he charged a single vague shape he was forced to run a gantlet of blows that staggered and dazed him
yet one man crumpled under the weight of his fist and as the ruffian groaned and pitched forward the prospector whirled and charged again
feet crunched and slipped in the gravelly soil sharp labored breathing rent the air in staccatolike notes and over all rose the sodden thumps of the clubs
again and again the prospector wrenched himself clear of the press
perhaps not one blow in half a dozen reached him for the gloom and the excitement sent many of them wild but the bludgeons that found their mark had a cruelly crushing strength behind them
while he drove before him another of his foes the rest hung upon his back and belabored him viciously
nothing kept him from his quarry
at the edge of the town canal the retreating enemy was forced to make a stand
bremerton glimpsed the mans swarthy scowling face in the moonlight
the fellow had raised a club for a telling blow
before the club could fall bremerton grasped it and wrenched it away
almost simultaneously his hard fist darted at the shadowy face and the man went over the brink of the canal and into the water with a splash
bremerton whirled smashing right and left with the club
another man was struck and beaten to his knees
the prospector trampled him roughly to get at his companions
a stick aimed at head glanced and struck his right arm
the arm fell limp and useless as though a bone had been snapped
a sickening pain convulsed the prospectors whole body but he rallied magnificently
he had lost his weapon and fqr offense and defense he had now only his left hand
slowly his physical powers were failing but his resolution grew as his strength diminished
he sprang at another of his assailants and just at the moment a pair of arms encircled his knees and he was thrown from his feet
then the pack closed in
on his head his shoulders his back rained the blows
his left arm protected his face but finally that arm too dropped away
with a choking gasp he measured his length on the ground lying there helplessly while he fought to hold his fading senses
the attack ceased
some one knelt beside him and whispered hoarsely in his ear this is all for now but go out to the mariquita mine and worse will follow
remember what the voice died out in ears
a pall suddenly encompassed his faculties and he neither heard nor realized anything more
he drifted back to reason presently and found himself alone
his head throbbed and his whole body rebelled when he attempted to move
he ground his teeth to stifle a groan
by degrees his brain cleared
mallory had threatened and men had been handily by to make clear to him that the threats were to be taken seriously had their chance at me muttered bremerton hoarsely and some day get my chance at them
he tried to lift himself to his knees but the white stems of the cottonwoods danced mistily around him and again he flattened out on the earth
water would revive him
if he could get to the crawled in the direction of the ditch digging into the ground with his fingers and pulling and pushing himself on
pains like daggers stabbed him in a dozen places
for all that he found he could use his arms and legs so it could not be that any bones were broken
he was coming out of that onesided battle much better than he had any reason to hope
although bruised and sore he was not seriously injured
for several minutes he lay at the edge of the canal scooping up the water and splashing it over his face
little by little his strength returned
the night wind whispered soothingly among the cottonwood leaves and the song of the whippoorwill echoed from the peaceful shadows
but what was this
the bird out yonderwhat was it singing
with a painful effort he lifted his bruised and battered body on one elbow and stared in the direction of the misty alfalfafields trickle from a fleshwound on his forehead overflowed and blinded his eyes
removing a handkerchief from his pocket he held it in the water and then passed it over his feverish face a crazy fool he mumbled
what the whippoorwill said to the stars had long ago been established
only his disordered fancy could make anything else out of it
his wits surely had gone far afield to imagine the burden of those flutelike notes
what under heaven had possessed him sick and suffering as he was to think of mariquita in connection with that scrap of melody
mariquita
angel or did not know which
why in that hour was she in his thoughts
lacey had been riding to meet the girl when he was shot from the brush
very possibly there by the town canal she had inspired that clubbing of the man who was to take place
bremerton sopping the blood from his face with the wet handkerchief cursed the name and her who bore it
at last he arose to a sitting posture wrung the linen dry and bound up his temples with it
he was a rifleshot from the main street of the town and he must get back to his hotel
a glow of electric lights hung in the sky well beyond the shadows of the cottonwoods
his eyes measured the distance between the canal and the farflung maze of the arcs and the incandescents
for a man with two good legs under him the way was not far but for bremerton in his present condition it was very far indeed and perhaps impossible
he tried to lift himself erect but only half succeeded when he sank to the earth again
as yet he had not mastered his aching nerves and muscles
he could crawl at least if he could not walk
on hands and knees swaying uncertainly as he went he made his slow passage toward the edge of the cottonwoods
on the scene of his struggle with bravos his groping fingers encountered something which puzzled him
the object was round about the size of his fist and tied up in a cloth
at first he thought it a slungshot dropped by one of the miscreants who had worked their will with him
he was curious enough however to grope in his pockets for a match and then by its light to make a more thorough examination
yes at a time when another would have thought only of his physical torments bremerton could give time and strength to trifles
in prospecting for gold a thousand trifles carefully weighed might lead to a strike
years of prospecting had taught him the value of the little things and he did not neglect them
the cloth enclosing the round object proved to be a red cotton handkerchief carefully tied
he removed the cord the folds of the handkerchief fell away and a small globe of frosted silver lay revealed
an exclamation of wonder escaped lips
the silver ball was a sphere of amalgamgold coated with quicksilver just as taken from the plates of a mill and squeezed in a chamois skin
the squeezing had driven off some of the quick and given the mass its spherical form
of course the ball had been dropped by one of assailants
it proved that at least one of the rascals was a mill man or indirectly had something to do with a stampmill
this in itself was no identification as there were hundreds of such men in that part of the country
with the aid of another match bremerton examined the ball more closely
its upper surface was a curious formation of small ridges where the folds of the chamois had been gathered together and strong pressure applied with the hands
the lower half of the sphere was smooth save for an indentation that resembled the letter or was it an bremerton scowled
by some chance the mallorys father and daughter were so vividly in his mind that he instinctively looked for them everywhere
he growled over his folly replaced the ball in the handkerchief and stowed it away in a coat pocket
then he would have crawled on again had a sound not reached his ears and suggested caution
it was a sound of horses hoofs approaching slowly from the direction of the road
he could see the rider indistinctly coming through the heavy shadows cast by the trees
the horse moved to right and left in a zigzag course as though its rider were seeking something
bremerton wondered grimly whether he or the ball of amalgam was the object of the strangers quest
suddenly while he knelt there watching and waiting the approaching rider passed a spot upon which the moonbeams had full play
a gasp of amazement came from bremerton
the silvery light touched as with a caress the bare head of a woman
the hair shining and luxuriant was brushed smoothly back from the temples
in its strands the stem of a fullblown rose was entangled
the womans face was dim yet bremerton could see enough of it to know that it must have been wondrously fair
her form was erect and graceful and she was mounted in a mans saddle and rode as a man would ride
if you happen to be looking for me called bremerton grimly this way
the girl started peered in the direction from which the voice had come and quickened the pace of her horse
if you happen to be lee bremerton said she in a voice at once soft and musical then i am looking for you
he laughed huskily and jeeringly am very much alive he returned which is probably a great disappointment to mariquita mallory
the illnatured remark seemed to make no impression upon her
drawing her horse to a stop she dismounted calmly and stepped in front of bremerton
bremerton knew this girl was mariquita mallory
in his mind that conviction was as fixed as fate
first had come her father then her fathers men and now why not the girl herself
it seemed peculiarly fitting
not too close he ordered sharply
about where you arewill be near enough
fear was a mental poison which his strong soul had never known
some day when his brain was sick and he was physically broken he might know it but it would not be a woman who caused his heart to fail and his courage to wane
he commanded the girl to keep her distance because his whole nature was in hot revolt against her and her father and their schemes of violence
she gave his words no attention
serenely she glided to a spot from which she could have reached forth and touched him had she wished to do so
are you badly hurt mr bremerton she asked softly
no he answered shortly
it was cowardly to set a pack of hoodlums upon an unarmed man like that
i agree with you and as soon as i heard of it i came here
i want to help you to be your friend
may i have the chance
there was a wistfulness in her voice which did not escape him warning still rang in his ears however and he thought she was playing a part for purposes of her own
clear out he called roughly and leave me to myself all i ask of you
are you able to get back to your hotel she persisted
yes
he staggered to his feet
swaying drunkenly he was compelled to lay hold of a tree and support himself
madre mia the girl breathed how you must have been beaten
oh the fiends the cowards
she clasped her hands convulsively
and you thinkyou think that i had a hand in this contemptible nights work
he could not see her face there in the shadow but her voice went through the phases of sympathy and indignation and reproach
her acting was superb no guesswork said he sternly all a matter of fact a woman and i donot want to forget that in my talking with you
will you go
in a little while
i canot leave you like this
are you still intending to go out to the mariquita mine mr bremerton if you and your father have any idea you can scare me you will have to guess again going to the mine and get the goods on those who settled for griggsby and sent lacey to the hospital
tell your father that
i suppose i have any more sand than griggsby or lacey but tougher and going to last long enough to do the work that brings me here
a breath like a sigh came from the dark slender figure confronting bremerton
if you were not suffering said the girl if i did not know you were in physical pain i could tell you things which would make a change in your plans
i think you are a man of courage and the brave are usually just
i can imagine that what you have heard about my father and me has not caused you to feel very friendly toward us but donot be hasty
reserve judgment mr bremerton
a man who will trap another with a crowd of hoodlums as your father trapped me wants anything but justice
if he had his deserts he would probably be in the phoenix jail this minute and for all i know youd be there with him
you canot handle me as you did lacey or stop
the word flashed at him daggerlike
a temper the girl had carefully concealed up to that moment darted keen and sharp to the surface of her nature
for an instant bremerton was surprised and then he reflected that his rough speaking had torn away the mask and given him a glimpse of the real mariquita mallory
there was a throb of sorrow and undernote of grief shuddering through that blaze of anger but it passed him say something the girl went on in a stifled voice that you may one day be sorry for
i am here to help youlet me repeat that again
and let me repeat that i want none of your help
while i am at the mariquita the less i see of your father and you the better
after a brief space mariquita stepped to her horse and laid a hand on the bit
then she led the animal close to bremerton
get into the saddle she said crisply and ride to your hotel
leave the horse at the post in front and i will either come after him myself or send for him
her persistence irritated bremerton
you and your father are enemies of and so of mine he answered
i donot intend to begin my work by placing myself under even a slight obligation to you
take your horse and go away
i can shift for myself
she stepped back into the moonlight
her right hand lifted to the level of her eyes and a small revolver glimmered in her fingers
mount she ordered
this will settle the obligation business
if necessary i can force you to be sensible
mount and ride to your hotel and leave the horse as i told you
the gleam in her eyes matched the silvery sheen of the leveled weapon
her erect graceful figure the moonbeams shimmering on her hair and on the rose in its thick coils the beautiful face framed strongly in lights and shadows and over all her dominant and resolute bearing conspired to form a picture that stirred bremerton strangely
what a woman
one moment soft and gentle and pleading and the next moment fiery with determination and enforcing her commands at the muzzle of a revolver
the novelty the inconsistency of it all broke over him presently and he laughed
nevertheless he lifted a foot to the stirrup and climbed weakly into the saddle
he rode away leaving mariquita there in the moonlight
the last he saw of her the revolver and the hand that held it swung at her side and he fancied a smile wreathed her shadowy lips
it was midnight when bremerton dismounted in front of his hotel and walked unsteadily into the office
the night clerk gasped and stared at him wonderingly
his clothing was torn and earthstained and in disorder and his face was puffed and bruised and a reddened bandage was swathed about his forehead
the key to seventeen said bremerton bracing himself at the counter
great guns murmured the clerk
what has happened to you he had not been on duty when bremerton arrived and he hastily ran his eye down the page of the open register
i should think mr bremerton that you need a doctor
let me help you upstairs and then i will call a i can get upstairs alone cut in bremerton and donot bother about a doctor not in such bad shape as you seem to think
he took his key and started for the stairs
in about five minutes he added halting a moment send up a boy with a pitcher of icewater and some telegraphblanks
if you have been beaten up and robbed by thugs we ought to get the police busy
i havenot been robbed
just had a little hard luck thats all and i donot want the matter to go any further a case of least said soonest mended
understand certainly mr bremerton but bremerton waited for no more but slowly ascended the stairs to his room
he was weak and dizzy and after he had snapped on the electric light he fell sprawling on the bed
his aches and pains seemed to have been lost in a paralyzing nausea that filled his body
had he not been in the pink of physical condition hardy and robust from years of wandering through the untracked wilderness that beating must surely have been the death of him
breathing hard and with every muscle relaxed he lay on his back starirtg up at the ceiling
the mallorys had taken this method to frighten him away from the mariquita mine
they little knew the temper of the man they were dealing with
so far from intimidating him his resolution to help deane was merely strengthened
for years he had breasted the blows of circumstance
the more difficulties he encountered and conquered the greater his pride in any success he might achieve
fear and discouragement were for weaklings
and lee bremerton had never been a weakling
strangely enough the events of the night brought him a certain measure of relief and satisfaction
he had vaguely imagined from reticence in certain matters that some sharp practise lay back of the murderous enmity for men at the mine
that deane was none too scrupulous in forwarding his owh interests bremerton understood thoroughly
those who resort to cudgels and a night attack are never the ones with a just cause behind them
so by implication right to the mariquita property had been proved
this was what afforded the prospector his relief and satisfaction daughter was a good deal of a puzzle
certainly she was a splendid actress
at first she had assumed a friendly attitude hoping no doubt to deceive him to win his confidence and then to work upon his sympathies
but he had angered her by a few words that emphasized his knowledge of her true character arid she had burst into sudden flame like a powder magazine touched by a lighted match
sick as he was he rather prided himself on having forced aside the mask for a glimpse of the real mariquita mallory
yet in spite of his positive convictions there was something about the girl that defied a complete understanding of her
when i get over the effects of this clubbing he assured himself be able to think to better purpose
lacey was undecided in his estimate of the girl but told me to beware of her
he appears to be a clearheaded sort of fellow and i canot see why he was undecided
my little experience with mariquita mallory has left me with no doubt at all
still if i knew more a sensation hard to define overshadowed his conclusions
it was a sensation that baffled analysis
the mine was called the mariquita
the name could scarcely be a coincidence
of course the girl had inspired it
yet how and why if this person carruthers had originally located the property had carruthers known mariquita mallory
had he been so greatly impressed with her that he had given her name to his mine
these were trifling thoughts
as questions they merely harassed a mind which was unequal to any sort of struggle with them
a light quick step sounded in the hall accompanied by a musical tinkling of ice in a pitcher
a knock fell on the door and a boy entered the room with water telegraphblanks and writing materials
wait said bremerton
his brain whirled as he rose from the bed and seated himself at a small table
a drink of icewater refreshed him somewhat and he slowly wrote out the following message silas deane
denver
arrived phoenix this evening
work promises to be interesting
off for mine tomorrow
bremerton
he gave telegram arid money to the boy and sent him away
then as well as he was able he looked after his injuries and went to bed
a not always in real life do names fit the characters of those who bear them
as a case in point mortimer king cyanid expert at the mariquita mine was anything but regal anything but manful and twohanded in his sway over men and affairs
from a to he knew his cyanid work
there were keenness and penetration in his mild washedout blue eyes
from a glass of solution held up to the light he could almost determine by sight alone how many pounds of potassium cyanid should be thrown into the big vat to bring its contents up to standard
and there were those who said that by merely glancing at a handful of tailings he would figure you their worth in ton lots to a cent
but he was not even primerwise in a knowledge of human nature and he was a child in tact and diplomacy and a mere babe in arms when it came to meeting a hard situation with judgment and energy
lacey had known this when leaving king in charge
racked with pain and half delirious when borne away from the mariquita he had been in no condition to pick and choose a successor pro tern
even so he had yet had no second choice whatever his other shortcomings king was the only man at the mine who in the absence of the superintendent would be loyal to deane
two weeks lacey had been gone
they were weeks of mental distress for king who realized fully his own incompetence
if affairs had gone badly under lacey they nearly went to smash under king
about all the cyathid expert hoped for was to hold the mine organization together until the new man arrived to fill the place vacated by lacey
troubles began almost before lacey had been carried over the hill in the mine buckboard
the miners struck for higher pay although they were re ceiving better wages than were being paid at any other mine in that district
they struck apparently just to be contrary and worry mortimer king
with no mining going on the orehaulers had to be laid off with no drills to point the blacksmith and his helper were out of a job and with nothing to mill the millmen were forced into idleness
then the spirit of unrest laid hold of the cyanid workers and one by one they drifted away to loaf with the others
king was at his wits end and telegraphed wildly to deane going to pot the new man
and to this deane answered in characteristic vein keep your shirt on
new man on the job thursday morning
king began counting the days until thursday
on wednesday some unknown person smuggled a supply of red liquor into camp
steve bryden otherwise known as big steve began imbibing and slowly and systematically working himself up to concert pitch
he made an art of getting in tune as he called it
in twentyfour thirtysix or fortyeight hours according to his own prearranged schedule he would strike high then as king very well knew the super pro tem would have difficulty keeping his scalp on let alone his shirt
the cyanid expert would have sent to phoenix for the sheriff
there was nobody to send however and he dared not leave the mine himself
wednesday night big steve got a sledgehammer from the deserted blacksmithshop and joyously broke all the windows in the bunkhouse
just wanted to tease somebody he explained when king ventured a feeble remonstrance
the little devils in his drinkmaddened brain were growing
the mexicans fled to their jacals and herded their wives and children behind closed doors
the americans and halfbloods moved their blankets to a dry wash and posted a guard
wun sing the cook barricaded himself in the chuck shanty
from the laboratory king torn with conflicting emotions watched the trail from and hoped against hope
it was known that big steve had a dark past
but he had not acquired it in his sober moments
not much of good could be said of him when his brain was clear although in that state he was never openly lawless
in drink all his evil flew brazenly uppermost and his black folly knew no bounds
barring king the americans at the mariquita mine were a poor lot
laborers of the better class would not work there for the taking off of griggsby had given the property a hard name presence was a necessity
he was the accredited agent of a denver company that owned cyaniding rights and king saw to it that royalties were paid from every cleanup
big steve was not the worst of the americans when sober but he was far and away the worst of them when tuned
and from the others king could expect no aid
he was thrown wholly upon his own resources and these as already observed were weak and scattering
thursday morning big steve carried his pleasantries a little further
breaking down the door of the chuck shanty he drove forth the luckless wun sing and chased him out of camp
so along with the mine the mill the blacksmithshop and the cyanid plant the chuck shanty went out of business
king lived on sardines and crackers
how the other americans lived he did not know nor care
he had himself to worry about
his naked eye could not reach far enough
from the laboratory he was now scanning the trail with binoculars
that was thursday morning and why did not the new superintedent come
the sun passed the meridian and slowly descended upon a stricken camp despair grew as the day faded and no one arrived to take over his responsibilities
reason told him to flee under cover of that thursday night and while there was yet time
duty warned him to remain in spite of big steve and what big steve might do
yes he would stay he must stay
but he wished he had something to shoot with
the cyanid expert did not close his eyes between sunset and dawn
at eight in the morning he crept cautiously toward the end of the pipeline to renew his water supply
then big steve rushing from the chuckshanty and brandishing a blade which wun sing used for peeling potatoes drove the unhappy expert pellmell in the direction of the headquarters adobe
the officedoor was locked
king himself had secured it and at that moment the key was in the laboratory
white and shaking the expert turned and flattened out against the adobe wall
yah taunted big steve pausing a dozen feet away and leering with his bloodshot eyes you good for say
his voice was thick but he kept his feet steadily
his whole bearing was one of terrible menace
clear out you big brute answered king shaking the tin waterbucket you dare come nearer me with that knife
you ought to be ashamed of yourself
by george report you for this
it was a gallant effort to hold his own
what it cost the little cyanid worker a man of more spartan fiber could never know got no more sand than a chipmunk howled big steve even an apology for a real man plumb annoyed at having you around
king you little wart heres where you cash in
a line of heads rimmed the edge of the distant dry wash
a swarthy ragged palpitating group watched proceedings from the mexican quarter
all knew that big steve had reached the climax of deviltry that the grand finale was about to be staged and that immediately following it his reign of terror would be overwhelmed by a period of sleep and helplessness
but would he kill the little man with the waterbucket
not one of those who looked on from a distance would have given a copper cent for chances
king probably would not have given much more himself
slowly deliberately big steve advanced upon his intended victim
the millmans face was puffy and splotched with red a crazy glare filled his eyes and as he moved onward he tucked up his right sleeve with his hairy left hand
you king there
run
one of those at the edge of the dry wash offered the advice
it was useless however nerves had buckled under the strain and he was pinned to the adobe wall by the growing horror of his dilemma
he was like a rabbit fascinated by the diamond eyes of a rattlesnake
approaching hoofs sounded suddenly from near at hand
neither king nor big steve seemed to hear them
the trail into camp wound around the end of the office building and a horse carrying a double burden presently emerged into view
an erect figure in corduroys and laced kneeboots face decorated with several small squares of courtplaster occupied the saddle at the cantle astride the double war bags sat the chinaman wun sing
one glance at the state of affairs by the headquarters adobe was enough for the chinaman
with a gurgling cry of fear he tumbled from the horse and fled to a safer distance
at the dry wash and in the mexican quarter a fresh interest was injected into the situation
here was a stranger possibly the new man who was taking place
he had no more than struck camp before being called upon to dispute with big steve the right to rule
what would he do
how would he conduct himself intensely stirred by the progress of events the americans came out of the dry wash and advanced a few rods
the mexicans also took places for a nearer view
for king the uncanny spell was broken
a cry of relief broke from his lips and he flung up his arms and crumpled weakly down on the office doorstep
big steve had withdrawn his attention from the cyanid expert and fastened jt upon the newcomer the new boss hey the niillman flung savagely at the rider
i am was the crisp response
not sos you can notice it whooped big steve been the boss here for three hull days and the job pleases me a heap
i donot share it with nobody
sabe that tother way and say adios before i turn loose at you
clear out said bremerton calmly drunk
not so drunk i canot fight
big steve waved the knife about his head
none of the bosses last at the mariquita
come over here if you got the sand come over here and git scalped
bremerton flung the reins over his horses head swung down from the saddle and started toward big steve
he neither hurried nor lagged
he merely strolled in big direction unarmed apparently and with his compelling gray eyes fixed unswervingly upon the face of the troublemaker
more than one of the spectators caught his breath and felt a chill of grisly foreboding
king tried to shout a word of advice and warning but his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth
big steve had planted himself firmly on his stocky legs and his right hand with the short ugly blade was poised for a blow
he stood like a man of stone while bremerton drew close
then a most astounding thing happened
quick as chainlightning bremerton gripped the upraised wrist and wrenched it downward and sidewise
the knife fell from big fingers and over the captured right arm master and man looked into each others face bind
big steve was accustomed to having his own way when his brain was befogged with liquor
no doubt the surprise of finding some one who was not afraid of him had taken him aback for the moment and given bremerton the advantage
with a bellow of rage be wrenched his arm free
bremerton kicked the knife toward king and stepped back warily kill you for that fumed big steve running his words together in a way that made them almost unintelligible
he was losing his steadiness and he staggered as he rushed at bremerton
the latter moved to one side thrust out a foot and the millman stumbled over it and lurched headforemost to the ground
he struck heavily and his forehead came in contact with a stone which was half embedded in the gravelly soil
a wheezy gasp escaped him a tremor ran through his huge body and he flung his arms wide and lay still
bremerton stared at him a moment in silent contempt
turning to king he asked is this the fellow who chased the chinaman out of camp
yes was the answer
big steve has been on a tear ever since wednesday
jove
that was a nervy thing you did
i wouldnot have been in your shoes for all the gold in arizona
who is he amalgamator in the millone of the best amalgamators in the business
he has his peculiarities though no room here for a man of his stripe
when he sleeps off that jag send him to me for his time
here you
bremerton beckoned to the men near the dry wash
i need some of you
they came forward with alacrity
what they had just seen had inspired a certain amount of respect for the new superintendent
carry this man away ordered bremerton
one of you put out my horse and bring the riding gear to the affice
one minute first
he whirled and ran the man over with a sharp appraising eye
what were you doing over there while that big ruffian was trying to massacre the little fellow the men shifted about uneasily
one of them finally spoke pilgrim when big in likker weall makes it a pint to hide out and watch keerful
meddlin with steve at them times is uncommon risky
mean to say you were all scared
wall now i donot reckon say skeered a mighty sight of diffence between being skeered and exercisin plain caution with a madman like steve when hes on the rampage
i allow you plumb hypnotized him been drinking too said bremerton quick to read the signs
hereafter when any of you want to get drunk youll do it in phoenix and not at the mariquita mine taking place understand
while in charge therell be no whisky in camp
remove that man and look after my horse
on the jump
bremerton pulled the saddle bags from behind the cantle and passed to the officedoor
king anticipating a demand for the office key had hurried to get it from the laboratory
when things began to go wrong here mr bremerton he explained i thought better lock up the office
you are mortimer king yes
the new superintendent stepped through the doorway into the square little room where the clerical work was carried on
king had paused to watch three of the men pick up big steve
two or three articles dropped from the amalgamators coat while he was being lifted
one was a bag of tobacco another a flask and still another ivas a square of dingy chamois skin
better gather up that stuff and take it along said king
hold on a minute interposed bremerton
he hurried out of the office and set his heek on the flask
for a moment his eyes rested on the chamois skin
an exclamation escaped him and he stooped and picked it up
he stuffed the chamois skin into his pocket as he went back into the office
now mr king said he justr what is the situation here
i found the chinaman camping out at a waterhole between here and town
he told me a little but only enough to make me anxious for more
bremerton sat down in front of the rolltop desk took pipe and tobacco from his pockets and prepared for a smoke
king drew up a chair sank into it and composed his agitated nerves
there was something about the new superintendent that inspired confidence
courage and determination are qualities which never fail to command the wholesome respect of enemies and the trust of friends
as the weaker vessel king deferred humbly to bremerton glad that deane had secured such a man to captain the dubious fortunes of the mine
a strong face shone lividly in the light of the match bremerton trailed over the pipebowl
bruised discolored and with here and there a black patch along with its grimness the face contrived to reflect an amiable as well as a dauntless spirit
little mortimer king warmed to the man and did not hesitate to confess his own failings
i was a pretty poor stick for lacey to leave in charge bremerton said he
i have no sense or sand in dealing with the neardesperadoes on this mines payroll
the men knew it and lacey was hardly carried over the hill before they began to take advantage bear down on yourself king returned bremerton
sometimes the difficulties that are one mans meat are another mans poison
a few in this world are equipped for one thing and a few for some other thing
the master potter fashions the clay from designs and patterns of his own
it is not our business to go behind the returns and try to puzzle out the reason
go on and tell me about the situation here
king was surprised to find bremerton as forceful in thought as well as in action
he did not know of the lonely years bremerton had spent in the wilds communing with himself as he trod the unblazed trails or guessing at the heart of things as he lay on a blanket looking up at the stars
the cyanid expert began at the beginning
he told of the strike among the miners and how the failure of the ore supply had paralyzed all the other activities of the camp
as an idle man is always ripe for trouble report led up logically to the whiskydrinking and the cutting loose of big steve
bremerton listened quietly and when king paused remarked a wonder you didnot cut and run
but i was left in charge exclaimed the expert
it was my business to stay here no matter what happened
a quizzical light filled gray eyes yet he nodded soberly
i see
when a man does his best there is nothing more to be said
when did you have your last clean up at the mill just after the miners quit work
the millmen hung on for a while and i kept them busy scraping the plates
how did the cleanup pan out slim always slim and not what it ought to be what bothered lacey andand poor old griggsby
we mill ten tons of rock working both shifts
the orefeeder throws out every tenth shovelful as the ore goes into the hoppers
i quarter the samples down and get a value of twelve dollars and some odd cents to the ton no bonanza rock about that cut in bremerton been no bonanza rock milled since deane took over the property
if its here we havenot been able to find it
the tailings coming from the plates assay something over two dollars to the ton
the difference of about ten dollars a ton or a hundred dollars for a twentyfour hour millrun should be left on the plates
but it isnot there
the best we can show the best weve ever been able to show since deane secured this property is seven hundred to a thousand dollars for every two weeks cleanup
fifty dollars a day mused bremerton not enough to pay expenses being robbed
griggsby thought so and lacey was of the same opinion
but they couldnot prove anything
the leak wherever it is has been too well covered
you are right in saying we donot pay expenses with the mill
the cyanid plant is just able to cover the shortage
that of course doesnot leave anything for hes not running a mine for the love of it
no king he doesnot do much of anything for the mere love of it bremerton remarked dryly go into all this later
i havenot been myself for a couple of days and the ride from town rather fagged me
i think rest until after dinner
where do i bunk king got up and opened a door off the side of the room
here is where griggsby and lacey had their sleeping quarters said he
if youd rather not sleep here though theres a more comfortable place down at the laboratory
this will do
tell the miners to see me after the noon meal have them hereif theyll come
the man that doesnot come hunts another job
impress that on them
king left the office
as soon as he was gone bremerton got up went to the table and removed a handkerchiefwrapped package from one of the saddlebags
he unlocked the desk and pushed back the rolltop
a litter of papers lay under his eyes just as left by lacey
he brushed the papers aside untied the handkerchief seated himself and leaned forward to examine the ball of amalgam a clue all right he muttered a bit f luck right at the startoff see how that matches the mark on the mended chamois
the chamois skin dropped from the pocket of the unconscious big steve was an old one
almost in its very center a jagged tear had been mended with needle and thread
the sewing had been done by whipping the thread over and over along the edges of the tear leaving an upraised surface
this surface mark matched the indentation in the bottom of the amalgam ball perfectly
it was evidence indisputable evidence that the mended chamois had been used in squeezing some of the quicksilver out of that particular lump of amalgam
circumstances pointed a damning finger at big steve
they led also to interesting speculations regarding the finding of that stolen silver ball among the cottonwoods by the phoenix town canal
while bremerton bent thoughtfully over the desk a sheet of paper met his eye on top of the heap he had pushed aside
picking it out of the litter he read the following written in fine feminine chirography mr lacey if you will come to me at the arroyo at nine this evening i will tell you something of great importance to yourself
trust me this once and you will not regret it
mariquita maleory
bremerton dropped back in his chair a savage exclamation on his lips the note that lured lacey into a trap he murmured and dropped it on the desk and struck it with his clenched fist
a long hard ride from phoenix had almost worn him out
he had spent the whole of the preceding day in bed and every movement of his bruised limbs had brought him pain
in the small hours of that friday morning he had dressed bargained at the nearest corral for a horse and before sunrise had put miles behind him on the way to the mariquita mine
at first his stubborn will had to goad his battered body into action
as his ride progressed however his stiffened limbs and flagging muscles yielded with growing grace to the grim purpose that drove them
his iron physique dormant for a space recuperated swiftly
he was like a machine which slow to start at first presently yields to the spell of motion and runs with increasing ease and power
not until he entered the headquarters adobe had he been conscious of any feeling of fatigue
he had dismissed king and planned to lie down for a brief rest
but he could not leave the desk until he had tested the clue of the amalgam ball and the chamois skin and now that brief note from the mallory girl aroused feelings that made rest impossible
he got to his feet leaned against the top of the desk and swept his eyes around the office
there in premises just taken over by him griggsby and lacey had lived and and lacey the unfortunate men who had preceded him in the service of deane
the letterfiles on the shelf the map on the wall the cabinet of ore specimens the letterpress the table in the center of the room the picture of the martyred garfield hanging near the doorall these trifling details of the room appealed to him strongly
they constituted surroundings which griggsby and lacey had known to their sorrow
a black memory was over everything and the mallorys were the cause
bremerton frowning darkly swore to himself that he would bring home to the girl and her father the consequences of their deeds
making a winning proposition of the mariquita mine was but a part of his work the other part was to make sure that justice had her due
for the killing of griggsby the wounding of lacey and the work of that cowardly gang by the phoenix town ditch some one should pay
bremerton passed to the open door and leaned there looking out upon the camp
the mine lay in a shallow valley bordered with bleak hills covered with cactus clumps
the ramshackle structure housing the tenstamp mill stood at the left perched on the top of an incline of the valley floor
flanking the mill on one side were the cyanid tanks and hard by the tanks was the shakeroofed shakesided laboratory building
in the middle distance was the bunkhouse with its shattered windows
to the right of the bunkhouse stood the chuckshanty
beyond wun headquarters was a cleft in the valley wall in which were huddled the jacals of the mexicans
between mill and bunkhouse were posted the derricks with their whips and the shafthouse with its hoisting engine
the whole valley was gouged and gophered and sprinkled with heaps of country rock
the road from the shafts to the head of the mill had been powdered white by hoofs and wheels and gleamed in the sun like a trail of whitewash
there was nothing alluring in the scene nothing even picturesque
the valley wore a forbidding threatening look
like a long black serpent the pipeline trailed past the mexican quarter coiled around the chuckshanty and reared an ugly spouting head midway between the bunkhouse and the headquarters adobe
a branch of it crawled on to the cyanid tanks and the mill
silence brooded over the place
the men from the dry wash were loafing about the bunkhouse and there was activity manifested among the mexicans
big steve had ceased to rule the camp and the laborers were taking heart
a new superintendent had come and while he might not last long yet his protecting arm was over the property for a time at least
and price for this junkheap muttered bremerton is half a million
i am the connecting link between deane and that money his last chance his only hope for a big cleanup
well we shall see
if theres anything better than tendollar rock here going to find it
he left the door took an automatic revolver from one of the saddlebags and carried it with him into the sleepingroom
there was a musty smell in the cramped quarters and he raised a window
before lying down on the cot he placed the weapon handy by on a chair
with a sigh of relief he stretched himself out on the blankets of his creaking bed
he relaxed every tired muscle but he did not want to sleep and his mind kept busy
mentally he catalogued the successive steps of the work before him
first the mine must be put in running order
next the leak in the mill must be investigated
following that he would learn why the property had been called a bonanza with only tendollar rock finding its way to the stamps
a duty which might come first or last or distribute itself over the entire process of rehabilitating the mine was searching out the stealthy forces engaged in a deathgrapple with deane
to reorganize the workers and keep in motion the wheels of mining milling and cyaniding was the smallest part of problem
judgment and determination would take care of that
probing the thievery in the mill would not be so difficult now that bremerton had a reliable clue big steve was not a man to be discharged the superintendent now decided but to be retained kept at work and watched
he was the key to the missing amalgam
with only a tenstamp mill to grind out rock whose gross assay value was but little better than ten dollars to the ton the mariquita mine could never approach the splendid proportions of a bonanza property
here there was something wrong
deane was altogether too smart a speculator to be hooked by a job of salt
when he secured the mine he had certainly known what he was doing
nor would the mallorys fight so savagely to keep deane out of his rights if the object of that fight was such a poorpaying proposition as showed on its face
they must know something that old plotter and his girl
yet what was it they knew one answer to this question was a fabulously rich lead a lead known to the mallorys but lost to griggsby and lacey
while mallory had worked the mine under bond it had paid huge returns
those returns had captured the grasping fancies of deane men however had failed to make the mine pay anything more than running expenses
the only explanation of such a state of affairs was a rich vein on the property which had defied the efforts of griggsby and lacey to find it
it was possible that suqh a vein might have been worked out and exhausted
disputing this theory was the fact that the mallorys would not fight for a mine whose ore was hardly worth the trouble of digging and milling
no the mallorys had an object in keeping up that struggle with deane
there was a reef of gold which uncovered once must be brought to light again
as big steve was the key to the missing amalgam so the mallorys were a key to that lost lead thoughts covered these various topics slowly and methodically
he wanted to be sure of his ground as he mentally paced it off
two or three hours passed and he finally became aware that his eyes were absently regarding a framed photograph on the adobe wall
absorbed in his reflections he had looked at that picture without seeing it
now abruptly he recognized the original of the photograph and sat up suddenly on the cot
another picture framed among the cottonwoods and lighted with the moons beams flashed out before him
this picture on the wall was the same even to the lustrous tresses with the fullblown rose tangled among them
getting to his feet he walked around the foot of the cot and snatched the picture from the wall
it was framed in cactuswood and he stared at it with hard eyes
had griggsby placed it there
or lacey
he could not bring himself to think that either of his predecessors had been so foolish
very likely it was a souvenir of the days when mallory was working the mine
griggsby and lacey had merely left it hanging on the wall
bremerton muttered a fierce imprecation and drove his fist through the frame
twisting the cactuswood apart he flung the fragments out of the window
then he picked up the picture tore it in pieces and flung the scraps after the wreck of the frame no room here for even a picture of shedemon said bremerton with a scowl
a fine souvenir for me to look at
the eyes of a wildcat
every glance of them would remind me of the note that lured lacey into a trap
some one entered the outer room
a shuffling footstep crossed the floor halted and a thin voice called missa blemton
he stepped out of the sleeping apartment and found wun sing holding a covered tray and smiling blandly
what do you want sing he asked
me blingee chuck
missa king tellee me you sick
plaps you likee eatee chuck in office huh got it wrong not sick eat with the men sing
take the food back to the chuckshanty
wun face showed chagrin and disappointment
he wavered a moment then turned and shuffled toward the door
awri he remarked
ten minutes later bremerton sat at the head of a long table in the chuckshanty
at his right sat king
some twenty faces not one of the sort to inspire confidence ringed the table from king around to left
boys observed king a little doubtfully this is mr bremerton the new superintendent
one or two ducked their heads
a few more grufited
the majority merely stared and said nothing at all say anything if it hurts said bremerton with a quiet smile
you may not be glad to see me but donot do any guessing until were better acquainted
it must be rather pleasant for you to have a hot meal after a day or two of living on scraps in the dry wash
if you had helped king keep order in camp wun sing might have remained on the job
these words seemed to startle some of the men
a few exchanged glances but others bent sullenly over their plates
are these miners and millmen king inquired bremerton casually as he began eating
both was the reply along with the blacksmith and a couple of orehaulers
the rest of the men are keeping house in the mexican quarter
the men ate like famished animals but they cleaned their plates in a hurry and passed out of the shanty wait outside for you bremerton confided king in a shivering whisper miners and all
i told them you wanted to see them
if you donot raise their pay theyll start a riot not raise their pay and they wonot start any riot
bremerton picked up his hat from the floor beside his chair got to his feet and proceeded calmly through the door
filled with dire forebodings the little cyanid expert arose and followed
bremerton realized very well that his first real fight was just ahead of him
every man at table had passed under his keen scrutiny and been mentally tagged
so artfully was it done that the men themselves did not know it nor even king
here was a tool there a sneaking fomenter of discontent yonder a weak character who ran with the biggest pack
two had the courage to be openly defiant and but one of this pair was marked for a leader
so bremerton registered that tableful of workers
on the swiftness and sureness of his judgment he based his plans for dealing with the strikers
the men had formed themselves into a compact group a few yards from the door of the chuckshanty
their number had been increased by the arrival of mexican miners from the jacals and quite a formidablegathering awaited the new superintendent
it had been the privilege of all these miners to see latest recruit in action
they had been afforded a test of his mettle and a wholesome regard for his powers had been engendered in their minds
but there was a difference between big steve bryden charged with deviltry and aimlessly demoralizing the camp and a crowd of underground workers who presented a solid front of opposition and were swayed by a common cause
there was courage in numbers and the miners were eager to see how bremerton would meet this second test
if he weakened they would walk roughshod over his feeble authority
bremerton had halted just outside the chuckshanty door to fill and light his pipe
it looked like an attempt at bravado a bluff at hiding an attack of nerves and some of the strikers laughed jeeringly
king said bremerton who is the man with the rings in his ears that is chombo gonzales was the murmured response half american and half mexican a foreman among the diggers bremerton and a bad man to get stirred up
and whos the one with the scar on his right cheek
collins red collins another foreman
red is on the day shift and chombo looks after the night men
bremerton was positive that chombo and red were the two keys to that little difficulty
if the two foremen were properly taken care of the trouble in the underground workings would quickly adjust itself
the superinterident moved out toward the men the reason your men are not getting put the ore collins he asked
the red headed foreman felt flattered at being singled out in this way by bremerton
it gave him an importance which chombo resented with an ugly flash of the eyes
the boys think they ainot paid enough said collins
three dollars a day for ten hours is what they get and they demand four
why
because we want it thats why put in chombo jumping clear of the ranks and making it plain that he was to be considered in the discussion
bremerton turned on the halfblood and eyed him calmly talking with collins he remarked
when ready to talk with you youll have a chance to relieve your mind
you canot muzzle me cried chombo say what i please and when i please
bremerton peered at him ominously for a moment then swerved his gaze back to collins
how much are other mines in this district paying their miners he inquired
two and a half and three was the reply
then three dollars for ten hours is about the top price in other mines yes but its worth more to work at the mariquita
i understand the mariquita is the safest mine in the district no shoring necessary and quarters fairly comfortable
why it is worth more to work here because said collins the camp has a black name
for one thing too much shootin now and then thats liable to go wild for another thing deane got it on a plain steal and he ought to give up as much as can be gouged out o him
as for the shooting collins returned bremerton here to look out for that no concern of yours nor of any of the others
as for the way deane got hold of the property that is none of your business
the miners are paid a good price for working here and thats enough
you canot crowd us with no such talk shouted chombo excitedly have our rights or well have nothing
we give you your rights gonzales cut in bremerton
come to the office in ten minutes and get your time
chombo stared his lean body crouching and his ugly little eyes blinking
por dios he gritted
you canot fire me
but i have asserted bremerton done your last stroke of work at the mariquita mine and as soon as youre paid off you will take yourself out of camp not have a cur of your stripe hanging around here
chombo had been fingering at the breast of his flannel shirt
king suddenly uttered a cry of warning
quick as thought the right hand had executed a movement backward and forward and from his tawny fingers had shot a bright gleam of steel
bremerton fell sidewise
the gleam grazed his shoulder flew on to the side of the chuck shanty and struck and hung with a steady glitter
it was a knife blazing in the sun and the point was embedded in the board wall
the tragic silence that followed the knifethrowing lasted for a brief moment
bremerton righted himself lifted a hand and the stillness was broken by the sharp report of a revolver
the sound faded into a cry of pain and chombo stood reeling on his feet his left hand clasping his right arm and a trickle of red oozing from between his fingers
try that again snapped bremerton and be more particular about my shooting
king he added take him to the office and pay him off then watch while he gets a good start along the trail
collins step over this way
chombo was cowed and had nothing to say
the rest of the miners watched while king trembling and distraught moved toward the office with the halfblood staggering behind him
the cyanid expert was expecting a clash in which bremerton would get far and away the worst of it
bremerton however remembered how those men had kept to the dry wash and the mexican quarter while big steve was on parade and he knew they dared not resent his treatment of chombo 
the redhajred collins moved in direction but he came humbly and obediently as one who had just endured a shock and was slowly recovering his wits
the superintendent led him aside
how much are you getting as foreman collins inquired bremerton
three and a half
the miners are getting every cent they are entitled to
i guess you know this mine is barely paying expenses and if the pay is raised all around i shall have to call on deane to cover a shortage lookout not ours my lookout not make no mistake on that score
you are a man of influence collins
i can see that
if you tell these miners theyre getting the limit theyll believe you
in your case willing to make an exception
if you can get them back to work and keep them at work from now on your wages will be five dollars a day
you need not say anything about that if you donot want to
this is the only concession i will make
if those men donot begin getting out ore this afternoon they can come for their time this evening
greed showed in narrowing eyes to have five a day am he demanded
yes so long as you keep the gang at work on bremerton but keep it quiet see that they go to work
without paying any further attention to the strikers the superintendent walked on to the office
chombo was moving off along the road tying up his arm with a red cotton handkerchief as he went
king his face pale under its tan stood in the office door
letting chombo go said he will raise the deuce among the mexicans a clannish lot bremerton
i wish explained that to you before
bremerton laughed softly as he pushed past the little cyanid man and dropped into the chair in front of the rolltop desk
would you put up with chombo after what happened if you had been in my place he asked
whatever have done would probably have been the wrong thing was the answer
but its the devils own job here at the mariquita to know whats best to do in the pinches
it strikes me that the first step is to get rid of the troublemakers fired one and bribed another all in the interests of peace
the ore will begin to come king
the men are going back to work yes
well by gracious
king was looking out of the door
collins seems to be arguing with the men and theyre moving toward the shafthouse
how did you do it bremerton i made it worth while for collins to line up on our side
the work must go on here
after got better acquainted with the situation it may not be necessary to handle collins with gloves see about that later
start the cyanid gang at once
if you have any further trouble with them call me
king taking fresh heart left the headquarters adobe and started toward the tanks
he found his own workers in a most receptive frame of mind
not one of them had any faultto find over the treatment of chombo
later in the afternoon the teamsters were hauling ore to the platform at the head of the mill
the stamps were pounding and a batteryman was temporarily looking after big part of the work
only a few hours had passed since the new superintendent had arrived at the demoralized camp and already the work of mining and milling had been resumed and the big vats were being loaded with tailings for another run
if bremerton can only last king was saying to himself well do something here yet
the night shift took hold of the work in mine and mill when the day crews left off and bremerton slept that night with the roar of the stamps filling the valleyten 850pound hammers each falling at the rate of ninetyeight times to the minute beating out gold for ultimate success with the eastern syndicate
big steve was sleeping off his spree in the bunkhouse the vengeful chombo might be plotting somewhere in the hills and the gang under leadership of the mallorys was probably making ready for the next move
none of these things bothered bremerton
it was his part to take his difficulties as they came and deal with them as his judgment counseled at the moment
he had made a good start and for the present that sufficed
a saturday and sunday passed without bringing any fresh difficulties for the new superintendent
the camp which clung to that seared and blighted valley like a barnacle to the hulk of some weatherbeaten ship resounded with the peaceful activities of mining and milling
the distant hills were blue and serene and gave not the slightest hint of harboring enemies who were eager to stalk and slay
bremerton settled comfortably into the routine of his work
he came and went about the mining property with the perfect nonchalance of one to whom fear and worry are unknown
bart case otherwise known as smear one of the orehaulers remarked upon the supers calmness and apparent ease of mind
he addressed himself to dutch fred the other teamster
the fool ainot got sense enough to know hes a marked man dutch
vat i care was the passiveresponse a goner in two weeks i bet you you bet i donot care nuther but itll be plumb interestin to bet and then watch for what happens
lay you a dozen bags o smokin hes still on the job come two weeks saturday
i donot get smoking much easier as dot smear a go
in this manner tenure of life become a gamble among the men
but smear was unjust
the superintendent was not a fool
he understood thoroughly that he was gambling with fate
the stake was large however and he was cheerfully taking a gamblers chance
monday morning two events came to pass
one bremerton was expecting
the other was a surprise
directly after breakfast big steve holloweyed his cheeks flabby and of a sickly yellow tinge tramped heavily into the office and ranged himself alongside the desk
he emitted a rasping cough by way of claiming the superintendents attention
bremerton was studying a penciled map of the mariquita property
he did not look up until big steve had brought a hamlike fist smasing down on the desk top
think going to wait here all day demanded the amalgamator after my time
bermerton sat back and regarded the huge form fixedly
oh its you is it he asked
yes its me and here for my money
going to quit the flabby jaw fell open and the sunken eyes stared that what you said demanded big steve you tell the boys to break it to me that i was fired
i believe i did but changed my mind
bryden we heed an amalgamator merely assess you for the bunkhouse windows and keep you on if youve a mind to stay
big steve drdw his thick fingers across his head in a puzzled way then thinking bremerton was afraid to discharge him he laughed craftily
oh stay but i donot pay for no bunkhouse windows only fair that you pay for them but not insist
go up to the mill
the amalgamator tramped out a little more heavily than he had tramped in
the new boss was afraid to give him his walking papers
he looked back at the door and chuckled in his hairy throat
some time hed have another chance at bremerton and theyd see which of em could run that camp
he was pawing the bruise on his temple and still chuckling as he walked to the head of the mill
king little as he knew about the management of men thought that bremerton had made a grave mistake
at any cost bryden should have been made to go
among themselves the men wondered
most of them came to the same conclusion as big steve and thought that bremerton was afraid to get rid of the amalgamator
others who remembered chombo and the way bryden had been manhandled at the climax of his lawlessness could not accept the easier conclusion and were at a loss to understand the queer move
the superintendent was well content to let the matter rest as it was so long as his real reason for keeping bryden in the mill was not known
he was also chuckling over the incident when a beat of approaching hoofs drew his eyes to a nearby window
from the rim of the valley a rider was advancing along the trail
the rider was a woman
she sat her horse manwise and her graceful figure swayed rhythmically as she galloped face hardened
talk about nerve he muttered
i told her to keep away from me yet here she comes
well he added grimly when shes done with this visit shell never make another
he started to rise preparatory to leaving the office and meeting the girl outside
something held him to his chair however and glued his eyes to the window
mariquita mallory presented a picture beautiful by contrast with that seared and blasted valley
it was not that she rode with skill and grace
it was the girl herself that added a touch to the ugly environmenta softening exquisite touch which caught and held eyes in spite of him
there was a place in the mogollons where the sun sets as nowhere else in the whole world
he had camped on the spot for a week just to see the flaming ball go down watch the crimson and gold fade and then feast his eyes on the purple afterglow
it was a far cry from the mogollons to the bitter root range in montana and yet bremerton knew of a height in the bitter roots where the sun never rose as it rose there
in the southwest the brazen shield pops upward from the deserts rim as though flung abruptly from a mighty hand
one moment it is dawn and the next day
but over that height in the bitter roots it comes slowly flinging out streamers that grow and grow until the whole east is filled with orange and yellow and the faint western stars are blotted out one by one
bremerton had a soul for the finer things of life
he saw beauty where others would pass it by
with the eye of an artist he watched that free galloping figure
the girl wore a broadbrimmed hat
her costume was mannish in other ways and yet oddly enough there was that about her which made it feminine to the last degree
bremerton was still staring as she drew close
their eyes met through the dusty window
she smiled and waved a gauntleted hand
his face grew stony with the dark thoughts that suddenly surged within him
he did not get up and leave the headquarters adobe to meet her
whirling the chair to face the door he watched while she dropped the reins dismounted lightly and stepped across his threshold
good morning mr bremerton she said still smiling
he noted the clear soft brown face the comely roundness of the cheek the arch of the throat the castilian languor of the big dark eyes
moonlight has a magic of its own but it could not add to the charms of mariquita mallory
there in broad day she was infinitely more attractive than when bremerton had seen her among the cottonwoods
why donot you say something queried the silvery voice
am i welcome or am i not
like dagger thrusts the words of lacey pierced brain
when she smiled i found my danger greatest
and mariquita mallory was smiling
i told you said bremerton to keep away from me
you couldnot have meant it though she laughed not really
she dropped her head on one side and looked at him critically in much better shape than when i say you last you glad i made you take silverheels and ride to the hotel
and youve never said gracias
perhaps come to give you the chance to say that
then i thank you for something which i do not look upon as an obligation he returned
that is gratitude with a string tied to it
she laughed
but no matter
when were better acquainted mr bremerton i think youre going to like me
i donot mind saying that rather predisposed ia your favor already
i know what you hare done herehow you clipped the spurs of big steve and winged chombo made a very good beginning mr bremerton
are you willing to listen to me
if youre going to say anything against deane the black eyes kindled the smile faded and left the lips stern
i amjust that she cut in
then i am not going to listen to you
he got slowly out of his chair and approached her
miss mallory he went on you are a woman a very beautiful woman and you are not going to make me forget that i am a man and fighting a mans fight
it is a fight that i shall win
you and your father are enemies
i have reason to believe that you fight friends from cover with a reckless disregard of life and consequences
but you and your father are not going to stand in my way
take my advice and leave this part of the country before i bring home to you something which will call for a penalty
save yourselves while there is time
there was interest in her eyes and she did net seem displeased
you are taking the wrong trail she returned earnestly
i can explain that to you if you will let me
you cannot afford to make a mistake mr mistake so hideous and farreaching as this of yours is bound to be
let me tell you not a word
miss mallory you must know i could not believe you
you have been talking with mr lacey
naturally i saw him as soon as i could after reaching phoenix
that is no secret to you or your father
i was spied upon from the moment i left the train
otherwise that gang of hoodlums would not have been ready for me
his voice was tinged with bitterness
she stepped back and her eyes began to glow again
i have told you we had nothing to do with that villainous attack upon you she cried
he waved his hand i have a fair amount of raso and judgment he replied and you had best give me credit for that right from the beginning
deane will never be able to accomplish anything here she declared sharply no matter who takes up the work for him
i should hate to see you go the way griggsby went or suffer as lacey has suffered
i want to help you
then keep hands off
call away your gang
by doing that you will not only help me but help yourself a good deal more
we want peace but not at that price
if it is to be war between you and my father and me it is war of your own bringing
call it what you will i am here to serve deane
then you are serving a scoundrel she flamed
with a superb dramatic gesture she pulled the gauntlet from her left hand and flung it down in front of him
you will bring that back to me on your knees before you are done with the mallorys she cried and whirled and ran from the office
he picked up the glove curiously wonderingly while the beat of her horses hoofs died swiftly away along the trail that led out of the valley
actress muttered bremerton actress to the core
he threw the small glove upon the table with an angry gesture
so i am to take that back to her on my knees am i he pictured himself crawling at the feet of mariquita mallory and humbly lifting that gage of battle which she had flung at him
a grim smile curled his lips
i wonder if she takes me for a coward or a sentimental fool he felt as though he had just come off the stage after taking part in a scene from a melodrama
his annoyance was keen and he was surprised a moment later to find himself beside the table and again holding the glove in his hands
the girl was twofaced in his own mind there could be no doubt about that
and yet there was something undeniably attractive about her something winsome appealing
he would have given a months pay to hear the truth in the matter of deal for the mariquita mine
but from what unprejudiced source was the truth to come
certainly not from the girl
lacey had found her mosli dangerous when she smiled
bremer ton ground out an exclamation and crushed the glove in his strong fingers unlocking a drawer of the desk he dropped miss property into it along with the ball of amalgam and the mended chamois skin and turned the key on the collection
the gleaming ball reminded him that he had work to do and he left the office and mounted the low incline that led to the mill
a man on the ore platform was shoveling rock into the crusher
the superintendent picked up a piece at random and examined it
it was fairly good ore but not the kind that would make the mariquita worth half a million dollars
he tossed the sample into the hopper and climbed through an opening in the rough board wall and descended three or four steps to the ore loft
the stampstems of the two batteries were lifting and falling with a force that shook the old mill in every part
the uproar was deafening so close at hand
the crusherman was also the orefeeder and while he was busy on the platform outside bremerton had the oreloft to himself
making his way between the batteries of dancing stampstems he halted at the edge of the loft and looked down into the body of the mill
directly beneath him were the millplates covered with a thin sheet of flowing water
the water was stained with the powdered ore washed away from the stamps and carried through the battery screen to the plates
the quicksilver on the plates captured the gold from the muddy tide and held it fast
for one reason or another a small quantity of the yellow metal would not catch and the water carried it out of the mill and away to the tailings piles
giles the batteryman sat in the aisle between the plates keeping a vigilant eye upon the boxes and smoking as he watched
at the rear of the mill big steve leaned against a bench tying a fresh cloth over the wide mouth of a bottle of quick
through the door leading into the engine room bremerton could see the engineer who was his own fireman heaving crooked lengths of mesquit and paloverde into the firebox
it was a scene of peaceful activity and offered not the slightest hint of dishonest motives on the part of any of the workers
and yet if there was a leak and if through it amalgam was dribbling away from deane then more than one man in that mill had a hand in the plot
bremerton became suddenly aware that big steve had finished tinkering with the bottle of quicksilver and was looking upward at the edge of the oreloft
a complacent slightly contemptuous grin creased the flabby face of the amalgamator
bremerton met the uplifted glance quietly and big steve dropped his eyes and shouted something to giles
the batteryman bounded up the steps to the loft and began hanging up the stamps
one by one with a piece of board he lifted each stamp in one of the batteries and left it hanging and idle
there is a knack in the work and giles proved his efficiency by doing it deftly and quickly
the roar of the mill was now decreased by half and bremerton was able to compliment giles without shouting at the top of his voice
giles was minus an eye but the eye that was left gleamed with pride as he listened to the approval of the new superintendent
if big steve had a confederate bremerton was sure it could not be giles
he had not the air of a man with a guilty conscience
if there was any fault to be found with giles it was because he could not see as much crookedness with one eye as he might have seen with his normal equipment
bremerton descended a flight of narrow stairs to the body of the mill
big steve was just coming out from under the oreloft where he had been turning the water off from the battery
he pulled a stubby whiskbroom from his pocket and stepped to the side of the plate
looking over the mill he asked of bremerton casually
bremerton nodded
big steve began passing the broom over the plate in wide vigorous circles
the amalgam ridged and loosened under the sweeping splints
big steve laid aside the broom and took a square of rubber from his coat
cleaning up a little asked the new superintendent pleasantly
got to was the reply stick
liable to shuff off and ride out with the tailings in chunks
bremerton knew better
the amalgam was safe enough and there was no need of removing any from the plate
big steve was lying
this was part of his method in lifting gold
he pushed the rubber across and across the plate molded two balls of amalgam in his hands and laid them aside oh a piece of chamois skin
after that he scattered quicksilver from the bottle upon the plate dressed the plate down with the broom called to giles to start the stamps again and went into the little amalgamators room off the side of the mill
bremerton followed and watched
big steve by manner rather than words seemed to consider his presence an intrusion
how many times a day do you make this partial cleanup bryden the superintendent asked
four
the amalgamator was gathering a ball up in the chamois
his big fists clamped down on it tight and the quick oozed through the skin and dropped into a bowl
two balls each time
big steve removed the first ball laid it on a shelf behind him and then began squeezing the second ball
working at the amalgamators back bremerton drew a knife from his pocket opened the blade and with its point made a cross on the lower surface of the first ball of amalgam
the maneuver was entirely lost on big steve
i donot reckon well get two balls every partial cleanup this run said the amalgamator suddenly as though his heavy wits had been struggling with question and his own answer purty lowgrade compared with what it is usually
bremerton strolled out of the little room across the body of the mill through the engineers quarters and around to where king was working at the cyanid tanks
what does bryden do with the amalgam he takes from the plates during the day king
bremerton inquired
turns itover to me when he knocks off work in the afternoon was the reply
night amalgamator does the same thing in the morning
why
oh nothing just getting the run of the details
after supper this evening bring amalgam to the office
the little experts eyes widened
you donot think for a minute that big steve he began but the superintendent cut him short bother about what i think king
whatever it is be sure it is nothing to your discredit
just bring up the amalgam this eveningand keep the matter quiet
bremerton went back to the office and resumed his study of the mariquita property as outlined on the map holdings comprised several claims all known by the one general name and completely filled the little valley and lapped over upon the hills that bordered it
where was the bonanza ledge the golden reef which had dazzled deane while the mine was in the hands of mallory or carruthers
bremerton could have sworn that it was somewhere under that scoriated valley and just as surely as it was there so surely would he one day discover it
for the rest of the morning and all the afternoon he smoked and reflected the map under his eyes
his next step was to go over the property foot by foot and endeavor to locate the lost vein
next day he would begin
following supper and after the day men had retired to their quarters and the night men had gone into mine and mill for their work king came with a canvas bag and rolled four balls of amalgam out upon the office table
is that all big steve turned in bremerton inquired
certainly replied king with a pained look
i hope bremerton you donot think hold out anything on you
bosh not your trail on
how does the ore now running through the mill compare in value with the ore of the last run it is almost identically the same so far as value is concerned
and the amount milled is the same yes
bryden says it is his practise to have a partial cleanup four times during his shift and that generally he gets two balls of amalgam from each plate every time he takes the stuff off
according to that there should be sixteen balls of amalgam in this lot
where are the other twelve king appeared astounded
he never turns in any more than this bremerton
probably big steve is a bit hazy yet and didnot realize what he was saying
or you may have misunderstood him
he was sober enough and i didnot misunderstand him
bremerton looked at the balls
the one he had marked was not among them
well he added presently of all the brazen stealing i ever heard of this is the limit
he leaned back in his chair peered into startled face and laughed
what was the matter with griggsby and lacey that they did not find the leak in the mill he went on
it is so confoundedly simple that a blind man could locate it not blind parried king
it got past me bremerton
and griggsby and lacey worried their heads off about the failure of the cleanups to tally with my assay figures
take the amalgam back and put it in the laboratory safe king said the superintendent quietly explain matters to you later on
i know why the bullion doesnot tally with your assays of the millrun but there are a few other things i donot know and which i must find out as quickly as possible
keep your own counsel get to the bottom of this and something will drop and drop hard before many days a wonder by glory that this mine is doing as well as it is everything considered
king toqk his bag of amalgam and went back to the laboratory
he was sorely puzzled and halfinclined to doubt statement regarding the discovery of the leak
of griggsby bremerton knew little but for lacey bremerton cherished the respect which one man of resolution and ability will always feel for another of his kind
a square look was all bremerton had needed to get measure
and how had it been possible for big steve so clumsy and barefaced in his thieving to pull the wool over eyes
the deeps of human nature are a tangle of mystery
why or wherein lacey had failed or what he might ultimately have accomplished had he been left to go on with his work bremerton could not pretend to guess
but this matter of big steve and the missing amalgam had yielded so readily to investigation that the blindness of predecessors especially of a thing for wonder
bremerton reflected that his very first day at the mine had given him a clue
that clue had infallibly involved bryden
this advantage however did not tell the whole story of and carelessness or incompetence
it may be thought bremerton that big steve worked differently when lacey was in charge
the truth may come out sometime
i canot believe that lacey was so gullible as the developments seem to indicate
he need not bother about lacey
it was his own battle and not he was fighting
there was work to be done that night
closing and locking the desk he got up and walked into his sleeping room
when he came out into the main office he had the automatic pistol in his hand
he examined the weapon for a moment under the light then dropped it into his pocket
with a whiff down the lamp chimney he filled the room with darkness
a moment later he passed through the door and turned the key in the lock behind him
moving on the bunkhouse through the gloom he took up a position behind a heap of stonesa position from which he could watch the quarters of the sleeping dayshift
he wanted to be at the mill so that he might test the night amalgamator as he had tested big steve
that part of his plans would have to wait for the present
it was big trail he was following and he must run it out
there was no one abroad in the camp it that hour
the night men in the mill and in the underground workings had no cause to leave their posts
the blacksmith had pointed a supply of drills for those in the levels and stopes and the teamsters had heaped the ore platform with plenty of rock for the stamps
those of the camp who were not on duty slept while the mill roared and the ore gathered at the bottoms of the shafts
bremerton ran no risk of discovery
such risks as there were would come later if the superintendents vague hopes were realized
big steve sure of himself and careless in his villainy was still the peg upon which bremerton hung his plans
where had bryden put those twelve balls of amalgam
even he would realize the danger of secreting them in the bunk house
he would not let the night passso the superintendent reasoned without clearing away the evidence of his crookedness
the time dragged slowly
a lessened clamor from the mill suggested the hanging up of a battery and the removal of amalgam from the plates
the night amalgamator was cutting his cloth according to big pattern and all to the financial loss of deane
the mariquita mine it seemed was being assailed from without and within
the mallorys and their gang were not sole enemies
there were traitors in camp with whom there must be a reckoning before a searchlight could be turned on the methods of the mallorys
all in good time muttered bremerton grimly and meanwhile one thing at a time
the old mill crashing and clanging gleaming yellow through every crack in the rough walls and pouring its smoke straight toward the stars was a weird and fascinating object
it crouched on the crest of its little hill like some sulky misshapen devil growling as it gnashed at the ore and wheezing as it spewed the thick fog out of the tall black stack
bremerton was oddly attracted by that ramshackle structure flaming and howling in the night
his eyes shifted from the mill to the bunkhouse and back again almost continually
perhaps he had been at the rock heap two hours perhaps three when a moving blot emerged from the bunkhouse shadows and glided toward the trail that led out of the valley
bremerton chuckled
his vague hopes were being realized
as the shadowy blur lost itself behind the headquarters adobe and reappeared in the starlight beyond he left his hiding place and cautiously followed
once clear of the ruck of the camp the form from the bunk house was thrown into clearer prominence
it was the form of a large steve without a doubtbearing a sack over his shoulder
the amalgamator followed the trail
bremerton more circumspect dodged from one clump of greasewood to another at the trailside
at the top of the rise to the south big steve turned directly out of the road and moved westward along the ridge
bremerton kept below the crest of the uplift
at a distance it might have been of a quarter of a mile fte man with the bag descended the opposite slope and passed from sight
the millclamor was hushed so that the shrill cries of the coyotes could be heard
creeping things to which bremerton gave no heed scuttled out of his way
he looked down from the ridgetop upon a narrow level of desert at the farther side of which were more hills and the mouth of an arroyo
big steve was laying a straight course for the arroyo
he paused once to emit a whistle
the signal was answered
against the arroyo black as a pocket a point of light flared fluttered and died out
bremerton crawled over the top of the ridge and with redoubled caution let himself down the slope
here and there on the level were bits of chaparral
from screen to screen of bushes he moved and finally was as close to the mouth of the arroyo as he could go without inviting discovery
he heard a mumble of words
big steve was talking with some one whom he had met
a match was lighted and the speck of fire hung over a pipe between the amalgamators lips
hardly a breath of air was stirring and that faint glow did not waver
big steve sat on a boulder
the figure beside him bent to pick up the bag he had carried from the bunkhouse
the face of the stooping form came within the dim circle of light from the match
it was face and the light glittered on the rings in his ears
there was a sling of white cloth suspended from the neck and in the fold of it his right hand rested
there could not be the least doubt regarding the identity of chombo
here was positive evidence of conspiracy
chombo had assisted big steve in his stealings while employed at the mine and he was still active now that he had been discharged
how many of those rough workers at the mine were honest and loyal to deane
the scene at the mouth of the arroyo suggested the question to bremerton and he was in a mood to distrust every man in the camp except king
where doubledealing was possible owing to laxity of those in control nearly every one would be found with a hand in it
it was up to bremerton to make the thieving impossible
the first step to that end would be accomplished by making objectlessons of big steve and chombo
when the two in the mouth of the arroyo separated the amalgamator returned toward the mill by the way he had come and the halfblood faded into the dark of the narrow valley
bremerton allowed big steve to go his way and pressed forward into the arroyo
his object was to discover if he could where the stolen amalgam was taken by chombo
in this he failed
chombo had vanished completely and to prowl aimlessly around in an attempt to locate him might have resulted in disaster to the superintendent
an examination of the arroyo could wait until the following day
the heavy gloom made a night search worse than useless
bremerton started back towards the ridge
as he was climbing the slope a rider galloped along the ridgetop coming suddenly from nowhere and flinging along in the direction of the trail
his jaws clamped hard and his brows wrinkled as he stood and gazed
the rider was cut sharply in silhouette against the lighter background of the night sky
that swinging graceful figure the broadbrimmed hat the fluttering hair he could not be mistaken
it was mariquita mallory
the girl was swallowed up in the shadows as suddenly as she had appeared
bremerton muttered angrily
why was she there
had she a part in that scoundrelly work at the mill
was there really but one set of enemies fighting deane
were the foes within the camp linked in deviltry with those outside
were they all working together to drive deane out of that mining district somewhere deep down in soul lurked a sense of disappointment
he realized that he had been hoping against hope that mariquita mallory in the face of all that had happened might be as inoncent of actual wrongdoing as she had professed to be
but evidence was piling upon evidence to prove the contrary
big steve the thief had met chombo another thief in the hills
the girl was there not present at the meeting but handily by to take from chombo the bag of stolen amalgam
quite likely the bag lay across the saddle in front of her as she galloped away not make a fool of me as she did of lacey bremerton growled
he had said that before
why was he harping on it did he feel himself slipping and was he unwittingly making a stand against an event altogether possible his spirit was up in arms against himself
while climbing the slope and striding along the ridge his thoughts circled around ways and means for gathering both mallorys in the same snare he was preparing for big steve and chombo
if shes in this he vowed shell pay for it
i warned her
whatever the cost these foes of are to be put out of business
they canot wipe me out before had my way with them
when he had got back to the headquarters adobe and had locked himself in the stuffy rooms he lpoked at his watch and found that it was two oclock
his work for the next day and for many days to follow was cut out for him
it was time he was in bed
his thoughts however gave him no rest
he fumbled for his keys and started to open the drawer containing the ball of amalgam and the other things and angrily caught himself up short
what do i want to look at that stuff for he mentally asked himself
and he had no logical answer for the question
the mallorys were with the amalgam thieves
otherwise how it was that he found that first ball of amalgam on the scene of his struggle by the phoenix town ditch as guilty as the rst of them he muttered savagely
with that conclusion firmly in mind he dismissed the whole subject of his nights work and went to bed
the entrance of michael ohara upon the gloomy scenes of this chronicle was excellently timed for bremerton
a sordid struggle inspired by the greed of men blackened by treachery and tragedy and with a plaintive note of injustice to some one somewhere ringing through it all needs the touch of an ohara to renew faith in the fitness of things as they are
he should have been played on with a rollicking quickstep but not too wild not too clashing
a nocturne perhaps in twofour time dreamy in places but with here and there a laugh at the world for its follies
mostly the strings if you please with a lilting of the woodwind and once or twice but no more the drums and the brasses
that was the spirit of the ohara the soul of him
but there was trouble in setting it to music
for this reason may bp he chose personally to express himself through his own flute
he came suddenly
it was a habit he had
and gently and unobtrusively
that was another habit
bremerton had first discovered him in the desert
his burro was dead his food and water were gone
with his back to a sahuara cactus he was waiting for the and trying to breathe out his soul through the flute with the harp that once thro halls
for two years after that he and bremerton were inseparable
they found gold those two but it was the gold in each others heart
they struggled they starved they broke rock and ripped holes in the flinty earth and they sfettled down at last to sink a shaft on the light of hope their only find
but the light went out and hope died and they had a hole in the ground for their pains
between two days ohara decamped leaving a note and sixteen silver dollars for bremerton
the note said briefly fight for you die for you but all hell canot make me saddle you longer with the cursed luck of the oharas
the sixteen dollars were all he had in the world
and when he went it was afoot leaving the burro and all the meager grubpack for bremerton
high and low bremerton searched for him but whenever ohara effaced himself he did it thoroughly
no trace of the irishman could bremerton find
for many a month after that heart was sore
ohara had come into his life shortly after deane had gone out of it and the loss was a blow
the friendship of the right man for another who is right is one of the greatest gifts of god
and it never ends here or hereafter
on the morning after his nights work in the hills bremerton was wakened by soft music outside his door
thrilled he sat up on the cot and greedily drank in the melody
he was happy but he was not precipitate
the ways of the man outside were known to him and he deferred to them
to the strains of mollie he got up deliberately and put on his clothes
when he was quite ready he went into the outer office and unlocked and opened the door
a hatless man with red hair sat on his doorstep playing a flute
not by the wildest flight of fancy could the man be called handsome
his nose was short and his upper lip was long
his eyes were a washedout blue and while one of them looked straight at you the other surveyed the landscape
he was lean and long doubled up as he was his knees all but touching his chin his length was painfully in evidence
but he was comfortably clad
in fact his whole appearance radiated prosperity
it was not an effusive prosperity but an ample amount for creature comforts
with one eye fixed on bremerton and the other looking around the corner of the adobe he continued his playing
bremerton took a chair and sat down
after mollie had been played up and down and across with trills and variations and the chorus three times repeated the player took the flute from his lips and pushed it into a new green cloth bag
come in ohara said bremerton calmly
i owe you sixteen dollars
divil a cent do you owe me and the wide mouth of ohara opened in a roar of laughter owing you a thousand this minute bremerton and no one has been able to see me for dust in the rush made looking for you changed a little a very little for ohara or never have ventured to run onto your trail
the debt you mind could have been canceled by post
he pulled himself up from the step shook his angular frame and came into the little room
twisting a package of banknotes out of an inside pocket he flung it to bremerton
well by glory
bremerton stared at the money as though hypnotized
a thousand plunks said ohara grinning
count em
where have you made a raise mike
and why in blazes am i entitled to a share in it so youll be lookin a gift horse in the mouth will you
shame on you for tryin to dodge good money at the hand of a friend no safe been crackin no strongarm work in it at all at all
och my boy you could never guess
we thought it a limestone stringer with not much under the grassroots but heartache and disappointment
sure we never made a bigger mistake
lee the old light has made good to the chune of a couple of thousand
by the same token your half is there in that wad
now will you behave bremerton looked incredulous
ohara hastened to explain
this is the way of it and on my soul you canot be more surprised than i was when the miraculous truth hit me in the face
tis six months gone since i was near that spot where we lived and labored and lost faith
i went to see that beautiful hole over which wed cracked our backs and will you believe me it was deeper than when we left it and a bit of a crosscut had been run and six men were takin out ore that would have made your eyes bulge
the claim had been jumped so help me
and why not with no assessment work done for a year
oh the fools we were not to be thinkin of that crosscut
bremerton was dumfounded
and yet he need not have been
occasionally such things are happening in the mining country and as long as men dig for gold they will continue to happen
but the two thousand said bremerton
if the claim was jumped i donot see why the newcomers had to buy it
tis there the laugh comes in proceeded ohara crinkling his crossed eyes
it was in my name do you mind and you had a quitclaim to half
my location was filed but you hadnot taken the trouble to file your quitclaim
they knew of me those claimjumpers and they imagined trouble where none could be made and gave me the two thousand to sheer off
i got it without passin my hat and he wrapped his long legs around the chair and nearly choked with mirth
never before for bremerton had fortune gone to such lengths to give him a bit of a smile
he appreciated the humor of it yet if he had not the wild joy of ohara would have forced a laugh out of sheer sympathy
the best part of it mike said bremerton is that luck has turned for you
faith was the response the longest lane is bound to have a turn
not being able to turn for the worse it had to be for the better
as soon as i had the money in my jeans i set off looking for you
the divils own chase you led me
here you were grubstakin for a month in the hills and there youd come in with your chuck gone and the burro no more than skin and bones
maybe it was carpenter work you did or clerkin in a store or drivin stage until youd amassed enough capital for another pasear in the wilds
och lad but youre a hard one to come up with when the gold fevers in you and the heart of you cryin for the lonesome trails
but i kept along until i found the place where you skinned yourself of your property to buy a ticket to denver
then i knew and the smiling face went long and the faded mismatched eyes grew dull
i knew by my soul that youd knuckled under to deane
ohara had no use for deane
an honest irishman no matter if he is out at elbows will think of his codscience twice for every once you mention a pirate
only continued ohara i wished to high heaven got to you with the thousand in time
for what have you sold yourself lee
a paragraph in the papers let me know you were here and that deane had hired you to lay out this property butterside up
what was the price
a grim smile flickered across the others lean face
if you think sold my birthright for a mess of pottage mike said hd youll have to guess again
now listen going to tell you something confide to no other living soul and i want you to get it straight
he went into his arrangement with deane exhaustively
not only that but he followed his own trail down from denver to the hospital with lacey to the cottonwoods by the phoenix town canal to the mine and at last to the mouth of the arroyo
bremerton could speak to ohara as to no one else
his beliefs his hopes his intentions were all laid naked before the eyes of his friend
he had no need to tell of his confidence in deane for that tingled in every word of his talk
but he did declare his black suspicions of mariquita mallory and there was a false note struck again and again as he emphasized his convictions
ohara loved to drink in the music but he hated the discord
man dear but youre out of chune and he wabbled his red head gruesomely
the girl is a fiend of course
lacey say so
he has judgment and penetration although to be sure he couldnot find the hole in the mill where the amalgam ran out but that was simple and eye was all for complications human nature and bitter true that wed rather take a week hunting for something than travel cross lots for an hour and pick it up
but if there was any doubt o the girls duplicity you settled it
beyond a shadow of surmise in the twice you talked with her and the once you saw her gallopin through the night you smoked out her true character
oh the black trick she played on you there by the town ditch
forced her horse on you at the muzzle of a gunmade you ride when you could not walkbullied you into a comfortable trip back to your hotel
troth in hopes to be spared till i can get even with her for that
it was worse though when she came here and wanted to be friends
you were right in not letting her speak of the mine or give you the whys and wherefores of the sorrywork that has been going on here
she might have exploded some dynamite under that trust you have in deane
then what
no matter the glove
begorry and a wry smile came into the homely face like to take it back to her myself and tell her a few things
bremerton a mind to camp down on you for a while
you need me
but be no deadhead work
but you donot understand i understand more than you think
before long therell be more broken heads in these diggins than there ever was at a donnybrook fair
for one of my disposition the outlook is distinctly allurin going to work here
where are you going to work laughed bremerton
in the mill
about tomorrow youll be needing a new amalgamator and the man for the job
then thats settled and i could ask nothing better
there goes the gong at the chuckshanty mike
come on to breakfast
bremerton planned a surprise for big steve and chombo
the law was to be invoked against them and the case relentlessly pressed
such a move would constitute an object lesson for all the enemies of deane
king was sent to phoenix directly after breakfast tocommunicate plans to the sheriff
as a cover to the real nature of his errand it was given out in camp that he had gone to town for a couple of carboys of sulphuric acid
in looking over the odds and ends of equipment in the office the superintendent had found an old darklantern
he had the lantern cleaned and filled by wun sing and made ready against the nights operations
at ten oclock in the evening bremerton and ohara quietly slipped out of camp and made their way along the trail to the top of the ridge
three men were waiting for them on the the sheriff and two deputies mighty glad said ransom after a few minutes talk that something is going to be done out here
thugs and pluguglies have been doing about as they please at the mariquita and the law has had blamed little to work on
sneaking coyotes have covered theft tracks well and even when griggsby went i couldnot lay hold of the first thing in the shape of a clue
the coroners verdict that he met his death at the hands of some person or persons unknown still stands a blot on the good name of this county and this mining district but now with your help in hopes to accomplish something be a cleanup ransom declared bremerton shortly and you can gamble on that
where did you leave your horses got a buckboard back a ways on the trail
you understand the scheme
captain bryden and the halfbreed is only part of it in addition to that weve got to recover the stolen amalgam
i get you
maybe your idea will work and maybe it wonot but well try it out
all five of them pushed into the chaparral at the trailside
the night wind rustled the and as it rose and fell the muttering of the mill rose and fell with it
the clearcut stars gleamed in the sky like scattered diamonds and only beneath them the trail was a lone whitish blur and the ridgetop a shadowy stretch of brushclumps and massed boulders
an hour dragged and that whispered ransom in ear a horse and coming from the wrong direction make a move
the galloping came close and a horse and rider paused within a dozen feet of those in the chaparral
rising in the stirrups the rider looked over into the valley for a moment peering and listening then with a sharp turn to the right was off and out of sight along the ridge
a woman by thunder murmured the amazed sheriff
he swore under his breath
is there a woman mixed up in this bremerton he demanded
how do i know whos mixed up in it returned the superintendent fretfully
there are others besides big steve and chombo i suppose and maybe tonight will give us a line on them
with one hand he touched ohara
the latter was sitting comfortably his long knees hunched to his chin and his hands clasped around them
he laughed softly but said not a word
the tide of sentiment had set in toward mariquita mallory
this weakness of the girls for nightriding and at times when the nights were bedeviled with treachery had in timely fashion been brought home to ohara
bremerton expected surprise and consternation
his expectations had been met with a laugh that expressed unreasoning unshaken faith
another hour dragged and then through the deep rolling diapason of the mill a sliding foot whispered in the sand
a dark figure was climbing out of the valley a sack over the shoulder
get ready said bremerton to the sheriff
a tense moment followed
ransom took something from his pocket and rose crouching to his feet
bremerton brought the lantern around in front of him and made ready to open the shutter
the figure won to the top of the trail and turned toward the length of the ridge
in that moment the shutter clicked and an eye of light streamed from the bushes
big steve whirled with a gasp in his throat
the bag dropped and he stood blinking in the glare
then a hand swept under his coat toward his hip
none of that
the bushes crashed and ransom landed heavily in the trail got your number bryden and heres where you lose
bring that hand back in front of you
the hand came back but with steel glittering in the lanternlight
the amalgamator at bay would have made a fight of it even against such odds long body shot clear of the chaparral as though propelled by springs and with the swiftness of lightning he caught the steel and tore it away
that pulls his fangs for him remarked ohara stepping back
he has no sense at all or hed know when hes trapped this puffed big steve stoppin me
the sheriff replied that official briskly
andy
both deputies were out of the bushes by then and andy hurried to the prisoner with a pair of handcuffs
big steve showed his mettle and his desperation and began a wild fight against the inevitable
leave him to me said the fluteplayer and caught the thick hairy wrists
with a strength no one but bremerton knew he possessed ohara slowly but surely brought the hands of the prisoner together in front of him be in a rush with those comealongs andy cautioned bremerton wants his coat do you mind another one to be dealt with
the words caused big steve to remember chombo and he lifted a roar of warning
the other deputy came up behind and slapped a hand over the prisoners mouth
off with the coat said bremerton bringing the light closer
i donot think the yell caused any harm
with the sheriffs help the coat was stripped from the amalgamators shoulders and the handcuffs snapped in place
bremerton put on the coat over his flannel shirt and picked up a black slouch hat that lay in the trail
take him off to the wagon he went on the deputies
a twisted handkerchief was tied between big jaws as a precaution against any further use of his voice and the two men half dragged and half carried him along the road
ransom borrowed the lantern and turned its light into the open mouth of the sack
caught him with the goods all right
there was a throb of satisfaction in his husky voice
bremerton weve a dead open and shut so far as that fellow is concerned get the others in the same way was response only one more lee put in ohara quietly
make sure
we will make sure of it mike
bremerton stuffed his own hat in the front of his coat and put on big got to proceed carefully from now on if we locate the amalgam
he picked up the bag and threw it over his shoulder
shut off the lantern he added and follow well in the rear
wait a bit
ohara stepped closer to his friend
this is the part of your scheme bremerton that has little appeal to me
the breed may think youre bryden for a few moments but how will this play get you the location of the amalgam
if you think you can act the part of steve and get chombo to talk then youre far wide of your trail
again suppose chombo heard that yell of big if he did hell be waiting and ready for you
chombo will be in the dark of the arroyo explained bremerton
we canot hide out and wait for him as we did for steve and the three of us canot approach the mouth of the arroyo without arousing the breeds suspicions a flat to cross and practically no cover
this is the only move we can make that will lay chombo by the heels and i may get a tip regarding the amalgam
and you may get something more than you expect muttered ohara
not from chombo
he has only one good hand
well go ahead cut in the sheriff impatiently
whatever happens bremerton well be at your back
the superintendent started along the ridge
indistinct as he was in the starlight chombo might easily mistake him for steve bryden
following the route the amalgamator had taken the previous night bremerton descended the slope crossed the little plateau and paused only to give the whistle signal
the signal was answered and he advanced swiftly to the arroyos mouth
a figure disentangled itself from the gloom as the superintendent dropped the bag and seated himself on a boulder a stealthy figure that crouched forward only to halt warily and at a safe distance
steve questioned a voice
yes answered bremerton
the word was lost in a report and fire flashed in the mouth of the arroyo
bremerton gasped swayed and slowly sank downward at the side of the boulder
a wild laugh burst from chombo
his form straightened and he plunged forward
ransom and ohara could be heard stumbling across the flat coming uncertainly but at speed each with his own forebodings about bremerton
chombo bent and grabbed for the bag of amalgam
in the same instant arms went around him
thought you had me eh growled bremerton
not that time
the two were struggling when ransom and ohara came up
in short order the halfblood was flung to the ground and pinned there by the sheriff
lee asked ohara anxiously how bad is it bremerton laughed
chombo knew something was wrong he answered and some one was handily by to pick me off
but the shot went wide
och you schemer chuckled ohara mightily relieved
you dropped and the breed rushed for the sack
then you nailed him
it was well done for i thought in my soul you had followed griggsby
good work said ransom approvingly
chombo he added to his surly captive the sheriff arid youre under arrest
we have your confederate bryden
now wheres the loot making no promises but it will surely not go harder with you if you tell us about the amalgam let me go if i give ye the amalgam panted the halfblood
no
you may help yourself though if you make a clean breast of this
there was a brief silence during which chombo seemed to be thinking
get off he gasped let me breathe
you hurt my arm
ransom groped through clothes for weapons confiscated a knife and finally got to his feet
the lantern ohara said he
the yellow gleam fixed itself upon the form of chombo and undef the threatening muzzle of the sheriffs gun he struggled to his feet
you did this said chombo between his teeth
his black eyes gleaming with hate turned on bremerton
some day i am going to kill you do you came sharply from ransom
better think of yourself chombo be some years before youre footloose and able to camp on anybodys trail
what about that loot the halfblood swore softly and shifted his arm to a more comfortable position in the sling
what can i do he complained fiercely
you are three and i am only one take you where you can find the amalgam
how far is it half a mile maybe
just a minute put in bremerton
who fired that shot from the arroyo
carramba
some things i tvill not tell
that is one clear enough to me anyhow
the girl on the horse queried the sheriff
easy easy cautioned ohara
facts are what we want not guesses
he whirled on chombo and flung the light full in his evil face add a lie to the rest o your misdoings said he but tell us who shot at bremerton
cunning flashed in the shifty black eyes
senorita mallory
you spawn of the pit cried ohara
i throw it back in your teeth too ready to tell when you swore you wouldnot
the truth is not in you
if hed lie about one thing ransom hed lie about two and i would not go a step with him to find this amalgam give him a chance to make good answered the sheriff
if hes got any black scheme in his mind hell pay for it
come with me thats all said chombo surlily
if you find lyin you can make me pay playing fair observed bremerton be going
with ohara on one side of him and ransom on the other chombo led the searchers into the arroyo
for several minutes they stumbled through the darkness then climbed a steep slope traversed the length of a hogback plunged downward into blackness again and came finally into a small canon
the walls were not high and from somewhere ahead could be heard a drip drip of water falling into a pool
a turn in the gulch brought them out on a flat covered with a sparse growth of oaks
they were now close to the dripping water and a small house could be seen under the shadow of the trees
oak flats remarked ransom i know the place
the only water this side the mariquita
which way chombo the adobe barn back of the house said the prisoner
the small house was dark and still
twenty yards away backed up against the rugged gulch wall stood the barn
a corral fenced with okatea stakes braided with wire was close to the barn
as they passed the corral a horse whinnied
must be some one at home commented bremerton
if so returned ohara theyre in bed like honest folks
my word for it this halfbreed is muy nialo not be trusting him under oath
wait snarled the prisoner
he conducted them around the side of the adobe barn then kicked his foot against the base of the wall
his foot struck wood and there was a hollow resonant sound
take away that board and look hissed chombo
then tell me a liar
bremerton dropped to his knees and while the beam of light played over the base of the adobe wall he removed a square section of board
a cavity was revealed
he reached into it and fished up a ball of amalgam the size of his fist
tally one for the breed muttered ransom right bremerton hes playing fair
how much of the stuff is in the cache
with both hands bremerton began scooping out the amalgam
the heap grew into a small mountain of frosted silver before he brought out the last ball and rose to his feet
as i figure it said he the mariquita mill has been systematically robbed since the days of griggsby not a tenth of the stealings in that pile
figure some more came the sneering voice of the halfblood
would all the amalgam be left in that hole under the wall or would it be taken away when there was enough to make it worth while retorted run into bars and sold quick light footfall was heard at that moment and the men turned
ohara shifted the gleam of the lantern and the slender erect figure of mariquita mallory was etched clearly against the somber background of the oaks
she came steadily bravely on her widebrimmed hat pushed back and the rebellious tresses twisting about her forehead and throat
her face was set in resolute lines
a quirt swung from her slender wrist and her horse could be seen dimly in the distance
this is hardly a time for visitors said she
may i ask what you are doing
ohara stepped forward
with a courtly gesture he removed his hat
miss mariquita mallory he inquired in a voice as soft as any note of his flute
her large eyes swerved to him wonderingly and she inclined her head
and these are your premises the place where you live
yes
then be so kind as to bear with the lot of us
the man there and he flashed the lantern upon the prisoner has been caught takin goold from the mariquita mill
he led us here saying hed show us where hed cached some more of it
and faith he has
twas under the adobe wall
bad cess to the blackguard for hiding his loot on the property of honest folks
the girl stood like a statue
her gaze passed from ohara encountered bremerton then fell on the sheriff and finally rested on the pile of amalgam
ohara threw the light from point to point as the wide wondering eyes traveled over the oddly assorted group
that amalgam was found there under the wall the words were quick and breathless and they ended in what was almost a sob
a gloved hand arose to the white throat and the fingers closed
be sure miss mallory said ohara hastily you have nothing to fear at all
why why should i have anything to fear you know me i think miss mallory spoke up ransom with a touch of sternness the sheriff
if you can tell us anything about this halfbreed now is the time
the hand dropped from the throat and the lithe figure straightened
the head went up the shoulders back and the girl faced the sheriff squarely
has the halfbreed told you anything about me she demanded
he says you shot at bremerton from the arroyo and he man man burst wildly from ohara what was the need o that
with measured steps mariquita mallory approached chombo where he stood at side
quick as thought her right hand flew up and the quirt fell stingingly across the halfbreeds face
with bosom heaving and eyes flashing she leaped back
say it again she cried
here before me say it again
hate and rage and pain twisted villainous face
oh will you say it breathed the girl fiercely
there is no one to help mariquita mallory no one but mariquita mallory herself
a womans good namewhat is that to a prowling dog in these hills
what is it to any of you
her flaming eyes swept the faces of the nfen
does it mean nothing to me to be lied about and slandered and my name made a byword on the lips of honest men
shame to you that you listen to the wretch and doubleshame that you leave it to me to drive the lie down his miserable throat
but i can do it
she whirled back to chombo again and once more her arm went up and the quirtthongs trailed over her shoulder
was it true answer
no said the halfbreed and cowered with his good arm doubled before his face
the excitement the frenzy went out of the girl in an instant
her arm fell at her side and her body seemingly spentjjy that gust of passion drooped limply forward
mr bremerton she murmured sadly some day you will be sorry for all your suspicions some day if i can bear this long enough to make it clear to you
if that amalgam was stolen from the mariquita mill and brought here it was done for a purpose
that purpose was to bring nearer the jail with which you so gallantly threatened me that night by the town canal
this home she waved her hand about her is my home and my mud hovelthe only place we can call our own
we should have bettersome day we will have better if we get justice and can live and fight till it comes
do what you can mr bremerton she said scornfully to cheat us out of our rights but never again take the word of a halfbreed thief against mariquita mallory
a dead silence ensued when the girl had finished
ransom was dumfounded bremerton amazed and ohara humble and apologetic
it was the irishman who first ventured to speak
miss mallory what you say goes to the heart of all of us
but believe me you have not the right of it
when the halfbreed said what he did i gave him the lie
and you donot know the heart of him yet
some day as you said youll come into your rights and on that day youll know lee bremerton as i know him
a smile played about the girls full lips
you are irish she asked
all but the brogue he laughed
my father is irish and my mother was mexican and you think i didnot guess faith your name was enough to tell me that
you are a friend of mr friend that doesnot tell the half of it
he saved me in the desert and for two years we thirsted and starved together
such a life does not make for friends do you mind but for brothers
then show mr bremerton how wrong he is in his dealings with the mallorys
that is the greatest kindness you can ever do himand me
she pulled away her glove and reached out her right hand
ohara accepted it with a knightly courtesy
trust me for that he answered
mariquita once more faced the sheriff
take that amalgam away with you said she
you will find oresacks in the barn
with that she left him returned to her horse and led the animal toward the corral
they watched her until she had passed from sight
so thats old girl murmured ransom in a bewildered tone
hanged if i ever knew she had such a temper
temper countered ohara
not a bit of it spirit fine and high and nothing else
she ought to be on the stage growled bremerton shed make a hit as an emotional actress
but lets sidetrack the heroics and get away
give me the lantern ohara
ohara gave him the light without a word and he went into the adobe barn to get the oresacks
in due course dutch fred bought brought out from town and duly delivered to smear case one dozen bags of smoking tobacco
i make no holler said fred but i donot got a fair shake
whyever didnot you inquired case
dot irish feller mit der crooked eyes come around since der bet
he is a masgot for bremerton
i bet nodding against masgots
he is vat beat me oudt of dot smokin yah so
case chuckled and as he walked away loaded with tribute he added insult to injury with this gem of song it takes the irish to beat the dutch
what the irish canot accomplish it donot amount to much
with your scientific tricks you can never fool the can bet your life the irish beat the dutch
for the first time since deane had acquired the mariquita mine the property was more than paying expenses
this was a matter for congratulation although it was not going far enough
it was no showing on which to effect a sale of the mine for half a million dollars task was to bring the output of bullion up to the bonanza point set by mallory
he had unearthed a file of bullion certificates and these he had compared with assays of rock from the lead on which the miners were now at work
the ore was different
mallory had not worked out a rich pocket on the present vein
he had dug in virgin and bonanza ground
but where was it
while the camp was being reorganized and shaken down to a commercially profitable basis big steve and chombo had come to trial for the larceny of the bullion and had been sentenced to the penitentiary
between arrest and conviction a remarkably short time had intervened
and the sentences imposed were strangely inadequate sinister influences had been at work in behalf of big steve and chombo
a lawyer of prominence had managed their case but he had hastened rather than checked the laws course
as soon as his clients were finally behind the bars it was known that he had begun disbursing small sums as pensions to the immediate families of the two men
bremerton had hoped that one or both of the thieves would make a confession involving more of enemies
in this he was disappointed
they held their peace and took their medicine and bremerton felt sure that somebody had made it worth their while
indirectly it seemed certain that the convicted men were part of the strong and desperate organization that was fighting deane
with this murderous and persistent gang bremerton could not but connect the mallorys
absolute proof however was lacking
while bremerton gophered and hunted for clues of the lost vein and pestered his mind with doubts and theories in other directions ohara cheerfully tinkered with the millplates and in offhours played his flute
apparently the irishman had not a care in the world
now and then he would drop in on the night amalgamator in the small hours of the morning exchange small talk with him and covertly watch for dishonest work
but if the amalgamator on the night shift had been crooked the fate of big steve had induced him to reform
this which came nearer being a care for ohara than anything else settled itself comfortably and left nothing on his mind
in second month at the mine at the close of a monday afternoon a mexican boy rode up to the office and asked for the superintendent
bremerton was just coming in from a days fruitless quest for the lost vein and the boy handed him a note offered no explanation one way or the other and immediately galloped away
bremerton read the note and smiled queerly
after supper that evening while ohara was getting out his flute the superintendent halted the music for a talk
what are you doing to carry out your part of the agreement mike
bremerton inquired suddenly
the other looked up blankly a rolling stone i am and utterly irresponsible said he a contract to such a man
but you have me curious lee
what agreement is in your mind the one you made with mariquita mallory
you were to show me how wrong i am in my estimate of her and her father
weeks have gone and you have not made a move ohara trilled a few notes then laid the flute on his knee
sure it was an easy job and i saw it from the start makin no wrong estimates
what you say bremerton is one thing and what you believe in that case is another entirely not giving me credit for being honest giving you credit for trying hard to be loyal to deane
we might as well thrash this out mike
your attitude toward mariquita mallory is so different from mine that it bothers me
tis not different at all and the flute went to his lips while he ran the scale no use arguing with an irishman
then why are you bothered quizzing wrinkles showed around the twinkling crossed eyes
bremerton frowned and reached for a pigeonhole of his desk
removing a folded paper he handed it to ohara and asked him to read it said ohara give something handsome if such an invite could come to me
did lacey accept the note from mariquita mallory explained bremerton sharply that lured lacey into a trap
on the way to make his call he was shot from cover
only yesterday he left the phoenix hospital almost a wreck of a man to go east and get back his strength
now wasnot that the divils own luck he couldnot be shot cornin back could he not at all
he had to get it going and that robbed him of a few blessed moments with the only woman ever seen whos distinctly worth a mans time
for me now count it a pleasure to run the gantlet of a dozen ambushes just for a smile from the girl
at that moment bremerton was nearer to being out of patience with his friend than at any time since he had known him
jumping to his feet he strode up and down the office
calmly the irishman blew into the flute and out of it came softly the air of mollie it was always a favorite in his more serious moments
bremerton sat down again and waited until he had finished
ohara took his time and a smile came to his lips as he again favored his friend with his attention
your fur was standing lee he remarked and i thought it would calm you
you canot stay mad at me and you know it
let matters drift
before long youll be coming around in this mallory business something else for you to read said bremerton handing him another note
ohara took the paper and read mr bremerton you must listen to me now
you are in danger and i can help you
come to our house in the morning at eight
you will not be sorry if you do for this time trust mariquita mallory
och the luck you have when you donot deserve it commented ohara his faded eyes glowing
the poor taste she has sending for you when she might have sent for me
he sighed heavily
but a redheaded freak who canot look at a girl with both eyes at once mustnot expect too much in this world
bremerton i congratulate you
the superintendent leaned forward and stayed the hand that was reaching for the flute
cut that out for now said he sharply
do you understand this perfectly go and the girl will be getting you out of one danger only to draw you into another
for the peace of my soul rather face a battery of masked guns than come company front with those big black eyes the danger for you and known it all along talk like an idiot growled bremerton impatiently
this is a lure just as the note to lacey was a lure you see it he says that murmured ohara and calls me an idiot
my poor man he added you are not yourself one thing i can see
of course going of course you are
if for nothing more than to convince you that youre wasting a lot of sentiment on a scheming treacherous woman continued bremerton hotly
you canot take that back said ohara dryly but not say it again
with me it will go no further put the girl to the test you that will be put to the test not mariquita mallory
if an attack is made on me while riding to oak flat youll be convinced that the girl is not what she would have you think
nothing of the kind be convinced that enemies have watched their chance to catch you away from home
even two coincidences wouldnot spell the truth
be reasonable implored bremerton let your heart run away with your head
and donot you lee bremerton let the cursed plots of deane run away with your sense of right and justice
make your call
if youre shot out of your saddle and brought back here with the breath gone out of your body it will not be the girl go hunting
mark that
whom would you hunt queried the superintendent curiously
why the fiends who would cause that girl to bear the brunt of their own black deeds
lee you began your work here with a mistaken idea
you can make have seen you do it before
you went out of your way to think wrong of a woman
it comes hard for you to think it and deep down in your heart you are not convinced but money has worked its spell and youve got to do something to earn it
deane
deane the man who has built himself up by knifing his friends
he has piled high his dollars by blasting the hopes of others by backstabbing by schemes that wonot bear the light by no more of that mike talking fair to your face and hitting you with a club from behind
a robber so black that big steve and chombo are white as the saints by comparison
and he has hooked youbecause i was slow in getting around with thatthousand
can i ever forgive myself for that
the washedout blue eyes snapped the red hair seemed to stand on head and the blood rushed into the thin cheeks
the irishman half rose and shook a clenched fist at the ceiling
he saved my life once said bremerton his bronzed face almost white and he wouldnot play anything but square with me
square sneered ohara
he has forgot how to be square
when he took the wrong turn of the trail he went moneymad
play square with you
lee youre a tool
on6 of these days you will find it out and then blackguard that he is i tremble for silas deane
without speaking a word bremerton turned on his heel and strode from the office
the notes of the flute followed him through the door
ohara was right attitude toward mariquita mallory was one of distrust not of absolute conviction
at the first he was sure that the note to lacey was a part of the tragic plot against him
now he was uncertain
this second note revived his suspicions of the girls motives
it offered a chance to test her character and as such he welcomed it
if he were set upon while proceeding to the mallorys then he would know the girl for what she was
in his own mind there would be no coincidence about it
for him perhaps there was grave risk in the undertaking
he thought little of that
on an open trail in broad day he could use his eyes and his wits and lurking foes would not easily get the better of him
the mill was sounding the sixoclock whistle as he rode out of camp
the stamps clattered to a standstill and from rising ground bremerton looked back and saw the night shifts emerging from mine and mill and the day shifts straggling from bunkhouse and mexican quarter
boom
boom came muffled explosions out of the distance
they were the blasts fired by the miners so that levels and shafts might be clear of fumes before the other gang went underground
from six to seven at the beginning and the end of each day the work closed down for breakfast and supper and the changing of shifts
bremerton spurred over the top of the trail
for a quarter of a mile he would follow the main road to town then turn into a branch that led to the canon and oak flat
the rough country contiguous to the valley had been piled with monuments filed on and now belonging to deane as part of the mariquita property
bremerton had combed those adjacent uplands in his search for the lost vein and had found no blowouts or other promising indications
he believed the outlying claims comprised merely a barrier against those who would poach on the mariquita preserves
he was thinking less of that morning errand than of the mysterious bonanza ledge when he reached the point where he was to leave the main trail
an swale crossed the road and his course lay through the swale and toward the west
a road runner darted out of the bushes on the right
the horse gave a startled snort and reared backward
at the same moment a sharp report rang out on the left and bremerton felt the wind of a bullet against his face
on so small a thing may a mans life hang
the roadrunner had startled the horse and the horse had reared and at just that moment the shot had been launched from the brush
had head been inclined a foot forward deane would have been looking for another superintendent
this flashed through brain
but he had not much time for thought
the lurch of his mount had loosened the cinches and the saddle turned
he made a wild effort to keep on the horses back
finding this to he impossible as the shot had still further alarmed tfie horse and set it to plunging he tried to kick free of the stirrups and strike the ground on his feet
one foot was freed but the other became entangled
he fell heavily in the trail on his shoulders kicking desperately to get clear of the clinging stirrup
the horse frenzied by the unusual turn of events continued to rear and fling its heels
the outlook was dark indeed for bremerton then for he was in imminent danger of being trampled to death
a hoarse shout came from the chap arral
a crushing of brush was heard at hajf a dozen widely separated points
this of course was all lost upon bremerton for the more immi nent danger claimed his attention
suddenly the horse whirled to the right and ran into the swale dragging its rider over the rough ground and through the greasewood
bremerton was bumped against stones lashed with brushbranches and threatened at every leap with the pounding ironshod heels
he felt his senses going and surrounding objects slid past him in a confused blur
dimly he was aware of beating hoofs close at handnot those of his own runaway horse but others
one thought rose paramount in his befogged mind
they had him
at last those mysterious forces he had defied were closing in on theirquarry the horse stopped
some one dismounted
the next moment his released foot fell and his body lay prone upon the ground
there followed a preliminary trampling of the earth ending in a tattoo of hoofs that faded into silence along the swale
mr bremerton
he realized that his horse was gope that another horse stood quietly a few yards from where he lay and that on her knees beside him was mariquita mallory
he sat up bewildered
bring on the rest of the gang he said presently
he felt for his automatic revolver but it had been lost out of his pocket
there was nothing left with which to defend himself and he must take whatever was to come
can you get up
the girl put out her hand
with her assistance he gained his feet
where are the rest of them he demanded glaring in the direction of the trail
they are behind she answered and crowding us close
come we must hurry
crowding ns close he returned
you may not believe it she said with a trace of bitterness but they would not spare me any more than they would you have to trust me now mr bremerton and you must pull yourself together and do your best
she straightened and peered anxiously up and down the swale then she bent her head to listen
what she saw or heard was beyond bremerton but a look of wild alarm crossed her pallid face
quick she whispered and seized his arm convulsively
he yielded himself passively into her hands
whether she was a friend or foe made little difference just then
he knew his danger could not be more acute either way
leaving her horse mariquita pulled him toward the bank of the swale
there she dropped to her knees and began climbing through the thick brush
the quirt trailing from her wrist by a leather loop got in her way
she jerked it from her arm and flung it aside
he followed her on all fours up and up through the mask of the chaparral
his brain was clearing andhe wondered why she had abandoned her horsewhy they had not both mounted the animal and galloped away
if she was really trying to befriend him that would have seemed like the safest course
he could not hear a sound in the depths of the scrub behind them
what had become of the man who had fired at him at the fork of the trail perhaps the murderous scoundrel had been frightened away by the failure of his plans perhaps the girl was being carried away by her fearsshe was a woman and he had not much faith in a womans resourcefulness at such a time
in spite of his doubts however he made no protest
on hands and knees he crawled after the girl to the top of the bank
he would have spoken then but she looked at him wildly and placed a finger on her lips
he started to rise but she pulled him down
crack
from somewhere in the swale came the bark of a firearm
a bullet snapped through the bushes
the golden echoes had hardly died into silence before they were taken up by another report
this came from farther up the swale but the snarling lead struck at the same point that had drawn the first shot
then again and again from widely varying locations below bullets were hurled at that one spot on the top of the bank
the girls face was white and yet she seemed to have herself well in hand nothing else for it she whispered through tense lips more to herself than to bremerton we must take to the blind our only chance
she turned and once more began worming her way onward
at a distance of fifty feet the ground broke abruptly into a sheer descent ahead of them
they looked into a narrow steepwalled gully
bremerton had seen that gully before
on the opposite side outlying holdings embraced the upanddown wall and the last monument of the mariquita property was heaped at the walls base got to get down there mr bremerton declared the girl
i can do it he answered but you i can go wherever you can let that worry you have us bottled up once were in the gully
i know the place and its a veritable cul de sac
we can get into it here but we canot get out once were down there they can take their time picking us off
no and she spoke with an effort i know something about this that you donot
she began letting herself over the rim
wait he interposed go first and help you
after being dragged by your horse as you were you may have all you can do to help yourself all over that he answered and lowered himself to a protruding stone in the cliffs face
come after me closely he added used to this rockclimbing
foot by foot they descended a projecting rock here or a weatherworn seam in the wall there affording them treacherous rounds in the cliff ladder
the girl was clearheaded and steady and at this bremerton marveled
surely he had known very little about her up to that moment
time after time he reached upward to place the small foot in a place of comparative safety and occasionally he lifted his voice in warning where the handholds were weak or the footholds crumbling
when they neared the foot of the wall lead once more began to fly
the marksmen kept themselves in hiding dropshooting from an angle that made their work more unnerving than dangerous
bullets struck against granite and glanced singing into space
a few ranged upward and inward and one spent ball passed through sleeve
now where asked bremerton as he and the girl stood side by side at the foot of the wall
his voice was even almost colorless strained glance rested on his face curiously
you are a good deal of a man mr some things said she
this is no time for foolish talk he answered sharply
nor for foolish actions perhaps such as the one i am about to do
this way and be quick
she ran across the boulderstrewn bed of the gully and gained a screen of chaparral on the other side
he followed
the firing strangely enough had slackened and the dash was entirely successful
come in here called the girl from a granite overhang
he stepped under the rock
in the half gloom a hand reached his and led him on and on into blank darkness
as he stumbled forward he reached out with his free hand and ran it gropingly over a ragged wall
wonder gripped him
they were in a tunnel
hard on the heels of wonder came a flash of hope and exultation
a womans sacrifice
who ran this tunnel into the gully wall miss mallory
bremerton in his excitement over this new discovery forgot the dangers that had driven them into that subterranean refuge
his voice rang joyfully between the narrow walls and the girl must have realized the trend of his thoughts
my father and she answered quietly dug and blasted our way into the heart of the hill ground
this is the lost vein the bonanza ledge been hunting for
i had an idea all the time that you and your father knew where it wasthat you must know where it was
what did you do with the waste you took out of the bore
no one could look into the gully and even suspect that mining operations had been going on
why did you mask the work
why have you made a secret of it
she had dropped his hand
almost fiercely her voice leaped at him i had to bring you here in order to save your life
are you going to take advantage of the sacrifice and wreck the mallorys completely carruthers knew nothing about this vein
i found it
our only weapon against deane all we could use in defending our rights has been this secret of the hills
are you going to turn that weapon against ns
under the torrent of those hot words something like shame rose in his breast
she had saved his life at the expense of a golden secret carefully guarded
was he more indebted to her who had rescued him than to deane his employer
mariquita interpreted his silence as favoring her interests and her fathers
her voice lost some of its sharpness as she went on
we are safe here
the wretches in the gully will not show themselvesthey never do
they plot and kill from cover
once seen they could be run to earth identified and made to suffer from what they have done and are doing
eager as they are to destroy you mr bremerton they are more eager to keep themselves out of any entanglement with the law
they know how hard the law would deal with them on account
just a moment
there are candles and matches here and i want you to see everything and to know everything
i think you will listen to me now
he could hear her moving around near the opposite wall
presently she came back to him
a light might be seen from the overhang said she so we will not make one until we round the angle of the wall a little way ahead
come
she took his hand as before and led him forward and around a sharp turn
half a dozen steps farther and they halted again
first mariquita observed let me tell you how i happened to be in the swale
i donot have to tell you what happened to latey in answering a similar note of mine
you thought evil of me in that matter
it was in my mind this morning knew you were threatened and that a blow might fall while you were on the way to the canon
but i had to ask you to come to me for you had made it impossible for me to come to the mine
i was anxious to learn whether you had faith enough in me whether your friend could persuade youto answer that note in person
i didnot need persuasions he broke in grimly for i should have come anyway
i wanted to test youto find out whether a move would be made against me as it had been made against lacey in the same situation
so when that shot was fired at the fork in the trail you considered the case against me proven
i had no time to consider anything
the saddle turned and i dropped in the road
but never mind that miss mallory
go on
i had been watching the gang as well as i could and i knew they were watching you and only waiting for a chance to catch you off your guard
since you sent big steve and chombo to prison your skulking foes have been hot for reprisal
they realized that i was trying to help you and they would have blackened my motives in your eyes if they could
chombo tried it that night you found the amalgam
the stuff was hidden in that place so that if discovered you could not but think ill of the mallorys
her voice caught in her throat and her quick breathing there in the underground quiet smote on his ears
i was anxious about you mr bremerton she resumed steadying herself for i realized only too well what you would think if anything went wrong on your way to the canon
i rode to the swale by a roundabout bourse and was waiting for you to borne
i saw what happened
as your horse charged past me dragging you by a stirrup i turned my own horse and followed
the thing i did not expect but feared in my heart had come to pass
if you had been killed your friend ohara would have blamed me but if i could do something to save you then you and ohara would be compelled to believe in me
that is why i stopped your horse and that is why i made the sacrifice in bringing you here
you wrong ohara
nothing could make him suspect you of treachery
he hasnot the same responsibility at the mine that i have bremerton added dryly
it wasnot my life particularly but your own good name that concerned you think that
deane has robbed us and all we hoped was to effect some settlement withhim on the score of his lost vein
but he has no heart no conscience
the more he was harrassed and the harder the work at the mine was made for him the nearer he might be forced to a compromise with us
but the slaying the shooting the robbingoh in the name of justice do not connect my father and me with that
who has done it all others
i donot know who they are and i donot know the motives back of it for they work in the dark
if you could discover who is paying the relatives of big steve and chombo a pension you would get a clue that might help unravel the mystery not go into that now
my father and i are not to be identified with those wretches
you are to make sure of that once and for all
my father knew you were coming to phoenix
we went to town as soon as we heard and he followed you about and took the first opportunity to warn you
no work was going on at the mariquita mine and i think i cannot be positivethat there were some from there concerned in that attack on you by the town canal
remembering the ball of amalgam and how it had ultimately led to the unmasking of big steve bremerton made no doubt that the girl was right
the conclusion was interesting but led to no substantial results
my father after he left you that night in phoenix the girl pursued heard the rush of men among the cottonwoods
oh the pity that the attack should have happened then of all times so that blame could be laid at my fathers door
he came at once and told me and i rode to the canal to see how matters had fared with you
for my trouble i had only hard words and cruel suspicion
that is what hurts a womansome women hurt me
i wanted you to understand the situation mr bremerton and i smothered my pride and rode to the mine for a talk with you
it would have been better if i had stayed away
under the strain of all this wrong and injustice my fathers health is breaking
he has fought for years with misfortune and just at the moment when success was within his grasp it was snatched away by deane treacherously deliberately cruelly
if he had done what he should that night in phoenix father would have sent the police to the town canal
but he was not himself and when he had brought word to me it was too late soon as we came back home from town i began trying to learn something about these others who are fighting deane
night after night i have hovered about the mine
i saw big steve go to thtf arroyo and meet chombo but i could not follow chombo and find what he did with the amalgam
the night of the capture i was close to chombo when the shot was fired at you
i could not see the man who fired but i heard him scrambling away
i took after him but he evaded me in the pitchy darkness of the arroyo
when i got back to oak flat i found you there and ohara and the sheriff
can you put yourself in my place and realize how i felt to hear from the sheriff that chombo accused me of shooting at you
i had just worn myself out trying to run down that skulking cowardly scoundrel
a feeling of sympathy for the girl had grown in breast as she talked
he was glad of the dark and that he could not see her face
had there been anything more to impress him in her favor his sense of duty toward deane would surely have suffered
no doubt i have been mistaken said bremerton slowly
after my interview with lacey though the mistake was natural
i am willing to set aside our past differences miss mallory and we can make common cause against these prowling devils who shoot from ambush and rob and work under cover
do you want it that way what will be the end of our work she asked doubtfully
we will drive them out he answered resolutely and bring to punishment those who murdered griggsby and sent lacey to the hospital
but apart from that she persisted
why with the bonanza vein to draw on for ore i will equal the showing you and your father made at the mariquita
deane will unload the property for half a million and and she cut in icily you will receive five hundred dollars a month for your work and a bonus of ten thousand dollars
the half million belongs by right to my father and me
it goes to deane and we getwhat bremerton had no answer for that
his knowledge stopped short of the mallorys and their socalled rights
deane was his friend his employer
when bremerton gave his word about anything it as as good as his bond
you have nothing to say murmured mariquita
now that you have listened so far mr bremerton you must hear the rest of it
first though it will be well to go to the overhang and reconnoiter
i do not imagine that the men in the gully have the slightest idea what has become of us but it is just as well to be on the safe side
if you will wait here for a few minutes do the reconnoitering he cut in and groped his way back around the turn and to the mouth of the tunnel
at the lip of the overhang he could hear the distant growling of the stampmill
it was faint however and if there had been any stirring about in the gully he would have been aware of it
it was impossible for him either to see or to hear anything of his mysterious enemies
when he returned he found that the girl had lighted a candle
the light fell over her face bringing out and accentuating each softly molded line
her large eyes met his wistfully appealingly as she put the candle in his hand and pointed to the breast of the level
there she whispered
look at the veinthe one i foundthe one my father and i developedthe ledge that makes the mariquita mine worth half a million
examine it mr bremerton
he walked to the breast brushed his hand over the surface of the rocks held the candle close and bent forward
another moment and he staggered back astounded scarcely breathing
he knewnone betterthe full worth of what he saw
prospecting was his trade and often he had hornspooned samples of crushed ore and found values that would have turned many a mans head
but never had he seen anything to compare with the indications of that bonanza lead
a rich said mariquita passively
rich he gasped
well its the richest thing this side of the comstock lode
and the veins a foot wide and a true fissure
such veins increase in values as you go down on them
what will the assays be a hundred feet or a thousand feet below aa words failed him
his voice trailed off into wondering silence not much outcropping on top of the hill she said her even tones contrasting queerly with his hoarse vehement words
i picked up just one insignificant piece of float and trailed the clue until i had uncovered a mere stringer
but that stringer was so rich that father and i covered up the opening and obliterated every sign of mineral
every man at the mine was discharged and not one suspected a strike
i guess we were wrong in doing that
the theory was correct but it did not work out well
i worked side by side with father digging that tunnel
we were months at it and we guarded every move we made
the waste from the tunnel we pitched into a hole beside the overhang and covered it with brush
when we began to take out ore we hauled it in sacks up the side of the gully
father fired and ran the engine at the mill and i stood over the plates dosing them with quick run a day then have a cleanup and spend a week getting out more ore hardly believe mr bremerton the way the amalgam ridged itself up on those plates
the gold tumbled out of the sieves and banked up so high in front of the batteryboxes that wehad to scrape it away every halfhour
father was like a boy
twenty years dropped from his shoulders
he skipped back and forth between the engineroom and the batteries and every once in a while he would stop to pat me on the shoulder and laugh girl were made
a palace and all the big things in life for you way out there in the east
at last so help me the
mallorys are coming into their own
but he was too quick with his hurrahs
we had spent so much time ion the tunnel that we couldnot mine and mill enough ore to pay for the property
into the mild depths of her eyes came a swift change
she clutched her hands and wrung them convulsively
ah the sorry way luck turned for us she whispered
with more than enough gold in sight to pay carruthers a thousand times over we had to go to deane for a paltry twenty thousand dollars
he put us off played fast and loose with us until finally he had the mine and we were worse off than nothing
her eyes snapped fire and her hands fell at her sides and clenched fiercely
a blackerhearted scoundrel never lived than silas deane
bremerton had been given time to calm himself
he studied the flame of the candle for a moment then fixed the candle on a ledge in drippings of its own grease
you are to tell me all about that now said he
why not sit down and be comfortable not a comfortable subjectfor me she answered standing in front of him as he dropped on a boulder by the hanging wall getting ahead of my 6tory too and starting at the middle where i should have gone back to the beginning
it was not always the mariquita mine mr bremerton
when carruthers found it and consolidated the several claims it was known as the apache
carruthers built the mill and laid the pipeline and opened up the vein you are now working on
you have already discovered that the vein is very ordinary and leaves no more than a small margin of profit
it looked pretty good to father and me though
an uncle in the east had died and left me two thousand dollars
one christmas day father took over the property at twentyfive thousand dollars
carruthers was to have my two thousand dollars down and three thousand dollars more the first year
then on the next christmas was at noon the time expiredif the remaining twenty thousand dollars was not paid the mine was to revert at once to carruthers a mining man and you know how such deals go
we paid expenses and by careful planning got out of the old vein enough more to give carruthers his five thousand and complete the first payment
then in midsummer i discovered the new lead told you about that
father and i were afraid that he knew what we had found would discover some way to void his contract
if we had been less suspicious and had kept some of the men to help run in the tunnel we could have taken out and milled ten times more than we needed to pay carruthers
but we were afraid of him
for that reason we did the work ourselves and kept our golden secret locked up in our own hearts
early december came and we had nothing for carruthers
then in an unlucky moment father thought of deane
mariquita paused fought down her rising emotion and presently continued
father had a passing acquaintance with thisthis mining king as they call him
he believed that we could go to denver show deane our bullion certificates and get from him as much money as we needed in exchange for a tenth interest in the property
so we went to denver was more than friendlythat is always his way told when hes planning deviltry
he listened to father took his bullion certificates verified them in course of a week and then asked how we could make such a good showing with a tenstamp mill on tendollar rock
father did not let him into our secret but told him pointblank that after the got the claim hard and fast and he was in for a tenth interest he would be given further light take care of you mallory said deane
those were his very words mr bremerton take care of you mallory and donot you lose any sleep
day after day he put us off reassuring us luring us on with false hopes until the 25th of december came
carruthers was in denver at the time
we surprised him once with deane on one of our many trips to office
oh we were blind blind not to have suspected trickery
but father had faith in deane up till ten oclock that last day
jthe girls voice quivered in her throat it was then that deane threw off his mask and curtly told father he had ho money for him and that he would have to look elsewhere for it
look elsewhere
where could we look
we knew no one in denver but deane and carruthers
i thought father would go crazy
he grabbed deane by the throat and i believe he would have killed him if i hadnot interfered
some clerks came and threw father out of that gilded den of crookedness and we spent hours trying to get the money for carruthers
the girl choked and walked up and down the level for a few moments to get control of herself
meanwhile she finished carruthers had transferred the mariquita mine to deane for fifty thousand dollars
do you know what this friend of yours did
her eyes flamed and she leaned toward bremerton with her face set and strained and her breath coming in short labored gasps
this friend of yours this man who hired you to come down here and make a showing with the mine that would enable him to sell it for half a million this mean falsehearted scoundrel had been browbeating carruthers all the while he had been feeding my father with hopes and promises
he told carruthers that the mariquita mine was enormously rich and he declared that if carruthers would not give him an option on it for fifty thousand dollars he would give my father the money to get it for half that sum
carruthers could take his choice
so far as carruthers is concerned i do not think he was much better than deane
it was the case of two rogues plucking an honest old man
carruthers must have squirmed
for him it was either let the mine go to father or to deane a mine worth half a million and for which the best he could get was a paltry fifty thousand
there were high words in that fine office but deane had to give in
father and i came back to phoenix and all we had in the world were a few tools a few head of horsesand the secret of that rich vein
so long as that new vein could not be discovered the mariquita mine was worth little
already our work in the gully had been well hidden but we went by night and made the hiding more secure
poor griggsby hunted until he was worn out and lacey too searched high and low
but neither of them suspected the wall of that of containing mineral
and you had no better luck mr bremerton
there are absolutely no mineral indications in or around the gully
the original claim there was only an outpost for the mariquita property anyway
sadness almost despair crept into her voice as she proceeded father and i went back to our little ranch in the canon
we watched the developments over in the valley
we wanted the superintendents deane sent out here to fail and we lived in hopes that deane would at last be forced to come to us and give us a half interest in the property for telling him what we knew
after a time we discovered that other and secret enemies were fighting deane hampering his operations in every conceivable way and seeking to drive him out of the district
night after night while griggsby was here the pipeline was cut thieving must have been going on in the mill too for the bullion output was barely enough for expenses the mill was set on fire and barely saved there was discontent among the men then on top of all this griggsby worried about the lost vein and his inability to make good
finally and the girl shivered he paid the penalty for helping deane
lacey was sent down
he was energetic and able and he ruled with an iron hand
but he was not successful
his best men left for the mariquita mine was getting an evil name on account of griggsby
he had to hire the riffraff of the district in order to do any work at all and that move brought its own troubles
father and while all these other enemies of were at work watched and hoped
would deane give up
would he come to us
father heard of a plot against lacey
we were both sick of the shooting and the bloodshed hard though our thoughts were toward that master schemer in denver
i sent lacey a note and asked him to come to our ranch and hear some important news
he had distrusted us all along
for all that though he started to come to us and and those others seized that as their chance to strike
afterward you appeared
some one in denver a man in officeinformed us about that
you know what we have done and tried to do since you reached the mine mr bremerton
this lost lead has been our only weapon in a hard hopeless onesided fight against a powerful and influential man
now sob rushed to lips as she said it you know our secret
ought i to have let you die rather than bring you here
are wemy father and to any consideration at your hands
i have told you the truth
are you for us or against us
there in the dimly lighted level her face and manner grew all appealing
with tears running down her cheeks she reached out her hands in mute supplication eyes wandered to the breast of the level to that footwide streak of bonanza ore which the girl and her father by the hardest kind of labor had laid bare
the superintendents gaze returned to the slender beseeching form and tearstained face in front of him
he got slowly to his feet
i shall prove what you say miss mallory he answered then in a husky unnatural voice and if it is true as god hears me i will see that you get your rights
but you must waityou must be patientyou must have confidence in me and no no not that
before he could draw back she had flung herself on her knees at his feet caught one of his hands and pressed it to her lips ohara goes gunning bremerton had not been gone an hour from the mine when king wildly excited came running to ohara
the irishman had just climbed to the ore platform on his way into the mill and the sharp cries of king brought him to a quick aboutface to pay demanded ohara startled by the look and manner of the cyanid expert horse has come back ohara and with an empty saddle
when was this just now just this minute
i ran from the corral to find you got him ohara
by george theyve got him
ohara took the pipe from his teeth and knocked out the ashes against the side of the mill
his thick eyebrows lowered over the crisscross eyes and his big thinlipped mouth twisted but with no attempt at speech
with one hand he groped in his pocket for his tobaccosack
with deliberation he filled the bowl put away the sack and scratched a match
do you hear piped king failing to understand why he had not created a sensation horse has come back and never you mind cut in ohara in his softest tones its my business and not yours and be seeing to it
go to the bunkhouse and get winchester
fetch it to the corral after makin sure there are loads in it
why shillyshally
this is no time for whys
on the jump now
ohara thrust his head through the opening that led to the oreloft and shouted for giles
the battery man came bounding up the steps
giles called away said ohara and until i come back youll be doin the amalgamating along with the rest of it
sure a cracked shoe in no battery
keep your eye on it
i will struck another match trailed it over his pipebowl and jumped from the ore platform
the pipe was going under forced draft as he hurried in the direction of the corral horse still restive stood with the looped reins thrown over a corralpost
the saddle swung underneath the stirrups resting on the ground
not so bad maybe muttered ohara
the saddle turned with him and its possible hes had no more than a spill
whoa basham he added stepping to the horse and beginning to readjust the ridinggear
by the time king reached the corral ohara had the reins off the post and was mounted and waiting loaded the little expert fluttered handing the gun to ohara
good enough not going alone to look for bremerton
not
watch me
keep a still tongue between your teeth king and look after the work be back when i get here
he dug in with his heels
the excited horse snorted and reared and then was off like an arrow along the trail
king watched the long body humped over the saddle horn until horse and rider had vanished over the rise
the mill began to pound and the pounding gradually merged into a long continuous roar
the expert tossed his hands helplessly and apprehensively and turned back toward the office the beginning of the end he muttered but hanged if i stay here while some one else comes to take place had enough of this goodness knows thoughts were busy
it was clear bremerton had not gone far before the saddle turned with himthe riderless horse had been too quick in getting back to the mine
no doubt it was this side of the canon that bremerton had taken his fall
as soon as he was over the side of the hill ohara pulled the horse down to a slower pace
his eyes focused on the trail and keenly watched it as he proceeded
the dust was fetlock deep and he knew it would show signs
he found what he was looking for near the place where the trail forked
the marks were as clear as words in an open book
first there was a clutter of hoofprints
running through them was a broad streak as though a heavy bag had been dragged at the end of a rope
then too the horse pricked up its ears and seemed to have fears in that particular place face hardened
begorrv he murmured its worse than i thought
lee was thrown and dragged straight into the swale if the marks donot lie ajid this mount on is the one that snaked him along
how did he get loose
and if he got loose and is all right why donot i meet him
i wonder if going to see something in that swale that i donot want to see
the horse trembled and did not want to go into the swale
ohara forced the animal and as they moved along the bushes gave mute evidence of progress through them
near the spot where the torn and disordered chaparral ceased to show further signs ohara found a horse patiently standing with the reins drooping from the bitrings
unless the irishman was greatly mistaken that waiting horse belonged to mariquita mallory
at once his mind was flooded with puzzling questions
guess as hard as he would however he could make nothing of that odd situation there in the swale
dropping the reins of his own mount he slid to the ground and began beating up the brush
he found nothing at all and this was a sort of negative satisfaction
just as he had about finished his searching a dull report clashed on his ears a bit of lead whispered and the brim of his hat twitched
so thats the way of it he exclaimed and let go with the winchester from the hip
his ears were keen even if his eyesight could not serve and a heavy slug whistled toward the point from which the shot had been fired at him
a cry broke from the depths of the brush
ohara located the point on the swale bank and hastened toward it
when as near as he could judge he came to the spot he saw no one
save for the murmuring of the stampmill the swale was steeped in deathly silence
faith this is a brain twister muttered ohara rearing head and shoulders above the bushes and peering about him
show yourselves you imps of the old nick he cried
or come again with a shot so i may be after locatin you
his invitation was not accepted
no form materialized out of the depths of the chaparral and there was no more firing
now what would you think of that soliloquized the irishman removing his hat and surveying the hole through the brim
sure i touched up the omadhoun that gave me the souvenir but where in the name of the saints is he whisht he added abruptly listening
he heard something
whatever it was it was feeble and the faint murmuring of the mill almost drowned it
clapping the hat on his head he proceeded on over the swalebank pausing and straining his ears at every other step
his course brought him to the brink of the gully
his gaze running along the abrupt break in the earth rested wonderingly on the end of a rope
the rope was tied to a scraggy ironwood growing near the brink and was hanging over the cliffs face
ohara laid aside the gun dropped to his knees and looked downward
then he gave an exclamation
near the bottom of the swinging rope a yard from the base of the wall lay the motionless form of a man
but it was not bremerton no not bremerton
ohara breathed again
is it the blackguard who shot at me thought the irishman
did my bullet drop him over the edge or was he going down the rope and did he fall
it was a matter for immediate investigation
ohara went to the ironwood sat down with his heels over space twisted his long legs in the rope took the winchester under his arm and began to slide
hampered with the gun he made awkward work of it but reached the foot of the wall safely
the prostrate form lying limply and with arms thrown wide from the shoulders proved to be a man whom ohara had never seen before
his hat lay at a little distance and his hair was dark and streaked with gray
a stubble of beard covered his cheeks and chin
his eyes were closed
he was plainly unconscious although a groan was now and then wrenched from his tense lips
no shot of mine touched him muttered ohara after an examination
he fell from the wall and thats the whole of it
was he or was he not the fellow who cut loose at me with that bullet
and how in the fiends name is he mixed up with bremerton and mariquita mallory
sure staggered with what i know and donot know
the clothing of the injured man was rather better than that usually worn by miners
a mexican carvedleather band was around his hat and at his waist was a belt with a holster and a heavy navy revolver
his hands although browned from exposure gave no evidence of hard labor
here was a mystery and ohara hated mysteries
yet he was compelled to grapple with this one for it seemed to bear directly upon what had happened to bremerton
he tried to arouse the stranger for a few words from him would go far toward clearing up the situation
his efforts failed and he rose to his feet in perplexity
while he stood there cudgeling his brain he was electrified by a shout from across the gully
whirling on the instant he was amazed and overjoyed to see bremerton coming toward him
and behind bremerton was miss mallory
he advanced to meet them hat was gone and his clothes were dusty and tom and in much disorder
all the indications pointed to a desperate experience of some sort on his part
the sight o you does my eyes good bremerton cried ohara
i was not expecting to find you with your feet under you but down and out somewhere in the scrub
your horse came back to the mine without you and the saddle in such shape that i knew you had had a spill
troth man but glad things are no worse
miss mallory and he smiled and doffed his hat seeing you is a surprise and a pleasure
i found your horse in the swale though so i ought not to be surprised
miss mallory saved my life began bremerton and och the luck you have smiled the irishman not that your life is saved do you mind but that miss mallory saved it for you
but if theres saving to do she is the kind to be depended upon
now can you tell me who is the man at the foot of the wall ohara turned and pointed toward the crumpled heap of humanity
the girl stared smothered an exclamation of horror then ran forward
when bremerton and ohara came to her side she turned a white face to them
stranger to me commented bremerton
is he to you
miss mallory no she answered in a strained voice
i have seen the man several times mr bremerton
her eyes wandered to the rope followed it down and rested again on the sprawledout form
he is dave carruthers she added
a carruthers
to ohara that name meant little
to bremerton and the girl time and place considered it was deeply significant glance sought face and he read there areflection of his own thoughts
here was wily and implacable foe
here was the man who bullied into selling the mine for a tithe of its value had striven to regain by lawless methods what he had lost by legal sharp practise
he had fallen from the rope while lowering himself into the gully
there seemed no doubt of that
a hard fate had finally unmasked him
bremerton knelt and made a hasty examination
he got up shaking his head ominously
if i am any judge he is close to the end of his trail said he
miss mallory and i heard shooting ohara he went on
were you concerned in it ohara explained
he fell from the rope hazarded bremerton and those with him were frightened away
i think the way is clear for us now
we must get carruthers to the mine
if possible he must be revived so he can talk
miss mallory you can climb out of here by means of the rope yes she answered and started toward the wall
wait please interposed bremerton
ohara should go first with the rifle
that will guard against possible surprises
if the horses afe still there ohara when i am ready here you can hitch the upper end of the rope to a saddle
the irishman nodded and climbed the rope readily enough
bremerton tied the gun to the dangling end and it was drawn rapidly upward
when the rope was thrown down again mariquita made the ascent watched anxiously by bremerton
there was no call for anxiety
with strength and skill the girl drew herself from crevice to projecting stone the full length of the wall and was helped over the brink by ohara
bremerton then dragged carruthers closer to the wall tied the rope snugly under his arms and called to ohara to hoist away
the limp twisting body rose gruesomely in the air and mariquita caught it at the top of the wall and by main strength drew it over the ledge
finally the rope was thrown back to bremerton and he won to the crest with little difficulty
both horses were in the swale
get into the saddle mike said bremerton lift carruthers up to you and you can support him in front of you for the little distance we have to go walk
he turned to the girl while ohara was mounting
miss mallory he went on will you ride to phoenix and send out a doctor and the sheriff
i want to do anythingeverything can she answered
this is all we can do now
remember what i told you he finished earnestly and whatever happens do not doubt me
there was a pathetic curve to her lips as she looked at him trustingly and smiled
i could not leave the fortunes of the mallory in better hands mr bremerton said she and hurried away to her horse
she was away at speed while bremerton and ohara were attending to carruthers
it was a slow journey they had back to the mine but they reached their destination and had the injured man in bed long before the noon whistle sounded from the mill
neither bremerton nor ohara had done any talking on the return journey
king who hurried to the office did enough talking for half a dozen
carruthers
what in goodness name was the matter with him
what had happened to bremerton
was he rescued by ohara
the superintendent wearily parried the experts questions
all in due time king said he youll know everything sent for a doctor
just now though you might help ohara try to bring carruthers around got to fix up a little
bremerton attended to his bruises and scratches and went through with his fixing up
when he had finished carruthers was no nearer consciousness than he had been before obstinate about getting back to earth ohara reported
faith its a doctors job or the undertakers and well have to wait
why did you send for the sheriff lee important for him to be here in case carruthers revives and has anything to say got me guessing
why the importance
king had gone his wondering way
bremerton and ohara sat by the bed watching the injured man closely
it was high time ohara understood the drift of affairs and bremerton gave him his full confidence
the struggle mariquita and her father had gone through with deane treachery to them and his covert bullying of carruthers were bluntly stated
an angry red rushed into the face and hieyes gleamed as he listened
you got all that from lips that couldnot lie he exclaimed when his friend finished
what have you to say to it
i want more proof that deane is the unscrupulous devil the girl has painted him
oh but you can strain at a point
where are you to get this proof bremerton nodded toward carruthers furnish it
if hes ever able to talk he may nothing certain
then get the proof from deane
how in my own way said bremerton gazing out of the window
ohara hoisted around in his chair and peered at his friend through narrowing eyes
and if you get this proof he queried what will you do throw a thousand dollars of dirty money in his face snapped bremerton
that much he has paid me and you have made it possible to give it back
then go further by heaven and see that the mallorys get what theyre entitled to
fine exclaimed ohara
glory be tis the finest thing in life to see a good man get right with himself
i knew it would come
you can throw the money in face if you will although i doubt the sense of that but youll never get the mallorys their rights
deane has gone to school for his bunco games and you donot know your a abs about the dirty work
lock horns with him on that point bremerton and both you and the mallorys will get the worst of it
the mill whistle blew
the clamor of the stamps died to silence and a general movement set in toward the chuckshanty
bremerton remained with carruthers while ohara went for his meal then ohara relieved bremerton
when the latter returned to the office he was surprised to find the irishman with the contents of pockets on a table in front of him
when youre looking for evidence explained ohara personal belongings are common property
now heres this solidframed fortyfivecaliber colt
three empty shells in the cylinder
one load just missed you at the fork of the trail thanks to the roadrunner another raked the bushes while you and mariquita were getting out of the swale the other maybe put that hole in my hat guesswork mike returned bremerton
close to the mark though
if you ask for a motive isnot there a good one to tack onto carruthers
when rogues fall out the divil gets his dues a watch with a nugget fob
the hands quit telling the time at seven twentyfive when he dropped
and heres a notebook with interesting readin lee
ohara picked up a small memorandumbook and turned the leaves
listen to this will you
to pennyworth on account of bryden and the halfbreed pennyworth bremerton pricked up his ears
pennyworth is the lawyer who had charge of big and fight in court said he
is there anything more not a scrap and this must have got in by mistake
now you know who financed the defense for those blackguards and whos paying pensions for hushmoney
i guess this is proof enough even if carruthers is never able to speak a word
bremerton went out into the other room and for a whole hour tramped the floor
ohara knew that his loyalty for deane was dying hard
at the end of the hour an automobile dashed up to the headquarters adobe and the doctor and the sheriff sprang out
dr morton bremerton said ransom
what does all this mean find your man in there doctor observed the superintendent nodding toward the bedroom
we have dave carruthers and hes badly hurt and unable totalk know more about what it all means if we can get some information from him
carruthers
he has always been a wildcatter and none too strong on the moral points
ransom took off his hat and knocked the dust out of it
he slipped out of sight a few months ago and i thought he had left the country
was heshot no
there was a rope over a cliff and he was found unconscious at the lower end of it
bremerton was in for some more explaining but he was tactful and said nothing about the overhang the lost vein or account of her fathers dealings with deane
the superintendents recital hinged upon the shooting at the fork of the trail his accident the rescue by the girl and the coming of ohara
the sheriff muttered an exclamation and thumped a fist into his palm
by gorry were on the track at last he declared
carruthers and not the mallorys has been picking this bone with deane
mallory isnot the one to hide out and go sniping for this mines superintendents
but carruthers could do it without the flicker of an eyelash getting down to cases now
bremerton got the notebook and showed ransom the entry regarding money paid to pennyworth on account of big steve and chombo
that cinches it averred the sheriff
he was back of that crowd and he wouldnot separate himself from good money without a reason
dr morton came out of the bedroom
he had shed his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeves the word morton queried ransom done for was the reply
mangled as he is i canot understand how he has lived as long as this
will he recover consciousness
do you think ohara showed himself suddenly at the bedroom door and beckoned
the doctor hurriedly returned to carruthers and bremerton and ransom followed
the eyes of the injured man were wide open
after wandering from face to face they came to a rest on the sheriffs too late
ransom said carruthers faintly fooled you for months and now off on the long trail and fooling you for good
bremerton was more than i bargained for and yet came within one of getting him
he the voice failed
while ohara lifted head the doctor picked up a glass from the table and put it to his lips
get a pencil and paper bremerton said ransom and take this down strength rallied under the stimulant
there was that in his eyes however which told the others unmistakably it could not be for long
he began to talk as soon as had laid him down and it was all around the few points which the sheriff wished to have made clear
i feel as though there wasnot a whole bone in my body moaned carruthers
why couldnot i go out without realizin what had happened
what did you bring me back for when i was slippin away so easy now the black horror is gripping me by the throat scared of it men scared of it
i ainot old thats all
and here crossin the divide with the best of my life ahead of me seized him
his face hardened like stone and his dull eyes smoldered
clenching his fists he broke into gasping torrents of words whose import sickened those who listened
ransom laid a muffling hand over his mouth
in name carruthers said he remember where you are
you havenot long to stay pass out with curses on your lips
let your final act go toward undoing some of the wrong
he bent down so that he could look in the feverish eyes
tell me about griggsby he added why youre here eh snarled carruthers
well you might have saved yourself the trouble
not a word about anything
i fought for my own against that blackhearted deane won and lost barter my soul for one year more of lifejust a year
he fell to raving again
ohara got up and passed into the other room
returning softly with the flute he sat down by the head of the bed and began to play
it was the intermezzo from cavalleria rusticana
never had bremerton heard ohara play as he played then
the tender melody floated about the room and there went with it a rustling as of unseen wings
ransom stood like a man entranced
morton pulled down his sleeves and walked to the window
bremerton bowed over his pencil and paper weirdly thrilled by the pathos and the pleading of those whispering notes
the twisted lines straightened in face
he fell silent
presently his eyes closed and he lay still
ohara made an end of the music and laid the flute on his knees
god breathed carruthers opening his eyes heard that before somewhere
what piece was that
only a bit of an air to make you see things differently said ohara
it does that for me and by the same token i thought it might for you
for a second carruthers lay thinking
then he turned his head so he could look at the irishman
play it again he begged
sure and as long as you please but not till youve talked with ransom
i want to know about griggsby carruthers spoke up the sheriff
what you say can do you no harm
blame nobody but me for what happened to griggsby and lacey said carruthers
the rest of the boys had nothin to do with it
i went farther with griggsby than i meant to and thats the truth
i knew mallory had struck something rich at the mariquita and i wanted him to lose
i asked deane to help me beat mallory out and he said he would keep him dangling until the last minute and then turn him down cold
so he did but not uniil he had got me with my back to the wall
it was either sell out to mallory for the twentyfive thousand or to deane at double that
he had me and he knew it but i swore he would never get any good from the mine until he deeded me a half interest
that is what i was fighting for ransom
for that i laid low in the hills fighting the work at the mariquita
i did whatever i could to make deane sick of his bargain and to force him to come to me
i know have had him too if it hadnot been for bremerton girl got bremerton away from us
i tried to follow them into the gully and find out where they went butbut i slipped from the rope as some one fired at my men in the swale voice died in his throat
he looked at ohara and his lips framed a silent word
ransom nodded to ohara then went to bremerton took the hastily scrawled transcript and read it over while the flutes music once more throbbed through the room
over and over while the tide ebbed ohara breathed the intermezzo into the dead wood and warmed it into life
the doctor watching carruthers finally went to the bedside and bent down to touch his wrist
that will be all said the doctor to ohara hes past hearing you
the sheriff had cracked the shell of a troublesome mystery
his professional satisfaction was jarred a bit in congruously by a sentiment perfectly human and somewhat awkward the way like to go out myself when i have to he murmured got a melodeon to home
give me the name of that piece ohara so i can have my daughter learn it
ohara with pity in his pale eyes stood looking down at carruthers
faith said he theres good in the worst of us and bad in the best of us and theres some hope for the man who goes beyond with the love o music in his soul
he laid the hands on the breast and gently drew the blanket over the face but cogs in the wheel anyway he added and the machine keeps running even if a cog here and there is not what it ought to be
come out in the other room all of you requested the sheriff while i read what bremerton took down fresh in your minds you know and i want you to sign as witnesses
they grouped about ransom in the office and listened while he read
after that each set his hand to the document a black spot cleared up went on ransom
beats all i never thought of carruthers in this matter of griggsby
but thats the way
the plain truth is so plain sometimes were apt to dodge it
he turned to bremerton
thanks to you bremerton from this on deane will have clear sailing
do you know blamed glad of one thing that inquired bremerton
why that the mallorys had no hand in the lawlessness out here
there was a spell when it looked dark for them
no objection to havingthat nodded toward the bedroom here until i can get the undertakers out
certainly not
then suppose we hike morton be ready in a minute ransom said the doctor
he went to the end of the pipeline and washed his hands
when he had returned to thq office and slipped into his coat the sheriff had the machine ready
bremerton meanwhile had picked up a pad of telegraph blanks and written the following silas deane denver
have cleaned up on the other crowd and located bonanza vein on mariquita property
important you come on at once
notify and will meet you he went out of the office and handed the message to the sheriff
send that for me will you ransom he asked
let it go collect
glad to oblige said the sheriff
will get it on the wires as soomas i hit town
bremerton and ohara watched the car vanish over the rise in the trail jand then the irishman after a long look at his friend turned on his heel and moved off toward the mill
the news spread through the camp that carruthers the man who had located the mine and added to his holdings until they embraced the whole valley and the neighboring hills had gone his way and was lying in the headquarters adobe
when the day men came off duty and the night men went on all eyes sought the little office building awed and curious
the same eyes presently shifted to bremerton and paid him a tribute of respect and high consideration
carruthers represented the evil powers that had skulked in the hills fighting men savagely and murderously
with carruthers those powers had been laid low and all the credit was given to bremerton
a better spirit manifested itself among the workers
in the evening bremerton and ohara carried their chairs out of the office and sat by the door
the irishman fluted the airs dearest to his heart and the other smoked reflectively
by and by the flute was laid aside and ohara himself filled a pipe and blew fragrant wreaths into the still air wired for deane announced the superintendent
there was no demonstration from ohara
leaning back against the adobe wall he puffed serenely at his pipe
i say i have sent for deaneasked him to come on immediately repeated bremerton
i knew youd do that or go to denver one or the other said ohara
what will you do lee
what would you do mike divil knows expecting though that youll keep your head and be sensible
none of the lee reckless in your accounting with deane man
you were to blame along at the first by getting into this so easy forget that
carruthers mused bremerton got only what was coming to him
his fight with deane was a case of diamond cut diamond and right or wrong wouldnot have been strained whichever way the cards fell
but between the two of them the mallorys were crushed and beaten and flung to the scrapheap
the rights most to be considered were not considered at all the point that involves and concerns me
i took word and helped him rob the mallorys of what was justly theirs weighed heavily in the words
the wrath of a man who had all his life tried to be square only to have a friend besmirch his ideals and sully his honor swirled in the tones of voice
after all lee said ohara soothingly tis no crime youve done
you stepped aside in taking sayso when you should have gone under the surface indications
we all do that same more or less
when were in wrong the part of a wise man is to retire gracefully and in order
which is the same as saying with as little trouble as possible
in my opinion the mallorys are beyond help so far as this mine is concerned see about that and face hardened and his teeth clicked on his pipestem not take my advice i know in your present temper but so help me be around and have a hand in what happens if you go too far
mind that
at that juncture a long black wagon rolled along the trail turned and came to a halt in front of the office
two men got down from the seat and one approached bremerton
mr bremerton
yes
the sheriff sent us out
come with me said bremerton and led the way into the office was next day that i man rode out from town with an answer to message
shake
knew youd turn the trick
meet me phoenix friday morning
the superintendent smiled grimly
deane was coming and he was destined to receive a few surprisesnot all of them pleasant
on thursday afternoon bremerton sent to the bunkhouse for gorman the night amalgamator
this millman was the key to some things which the superintendent wanted to know
gorman usually slept in the forenoon and loafed in the afternoon messenger found him and he came straight to the office
he was a rateyed weaselfaced little man whose main object in life seemed to be to keep out of sight
the most devious way between two points was the shortest for gorman
he entered the office so silently that bremerton did not know he was there until he was seen beside the desk
on deck mr bremerton said gorman nervously
sit down said the superintendent
the millman cuddled into a chair and looked about him shiftily
he had the air of one who was expecting something disagreeable to happen
if youre under the impression gorman that i donot know youre a thief you are mistaken
the quiet conversational tone was weirdly out of harmony with the sentiment expressed manner disarmed gorman for a moment and then when the burden of the words had sunk in he bristled angrily
nobody can talk to me like that by gorry
insults like them i never stood for and never will my time be a fool returned bremerton
you know that if you had your deserts youd have been caught in the same net that snared big steve and chombo
while steve was here you turned in no more amalgam than he did since hes been gone youve been turning in three times as much as you did before
i was pretty sure you were stealing but i had no time to bother with you
now that youre evidently playing fair i have no inclination to make you trouble
all i want you to do is to talk
some men with a guilty conscience can bluff successfully
gorman was not one of that kind
for long he had been afraid he was suspected
i ainot admitting a thing said gorman but what do you want me to talk about where were you on the night i reached phoenix king was in charge here and somebody had brought a supply of whisky into camp
not much work was going on
i guess you remember
the millman wriggled uncomfortably
i donot get you at all he answered
i been at the mariquita right along hem and haw and sidestep returned bremerton not intending to take any action against you be more kindly disposed however if you come out squaretoed and tell me what you know
were you and big steve directly connected with carruthers gorman took a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket and drew it across his face
he was undergoing an ordeal and showed it straight now mr bremerton he whimpered tryin to do whats right
you ainot going to put me through if i tell the truth
no
do i get fired not so long as you keep straight
well then chombo worked with carruthers and big steve worked with chombo and i worked with steve the gospel of it and kiss the book
i didnot want to go in on it
backed away from the propersition for quite a spell
steve allowed though that they was going to get their toll of amalgam from the night shift and if i didnot come over then some night turn up missin and thered be an amalgamator in my place they could depend on
i was scared into it mr bremerton thats all
who disposed of the amalgam chombo got it to carruthers and he turned it into cash
we all got our whack and it was purty profitable
when chombo had the pin pulled on him steve sneaked the stuff out of camp
but i reckon you know about that
have you any idea why the stuff jvas cached at oak flat
it wasnot always cached there chombo picked out that place
why
i donot know only what i heard from big steve
what did you hear why that if you found out anythin carruthers wanted to make it look bad for the mallorys murmured bremerton and sat back in his chair
following a moments reflection he went on who left the mariquita mine that night the crowd beat me up at the phoenix townditch
not me said gorman hastily i wasnot among em
was steve bryden in the gang
no
steve was jest gittin busy yvith the likker
i heard that chombo was with that outfit purty sure no one else from the camp had a hand in the doings ball of amalgam was dropped by one of the crowd
then it was chombo dropped it
he was holdin out a little on carruthers right along
thus one dark point was cleared up
bremerton believed that the fellow he had knocked into the canal was chombo
what men did carruthers have with him out in the hills
do you know that gorman
they was men who had been bounced from the mine
griggsby let one or two go and lacey ditched the others
carruthers gathered em in and they was more than willin to help him
he made it worth their while
where are those men now
why when carruthers went out them fellers began to runand i allow theyre still a runnin
you can gamble a blue stack they wonot show up around here no more mr bremerton
i canot think of anything else gorman said the superintendent in luck to come out of that amalgam deal as well as you have
keep that in mind
that will be all
the millman arose and passed softly toward the door
he halted there for a final word to stay on and have no trouble
so long as you do the right thing gorman you neednot worry
i know in luck and standin pat on an honest deal
much obliged to you mr bremerton
he faded out of the office and the superintendent was positive that the fangs of last enemy had been drawn
from that time on there would be only clear sailing for those in charge of the mariquita mine
everything was propitious for that final accounting with deane
thursday afternoon bremerton had dutch fred put a pair of cayuses to the pole of the mine buckboard
when the rig was ready and the superintendent was about to climb into it for the ride to phoenix ohara came down from the mill off after deane bremerton asked the irishman
yes was the answer reach phoenix in the morning and i intend to bring the rest of this business to a close in short order
a worried look crossed face not your plan is it to do anything in phoenix or on the way out he continued
there had been something that bremerton had wanted to say to his friend for several days
here was a good time for it
mike youre not my guardian
no man could ask for a better friend but there is a dead line which even a friend cannot cross without making trouble
my business with deane is my own affair and going to handle it in my own way without let or hindrance from you meddle
keep hands off not let that hot head of yours take you to the divil entirely flared ohara
so help me not have you doing time for roughing it with a yellow dog like deane
smoke that in your pipe
ohara turned back to the mill
bremerton stared after him speculatively then climbed into the buckboard and drove away
at the fork in the trail he was surprised to find mariquita mounted on her horse and evidently waiting for him
she rode out into the road ahead of his team
you have asked deane to come here she exclaimed
it was necessary he returned
you get your information direct from denver i suppose
you already know mr bremerton that we have a friend in denver office
why why have you done this she spoke vehemently passionately and clearly was doubtful of motives
i told you miss mallory that you would have to trust me he said calmly
you are not doing it
you have sent for deane to show him thatthat lost lead yes
i want him to understand that the work he gave me to do has been accomplished
how will that help us she cried
by showing him how valuable the mine is how are you going to benefit my father and me i have my plans
you know deane pretty well and i guess you realize that what i have ahead of me is anything but childs play
i am going to do what i can
that miss mallory is all any man can do
are you going to lose confidence in me she rode alongside the buckboard and leaned sidewise to offer her hand
no she said softly and with a wan smile for you are the only one who can do anything with deane
help us and it will be worth your while
if you win an interest for us in the property i have come to tell you that a part of it will be yours
he dropped the hand as though a serpent had stung him
you know me very well he answered
i canot be bribed miss mallory and sorry you thought so
he picked up the lines and drove on
until he was out of sight the girl sat motionless in the saddle looking after him
bremerton had work that evening in phoenix
he called on a lawyer and had a certain paper filled out and made ready for signing
on his way back to the hotel he stepped into a hardware store and bought a small revolver to take the place of the automatic he had lost
the dealer wanted to sell him a box of cartridges
bremerton however did not buy
i want is the revolver he said
with the legal paper in the breast of his coat and the unloaded revolver in his hippocket he retraced his way to the hotel
the train from the north was due at seven oclock
it rolled up to the station promptly on time and deane was the last passenger to get out of the pullman
the porter obsequiously handed him a black boston bag receiving in exchange for it a silver dollar
the mining king was a picturesque figure as he came down the platform
his black stetson longtailed coat and flowing tie compelled attention
a wonderful diamond sparkled in the white frills of his shirt and a massive chain wriggled across the front of his lowcut vest
another stone conspicuous for size and brilliancy was very much in evidence on the third finger of his left hand
good living and lack of exercise had doubled his girth since the prospecting days with bremerton
his walk was the cautious flatfooted waddle of the fat man although he carried it off with a touch of distinction 
all in all he was a most impressing spectacle
it was plain that he knew it and equally plain that he liked it
his money had brought with it power and influence and no man was more in the western limelight
the reporters for three different newspapers had reached him ahead of bremerton
they wanted interviews
blamed if i can travel a dozen miles out of denver without having a bunch of you cimarrons tight at my heels he complained goodnaturedly
now boys i havenot a pesky thing for you to put in the papers
maybe have news for you before i leave
if i have i promise to herd you all together treat every one fair and not play favorites
try one of these will you and just forget in town till ready to loosen up
he drew a silvermounted cigarcase from the breast of his coat and offered it around
then he caught sight of bremerton
howdy pard he cried breaking away from the newspapermen dropping his satchel and grabbing the tall gaunt figure in corduroys with both hands
you done it by thunder and way this side of the six months
lee youre the clear quill
looking finern silk too
what did i say huh
did i know what i was doing or didnot i a cab go to the hotel and sit in at the chucktable hungriern a ute squaw on government rations
bremerton picked up the satchel deane hooked arms with him and they went on to the waiting line of carriages
a little later they were being hurried to the best hotel in town deane talking effusively and giving his friend no chance for a word
there was the plaza same old courthouse plaza where he and bremerton had sat in the shade years ago wondering where they would strike for next
yes and by gorry there was the same identical umhrella tree they had sat under it beat all how the old times came back
below the corner of first avenue was the wall of the town corral where they had kept their burros and saywouldnot it rattle your there was coffee where they had spent many a quarter for grub
good grub too better grub than any deane had ever had since or anyhow it tasted better
i guess its a sureenough fact lee philosophized deane that the more money you got to spend for things the less you appreciate em
oh them sure was good days
the mining king sat back into his coat and relapsed into a mood of flabby and morbid reminiscence
he came out of it shortly and dropped a fat friendly hand on knee
why donot you tune up old partner he asked
i donot reckon youve peeped since we got together
the recollection of old times when deane was different and a comrade worth having had wrenched hard at the purpose bremerton had in mind
he brushed the feeling aside and looked into his friends face with a smile been holding my tongue and listening to you silas he answered
not much chance for me to put in a word when you get started right i guess thats right and deane chuckled
this is a regular picnic for me
old scenes old friends and a pot of money into the bargain
enough to make a fellow grow young and feel his oats eh they got down at the hotel and deane handed the black bag to a waiting boy
careful with that son he warned two pint bottles of old scotch in that grip and if anything happens to em ruined
deane wrote his name on the register
he began placing under it but the latter protested booked at another hotel said he going to be booked at this one too going to have breakfast together already had breakfast
why didnot you wait dash it youre treating me like a hired man more than a pard eat again thats all name went down and deane insisted that he accompany him up to his room
the black bag was opened and deane pulled out a flannel shirt a slouch hat a pair of khaki trousers and a pair of laced kneeboots
he laughed like a boy as he showed the outfit
bet your life old pard i brought my war clothes along
after i eat going to get into em and you and me will go pottering off into the hills same as we used to
great
it wonot be hardly the same si said bremerton
instead of walking and driving our packburros well ride in a buckboard they got any automobiles in this mans town automobiles are a cultivated taste and the superintendent at the mariquita canot afford so much style only a counterfeit at this oldtime game deane
two days of the old life would kill you
maybe youre right
help yourself to thisevery swig is warranted to take ten years off your shoulders prime
a man in denver gets it for me special
bremerton did not drink
he wanted a clear jiead while he was with deane
while his back was turned he unscrewed the cap and let it go at that
deane faced around took the flask out of his hands and helped himself generously
in a few minutes they went down to breakfast together
deane raided the bill of fare while bremerton contented himself with a cup of coffee and griddlecakes
not much was said about the mine
it was a subject for private discussion and that diningroom was altogether too public a place
after the meal bremerton left deane to get into his war clothes and went after the team and buckboard
it was ten oclock before they took the trail into the hills
now remarked deane when they had left the town well behind them we can get down to cases lee pleased me a heap the way youve managed things
old griggsby was a false alarm and lacey was a weak sister
you grabbed the big difficulties by the scruff of the neck and chucked em into the discard
knew you would
this in few words was estimate of the man who had died trying to serve him and of the other who had gone down to physical wreck in his employ
you donot know what griggsby would have done if your enemies hadnot picked him off said bremerton sharply and lacey is a whole man seen him and i know
oh well yes if you want it that way returned deane impatiently
success though is the only thing that counts
you pulled the old workings through to gloty and there wasnot much fuss about it either
reel that off to me
bremerton proceeded to reel it off
he took a good deal of satisfaction in making the case as bad as it was
beginning with the assault by the town canal he followed with the capture of steve and chombo then told of the shot at the fork of the trail and finished with the fate of carruthers
skilfully he left mariquita mallory out of the narrative
not once was her name mentioned
his discovery of the lost lead was dealt with indefinitelytreated as an accident
for all this he had his reasons
mariquita and her father would become prominent enough before he was through with the mining king
deane was absorbed in the recital
the fire went out of his cigar again and again
he breathed hard in the pinches and by the town canal and at the fork in the trail his fat hands clenched and he swore under his breath
but his fat face beamed while bremerton was describing that footwide vein back of the overhang take my oath lee he commented earnestly when the telling was done i never thought carruthers would rough things up like that become of the law in these parts anyhow it protect a man in keeping his own
never mind that though
a miss is as good as a mile and you skinned the gang
it makes my blood sing just to hear you palaver about it
a months running on that bonanza ore and the mines as good as sold
half a million by thunder and it cost me only fifty thousand business bremerton the way to get rich
there were no regrets for that mound over griggsby in the phoenix cemetery and not a word of commiseration for the unlucky lacey eye was single to that half million
it completely filled his perspective
bremerton knew that if he 5had fallen at the fork of the trail his moneygrubbing friend would have experienced few twinges and few regrets
the roar of flood waters in arapahoe canon was almost silenced
deane had strangled his finer sentiments with a rope of gold
the deane that was and the deane who now sat at side in the buckboard were two different men
this realization did much to reconcile bremerton to the course he had mapped out for himself
in the interests of right and justice he could deal with this swaggering purseproud trickster as he could not have dealt his old loyal prospectorfriend
deane offered bremerton a cigar
bremerton declined and filled and lighted his pipe
for some time they traveled in silence
finally deane aroused to observe i consider bremerton that another month of you at the mine will be enough getting out for fifteen hundred less than i calculated on
eh
the superintendents eyes narrowed that he asked
deane repeated his words
bremerton had heard them plainly enough the first time but he wanted them repeated
you mean said he that i was hired for six months for three thpusand dollars and that inasmuch as i have made good in half the time i am only entitled to half pay
is that it
something like that replied deane giving a canny glance out of the tails of his eyes
are you going to split the tenthousanddollar bonus in two as well asked bremerton dryly
well what do you think
i donot know deane
i shall have to give it a little reflection
of course i intend to do the right thing burst out the other in a flurry of virtuous determination not be small with a friend and you can gamble a blue stack on that
think it over old pard leave it to you
whatever you say is right goes with deane
here was the final straw
for risking his life for robbing the mallorys for making the mine worth half a million deane could haggle with his old friend over the paltry sum that was to be paid
yes certainly bremerton would think it over
a flurry of excitement passed through the camp with the arrival of deane
every worker wanted a look at the big boss
he was discussed frankly by a few
these maintained that he won his games by jumping men over the business checkerboard sacrificing ruthlessly in his dash for the kingrow
they said that his employees were catspaws for pulling his golden chestnuts out of the fire that he had not the nerve for executing his own schemes that he bought men in open market and played them selfishly and unscrupulously for his own lawless gain
talk of this kind however left no sentiment of disgust or disapproval in its train success and his wealth dazzled the eyes and confused the understanding
the mining king was a rugged and prominent figure all up and down the pacific slope and men shut their eyes to his past and gave him a hand for what he was
ohara took no part in the buzzing gossip in the mill
he listened passively while giles and the engineer shouted confidences to each other about the mineowner
the irishman had tact as well as the courage of his convictions
in the late afternoon deane and bremerton visited the blind gully and searched out a place where the visitor could be lowered with least danger and physical effort to himself
then they went to the overhang and examined the bonanza lead
deane was astounded overjoyed
he talked of running up the price on the syndicate and of profiting more largely by his superintendents work
his greed outran his delight and his stuffy voice jingled with prospective dollars
he swaggered up and down the tunnel
he bragged about what he had and what he was going to have the things he had done and the things he would do and he wound up with dam it bremerton i donot know but take the bit in my teeth and insist on giving you every sou of that ten thousand
they returned to the mine in time for supper and deane insisted on sitting at table with the grimy sweatstained workers
he tried to be a good fellow and monopolized the conversation with jokes and witticisms
the jokes were coarse and the witticisms farfetched but they never failed to draw a laugh
following supper and cigars smoked in front of the headquarters adobe bremerton made ready to tighten the coil
as a preliminary step he invited deane to step into the office respect for himself would not allow of association with deane
he kept away from the headquarters adobe but watched it carefully from the shadow of the blinkhouse
when the mineowner and the superintendent retired into the office the irishman approached the little mudwalled building and took up his position at a point where the mumbling voices reached his ears
the matter of what bremerton was about to do worried him
he knew his friend so well that he was expecting drastic measures and these he was confident deane would fight
out of that clash what was to come
when the voices grew high when passion pitched them in the high key that meant a narrowing of argument and a resort to force ohara was planning to interfere
bremerton might go too far with was conceivableand the irishman would step in and call a halt before his friend went to extremes
while biding his time with every nerve tense and every faculty alert ohara heard a sound of galloping
he sprang into the trail and was suddenly confronted by mariquita mallory
saints defend us he gasped
miss mallory you will please forgive me for saying it but this is no place for you
where is mr bremerton the girl demanded where is deane
i want to talk with them
i watched while deane was taken inter the gully and shown the bonanza lead and i came here to do what i can to get our rights
och wurra what a night it is sighed ohara
will you be listening to me
miss mallory
it will do you no good to see deane
bremerton has him in the office now and will fight it out with him he has his plans divil knows what they are and if bremerton canot do anything then nobody can
will you please go away afraid for you here not go away she declared stay on the ground till its settled
why are you here air
ohara
faith now its just td be handy in case needed
a better man than bremerton never lived and i canot let him get the worst of anything or you think hes in danger murmured mariquita quickly you think hes risking his life trying to get our rights for us
never not in the way you mean and ohara laughed shortly
why lee could take this fat mining king with one hand and strangle the breath out of him
begorry its that or something like it that worries me the worst of the law do you mind
you canot kill a human coyote though he is and no matter what he deserves without complications with sheriffs and courts and prison walls
if necessary here to save bremerton from that
then stay with you and help you
in spite of his protests she stayed leaving her horse by the corral and then sitting beside ohara on the rockheap where he had posted himself
they listened silently to the drone of voices and once tones rose high and his words came to them distinctly working for me
what are the mallorys to you that youre so keen for them hand clutched ofrm convulsively and a sharp breath fluttered through her lips stand to his guns this bremerton whispered ohara
i know him i tell you
again deane lifted his angry voice a d traitor thats what you are
you was on the rocks and i gave you a chance
this is what i get for it
the likes of him to be talking to bremerton like that gritted ohara where i begin expecting trouble say anything donot do anything just listen and leave it to me miss mallory
so anxious and apprehensive they waited and listened
meanwhile in the office matters were approaching a climax
deane had followed bremerton into the office wonderingly
there was that in face which deane remembered to have seen there out around san simone once when they were cornered by mexicans bent oil taking their burros and camp equipment
the look and manner of the superintendent puzzled deane
bremerton lighted the lamp and placed it on top of the desk then he waved deane to a chair
silas said bremerton banteringly youre a shrewd one tell me in denver how you got hold of the mariquita mine
i asked you if it was a square deal you remember and you said it was
well wasnot it
it was clever and a false note of admiration rang in bremerton voice
you kept mallory dangling while you put on a side deal with carruthers
mallory was an old fool chuckled deane whose ear was too gross to detect the false note
i let him nibble and then jerked the bait away from him
but i didnot do that by thunder until it was toolate for him to raise the money in other quarters
carruthers was harder to manage
he was as big a fool though as mallory
he could have extended the time for mallory but he was afraid
i had offered him twentyfive thousand better than mallory was to give him and his greed got the better cf his common sense
then after it was all over carruthers got sore and began to holler
a lot of good that did him
bremerton sat quietly and listened and marveled
this was his old friend who was talking a man who had shared his blanket and his wavering fortunes for years something for you to store up for future use bremerton went on deane with the air of one who wished to see another prosper along the lines he had made his own seen how i pulled this off
quit being so blamed conscientious and profit by the lesson
get busy on a scheme of your own
nothing on earth to hinder you from getting where i am but your fool notions about whats right and whats wrong
do the other fellow for a spell and donot let him do you
sabe
oh i sabe all right answered bremerton
maybe it seems strange to you deane but rather have my fool notions than all your pile of dirty dollars that snapped the other willing enough to take my dirty dollars by thunder
yes and you helped me here forget that really the one who put this scheme across
that lost lead will do the trick
griggsby couldnot find it and lacey couldnot find it ou got onto it and you were my last bet paid me a thousand dollars continued the superintendent the money
i donot want it
he flung the package of banknotes brought to him by ohara on the table in front of deane
the latter grew red and apoplectic this whats this he muttered choppily the money you have paid me
now you canot throw it in my face that profited by your dirty work
my hands are clean for whats to come
i have something also to tell you deane
i want to appeal to your sense of justiceif you have any left in your goldseared soul
it was mariquita mallory who saved me from carruthers that morning at the fork of the trail
my horse was dragging me through the swale
she stopped the brute
yes and when carruthers and his gang were shooting at us and driving us from cover to cover mariquita mallory took me into the gully
we would have been picked off by the bullets had she not led me under the overhang
that is how i came to discover the lost vein
it would never have been found otherwise and this property would have continued to be nothing more than a poor proposition and dear at the fifty thousand you paid for it had miss malory not taken me into that tunnel
deane stared at bremerton his little eyes glimmering
but he had not a word to say
you see how it is deane the superintendent continued
merely as a matter of right a simple case of justice asking you to deed a half interest in the mine to mariquita mallory
when that had taken length breadth and depth in mine he gave vent to a roar of wrath working for me
what are the mallorys to you that youre so keen for them not working for you silas
i resign
carruthers is out of the running the bonanza ledge is found and there is nothing between you and half a million but a little time for putting rich ore through the mill
i want to say however that i am not going to help you rob the mallorys when all the credit is due the girl
get that
deane gave vent to another roar and floundered out of his chair
he shook a fat fist at his old friend and leaned across the table to shout a traitor thats what you are
you was on the rocks and i gave you a chance
that is what i get for it
a gray eyes gleamed like polished steel
in just one second he was all energy and flaming resolution
a bound landed him on his feet and he threw himself half across the table to look into face
yes a traitor he said between his teeth
the best thing done since i came to the mariquita mine is to turn against you
the silas deane of five years ago is dead youre not even the shell of him a knave a thief and a liar you make a move deane
sit downthere at my desk
a move of the right hand and bremerton was looking over the sights of a revolver little eyes grew filmy the purple died from his flabby cheeks and left them a sickly pasty white
this mining king had never been a coward
he knew bremerton however
that voice that look meant that bremerton was no longer bremerton but lee reckless
the change from the quiet selfrestrained man to another whose will as his only law and whose hand would stop at nothing had been consummated in a flash
deane slumped heavily against the table
slowly he raised a hand
for sake bremerton he whispered hoarsely come out of that your old partnerremember arapahoe canon
remember them days when we sit down
the command was sharp and metallic like the snapping of a trigger
deane wheezed and rolled backward into a chair
the point of the revolver followed him
is this what you got me out here for he mumbled to threaten and bullyrag me on my own property i brought you out here you miserable excuse for the man i used to know to force you to do one thingjust one thing that you can look back on without regret when you take the long trail
do you think my nerve will fail and that i will hang back
say thick shoulders quivered
he crouched forward his elbows on the desk and spoke weakly over his shoulder no
in your present temper youd do anything the right point to start on get me wrong
and donot you dare mention arapahoe canon
the words in your mouth are an insult to the silas deane who was my friend
you killed him you bragging murderous hound
for that alone youre not fit to live crazy came gurglingly from deane worked for you here risked my neck for you and given back the money for which i sold myself
before i wash my hands of you though theres one thing more
bremerton groped for the breast of his coat with his left hand
not once did he take his gleaming eyes off deane a deed to a halfinterest in the mariquita mine bremerton went on sign and convey a part of this property to the person who is entitled to all of it mariquita mallory
he flung the document down on the desk
this blow at the most vulnerable point brought back his couragefor a moment
not if you kill me he muttered my property and youll not rob me
a deed like that wouldnot hold good in law nohow you sense enough to know that it will hold goodthis deed never dispute it
if you try that youll know that alive and camped on your trail
pick up that pen and sign your name
again deane turned his ghastly face over his shoulder
the muzzle of a blued barrel was within a yard of him and back of the barrel was a man primed with a reckless disregard of consequences hands trembled
he picked up the paper and bowed close to read it
it fell from his shaking fingers and dropped to the floor sign under protest said deane
pick it up for me
get it yourself wise to your tricks
deane bent over grunting and wheezing
the chair slipped from under him and he went to his knees
then reaching for the deed with his left hand he brought his right to the front of the blue flannel shirt
the thick fingers caught at a handgrip
the sharpeyed bremerton caught the move but it was too late to interfere
the table was between him and deane
oh you cur cried bremerton you shadow of the man that deane pressed a trigger
a bullet tore its way through the front of his shirt and ranged upward over his left arm hands dropped and he swayed a moment
tricky to the last he gasped
that gununder the didnot know he fell sprawling backward with a force that made the adobe walls shiver and sent the lampflame flaring into the chimney
a scream came from somewhere
deane did not hear it
approaching footsteps crunched the gravel
and deane did not hear them
mechanically he picked up the deed and straightened erect
walking around the table he stood looking down on bremerton with staring uncomprehending eyes
ohara sprang furiously into the room out of the night
one look at the form on the floor and he jumped at deane
i thought it was you not bremerton he cried kill you for this
no rasped deane lifting his revolver and leveling it not kill me
stand where you are
the long body doubled forward the muzzle looking him between the eyes
he choked and the fingers of his extended hands closed helplessly into the palms
mariquita was in the room but she seemed lost to what was passing between the two men
her concern was all for bremerton
kneeling she took his head in her arms
softly she pushed back the hair from his temples and kissed his brow his cheek his lips
for me she whispered for me
oh i want you to live so i can repay you for this
i want you she paused her broken voice trailing off into quiet
softly from gripping fingers she removed the revolver
look she said
there are no loads in it
ohara reached for the weapon examined it and with sneering contempt exhibited it to deane
he was bluffing you said he and like a friend like an old partner you called his bluff
oh if that can get under your skin think of it now carry it about in your head for years to come
but look for mike ohara
you owe me something for this nights work deane and its a debt youll pay
deane backed away from the harmless revolver as from a rattlesnake
he was staring at it as he reached the door and he was still staring as he stepped backward into the night the folded paper in one hand and the leveled revolver in the other
another moment and he was gone
he passed king in the doorway and king whirled in a frenzy of consternation and ran off toward the bunkhouse
deane has killed bremerton he shouted
his voice died out in the sullen hum of the mill
king still shouting frenziedly raced on to the sleeping dayshift with his news
ohara would have gone in pursuit of deane had not mariquita stopped him
it is not deane but bremerton who should have our attention now mr ohara said she
help me
the irishman was like a man in a dream
he and the girl between them gathered bremerton up in their arms and carried him to the bed in the other room
then an oath burst from ohara and he ran out into the night men were rushing from the bunkhouse
the mill clattered into silence and gorman led a wild group over the oreplatform and toward the office
who did it shouted gorman
is it true true as gospel answered ohara
deane shot bremerton down
find let him be after getting away in this camp
but deane was not in the camp
he had taken horse which was ready at his hand by the corral and had fled
all the livestock was pressed into service for the chase
ohara took one cayuse and red collins another
case went bareback on one of his horses and king took the other
dutch team was likewise requisitioned
the doctor and the sheriff we need them again called ohara as he galloped away
king thats your work
the little cyanid expert for once in his life felt equal to anything
he started on the long ride to town
for the rest of that night mining and milling were forgotten
the men clustered in groups around the headquarters adobe talked while waiting for the searchers to return and looked through the window at the prostrate silent form on the bed
mariquita was doing what she could
she was all womanly tenderness and whenever her hands touched bremerton it was like a caress
giles the oneeyed tiptoed into the room
he carried his hat in his hand think hell live mum
oh he will he must the girl answered
have you sent for a doctor king went but its a long trip and it will be sunup afore any one from town gits here
what can we do mum i can do everything said mariquita
and hes goin to pull through
yes yes
giles tiptoed out again and spread the news
a faint husky cheer came from the men
bremerton had proved himself a man and his hold upon the workers had strengthened even beyond his own knowledge
slowly the dark hours slipped away and mariquita sat by the unconscious bremerton clasping his hand and waiting and hoping for the return of consciousness
one by one the searchers came back
deane had eluded them
ohara resolutely took his place at side
he was somber and griefstricken for his friend and all consideration and kindliness toward the girl
go home miss mallory he begged
tis too much for you like a ghost ask me to leave him she answered
i canot
ohara looked at her closely and a flash of understanding broke over him
he smiled softly
if thats the way of it said he then sure you must stay
they fought hard for hours to bring bremerton back
ragged streamers of dawn floated over the eastern hills before they succeeded
the first face bremerton saw was his blank eyes slowly filled with realization
i did my best for you novia he muttered
the girls eyes burned
leaning down she took one of his hands in both her own and held it to her white cheek
novia she whispered
is it true then
he disengaged his hand and groped at the breast of his flannel shirt
he found there only a bandage
a troubled look came into his eyes
from her own bosom the girl took a glove stained red at the fingers
here went on mariquita
i found her head went down on the pillow beside his
novio mio she added in a stifled voice what matters the mine or anything else now that we know
he smiled up into face
and then the throb of a motorcar awakened echoes in the silent camp
the car halted in front of the office and ransom and dr morton and could scarcely believe his came into the room
what in the name of began the sheriff then saw mariquita and bit off his words been going on here
who shot bremerton
deane brought us word and we hit only the high places coming back of this black business
deane can tell you cried ohara
deane shot bremerton
the nerve of him to come back here like this
deane was haggard and about spent
what he had passed through he alone knew
it was an accident said bremerton
lee protested ohara
it was an accident insisted bremerton
deane turned away and staggered out into the other room
the time came when michael ohara sitting under the oaks in the canon with his flute paused in his playing to think of what had been and of what was to be
the old wanderlust was strong within him and the beckoning hills would have had him long since but for bremerton
he could not vanish before his friend was on his feet and the future way made straight for him
twas coming four weeks now since the accidental shooting
deane had gone away immediately but conscience had spoken to him that night
why else had he gone for the sheriff and the doctor and come out with them to the mine
his heart was sore for his anger and his hastiness
he wanted to know that his old friend would live
he wanted to see with his own eyes that he had not opened the gates for a dauntless spirit
well he saw
troth and he heard bremerton speak and insist on the words that cleared him
after that he went away and not once had he been heard from
another superintendentfrom colorado he wascame in a week
he had a smooth boyish face and his brown eyes turned often to mariquita who would not leave side
but the girl thought only lived only for the man under her care and the brown eyes were disappointed
it was easy sailing for the new super
the mill was grinding bonanza rock and was closed down every other day for a partial cleanup
men with guns stood guard by the plates and people from phoenix came to see that new wonder in the phoenix mountains a mine whose performance outran expectations
it was no place for a sick man what with the stream of visitors and the excitement
so in a week bremerton was moved to oak flat in the canon
mariquita would have it that way and it was admitted that no one had a better right to dictate
red collins and gorman had charge of the transfer and their aids were dutch fred and chase
ohara stood vigilantly by and there were certain safeguards insisted on by mariquita
a hammock was stretched between two saddlehorses and in it lay bremerton
without a jar he was carried over the trail and to the house among the oaks
the girl made it plain to ohara that he was to stay with his friend and together they had been there nearly three weeks
red collins or gorman or gilesonce it was over from the valley at frequent intervals to inquire about bremerton and to leave news about the mine
the remarkable showing which the property was making brought deane many offers
they eclipsed the halfmillion mark toward which they had striven at the first
there was no telling now what some one might pay for the mariquita
a fortune might have been yours querida said bremerton to the girl nee when he was beginning to sit up
she leaned over the back of his chair her soft arms encircling his neck and her happy eyes looking down into his face
what is money lee she asked to the other prize i have found
no one could buy it with all the gold in all the hills of this world not your prize he doggedly averred but mine
out under the oaks with his flute on his knees ohara was wondering what bremerton was to do
new responsibilities were coming to him and how were they to be shouldered
then along the canon trail came horses and a buckboard with two men riding
the men turned in at the flat and the rig halted near ohara
the irishman got up with his faded crooked eyes agleam
one man had descended from the buckboard and was coming toward him
it was silas deane draw ohara said deane
faith said the other not heeled
if i had something to draw you have something and little eye twinkled
draw on your imagination
what am i here for
divil a bit said ohara scowling
who can do any guessing about you from the open door of the house at that moment came bremerton
mariquita walked beside him and his arm was over her strong young shoulders
they came toward ohara and deane and the mine owner watched bremerton closely
an easy chair in the shade had been arranged and mariquita made bremerton comfortable in it and then turned with hostile eyes to the visitor
bremerton had looked at deane without speaking
to what mr deane inquired the girl do we owe this call i have a good bid for the mine and i think we had better sell
what have i to do with that
as much as i have
for nearly a month you have owned a half interest in the mariquita mine
the deed was recorded the day following thethe accident
ohara was like a man in a daze
mariquita was breathing quickly and her trembling hands sought the back of chair
bremerton merely studied face
bremerton made me see a light explained deane
he showed me how to be square
i want his goodwill miss mallory and i want yours and your fathers
i reckon i acted like a coyote
i have enough and to spare and neither chick nor child to leave it to
the man in the buckboard is a notary
if you are ready to sign this deed brought along tomorrow you and your father wijl have enough in bank to make the rest of your lives easy
bremerton struggled to his feet and put out his hand
his face was glowing with happiness
silas my old partner he exclaimed
you have come back
i can hear the flood waters in arapahoe canon
this time though you have saved more than my life that queried deane gripping the hand
bremerton turned to take mariquita in his arms
whisht murmured ohara taking deane by the sleeve and drawing him away you see how it is i knew it from the start shake with you too silas deane
neither you nor i can be best friend any more
the girl god bless her is nearest his heart made their future safe and you ought to be happy
ohara wiped his eyes that divilish flute he asked looking around blindly
