two hundred and fifty dollar be send to -PRON- 
-PRON- fee be fifty dollar and -PRON- cost fifty dollar to have a private detective hunt -PRON- up at that twelfth street boardinghouse 
i be tell merely that -PRON- be in chicago and smile rather a large place in which to locate a stranger 
the re mainder of the amount send to -PRON- be now in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- fold the receipt and lay -PRON- with the other document 
that money be to be use for a purpose mr lorry -PRON- add 
what purpose 
i inquire 
-PRON- be to proceed to san francisco time -PRON- to arrive in that city on the twentyfifth of april 
when there go to the palace hotel 
three other will be there wait for -PRON- 
a a to four am to make -PRON- known to -PRON- 
yes 
i be properly at sea with all this -PRON- may be sure 
yet -PRON- life have be one which enable -PRON- to adapt -PRON- to the circumstance with comparative ease 
take a pencil and notebook from -PRON- pocket i ask for the name of those i to meet do not know the name of the three per son be the lawyer astounding answer 
-PRON- will be at the palace hotel san fran cisco on the twentyfifth and will be expect -PRON- take -PRON- then that -PRON- know -PRON- name and will make -PRON- know to -PRON- 
mr benson shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- do not know -PRON- name -PRON- proceed and will make -PRON- know to -PRON- by que tion and answer 
-PRON- may do the questioning or the other may do -PRON- 
the question be this what time be -PRON- 
the answer a quarter to four 
-PRON- may give the challenge or receive -PRON- and the response must be the one state 
this look like a lot of claptrap possibly lead e nowhere 
i exclaim 
a a to -PRON- possibly return mr benson 
be -PRON- a hoax 
rather an expensive one if -PRON- be donot -PRON- think 
-PRON- will take draw a small seal envelope from the large one and hand -PRON- to san francisco with -PRON- 
there be no address on the envelope no in formation of any kind 
unless instruct to the contrary say mr benson -PRON- will open that envelope at a private conference of the four after all of -PRON- have be identify 
this look to -PRON- like a lot of cumbrous ma chinery for evolve an infinitesimal result 
i say as much in a tone of pronounced depreca tion 
the lawyer mismatch eye survey -PRON- with weary impatience have do -PRON- part mr lorry -PRON- an nounced and -PRON- will either do -PRON- or leave -PRON- undo as -PRON- see fit 
good morning 
thereupon i leave the room the money in -PRON- pocket the seal envelope in the breast of -PRON- coat and -PRON- mind in a chaos of speculation as fruitless as -PRON- be exasperate 
zooke backward 
have -PRON- ever observe how hard luck when -PRON- once deal -PRON- a tell blow follow -PRON- up with another and another 
-PRON- be fortunate indeed if this observation be not bear of personal experi 11ce 
misfortune get past -PRON- guard with a blow that daze and bewilder proceed forth with to take advantage of -PRON- sorry condition and to smite -PRON- hip and thigh 
thus have the world go with -PRON- up to the very hour i have receive that letter summon -PRON- to the office of benson grime 
just before the letter come into -PRON- hand so grievously have i be worst by the blow of circumstance that i have begin to wonder if i be not down and out 
adversity be a rough road 
where -PRON- branch from the smooth and sunny thoroughfare of suc cess one can usually look back and see a sign board that be wrongly interpret 
for -PRON- uncle rufu stand at the parting of a a to four the way 
if -PRON- have be a little less inflexible if -PRON- have concern -PRON- a little more with -PRON- natural bent and have not seek to drive -PRON- into a vocation for which i be manifestly unfit perhaps i should not have awaken that bright spring morning in a humble hall bedroom with certain arrearage of board to meet and with only ten cent in -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- estatewhich with -PRON- have be leave to the care of uncle small amount e to about five thousand dollar 
yet if the world give atlas as much trouble as that money give uncle rufu then i be sorry for atlas 
uncle rufu want -PRON- to become a minister 
as i have absolutely no inclination that way -PRON- defer to the wanderlust that have take hold of -PRON- from -PRON- infancy and trim -PRON- desire to the more modest specification of a missionary 
-PRON- think that by wander in heathen part i could please -PRON- and that by evangel ise the heathen i could please -PRON- 
but still -PRON- pattern be too large for -PRON- cloth 
the crusoe spirit fasten upon -PRON- by virtue of a onesyllable edition which i sequester about the time i discard pinafore for short a a to four trouser 
from mariner -PRON- be an easy stage to gil bla and only a couple of step farther to the count of monte cristo and two year before the mast 
-PRON- readingroom while i live with uncle rufu be a corner of the haymow 
in the house -PRON- puritanical straightlaced guardian have lay out a noble library with book of martyr at the head for -PRON- especial benefit 
one day uncle rufu commend the zeal i display in imbibe the martyr only to look over -PRON- shoulder a little later and find jack harkaway snuggle among the leave 
from that moment -PRON- estrangement begin grow through the year to an ultimate separation 
i graduate from the high school at eighteen with an imagination that have win -PRON- the honor of class prophet 
-PRON- be a gallant effort i re member carve out fame and fortune for nine young man and woman and inasmuch as i leave every one of -PRON- in power and prominence -PRON- be heartily applaud 
i go home that night to find uncle rufu dally with a bonfire 
as i draw near i a a to four see -PRON- poke the last vestige of -PRON- haymow collection of literature into the flame 
-PRON- have word 
at midnight i steal away from the house leave great barrington and the dear old berkshire on the truck of a passenger train and in three day have ship as cabinboy on a tramp steamer bind for cape town 
how be a soldier of fortune launch upon -PRON- career 
in some such way as this i imagine provide the inclination to roam be strong enough to endure the hardship 
on the way to africa i have sailore curse and hammer into -PRON- 
no sooner be the tramp under the shadow of table mountain than i go overboard in the night and in due course reach bultfontein and the diamondfield 
look for bit of carbon in blue ground do not satisfy -PRON- and -PRON- be not long before i join a party that raid the boer get old england in no end of trouble and incidentally put -PRON- in hospital for a month 
when well enough i ship on a yankee trader for the south sea from the portuguese settlement 
-PRON- be needless to detail the eight year of knock e about 
soldier of fortune usually find cen a a to four tral america in -PRON- itinerary so quite naturally -PRON- drop into mine 
have i be on the right side of the con troversy the man who would have make -PRON- dictator of one of the state would have remember -PRON- substantially 
what a wealth of possibility be wrap up in those word would have and should have 
as -PRON- chance i be on the wrong side of that central american argument 
a handful of ragged fugitive get -PRON- into mexico in a ham mock swing between horse for i have be badly wound 
the fugitive leave -PRON- to die in the hut of a peon and with the peon -PRON- leave a big bag of silver dollar to pay for decent interment and to reward the peon for -PRON- trouble 
all -PRON- life long i have be disappoint peo ple so i disappoint the peon and begin to re cover 
when -PRON- see the bag of dollar slip away from -PRON- -PRON- gracious host try to finish the bullet work with a dirk 
-PRON- find -PRON- with more fight at -PRON- disposal than -PRON- have imagine and i escape with -PRON- dollar and -PRON- host burro ultimately reach a a to four the city of mexico 
still far from well a desire to get back into country take hold of -PRON- and i strike for the heart of -PRON- make the long railroad journey to chicago 
i would settle down i fondly persuade -PRON- self 
i be twentysix and -PRON- be high time 
eight year as a roll stone have leave -PRON- with moss enough to pay two week board in a humble south side boardinghouse 
i awake from -PRON- monte cristo dream and even the hum bler fortune of the irish con cregan fail to interest -PRON- 
i would look for a place to work 
i look for a month walk to save car fare during the last two week of the time 
-PRON- search be unsuccessful 
i could not keep book i could not write short hand i be not scholarly enough for a private tutor and have no reference for a position of trust 
no one in chicago want a man of such shine ability as i have develop 
as a last resort i try shovelwork in a sewer gang 
-PRON- spirit chafe because of -PRON- but -PRON- landlady mrs pynchon be become garrulous on the subject of a fortnight bill due and un pay 
a a ter to four the discovery that the wound in -PRON- side make shovelwork an impossibility be not particularly distress 
i draw -PRON- time at the end of an hour and with fifteen cent in -PRON- pocket walk from diversey street on the north side to twelfth street on the south 
-PRON- interview with mrs pynchon when i get back to the boardinghouse be of a nature that i hesitate to describe 
during -PRON- absence -PRON- have take possession of -PRON- grip have examine -PRON- at -PRON- leisure and have find -PRON- to contain a shortbladed machete a brace of revolver and a pair of puttee 
mrs pynchon be wroth indeed and in the morning i must pay or go 
-PRON- would keep the relic of -PRON- central american experience and sell -PRON- for what -PRON- could get 
i be think of all this as i lie in -PRON- bed that bright spring morning look out through the dusty windowpane 
should or should i not write to uncle rufu for an accounting 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that five thousand dollar properly invest for eight year should amount to quite a tidy sum 
many a time before i have think with longing of that money but senti a a to four mentfoolish if -PRON- willhad keep -PRON- from claim -PRON- 
-PRON- dream tenderly nurse for those eight year have be to return to great barrington possess of untold thousand thus prove com placently that i have open the oyster with -PRON- own good sword 
to demand an accounting of uncle rufu be tacitly to acknowledge defeatto admit -PRON- be right when -PRON- say during -PRON- last bitter interview that i would go -PRON- un bridle course and come to want 
for a man whose strong spirit pant for suc cess the acknowledgment of failure be gall 
even at a time when -PRON- fortune be at -PRON- low ebb i could not bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
yet i be beat 
lie there in that bed for whose hire mrs pynchon still stand on the credit side of -PRON- ledger i ponder the momentous question as to whether be down i be to be count out 
in the throe of -PRON- quandary a knock fall on the door 
mrs pynchon i think come to eject -PRON- 
but -PRON- be not mr pynchon 
-PRON- be betty a a ter to the maid and betty wonder of wonder have a letter for -PRON- 
that letter prove to be the brief document that carry -PRON- to the office of benson grime attorney the astonishing result of which call have already be chronicle 
i have never be very long in reach a de cision or in map out a policy for future en deavor 
with money for immediate need and travel expense -PRON- be not five minute after i leave the lawyer office before i have make up -PRON- mind to see the matter through 
thereupon i replenish -PRON- modest wardrobe with a new suit of clothe visit the barber and go back to mrs with the air of a prodigal who have come into -PRON- own 
nothing succeed like success unless now and then -PRON- be something that have the appearance of success 
mrs attitude veer with the favor wind and -PRON- hostility melt away in smile 
the roll of bill which i draw from -PRON- pocket in cancel -PRON- obligation appear to contain vastly more than -PRON- really do 
while -PRON- eye widen -PRON- morbid amiability increase 
a a to -PRON- be curious of course 
what woman would not have be in the circumstance 
-PRON- require all -PRON- tact to parry -PRON- indirect que tion without offend 
there be an embarrassing moment when -PRON- return -PRON- satchel but when i leave -PRON- give -PRON- a hearty handclasp and beg that i would not forget -PRON- house whenever i chance to be in the city 
forget -PRON- house 
not whether in the city or out of -PRON- 
the most discouraging period of -PRON- life have be pass in that thirdclass board ingplace on twelfth street 
that evening i start westward in a tourist sleeper equip with a seal envelope and a horological countersign more than halfcon vinced that i be want for some filibustering expedition 
the time o day 
the morning of april twentyfifth find -PRON- in the palace hotel in the city of the golden gate 
to particularize further the beginning of that eventful day find -PRON- in the great ro tunda with a weathereye out for swashbuckler of the filibustering type 
reflection during that long crosscountry jour ney have still further convince -PRON- as to the de sign back of -PRON- interview with mr benson 
the law have a heavy hand for filibuster outfit from a peaceable port hence the mystery that point -PRON- course and shroud -PRON- movement 
one detail alone mar the theory i have evolve 
sailor lodginghouse on the front should have be the scene of -PRON- questionable come together and not that magnificent hos telry 
big broadshouldered swag gerer with a thwartshiproll in -PRON- gait would surely be out of place in that splendid rotunda 
a a ter to through the curl wreath of -PRON- cigar i look for such person in vain 
may i trouble -PRON- for the correct time sir 
the word come like a thunderclap come from the depth of a sleepyhollow chair on -PRON- right 
i hoist up on one elbow for a sidewise stare 
a stout gentleman with smooth face and iron gray hair silkhatte and prosperously dressed have launch the question 
a morning paper lie across -PRON- knee and -PRON- be study the open face of -PRON- watch quarter to four say search the que tioner with a keen look 
the gentleman give a startled gasp counter e -PRON- glance with one of perplexity and alarm 
still hold -PRON- watch in -PRON- hand -PRON- struggle to -PRON- foot and make -PRON- way to the desk 
there -PRON- have some talk with the clerk both shoot covert look in -PRON- direction 
no doubt -PRON- consider -PRON- a fool or an idiot 
-PRON- be late in the forenoon and could not by any possibility have be a quarter to four 
-PRON- disgust be intense 
the shallow absurd ity of -PRON- position exasperate and mortify -PRON- 
red and perspiring i get out of -PRON- chair and a a to four go into the writingroom 
seat -PRON- in font of a desk i lean on -PRON- elbow and begin canvass the difficulty that have so suddenly pre sente -PRON- 
i have word for -PRON- that there be three person in that hotel who be as anxious to find -PRON- as i be to find -PRON- 
but there be many guest and if i go from one to another inquire the time of day -PRON- would not be long until -PRON- sanity be question and an officer call in 
-PRON- be console to know that there be three other place in a similar situation 
the ridicu lous aspect of the affair catch -PRON- finally and i laugh to -PRON- 
instead of wait for a challenge i would give one 
a yard away sit a middleage individual in a black silk skullcap -PRON- be write in dustriously 
pardon -PRON- say but could -PRON- tell -PRON- the time 
the man in the skullcap pause look toward -PRON- with a frown then jerk -PRON- head in the di rection of a clock that stare -PRON- in the face from a a to four an opposite wall 
there be no need of word and none be speak 
there be three other in the writingroom 
all have hear -PRON- query and if one of -PRON- have be in the plot certainly -PRON- would have signi fie -PRON- in some way and presently have come close enough to give -PRON- privately the correct answer 
after a brief wait during which nothing hap pen i get up and go away 
-PRON- disgust -PRON- be needless to say mount as failure multiply 
if a quartet of filibuster be to come together in that hotel why have not the guide mind speci fie green ribbon in coatlapel brickre neck tie or some other identification that would ap peal to the eye 
for get a man into trouble commend -PRON- a dozen time over to what -PRON- say rather than to what -PRON- see 
simple and inoffensive expedient -PRON- ap peare have be lay by 
a silly question and a brainless answer i must abide by these if i be to follow the matter to -PRON- legitimate con clusion 
lean against a marble column in the ro tunda i watch the people come and go across the mosaic floor linger at the desl or a a to four file away toward the elevator under convoy of the agile moneyseeker know as front 
idler in the sleepyhollow chair again undergo -PRON- scrutiny 
there be nothing at all promise in this ma terial 
no one trod the mosaic floor with knee bent as though to meet the heave of a deck no one bear the earmark of a filibuster idle in the big chair 
nevertheless that be the palace hotel and the day be the twentyfifth of april 
if i have be steer on a proper course there be three within sound of -PRON- voice who be as anxious to find -PRON- as i be to find -PRON- 
if from -PRON- post at that marble column i have dare shout -PRON- query as to the time o day no doubt the three miss one would have hear 
but i lack the hardihood for such initiative especially as a big clock with a dial like a full moon and hand and figure that could have be see a mile hang in plain view from every part of the rotunda 
from berate the extravagant machinery that be to lay -PRON- alongside the trio i have come to meet i fall to chafe at -PRON- helplessness 
leav a arter to four e the rotunda i go out to the sidewalk in front of the hotel 
the fresh air i think would clear -PRON- brain and settle -PRON- nerve 
market street be crowd with people 
a fruitgrower convention be in progress and the walk in front of the palace seem to be the rendezvous for a visit delegation 
i elbow -PRON- way into the throng decide that -PRON- be no place for any one not a fruitgrower and start to elbow -PRON- way out of -PRON- again 
a man collide with -PRON- and the next moment i prick up -PRON- ear at the query what time be -PRON- neighbor 
the voice be husky the man be bleareye and -PRON- ensemble be little well than that of a hoodlum 
by then i have learn to be cautious 
brace -PRON- against the ebb and flow of the human current i draw -PRON- watch from -PRON- vest 
while ostensibly study the face of -PRON- time piece i would scrutinize the face of -PRON- inter locutor 
if wariness could help -PRON- i would not place -PRON- in a false position again 
while i be debate whether i should give -PRON- inquirer the right time or the countersign -PRON- solve the que a art to ur tion by seize -PRON- watch and vanish into the crowd 
stop thief 
i shout and attempt pursuit 
on account of the jam however a successful pursuit be impossible 
after i have overturn half a dozen pedestrian and have be toss back and forth like a waterlogge hulk in the current i give up attempt to recover the watch and draw out of the press into the lady entrance of the hotel 
while i stand there pant and bewail -PRON- loss a cab push up to the curb and a lady alight 
-PRON- be a stout lady beyond middle age and with a motherly face 
-PRON- be neatly gown in black and -PRON- bonnet prove -PRON- a widow in mourning 
the cabby dismount from -PRON- box and hand -PRON- passenger an oldfashione carpetbag 
the hotel attach who look after the lady en trance be nowhere to be see and the stout lady survey the current of humanity between -PRON- and the hotel door with dismay 
that be a busy day with the cabby and -PRON- hurriedly mount -PRON- box and drive away leav e -PRON- fare on the curb 
i cease deplore the a a to loss of -PRON- watch descend the pair of step that lead to the lady entrance and push -PRON- way through the stream of fruitgrower 
do -PRON- wish to get into the hotel madam say halt at the stout ladys side 
-PRON- lift -PRON- motherly face to -PRON- forlornly hopeful 
if -PRON- please mister -PRON- answer a breath less catch in -PRON- voice 
sake alive what an awful crowd 
i take -PRON- carpetbag and request -PRON- to take -PRON- arm 
presently -PRON- gain the pair of marble step and mount to the hotel door all right now maam i observe in a cheery tone return the carpetbag much oblige to -PRON- say -PRON- grate fully be a long time since i be in a big town like this and that fluster with the noise and bustle i hardly know whether afoot or horseback 
could -PRON- -PRON- falter and a scared look cross -PRON- face 
if i can do anything more for -PRON- i say command -PRON- 
what time be -PRON- 
a a to four -PRON- gaze fixedly at -PRON- 
about eleven oclock i return wonder at -PRON- stare and -PRON- odd manner 
disappointment run through the line of -PRON- face 
thank -PRON- -PRON- say and turn away 
then i have a most amazing thought 
-PRON- may be a quarter to four i call after -PRON- 
by then -PRON- back be toward -PRON- and -PRON- be halfthrough the door 
the carpetbag drop and -PRON- clutch at the ornate doorknob to sup port -PRON- 
another moment and i be beside -PRON- again -PRON- find the other -PRON- ask 
not yet i answer 
in an hour be in one of the parlor on the second floor 
will -PRON- meet -PRON- there 
certainly say be mrs sarah brackett -PRON- add hesi tatingly offer -PRON- hand 
and i be robert lorry i answer take the hand encouragingly 
i pick up the carpetbag for -PRON- and -PRON- van a a ter to ishe into the marble corridor 
so here be one of -PRON- filibuster 
i want to laugh at find -PRON- so far afield but be too deeply mystified to treat the matter lightly 
what could i possibly have in common with that elderly lady 
there be no use bombard -PRON- with mental question 
the more i speculate the farther i find -PRON- at sea 
pass through the lady entrance i trav erse the corridor cross the receptionroom and ultimately gain the rotunda 
there i hunt out an unoccupied chair throw -PRON- in to -PRON- and continue -PRON- reflection 
this initial success be follow quickly by another 
while busy with -PRON- thought -PRON- eye absently follow the people who be come and go around -PRON- 
a young man fix -PRON- passive attention 
-PRON- be slight of form with carroty hair buttermilk eye and a wisp of down on -PRON- upper lip 
-PRON- forehead and chin be of the retreat variety give -PRON- face a birdlike contour in fact as -PRON- flutter about the rotunda -PRON- remind -PRON- of a nervous tomtit 
a arter to -PRON- -PRON- narrow chest and thin leg be incase in garment of an ultrafashionable sort 
-PRON- wear lightyellow glove lightyellow spat and carry a rattan cane 
the young man belong to a class that have never appeal to -PRON- 
yet curiosity pull -PRON- out of -PRON- reflection as i watch -PRON- 
begin at one end of a row of lounger -PRON- would flutter to the other end of the row halt e at every third man to bend over and say some thing 
when -PRON- pass on the lounger would exchange look and significant grin and a fore head would be tap suggestively 
the young man work -PRON- way nearer to where i sit 
presently -PRON- come close enough so i could hear what -PRON- be say 
-PRON- be ask the time of day go about the work with systematic thoroughness and with utter disregard for appearance 
i get up step over to -PRON- and take -PRON- by the arm 
-PRON- friend say have -PRON- find any one yet who tell -PRON- that -PRON- be a quarter to four 
find -PRON- gasp 
by jove 
-PRON- shift the rattan from -PRON- right to -PRON- left hand and drop the right hand on -PRON- arm 
a a ter to four fancy -PRON- go on with a vacuous grin think -PRON- may be a joke 
as i gaze at -PRON- and think of the elderly lady upstairs in the parlor i be not altogether certain that -PRON- be not still a joke 
have -PRON- find the other two -PRON- whis pere explosively have find one of -PRON- i answer have work -PRON- way through the rotunda this far -PRON- proceed and suppose -PRON- keep on 
-PRON- go to the right and go to the left so no i return firmly before -PRON- be half do an officer would be call in and -PRON- would be car rie off to some institution for the feebleminded 
what be -PRON- name -PRON- friend 
chauncey vandeleur 
and your 
robert lorry say lorry what s -PRON- all about 
i havenot the least idea donot -PRON- know 
neither have i respond dryly 
come upstairs with -PRON- and introduce -PRON- to the third person of -PRON- distinguished quartet 
but i say -PRON- demur get to find the fourth 
a a to four the three of -PRON- will discuss that point i go on 
if this be really a joke i want to make sure of -PRON- and wash -PRON- hand of the entire matter 
chauncey vandeleur follow -PRON- to the ele vator 
when -PRON- reach the secondfloor parlor -PRON- find mrs sarah brackett in animate con versation with a young ladya slend hand some girl of twentytwo or twentythree 
as vandeleur and i come close mrs brackett start up with a look of undisguised pleasure 
mr lorry -PRON- exclaim 
let -PRON- make -PRON- acquaint with miss zelda anstruther 
i just ask -PRON- what time -PRON- be and -PRON- tell -PRON- here the elderly ladys voice sink to an awe some -PRON- be a quarter to four 
the color mount to miss cheek as i gaze at -PRON- 
by jove chirrup vandeleur 
this be what i call luck donot -PRON- know 
instantly i revise -PRON- opinion as to the whole affair be a joke 
the beautiful miss an struther -PRON- may be be responsible for the re vision 
an odd enterprise 
this mysterious business have nothing to do with filibustering that be sure 
a motherly old lady a fair slip of a girl a youth with a simian facial anglethese three be out of any picture that have a background of lawlessness on the high sea or in the southern americas 
the thought come to -PRON- that -PRON- be a set of pinktea conspirator bring together perhaps to plan a missionary campaign on the mosquito coast 
yet even so miss hazel eye reconcile -PRON- to whatever the fate hold in i present vandeleur 
mrs brackett eye -PRON- indulgently and sympathetically miss an struther with curiosity and some small amount of tolerance 
vandeleur and i seat -PRON- 
find that -PRON- be alone in the parlor -PRON- at once go into executive session 
-PRON- have be strangely bring together page a a to four say in pursuance of some design of whose nature i have not the slight knowledge 
can any of -PRON- enlighten -PRON- 
silence follow the query 
four pair of eye fence anxiously and fall in disappointment havenot the least notion what -PRON- all about mr lorry speak up mrs sarah brackett from emmetsburg ioway -PRON- and come on here because a lawyer by the name of cart wright advise -PRON- to 
mr cartwright couldnot tell -PRON- much 
-PRON- just hand -PRON- two hundred dollar say i be to be at the palace hotel in san francisco on the twentyfifth and go around ask what time -PRON- be until i have find three who say -PRON- be a quarter to four 
i havenot trav ele a great deal and i hate anything that s not free and aboveboard so i think long and hard before i conclude to take the trip 
mr cart wright say better come 
-PRON- know -PRON- hus band ezry and -PRON- boy tom and -PRON- s always be a good friend to -PRON- mr cartwright have 
the wrinkle lip quiver and the faded blue eye grow frankly tearful 
miss anstruther draw -PRON- chair closer to mrs and take one of -PRON- hand in both -PRON- own 
a a to four havenot get ezry no more and i havenot get tom continue mrs brackett lean toward the girl just a poor old woman with neither chick nor child i can call -PRON- own and i havenot enough money to hardly keep -PRON- out of the coun ty house 
that two hundred dollar look like a small fortune to -PRON- and i hate to spend -PRON- on what may turn out a wildgoose chase to san francisco 
but mr cartwright say come and keep say -PRON- and i didnot make up -PRON- mind till the last minute here now and thank ful to know i didnot have much trouble ask that foolish question and get the foolish an swer 
i wonder if -PRON- all feel about -PRON- like i do miss anstruther press the wrinkled hand -PRON- be hold be sure i do mrs brackett say -PRON- have wait in this parlor all morning without courage to put the question 
when -PRON- come and ask -PRON- the time i feel as though i be go to faint 
-PRON- smile a little and barely glance in -PRON- direction 
yet -PRON- go on see how easily -PRON- meeting have come about 
-PRON- find -PRON- and mr lorry find mr vandeleur and a a ter to bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- have come from iowa mrs brackett but i have come all the way from new york and i hadand still have for that matteras little confidence in the outcome as -PRON- have -PRON- 
-PRON- experience be similar to -PRON- too lawyer write and request -PRON- to call upon -PRON- 
-PRON- give -PRON- two hundred dollar tell -PRON- substantially what -PRON- lawyer tell -PRON- and i be several day consider the matter 
i be stenographer for a law firm in liberty hay 
i lay the matter before mr and -PRON- advise -PRON- to follow the tip as -PRON- call -PRON- and see what -PRON- amount to 
if the business come to nothing i be to return to new york and have -PRON- old place back 
thereupon i give -PRON- experience which paral lele those of mrs brackett and miss an struther 
then -PRON- three direct -PRON- glance at vandeleur 
deucedly odd exclaim the young man with a smirk at miss anstruther which cause that young lady to avert -PRON- eye live right here in frisco donot -PRON- know and get a letter from a lawyer chap just like miss anstruther a arter to four and mr lorry 
i call on -PRON- and be jolly well surprised when -PRON- hand -PRON- a wad of greenback and tell -PRON- to call at the palace on the twentyfifth and go around ask different people what time -PRON- be 
here -PRON- all be though and what s to be do 
the buttermilk eye fix -PRON- on -PRON- shrewdly 
do any of -PRON- receive a seal envelope 
i inquire 
all of -PRON- have be wary -PRON- seem and have hold the matter of the seal envelope back wait e for a cue to mention -PRON- 
straightway four envelope identically alike be bring into view 
no doubt i proceed these envelope have an important bearing upon the case 
-PRON- lawyer instruct -PRON- that the envelope be to be open when -PRON- four come together 
mr cartwright say the same thing an nounced mrs brackett 
and so do the lawyer i visit in new york aver miss anstruther 
-PRON- instruction be different say vande leur 
as soon as -PRON- find each other the law a a to four yer here say -PRON- be to call on -PRON- and -PRON- would tell -PRON- what to do with -PRON- envelope 
i reflect upon this point 
-PRON- be the only de tail in which -PRON- legal adviser have differ 
who be -PRON- lawyer mr vandeleur 
i in terrogate 
mr price of price green garnett 
be -PRON- office far from here 
not more than two block 
would -PRON- be likely to find -PRON- in -PRON- office now call -PRON- up on the phone mr lorry and see if -PRON- be there 
-PRON- soon find that mr price be in -PRON- of fice and would receive -PRON- so -PRON- leave the hotel -PRON- be mediately and call on -PRON- 
the lawyer be a big florid man and meet -PRON- with a grim smile 
vandeleur introduce -PRON- and mr price offer -PRON- chair and close the door of -PRON- private room 
-PRON- all have -PRON- envelope -PRON- ask 
-PRON- produce the envelope 
very good -PRON- go on keep -PRON- carefully and do not let -PRON- get out of -PRON- possession for a minute 
if one be lose this whole proceeding would result in a fiasco 
i can not tell -PRON- what the business be a a to four because i do not know 
naturally however i be conversant with a few detail and i know that a matter of prime importance be for -PRON- to hold fast to -PRON- envelope 
i have -PRON- on the good authority that this will mean much to -PRON- perhaps a fortune fortune murmur mrs brackett start e upright in -PRON- chair fortune echo miss anstruther staring 
by jove exclaim vandeleur 
i smile skeptically 
rather an odd way to distribute a fortune donot -PRON- think mr price say oh yes -PRON- answer but indirect method may be necessary 
-PRON- four be to charter a sea go vessel man and provision for a long voyage 
when -PRON- be three day out on a west erly course -PRON- will hold a private conference on the boat and open -PRON- envelope 
-PRON- content will give -PRON- -PRON- destination and other needful instruction 
charter a vessel 
i cry startle 
embark for a long voyage with only the content of four unopened envelope to warrant the undertaking 
mr price wave -PRON- hand admit -PRON- be ask a a to four e a good deal of four people bring together in the strange way that -PRON- have be -PRON- vouch safed 
however -PRON- may be in -PRON- power to give -PRON- more confidence in the undertaking 
-PRON- take a paper from a pigeonhole in -PRON- desk and slowly open -PRON- 
do any of -PRON- know a person name arthur mayhew -PRON- ask 
-PRON- be -PRON- cousin i speak up 
archibald anstruther pursue the lawyer 
-PRON- brother falter miss anstruther 
-PRON- be in the army andand disappear 
thomas brackett intone the lawyer son murmur mrs brackett fumble for -PRON- blackbordered handkerchief 
-PRON- be a soldier too and kill in chiny 
leastways -PRON- hasnot be hear of for moren a year andand give -PRON- up 
eugene trent continue the lawyer 
by jove cry vandeleur mine 
an uncle of a fat lot i ever care for -PRON- 
if -PRON- charter a boat and put to sea say mr price the four i have mention will be -PRON- authority for so do 
-PRON- will know bet a a to four ter than i whether -PRON- would have any intent to deceive -PRON- or to cause -PRON- needless expense 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther have -PRON- handkerchief to -PRON- eye 
vandeleur be ab sently roll a cigarette 
i sit in -PRON- chair with a bewilder brain 
where be the money to come from for char tere the boat mr price 
i inquire 
-PRON- four will have to settle that question among -PRON- -PRON- respond 
no fund have be deposit for that purpose havenot a penny come tremulously from mrs brackett but if i be to go somewhere and find -PRON- boy tom i will find a way 
so will declare miss anstruther with fine determination if -PRON- brother be call for -PRON- to come to -PRON- 
uncle gene can go to ballyhack for all of -PRON- grumble vandeleur havenot a cent to pay for a seavoyage anyhow 
-PRON- say some thing about a fortune mr price 
by jove that s a different proposition from go -PRON- blind to find uncle gene 
there be a big reward in the business for all a a to four of -PRON- reassure the lawyer provide -PRON- follow -PRON- up 
what be -PRON- to do 
miss anstruther put the question and all eye appear to focus on -PRON- 
-PRON- shall find a way say -PRON- will go back to the hotel for luncheon and discuss way and mean immediately afterward 
-PRON- have nothing more to tell -PRON- mr price 
not a thing except to say that i wish -PRON- all the good luck imaginable 
i start out with the other but the lawyer call -PRON- back 
when -PRON- and i be alone and with the door close -PRON- take -PRON- by a button con fidentially 
-PRON- original instruction contemplate the opening of the envelope in the hotel here do -PRON- not mr lorry -PRON- query 
yes i answer take -PRON- upon -PRON- to change that 
van deleur i find have not a very good character 
all this complicated machinery which -PRON- think so odd and uncalled for be ingeniously devise to keep one of -PRON- four from obtain an advan tage over the other and use -PRON- unfairly 
if the a a to four envelope be open at sea vandeleur if so dis pose can do nothing to backcap -PRON- plan 
do -PRON- rise to that think so say there be two estimable lady in -PRON- party if i be any judge of character and -PRON- will fall upon -PRON- mr lorry as the most able and re sourceful to safeguard the lady interest 
keep an eye on vandeleur that s all 
-PRON- have nothing more to tell mepri vately 
no 
i wish on -PRON- soul that i know more but i donot 
do -PRON- know of any one who would care to advance money for charter a ship receive back twice over the amount invest 
once more -PRON- smile grimly do not -PRON- return 
-PRON- would be a pre carious investment this put up expense for a quartet of rainbowchaser 
but -PRON- say never mind what i say 
i read off to -PRON- certain name and those name impress the four of -PRON- 
-PRON- and -PRON- three companion know the person name and that should give a a to four -PRON- confidence but -PRON- would hardly impress an outsider 
with that -PRON- bid -PRON- a good day and i leave -PRON- office 
i have be sadly tangle on leave the chamber of commerce building after -PRON- inter view with mr benson but that state of mind wasnot a circumstance to the one i carry with -PRON- on leave mr price 
an unexpected assault 
this then be the condition of affair to go forward in the strange business that have bring -PRON- to san francisco -PRON- must have moneyenough to charter a boat for a long cruise 
-PRON- starchamber session in the parlor of the palace hotel immediately after luncheon de velope the very important fact that vandeleur have no fund and no credit 
from what mrs brackett have say indirectly i know that -PRON- could be of no financial help and miss anstruther assure -PRON- tearfully that -PRON- be in like circum that place the brunt of -PRON- at -PRON- door and send -PRON- thought eastward to uncle rufu and to -PRON- patrimony that have be gather bulk through the year 
should i hazard -PRON- all on a lawyer word that -PRON- cousin arthur mayhew vouch for the enterprise 
i have never see arthur mayhew more than a art to once in -PRON- life 
-PRON- have live in the middle west whither -PRON- relative on the spindle side have emigrate and a wellearned reputation for be wild have restrain uncle rufu from invite -PRON- to great barrington 
when i be seventeen however arthur drop in on -PRON- without an invitation 
-PRON- be two year -PRON- senior have beat -PRON- way over a good part of the world and i like -PRON- -PRON- be mensely 
but -PRON- be a good deal of a rake and uncle rufu pack -PRON- off before -PRON- have be with -PRON- a fortnight 
the instinct of a soldier of fortune push -PRON- toward the risk 
what be a few thousand compare with an adventure that promise ex citement and much gain 
that would draw miss anstruther and -PRON- into close companionship for several month 
this latter consideration have a good deal of weight with -PRON- 
from what little i have see of the girl i like -PRON- immensely 
-PRON- be of course take the word of mr price for everything 
and mr price be not only as ignorant as -PRON- of the object of the a a to four undertaking but -PRON- optimism would not carry -PRON- the length of take stock in -PRON- 
by some psychological turn mrs brackett and miss anstruther have form the conviction that the former son and the latter brother be to be find at the end of this weird coil 
hence -PRON- be feverishly eager to embark and put to accord to vandeleur eugene trent be skipper of the brigantine ga aelle 
-PRON- be a shady mariner and although san francisco be -PRON- home port the gazelle have not be see in the bay for three year 
vandeleur would have tramp barefoot around the world to get any money uncle gene have leave but -PRON- would not have walk around the block to discover whether uncle gene be alive or dead 
before -PRON- afternoon conference come to an end i offer to charter and provision a small seagoing boat if one could be have on reasonable term 
i add however that -PRON- would possibly be a fortnight before i could get at -PRON- money and suggest that -PRON- remove to some respect able but less pretentious hotel where the charge a a ter to four would be more in keep with -PRON- circum miss anstruther look -PRON- gratitude and mrs brackett catch -PRON- hand and thank -PRON- tremulously 
there be a fortune to be gain say miss anstruther and -PRON- three companion would see that i be well repay for the pre liminary outlay 
miss anstruther also suggest that inasmuch as i be to finance the enterprise the entire man agement should be leave in -PRON- hand 
i should be -PRON- leader and -PRON- would trust every detail to -PRON- implicitly 
mrs brackett heartily agree to this but van deleur balk 
i have an idea that -PRON- want to captain -PRON- undertaking -PRON- 
in proof of -PRON- confidence mrs brackett and miss anstruther offer -PRON- -PRON- envelope for safekeepe 
i demur but -PRON- insist 
finally i yield ask only that each write -PRON- name across the flap of the envelope before giv e -PRON- to -PRON- 
vandeleur watch this proceeding with frank disapproval 
then of a sudden -PRON- attitude change and -PRON- aver fulsomely that the lady a a to four have do exactly the right thing 
a man -PRON- as serte be better able to safeguard the important document than a woman and if i could take care of three of the envelope certainly -PRON- could take care of one of -PRON- 
vandeleur state further that -PRON- have some ac quaintance with seafarer of the barbary coast and could introduce -PRON- to just the skip per -PRON- want for -PRON- requirement 
i be like vandeleur less and less the more i see of -PRON- 
i thank -PRON- a bit curtly for -PRON- offer aver that i have some acquaintance on the coast -PRON- and would begin that very evening look for a man to help -PRON- 
that afternoon -PRON- begin lop off expense by remove to a modest but entirely respectable hotel in kearney street and by eight in the eve ning i have start for the waterfront with one logy bill in -PRON- mind eye 
logy bill i suppose stand for about all that be bad in one of the bad quarter of that metropolis 
but i have pull logy bill clear of a stout sailorman arm with a dirk some year before and bill have swear undying friendship on the strength of -PRON- 
a a ter to i know logy bill could help -PRON- find a proper skipper and a proper boat 
-PRON- positive power for evil be as great as -PRON- negative power for good and i be go to approach -PRON- on -PRON- negative side 
bill would tell -PRON- which skipper be to be rely on and which be not and from the former class i would pick the man i want 
-PRON- be an early hour for the waterfront yet darkness have settle down and i be sufficiently wary to keep the middle of the road 
hull and mast rise starkly from the mirk that edge the wharf as i reach the front and turn along the coast 
dull light shine through the window of sailorrobbe den but for the most part the den be steep in prophetic silence 
-PRON- would waken into raucous life later on and by that time i hope to have accomplish -PRON- mis sion and to be back to kearney street 
presently i come to the squat little house where i have once sit out a reminiscent evening and smoke half a dozen pipe with logy bill 
mount the gloomy veranda i rap on the door 
the summon be answer by a frowsy look chinaman 
a arter to mr william at home 
i inquire 
lamplight from somewhere back of the china man cast a glow over the veranda 
the slant eye give -PRON- a catlike sizing 
what manner fashion -PRON- come hey in quire the domestic with elaborate care 
why -PRON- wantee logy bill 
-PRON- all same friend savvy 
be bill in the house 
-PRON- not in house 
where be -PRON- 
plap ovel town plap makee bizness up stleet 
no can tell 
will -PRON- be back soon can tell makee onepiecee papertalk -PRON- givee bill 
savvy 
can do 
with that i scribble a line on the blank leaf of a notebook request logy bill to call on -PRON- at -PRON- kearney street headquarters the fol lowing morning 
the chinaman take the note and close the door and i stumble from the ve randa halfblinde by the sudden shutting off of the lamplight 
a a to four twenty foot bring -PRON- opposite the mouth of an alley 
-PRON- eyesight clear suddenly and i be come aware that a man have leap out of the blackness of the alley and be stand in front of -PRON- 
the fellow stand stiffly erect bar -PRON- path 
without a word i attempt to go around -PRON- but -PRON- shift -PRON- position 
what do -PRON- want 
i demand 
for answer -PRON- right fist dart toward -PRON- 
expect a hostile move i jump back and evade the fist 
thereupon two arm go around -PRON- from be hind pin -PRON- hand to -PRON- body 
the en circle arm be like steel and the pressure -PRON- exert drive the breath from -PRON- lung 
on leave kearney street i have have the fore thought to slip a revolver into -PRON- pocket but the attack from behind have come before i could get at the weapon 
instantly i begin a fierce strug gle kick at -PRON- captor shin and wriggle like an eel to free -PRON- 
git the letter come a husky and impatient voice from behind three of -PRON- 
be thus apprise of the object of the at a a to four tack -PRON- desperate struggle become more fierce and determined 
i yell as i fight 
the man behind curse -PRON- roundly 
put a stopper on be jawtackle -PRON- pant 
look alive now a cleancut smashing blow on the side of -PRON- face daze -PRON- 
-PRON- limb go limp for a few moment and i lie like a sack of meal in the arm that hold -PRON- 
the man in front bent over fumble at the breast of -PRON- coat 
strength rush back to -PRON- then and i lift -PRON- foot and plant -PRON- in the pit of the fellow stomach 
the rogue fall away staggering and catch -PRON- breath 
the other man fling -PRON- to the ground with an oath and i see -PRON- jerk a knife from -PRON- pocket 
before the knife could fall a third form lurch out of the darkness and i hear the sodden impact of a fist follow by the clatter of a blade on the stone 
a timely arrival 
i be on -PRON- knee when the two who have at tack -PRON- pull -PRON- together and take to -PRON- heel 
the man whose timely appearance have turn the tide come close and lift -PRON- to -PRON- foot tight squeak mate -PRON- volunteer but thing like that be happenin here continual 
well if -PRON- isnot logy bill -PRON- 
i ex claim recognize the hairy thickset dump ling of a man who be range alongside of -PRON- think be square now bill i add gro pe for -PRON- breast pocket and make sure the three envelope be safe 
dash if -PRON- ainot bob lorry 
william thrust out -PRON- hand 
whenever do -PRON- blow into frisco lorry 
and whatever be ye do around here go back to -PRON- house bill and tell -PRON- a little business on hand and want -PRON- a a to -PRON- help 
in fact i be just leave -PRON- place when those two swab run afoul of -PRON- 
do -PRON- lift any plunder belong to -PRON- 
no -PRON- arrive in time to prevent that 
lucky thing for -PRON- that -PRON- stow -PRON- glad i happen around 
-PRON- be that yell o yourn that fetch -PRON- 
william be usually a man of slow and de liberate movement as befit one of -PRON- build but -PRON- have be quick enough that night 
-PRON- get back in the house and the chinaman bring a wet towel for -PRON- bruised face and serve -PRON- with cigar -PRON- also gravely present -PRON- mas ter with the note i have leave 
william spell the write word through carefully 
by come when i do -PRON- remark reckon i save -PRON- a trip to kearney street 
-PRON- do more than that bill i aver -PRON- keep -PRON- out of the morgue as maybe lorry 
ye know the rope hereabout so -PRON- sort o humorous seeing ye catch like that 
-PRON- idea of humor doesnot exactly jibe with -PRON- own bill i laugh 
a arter to four for half an hour -PRON- chat on various gen eral topic and then as -PRON- light fresh cigar i broach the business i have in mind 
what i want bill say be to charter a good seaworthy little boat 
the skipper must be straight and a man i can depend on 
the sort o skipper i deal with be genrally a bit offcolor -PRON- grin although the good of -PRON- donot object to a shanghaied man or two in the focsle 
where be this craft ye want to go wonot be able to tell that until be two or three day at sea 
-PRON- look at -PRON- with -PRON- bulletlike eye atwinkle 
and still yere after a good clean skipper 
the like o -PRON- ainot give to makin such cruise 
first off -PRON- will ask where -PRON- bind for 
then know say -PRON- and the straight skipper trip -PRON- anchor and bear away with an idee that -PRON- be shady andll bear watch e 
see how -PRON- be lorry honest business nevertheless i persist 
-PRON- ought to know -PRON- well enough to be sure of that william 
how long a vyage -PRON- ask speculatively 
a a ter to four several canot tell exactly 
logy bill smoke and reflect 
any skipper -PRON- comment finally undertake such a vyage will have a yaller streak in -PRON- somer something -PRON- get to ex pect lorry and guide -PRON- accord 
any passenger besides -PRON- 
four passenger all tell 
two be lady and i want good accommodation for -PRON- 
-PRON- raise -PRON- bushy eyebrow and give -PRON- a queer look 
when i say lady i go on mean ex actly that reckon -PRON- know -PRON- business lorry and i ainot no hand to pry into thing as donot con cern -PRON- but petticoat be pretty much in the way on everything but liner and yacht 
small boat like what -PRON- want not have no passenger li cense these here ladiesll sign on as stewardess i take -PRON- and -PRON- and toth man will go as fourth and fifth mate 
something like that i suppose easy fix 
the lady be along that ought to satisfy any skipper -PRON- ainot up to anything unlawful 
still -PRON- a handicap leav a a to four e port without know where -PRON- be bind the paper read 
-PRON- can read honolulu 
-PRON- head westerly on leave the gate send -PRON- some one in a day or two 
-PRON- can take the skipper measure hire -PRON- if -PRON- want to and if -PRON- donot want to turn -PRON- down and have another try 
in this way that part of the business be set tled 
i stay with william an hour longer and when i leave -PRON- friend accompany -PRON- as far as market street 
late as -PRON- be when i get back to the hotel i write and post a letter to uncle rufu re quest an immediate draft for the fund of mine which -PRON- have in -PRON- keeping 
then when i turn in i give serious thought to the principal event of the evening 
two man have waylay -PRON- and make an attempt to get the three envelope i be carry in -PRON- pocket 
how do those two man know i have the enve lope and why be the attack make 
there be but a single answer embrace in the one word vandeleur 
beyond all doubt a arter to four chauncey vandeleur be prove true to mr estimate of -PRON- 
i recall sudden change of front after mrs brackett and miss anstruther have pass -PRON- -PRON- envelope 
then and there be bear -PRON- design to secure the three document at one stroke add the three to the fourth which -PRON- -PRON- carry and thus have the entire matter in -PRON- own hand 
vandeleur have be quick to act 
i would not have believe that -PRON- retreat forehead hide so much resourcefulness 
courage in the deed there be none merely a snakelike craftiness in persuade other to -PRON- lawless will 
yes vandeleur be a man to be reckon with 
whatever the seabusiness that be to claim -PRON- attention clearly -PRON- would take the content of the four envelope to make -PRON- understandable 
one envelope would not do nor two envelope nor three 
the mystery be divide in quarter quarter make the whole and the whole would give the solution 
in that hour i give mental deference to the one who have devise the scheme for give each a a ter to four of -PRON- four what may be -PRON- just due 
to suc ceed -PRON- must all work together 
-PRON- would be impossible for -PRON- to call vande leur to account for the night work 
if -PRON- need -PRON- envelope -PRON- be none the less true that -PRON- need -PRON- envelope 
no the fellow must be bear with somehow until the four envelope have work out the theoretical part of -PRON- prob lem 
during the practical demonstration of -PRON- i could handle -PRON- without glove 
perhaps -PRON- be three oclock when i go to sleep 
if i be not mistaken that be the hour chime by a distant bell before i doze off 
when i awake -PRON- be a bluff knock on the door that bring -PRON- upright in -PRON- bed 
the sun flood the room and in a moment that far away clock begin toll the hour 
-PRON- last wake memory be of that bell 
i count the stroke one two three and so on up to eleven 
evidently i have secure -PRON- proper allotment of sleep 
the last echo of the bell be take up by re peated clamor at the door there 
i demand get -PRON- foot on the floor 
boy from the office sir come the response 
a arter to gentleman to see wait down stair 
who be -PRON- 
captain golden sir 
-PRON- say mr william send -PRON- 
tell captain golden that be down in a few minute say logy bill have be active enough in find a skipper for -PRON- 
captain golden eh 
i say to -PRON- as i get into -PRON- clothe 
that name be a good oman for a quartet of fortunehunter i must say 
a search for a ship 
when i reach the office the boy lead -PRON- to an corner where captain gold en be wait 
-PRON- be puff at one of those long crudely roll weed which pass by the name of stogie 
as i approach -PRON- pull the stogy from between -PRON- tooth and get slowly to -PRON- foot 
i find -PRON- some six foot of a man in a dingy cap wear blue pilotcloth coat with brass but ton dungaree trouser and seaboot 
judge from -PRON- rig -PRON- last voyage have not be pro perous 
the captain and i survey each other as the distance lessen between -PRON- 
follow a first comprehensive look -PRON- eye seek -PRON- face and dwelt there 
-PRON- be a lean strong face brown and weather beat as become a man of the sea 
a green patch cover the left eye 
the other eye be steelblue and glisteningkeen enough appar a a ter to four ently to do service for -PRON- and -PRON- defunct mate 
in the forehead above the green patch there be a dent not at all pretty to look at 
a red torpedo beard bristle from the low jaw 
the hair overlong and fringe the bottom of the cap be of even a more pronounced red than the beard 
red hair for fighter be -PRON- mental com ment not difficult to account for that miss e eye or the concavity above -PRON- 
then aloud captain golden 
i query 
the same -PRON- return extend a hand that carry but three finger and a thumb 
mr robert lorry i take -PRON- 
exactly 
i look around 
the boy have disappear and -PRON- could be quite by -PRON- in the corner 
i draw up a chair as the skipper seat -PRON- 
-PRON- come from mr william i understand the idea as the man say 
-PRON- say -PRON- want to hire a boat do 
what sort of a boat have -PRON- 
the lady may finest twosticker that ever sail out o frisco 
jam er on the wind an 7o a a to four shell show -PRON- heel to anything under canvas as the man say -PRON- size 
hunnerd an fifty ton 
where be -PRON- 
alongside pier twelve on the front -PRON- condition 
j be clean paint an overhauled 
everything spick an span from truck to keelson 
-PRON- be sealin last trip but shell never go agin 
i be two month gettin the smell out o -PRON- as sweet as a rose now an i ainot afeare to show er to nobody pay -PRON- a visit at one oclock captain 
if the boat suit -PRON- well go into matter a little and perhaps -PRON- can do business answer captain golden 
pi twelve be the place and -PRON- will find -PRON- aboard when -PRON- get there 
-PRON- touch a match to the end of -PRON- stogy get under weigh and roll the length of the office and out at the door 
-PRON- talk fair enough and have the look of a skipper who know how to do thing 
have miss breakfast i be among the a a ter to four first to go in to dinner when the diningroom door be throw open 
style and a scale of price to match make all the difference between a light repast at noon and a square meal and what be luncheon at the palace be a regular dinner there in kearney street 
i have finish and leave the hotel before mrs brackett and miss anstruther come into the di ningroom 
-PRON- be just as well 
when i next see the lady perhaps i could report that a skip per and a boat have be secure 
i have no difficulty in pick up the lady may even before i have see the gilt letter across the stern 
-PRON- lie at -PRON- mooring softly rub -PRON- fender against the plank 
approach from the south and before turn e upon the pier i be able to take in the craft length and height along the starboard side 
-PRON- be dazzlingly fresh in a coat of new paint -PRON- deck be scrub to snowy whiteness -PRON- stay whip and tarred mast and boom new slush brasswork glittering and all run gear coil down trimly 
from stem to taffrail i should judge that -PRON- measure full ninety foot 
-PRON- have a bow like a a a ter to four knifes edge and a run that seem incapable of draw a bucketful of dead water after -PRON- in a day sail 
-PRON- mast be rake and so high that i think the schooner must be crank 
a glance at the beam however dispel the impression 
i stroll along and gain the pier -PRON- gaze still travel over the boat 
i be already in love with -PRON- and hope in -PRON- soul that captain golden and i may come to term 
-PRON- good girl mr lorry call a voice 
what do -PRON- think o -PRON- 
i look around and see the skipper stand at the top of a gangplank aft as pretty as a belle in -PRON- good bib and tucker i answer heartily 
-PRON- be a gentleman yacht once before -PRON- fall into -PRON- hand an took to trading 
come aboard sir be over -PRON- with a tooth brush an shell stand close inspection 
i cross the plank and captain golden lead -PRON- to the focsle where the inspection begin 
the be a commodious place with twelve bunkssix on a side in two tier -PRON- complement captain 
i inquire 
a a ter to ur master mate six hand cook an cabinboy 
on -PRON- way aft from the -PRON- have a look in at the galley and then descend the after companion to the cabin 
this latter room be a marvel of maple gilt and mahogany 
the captain room and mate room open off the port side of the cabin while two door to starboard lead to stateroom 
the stateroom naturally be small yet each be neatly fur nishe and have double berth 
such an undue proportion of cabin space for ward and aft bespoke the yacht 
as the captain and i seat -PRON- for a business talk i no tice a rack against the cabin bulkhead with half a dozen wincester rifle well armed captain golden i ob serve -PRON- gaze drop from the rack to the skipper glitter blue eye 
as the man say -PRON- answer with a slight grin always well for the afterguard to be prepare for emergency 
i never go hunt for trouble but -PRON- can bet always prepare an donot dodge any 
do logy bill tell -PRON- anything about the sort of cruise be go to start on 
a a to four nary a whisper 
where be -PRON- go and how long do -PRON- expect to be go donot know where i be blue eye flicker and halfclosedand consequently i canot tell how long well be go 
most remarkable be dry response 
do -PRON- happen to know mr lorry whether -PRON- business be straight or crooked 
i straighten stiffly 
beggin -PRON- pardon an no offense mean go on golden 
mayhap -PRON- know logy reputation 
-PRON- send -PRON- to forget that honest work captain golden say i sharply 
boat have sail under seal order before i take -PRON- and havenot do anything pi ratical either 
seal order -PRON- exclaim suck in -PRON- breath and -PRON- eye glimmering 
so that s the lay of -PRON- hey 
when do -PRON- open -PRON- order 
three day westward of the gate different 
i draw the line at pearlin among jap island or smuggling chink or pop pyjuice into the state or arm an ammunition out of -PRON- 
if -PRON- straight good and only a mat a a to four ter o learn -PRON- destination three day out why as the man say -PRON- huckleberry 
long vyage 
several month possibly 
that suit -PRON- uncommon 
the long the time the big the lay 
any passenger besides -PRON- 
three two of -PRON- ladie 
-PRON- jump at that and begin to look dubious 
mebby -PRON- know how -PRON- be at sea mr lorry -PRON- observe 
now an agin -PRON- have to use lan guage which the hand understand 
think the ladiesll object to that 
give -PRON- personally all the consideration -PRON- can say and i think -PRON- will be satisfied 
this point cover -PRON- fall to debate term 
at the end of half an hour -PRON- have reach an agreement 
i be to give captain golden one hundred and fifty dollar a month for the use of the boat pay the wage of master mate and crew pay for tow pilotage harbordue and other inciden tal provision the craft for six month and hand over one thousand dollar advancemoney inside of two week 
nothing further be to be do a a ter to four by captain golden until the preliminary payment be in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- look askance at the delay until i ex plain that the money be to come from the east 
-PRON- drain a glass to the success of -PRON- cruise and part good friend 
i be mightily pleased and try to find will iams and learn something about past history but william be abroad and i turn -PRON- step toward kearney street 
when i get back to the hotel i find vande leur wait for -PRON- in the office 
-PRON- come for ward handle -PRON- cane nervously and with something like anxiety in -PRON- shifty eye 
dis semble -PRON- real feeling i greet -PRON- amiably have a suggestion to make mr lorry say -PRON- seemingly relieve by -PRON- show of friendli what be -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- give -PRON- those three envelope and let -PRON- take all four over to mr office and have -PRON- put -PRON- in -PRON- safe 
-PRON- be artlessly say 
the fellow simplicity may have deceive -PRON- have -PRON- not be for the event of the night before 
a art to four those envelope be as safe in -PRON- pocket as -PRON- be in mr safe mr vandeleur i assure -PRON- shall always go armed -PRON- know i finish drop -PRON- voice while i have -PRON- about -PRON- 
i know how to shoot too if any one try foul play 
-PRON- face pale a little and the rattan quiver in -PRON- yellowgloved hand 
-PRON- next move be a puzzle 
reach into the breast of -PRON- coat -PRON- take out -PRON- envelope 
for a moment -PRON- hold -PRON- and look at -PRON- then present -PRON- to -PRON- 
if get the right of this thing mr lorry -PRON- say one envelope be of no earthly use with out the other three 
-PRON- may just as well keep the lot 
if the lady can trust -PRON- i ought to be able to 
all right mr vandeleur i acquiesce if -PRON- want -PRON- that way 
-PRON- will open -PRON- -PRON- hesitate per hap wonder whether i would take -PRON- upon -PRON- to get at the content of the envelope at once 
when -PRON- have be three day at sea say again -PRON- appear relieved 
a a to four have -PRON- do anything toward get a boat -PRON- inquire have charter the lady may a hundred schooner captain nathan golden 
-PRON- head be bent and -PRON- be rap -PRON- cane aimlessly against one of -PRON- shoe 
do -PRON- know anything about captain gold en -PRON- go on 
-PRON- come to -PRON- well recommend and cer tainly -PRON- schooner be all that -PRON- could desire 
relief again 
vandeleur have not the knack of hide -PRON- feeling 
how long do -PRON- think -PRON- will be before -PRON- get to sea 
some time within two week 
with that i excuse -PRON- and go up to -PRON- room 
vandeleur be a riddle and i want to get away by -PRON- while i give some thought to -PRON- particular case 
once inside -PRON- room i lock the door throw off coat and vest fill and light a pipe and lay the four mysterious envelope on a table 
vandeleur i know as well as i know that i be alive be back of that attempt to get the three envelope away from -PRON- 
fail in that -PRON- have a art to just come at -PRON- schoolboy fashion with the re quest that i give -PRON- the envelope to take to mr price for safekeeping 
and when -PRON- have fail in that -PRON- have give -PRON- -PRON- own document to keep with the other 
bend over the envelope i compare -PRON- 
-PRON- be all of a size identical in color and ap parently make out of the same kind of paper 
yet there be a differencehard to detect but -PRON- do not escape -PRON- 
the three envelope be long to mrs brackett miss anstruther and -PRON- all bear the same watermark vande leur envelope bear another 
now i may have be well within -PRON- right be honorably dispose and with the inter est of -PRON- companion at heartif i have open the envelope and learn -PRON- destination 
such a proceeding however would have a tendency to discredit -PRON- with mrs brackett and miss an struther besides i hate to trust -PRON- with the knowledge contain in the envelope before -PRON- get to sea 
i go the length however of open van deleur envelope 
-PRON- contain simply a piece of blank paper 
by hold the other envelope be a a to -PRON- tween -PRON- eye and the window i could see that -PRON- hold write enclosure 
vandeleur still have -PRON- original envelope and have try to fool -PRON- by give -PRON- a dummy 
why 
for nothing less i imagine than to parry any suspicion i may cherish against -PRON- on account of that futile night attack 
there be a lack of will show in -PRON- retreat chin and mental de ficiencie may be argue from -PRON- retreat forehead 
nevertheless -PRON- be play a cool game and -PRON- be play -PRON- craftily deliberately and well 
-PRON- cue be to let -PRON- think -PRON- have pull the wool entirely over -PRON- eye 
after the third day out -PRON- would find that i have be keep a rod in pickle for -PRON- 
-PRON- worry concentrate about this one point that vandeleur may in some way let the en velope give -PRON- by mr price get out of -PRON- possession 
if -PRON- hold onto that i be sure i could handle the rest of -PRON- 
seal order 
eight day of uneasiness follow 
mrs and miss serenity be ruffle by the mystery that hedge about -PRON- un dertaking and by a suspense of hope and fear that have mainly to do with -PRON- relative but -PRON- own doubt reach farther and i keep -PRON- in ignorance of the cause 
there be always vandeleur of course to fret -PRON- and as the day passedwithout a letter i be gan to have foreboding about uncle rufu and the fund 
uncle rufu have labor hard to keep -PRON- patrimony intact and conservatively invest yet what if in spite of -PRON- vigilance the money have be invest and lose 
every day i have several hour conversation with mrs brackett and miss anstruther 
to cheer and distract -PRON- thought i take -PRON- for little excursion about the cityto the park to chinatown to the theater to inspect the lady may 
a arter to four i will not deny that i take rare comfort in miss society that i come to look forward to these brief excursion and to enjoy -PRON- in spite of the many matter i have to harass -PRON- 
i have be draw toward miss anstruther from the first and the realization that -PRON- heart be trend inevitably in -PRON- direction come to -PRON- suddenly 
vandeleur likewise pay miss anstruther -PRON- attention 
-PRON- be this fact i think that bring -PRON- to an abrupt understanding of -PRON- own feel ing 
miss anstruther seldom discriminate between vandeleur and -PRON- 
sometimes i be -PRON- escort and vandeleur pilot mrs brackett and some time -PRON- be the other way around 
yet gradu ally and in spite of -PRON- attempt to keep -PRON- hide the breach widen between vandeleur and -PRON- self 
on the evening of the eighth day of -PRON- proba tion in kearney street i receive a letter from uncle rufu and have the satisfaction of find a draft for seven thousand dollar enclose 
the great part of -PRON- worry at once take wing al a a to ur though uncle rufus letter be something to make a man think 
the old gentleman implore -PRON- to leave -PRON- wander life interlard -PRON- supplication with passage from scripture -PRON- admonish -PRON- not to waste -PRON- substance in risk and adventure but to settle down engage in some christian business and make -PRON- a credit to the community which should finally claim -PRON- 
-PRON- deplore the fact that -PRON- cousin career have be such as to appeal to -PRON- roam nature and lead to emu lation and -PRON- offer a dire prophecy of priva tion and bad should i fail to heed -PRON- final word 
uncle rufu be in poor health and do not believe that -PRON- be long for this world 
-PRON- brother jeremiah have be kill in the boxer uprising in china and while the missionary have be a martyr to the christian faith and uncle rufu glory in -PRON- yet the blow have be a hard shall i admit -PRON- 
there be tear in -PRON- eye as i put aside the good man letter 
i have lay a course directly contrary to -PRON- ad vice and i be risk every dollar i have in the a a ter to world on a single throw 
more than that -PRON- cousin arthur be at the root of the venture 
that be an unpleasant night i pass but i arise with determination unshaken 
-PRON- first move be to acquaint -PRON- companion with the fact that -PRON- venture be ready for launch 
then i hurry to find captain golden and for two day -PRON- be more than busy 
store be purchase and hustle off to the lady may by the drayload 
the crew be get aboard and the blood sing in -PRON- vein as i watch sailor and stevedore trample the schooner white deck and stow -PRON- cargo 
on the second day after that draft have work -PRON- magic mrs brackett and miss anstruther come aboard with -PRON- luggage vandeleur follow later 
the tide turn at eight in the evening and -PRON- be to go out with -PRON- 
a little after six oclock logy bill hove alongside and beckon -PRON- to the pier 
ready for the start be ye -PRON- ask lead e -PRON- a little apart and drop -PRON- voice 
all ready i answer complacently 
what dye think of golden 
a arter to four -PRON- look to -PRON- like a man i can depend on 
-PRON- look that way to -PRON- lorry or never have send -PRON- to ye 
reckon -PRON- know that dude who s takin the trip with ye 
why say with a start and a quick look at -PRON- companion golden hasnot say anything about -PRON- and neither have vandeleur 
well i just get -PRON- pretty straight that -PRON- two have be thick as sardine in a box for the past couple o day 
-PRON- know -PRON- own busi ness lorry and if what i tell ye be any news -PRON- can turn -PRON- over in -PRON- block 
as i say at the startoff any skipper who d deal with -PRON- would have a yaller streak in -PRON- somer 
-PRON- donot know anything to dis credit 
not a thing and not a thing to -PRON- credit either if -PRON- come to that 
but the mate a whole sailor and a man 
stubb -PRON- name be and -PRON- can count on -PRON- to do what s white in all weather 
just remember that 
captain golden be lean over the rail star e at -PRON- 
william see -PRON- mention the cir cumstance sotto voce wring -PRON- hand wish -PRON- luck and go away 
a a to four later when the wharfhouse begin to fade in the dusk and the city light twinkle out on the hill i lean over the afterrail while the tug race -PRON- down the harbor 
there be with -PRON- all wrap up in a risky venture with two woman under convoy with un know business and an unknown port ahead with one know enemy in -PRON- party and with a final doubt inspire as to the schooner captain 
when be i to see san francisco again 
and be i to return victor or vanquish 
the mate be bawl order within a few yard of -PRON- and the hand be scramble about alow and aloft sweat out the canvas 
i give no attention to the orderly disorder of sea manship but continue to lean over the rail and watch the passing light 
a hand touch -PRON- arm 
mr lorry murmur a voice 
miss anstruther 
i exclaim 
-PRON- lean on the rail beside -PRON- 
of what be -PRON- think -PRON- ask softly 
i be silent 
perhaps i know -PRON- go on -PRON- voice aquiver with feeling 
-PRON- be think of -PRON- a a to four responsibility wonder whether -PRON- be do e right in take mrs brackett and -PRON- away -PRON- know not where and expose -PRON- to unforeseen danger 
-PRON- have risk a good deal of money too andpardon -PRON- for say do not think -PRON- be money -PRON- could afford to lose 
as for mrs brackett and -PRON- mr lorry -PRON- accompany -PRON- of -PRON- own free will 
-PRON- have nothing but gratitude for -PRON- generosity and kindness 
more than that -PRON- will not find that -PRON- be a drag upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be prepared to face bravely whatever come 
as for -PRON- may i ask -PRON- to be entirely frank with -PRON- con cerne -PRON- difficulty 
will -PRON- let -PRON- share the anxiety that be bind to come 
oh i know what -PRON- think 
-PRON- think i be a woman and ought to be spare the mental wor rie and the hardship but mr lorry i be capable of bear -PRON- full part and i insist that -PRON- let -PRON- do -PRON- 
will -PRON- 
while i doubt the policy of the step -PRON- sug geste yet there be no gainsaying -PRON- 
after -PRON- have be three day at sea miss anstruther say and the business of -PRON- ex a a to -PRON- pedition unfold -PRON- more tangibly i shall be happy to take -PRON- into -PRON- full confidence and to look to -PRON- for advice 
two head be wise than one -PRON- know i smile and really -PRON- be the only one of -PRON- party with whom i should care to counsel 
if -PRON- feel surprise because -PRON- word give vandeleur the cold shoulder -PRON- give no evi dence of -PRON- 
-PRON- small hand flutter whitely toward -PRON- in the dusk as i gently clasp -PRON- in -PRON- big palm -PRON- say softly thank -PRON- thank -PRON- ever so much 
now please do not worry about mrs brackett and -PRON- 
i have pass several sleepless night because -PRON- be -PRON- money that finance this queer under taking and because i fear -PRON- may lose -PRON- but i be quite easy in -PRON- mind now mr lorry 
somehow the conviction have creep over -PRON- that -PRON- expedition be to prove a grand success and that -PRON- have merely cast -PRON- bread upon the water 
-PRON- hand linger in mine until -PRON- have fin ishe speak then -PRON- withdraw -PRON- bade -PRON- a hasty good night and flutter like a wraith down the aftercompanion 
a protest voice 
midnight see -PRON- well up on the farallone the lady may dancing prettily through the open sea 
not until then do i go below and turn in 
vandeleur and i have one of the stateroom 
-PRON- have appropriate the low berth and be snore loudly 
although the quarter be cramp and the staggering of the ship throw -PRON- around some what while i be disrobe yet i manage to get into -PRON- blanket without wake -PRON- room mate 
the three envelope i take to bed with -PRON- merely to be on the safe side 
that first night must have be one of horror for mrs brackett 
the poor old lady have never be on a boat before and -PRON- discomfort be gan early be all right when -PRON- get use to -PRON- mum grinned captain golden addressing miss anstruther and refer to mrs brackett who be not able to leave -PRON- stateroom 
a a to four -PRON- be at breakfast in the cabin the four of anstruther vandeleur the skipper and -PRON- 
vandeleur sit at right and i at -PRON- left miss anstruther be at side of the board and the vacant chair beside -PRON- be reserve for mrs brackett 
opposite the captain end of the table be the mate place 
stubb would eat by -PRON- when the rest of -PRON- have finish 
by jove miss anstruther observe vande leur with an admiring sidewise glance -PRON- seem to be quite a sailor have cross the ocean twice return miss anstruther with a glance at -PRON- and -PRON- be a rough passage both time but i be not a bit uncomfortable 
the lady may ainot a liner by no mean pursue the skipper but -PRON- s as stanch as one even if -PRON- do tumble about more do mum as the man say bank on -PRON- even when -PRON- run into a gale an begin turn hand spring 
-PRON- seem to be perfectly at home on a boat mr lorry say miss anstruther 
ever since -PRON- have take -PRON- chair -PRON- have a a to four be try to draw -PRON- into the conversation but i prefer to keep silence and watch van deleur and the skipper for some sign of an under standing between -PRON- 
like -PRON- miss anstruther i laugh have be to sea before have about make up -PRON- mind mr lorry cut in the skipper that -PRON- could tell a top lift from a reefpoint 
about day after tomor row i suppose well know where be go hope so captain 
the crew of course be a bit curious the trouble on vyage like this when -PRON- donot know where -PRON- be go when -PRON- start out nor what -PRON- be go to do when -PRON- get there 
the fairly bil with wrong idee an all the hand be upsot an onsettle 
but curry -PRON- down as the man say if the need come 
as soon as the man find out what port be bind for i return probably become easy in -PRON- mind 
the port be bind for ainot the whole of -PRON- mr lorry 
golden drop -PRON- hand on the tableedge and fix the blue eye on -PRON- 
the swab overhaul -PRON- braintackle an a a to four wonder what s in the wind when -PRON- make land fall 
but i ainot stewin none 
the skipper grin expansively can take a pin or a blessed ropesend an make a blackjack or a blackbirder out o evry duckfoot aboard but see as how -PRON- get lady with -PRON- an donot want no knockdown and dragout mayhap -PRON- would be as well to let the crew have a workin knowledge o what s go on -PRON- business captain golden i snap resent -PRON- wishywashy attempt to get at the nub of -PRON- enterprise -PRON- and -PRON- man will know as much or as little as i see fit to tell 
that be straight talk for the skipper and in -PRON- own cabin too 
-PRON- stiffen and the red run into -PRON- face 
for a moment i think -PRON- would give -PRON- as good as i send but -PRON- change -PRON- mind 
-PRON- temper pass in an indulgent grin and -PRON- get up from the table give -PRON- -PRON- whack for this deal mr lorry -PRON- remark start for the companion way an -PRON- -PRON- right to blow the gaff or crawl farther back into -PRON- shell as -PRON- please but as master o this boat get to know -PRON- a a to destination either stick a pin in the proper pint on the chart when be three day out or i bout ship an put back to frisco an keep the advancemoney 
i want golden to understand -PRON- position and be glad of the opportunity to make -PRON- clear to -PRON- 
vandeleur follow the skipper to the deck and miss anstruther with an earnest look at -PRON- go back to mrs brackett 
stubb re lieve by the skipper come down 
-PRON- be a short thickset moonface man with a fringe of grayish muttonchop whisker 
i remain in the cabin long enough to pass the time of day with -PRON- and to take -PRON- sizing then climb to the poop 
-PRON- be good to sniff salt air again to watch the belly canvas to hear the wind sing in the rig ge the wave splash alongside the mellow note of the ship bell and to feel the heave of the deck underfoot 
difficulty loom vaguely ahead but i face -PRON- complacently 
as a passenger i be privileged to go and come as i see fit and take advantage of this to mingle somewhat with the man 
look in at the focsle spend an hour with the watch below a a to four and later i spend another hour with all hand during the first dogwatch 
-PRON- object be to measure up the man forward 
the covert investigation please -PRON- in some re spect and displease -PRON- in other 
include master and mate cook and cabin boy the ship complement number a half the cook be a fortune islander the cabin boy an native of oakland 
of the other six two be swede two american one a mexican and one a kanaka 
the mexican the kanaka and the american be a part of the flotsam and jetsam that go break ashore take the first berth that offer and think more of a good lay than of honest mean for get -PRON- 
the swede be sturdy taci turn good seaman and thriftyand thrift of course be an evidence of character 
for three day -PRON- have shift wind and clear sky and make a fair westing 
on the morning of the third day mrs brackett look a bit pale and distressed join -PRON- at table for the morning meal 
up to the time mrs brackett present -PRON- a a to four i have catch only fleeting glimpse of miss an struther 
nearly the whole of that third day however both lady be on deck and appear to enjoy the experience 
at eight bell of the second dogwatch cap tain golden come to -PRON- where i stand lean against the cabin near the break of the poop and touch -PRON- arm the time for -PRON- to open -PRON- seal order mr lorry say the skipper 
no more go -PRON- blind after tonight 
may -PRON- have the use of the cabin 
i ask

stubb have just turn out and stay on deck with -PRON- an give -PRON- the run of everything aft below 
but i want to know where be go when -PRON- be do with -PRON- chinning that s all 
i turn away and descend the companion stair close the door after -PRON- 
vandeleur sit under a ship lamp in the cabin read a book and smoke a cigarette 
-PRON- make as though -PRON- would leave when i come down 
wait mr vandeleur say -PRON- be three day out and -PRON- be time to hold -PRON- conference and open the envelope 
a a ter to -PRON- be nervous and ill at ease

-PRON- do not care to be present when i open that dummy envelope which -PRON- have give -PRON- 
-PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to remain i answer sternly 
sit down 
-PRON- show of authority dismay -PRON- and send -PRON- back into -PRON- chair 
-PRON- watch apprehen sively while i knock at the stateroom door to summon mrs brackett and miss anstruther 
the lady appear immediately miss an struther support mrs brackett and help -PRON- across the rock floor to a chair 
deary -PRON- sigh mrs brackett wasnot never mean to be a sailor i guess 
what be -PRON- mr lorry 
-PRON- be go to open the envelope mrs brackett say oh 
there be a flutter of excitement on the part of both lady 
take one of the pivotal chair i swing to the table and lay three envelope in front of -PRON- thank -PRON- for -PRON- envelope mr vande a arter to four leur say i sharply give the young man a steady glance 
what do -PRON- mean -PRON- demand weakly 
just what i say 
i want -PRON- envelope 
look here lorry -PRON- cry pull -PRON- together be this a joke 
not so far as i be concern 
why i give -PRON- -PRON- envelope before -PRON- leave san francisco 
that be where the joke come in vandeleur 
the envelope -PRON- give -PRON- contain nothing but a piece of blank paper 
then the joke be on all of -PRON- vandeleur remark with a feeble attempt at levity 
more than likely all the envelope contain piece of blank paper 
mrs brackett wring -PRON- hand and miss an struther look startled 
what i want from -PRON- vandeleur i go on be the envelope mr price give younot the one -PRON- hand -PRON- in san francisco 
-PRON- fall back in -PRON- chair make a pitiable attempt to dissemble 
by jove -PRON- stutter do -PRON- mean to in sinuate tha py a a to four come i cut in briskly keep -PRON- wait e 
vandeleur recover -PRON- a little get out of -PRON- chair and swagger toward -PRON- bind to force -PRON- hand be -PRON- -PRON- cry come to a halt brace -PRON- and glower at -PRON- with -PRON- buttermilk eye be i return calmly just that 
please mr vandeleur plead miss an struther in an agitated voice 
-PRON- must all work together -PRON- know or -PRON- can not hope for success be troublesome admonished mrs brackett in a tone of paternal tolerance now of all time 
vandeleur turn and bow to miss an struther 
-PRON- action miss anstruther go on van deleur melodramatically spring from a due re gard for -PRON- interest and mine 
-PRON- lady donot know anything about this fellow lorry but i have be at some pain to look -PRON- up 
from what i have learn about -PRON- i assure -PRON- that -PRON- be not a man to be trust 
-PRON- draw up to a arter to four -PRON- full height 
personally -PRON- finish with a flourish decline to trust -PRON- 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther stare first at vandeleur and then at -PRON- 
another man than vandeleur make such a speech would have hear from -PRON- promptly but there be a ludicrous side to this affair and -PRON- completely dwarf the youth insolence 
perhaps i speak up dryly -PRON- have better tell the lady what -PRON- know know -PRON- cry turn fiercely and level e at -PRON- a finger yellow with cigarette that -PRON- be an adventurer and that -PRON- will stoop to anything to feather -PRON- own nest 
be that all vandeleur enough i think 
i lift -PRON- clench right hand and bring -PRON- down in the open palm of -PRON- demand that -PRON- turn those three envelope over to -PRON- and make -PRON- the leader of this expedition 
silence follow silence break only by the slap of wave alongside the straining of timber a tramp of foot overhead shall be glad say i finally to yield to the a arter will of the majority 
if the lady want -PRON- for a leader vandeleur let -PRON- say so 
good gracious exclaimed mrs brackett with a long breath 
whoever hear of such a thing 
here mr lorry furnish the money to take -PRON- goodness know where and make -PRON- pos sible for -PRON- to find out whether there s anything or nothing back of this trip and mr vandeleur thank -PRON- by go into a tantrum like that 
young man -PRON- add severely give van deleur a withering look wouldnot have stir a step if -PRON- hadnot be for mr lorry and i wonot go a mile farther into this big ocean unless -PRON- have entire charge of the party feel the same way mr vandeleur say miss anstruther 
do be reasonable 
for an instant the wind seem take out of sail 
then -PRON- get -PRON- in hand again be go to look after -PRON- interest in spite of -PRON- say -PRON- puff out -PRON- chest like an angry robin 
before long both of -PRON- lady will thank -PRON- for -PRON- 
-PRON- start for the companion stair 
before -PRON- have take three step i have -PRON- by the collar a a to four and have lay -PRON- squirm back down on the table 
-PRON- claw kick shout threat and bawl for help 
in spite of -PRON- puny struggle i push a hand into the breast of -PRON- coat and draw out the envelope which i know to be there 
then i fling -PRON- aside 
-PRON- topple to the floor but spring up fume and rush for the deck be sorry lady i remark that i find -PRON- necessary to use force 
vandeleur however have queer idea and -PRON- can not allow -PRON- to man ace the success of -PRON- enterprise 
-PRON- do exactly right mr lorry approve miss anstruther 
now let -PRON- open the en velope before there be any more interference 
why who else be there to interfere flutter mrs bracktt 
no one i hope answer miss anstruther but mr vandeleur will appeal to captain gold en andand i must confess that i do not like captain look 
i be tear open the envelope while miss anstruther be speak 
a dissect clue 
the problem of the four envelope have so com pletely win -PRON- that i give little attention to the clash with vandeleur 
at least one of the veil that shroud -PRON- mission be about to lift 
a few moment after vandeleur have leave the lady forget -PRON- as utterly as i have do 
lean e forward over the table -PRON- watch breath lessly the swinging lamp overhead throw -PRON- shadow weirdly across the tabletop 
each envelope contain a piece of cardboard some three inch square 
on the back of each piece be the name of the person who have re ceive -PRON- with the word in parenthesis -PRON- be carefully 
on the reverse side of -PRON- piece and vande leur be figure with degree minute and sec ondmark and the letter and on the reverse side of mrs and miss an struther piece be word painstakingly print in a bold hand 
a a to four -PRON- look like a dissected puzzle say miss anstruther 
hardly a puzzle say for the piece go together without difficulty 
-PRON- be -PRON- instruc tion miss anstruther cut into quarter and each piece send to one of the four who be en title to a knowledge of the whole 
i juggle the piece about until -PRON- lie as fol low fortunel island 14940io io1230 mouth of sea calve on east side ten teakwlood case there -PRON- be 
i exclaim exultantly 
mrs brackett tremblingly adjust a pair of spectacle and bow -PRON- head close to the four rejoin quarter canot make out one thing -PRON- murmur 
what do -PRON- all mean anyway 
why mrs brackett return miss an struther with repress excitement -PRON- a a ter to four see that by fit those card together in that way -PRON- find out where -PRON- be to go donot suppose very bright zelda say mrs brackett shake -PRON- head helplessly but then i ainot so young as i use to be and there be a lot of thing past -PRON- understanding 
what be those figure with the funny mark after -PRON- 
those figure give -PRON- the latitude and longi tude of fortune island explain the girl pa tiently 
with those figure to guide -PRON- cap tain golden can lay -PRON- course for the island 
so -PRON- an island be go to 
yes 
not one of these cannibal island query mrs brackett in sudden alarm 
there be no cannibal island in this day and age of the world mrs brackett i hasten to reassure -PRON- 
thank goodness for that brackett 
when i be a girl i about godless people that eat one hate to land on an island where sighed mrs use to read another and -PRON- do such thing 
but if -PRON- boy tom be on that island and here -PRON- face harden resolutely find a a to ur -PRON- if the place be crowd with cannibal 
but what do the rest of that printing mean 
that i explain be something for -PRON- to investigate when -PRON- get there 
some one i go on donot know who have take a great deal of pain to set -PRON- on the right track 
all this -PRON- see be print on a large card the card be then cut into four piece and a quarter send to each of -PRON- 
that be where the quarter to four come in i suppose 
so cleverly be the instruction print on the large card that when quarter all four piece be necessary before the instruction could be read 
this of course be to keep any one of -PRON- from obtain an advantage over the other 
to learn this clue to -PRON- destination -PRON- be all oblige to bring -PRON- quarter and lie -PRON- together 
a very simple plan but entirely effect -PRON- have 
take -PRON- notebook from -PRON- pocket i write out the name of the island and the latitude and longitude twice each description on a separate leaf 
one of the leave i tear out to give to captain golden 
a a ter to -PRON- lady understand i think i proceed lay the detached leaf on the table and return e the notebook to -PRON- pocket that mr van deleur be not to be trust 
-PRON- be entitle to a quarterly share in -PRON- enterprise and -PRON- will deal with -PRON- justly no matter how -PRON- elect to deal with -PRON- but i think the information -PRON- have just develop should be keep from -PRON- 
vandeleur have mistake idea 
-PRON- must not for get that -PRON- know little of captain golden and even less of -PRON- crew 
if -PRON- tell vandeleur everything and -PRON- make a confidant of captain golden -PRON- donot say that -PRON- would but that -PRON- mightmake trouble for -PRON- 
-PRON- be well to be on the safe side 
dear dear falter mrs brackett becom e nervous do hope -PRON- wonot have any trouble with anybody 
mr vandeleur know enough already to whet captain curiosity put in miss an struther 
if the captain cupidity be arouse and as i say before i donot like the man lookswe may find the whole ship against -PRON- 
-PRON- couldnot be so bad as that miss anstruther i be sure say i hastily for certainly there be a a ter to four some honest hand aboard the schooner 
please donot be alarm by what i say 
i speak as i do merely to emphasize the need of caution with regard to vandeleur 
have -PRON- fix in -PRON- mind the print word on -PRON- card and mrs 
the girl lean over the card for a moment then look up with a nod 
take a match from -PRON- pocket i burn the card one by one pow dere the little heap of black ashe and drop -PRON- on the floor 
let -PRON- warn both of -PRON- say to say nothing not a word 
i will give that leaf on the table to captain golden and -PRON- will tell -PRON- all that -PRON- need to know 
if vandeleur try to talk with either of -PRON- please refer -PRON- to -PRON- afraid mourn mrs brackett that this work of our wonot be clear sailing after all a pretty old woman to be mix up in any trouble mr lorry 
-PRON- be only the thought of find -PRON- boy that bring -PRON- into this and while -PRON- mighty fine to think of secure a for tune toofor goodness know poverty poor at this very minutestill a woman of -PRON- year hasnot any business philanderin around the ocean a a ter to four look for a pot o gold hunting for tom that s all and now that -PRON- have make a good start -PRON- can count on -PRON- to keep -PRON- good foot for ward shall do all i can to avoid trouble mrs brackett say i earnestly both on -PRON- ac count and on miss i may add on -PRON- own as well 
if trouble come -PRON- will not be of -PRON- seek -PRON- may be sure nor because i do not do everything possible to keep away from -PRON- 
why do mr vandeleur deceive -PRON- in san francisco by give -PRON- an envelope contain e a piece of blank paper mr lorry query miss anstruther 
-PRON- do not tell -PRON- about that -PRON- add reproachfully do not want to bother -PRON- i return when -PRON- have so many other thing to think about 
i feel sure that vandeleur be try to trick -PRON- and -PRON- be not an hour after -PRON- give -PRON- the envelope before i investigate and discover that -PRON- contain nothing 
why do -PRON- want to trick -PRON- persist the girl 
-PRON- must have know that -PRON- would find -PRON- out sooner or later 
io9 a a to four i hesitate about tell of the night attack on -PRON- on the waterfront 
there be no way to avoid -PRON- however so i give -PRON- the story briefly 
mrs brackett be horrified and miss an struther eye flash 
only vandeleur could have inspire that at tack i go on imagine therefore that -PRON- give -PRON- the envelope to quiet any suspicion of -PRON- that i may have form 
-PRON- be treacherous breathe miss anstruther indignantly 
-PRON- be perfectly right not to trust -PRON- with any information 
of course -PRON- shall have -PRON- share of whatever -PRON- find but -PRON- be plain that -PRON- must do all the work -PRON- and perhaps -PRON- shall have to do -PRON- in the face of -PRON- open hostility 
-PRON- conference have proceed thus far when -PRON- be interrupt by the opening of the compan ion door 
captain golden and vandeleur come down the stair 
vandeleur be fume 
the skipper single eye hold a baleful gleam and i see that -PRON- car rie a revolver in -PRON- hand 
miss anstruther i request in a low tone i a a to will -PRON- and mrs brackett please retire to -PRON- stateroom will take mrs brackett to the stateroom the girl whisper rise from -PRON- chair pale but resolute and then i shall return and take -PRON- place at -PRON- side beg of -PRON- -PRON- mind be make up mr lorry -PRON- break in decisively 
while -PRON- support mrs brackett across the rock floor i get up brace -PRON- against the chairback and face the skipper and vandeleur 
who the trouble here demand captain golden planting -PRON- in front of -PRON- leg wide apart -PRON- ominous eye rake -PRON- up and down 
no trouble captain i answer easily 
mr vandeleur here say there be 
by jove stutter vandeleur the scoun drel lay hand on -PRON- throw -PRON- down on that table and take a document out of -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- use violence captain golden that s what -PRON- do get that document yet and i demand -PRON- back -PRON- indictment mr lorry as the man say come sternly from the skipper the only man that have a right to use violence on this foreanafter an i wonot have -PRON- passen ger robbin an sluggin each other 
do -PRON- rise to that 
i nod 
miss anstruther at that moment glide forward and take -PRON- station at -PRON- side 
i a a to four a lady present captain golden say and -PRON- revolver be out of place 
before i put up this gun go on the skip per doggedly want to know whether or not -PRON- be go to give dockyment back to -PRON- be not 
that document and three other have be destroy 
destroy cry vandeleur in a voice that throb and choke with wrath 
if -PRON- s de troye those paper captain golden then by gad 
i call on -PRON- to put -PRON- in iron 
i have as much right to those paper as any one and if -PRON- destroy -PRON- -PRON- do -PRON- because -PRON- want to rob -PRON- that will do vandeleur say i sharply step pe toward -PRON- 
-PRON- jump back and behind golden as though fear i be about to lay hand on -PRON- again 
avast there warn the skipper put out -PRON- arm 
what business -PRON- get destroyin property belong to vandeleur 
whatever business -PRON- be captain golden at least -PRON- be no business of yours 
-PRON- gorge be rise 
something touch -PRON- a a to sleeve as though to arouse in -PRON- a realize sense of what i be do 
i drop -PRON- eye and see miss small white hand 
i give -PRON- a reassuring glance out of the clew of -PRON- eye then pick from the table the leaf with the longitude and latitude of -PRON- destina tion 
this be a fitting time for -PRON- to come to an understanding captain i announce 
-PRON- duck -PRON- head fix -PRON- to say something ironical but i cut in ahead hold here a slip of paper give the bearing of -PRON- destination but before i turn -PRON- over to -PRON- i must know whether -PRON- intend to live up to -PRON- contract swith -PRON- 
-PRON- vouchsafe no response 
who own the lady may i pursue 
-PRON- know as well as i do -PRON- snarl 
and who s -PRON- skipper 
what sort of a fool question be that 
who charter the schoon 
-PRON- do 
who sign the contract and put up the ad vancemoney 
yoti do 
i a a ter to so -PRON- follow that the lady may -PRON- skipper and crew be under -PRON- order for a period not exceed six month 
providin -PRON- business be honest -PRON- quali fie insinuatingly not so bloomin sure of that yet 
-PRON- be honest and i own -PRON- and -PRON- boat for the period of -PRON- contract 
there be three per son aboard who be -PRON- brackett miss anstruther and a vandeleur 
if i choose to have -PRON- put in at honolulu and leave vandeleur -PRON- will do -PRON- 
that catch the skipper 
-PRON- also make a salu tary impression upon vandeleur change quick glance 
-PRON- ainot treatin the two ex vandeleur much like a guest mumble captain golden ease off a bit on -PRON- temper 
that be an affair between vandeleur and -PRON- 
-PRON- have nothing whatever to do with -PRON- 
now then once for all be -PRON- go to continue this voyage or be -PRON- go to put back to san francisco 
if -PRON- will tell -PRON- where be go -PRON- an swered sulkily continue the voyage 
a a ter to very good say hand -PRON- the paper the latitude and longitude of -PRON- first landfall here i turn grimly on young man doesnot make -PRON- necessary for -PRON- to put -PRON- ashore at honolulu 
-PRON- havenot any right to go through with this business without -PRON- babble vandeleur -PRON- face turn a sickly gray 
-PRON- be thoroughly cow and not a little frightened have a moral right to do anything i see fit that will make for the good of this expedition i declare 
if -PRON- be foolish enough to try to meddle with -PRON- and so increase -PRON- difficulty -PRON- shall certainly drop -PRON- off somewhere until the work be do 
i have a share -PRON- ask -PRON- appeal e gaze travel from -PRON- to miss anstruther 
certainly mr vandeleur speak up miss an struther 
mr lorry intend to protect -PRON- in terest 
if -PRON- will be advise by -PRON- -PRON- will do exactly as -PRON- say get -PRON- in a corner be sullen response so i suppose have to jump whenever -PRON- crack the whip 
what do -PRON- a a to -PRON- want -PRON- to do -PRON- jerk out turn in -PRON- di rection 
sheer away and keep to -PRON- until this boat put into san francisco again say i promptly 
and keep a still tongue in -PRON- head i add with a significant glance at the skipper who have -PRON- back to -PRON- overhaul some chart do that by jove growl vandeleur with a black look 
and if -PRON- play -PRON- false lorry donot forget that have an accounting 
if i find i continue ignore -PRON- last re mark that -PRON- be not act strictly in accord ance with -PRON- instruction after -PRON- lay -PRON- south erly course i shall have -PRON- transfer to the first ship -PRON- fall in with 
-PRON- bend -PRON- brow at -PRON- but make no answer 
captain golden -PRON- call 
well interrogate the skipper look up from a chart which -PRON- have lay over the table decline to occupy the same stateroom with this man any longer 
have i -PRON- permission to bunk in the focsle 
-PRON- can bunk in the crosstree for all -PRON- snap the skipper but -PRON- better ask mr 
a a to four lorry 
-PRON- seem to be cock o the walk on this hooker at the present speakin 
bunk wherever -PRON- please say vandeleur carry a deeply injure air across the cabin and into -PRON- stateroom and -PRON- carry -PRON- out again together with a couple of suitcase and a hatbox 
-PRON- never deign a look in miss direction or mine until -PRON- reach the foot of the companion stair 
then -PRON- whirl about match -PRON- wit against -PRON- any day lorry -PRON- scowl 
as for miss anstruther and mrs brackett just let -PRON- remember that a man who will steal for -PRON- will steal from -PRON- 
with that vandeleur lurch up the stair and out onto the deck 
miss anstruther give -PRON- a faint smile 
evidently -PRON- appreciation of van deleur performance be equal to -PRON- own 
no such place call captain golden a fin ger of -PRON- mutilated hand rest on the chart before -PRON- off sounding with this lati tude an longitude o yours mr lorry 
what do -PRON- mean 
i query step to -PRON- side no such island down on the chart 
i if a a to four -PRON- the fortune island -PRON- be after -PRON- be way off not after the fortune island 
that other fortune island ainot chart 
a glance at the chart show -PRON- that -PRON- be right 
-PRON- be an admiralty chart and a good cine 
the island be there all right say i confi dently even if -PRON- isnot down on the chart 
golden shake -PRON- head 
some one hand -PRON- a gold brick -PRON- aver 
-PRON- four en velope where do -PRON- hear anything about four en velope 
i interrupt sharply 
the skipper look blank for an instant 
why say -PRON- get the whiphand of -PRON- self -PRON- talk about -PRON- envelope when vandeleur an i come down 
not that i know of i return shortly 
then vandeleur tell -PRON- afore -PRON- come down 
anyhow -PRON- an -PRON- friend have be gold bricke as i say not -PRON- affair captain golden i observe deliberately 
take -PRON- to the spot in dicate 
if -PRON- find open water then well bout a a ter to ship and return to san francisco in sure against loss no matter what happen say -PRON- then put away the chart and go on deck to give the man at the wheel oll1 se 
-PRON- do very well indeed mr lorry say miss anstruther can not begin to tell -PRON- how glad i be that -PRON- do not come to any vio lence with captain golden 
that lesson in who s who be come to the captain i answer profit by -PRON- i think 
still -PRON- murmur do not trust -PRON- 
-PRON- almost seem as though there be some understand e between the captain and mr vandeleur 
certainly mr vandeleur have tell captain golden more than be necessary 
no doubt and when vandeleur get into the focsle -PRON- may proceed to enlighten the crew 
but i donot see how -PRON- can help that too bad commiserated miss anstruther that -PRON- should have such a contraryminde per son in -PRON- party 
however as -PRON- say -PRON- can not be help so -PRON- must make the good of -PRON- 
-PRON- be a good stroke to burn the four card and a a to four not trust mr vandeleur with the rest of the in formation 
-PRON- wonot be long i suppose until every one on the ship know that -PRON- be make for an uncharted island 
that will be common gossip before many day 
what will the crew think of -PRON- and -PRON- mis sion 
the first thing a sailor always think of on a voyage like -PRON- be treasure 
-PRON- will -PRON- be agine probably that be go after pearl 
a mysterious voyage be quite apt to whet a mari ner curiosity 
and the idea of pearl be quite apt to whet -PRON- greed be -PRON- not 
in that miss anstruther have strike the key note 
i marvel at -PRON- foresight 
be -PRON- an optimist miss anstruther 
i smile try to be -PRON- answer catch -PRON- spirit and also smile 
then as optimist -PRON- will not cross any bridge until -PRON- come to -PRON- 
yet -PRON- be well donot -PRON- think to imagine i a a ter to what lie before -PRON- and try to be prepare for whatever may happen 
exactly so i agree -PRON- eye wander to the rack that hold the rifle 
-PRON- notice -PRON- glance at the firearm and drop -PRON- head with a little shiver 
-PRON- will not forget what -PRON- promise -PRON- while -PRON- be be tow down the bay -PRON- ask will not forget 
-PRON- will find miss an struther that i shall rely upon -PRON- judgment a great deal 
-PRON- may rely upon -PRON- in other way too 
perhaps mr lorry and -PRON- eye dance as -PRON- rise to -PRON- have more courage than -PRON- be pleased to credit -PRON- with 
at any rate i shall stand at -PRON- side no matter what come 
good night 
good night say and -PRON- separate to go to -PRON- a bonny girl truly run the current of -PRON- thought a girl to fight with and a girl to fight for 
who could not succeed in any undertaking with zelda anstruther at -PRON- side 
the i have always plenty of food for thoughtthe obscure detail of -PRON- enterprise offer -PRON- that and the progress of event be continually warp -PRON- mental process to a different angle 
for instance -PRON- speculation deal often with the mysterious unknown who have write out -PRON- direction quarter -PRON- and distribute -PRON- so oddly 
who be this person 
and why be -PRON- hide -PRON- hand and forego a part in the expedition 
nay more if there be a fortune to be have why do -PRON- not go after -PRON- -PRON- in stead of turn -PRON- over to other 
then too what sort of a fortune be -PRON- 
of what do -PRON- consist 
inasmuch as i have stake -PRON- all on the ven ture -PRON- may be that i give the outcome more thought than do any of the other 
-PRON- be deeply interested of course but hardly to the ex tent that i be 
a fresh viewpoint be mine when i learn a arter to four that the ostensible fortune lie somewhere over sea 
the angle change with the treacherous maneuver of vandeleur with the information that -PRON- landfall lie well down in the tropic that -PRON- be not chart and consequently shroud in doubt 
all these and many other develop ment keep the vague perspective constantly shift 
-PRON- one firm support be miss anstruther 
come fair weather or foul success or failure i feel that -PRON- would not fail -PRON- 
mrs brackett also in -PRON- way be thoroughly dependable 
circumstance narrow -PRON- life to the little world of emmetsburg have not give -PRON- the broad outlook most available for -PRON- pre ent need 
of the experience that count in the large affair of existence miss anstruther have acquire infinitely more in less than half mrs year 
-PRON- seem almost a sacrilege to do or say any thing that would disturb mrs serenity or hopefulness 
-PRON- artlessness and simplicity no less than -PRON- advanced year counsel -PRON- to smooth the path before -PRON- 
miss anstruther on the other hand would not a a to four have content -PRON- one moment unless -PRON- know -PRON- to be in touch with every detail of -PRON- enterprise 
during that first night of -PRON- lone occupancy of the stateroom -PRON- run into some heavy weather 
the lady may wrestle and tumble with the long pacific swell and i hear much tramp about on the deck and much shouting of order 
mrs brackett be again indispose and do not join -PRON- at breakfast 
neither do vandeleur but from indisposition of another sort 
-PRON- be sulky and the skipper tell miss anstruther and -PRON- that -PRON- choose to eat at the second table with mr stubb 
follow breakfast i take a turn on deck 
the sun have appear for only a brief space and then have withdraw behind ominouslooke cloud 
the sea be a dull leaden gray and whitecaps rear above the schooner rail and now and then tumble aboard 
a peep into the binnacle show -PRON- the compasscard bear southwest 
the glass be down sir and be in for a sou easter say the man at the wheel 
this man be one of the swede anderson by a a to name 
-PRON- easy command of english surprised i should have like to talk with -PRON- but the skipper be pace the lee alley and may have resent a conversation with the helmsman 
with a nod to anderson i go over and sit down on the cabin 
the wind be steadily increase 
captain golden tramp up and down and sidestep with the roll of the ship appear to be com mune with -PRON- 
all -PRON- canvas be set and draw 
every once in a while -PRON- lee rail go under and a wave sweep -PRON- amidship with the windward roll and run hiss through the scupper 
-PRON- be high time i think that the skipper begin take in sail 
however if -PRON- be bad form to talk with the man at the wheel -PRON- be even bad form to advise a skipper what to do in handle -PRON- ship 
all hand have be turn out 
i presume stubb have do that before -PRON- go below 
hud dle forward i could see the man alternately stare to windward and up at the poop where a a ter to four the preoccupied skipper be mechanically pace -PRON- round 
be -PRON- anything of a seaman mr lorry shout captain golden bracing -PRON- near i donot know whatever put the question into -PRON- head nor what possible bear -PRON- could have on -PRON- thought 
-PRON- be certainly odd that -PRON- should address -PRON- in such a way at such a time enough of a seaman to know that -PRON- will have -PRON- on -PRON- beamend if -PRON- donot begin to snug down i call back to -PRON- sharply 
-PRON- blue eye glint 
what reply be on -PRON- lip i never know for at that moment a fierce gust hit -PRON- and over -PRON- go with -PRON- lee rail under 
a look forward show -PRON- vandeleur hang e for life to a pinrail and with -PRON- heel buoy up in the deluge that sweep -PRON- 
the pull on -PRON- arm be too much for -PRON- 
hurl from -PRON- support -PRON- be slam against the weather bulwark and a moment later haul out of the scupper by the mexican 
then personally con ducte to the hatch -PRON- be drop be low 
a a to four a scud of rain drive down on -PRON- and as i start for the companionway stubb bound out of -PRON- to the deck 
captain golden be arouse at last and as i go below i hear -PRON- bawl to jibs 
i would know what -PRON- come up the hand to get in the topsail and have give something handsome to the skipper have have in -PRON- mind when to -PRON- and ask if i be anything of a seaman 
miss anstruther be in the cabin when i get below 
this be -PRON- first storm isnot -PRON- mr lorry -PRON- ask bit of a blow miss anstruther i reply cheeringly help -PRON- on into the trade and the quicker -PRON- strike the trade the quicker -PRON- get to fortune island 
-PRON- refer to the tradewind 
yes 
the captain have put the ship on -PRON- new course 
-PRON- be now head southwest i assure -PRON- 
-PRON- didnot think -PRON- would refuse to take -PRON- to fortune island after -PRON- promise to -PRON- last evening do -PRON- 
a a ter to four hardly know what i think -PRON- answer musingly the more i see of captain golden the more -PRON- distrust of -PRON- increase shall watch -PRON- closely -PRON- may be sure of that say a wail come from the stateroom 
poor mrs brackett be almost worry out of -PRON- sense say miss anstruther start for the stateroom -PRON- think -PRON- may go to the bot tom any moment and insist that i should find -PRON- and ask if there be any danger 
tell -PRON- -PRON- may be a little uncomfortable for a while i smile but that -PRON- be perfectly safe 
-PRON- eat -PRON- dinner with the roughweather tray in place and i do not think miss an struther find -PRON- a very enjoyable meal 
-PRON- eat but little and soon leave the table with some bread and tea for mrs brackett 
during the brief period -PRON- sit with the skip per and -PRON- -PRON- grow dislike of captain gold en be plainly manifest 
-PRON- avoid -PRON- glance even when -PRON- ask -PRON- a question -PRON- keep -PRON- eye away from -PRON- when -PRON- answer 
a a to four that be the woman of -PRON- i suppose 
as i do not want the skipper to feel that -PRON- distrust -PRON- i resolve to speak to miss anstruther and give -PRON- a little good counsel at the first oppor tunity 
vandeleur do not come to the cabin for -PRON- dinner 
mr stubb tell -PRON- with a humorous grin that -PRON- hadnot the nerve to make the pas sage from the aft with the big sea run ning 
the rest of that day be dreary enough 
miss anstruth clung to -PRON- stateroom in constant attendance upon mrs brackett and i miss -PRON- sadly 
i have another brief glimpse of -PRON- at supper when -PRON- resume -PRON- same air of frigid reserve toward captain golden 
the skipper be not a dense man and i know that miss attitude do not escape -PRON- 
be -PRON- sufficiently dense to misconstrue -PRON- 
that be the point that bother -PRON- 
as i lie in -PRON- bunk that night with the lady may wallow and plunge toward the heart of the great pacific i fall back on the usual pas time of -PRON- solitary wake hour 
-PRON- mental carpentry have to do with dovetail together cer i a a to four tain speculation in such a way as to make a tangible fabric of three dimension 
of course i give -PRON- up 
the material with which i have to work be too vague for a lucid product 
some agility be necessary to keep -PRON- in -PRON- berth 
nevertheless i sleptby spell 
the groan timber the stamp of foot overhead the shriek of the wind and the splash of the rain and the wave all united in a lullaby 
several hour must have pass when a rough hand drum on -PRON- door 
i start up with a suddenness that bring -PRON- head in sharp con tact with the bottom of the upper berth 
flounder to the door i pull -PRON- open and find petie the cabinboy hang to a chair in the cabin 
what do -PRON- want 
i demand 
mr vandeleur send -PRON- sir answer petie 
-PRON- want to see -PRON- in the focsle 
if -PRON- want to see -PRON- i answer why doesnot -PRON- come here 
-PRON- ainot able sir 
-PRON- get stove in a little by a wave that board -PRON- this mornin 
what time be -PRON- petie 
a a to four four bell of the midwatch sir 
i have not hear that vandeleur have be hurt by -PRON- morning experience 
yet i give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt get into -PRON- clothe hur riedly take the skipper oilskin coat and sou wester from the cabin table where -PRON- have throw -PRON- and climb out into the howl gale 
the rain have abate somewhat but the fierce wind drive the schooner at a racehorse clip through the inky sea 
just from the light cabin as i be i could hardly see -PRON- hand before -PRON- face 
where ye go mr lorry call the mate from somewhere behind -PRON- 
vandeleur want to see -PRON- in the focsle 
purty time this to turn out a man 
mind yer eye as ye go forard sir a nasty sea run 
i lurch down the lee step from the poop sense the windward roll by the feel of the deck and hustle forward along the lee rail 
the roll from windward catch -PRON- close to the main rig ging 
by then i could see a little and i jump into the shroud just as a huge wave foam athwart i a a to ship with the slant of the deck 
watch -PRON- chance i drop to the dripping plank and start on again 
forward of the galley with the hatch but a few yard away a stunning blow catch -PRON- from behind 
i try to cry out but every muscle go lax under the impact of the heavy hand that -PRON- 
a sickening feeling of abject helplessness rush through every nerve 
for an instant the raging of wind and sea die away in blank si lence 
then with a desperate drag upon -PRON- re serve power i regain -PRON- sense and feel that i be be propel toward the side of the ship 
who -PRON- be that have lay hold of -PRON- i could not see but i realize that -PRON- life be at stake and that if i save -PRON- i must fight 
lift -PRON- voice in a wild yell i strike out furiously with -PRON- clenched fist grapple with -PRON- unknown antagonist and -PRON- go to the deck and roll over and over into the scupper 
there -PRON- head bring up with tremendous force against the bulwark and once more everything tangible slip from -PRON- 
i cool villainy 
when i regain -PRON- wit the mate have -PRON- up on the poop in the lee alley 
there be keen pain at the back of -PRON- head and in -PRON- ear a dull roaring not of the wind or the sea 
what do ye yell for mr lorry inquire stubb help -PRON- to -PRON- foot and support -PRON- as i lean against the cabin man donot usually yell like that when a bit of a comber come aboard and slam -PRON- head first into the bulwark should say not 
i agree -PRON- see any one else when -PRON- pick -PRON- up mr stubb 
only the watch 
i grapple with any one 
because of the dark i feel rather than see the mate amazement 
a moment more and -PRON- word leave no doubt of -PRON- 
now keelhaul -PRON- -PRON- exclaim think i a a to four ye be too much of a sailor to git knock off -PRON- pin 
be ye set on be and from behind just forward of the galley 
i leave -PRON- mark on the man who do -PRON- that swear to 
come forward with -PRON- mr stubb until i can have a look at the watch well crawl into -PRON- bunk for now mr lorry counsel the mate halfafter two in the mornin an -PRON- investigation can wait go to settle this now i declare want to have a look at vandeleur as well as at the watch 
-PRON- head in spite of -PRON- throbbing ache be as clear as a bell and i be as steady on -PRON- foot as ever 
-PRON- gain the hatch without much difficulty and i descend leave stubb to send the watch down a man at a time 
a chorus of snore reverberate in the focsle battle with the outer noise and with a thump of boot against the bulkhead as the vessel roll and the slap and swish of oilskin 
one of the swede be the first to come down 
-PRON- face bear no evidence of rough treatment 
-PRON- have hear -PRON- yell -PRON- state but -PRON- have see a a ter to four no one forward aside from -PRON- watchmate 
-PRON- have be doze on the deckhouse under the lee of one of the boat 
the mexican follow the swede tell a similar story and bear no mark of a struggle 
next come one of the american a lowbrowe bull necked ruffian who i be sure would be capable of anything in a pinch 
but -PRON- pass muster as easily as the other two 
so much for the watch 
take the sealamp from -PRON- swinging frame i go from bunk to bunk examine the face of the sleeper 
these offer no evidence whatever 
vandeleur be sleep apparently as soundly as the rest 
-PRON- do not seem in very bad case from -PRON- experi ence with the boarding wave 
with one hand i shake -PRON- into wakefulness 
well say i grimly as -PRON- lie stare up at -PRON- what do -PRON- want 
jove -PRON- stutter 
what be -PRON- do here 
what do -PRON- want 
-PRON- send for -PRON- -PRON- mumble and i see fear in -PRON- weak face 
a a ter to four well 
i say between -PRON- tooth lean down over -PRON- 
out with -PRON- 
mrs brackett have a bottle of arnica in -PRON- carpetbag with a futile readiness that bring a halfsmile to -PRON- lip and i want -PRON- to get -PRON- for -PRON- 
why didnot -PRON- tell petie that when -PRON- send -PRON- aft think i do but i be in a good deal of pain and may have neglect to do so arnica in the medicinech 
why didnot -PRON- have petie go to captain golden didnot think of that -PRON- gulp 
there be several thing vandeleur that -PRON- didnot think about something however that -PRON- have best keep in mind from this on hereafter i shall carry a loaded revolver and if any one try to slip -PRON- overboard there will be shoot 
look sharp -PRON- lad 
if -PRON- want to stay aboard the schooner -PRON- will have to do dif ferently 
then i put the lamp back in the bracket climb to the deck and go to the galley 
sli ding the door i step into the narrow room 
the cook sleep in a cubbyhole off -PRON- kitchen and a a ter to a scratch match give -PRON- a good view of -PRON- ebony face 
no -PRON- wasnot the cook 
when i regain the poop the mate inquire anxiously for the result of -PRON- investigation 
i tell -PRON- of -PRON- failure to find the man i be look e for 
-PRON- be strangely quiet for a minute -PRON- fin ger run up under -PRON- souwester and scra ping through -PRON- scant hair 
if i be -PRON- mr lorry -PRON- remark wouldnot give that vandeleur any more rope than necessary be stringin the crew with a lot o talk about treasure an the lord know what 
mebby -PRON- know how sailor be an meb by -PRON- donot but -PRON- ainot policy an be like to breed trouble betwixt -PRON- an the main mast -PRON- add hastily 
thank -PRON- mr stubb say i grimly 
from this on have two eye for vandeleur 
thereupon i lurch down the companionway and crawl back into bed 
by the follow morning the storm have blow -PRON- out the wind have die down to a skipper breeze and the heavy sea be slowly subside 
there be a lump at the back of -PRON- head and a a to four a bruise at the crown 
the skin have be fray from the knuckle of -PRON- right hand too and i be more certain than ever that i have leave some mark on the man who have attack -PRON- 
every doubt vanish at breakfast 
when captain golden appear and take -PRON- seat there be a patch of courtplaster as large as a half dollar paste over -PRON- left temple 
-PRON- angle of vision have again change 
so deeply impressed be i by -PRON- discovery that i be more than taciturn to the other at table even to mrs brackett who have put in an appear ance with clearing weather 
snap by a ropesend explain the skip per rest the finger of -PRON- mutilated hand on the patch of courtplaster 
that be an un common wind -PRON- have -PRON- add and everythin loose be snap for a while 
there be a brief respite of silence 
mr stubb tell -PRON- -PRON- have a rough experi ence last night mr lorry continue the skip per -PRON- voice easy and noncommittal 
nothing to speak of i answer with a quieting glance into miss apprehen sive face 
a a to ur excuse -PRON- i go on deck 
so captain golden be the man who have lay for -PRON- forward of the galley 
-PRON- seem incredible that the skipper should descend to such cool villainy 
and the cunning of -PRON- 
for -PRON- have leave -PRON- oilskin on the cabin table for tacit evidence that -PRON- be in -PRON- state why should -PRON- want to get rid of -PRON- 
be i not the one from whom -PRON- be to receive -PRON- hire 
there could be but one answer to the question that burn in -PRON- brain 
golden and vandeleur have exchange confidence and if appearance speak rightly have go into a conspiracy 
with -PRON- out of the way the two rogue could have intimidate the two woman and force a confessionfrom mrs brackett at leastof the detail of -PRON- mission which -PRON- be hold back 
suppose i have be throw over the rail in the soueaster 
not a soul aboard save the two most nearly concerned in the plot would have know that -PRON- be not the result of accident 
receive a doubt of golden from logy bill a a to four at the last moment i be a fool for not break -PRON- contract lose the advancemoney and hir e another ship 
the forenoon watch be the captain 
dur e the afternoon watch which be the mate anstruther come on deck and join -PRON- at a place where -PRON- could talk out of hearing of the man at the wheel 
what be that rough experience -PRON- have last night mr lorry 
miss anstruther ask 
vandeleur send for -PRON- at two oclock in the morning yy and -PRON- go 
the cabinboy say -PRON- have be hurt and want to see -PRON- i continue with a trace of a smile wasnot expect foul play -PRON- know but some one make an attack upon -PRON- from be hind and try to throw -PRON- overboard 
i see the quick pallor rise in -PRON- face and -PRON- small hand grip the rail 
miss anstruther i mur mure believe -PRON- i should not have tell -PRON- this have captain golden not arouse -PRON- curi osity 
-PRON- say mr lorry -PRON- return level i a a to four -PRON- steady eye at -PRON- that -PRON- would tell -PRON- everything 
but such rough wor be one of the contingency of this expedi tion -PRON- finish 
do -PRON- find out who at tack -PRON- -PRON- go on push straight for the nub of the difficulty leave -PRON- mark on the fellow i answer show -PRON- skinned knuckle 
-PRON- roll against the side of the ship and before i have a chance to find out who -PRON- be the blow from the bulwark cause -PRON- to lose consciousness 
but -PRON- could find the villainby -PRON- mark 
-PRON- touch -PRON- hand against mine as -PRON- lie on the rail 
do -PRON- look for -PRON- mr lorry do say scan the watch with the mate help and i go into the and look into the sleeping face of the watch below 
i also go to the galley and take the doctor measure 
the man wasnot in the forecastle or the gal ley 
-PRON- voice be intense and earnest 
no 
do -PRON- observe mr vandeleur particularly 
a a ter to ur why -PRON- wouldnot have the strength or the courage for such an attempt miss anstruther 
nevertheless i do observe -PRON- 
do -PRON- send for -PRON- 
and if so what be -PRON- excuse 
i tell -PRON- 
then as -PRON- mind travel swiftly along the various circumstantial link in the chain -PRON- pallor return and a look of horror fill -PRON- face 
captain golden -PRON- gasp and look around fearfully as though halfexpecte to see the treacherous skipper 
-PRON- reasoning miss anstruther say bring -PRON- to the same point which i reach this morning 
-PRON- will worry more than ever now and that be why i do not want -PRON- to know 
-PRON- be right that i should know -PRON- aver -PRON- lithe form straighten 
-PRON- be the main stay of -PRON- venture mr lorry 
vandeleur un derstand that and so do captain golden 
this be -PRON- -PRON- and then take whatever part in -PRON- plan -PRON- choose 
the mys tery the fact that -PRON- be go after a possible fortune have arouse cupidity and a a to four -PRON- have invoke the aid of the skipper 
ah -PRON- be plain plain 
and itit be fiendish 
-PRON- eye range forward to where vandeleur be sit on the main hatch blaze angrily 
hereafter -PRON- continue a resolute note in -PRON- voice -PRON- must go armed every minute 
i tap the sag pocket of -PRON- coat 
that suggest -PRON- to -PRON- miss an struther 
furthermore -PRON- pursue -PRON- must be wary and watchful 
everything mr lorry everything depend upon -PRON- 
i remain silent 
event seem to prove con clusively that i stand between mrs brackett and miss anstruther and trickery on the part of vandeleur and captain golden 
do -PRON- think say miss anstruther as though by afterthought that captain golden notice -PRON- dislike 
would -PRON- infer from that that -PRON- and i suspect -PRON- of underhand deal ing with -PRON- 
and if -PRON- do draw such an in ference could -PRON- have have anything to do with -PRON- experience last night 
-PRON- be a wondrously clearheade girl 
the a a to four more i talk with -PRON- the more -PRON- admiration be arouse by -PRON- perspicacity be go to speak with -PRON- about that miss anstruther i reply 
really i think captain golden notice how -PRON- avoid -PRON- 
cer tainly -PRON- could draw no inference from that to lead to the act of last night still if -PRON- could be a little more amiable -PRON- may be well 
be i to act a lie mr lorry 
the color creep into -PRON- face as -PRON- speak would not call -PRON- that say i hastily 
there be such a thing -PRON- know as be diplo matic 
in a way mrs brackett and -PRON- and i be in captain power 
this be -PRON- ship and the sailor recognize -PRON- authority 
when afloat a master authority be a fearsome thing for -PRON- be often a law unto -PRON- 
if captain golden think -PRON- distrust -PRON- -PRON- will do one of two thing 
either -PRON- will try to demean -PRON- self in such a way as to set -PRON- fear at rest or -PRON- will go -PRON- way and let -PRON- know that -PRON- do not care how -PRON- regard -PRON- 
whichever thing -PRON- do i add slowly the knowledge that -PRON- suspect -PRON- will render -PRON- more cautious 
-PRON- will be more careful to a a to hide -PRON- hand and hence will be all the more dan gerous 
for several minute miss anstruther be in a brown study 
at last a smile not untinged with selfreproach wreathe about -PRON- sensitive lip have be very foolish -PRON- observe but i be a girl of pronounced opinion 
when i dis like any one -PRON- be hard for -PRON- to dissemble 
be -PRON- equally generous with those whom -PRON- like 
what be that inscrutable light that flash in -PRON- eye 
what would i not have give could i have interpret -PRON- 
the word have no sooner leave -PRON- lip than i be angry at -PRON- presumption must go now -PRON- say ignore -PRON- que tion save for that one swift look see very clearly mr lorry that -PRON- wellbeing depend in a measure upon -PRON- 
please observe in the morning how good an actress i can beupon occasion 
-PRON- would act a lie as -PRON- call -PRON- for the sole purpose of disarm the skipper in -PRON- be half 
-PRON- emotion be conflict as i watch -PRON- flit from sight through the companion 
the uncharted isle 
for a voyage begin under such exciting cir cumstance the day follow -PRON- rough ex perience in the soueaster pass in an unex pecte dearth of incident 
i be at a loss to ac count for this except on the supposition that van deleur and captain golden be hold -PRON- ulterior design in abeyance 
miss anstruther be indeed an actress of no mean ability 
whether at meal in the cabin or with captain golden on deck -PRON- so favor -PRON- with -PRON- wit and -PRON- conversational charm that the crafty seadog appear fairly capti vate 
the skipper begin a stealthy and in some re spect ludicrous personal overhauling 
for in stance -PRON- notice one morning that the dingy green cotton shield which have cover -PRON- useless eye have be replace with a diamond of yellow silk on another morning that -PRON- have polish the brasswork of -PRON- coat and sponge from the cloth a a to four certain trace of pea soup which have long be in evidence and again that -PRON- torpedo beard have be freshly though bunglingly trim 
heaven know what captain golden mean by this 
the obvious conclusion be too annoying for -PRON- to consider 
nor do miss anstruther pause here in the sacrifice -PRON- be make for vandeleur also be much in -PRON- company and to all appearance rather high in -PRON- good grace 
i rebel in wardly at this and perhaps something of jealousy be mix up in -PRON- 
nevertheless -PRON- be as good as a show to watch the antic of the skipper and vandeleur whenever miss anstruther appear on deck and -PRON- be within hailing distance 
both man would hasten toward -PRON- strive to see which should be first at -PRON- side and the smarting vexa tion of the one that lose the race always fly to the surface 
at such time i have notice the dancing mis chief in the girl hazel eye and read the soft raillery in the demure line of -PRON- face 
natur ally there fall a grow coolness between gold en and vandeleur 
a a to four between two such monopolist as these miss hour on deck be so completely take up that mrs brackett and i have perforce to fall back on each other society for diversion 
i will not say that i fail to enjoy the elderly ladys homely view on life in general and on -PRON- expedition in particular but nevertheless i be conscious of the wax discontent deep down in -PRON- soul 
nearly every day there be period usually brief when miss anstruther and i meet by -PRON- self 
sometimes these come to -PRON- in the cabin sometimes on deck and i begin to observe a change in -PRON- manner as well as in -PRON- talk 
there be a faraway look in -PRON- eye an ex pression halfsad halfdetermine on -PRON- facewhen -PRON- be alone 
for -PRON- too -PRON- conversa tion deal in generality and be burden with constraint 
after a while this line of conduct touch -PRON- pride 
have -PRON- heart not be so intimately con cerne doubtless i should not have begin to avoid -PRON- as i do 
vandeleur continue to sleep in the focsle but resume -PRON- place at the first table in the cabin a a to four soon after miss anstruther begin to notice -PRON- again 
-PRON- have ever a cold eye for -PRON- and if -PRON- notice -PRON- at all -PRON- be by a curt perfunctory nod 
i wonder along toward the end of the out ward voyage if the rivalry and grow coolness between captain golden and vandeleur have any thing to do with the eventless day that troop after the soueaster 
be miss anstruther play a woman part to draw the sting of -PRON- conspiracy 
-PRON- pick up the steady trade about twenty five degree north of the equator and go foam e southeasterly night and day wing and wing -PRON- headsail blanket by the spread of canvas aft 
the ship wellnigh sail -PRON- and after -PRON- morning toiletalway punctilious and thor oughly attend tothe hand idle about in every available scrap of shade 
the skipper get -PRON- timesight in the morning and at noon take the meridian altitude work out longitude and latitude together 
i try to be around while -PRON- prick out course and dis tance on the chart 
-PRON- daily average run in the trade be two a a to four hundred and fifty mile but -PRON- have lose a good deal of time in the light and variable air off the coast 
captain golden have mark a cross on the spot where -PRON- uncharted isle be suppose to lie and i note with quicken pulse each day forward leap toward -PRON- destination 
whenever i mention fortune island the captain vouchsafe -PRON- a sarcastic look out of -PRON- expressive eye sail over this island of -PRON- -PRON- once tell -PRON- an just to convince ye -PRON- isnot there heave the lead an get no bottom 
this be merely talk 
if -PRON- really think there be no such island why have -PRON- and vande leur work together at the beginning of the cruise 
if the island be a myth conspiracy between the two would have be a waste of effort 
the weather grow warm and warm as -PRON- bear southward drop aboard and anderson get dolphin for -PRON- from the knighthead 
this give -PRON- a pleasant variation of -PRON- bill of fare 
for some day i make -PRON- a practise to mingle with the crew during the dogwatch 
-PRON- pre a a to four vious impression that the swede anderson and larsen be the only trustworthy man forward be confirm 
eph the doctor be a morose individual and incline to be quarrelsome 
-PRON- talk but little and -PRON- have a way of avoid a straightforward look that convince -PRON- -PRON- be tricky petie the cabinboy be no well than a wharfrat with all a shortcoming 
allison and minturn the american sailor have the face and hangdog air of a pair of beachcomber 
the kanaka be of a gentle but more crafty type of deepsea criminal and garcia the mexican be no whit well 
all hand regard -PRON- as the walking personi fication of a profitable mystery 
curiosity envy and hostility could be read in the covert glance cast in -PRON- direction 
in all except the swede this mixture of emotion be frankly brutal 
-PRON- investigation forward be make at the time i be seek to avoid miss anstruther 
several time i have see -PRON- alone on the poop look a mute invitation for -PRON- to come aft 
later i reproach -PRON- for -PRON- churlishnesslater when i have discover the cost to -PRON- 
a arter to four on an evening when -PRON- be nearly four week out of san francisco i stand look over the rail watch a phosphorescent glow turn the schooner wake into a pathway of gold 
-PRON- be the mate watch but i do not know where -PRON- be 
the man at the wheel be nod ding and the watch probably asleep on the focslehead 
the strong breeze which have not fail -PRON- for day have drop to a light wind but still come directly over -PRON- taffrail 
i be think as usual of -PRON- strange voyage and speculate upon the mystery to be reveal at the end of -PRON- 
suddenly i become aware that some one be stand near -PRON- likewise peer over the rail into the goldentipped wave 
miss anstruther 
i exclaim 
yes mr lorry -PRON- answer rest -PRON- chin on -PRON- hand and gaze at -PRON- through the semigloom have be want to talk with -PRON- for some time but -PRON- be so preoccupiedshall i say day that -PRON- have be difficult to find the opportunity 
-PRON- own time have be pretty well take up miss anstruther i counter and for a long a a to four time mrs brackett see so much of -PRON- that i be afraid -PRON- have begin to tire of -PRON- company 
and so -PRON- go forward to make a study of the crew 
do the man bear close inspection 
-PRON- be far enough from the wheel to be out of earshot of the helmsman and i could see no one else in -PRON- near vicinity 
two of -PRON- anderson and larsen will bear close inspection say but the rest be rather too much like captain golden 
with -PRON- chin in -PRON- hand -PRON- look off over the heaving sea fancy -PRON- murmur that -PRON- be vex with -PRON- 
perhaps and there be a trace of levity in -PRON- voice -PRON- find -PRON- too good an actress 
i do not reply 
a moment of silence and then -PRON- continue nothing have happenedto -PRON- i mean since -PRON- rough experience during the south easter would rather have face treachery every day from captain golden and vandeleur i burst out -PRON- surge discontent find -PRON- way to -PRON- lip rather thanthan a a to four i pause lamely realize that -PRON- heart be carry -PRON- too far 
-PRON- withdraw -PRON- eye from seaward and for a few moment peer into -PRON- face intently 
when -PRON- finally speak -PRON- be with a throb undernote that set every nerve in -PRON- body to tingle 
do not misconstrue what i have do mr lorry 
-PRON- can not know what -PRON- have cost -PRON- to follow -PRON- advice or how i have reproach -PRON- for -PRON- conduct even while i acknowl edge the sordid wisdom of -PRON- 
yet if -PRON- have safe guard -PRON- in any way -PRON- sacrifice of a life long principle have not be entirely in vain 
there be a sad little quiver in the final word 
one of -PRON- hand have drop to the rail and lie there whitely 
by a quick impulse i drop -PRON- roughened palm over the hand and the next instant -PRON- love for the girl would have be de clare 
quickly however -PRON- withdraw -PRON- hand with a rigid straightening of -PRON- body 
captain golden -PRON- whisper 
the odor of the skipper everlaste stogy be blow back to -PRON- 
-PRON- lounge toward -PRON- a a to carelessly with some remark concern the fail e wind and miss anstruther bid -PRON- a quick good night and go below 
an hour or two later i follow -PRON- light of heart than i have be at any time since the be gin of the voyage 
miss anstruther have virtually admit that all -PRON- have do have be for -PRON- 
from -PRON- dream that night i be awaken in the small hour by a pounding on -PRON- state room door 
recall another time when i have receive a similar summon i answer the call warily 
this time -PRON- be the skipper who stand outside and not the cabinboy 
what be the matter captain golden 
i ask 
matter enough -PRON- cry 
-PRON- con found island be right under -PRON- forefoot and -PRON- shall be on a lee shore in less than a brace of shake unless a miracle happen 
a mess of rock that s what -PRON- island be -PRON- hear the surf 
i do hear -PRON- and -PRON- be boom dangerously near 
-PRON- must have make a phenomenal run since a a to four noon i comment 
-PRON- be impossible that -PRON- should be near the place 
-PRON- must have be off a little in -PRON- reckon -PRON- island that s off -PRON- reckoning -PRON- fume 
but the lookout -PRON- swear roundly 
the lookout be asleep and here -PRON- be drift in there room enough to wear 
room but not wind enough a dead set toward the island and -PRON- impossible to claw off 
tell the woman to get ready for whatever happen an then come on deck 
-PRON- whirl and rush away while i begin scramble into -PRON- clothe 
a close call 
as i hurry from -PRON- stateroom i meet miss anstruther in the cabin 
-PRON- have dress even more quickly than i have do 
i begin to tell -PRON- what have happen hear everything that captain golden say -PRON- interrupt calmly 
if -PRON- want mrs brackett and -PRON- for anything mr lorry -PRON- will find -PRON- ready and wait 
i stare fill with admiration for -PRON- cool ness and courage a brave girl i say as i fling on ward up the companion stair 
when i see the vast shadowy bulk of the island in the dim distance the inexcusable na ture of the skipper blunder be bear in upon -PRON- 
-PRON- have have the deck when -PRON- come to such dangerous quarter with the uncharted coast and even though the lookout be asleep the skip per -PRON- should have be on the alert 
-PRON- have make a mistake in -PRON- reckoningof a a to ur that i be tolerably sure 
perhaps too at the critical moment -PRON- have be steep in one of those reverie of -PRON- and have not awaken to the peril of the ship until too late 
the schooner have be bring by the wind on the good tack to haul offshore and captain golden be anxiously watch the effect of -PRON- change of course 
but the move would not serve 
the current be drag -PRON- three foot toward the reef for every foot that the light wind help -PRON- away from -PRON- 
all hand be on deck silently wait for order 
the mate be in the chain watch the cast of the lead 
no bottom be -PRON- con tinual call 
-PRON- only hope just then seem to lie in find holdingground for -PRON- anchor 
off sounding be the despairing comment of the skipper 
may as well try to run out a line to chiny as to anchor here 
but if the boat be in the water -PRON- whirl on -PRON- with an oath remind -PRON- that i be a passenger that -PRON- devilish cruise be like to cost -PRON- enough and would i put a stopper on -PRON- jawtackle before -PRON- knock -PRON- overboard 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- to come on deck a arter to four and in any other circumstance -PRON- would probably have win a retort in kind 
as -PRON- be i hold -PRON- peace and stare at the smother of foam white in the moonlight toward which -PRON- be rapidly drift 
yet -PRON- be right about the boat 
the current be uncontrollable and -PRON- would have be useless 
reef of the pacific particularly coral reef be usually steepto on -PRON- seaward side so that only a jump take a ship from off sounding right into the breaker 
at that moment i wouldnot have give a copper cent for the lady chance 
quite naturally -PRON- thought of probable dis aster bring mrs brackett and miss anstruther vividly before -PRON- mind 
the skipper would have none of -PRON- advice as to the management of -PRON- ship and so far as the ship be concern -PRON- be welcome to the exercise of -PRON- own judgment good bad or indifferent but in the present in stance bind up with the fate of the schooner be -PRON- life and the life of the two lady 
i have a suggestion to make as helpless ness become more and more apparent 
16o a a to four with -PRON- permission captain say and the help of a couple of hand take the dory from the stern davit pull to leeward and try the sounding a slim chance i know but if -PRON- donot find holdingground somewhere be tween here and the reef well be stove in in less than half an hour 
i could see -PRON- one eye glimmer balefully in the dusk consequently -PRON- answer be a surprise 
go ahead -PRON- growl if -PRON- will be any sat isfaction to -PRON- 
give -PRON- anderson and larsen say -PRON- call the two man aft give -PRON- -PRON- order and the dory be get into the water 
in less than five minute -PRON- be foam to lee ward the swede bend to -PRON- oar while i stand in the sternsheet and make frequent cast with the handlead 
i have already make up -PRON- mind that the island be not of coral formationit bulk too large against the moonlit sky for that 
more likely -PRON- be of volcanic origin and i have hope of get te bottom at some point nearer the outlying reef 
i be presently able to see as well as to hear a a to four the long formidable groundswell as -PRON- break over the rock and churn the space beyond into seethe white 
as i survey the creaming ridge and the cur rent suck -PRON- steadily toward -PRON- i notice what look like a belt of smooth water pierce the line of breaker 
-PRON- be perhaps forty fathom away and i swerve the dory to a course that would lay -PRON- well into the smooth belt hope in -PRON- soul that -PRON- may prove a swashway lead to safe anchorage beyond 
-PRON- surmise be correct 
i get bottom at ten fathom in the swashway and beyond in com paratively quiet water at eight fathom 
this be infinitely more than i have dare to hope for 
the dory be put about and -PRON- fight -PRON- way back through the passage 
the ship be still steer by the wind and still set in toward the reef at frightful speed 
ahoy the schoon 
i call 
well come hoarse response 
have -PRON- steerageway captain golden 
just about 
then follow the dory if -PRON- can and have everything in readiness to anchor 
a a to four do -PRON- know what -PRON- be do lorry shout the skipper 
mind ye donot make a bad matter bad 
a tart reply be on -PRON- tongue but i smoth ere -PRON- back 
for a short space i be in doubt whether golden would adopt -PRON- suggestion then with a feeling of relief i hear -PRON- order the helm up 
slowly the schooner bow fall off then -PRON- begin forge ahead with speed increase by degree 
i keep the dory far enough to wind ward to give the schoon plenty of room then at the right moment -PRON- dart into the passage 
thread that swashway be ticklish business for the lady may but i keep the dory in the lead of -PRON- sounding as -PRON- go 
a few minute take -PRON- beyond the reef and a few minute later the schooner follow 
stand in the sternsheet i watch until the lady may have gain the proper position when i shout for golden to anchor 
the roar of the breaker prevent -PRON- from hear much of what take place on the schooner but i see -PRON- wear smartly with -PRON- headsail and foresail come down 
the main boom be a a to haul amidship as -PRON- come into the wind and then the welcome splash of the anchor shiver through the boom of the surf 
the schooner take -PRON- scope of cable freely and be finally bring up 
i draw a deep breath and tell the man to lay the dory alongside think the old man can thank -PRON- for save the ship sir say anderson 
larsen agree with -PRON- mate and the tone of both -PRON- strike -PRON- carry more respect than an able seaman ever feel for a landsman 
the schooner have a safe enough berth for the present -PRON- lad i answer but -PRON- will be well to hunt a safe one in the morning 
-PRON- should have trouble in plenty if -PRON- cable be to chafe off on sharp rock at the bottom 
as i come over the schooner side the skip per greet be characteristic 
damn lucky i think o have ye go off in the boat an try for sounding say -PRON- the only thing under heaven that save the old hooker 
i let -PRON- go at that and go below 
mrs brack ett sit in one of the cabin chair wring -PRON- a a to four hand 
miss anstruther stand beside -PRON- try e to be of comfort the ship be wreck mr lor ry ask mrs brackett lift -PRON- distressed face to mine 
be -PRON- all go to the bottom 
no indeed mrs brackett i answer cheerily the schooner be safe at anchor and be a good eight fathom from the bottom 
thank goodness 
mrs brackett straight ene up and -PRON- face clear have zelda lookin all around for a corkbelt or whatever -PRON- be -PRON- use when there s a shipwreck 
this be the island -PRON- have come to find be -PRON- 
undoubtedly declare glad of that even if -PRON- do come near bein the end of -PRON- 
-PRON- and miss anstruther have well go back to bed now i advise and get all the rest -PRON- can be work for -PRON- ashore tomor row 
mrs brackett get up and totter toward -PRON- stateroom 
miss anstruther linger to say and -PRON- be -PRON- who save -PRON- mr lorry petie tell -PRON- that much then give -PRON- a daz a a ter to four zling smile before -PRON- turn to follow mrs brackett 
next morning i hear excited voice on deck and hurry up to investigate 
-PRON- cable hadnot partedthat much be evidentand i be at a loss to account for the commotion 
golden stubb and vandeleur be gather in a group by the starboard rail surveying some object through a glass 
this object i could see with -PRON- naked eye be the hull of a wrecked and dismasted boat break across the reef and with -PRON- stern just awash 
some other fellow blunder in here in the dark i reckon observed captain golden care fully study the wreck through the glass be the first letter an the next be now wait till -PRON- roll again 
ah ah 
there -PRON- hand fall to -PRON- side and -PRON- one eye range amazedly from the mate to -PRON- and from -PRON- to vandeleur 
holy mackerel 
why that s the old gazelle o frisco 
vandeleur give a jump and utter an astounded exclamation 
the next moment -PRON- turn slowly around and stare at -PRON- 
an enemy unmask wouldnot give the fagend nothing as the man say pursued captain golden again size up the wreck for chance when -PRON- brigantine hit that bunch o rock 
gene never cross -PRON- hawse but once but that be enough 
i never see such a misbemannered sou mixture o bear bufflo bandi coot an crockydile 
now that jone have pull -PRON- under though i reckon well not think of anythin but the good -PRON- have in -PRON- even if -PRON- do take a mikerscope to find -PRON- 
that wreck get anythin to do with -PRON- business here lorry 
perhaps -PRON- have and perhaps -PRON- hasnot i an swered 
as a matter of fact i do not know -PRON- self although the skipper consider -PRON- reply evasive not of a pryin disposition lorry go on the skipper with a snap of the jaw but -PRON- expectation be go to be knock flat aback if ye donot make up -PRON- mind to be a little more a a ter to four confidin 
i reckon that s all 
while -PRON- take a pasear below mr stubb an hit up the chow -PRON- would better get out one of the boat an look for a well anchorage 
before follow the skipper to the cabin i give the island a critical survey 
-PRON- look bleak enough from seawarda sandy beach border with a broken jumble of rock and back of the rock a steep cliff fifty foot in the sheer 
as far as i could see there be not a patch of green anywhere 
yet certainly this be fortune island 
the wreck of the gazelle bore vague but substantial testimony to that 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther be vastly interested when inform of the wreck 
the former come near to say something that trench directly on -PRON- mission but miss an struther give -PRON- a look that bring -PRON- to -PRON- golden notice the elderly ladys halfslip and the glance that have correct -PRON- 
-PRON- eye glim mere vindictively although -PRON- say nothing 
there be a change in the skipper treatment of miss anstruther for -PRON- be now brusk to the a arter to four verge of insolence 
have -PRON- be skulk about the deck the evening before i ponder and overhear some of the talk between miss an struther and -PRON- 
whether or no this be the case yet the skip per attitude toward the girl start -PRON- temper 
a short step farther and -PRON- should fall afoul of each other 
the mate exploration in the boat be highly successful 
-PRON- report a shelter cove with good holdingground a beach of sand and gravel easy for land andbest of alla safe passage to leeward when -PRON- be ready for sea fortune island lie under the northeast trade and to work out of the swashway against wind and current would have be a difficult proposi tion 
an accessible cove with a passage to lee ward however tide -PRON- over this difficulty 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther be for be row ashore at once 
if the doctor will put -PRON- up a lunch say i to captain golden land and spend the day on the island shouldnot like anything better answer a a to four the skipper than to stretch -PRON- leg on the beach 
an i donot suppose vandeleur will object to a day ashore either 
the lady and i will spend the day on the island alone i observe bluntly and bring golden up with a round turn 
for the work -PRON- be go to do -PRON- wish to have the island to -PRON- and even vandeleur be bar 
well sink -PRON- 
the skipper draw back and take -PRON- sizing ironically 
-PRON- donot have any idea now -PRON- drawl that -PRON- own every un charted turtleback in the two ocean have a very clear idea i frown that i be pay -PRON- good money to obey order 
-PRON- will set mrs brackett miss anstruther and -PRON- ashore this morning and call for -PRON- late in the afternoon 
with that i whirl on -PRON- heel and go to collect some trap which -PRON- be to take with -PRON- 
the impedimenta consist of a hundred foot of stout rope some candle and match tightly wrap in a waterproof cover -PRON- two re volver with a good supply of cartridge and the shortbladed machete 
the doctor have the hamper of food ready a a to four when i come on deck and the lady be wait e 
the dory be alongside man by alli son and minturn with captain golden in the sternsheet 
vandeleur have draw miss an struther apart and be protest wrathfully against be leave behind can do nothing mr vandeleur i hear the girl say 
mr lorry have entire charge and -PRON- and the rest of -PRON- must do exactly as -PRON- think good 
-PRON- interest will not suffer in any way i can promise -PRON- that 
the sailor watch curiously while i throw -PRON- trap into the boat and while i be help the lady over the side and golden be assist -PRON- below 
vandeleur rush up to -PRON- and shake a puny fist in -PRON- face 
by jove -PRON- cry if -PRON- donot act square with -PRON- -PRON- will wish -PRON- have make a show of -PRON- before the man i counsel in a low tone 
and -PRON- may rest assured vandeleur that -PRON- will deal squarely with youin spite of -PRON- trickery and crookedness 
thereupon i gain the boat and -PRON- push off vandeleur look over the side and glare a a ter to four at -PRON- until -PRON- vanish into a narrow high walled passage that lead to the cove 
the mate at the time be make ready to warp the schooner to -PRON- safe anchorage 
the passage between the rock be about ten fathom wide and thirty long 
traverse this -PRON- come out into a little lagoon shelter on all side by high bluff with the leeward channel mention by the mate opening off at the farther end 
in this small but perfect haven the roar of the surf be so deadened that -PRON- could hear the whisper of wave on the shingle 
an ancient volcanic upheaval have split away the northern segment of the island form the lagoon and leave the two channel to east and west 
on -PRON- right be a clifflike wall and on -PRON- left be a smooth slope beach lead up ward to a barren rift in the rock 
the kelpfringe shore give off a salty re freshe odor and i notice a rill of water flow e into the lagoon by a devious course appar ently come out of the cleft above the beach 
but there be no tree no verdure nothing but scoriate rock as far as the eye could reach 
yet the smooth still water the lap of wave on the a a to four gravel the grateful smell of the seaweed the heattempere touch of the tradewind and the prospect of an easy landing with a thrill mys tery near solution bring happiness to miss hazel eye and a look of compla cency to mrs face 
the one jar note be the skipper 
-PRON- be taciturn wear a black scowl and -PRON- single eye flash with ominous portent 
i imagine that -PRON- have not yet recover from -PRON- show of au thority 
-PRON- get the boat to the beach and i assist the lady to land 
i have thrust the revolver through -PRON- belt and after allison have throw out the coil of rope the parcel wrap in oil skin and the machete captain golden spring out on the sand and face -PRON- squarely word with -PRON- say -PRON- savagely 
as the man say one or the other o -PRON- have get to toe the mark an -PRON- high time -PRON- settle which 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther draw closer together the latter set down the ham per which -PRON- have bring from the boat and both regard the skipper with distrust and fore bode 
a a to four suppose say i easily that -PRON- have set tle that point when -PRON- sign -PRON- contract 
what happen afloat an what happen ashore barked golden be two different thing 
-PRON- money pay for the lady may an when yere aboard -PRON- yere cock o the walk 
on solid ground however yere no more to -PRON- than a castaway an -PRON- representative on the schooner be vandeleur 
-PRON- grin fiendishly over the quip 
vandeleur be -PRON- guest i parry sharply and not -PRON- representative 
in which case as captain to do as i see fit 
-PRON- be to anchor the schooner in this cove subject to -PRON- order say i sternly 
anythin ye tell -PRON- on shore go into one ear an out the other -PRON- snarl 
lord -PRON- as ye please on deck but flourish a double fist in -PRON- face probably take -PRON- pat tern from -PRON- any o -PRON- lip an stave in -PRON- headlight 
i turn to the lady 
miss anstruther i request please take mrs brackett and go up to that arroyo yonder 
two the page a a to four as i speak i point to the cleft in the hill above the beach 
no -PRON- object firmly -PRON- will stay right here 
captain and here -PRON- turn appealingly toward golden surely -PRON- understand that -PRON- be as much under mr authority while -PRON- be on the island as -PRON- be while -PRON- be on the ship none o -PRON- putin -PRON- growl duck -PRON- head toward the girl -PRON- any way like to know 
helpin lorry hey 
playin off -PRON- an vandeleur against each other with that glibgabbed tongue o -PRON- i suffer -PRON- to get that far but flesh and blood could stand no more 
i let -PRON- have the weight of -PRON- fist on the point of -PRON- heavy low jaw and -PRON- sprawl backward flat on the sand with heel in the air 
allison and minturn start toward -PRON- but i whip out one of the revolver and -PRON- drop back 
avast -PRON- two 
i cry sharply 
help the skipper into the boat and pull back to the schoon the word -PRON- lad 
captain golden lay heave on the beach like a a a to four gudgeon that have be overlong out of the water 
-PRON- be stunned and bewilder almost uncon scious 
the sailor lift -PRON- into the boat push off tumble aboard -PRON- and fall to with the oar 
i put the coil of rope over -PRON- shoulder pick up the oilskin parcel the machete and the hamper and start up the slope of the beach 
come miss anstruther say bring mrs brackett and let -PRON- go about -PRON- work shouldnot have do that mr lor ry murmur the girl a mist of tear in -PRON- eye as -PRON- look after the retreat boat 
-PRON- push -PRON- beyond endurance i answer shortly know but -PRON- wasnot policy 
there be time miss anstruther when -PRON- be a man part to throw policy to the wind 
that be one of the time 
then i march on up the slope -PRON- compan ion follow slowly and talk excitedly as -PRON- come 
a gruesome fend 
miss anstruther be right 
lay violent hand on the skipper at that stage of -PRON- under take be far from be good policy 
yet give the same excuse i should have repeat the lesson and defy the consequence 
i couldnot understand what have come over the man 
i know -PRON- be fond of -PRON- bottle and i have be tell that -PRON- go to excess with -PRON- when in port or when lay up elsewhere so the schooner could spare -PRON- and i could only imagine that -PRON- have take a drop too much that morning 
-PRON- be a bad beginning for -PRON- work on the island and i feel sure -PRON- companion would be depress by -PRON- 
at the opening of the cleft through the hill i pause and wait for the lady to come up with -PRON- 
as -PRON- be come slowly i have time to lay down the stuff i be carry and climb to the high bank 
from that elevated point i obtain a good view of the entire island 
-PRON- be small and light a a to tle more than the top of a submarine mountain push above the surface of the sea 
in shape the island be an irregular circle higher toward the west and diminish in a series of step toward the east 
-PRON- whole ex tent be cross and recrosse with rocky and dismally barren ridge 
follow the angling cleave with -PRON- eye i observe farther eastward a thin strip of green grass border the brook 
this be all the herbage i could see 
there be a bend in the cleft however just beyond the grass and what lie farther on could only be ascertain by investigation 
slip down the sterile hillside i rejoin -PRON- compan ion 
do -PRON- see -PRON- promised land from up there mr lorry ask miss anstruther seek bravely to hide the perturbation arouse by the affair on the beach 
-PRON- be a very barren land i smile so far as tropical island go 
still -PRON- do not come here hunt breadfruit and coconut so -PRON- have no cause to feel discouraged 
the most promising a a to four thing on the island be this valley and -PRON- will fol low the brook 
before pick up -PRON- burden i knelt and take a drink of the water 
-PRON- be deliciously cool and sweet 
open the hamper i take out a tin cup and fill -PRON- for mrs brackett 
mrs brackett be not so successful at hide -PRON- feeling as be miss anstruther and -PRON- continue to be very nervous and excited 
never theless between -PRON- miss anstruther and i suc ceede in calm -PRON- fear 
a hundred yard bring -PRON- to the narrow carpet of grass and another hundred yard take -PRON- around the turn in the valley 
here -PRON- make a discovery indeed for -PRON- come upon a small hut evidently build of material from the wreck of the gazelle house cry mrs brackett then impel by a wild but pathetic impulse -PRON- hurry for ward call tom 
tom 
miss anstruther and linger behind for a moment exchange sad glance isnot possible there be any one here be -PRON- mr lorry the girl ask think no doubt of the possibility of find -PRON- brother 
a a to four i shake -PRON- head 
if -PRON- find any one here -PRON- would probably be some one from the wreck of the gazelle say and -PRON- may be sure that if there be any castaway on the island -PRON- would long since have make -PRON- known to -PRON- 
i note the hut wonderingly as -PRON- approach 
-PRON- be side with sandalwood strip and roof with a couple of hatchcover rotten tarpaulin fill out the space between the wall 
a section of cabin skylight serve for a window and the door have evidently once close the entrance to a stateroom 
a stovepipe project from the roof 
the hut contain but a single room and there be four berth arrange against the wall in two tier 
the floor be of sand and a table stand in the center of -PRON- with four chair place one at each side in orderly fashion 
at one end of the room be a galley stove 
not far from the stove be a boxcupboard swing against the wall 
neatly pile in the cup board be four tin plate four tin cup four spoon four knife and fork 
in a corner close to the cupboard be a pile of tin meat and vegetable also a bag of a a to four moldy ship bread overturn and spill out on the floor 
there be blanket in the bunk and a smoky smell about the interior of the hut that suggest human habitation 
miss anstruther and i stand just within the door while -PRON- make -PRON- survey 
mrs brackett -PRON- wild hope disappoint lean dispiritedly against the table 
tom ainot here -PRON- say dully there ainot any one here 
-PRON- didnot really expect to find -PRON- son do -PRON- mrs brackett 
i ask gently 
why not -PRON- burst out 
why shouldnot i expect to find tom i want to know -PRON- think -PRON- have anything to do with send -PRON- here mr lorry 
who send -PRON- here be still a mystery as well as why -PRON- be send here 
the teakwood case begin miss an struther and pause 
the ten teakwood case i finish -PRON- shall doubtless find in the seacavern 
what -PRON- contain will probably be -PRON- sole reward for com e here 
apart from thatand even that be suppositionwe know nothing 
a a to ur all the furnishing of the hut suggest miss anstruther seem to be make up of group of four 
plainly -PRON- deduce with a specula tive air there be four survivor of the wreck of the gazelle 
and i would hazard the opinion i add that those four be captain eugene trent archibald anstruther thomas brackett and ar thur mayhew 
if -PRON- boy be here demand mrs brack ett -PRON- reason obscure by hope and anxiety then why ainot -PRON- here now 
perhaps -PRON- be all take away by a ship say miss anstruther 
if -PRON- be take away by a ship -PRON- would have come home to -PRON- persist mrs brackett 
no -PRON- go on after a moment -PRON- voice quiver with conviction if tom be here then -PRON- s here nowand go to find -PRON- 
the poor woman for whose grief and despair miss anstruther and i have nothing but deep compassion leave the hut and start along a faint path that lead onward down the slope of the bleak valley 
miss anstruther and i follow -PRON- 
a pile of broken and splintered wreckage lie a a to four back of the hut and seemingly have furnish the castaway with firewood 
not far from the wreckage the ground be litter with empty meat and vegetable tin 
the castaway whoever -PRON- be i ven ture must have remain on the island for some time 
this pathway be well worn and be still easily follow although month must have pass since -PRON- be last use 
miss anstruther do not answer 
-PRON- head be bow in pensive thought 
mrs brackett be not the only one to be grievously disap pointed 
the girl i know have entertain hope of find -PRON- brother somewhere along that trail of mystery 
the path end at a spring which bubble out of the rock drop into a pool and then trick lead away down the valley 
mrs brackett have keep on and vanish from sight around another turn that lie ahead of -PRON- 
miss anstruther and i follow suddenly ac celerate -PRON- pace when a plaintive griefstrick en cry smote upon -PRON- ear from the distance 
wonder and fearful -PRON- hasten around a a a to four project spur of rock and find mrs brackett upon -PRON- knee beside an oblong mound 
there be four of the mound for the sig nificant grouping of four be carry out even here 
at each mound be a headboard neatly square and neatly letter 
each character in the several inscription have be painstakingly carve in the wood 
the legend on the headboard of the first grave where mrs brackett be kneel read thus sacred to the memory of thomas brackett who die of injury receive during the wreck of the gazelle 
miss anstruther and i read the inscription and pass slowly on to the next grave 
here the inscription be identically the same except that the board bear the name of archibald an struther 
the girl lean against the head board and bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
i go on to the next mound 
under that lay captain eugene trent who have likewise meet -PRON- end through the wrecking of -PRON- illfate brigantine 
there be no one to mourn for captain trent 
even have vandeleur be there there would have a a to be no sorrowing over the grave of the dead skipper 
the next mound i feel sure would hide one of -PRON- own kin 
but in this i be mistake 
the headboard mark the final restingplace of three sailor whose body have be wash ashore 
i stand beside that last grave and ponder 
what have become of -PRON- cousin arthur may hew -PRON- must have be -PRON- who have lay away the other and have erect the headboard with -PRON- inscription 
naturally there would have be mo one leave to perform the last sad rite when -PRON- turn come 
why have -PRON- not find -PRON- remain in the hut 
surely there if anywhere -PRON- end would have overtake -PRON- 
then come another thought have not the same hand that have lay away these man and so carefully commemorate -PRON- last restingplace be the one to send those four card -PRON- sev eral way 
if such be the case then arthur mayhew a a to must still be among the living 
yet if so why be -PRON- not there in person 
why have -PRON- quar tere that card of instruction 
above all why be -PRON- not claim -PRON- share of the content suppose to be in the ten teakwood case 
the word be sometimes inadequate to express -PRON- true feeling 
i find -PRON- so in try to do full justice to zelda courage and helpfulness at this dark period of -PRON- fortune 
-PRON- gruesome discovery shock -PRON- into reali zation of the vanity of earthly aim and ambi tion 
i need the lesson and profit by -PRON- 
of late -PRON- mind have be grow more and more sordid in deal with the outcome of -PRON- expedition 
there be fortune to be have at the rainbow end and the thought of mere gain be always brutalize 
the sight of those two woman in tear touch and soften -PRON- 
if -PRON- enterprise accomplish nothing more than a knowledge of the fate of a son and a brother even yet -PRON- be worth the price -PRON- have pay in money and hardship 
in a little while miss anstruther come to -PRON- side 
-PRON- be -PRON- calm brave self again and suggest that -PRON- get mrs brackett back to the a a to four hut 
miss anstruther think that -PRON- could minister to the poor woman and stem the torrent of -PRON- grief with more success if -PRON- be re move from that heartbreake spot 
i silently acquiesce and -PRON- support mrs brackett to the spring and back along the path to the cabin 
an hour later when the distraught woman begin to gain some control over -PRON- -PRON- have luncheon 
after luncheon i pick up -PRON- coil of rope -PRON- oilskin parcel and -PRON- machete excuse -PRON- for a time and start for the door 
where be -PRON- go mr lorry ask miss anstruther 
to investigate the seacavern 
-PRON- look worried 
must -PRON- do that today 
i hate to have -PRON- go alone and yet i feel as though -PRON- finish with a significant glance at the bowed head of -PRON- companion 
-PRON- be in such a state of uncertainty with regard to captain golden i answer that i feel as though -PRON- should be no longer about -PRON- work than be absolutely necessary 
what i be a art to four go to do now i can do good alone 
will -PRON- remain here until i come back 
-PRON- look at -PRON- steadily for a moment 
yes -PRON- reply 
i hesitate for a space then draw one of -PRON- revolver from -PRON- belt and lay -PRON- on the table 
so far as i can see i go on there be not the least reason in the world why -PRON- should need that but nevertheless i be go to leave -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- will feel safe 
-PRON- thank -PRON- with a glance and i go on out of the cabin and start eastward along the valley 
at the spur beyond the spring i look back 
miss anstruther stand in the doorway watch e -PRON- 
-PRON- start suddenly to withdraw as i turn but pause and wave -PRON- hand encour agingly 
i lift -PRON- hat to -PRON- then face about and strode onward 
pass the headboard which stand as so many mute detail of the great mystery i ha stene -PRON- step and come finally to a place where the valley angle sharply to the south and to the sea 
climb the eastern slope of the angle i to a flat crest whose wall drop sheer a a to four downward to the breaker 
somewhere in that wall should be the entrance to the seacavern 
this the easternmost scrap of the island measure no more than five hundred foot across 
the average drop to sealevel from the brow of the cliff i judge to be about fifty foot 
to locate the mouth of the cavern properly a boat should have be use with two stout oar man like the swede 
for -PRON- a boat be mani festly out of the question inasmuch as the use of one would have give every man in the schoon an inkling of -PRON- business 
later -PRON- may be a boat would have to be use but not until i have investigate the cavern and map out a suitable course of procedure 
just now -PRON- business be to find the opening into the wall 
look downward the wall -PRON- give no suggestion of a breach 
but what the wall fail to tell the break wave make manifest 
there be one spot directly below a point mid way across the top of the cliff where the wave do not break against the rock 
there be no spray supposably because the wave find no obstruction to break against 
in other word the ioo a a ter to ur sea rush unimpeded into the mouth of the cav lie flat down on the top of the cliff i let -PRON- eye rove searchingly across the face of the wall 
a shelflike ledge jut out from the rock above the turmoil of the wave although well within reach of the spindrift 
the shelf could not be more than two foot across at the wide and scarcely more than six foot in length 
-PRON- offer foothold however and a point of vantage for further discovery 
rise to -PRON- foot i look around -PRON- and to the westward where the schooner be anchor 
the rise rock in that direction hide the ship entirely 
i be alone and unwatched and could proceed with -PRON- work 
-PRON- first move be to make the end of the rope fast to a boulder which lie on the brink and al most over the shelf 
in order to keep the rope from chafe against the sharp edge of the boul der i pad -PRON- with -PRON- coat on the side that be to receive the brunt of the pull 
also i cush ione the angle over which the rope turn down ward with -PRON- hat 
then i strip off -PRON- shoe and shirt tie a a to the oilskin packet to the back of -PRON- belt with -PRON- cotton handkerchief slip the machete into the front of the belt near the revolver and lower -PRON- over the brink 
use to ropework as i be the downward climb be not difficult 
i be pleased to note too that -PRON- old wound do not bother -PRON- 
a few minute bring -PRON- to the shelf and to -PRON- intense satisfaction i find that the shelf hang directly alongside the mouth of the cavern 
so far everything have go swimmingly and i be not long in discover that the rest of -PRON- work would have to go swimmingly if i want to get inside the cavern 
from -PRON- limited base of operation i gath ere that the opening into the cliff be perhaps forty foot across with -PRON- top a dozen foot above the smooth water 
pull off -PRON- stocking and weight -PRON- down on the ledge with the ma chete and the revolver i tie a bowline knot in the end of the rope push the rope through the loop and draw the bight taut around -PRON- body under the arm 
possibly i have thirty foot of leeway before i should take up all the slack of -PRON- lifeline 
this a a to four i hope would be enough to land -PRON- on the sub terranean beach of the cavern 
with a final look upward to make sure that all be right i slip from the ledge and be -PRON- be mediately suck into the black maw of the cav ern with dizzy swiftness 
so fierce be the inset of the wave that the current -PRON- upbore -PRON- with very little swimming 
when i bring up at the end of the rope -PRON- be with a jar that almost dislocate -PRON- neck 
for a few moment i bob up and down like a hooked fish the spray from the break current nearly smother -PRON- 
then i begin swim in good earnest de scribe an arc about the bend of the rope at the cavernmouth 
i be thirty foot from daylight and the darkness be so intense that i could not see -PRON- hand before -PRON- eye 
i swam into a wall to -PRON- left but -PRON- be an overhang wall with the bottom of -PRON- wear away by action of the water 
i sound ho ping to touch bottom but fail in -PRON- expecta tion and propel -PRON- to the surface again 
presently i strike out for the opposite side of the cavern and there -PRON- foot ground in sand a a to four and i grope -PRON- dripping way up a slope through thick darkness 
as soon as i find -PRON- clear of the water i sink down to rest and recover breath before continue farther 
in five minute i have take -PRON- match and candle from -PRON- waterproof covering and have strike a light 
the candle gleam fight ifeebly with the opaque gloom 
nothing short of a powerful arclight could have give -PRON- an in stantaneous and comprehensive view of -PRON- situa tion 
stygian wave roll out of a wall of shadow break over the sand at -PRON- foot 
an impenetrable curtain seem to surround and shut -PRON- in over head and on all side 
the hollow roar of the surf echo and rever berate thunderously between the rocky wall 
walk up the gloomy beach i gain the wall at ten pace 
keep close to the perpendicular rock i traverse an irregular halfcircle before i again find -PRON- way bar by the break surf 
i have skirt the confine of the underground beach and have reach the overhang wall i page a a ter to four which have defy -PRON- just within the cavern mouth 
turn back i retrace -PRON- course at a dis tance of some two yard from the wall 
not more than fifty pace from the turningpoint i stumble against something 
i stoop and sweep the candlelight over the object 
a box 
one of the teakwood case 
as though under violent compression the breath rush from -PRON- lung and seem to carry every ounce of -PRON- strength with -PRON- 
i sink down on the box and the candle shiver in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- have find the island the uncharted island lie where -PRON- mysterious instruction have place -PRON- 
i have find the cavern situate at the island eastern extremity and here in the cav ern i have come upon the teakwood case 
as step by step -PRON- have follow -PRON- strange clue i could look back and see that -PRON- confidence in the final result have wax strong and strong as -PRON- proceed 
i have expect to find the teakwood case so i be at a loss to account for that sudden rush of weakness when i do find -PRON- 
there be fortune in those ten box 
what a a ter to four the treasure consist of i do not know yet i could have stake -PRON- life that an equal division of -PRON- mean fortune for four of -PRON- 
but be there ten box 
-PRON- conviction in this regard be as firm as in every other never theless i spring up on the instant and investi gate 
yes there be ten case in five pile of two each 
i try to push one of the upper box with -PRON- free hand 
-PRON- resist the push like so much solid iron 
set down the candle i take both hand to the box 
i lift -PRON- barely 
the weight i place roughly at one hundred and fifty pound 
spur by feverish curiosity i hunt for a stone intent on break open one of the box to see what -PRON- contain 
i find the stone but the strong black wood resist -PRON- effort 
each box be strongly make and cross four time with band of strapiron 
only a cold chisel and hammer could have force one of the -PRON- be useless for -PRON- to remain in the cavern any longer 
i have find out all that i could and have make assurance doubly sure 
the next step a a to -PRON- be to consult with miss anstruther and devise way and mean for get the treasure aboard the lady may and safeguard -PRON- against a venomous skipper a treacherous companion and a piratical crew 
this be a task to call for all -PRON- tact shrewdness and courage 
with a final look at the black case shimmer e like ebony under the candle light i go back to the place where i have leave the end of -PRON- lifeline anchor to a stone 
the line be there 
whether -PRON- be high tide in the cavern or not i do not know but i care fully stow -PRON- reserve supply of candle and match high up in a niche of the rocky wall 
the halfconsume candle i plant upright in the sand and leave burn 
i could watch -PRON- as a beacon while -PRON- way along the rope and against the current 
place the loop over -PRON- head i drop -PRON- to -PRON- armpit and pull -PRON- tight then i throw -PRON- self into the water and begin draw at the rope 
-PRON- yield so readily to the pull that i mar vele at the amount of slack lie between -PRON- and the mouth of the cavern 
from marvel -PRON- mind leap to doubt from a a ter to doubt to fear and from fear to the horror of a supreme conviction 
the other end of the rope have be cast from -PRON- fastening at the brink of the cliff 
stagger ashore with the limp rope in -PRON- hand i sprawl backward at full length on the sand -PRON- stony eye on the mocking flicker of the candle 
the jaw of death 
all that the loosening of the rope signify do not appear at once 
as -PRON- power to reason re turn the vista of probability open with a plausible deadliness that take -PRON- breath 
i have protect the cliff end of the rope so well that i know -PRON- have not chafe apart 
neverthe less i haul -PRON- in foot by foot until i have the end in -PRON- hand and could examine -PRON- 
the wide loop be just as i have tie -PRON- 
-PRON- have be lift bodily over the top of the boulder and cast from the cliff 
with this to start from -PRON- line of probabili tie develop 
i have be watch when i make the descent to the cavern and some oneit may have be captain golden or -PRON- may have be hope to make an end of -PRON- by displace the rope 
-PRON- be back again to the situation as -PRON- stand on the lady may at the time of the noreast 
by eliminate -PRON- golden and vandeleur could a a to four work -PRON- will with the treasure and mrs brackett and miss anstruther would be power less to interfere 
but there be more to the present situation than that 
i have be see go into the cavern and this would point -PRON- enemy indubitably to the heart of -PRON- mission 
captain golden and vandeleur would come to that seacubicle by boat 
should i remain there unarmed as i be and allow -PRON- to kill -PRON- out of hand 
there be too much for -PRON- to live for 
i think of zelda anstruther and then again of the teakwood box 
if i live i may yet be able to protect mrs and miss interest no less than -PRON- own 
but in order to live i must not be catch in that cavern like a rat in a trap 
some thought of secrete the case occur to -PRON- but -PRON- be too large too heavy and the cavern offer no opportunity for secret stowing 
i may have roll -PRON- into the water but not know what -PRON- content be fear to take the risk 
no i would leave the case where -PRON- be a a to four and struggle to get away from the cavern 
and just here the enormity of the task unfold -PRON- 
i should have to battle with the current if i breast -PRON- successfully there be the pounding of the wave against the outer wall to be en dure resist that i have still the shelf to gain and finally there be fifty foot of sheer cliff between the shelf and safety 
as for the current i be a strong swimmer and -PRON- strength may even withstand the buf fete against the outside rock 
so far as re gain the shelf be concern i observe that the tide be rise and that -PRON- be creep high and higher up on the dark sand this would bring the surface of the sea nearer the shelf perhaps near enough for -PRON- to gain -PRON- without the rope 
once on the shelf i should have a revolver to -PRON- hand and if golden and vandeleur come in a boat i would be able to give a good account of -PRON- 
have hit upon a plan of action i set -PRON- immediately to carry -PRON- out 
traverse the beach until i have get as close as possible to the cavern mouth i take to the water and begin swim 
a a to four the current be not so strong from which i imagine that the tide be near the flood yet -PRON- be strong enough to make -PRON- work diffi cult in the extreme 
however i forge slowly ahead gain on the current inch by inch 
when i be well within the narrow wall of the entrance the heave of a wave throw -PRON- sharply against the rock 
grasp the rough projection of the wall i support -PRON- for a brief rest 
the wall give -PRON- an idea and when i resume -PRON- progress toward the light -PRON- be by reach from one projection to another and draw -PRON- self forward 
this call for the expenditure of a good deal of strength yet not so much as though i be swim in the middle of the channel 
-PRON- be probably half an hour before i reach the mouth of the cavern and find -PRON- clutch e a slippery point of rock in the outer wall 
above -PRON- be the shelf but -PRON- be not within reach 
again and again i lift -PRON- and try to catch at the flat edge 
the incoming wave hove -PRON- with sicken force against the jagging a a to granite and always i miss the top of the shelf by two or three inch and fall back 
with muscular power go fast and spirit flag i begin debate the advisability of re turn to the cavern to rest until the tide should be at the flood when -PRON- may be i could make a second attempt with well success 
in that dis couraging moment a nameless horror come zig zagge from seaward glide toward -PRON- by a series of tack 
what i see with terrordistended eye be a tall triangular fin the dorsal fin of a shark 
for a brief instant -PRON- whole body go lax then i give a frenzied yell and seek to dig -PRON- way up the slippery rock 
-PRON- hand be tear with the desperate effort and the slapping wave roll back from the cliff tinge with the blood of -PRON- wound 
the mon ster scent the blood rip toward -PRON- through the water the fin part -PRON- like a black streak 
i fall away from -PRON- insecure handhold 
use less useless be -PRON- agonize think a min ute half a minute and i should be pluck from the cliff face 
a a to four i know how pearldiver fight the shark drop ping below -PRON- as -PRON- rush and disembowel -PRON- with the thrust of a keen blade 
but a brown or a black man be safe from a shark a white man never 
still if i have have the machete lie on the shelf above -PRON- heaven know that no ex pedient would have be too desperate for -PRON- to attempt 
without the machete i be as good as lose 
i close -PRON- eye 
i do not think of the treacherous skipper or vandeleur or the treasure in that supreme moment i think only of zelda an struther 
robert 
the rope 
quick 
be i dream 
have thought of the girl bring the fancy of -PRON- voice in -PRON- ear 
something strike on the rock beside -PRON- 
open -PRON- eye i find the object to be the end of a rope 
i do not look have no time 
grip the stout hempen strand i lift -PRON- frantic ally toward the shelf 
for one horrid instant the awful fascination of death in -PRON- most grue some form hold -PRON- supine at the end of the rope halfin and halfout of the water 
a a to four hurry shriek the voice above 
i throw off the lethargy that have enchain -PRON- limb 
with one quick heave i lay -PRON- across the shelf 
a clash come from behind -PRON- 
turn -PRON- head i notice two bow of serrated tooth inter lock catch a glimpse of an ugly gray head and see two stare baffled eye drop back under the water 
a groan be wrench from -PRON- lip and i straighten out on the narrow shelf 
treachery 
i may have lie five minute on that shelf with the spray beat over -PRON- or -PRON- may have be half an hour 
spend and horrorshaken as i be time pass unheeded 
finally i become aware that miss anstruther be call down to -PRON- -PRON- voice quiver with fear and dread 
robert robert 
why donot -PRON- speak 
why donot -PRON- answer -PRON- 
be -PRON- hurt 
i rise to -PRON- knee and look up all right zelda i call back to -PRON- 
-PRON- save -PRON- life 
but for that rope i should have be a dead man by this time 
oh i do not want -PRON- to come here alone 
i tell -PRON- that i do not 
somehow i have a feel e that all would not go well with -PRON- 
how will -PRON- get up here 
climb the rope 
can -PRON- 
do -PRON- feel strong enough 
a a to -PRON- -PRON- be pleasant to have -PRON- so concerned about -PRON- welfare 
in -PRON- voice in -PRON- manner i read plainly that -PRON- care for -PRON- 
-PRON- strength return with a bound and i be ready to laugh at the danger that lie behind no less than at those to come strong enough to dare anything zelda i shout cheerfully 
just see that the upper end of the rope be secure and be at -PRON- side in a jiffy 
i see -PRON- fall to at the upper end of the rope take one halfhitch after another and belay over all 
while -PRON- be engage in this i be draw on -PRON- stocking and slip revolver and machete into -PRON- belt be sure -PRON- will hold now -PRON- call down 
be sure and hang tightthe shark be swim around off the ledge 
the triangular fin as i see be weave back ward and forward just awash 
that shark have have -PRON- last chance at -PRON- i laugh grip the rope 
here i come zelda 
up i go hand over fist come too a arter to four close to the edge i pant as the girl bend down to catch -PRON- arm and help -PRON- over the brink 
when i have gain the flat surface of the cliff top and while i be halfrecline against the boulder to catch -PRON- breath zelda fall at -PRON- side bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand and begin sob 
there there little girl say i soothingly -PRON- bare arm go about -PRON- waist all over now all over now -PRON- answer brokenly think of what may have happen miss be as good as a mile i jest gaily 
just keep -PRON- face in -PRON- hand please till i get into -PRON- shirt and coat and then -PRON- will go back to the hut 
i have something to tell -PRON- and i know -PRON- have a good deal to tell -PRON- 
the walk up the valley will be just the thing for a little exchange of information 
i be not long get into -PRON- clothe and shoe 
-PRON- hat fortunately have not drop into the sea but lie on the cliff edge 
now say as i coil in the rope -PRON- have use please tell -PRON- where -PRON- get this line 
-PRON- be hang in the hut mr lorry a a ter to four that wonot do i object with a smile and a shake of the head 
-PRON- give -PRON- a puzzled glance 
what wonot do -PRON- query 
the rope be that part of -PRON- be well enough -PRON- the mr lorry part 
-PRON- just establish a prece dent by call -PRON- robert 
please keep -PRON- up 
the color mount -PRON- cheek be so excited -PRON- murmur avert -PRON- eye that i hardly know what i say or do be excite too but i distinctly remember the robert part of what -PRON- say 
i sling the rope over -PRON- shoulder 
now as -PRON- go back i add -PRON- may begin the talk have a foreboding when -PRON- leave the hut -PRON- begin drop in at -PRON- side as -PRON- de scend the slope toward the valley and i be that why -PRON- watch from the door way zelda 
i rally 
so that -PRON- may see the last of -PRON- 
-PRON- blush again prettily 
as -PRON- be the sole protector of two lone woman -PRON- reason demurely -PRON- be very a arter to four natural that -PRON- safety should be a prime con sideration 
oh 
i mutter 
-PRON- have be go only a few moment -PRON- proceed when captain golden and mr van deleur look in at the door of the hut 
mrs brackett and i be startle of course but -PRON- say nothing not here the skipper growl with a fierce look 
ask the girl say vandeleur shell know where -PRON- be 
captain golden do ask -PRON- and i tell -PRON- the truth that i do not know where -PRON- be 
oh well well find -PRON- 
captain golden de clare and -PRON- and vandeleur go on down the valley be alarm for i feel sure the skipper in tend do -PRON- some injury on account of what happen on the beach this morning 
so -PRON- follow the skipper and vandeleur out of -PRON- sight so -PRON- would not know i be watch -PRON- 
i take this with -PRON- 
-PRON- smile and for the first time i see that -PRON- have the revolver i have leave with -PRON- 
whether i should have use -PRON- or not if there have be nee i donot know 
possibly when -PRON- ad a a to four come to the pinch i should have exercise a woman prerogative andfainte 
not -PRON- i demur admiringly 
well i follow the skipper and vandeleur -PRON- go on and see -PRON- reach the top of the cliff look downward and apparently study what lie below 
-PRON- talk earnestly together and i hear captain golden give a fierce laugh as -PRON- lift the rope and throw -PRON- from the boulder 
directly afterward the two leave the cliff and hurry back up the valley 
as soon as -PRON- be go i go to the ledge and look over to see for -PRON- 
-PRON- revolver and machete be plainly to be see on the narrow ledge and -PRON- knowledge of -PRON- instruction make -PRON- positive that -PRON- have go into the cavern 
i call to -PRON- but of course -PRON- could not hear -PRON- 
then i reflect that -PRON- would need a rope when -PRON- come out so i run back to the hut to get one that i have see hang there get back just in time -PRON- finish after a brief silence and -PRON- know the rest 
now what do -PRON- find in the cavern 
ten teakwood box i reply and each of -PRON- will weigh a hundred and fifty pound 
i a a ter to -PRON- clap -PRON- hand and -PRON- hazel eye glow with excitement and delight 
then -PRON- be really there 
what be in -PRON- mr lorry shall not answer that question until -PRON- re vise -PRON- term i aver with mock displeasure 
now donot be provoke robert 
that will do i smile donot know what be in the box zelda 
-PRON- face fall in disap pointment 
-PRON- see i explain have to swim into the cavern so i couldnot burden -PRON- with anything that would help pry up the cover 
i do use a stone but the box be bind with strapiron and strongly nail 
-PRON- must be treasure 
undoubtedly 
-PRON- sigh softly be so glad -PRON- whis pere 
do the treasure mean so much to -PRON- 
i ask 
more than -PRON- can know 
i have a young brother to support and -PRON- have be a hard strug gle for -PRON- to take care of -PRON- sincesince ar chie cease to share the burden 
a a to four i echo -PRON- sigh for i know that the treasure be recede farther and farther from -PRON- 
mrs brackett too go on zelda be in sore need of money 
-PRON- have nothing and there be a mortgage on the home -PRON- husband leave -PRON- 
the treasure and here -PRON- wave -PRON- hand to ward the stark headboard which -PRON- be pass 1ng be a heritage from those who lie there 
who know but that -PRON- may have go down to death in seek to save the treasure for -PRON- 
zelda say i soberly -PRON- have ask -PRON- to keep nothing from -PRON- 
shall i do that now even though -PRON- may dash -PRON- hope 
-PRON- halt with a start and gaze steadily into -PRON- face 
yes -PRON- answer slowly have earn the right to know all have i not 
-PRON- have and i be sure -PRON- will appreciate the situation and make the good of -PRON- as soon as i call -PRON- attention to one fact after cast the rope from the boulder captain golden and vandeleur hurry off toward the schooner 
yes 
can -PRON- not imagine why -PRON- do that 
-PRON- have study the face of the cliff -PRON- have a a ter to four detect the presence of the cavern -PRON- be sure that i be inside the cavern and and -PRON- want to get boat come back and deal with -PRON- below there as -PRON- see fit 
the girl shiver 
who would believe there could be such scoundrel 
that be partly -PRON- object i admit to find -PRON- in the cavern unarmed and at -PRON- mercy 
-PRON- have another object too for -PRON- certainly infer that the cavern contain some thing that have bring -PRON- to the island 
if -PRON- explore the place as -PRON- undoubtedly will -PRON- can not help find the box 
when -PRON- do find -PRON- -PRON- will mean that -PRON- will consider nothing but -PRON- own gain 
in other word i firmly believe that the treasure be lose to -PRON- 
-PRON- would not dare -PRON- breathe with flame eye 
man like captain golden will dare anything 
-PRON- be make a dupe and a tool of vandeleur and i be certain that vandeleur will never get -PRON- share of the treasure either 
-PRON- will know too much for captain welfare and to push -PRON- overboard in the night will be easy 
the official log would show that -PRON- be lose a arter to through -PRON- own carelessness or sweep away in a gale 
but if -PRON- be on board -PRON- will not be on board zelda 
unless something like a miracle happen -PRON- and i and mrs brackett will never step foot on the lady may again 
then a miracle will happen robert 
heaven never yet prosper such rascal as captain gold en and vandeleur 
somehow some way -PRON- shall all of -PRON- receive -PRON- due hope so at least shall not yield with out a fight 
what will -PRON- do will leave -PRON- to explain matter and go down to the cove in order to find out if possible what be go on aboard the schooner 
please donot -PRON- beg 
robert 
every thing depend on -PRON- now even more than ever 
if -PRON- go down to the cove and captain golden should deal treacherously with -PRON- as -PRON- have al ready do and will continue to do think what would become of mrs brackett and -PRON- 
-PRON- be near the hut by that time 
-PRON- foot have be lag on the way ever since -PRON- have a a to -PRON- pass the bend in the valley and strike into the path that lead from the spring be think of -PRON- always zelda i whis pere 
if i have not meet -PRON- in that san fran cisco hotel i firmly believe that i should not have follow up this hazy and extravagant venture 
in go to the cove i be think of -PRON- inter est even more than i be of -PRON- own 
a warm light break over -PRON- beautiful face -PRON- eye dim with gather tear and -PRON- sensitive lip tremble ever so slightly 
then robert -PRON- say softly since -PRON- know how much -PRON- welfare mean to -PRON- i feel that i can trust -PRON- to go 
-PRON- hand be red with the wound inflict on -PRON- by the rock -PRON- hair be dripping and tangle about -PRON- eye and take altogether i be not very presentable even for an adventurer 
but i fling -PRON- arm about -PRON- draw -PRON- close and press -PRON- lip to her 
-PRON- flutter away from -PRON- and off to the cabin door and as i lose -PRON- around the next turn of the valley -PRON- be there watch and wave -PRON- hand -PRON- face flush and -PRON- eye like star 
a a to there be other treasure apart from those to be find in teakwood box treasure beside which the pure gold and the rare pearl be not to be consider 
for -PRON- i would not have barter that one moment joy for the con tent of all the teakwood box under heaven 
maroon 
the schooner lie snugly at anchor in the cove 
no sign of life appear about -PRON- deck and i hail lustily 
mr stubb rise lazily from behind the bul wark 
evening be draw on and while -PRON- be plain to -PRON- i be somewhat in the shadow and -PRON- appear in doubt as to -PRON- identity 
alloy the shore -PRON- call lean over the rail 
what do -PRON- want 
this be lorry mr stubb i shout wish -PRON- would send off a boat and take -PRON- aboard 
there ainot any boat mr lorry 
no boat become of -PRON- all 
i know that the schooner have three boat one at the stern davit and two on the deck house 
golden an vandeleur have go off ter circumnavigate the island 
why do -PRON- take the three boat 
bl if i know 
a art to four -PRON- have take the three boat and go after cargo 
there could be no other explanation aboard be -PRON- next question 
an anchorwatch consistin -PRON- an the doctor an petie 
when do the boat leave 
nigh onto three hour ago i guess be snoozin full an by most ever since an havenot keep much track o the time believe come aboard and have a chat with -PRON- mr stubb i volunteer ye come

what be -PRON- order mr stubbs 
to keep the schoon a cable length away from ye 
i like ye fust chop -PRON- mr lorry but there s be rum doin on this hooker ever since ye swat the skipper over the head 
-PRON- suit -PRON- uncommon ter pull out to ye if i have a boat or ter let ye come aboard purvidin order aginst -PRON- 
a a ter to four believe -PRON- mr stubb i call gratefully 
what be the skipper intend to do get -PRON- over -PRON- head now 
well -PRON- s no well than a pirate and have the law on -PRON- one of these day between -PRON- an -PRON- an i donot want ter take side 
i guess -PRON- understand how fix 
i do understand 
at that moment the head of eph and petie appear over the rail forward 
whatever the mate say and do would be re peate to captain golden so -PRON- have to bridle -PRON- tongue and act judiciously 
if -PRON- could have pose openly as -PRON- friend without incur the captain displeasure i feel that stubb would have do so 
even now i be positive that -PRON- be secretly friendly toward -PRON- 
while i stand there consider what should be -PRON- next move a dip of oar and a hoarse mumble of voice echo from the coveinlet 
presently three boat push out of the deepen e shadow in the passage 
ahoy the schooner roar the voice of cap tain golden 
eph and petie turn away from the rail to a a ter to four face in the direction of the approach boat 
as stubb answer the hail -PRON- motion with -PRON- hand for -PRON- to retire 
-PRON- get some salvage from the wreck o the gagelle go on the skipper an well hoist -PRON- aboard by the davittackle 
stand by mr stubb to lend a hand 
there be exultation in captain tone 
-PRON- manner of refer to the plunder as salvage be decidedly humorous 
ten box pipe vandeleur jubilantly from another of the boat 
those box be steal i shout -PRON- be long to three of -PRON- who be still ashore and to vandeleur 
i hear captain startled oath as -PRON- come rip across the water 
-PRON- be round to under the stern of the schoon 
then i hear -PRON- call of way enough and see -PRON- rise in the sternsheet and face the beach there be -PRON- -PRON- fling at -PRON- with a torrent of profanity think -PRON- have hove to alongside the bottom 
-PRON- tricky work with vandeleur didnot pan out do -PRON- be i a a to cause -PRON- have a decent skipper along that stand for fair play 
avast with that 
i shout angrily 
cap tain golden -PRON- be a piratical scoundrel make off with property that doesnot be long to -PRON- and live to have -PRON- up for rob bery on the high sea a rifle crack sharply 
golden have stoop pick the weapon up and fire from -PRON- hip be fore i could get an inkling of what -PRON- be about 
screen by the grow dusk i be not an easy target and the skipper haste to get in the shot have mar -PRON- aim 
the bullet sing harm lessly through the air 
lift the butt of the gun to -PRON- shoulder -PRON- sight carefully for another shot 
just as -PRON- pull trigger i see the stern of the boat veer swiftly to starboard 
the second bullet also go wild 
golden face the bow with savage fury 
that be -PRON- -PRON- damned swede -PRON- yell 
-PRON- lean forward and i hear the impact of a blow a notion to make o ye but look to yerself when i git ye aboard 
i believe that i understand what have hap a a to four pened 
one of the swede have pull -PRON- oar at the right moment thus disconcert the skip per aim 
i be grateful to the sailor but -PRON- be a rash thing for -PRON- to do 
i should have fire with -PRON- revolver imme diately after the skipper first shoot but for the fear of injure some one else in the boat 
as i be powerless to prevent the skipper and vande leur from carry out -PRON- design and know e that further threat be bad than useless i turn and hurry toward the cleft 
at the top of the beach i meet zelda 
-PRON- have be hurry and be quite breathless 
what be that fire robert -PRON- de mande 
captain golden try a couple of shot at -PRON- zelda 
what will that scoundrel do next 
i hear the firing and -PRON- first thought be that -PRON- have forget -PRON- promise 
any promise i make -PRON- i consider sacred 
please donot put -PRON- like that 
do -PRON- learn anything about captain intention 
all that be necessary 
-PRON- intend to kill -PRON- a a to four if -PRON- can and think -PRON- have already accom plishe -PRON- at the cavern 
-PRON- be equal to anything breathe zelda 
when i reach the schooner i proceed the skipper vandeleur and most of the crew have go and take all the boat 
stubb be in charge and -PRON- say the skipper have leave order not to let -PRON- come aboard suppose so exclaimed zelda angrily 
cap tain golden will not let -PRON- step foot on the ship again glad of -PRON- robert 
after what have happen i shouldnot feel easy a minute if -PRON- be there 
nevertheless zelda -PRON- shall have to go aboard the schooner and take -PRON- chance 
-PRON- would be plain starvation for -PRON- to stay on this island -PRON- know better that than that -PRON- should be shoot or throw overboard -PRON- cry recklessly 
then -PRON- stamp -PRON- foot and stare toward the schooner 
oh i wish i wish i be a man 
then i could help -PRON- as -PRON- ought to be help 
-PRON- have already help -PRON- more than any man could have do and what be -PRON- do down there 
-PRON- a a to four point toward the shadowy boat near the schooner stern 
-PRON- be hoist aboard the teakwood case i answer 
-PRON- receive the announcement calmly 
well let -PRON- let -PRON- have -PRON- teakwood case and sail away with -PRON- 
after all -PRON- be a small price to pay for -PRON- safety 
i be satis fie robert 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- and stretch out -PRON- hand 
let -PRON- go back to the hut -PRON- add smilingly 
-PRON- have a surprise for -PRON- there be not satisfied little girl i return ear nestly take -PRON- hand and before -PRON- return to the hut i want to tell -PRON- of a plan 
-PRON- isnot good to excite mrs brackett by talk the mat ter over before -PRON- 
what be the plan 
zelda ask suspiciously 
unless something be do -PRON- shall be leave on the island i continue be use to hard ship but that would not do for -PRON- and mrs brackett 
no -PRON- flash 
well then sir what do -PRON- want to do with mrs brackett and -PRON- 
-PRON- must all leave fortune island on the a arter to four schooner i insist 
that be good for lady and for -PRON- too -PRON- when -PRON- be on the schooner -PRON- be in the same ship with the trea ure and there be always the chance that some thing will turn matter -PRON- way 
well -PRON- ask impatiently 
if i can get aboard the schoon tonight and have a quiet talk with the mate i be sure -PRON- can reach some sort of an understanding 
what good will an understanding with the mate do -PRON- robert 
mr stubb will obey cap tain golden 
besides how would -PRON- get aboard 
swim shouldnot think after what -PRON- go through today -PRON- would ever want to get into salt water again 
there probably isnot a single shark in the whole lagoon 
-PRON- donot want to go aboard the schooner merely totalk with mr stubb assert zelda after a short period of reflection 
what be -PRON- real reason robert 
well i admit charily if i could make a a a to four prisoner of the skipper and bring -PRON- ashore -PRON- would have everything in -PRON- own hand 
-PRON- turn squarely about and stare at -PRON- 
-PRON- be mad to think of -PRON- 
the very idea of -PRON- swimming out to the schoon climb aboard then make a prisoner of captain gold en and bring -PRON- ashorewith every one on board against -PRON- 
-PRON- shall not attempt any such foolhardy plan as that -PRON- add deci sively 
but -PRON- must do something i protest 
will -PRON- take -PRON- advice robert -PRON- ask 
-PRON- be a girl of good judgment zelda and i should be glad of -PRON- counsel 
then do nothing tonight 
give captain golden until tomorrow morning to think this matter over 
-PRON- be do wronghe be do something that will make -PRON- amenable to the law 
-PRON- know all this and sober second thought will lead -PRON- to see -PRON- error 
in the morning -PRON- will all three go down to the beach and have a talk with -PRON- 
but where will -PRON- and mrs brackett stay tonight 
i ask in dismay 
-PRON- laugh 
a a to four why in the hut -PRON- goose -PRON- answer 
-PRON- be quite comfortable 
i shall be far more contented there than i would be aboard the schooner 
and there be the matter of food i go on remember what a terrific inroad i have make on the content of the hamper at noon 
-PRON- and mrs brackett must not go hungry 
-PRON- do not intend to go hungry robert nor to let -PRON- go hungry either 
i tell -PRON- -PRON- have a surprise at the hut 
will -PRON- promise to put aside that crazy plan of -PRON- and let further action lie over until tomorrow morning 
of course i answer but against -PRON- well judgment if -PRON- want -PRON- that way do want -PRON- that way -PRON- return with finality and so -PRON- will consider the matter set tle 
now for the surprise 
the surprise consist of a hot supper 
zelda and mrs brackett have find match break up piece of the wreckage for firewood and have build a fire in the stove 
somewhere about the hut -PRON- have find cof fee sugar and condense milk 
a tin of can meat and another of tomato have be open a a to four and there be enough bread leave in the hamper to supply the evening meal 
consider -PRON- sad discovery of the day -PRON- be far from be a jolly party but after so many week on shipboard i be sure -PRON- all en joy the land 
mrs brackett be pensive but i could see that -PRON- be slowly recover from the bitter blow of the morning 
-PRON- candle be all in the cavern so -PRON- have nothing with which to make a light 
evening be well advanced before -PRON- finish -PRON- sup per and -PRON- be something of a feat to find -PRON- own dish and keep from help -PRON- out of -PRON- neighbor 
mrs brackett and zelda make -PRON- as comfortable as -PRON- could in the hut and i take some blanket and go out of door to pass the night 
truth to tell i fear a visit from cap tain golden and -PRON- man for i choose to think that instead of pass a night in repentance -PRON- would be concoct fresh deviltry 
so i take both revolver and lay -PRON- down at a point where i should be arouse by intruder before -PRON- have a chance to reach the hut 
noth ing untoward happen to -PRON- however and i a a to four sleep soundly and awake in excellent spirit and mightily refresh 
-PRON- breakfast off the remain of -PRON- supper and then the three of -PRON- set off toward the cove for -PRON- intend colloquy with the supposedly repentant captain golden 
as -PRON- advance along the valley toward the top of the beach -PRON- fail to descry the tall mast of the lady may and when -PRON- reach the beach -PRON- stare eye sweep the lagoon only to return and rest upon each other in blank dismay 
the schooner have flee from the island some time during the night 
maroon 
i gasp 
dear dear murmured mrs brackett toss e -PRON- hand that 
i explain and the poor lady fall to sob and bewail 
as usual zelda make -PRON- -PRON- duty to soothe and console -PRON- and i imagine that zelda be not so grievously cast down by -PRON- misfortune as -PRON- may have be 
only the mate 
zelda and i have be keep as many of the serious detail of -PRON- situation from mrs brack ett as -PRON- could 
the good woman be naturally pessimistic and -PRON- aim to show -PRON- the bright side of the picture 
now in order to reconcile -PRON- with -PRON- lot -PRON- tell of captain treachery in the mat ter of the teakwood case and how -PRON- have lead to the further treachery of -PRON- marooning 
zelda show -PRON- how much safe and better off -PRON- be on the island than -PRON- could possibly have be on the schooner and so well do -PRON- talk that mrs brackett come almost to regard that barren isle as a haven of refuge and -PRON- ma roone a providence 
i hold the private opinion that zelda have feel all along that something of this sort would hap penindeed that -PRON- desire -PRON- to happenand that -PRON- be throw -PRON- full heart into the per suasion of mrs brackett 
a a ter to four -PRON- elderly companion seem to have but one regret the mortgage on -PRON- emmetsburg home may be foreclose before a ship take -PRON- off and carry -PRON- away to frisco in time to pay the in ter 
while the two lady be talk i climb the arroyobank and gaze to seaward in all di rection 
there be no sign of the lady may so -PRON- must have hove up the anchor and get clear of the island very soon after -PRON- teakwood case have be put aboard 
well -PRON- be console to know that i have save the well part of -PRON- patrimony even though the treasure have be lose 
i should have about four thousand dollar with which to make a beginning when -PRON- regain -PRON- own coun try 
from the blank sea i bring -PRON- gaze to the valley and look at the lithe graceful form of zelda as -PRON- move about mrs brackett like a minister angel 
after all what do i care for the treasure 
-PRON- be the treasure that have bring zelda and -PRON- together 
now that -PRON- have accomplish -PRON- a a to four purpose -PRON- may take wing and welcome 
i feel in -PRON- heart that a rich prize be to be mine 
-PRON- may talk -PRON- situation over i observe descend the hill and rejoin -PRON- compan ion 
-PRON- chance of be take off this island at an early day be not flatter 
what of that robert demand zelda 
-PRON- be a novel experience and i be sure -PRON- will en joy -PRON- 
besides -PRON- be sure to be take off some time -PRON- know the homely question of food i sug geste simple enough yet all important 
find some coconut brighten mrs brack ett 
there isnot a coconuttree on the island mrs brackett i answer gravely 
just as well sighed mrs brackett fold -PRON- hand with quiet determination to endure any thing donot think i should be overly fond of coconut for a steady diet 
i imagine -PRON- wouldnot be healthful 
but i think ship go every which way across the ocean mr lorry 
-PRON- have certain track -PRON- follow between different point i explain little farther to the west would put -PRON- in the way of boat ply a a to four ing between san francisco and the samoa island and if -PRON- be farther east -PRON- would be in the way of traffic between san francisco and new zealand ner of the pacific 
but this be an obscure cor the fact that fortune island be not on the chart be proof that -PRON- be seldom vis ited 
but well surely be rescue after a while wonot -PRON- 
mrs brackett inquire 
oh of course i reply indefinitely will plant a flagstaff at each end of the island so that whenever a ship pass those aboard will know there be people here who be anxious to be take off be pretty sure say mrs brackett that mr cartwright will take care of -PRON- interest for -PRON- when -PRON- come due know where i be an -PRON- s be a real good friend to -PRON- since death save enough out of that two hundred dollar mr cartwright give -PRON- to pay the interest wouldnot worry about that mrs brackett i advise leave a curstanthem in the parlorwindow at home -PRON- sigh regretfully donot know a a to how i ever come to forget -PRON- when i take all -PRON- other plant over to mrs henry i know as much as anythin in the world that be away so long that curstanthemll just dry up like a bone wouldnot fret about anything mrs brack ett i go on but try y 
goodness -PRON- burst out clean forgot about -PRON- carpetbag 
that ornery captain gold en have sail away with that too 
-PRON- never rain but -PRON- pour do -PRON- deary 
and -PRON- look pathetically into face 
i give over try to be of any comfort to mrs brackett and go down toward the beach 
there i make a find 
a number of object lie in a promiscuous heap a suitcase of the recently lament carpetbag of mrs and -PRON- own bat tere satchel 
over under and around these be half a dozen side of bacon two ham a cheese a couple of bag of bread tin of coffee tea and condense milk and three pair of neatly roll blanket 
surmount the pile be a large piece of brown paper weight with a stone 
i take the a a to four paper from the pile and read the follow writ ten in a cramped and almost illegible hand mr lorry didun hav no han in -PRON- an swoar wold not leeve ilan without this truck be putt ashoar for -PRON- dam sory but be only the mate respeckfuly stubb 
that be stubb for -PRON- 
wave the paper above -PRON- head i call to the lady and -PRON- at once hurry down to the beach 
-PRON- have one friend aboard the lady may at all event say see what mr stubb put ashore for -PRON- always think mr stubb be too good a man to sail with captain golden declare zel da -PRON- eye glow at sight of -PRON- suitcase 
mrs brackett pounce upon the carpetbag and -PRON- go through the heterogeneous heap parcel by parcel 
-PRON- begin to look as though the food que tion be irrevocably settle say zelda 
mr stubb have do a great deal for -PRON- i go on but -PRON- will do even more 
unless i misread -PRON- -PRON- will have some ship head for fortune island to take -PRON- off before very long 
here be a note -PRON- leave with the good 
a a to four zelda take the note and study -PRON- for a few there be a heart of gold back of that -PRON- comment 
-PRON- return to the hut carry as much of the plunder as -PRON- could 
after that i make half a dozen trip and soon have -PRON- all at headquarters 
inasmuch as -PRON- money pay for this i re mark laughingly as i put down the last load think -PRON- be fairly entitled to -PRON- 
the glint come into hazel eye as -PRON- always do when -PRON- be deeply stir 
-PRON- be minus a good deal of money rob ert say -PRON- through captain dis honesty and treacherous conduct 
the only pos sible way -PRON- could have be repay be out of the content of those steal box 
really -PRON- know and the eyeflash be follow by a wan little smile still have the feeling that those box will yet come to -PRON- 
i shake -PRON- head 
the box perhaps i qualify but not what be in -PRON- 
captain golden be too old a hand to let any treasure slip through -PRON- finger 
at luncheon that day mrs brackett be a a to four greatly depressed 
now and again some stirring event would lure -PRON- mind from those mound and melancholy headboard only to let -PRON- swing back once more and plunge -PRON- into deep sad ness 
and in a measure -PRON- be so with zelda 
but zelda be young and of firm fiber 
realize the necessity of bear up under -PRON- misfortune so that -PRON- may be of help to -PRON- and a source of consolation to mrs brackett -PRON- thrust -PRON- own grief resolutely aside 
-PRON- enforce stay on the island be -PRON- long or short would pass most quickly and comfortably if -PRON- could contrive to keep -PRON- busy 
i have already plan a few task but -PRON- chief concern be to lay out enough work so that none of -PRON- should be force into idleness 
grief i un derstood very well take firm hold of those mind which have nothing to do but dwell on -PRON- sorrow 
the first piece of work i have set for -PRON- i feel sure would not be regard with favor by zelda so -PRON- be with some misgiving that i push back from the table and prepare to broach the subject to -PRON- companion 
back to the zelda say there be one point in recent affair which -PRON- must not overlook 
-PRON- turn -PRON- wide hazel eye upon -PRON- with a questioning lift of the brow 
what point be that robert -PRON- ask 
perhaps i go on all the teakwood box be not remove from the cave 
golden and vandeleur must have have to work hurriedly and -PRON- may be that -PRON- miss some of -PRON- 
i be angle for an excuse to pay the cavern another visit and in -PRON- own mind i have small doubt that golden and vandeleur have make a clean sweep of all the box 
indeed i have hear vandeleur call out something to the effect that -PRON- have ten box with -PRON- in the boat short ly after -PRON- colloquy with stubb from the beach 
however i think -PRON- well to make sure and be bend -PRON- energy toward secure zel das consent to -PRON- plan 
no robert and zelda shake -PRON- head de a arter to four cidedly -PRON- both know what sort of man cap tain golden be and -PRON- know -PRON- would not leave that cave until -PRON- have secure every box 
at any rate say believe i will go down there again and see for -PRON- 
a shudder run through the girl and a look of horror cross -PRON- face 
-PRON- wouldnot think of such a thing -PRON- cry 
there be no danger i return reassur ingly now that -PRON- enemy have leave the island 
but the shark 
-PRON- be more to be fear than human enemy robert not one chance in a hundred zelda that there will be any shark around the cave during the short time i shall be there 
but if one should come say -PRON- -PRON- voice tense and -PRON- face full of forebode if anything should happen to -PRON- what would be come of -PRON- 
-PRON- must take no unnecessary risk would not do that i answer gravely and if i think i be take any long chance i would not mention the matter 
but i do not a a to four give the cavern a very thorough examination when i be there as the finding of the box take up most of -PRON- attention 
now i be go back again and go over the place more carefully 
mrs brackett lift -PRON- griefstricken face 
-PRON- may find something there that tom have leave mr lorry say -PRON- 
if tom and brother and -PRON- cousin and this trent have anything to do with put those box in the cave like as not -PRON- may have leave something else there toosomethe -PRON- may be well for -PRON- to find 
mrs brackett be prove an unexpected ally 
i could see that zelda be waver and that mrs brackett have mention something which have not before occur to -PRON- 
nevertheless -PRON- have an objection 
depend on -PRON- say -PRON- that whatever be leave in the cave be find and carry away by captain golden and vandeleur leave some match and candle there i go on and i donot believe that golden and -PRON- land ingparty could find -PRON- 
-PRON- could use -PRON- very handily now i reply with a smile 
then i get up and take down the coil of rope a a ter to ur which have serve -PRON- so well on the occasion of -PRON- first visit to the cave 
-PRON- and mrs brackett may come with -PRON- zelda i add and watch for shark from the top of the cliff while i be below 
of course -PRON- shall go with -PRON- declare zelda and -PRON- leave the hut forthwith 
when -PRON- pass the headboard in make -PRON- way along the valley mrs grief open afresh 
zelda slip an arm around -PRON- and speak such word of comfort as -PRON- own grieving mind could suggest 
as soon as -PRON- reach the turn of the valley and have begin climb the bank i be pleased to see that the prospect of -PRON- adventure be claim more and more of mrs attention 
as -PRON- cross the flat crest of the hill and draw close to the brink of the cliff mrs brackett pause fear fully 
mercy -PRON- gasp 
be the cave down there -PRON- ever get to -PRON- mr lorry 
and how be those box ever take down there in the first place 
cling to zelda -PRON- edge cautiously toward a arter to four the brink and stand look down at the lashing get down easily enough i answer throw off -PRON- coat and drop down to take off -PRON- shoe 
when the box go into the cave mrs brackett -PRON- be take in by mean of a boat 
if -PRON- have a boat at hand now -PRON- could all visit the cave and do -PRON- safely and easily 
the way i be go be safe enoughonly a light tle more difficult that s all 
be -PRON- look for shark fin zelda 
i finish laughingly 
-PRON- be stand close to the edge of the cliff and -PRON- eye be wander sharply over the smooth water to seaward 
yes -PRON- answer shift -PRON- gaze to -PRON- and i be easy a minute until -PRON- be with -PRON- again robert 
the look in -PRON- eye disturb -PRON- 
-PRON- be pleasant to know that -PRON- welfare mean so much to -PRON- but -PRON- seem brutal to play with -PRON- fear by go on 
i feel that -PRON- be due to all of -PRON- however that a second and final examination should be make of the cave 
-PRON- must know be yond all peradventure that all the box have be remove by golden and vandeleur 
a a to ur i be not long in knot a noose in the end of the rope and in throw -PRON- over the boulder with -PRON- folded coat as a cushion then i drop the free end of the rope to the shelf 
at that point i discover that this rope be short than the one i have use before but a mental calcu lation convince -PRON- that -PRON- would reach far enough inside the cave to answer -PRON- purpose 
both revolver i leave with zelda be certain -PRON- will not see any shark zelda say but if -PRON- do shoot at -PRON- 
that will give -PRON- warning 
-PRON- voice wouldnot reach -PRON- in the cave but i could hear a revolvershot 
-PRON- wonot be long 
zelda ask with an -PRON- be plore note in -PRON- voice as i seat -PRON- on the brink preparatory to descend 
not a moment longer than necessary i re ply 
meanwhile please donot worry 
with that i grip the rope and start down 
when i reach the shelf i look up and see two white face peer down at -PRON- 
that be easy enough i cry wave -PRON- hand and the rest will be just as easy 
remove -PRON- shirt and stocking i leave -PRON- a a ter to four on the shelf then tie the rope to -PRON- belt i plunge into the churn surf and race through the cavern entrance 
have go over the course once i take -PRON- bearing and proceed to make a landing with out any preliminary investigation 
as on the other time i be halt in a smother of foam when i take up the slack in the rope but i at once begin swim to the right and quickly find bottom 
untie the rope from -PRON- belt i weight -PRON- with a stone as i have do before then after a moment rest i fall to hunt for the niche where i have leave the candle and match 
luck be with -PRON- and before many minute have pass i be move up and down the subter ranean strand look for whatever i may find 
i discover many footprint in the damp sand and come upon the spot where the boat have nose into the beach but as for teakwood box there be not one to be see 
i be not sur prise on the contrary i should have be sur prise if i have find that even one have be leave 
have thus settle the matter of the treasure to -PRON- complete satisfaction i begin a thorough a a to four investigation of the cave 
i go at this sys tematically zigzag back and forth between the wall and the water edge and cover every foot of ground 
the sum of -PRON- discovery be a claspknife 
-PRON- be bright and new which be proof positive that -PRON- have not lie for any length of time in the damp air of the cave 
quite likely -PRON- have be drop by one of the landingparty from the lady may with a sense of keen disappointment because of -PRON- failure to discover anything worth while i make -PRON- way to the spot where i have see the box 
there by merest chance a flash of can dlelight on the wall reveal something that draw -PRON- instant attention 
a flat surface of the wall have be scratch deeply with some hard pointed instrument 
-PRON- surprise be great when i find that the indentation take the form of letter and that the letter group -PRON- into word 
not a little excited i push the candle closer to the wall 
the printing be in two line roughly do but all perfectly legible capt eugene trent brigantine gazelle arthur mayhew 9th a a to four that be all but brief and unsatisfactory though -PRON- be the word come like a message from the tomb 
trent and mayhew 
be -PRON- the one who have bring the teakwood box to the cavern 
if so why have -PRON- not chisel in the rock some thing about anstruther and brackett 
think i may discover something by search the wall further i begin examine the stone carefully and work -PRON- way foot by foot around the cavern 
perhaps i have be at this work for a quarter of an hour when i hear a sound that force -PRON- from the wall with a frantic leap 
the candle shake in -PRON- hand and i stagger unsteadily hope against hope that -PRON- ear have play -PRON- a trick 
but i be not mistaken 
once more the sound float in through the cavern entrance muffled but distinct 
-PRON- be the report of a revolver 
escape from the cave 
in -PRON- time i have hear -PRON- say of some man that -PRON- do not know what fear be 
per sonally i doubt if such a man ever live 
there would be no merit in courage if there be no such thing as fear 
but a test for any man would be to place -PRON- as i be place then immure in a cave whose only exit be by an arm of the seablockade by a maneate shark 
-PRON- life as a soldier of fortune have bring -PRON- face to face with many peril but never have danger play such havoc with -PRON- nerve as -PRON- do then 
and the fact that i have go into -PRON- recklessly and openeye in no wise minister to -PRON- peace of mind 
zelda have counsel -PRON- against take the risk and i have laugh at -PRON- fear 
drop nervelessly on the wet sand i peer with wild eye toward the entrance of the cave and upbraid -PRON- for be a headstrong fool 
there have be nothing to gain by the ven a a to four ture and everything to lose in case luck happen to go against -PRON- 
even if i have find a box of treasure how would -PRON- have help -PRON- in -PRON- sorry situation 
now when i find -PRON- trap i could conjure up a thousand and one reason why i should never have pay that second visit to the but if i have one think for -PRON- i have two for zelda and mrs brackett 
i picture -PRON- crouch on the brink of the cliff staring with terrorstricken eye at the triangular fin dart e through the water 
unable to aid -PRON- what must have be -PRON- hopelessness and despair 
this thought bring back -PRON- courage 
i have the claspknife 
with that in -PRON- belt and with the rope to aid -PRON- i would swim and fight -PRON- way back to the shelf 
before i set out on -PRON- return i watch the sunlit stretch of water that lead into the cave 
nothing strike athwart the channel to arouse -PRON- fear 
if i work quickly and make the good use of the rope there be a chance that i could gain the shelf unmolested 
pass hurriedly around the beach to the place where i have leave the end of the rope i plant a arter to four what remain of -PRON- candle in the sand wrap the rest of the candle and the match in -PRON- waterproof covering tie the packet to -PRON- belt and then plunge resolutely into the water 
the current buffet -PRON- roughly but the pull of the rope and the resistance -PRON- body offer to the current serve to buoy -PRON- up 
i have little swim to do and -PRON- way along the lifeline 
from time to time i lift -PRON- head and shoulder above the wave shake the water from -PRON- eye and stare about -PRON- 
the thing i dread i fail to see and presently i be back on the shelf overcome with a sense of relief almost as much as i be by the fatigue of -PRON- fierce struggle with the current 
robert a voice call down to -PRON- 
rise to -PRON- knee i look upward 
zelda and mrs brackett be stare over the cliff edge the shark zelda 
i cry 
-PRON- be a mistake robert -PRON- answer be sorry if -PRON- alarm -PRON- but -PRON- nerve be none too steady 
look 
-PRON- point as -PRON- speak 
follow -PRON- fin ger with -PRON- eye i see a bit of wreckage twist a arter to four and whirl in the wave 
i could afford to laugh now 
be that what -PRON- see 
i ask get into -PRON- shirt 
and -PRON- think -PRON- be a shark 
i make a mental reservation then and there that neither of -PRON- companion should ever know what a bad halfhour -PRON- have give -PRON- in the cave 
after a brief rest i start up the face of the fiftyfoot cliff finally get over the top with the aid of zelda and mrs brackett the last time i pant as i lie sprawl out in the sun that i shall ever visit the cave 
do -PRON- discover anything robert that make the risk worth while ask zelda find this i answer take the knife from -PRON- belt 
mrs brackett give the blade a quick look then turn away -PRON- eye disappointedly box be all go mr lorry -PRON- ask 
golden and vandeleur make a clean sweep 
i see where -PRON- boat have ground on the beach and where -PRON- have tramp back and forth load a a to four e the box but this knife be all -PRON- have leave behind 
but -PRON- get the candle and match say zelda quietly watch as i untie the packet from -PRON- belt 
all the candle and match in the world robert wouldnot pay for what what -PRON- go through up here on the cliff while wait for -PRON- to come 
i be properly rebuke and hope in -PRON- soul that never again should i see such a look of re proach as be then in hazel eye 
well say -PRON- know exactly where -PRON- stand now 
if i hadnot investigate the cave -PRON- may always have have the feeling that some of the treasure have be leave there 
now -PRON- know that all of -PRON- be take from the island in the lady may 
on the wall i bite the word off short wonder how -PRON- companion would take -PRON- when i tell -PRON- that trent and mayhew have leave sign of -PRON- pre ence in the cave while brother and mrs son have not 
on the wall flutter mrs brackett -PRON- face light with sudden hope 
do -PRON- find something on the wall of that cave mr lorry 
a a to four -PRON- be nothing of any importance mrs brackett say i gently just the name of cap tain trent and -PRON- cousin arthur scratch on the stone 
after name follow the two word brigantine gazelle and after 9th regiment why mrs brackett murmur that be regiment 
and add zelda 
then say -PRON- cousin -PRON- brother zel da and mrs son all belong to the same regimentperhap to the same company 
this show how the three may have be throw together but -PRON- doesnot help -PRON- much otherwise 
where do captain trent and the gazelle come in 
mrs brackett shake -PRON- head in pathetic be wilderment 
zelda give a deep sigh 
some time say zelda all this may be make clear to -PRON- but -PRON- be very dark and mysterious now 
-PRON- relative be in the brigantine with captain trent and -PRON- have those teakwood box with -PRON- 
the brigantine be wreck and four of those on board get safely ashore and take the box to the cave 
that be all -PRON- really a a to four know 
let -PRON- not plague -PRON- with surmise but accept the situation as -PRON- find itand go back to the hut 
-PRON- can do nothing more rob ert but wait and hope for the good 
i put on -PRON- shoe and coat coil up the rope and swing -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder then -PRON- retrace -PRON- way across the crest of the hill through the valley and back to the rude little shanty which have now become -PRON- home 
in the end i think -PRON- be all well for that afternoon experience 
-PRON- bring home to -PRON- as nothing else could have do -PRON- mutual need of each other in -PRON- forlorn situation and teach -PRON- to grieve less over what -PRON- have lose and to do more toward cultivate an optimistic spirit for the general good 
mrs brackett sigh as -PRON- pass the row of headboard in the valley but there be resigna tion in -PRON- face and a calm determination to make the good of -PRON- lot 
island day 
the pall of misfortune rest upon -PRON- but lightly 
the shadow cast by that gloomy row of carved board beyond the spring do not often reach the place which -PRON- call home 
never in -PRON- wildest dream do i think i could be so happy and content as i be during those day -PRON- spend on that barren little island 
-PRON- be the most satisfying kind of happiness too for -PRON- have -PRON- undernote of resignation which hal low -PRON- and give -PRON- the ring of true worth 
the tradewind blow almost constantly from the northeast temper the heat of the shadeless valley 
so far from induce languor the air be like wine and inspire to effort 
zelda work by -PRON- side in the several out door task -PRON- set for -PRON- help to plan as well as to execute 
mrs brackett assume charge of the house and the culinary operation 
from the wreckage near the hut zelda and i dig out one of the brigantine upper yard 
a art to four this i hack in two at the middle with the ma chete and -PRON- carry one half to the eastern end of the island and the other half to the western end 
-PRON- set -PRON- up on the high elevation plant -PRON- firmly in a nest of stone 
then -PRON- make two streamer out of a white blanket which -PRON- have find in the hut use needle and coarse thread donate by mrs brackett out of the content of -PRON- carpetbag 
these stream ers -PRON- fly from the top of -PRON- flagpole ho ping -PRON- would attract the notice of any wander e ship that chance to pass in -PRON- vicinity 
while -PRON- still have faith that stubb would send a vessel to pick -PRON- up yet -PRON- feel that -PRON- should do everything possible to hasten -PRON- rescue 
when the pole be set and the streamer in place zelda and i have other work come to -PRON- hand in the sand opposite the point where the gazelle have meet -PRON- fate -PRON- discov ere a whaleboat 
the boat have be badly stove in aft but -PRON- be sound forward as zelda and i find when -PRON- have dig -PRON- out of the beach 
repair -PRON- robert say zelda 
what for 
i query mentally weigh the task and -PRON- mean for accomplish -PRON- 
a a to four so -PRON- can take -PRON- to see the cavern and so -PRON- can pay a visit to the gazelle 
i have long want to visit the wreck of the brigantine -PRON- just to see if anything could be find that would throw light upon the situa tion -PRON- have encounter on the island suggestion be a good one and -PRON- start to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- work on the beach transport -PRON- slen der supply of material from the hut 
the re pair on the whaleboat be never finish for the reason that -PRON- be interrupt in -PRON- long task by a rescue but i look back on that era of planning and work as one of the most delight ful period of -PRON- life 
-PRON- have the machete and -PRON- have a butcher knife 
of the latter -PRON- make a saw serrate -PRON- straight edge with piece of flint 
one entire day be consume in the manufac ture of the saw and i remember the joy with which zelda see -PRON- haggle -PRON- through a piece of board 
i be half an hour get through six inch of pine and -PRON- applaud heartily when i straighten erect with the two piece of board in -PRON- hand 
a a ter to four -PRON- prospective operation be all detailed in advance 
-PRON- be to get nail from the wreck age unlay rope to get material for calking and -PRON- be to try to make a cement from powdered shell as a substitute for pitch 
the first step be to saw the whaleboat in two just forward of the wreck stern 
this -PRON- ac complishe in three day 
an oak sternpost be work out with the machete and a knife make fast to the shortened keel of the whaleboat and strengthen with a sternpostknee 
then -PRON- begin cut out the lumber to fill in the gap at the square stern 
while i gouge away with the butcherknife see and pound with a stone hammer zelda sit on the beach beside -PRON- unlaye rope for calk 
where do -PRON- suppose those ten teakwood box come from robert -PRON- once ask -PRON- 
-PRON- talk a great deal while -PRON- work and -PRON- illfated expedition be a neverfaile topic get -PRON- guess as the man say and i give -PRON- a quizzical glance from the clew of one eye somehow suggest china to -PRON- i add a moment later 
a arter to four have -PRON- ever try to guess how those teak wood case come to be in the gazelle 
no zelda 
i have never even try to guess how thomas brackett -PRON- cousin arthur or -PRON- brother archie come to be in the gazelle 
-PRON- be soldier and supposedly off some where in the philippine or in china 
what be -PRON- do on captain brigantine with ten teakwood case a condition of affair that defy analysis 
some one of the four send -PRON- those card with instruction to meet at the palace hotel on april twentyfifth 
presumably that be -PRON- cousin arthur 
-PRON- must have be 
presumably also -PRON- be take off this island for -PRON- could never have send the card from here 
why do -PRON- deal through lawyer instead of send the card directly to -PRON- 
in -PRON- case zelda -PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to deal directly with -PRON- as -PRON- do not know -PRON- address 
i have be a rolling stone -PRON- know and roll stone be proverbially hard to find 
-PRON- cousin i think deal with only one law a arter to four yer robert and that be mr price 
if so -PRON- cousin must have be in san francisco 
if arthur be in san francisco say i in credulously why do -PRON- not come to see -PRON- 
why do -PRON- not help -PRON- with advice give ex planation or even join the expedition 
-PRON- may have be unable to do so or perhaps -PRON- have some good reason for hang back 
i shake -PRON- head hopelessly bootless to do any surmising now zelda treasure have vanish and the mystery will probably remain unsolved 
the treasure will return and the mystery will be solve -PRON- assert with quiet convic tion 
day after day -PRON- labor on 
-PRON- come to be completely wrap up in the rejuvenation of that whaleboat rush to the hut for -PRON- meal and then rush off again with hardly half a dozen word for mrs brackett 
two week slip away 
most unexpectedly the lapse of the fortnight bring -PRON- to the end of -PRON- island probation 
-PRON- be afternoon and i be just finish off a a to four the stern of the whaleboat preparatory to calk ing 
very quietly zelda announce a ship robert 
i turn quickly around 
the girl be look seaward shade -PRON- eye with -PRON- hand 
there be no trace in -PRON- of the joy a cast away would be expect to feel in the circum stance 
-PRON- have say a ship robert just as -PRON- may have remark here come aunt sarah to call -PRON- to supper 
the ship be a foreandafter and be stand e in quite close schooner say -PRON- arenot in much of a transport zelda -PRON- glad be go to be take off suppose i be -PRON- answer dubiously with a regretful look at -PRON- unfinished work but i wish the rescue could have be delay until -PRON- have get the whaleboat into the water 
throw down the stone hammer i step to -PRON- side 
-PRON- have be happy here i ask in spite of the fact that -PRON- be maroon and that -PRON- have lose the treasure 
happy yes -PRON- murmur happy than i ever think i could be 
a arter to four have be happy too i say take -PRON- hand 
even a barren rock in the pacific be come a paradise when there be work to be do and love to robert -PRON- cry out show some excite ment at last 
that ship be the lady may i have not be watch the schooner but try e to catch the hazel eye which be evade mine and gaze seaward word star tle -PRON- and i turn and stare across the sunlit zelda be right 
the schooner be none other than -PRON- old friend the lady may 
the main question be this why be -PRON- re turn 
do the fact bode well or ill for the three on the island 
a new master 
zelda and i hasten to carry the news to mrs brackett 
there be not the least doubt as to that good ladys feeling for -PRON- be fairly be side -PRON- with joy 
with zelda and -PRON- i believe mrs brackett have achieve a certain amount of contentment there on the island 
but the root of -PRON- con tentment have not strike so deep that -PRON- feel constrain to regret the end of -PRON- probation 
together -PRON- proceed to the westernmost ele vation 
the schoon bear down on the island smartly from the northeast would cer tainly hunt for -PRON- old anchorage in the cove 
for two hour -PRON- watch -PRON- 
come around the end of the island -PRON- beat in through the leeward passage and splash -PRON- anchor into the lagoon 
lie directly under -PRON- what i see on -PRON- deck surprise -PRON- 
the skipper with the fiery hair be not in evi dence 
neither be vandeleur 
a arter to stubb be on the poop and -PRON- raucous voice roll up to -PRON- as -PRON- give -PRON- peremptory order 
i observe that -PRON- be armed with a rifle 
anderson also armed be forward among the crew 
larsen a revolver thrust through -PRON- belt stand aft alongside of stubb 
the hand forward move nimbly enough yet -PRON- be clear that armed authority alone hold -PRON- respect 
stubb look up at -PRON- and motion toward the beach 
when -PRON- gain the sand anderson be on -PRON- way to -PRON- in the dory 
the boat ground and -PRON- step ashore with a grim smile 
all well mr lorry -PRON- ask 
all well anderson i reply hap pen aboard the schooner prefer to let captain stubb tell -PRON- that sir 
-PRON- be to go aboard in the dory and i be to help the lady get -PRON- trap down to the beach 
i look at zelda questioningly 
-PRON- will help mr anderson robert say -PRON- 
besides -PRON- shall want to go over by the spring before -PRON- go aboard 
a arter to four -PRON- and mrs brackett want to pay a last visit to the grave and -PRON- want to be alone 
-PRON- can go there tomorrow zelda i ad vise 
beg -PRON- pardon sir put in anderson but captain stubb want to get away tonight 
-PRON- will understand why when -PRON- get on board the reason too -PRON- send -PRON- ashore in stead of come -PRON- 
i push off the dory and get in 
a few min ute lay -PRON- alongside the schooner stern and i climb to the deck 
glad to meet ye mr lorry grin stubb

think yed git along all right fer a while with the stuff i pile on the beach 
i shake -PRON- hand heartily 
-PRON- lean against the forward part of the cabin where -PRON- could keep watch of the man and keep the rifle in -PRON- hand 
larsen be forward lean against the starboard rail 
the two american the mex ican and the kanaka huddle sullenly against the port rail opposite be go on here mr stubbs

ever since -PRON- put about be on deck most o the time an the crack of a revolver interrupt stubb 
the sharp report be follow by a yell and the sound of a struggle 
the mexican and the kanaka have leap to one of the boat on the forward house 
larsen have order -PRON- back and allison and minturn have rush across the deck to disarm -PRON- 
larsen have time to shoot and minturn fall back curse and grip at -PRON- left wrist

-PRON- tumble in -PRON- track 
the mexican seeing stubb rifle train on -PRON- throw down -PRON- knife and toss -PRON- hand in the air 
i pick up the knife and the and throw -PRON- overboard 
by then stubb have race to the scene 
pluck e allison away from larsen with a steellike grip -PRON- fling -PRON- clear across the deck and against the port rail 
as the fellow jump up stubb hand -PRON- a fierce blow directly between the eye and down -PRON- go like an ox under the poleax 
the four be then drag and kick to the hatch and throw below 
stay there ye onnery whelp shout stubb till i tell ye ter come on deck

petie be look after the captain face be haggard -PRON- red hair strag gle about -PRON- brow and through the tangle the unshielded cavity of -PRON- defunct eye show hor ribly 
under the hair and hide the depression in the temple be a white bandage 
the skip per eye be closed and -PRON- seem asleep 
-PRON- manacle hand lie across -PRON- breast 
-PRON- foot be not secure 
a a to four have ankleiron on -PRON- fer a spell say stubb an keep -PRON- lash ter the bunk be side 
that be when -PRON- be vilent easy now 
petie stay right with -PRON- be all the time 
be there any one on board that know any thing about surgery or medicine 
i ask 
anderson do 
-PRON- examine the skipper arter -PRON- quiet down sost -PRON- could sheer along side without a fracas 
but -PRON- too much of a problem fer anderson 
anderson think the only thing -PRON- kin do be ter leave the skipper like -PRON- be till -PRON- git back -PRON- move on to the stateroom unlock the door and call to vandeleur 
-PRON- come out crawl over the box that fill the space be tween the low bunk and the bulkhead 
-PRON- be an exceedingly dishearten youth if appear ance count for anything the use of keep -PRON- lock up -PRON- whimper 
this isnot -PRON- do mr lorry 
golden be to blame admit i tell -PRON- moren i ought to but after that -PRON- take every thing in -PRON- own hand donot -PRON- know 
i a a ter to four havenot do right but willing to let bygone be bygone if -PRON- be 
-PRON- thrust out -PRON- hand toward -PRON- 
i turn away in disgust 
-PRON- wonot be necessary to keep -PRON- lock up there any longer mr stubb say -PRON- power for evil be go and there be man enough aboard now to look after the four in the and vandeleur too if -PRON- need -PRON- 
j as -PRON- say mr lorry return stubb but i never do hev any use fer that towheade lubber 
two hour later the schooner be hail from the shore and i row over in the dory and bring back zelda mrs brackett anderson and the little heap of good -PRON- have carry to the beach 
mrs brackett be cry softly and eye be red 
about nine oclock that evening -PRON- catch the wind in -PRON- topsail and work through the leeward channel into the open sea then -PRON- put about give the island a wide berth and lay course for home 
the only event worthy of record during that a arter to four homeward voyage happen on the first night out 
some blame be afterward attach to stubb and indirectly to the rest of -PRON- because of -PRON- yet stubb be asleep in -PRON- berth at the time and the rest of -PRON- on deck or below be as powerless to prevent the tragedy as though -PRON- have be a thousand mile away 
mrs brackett and zelda be in -PRON- state room 
i be stand the first watch with an derson help to keep an eye on allison and the kanaka who have be bring up from the fore castle for duty 
stubb as have be state be get a little need rest in the stateroom occu pie by vandeleur 
the kanaka have the wheel 
suddenly an earsplitte yell echo from be low deck aft 
an instant later i see a form bind through the companion jump to the rail and go over the side head first 
-PRON- all happen so quickly that no one could get close enough to interfere before the splash alongside tell that the man have strike the water 
man overboard come the yell 
anderson shoot -PRON- order rapidly at the ka naka and i leap to help allison with the sail 
the schooner come around and when i go aft a a to four i find that larsen have come up and be help e anderson clear away the dory 
-PRON- be captain golden say anderson 
larsen say -PRON- jump out of -PRON- bunk bowl petie over with a doublehanded blow of the steel cuff and rush for the deck 
larsen and i man the dory while anderson climb the main rig to watch and direct -PRON- 
frisco again 
-PRON- effort be useless 
manacle as the skipper be -PRON- must have go down like a piece of lead 
larsen and i cruise about for two hour and be then call back to the schooner by stubb 
no use wastin any more time say stubb the skipper get -PRON- whatfor though ruther -PRON- have come in any other way git -PRON- an anderson ter sign the log as witness mr lor ry when i write -PRON- up in the mornin 
the schooner be once more put on -PRON- course and -PRON- bear away leave the illfated skipper somewhere in the broad reach of water behind 
-PRON- be a depressing event 
captain golden have be no friend of mine and -PRON- have try at least twice to take -PRON- life yet the suddenness with which -PRON- have meet -PRON- end inspire a gruesome feeling which i do not get over for day 
zelda receive the news of the skipper death a a to four calmly and without comment 
mrs humanity bring from -PRON- a few word of re gret but nothing could mar the good woman complacency over the prospect of an early arrival home with a quarterly share of the treasure 
the effect of the tragedy on the four mutinous man forward be most marked 
-PRON- sullen ness vanish by degree 
-PRON- have come to realize that there be nothing in the ten box for -PRON- and i soothe -PRON- regret by an offer of double pay all around 
a few day after captain death i call a conference in the cabin a second confer ence of the four 
one of the teakwood box have be open by the skipper and vandeleur and a little mound of -PRON- content be heap on the cabin table 
the mound consist of metallic fragment roughly hack from some parent mass and show ax and pickmark 
there be little in a casual survey of the fragment to suggest value 
every piece be stain and discolor and in some of -PRON- be embed particle of broken stone 
a a to four be that all -PRON- get for -PRON- trouble mutter mrs brackett survey the heap dejectedly 
i take up one of the fragment and cut into -PRON- with a knife 
-PRON- cut easily and the passing of the knifeblade leave a glitter surface streak with yellow and gray 
unless i be greatly mistaken mrs brack ett i remark each of these fragment con sist of silver and gold in a marvelously pure state 
by some mean perhaps by the action of volcanic fire the metal have be melt and run together 
there be ten box of this rich con glomerate remember and each box weigh a hundred and fifty pound 
in other word -PRON- have some fifteen hundred pound of gold and silver in nearly a pure state 
as a mere guess i should say that each box contain treasure to the amount of thirty thousand dollar gasp mrs brackett simply a guess 
-PRON- donot know the proportion of silver to gold nor how much must be take from the weight for foreign matter -PRON- bed in the molten metal 
but i be of opin ion that the figure state be most conservative 
a a to four mrs brackett struggle for a while to com prehend the enormity of -PRON- good luck 
vande leur sit at one side of the table keep -PRON- head down and -PRON- eye avert 
zelda sit at -PRON- right be calmness -PRON- 
mr lorry where do -PRON- all come from i win der 
mrs brackett -PRON- mind flounder help lessly in a mire of undreamedof rich reach after -PRON- origin as a measure of relief 
that be something aunt sarah say zelda that -PRON- shall probably never know 
well anyway -PRON- have get a good right to the treasure bristle mrs brackett as though by -PRON- vehemence to quiet the still small voice of conscience 
when i think of -PRON- poor boy lyin back there on that rocky island i donot feel that there be enough money in this world to make up -PRON- loss to -PRON- get a right to -PRON- i know -PRON- have 
certainly -PRON- have affirm zelda 
-PRON- should not have be send for the treasure if -PRON- hadnot a right to -PRON- 
by jove chime in the thin voice of vande leur ours no matter where -PRON- come from have an idea i theorize that the treasure a a to be find somewhere on the island 
the very name of the island no doubt give to -PRON- by -PRON- relative would seem to point to that fact 
then again fortune island be of volcanic origin 
somewhere about -PRON- this molten metal may have be find 
i be not enough of a metallurgist to know whether a mine of silver and gold could exist in such a condition as -PRON- see these frag ment yet that be the only explanation i can offer 
in the absence of anything more definite rob ert say zelda -PRON- be the explanation -PRON- shall accept 
i be make custodian of the box by mrs brackett and zelda even vandeleur assent to the arrangement 
upon reach san fran cisco i be to turn the treasure into money and parcel -PRON- out in quarterly share 
a day or two later i have a talk with vande leur force -PRON- to a full and complete confes sion of -PRON- doubledealing 
-PRON- have hire the two beachcomber to lay for -PRON- the night i go to logy just as i have suppose 
when -PRON- report -PRON- failure to -PRON- on the same night the attack be make -PRON- like a a ter to four wise bring the news that i have go to logy bill to secure -PRON- help in put -PRON- on the track of a reliable skipper 
vandeleur know of captain golden through captain trent 
arm with the information bring by the hire footpad vandeleur call on captain golden tell -PRON- some of the fact in the case and suggest that -PRON- approach logy bill in a cautious way and see if bill would not refer -PRON- to -PRON- 
that be exactly what happen 
all -PRON- subse quent trouble be due to logy failure to make sure of -PRON- man 
as soon as -PRON- become certain that captain gold en be to take -PRON- expedition seaward -PRON- and vandeleur begin to plan 
-PRON- finally decide that -PRON- would be good to wait until -PRON- destina tion be know then put -PRON- out of the way as a troublesome menace to the success of -PRON- scheme 
after the failure of the attempt to get -PRON- over board in the southeaster the ludicrous rivalry between the skipper and vandeleur for favor cause a coolness between the conspirator and i be let alone 
captain golden overheard a a to four zelda tell -PRON- that -PRON- object in make -PRON- self agreeable to the skipper and vandeleur be solely to insure -PRON- safety and the rival imme diately become reconcile and agree to continue -PRON- nefarious work 
the blow i have give the skipper on the beach of the lagoon inspire -PRON- to go ashore with vandeleur for the purpose of seek vengeance 
-PRON- discovery at the eastern end of the island follow and -PRON- believe -PRON- have do -PRON- bad when the rope be toss from the cliff 
return to the schooner golden order away the three boat and go to the cavern 
if i have be there vandeleur assure -PRON- i would never have leave the cavern alive 
golden and vandeleur positive that the cav ern have something to do with -PRON- secret mission to the island search -PRON- carefully and of course find the ten box 
when -PRON- weigh anchor and leave the island captain golden intend to make port somewhere in south america dispose of the schooner turn the treasure into negotiable fund divide with vandeleur and then -PRON- and vandeleur would lose -PRON- in distant part to enjoy -PRON- illgotten gain 
a a ter to four in make -PRON- confession vandeleur be very careful to shield -PRON- at the expense of the dead skipper 
vandeleur to take -PRON- word for -PRON- be always the one who be lead always the one who deprecate violent measure 
yet i know the part -PRON- have play as well as though -PRON- have tell -PRON- and -PRON- desire to shirk responsibili tie serve merely to increase -PRON- contempt for -PRON- 
-PRON- be more than a month get back to san francisco 
as soon as -PRON- have effect a landing a cab be call and mrs brackett and zelda proceed at once to -PRON- old lodging in kearney street 
i remain overnight in the schooner with stubb and on the follow morning hire a dray and accompany the ten case personally to the morgan smelting and refining company 
here the bullion be weigh and a receipt give -PRON- in the name of brackett anstruther vande leur and lorry 
two day afterward i call for -PRON- statement and check 
there be a ripple of excitement in the office of the smelting company when i pre a arter to four sente -PRON- and i be request to step into mr office for a private interview 
a spasm of doubt seize -PRON- and i begin to have vague fear for the outcome 
mr morgan be a stout man with sharp commercial eye 
-PRON- appearance i believe be respectable enough but i be very sure that i do not look like the honest custodian of the treasure deposit two day before 
mr morgan have a memoran dum of the bullion and a certify check before -PRON- 
-PRON- will pardon -PRON- for make some in quirie i trust say -PRON- but the large amount of gold and silver which -PRON- leave with -PRON- and the peculiar condition in which -PRON- find -PRON- impel -PRON- to ask -PRON- a few question mr lorry shall be glad to give -PRON- any information -PRON- may desire i answer 
could -PRON- send for the other party who be interested with -PRON- in this matter 
certainly if -PRON- wish -PRON- 
a boy be send out to secure a cab and pro ceed to the house in kearney street with a note for zelda 
in half an hour the cab have return a a ter to and mrs brackett zelda and vandeleur be with -PRON- in mr office 
during -PRON- wait for -PRON- three companion i have ample time to observe the suspicion with which mr morgan regard -PRON- and when zelda and mrs brackett enter i see the suspicion slowly leave -PRON- face 
have -PRON- any objection to tell -PRON- where this large amount of gold and silver come from inquire mr morgan 
i nod to zelda 
will -PRON- satisfy -PRON- curiosity miss an struther 
i ask 
tell -PRON- everything 
i have an idea that mr morgan look upon -PRON- as freebooter and for one should like to have -PRON- entirely satisfied 
zelda launch into the story forthwith be gin with the quartered card of instruction mention -PRON- interview with mr price and follow the narrative through to -PRON- landing in san francisco 
of course -PRON- mention only those matter that have to do with the treasure leave out all incidental matter 
mr morgan excuse -PRON- go into an other room and -PRON- could hear -PRON- call up mr 
a a ter to four price 
presently mr morgan return smile and perfectly satisfied 
-PRON- narrative miss anstruther say -PRON- resume -PRON- chair sound like a tale from the thousand and one night 
i wish to congratu late all of -PRON- and here -PRON- sweep the four of -PRON- with a comprehensive glance on -PRON- cour age in follow a very strange affair through to a successful and highly profitable conclusion find -PRON- continue consult the memo randum before -PRON- that mr lorry deposit with -PRON- for -PRON- joint account ounce of precious metal 
of this amount ounce be gold and ounce silver both of an exceed ingly high degree of fineness 
the gold amount to and the silver to make a total of for which i now hand mr lorry -PRON- certify check 
allow -PRON- to congratulate -PRON- again on -PRON- good fortune and to bid -PRON- a good morning 
-PRON- require zelda on one side and -PRON- on the other to support mrs brackett back to the wait cab 
-PRON- will have more than seventy thousand dollar for -PRON- share aunt sarah zelda have a a ter to four whisper and mrs brackett be continually mumble the amount over to -PRON- 
from the office of the smelting company -PRON- drive to the bank on which the certify check be draw 
there -PRON- write -PRON- name on the back of the check exchange -PRON- for four draft each for the sum of seventytwo thousand two hundred and five dollar and thirty cent 
-PRON- have still to reimburse mr lorry say zelda if each of -PRON- give -PRON- twelve hundred dollar sy send -PRON- -PRON- check say vandeleur airily 
this happen more than a year ago and van deleur check be still on the way 
dight break 
settlement for the use of the schooner be make with job golden a shipchandler and a brother of captain nathan 
no complaint be lodge against the hand 
-PRON- receive -PRON- wage from job golden together with a similar amount from -PRON- for i have promise -PRON- double pay shortly after leave fortune island 
with the consent of mrs brackett and zelda a bonus of one thousand dollar be give the mate and five hundred dollar each be give anderson and larsen as a gratuity 
have these three not serve -PRON- so well the entire treasure would probably have escape -PRON- 
the extra money come at a particularly oppor tune time for mr stubb inasmuch as job gold en be harass -PRON- with threat on the score of the dead skipper 
i suggest to mr stubb that -PRON- spend a little of -PRON- bonus for a lawyer service and send -PRON- to mr price 
mr price send the shipchandler a call to come a a ter to to -PRON- office 
when mr golden come -PRON- face a counterthreat for damage if -PRON- persist in malign mr stubb 
thereupon mr golden drop the matter 
mrs brackett do not remain long in san francisco after obtain -PRON- share of the trea ure 
at -PRON- urgent request zelda accompany -PRON- to emmetsburg for a visit of several week 
before zelda and mrs brackett leave i ask zelda the most momentous question of -PRON- life preface -PRON- with a brief account of -PRON- career as a soldier of fortune 
during -PRON- clash with van deleur in the cabin of the lady may at the time the envelope be open -PRON- have make a slur ring attack upon -PRON- character 
i want zelda to know everything before -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- an -PRON- smile as i offer -PRON- reason for go into the recital of -PRON- past 
that be entirely unnecessary robert say -PRON- 
when two person have be together so long and have face so many danger side by side as -PRON- have -PRON- come to know each other pretty well i think 
-PRON- answer dear 
i ask eagerly 
a a ter to four thought i give -PRON- to -PRON- week ago when -PRON- take that walk up the valley from the cliff to the cabin 
so -PRON- have but loverlike i feel that the sweet est story ever tell could not be tell too often even if -PRON- depth and intensity prove the despair of word 
so -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- answer again and while i be seal the compact with a kiss mrs brack ett come into the hotel parlorand stand aghast 
rosy and brighteyed zelda fly to -PRON- put -PRON- arm about -PRON- neck and tell -PRON- the secret -PRON- secret 
and poor mrs brackett avow that -PRON- have never dream of such a thing 
nothing would do then but that i should come to emmetsburg in the course of a month so that zelda and i may honor -PRON- home with -PRON- nup tial 
-PRON- will be clear of that mortgage by then -PRON- dear asserted mrs brackett and if there be anything in omen -PRON- and mr lorry will be bless with a good one 
san francisco seem dreary indeed after zel da have leave but i try to keep busy 
after nearly nine year of profitless roam i at last have a a to four money to invest and with mr help i be able to invest -PRON- safely and well 
i see nothing of vandeleur but i hear that -PRON- be to use a slang term fly high and burn the candle at both end in the attempt to get rid of -PRON- money 
after three week of san francisco i begin make preparation to leave for emmetsburg 
and then on the very morning of the day i have plan to start a hasty summon reach -PRON- from mr price 
i be to call at -PRON- office imme diately 
wonder what could be in the wind i hur rie to answer -PRON- request 
mr lorry say -PRON- after -PRON- be both com fortably seat in -PRON- private office be now at liberty to tell -PRON- more regard -PRON- recent highly successful expedition to fortune island 
at liberty 
i repeat bewilder 
exactly that 
i be bind by a promise up till this very morning 
not that i know anything worth while -PRON- put in hastily or anything which if tell would have help -PRON- materially in -PRON- work 
what i have to say be merely by way of explanation 
a a to ur several month ago i be send for by a pa tient in st hospital 
i find this pa tient to be a man who have be badly hurt and be slowly die from the effect of -PRON- injury 
-PRON- may live a week the doctor say or -PRON- may drag out a miserable existence for a year but -PRON- end be sure to come 
this man give -PRON- four seal unaddressed envelope together with eleven hundred dollar in cash 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that one hundred and fifty dollar of the money be to be -PRON- fee for do certain thing which -PRON- would stipulate 
the four envelope be to be give or for ward to four different people who live in various part of the country 
the address of two of those people be know and the ad dress of the other two be to be find 
the name the man give -PRON- be yours mrs miss and mr vande leur 
where mrs brackett and miss an struther be to be find -PRON- know 
-PRON- also know that vandeleur live somewhere in san francisco but of -PRON- whereabout -PRON- be en tirely ignorant 
vandeleur be easily discover and a letter a a ter to -PRON- to -PRON- uncle rufu in great barrington massachusett develop the fact that -PRON- be in chicago 
there be certain question to be answer by all of -PRON- in order that identity may be prove beyond all peradventure 
the man in the hospital have these question write out on separate sheet of paper together with the correct answer 
-PRON- impress -PRON- with the fact that fortune be wait somewhere in the pacific for the four whose name -PRON- have give -PRON- and that to find the whereabout of the fortune the content of all the envelope would be need 
-PRON- task be to see that the envelope reach the proper party 
-PRON- client suggest that i work through lawyer in various part of the country and i be to forward with each en velope the sum of two hundred and fifty dollar in cash 
out of this amount the several lawyer be to keep fee of fifty dollar each the re mainder be turn over to the person the law yer be to communicate with 
the fact that -PRON- client be in san francisco be to be keep a secret as well as be everything else except the detail that have to do with the a a to come together of the four and the beginning of -PRON- enterprise 
-PRON- client -PRON- be who offer the suggestion that the four make -PRON- know to each other by the mystical formula that concern the time of day 
this say -PRON- client will not only prick -PRON- curiosity when a bare statement of what -PRON- be to do may fail but -PRON- will also give -PRON- a fitting idea of the caution necessary to the success of -PRON- undertaking 
personally i think that -PRON- client be logical and entirely human nature be a queer thing mr lorry 
this client of mine be a good judge of human na ture and -PRON- have work out every detail of -PRON- plan while lie on -PRON- back in the hospital ward 
but this client of yours mr price i break in if -PRON- know of this treasure why do -PRON- allow -PRON- to go out of -PRON- hand 
as i have already say -PRON- have be bedridden for month and slowly die 
fate deny -PRON- an active part in seek the treasure and what good could the treasure do -PRON- when -PRON- doom be seal and merely a matter of week or month 
besides -PRON- assure -PRON- that -PRON- be a a ter to bind by a solemn promise a promise give to the dying 
what -PRON- hope to accomplish be the recovery of the treasure by those entitle to -PRON- and to so plan that not one of the four if so dis pose could take unfair advantage of the other 
mr price get up from -PRON- chair 
-PRON- now understand the preliminary detail mr lorry say -PRON- and if -PRON- will accompany -PRON- to the hospital -PRON- will learn whatever else be necessary to make the whole matter clear 
i be now at the end of the mystery and i have discover that the end of -PRON- do not lie in faraway fortune island but right there in san francisco 
mr price have a carriage wait at the curb 
-PRON- enter -PRON- and be soon at st hospital 
an attendant who have seemingly be ap prise of -PRON- intend visit meet -PRON- in the office lead -PRON- to an elevator and to a private ward on the third floor 
-PRON- tap on the door and a whitecappe nurse answer the summon 
mr lorry i hear the attendant whisper to the nurse 
in a moment the latter answer and go back into the room 
a a ter to four presently the nurse return 
-PRON- wish to see mr lorry alone say -PRON- 
just go right in sir -PRON- add to -PRON- 
thrill with all this mystery supposedly sur round the clearing of the great puzzle 
i pass into the white highwalled room 
the door close behind -PRON- 
on a white iron bed in the center of the room lie a man whose thin face be like chalk and whose black burn eye seem abnormally large 
a slight smile cross the cadaverous face and give a ghastly twist to the bloodless lip 
a clawlike hand be lift and hold toward -PRON- 
bob exclaim a weak voice 
i stare step forward and grasp the cold hand and stare again 
arthur 
i exclaim 
arthur mayhew 
a lift veil didnot think -PRON- would know -PRON- old chap say a bit changed since -PRON- see -PRON- last 
draw up a chair by the bed 
-PRON- voice isnot any too strong and get a lot to say 
vividly impress by the difference between the roister harumscarum lad i have know year ago and the wreck that now lie before -PRON- i pull a chair close and sit down 
for a few moment arthur lay quiet staring at -PRON- intently 
-PRON- mother and mine be sister bob -PRON- murmur and if -PRON- have not die so soon per hap -PRON- and i would have be different 
who know 
i never be so bad as -PRON- uncle rufu choose to think -PRON- -PRON- add with another of -PRON- ghastly smile so when i couple -PRON- lot in life with -PRON- own -PRON- be not in an evil way 
soldier of fortune 
-PRON- smile become a husky laugh be die early donot -PRON- think 
perhaps -PRON- isnot so bad as all that be halfdead alreadyfrom -PRON- waist down 
a arter to four in a few day the doctor say -PRON- heart will be involve 
unknown 
i shall pass into the undiscovered country with a well con science now that i know a solemn promise have be fulfil and that i have be the mean of bring wealth to four who deserve and be en title to -PRON- 
-PRON- pause 
hand -PRON- a glass of water bob -PRON- say abruptly 
-PRON- throat be as dry as a bone 
i give -PRON- the water and -PRON- rest for a min ute 
-PRON- do the business all right -PRON- smile 
price tell -PRON- 
how much do -PRON- weigh out 
i tell -PRON- 
good -PRON- exclaim be able to bring a little with -PRON- when i leave the islandenough to see -PRON- through this hospital experience and to hand around something for lawyer fee and to give -PRON- four a limited amount for travel ex pense 
and i say bob 
what be -PRON- arthur 
-PRON- flame eye dance with a suggestion of -PRON- merry boyish twinkle 
what time be -PRON- -PRON- ask 
a a to four i look around for a clock and again -PRON- laugh huskily think -PRON- would tell -PRON- a quarter to four -PRON- go on 
have -PRON- so soon forget ten or didnot -PRON- make the impression on -PRON- i think -PRON- would 
certainly -PRON- impress -PRON- strongly enough 
but why didnot -PRON- have -PRON- come right here and tell -PRON- the whole business 
that would have be the sensible way to get at the thing ar thur 
-PRON- donot understand bob -PRON- answer ear nestly be bind by a promise 
i could not even seem to give -PRON- an advantage over the other four 
but -PRON- know i be hone tush boy 
of course i know -PRON- be honest 
to tell the truth i didnot want to talk with -PRON- before -PRON- cross the water for that treasure 
i be afraid -PRON- would find out too much about -PRON- -PRON- have such a keen way with -PRON- and would not go after -PRON- 
i start as though sting the treasure honestly come by 
i de mande 
a a to four -PRON- three dead comrade be lie in fortune island say -PRON- give -PRON- a steady look 
be fore i close -PRON- eye i promise each one of -PRON- that the person -PRON- name should have a rightful share in the treasure 
when man die -PRON- try to go with clear conscience even as i be try 
be -PRON- likely bob that -PRON- and i would want -PRON- to go after treasure that be not honestly come by 
the point hinge on -PRON- personal interpreta tion of right and wrong 
i know that i be right and -PRON- must acknowledge that -PRON- feel in the same way before -PRON- leave this room or i shall die plague with the thought that i have be a curse instead of a benefit to -PRON- 
go on arthur i urge strangely thrilled think -PRON- get that silver and gold from somewhere about the island 
-PRON- didnot -PRON- burst out vehemently 
-PRON- come from the mint at tientsin 
from the mint at tientsin 
i gasp 
by fortune of war arthur resume still ve hemently 
be -PRON- a soldier of fortune that -PRON- should balk at what come to -PRON- by fortune of war

-PRON- pause suddenly ask for another drink and stare hard at -PRON- over the top of the glass 
what do -PRON- think of -PRON- bob -PRON- ask hand the glass back donot know what to think arthur say i gloomily look for a surprise but not for anything like this havenot a hairtrigger conscience as -PRON- call -PRON- arthur proceed but i donot think any one can complain that i never try to do what s right give month of study to this thing study -PRON- from the point of right and wrong between man and between man and -PRON- maker and i decide long ago that the treasure be rightfully ours 
if -PRON- hadnot take -PRON- some one else would 
and where s the wrong of take a thing that s bind to be take anyway and from a people that didnot deserve to have -PRON- in the first place 
i remain silent 
well say arthur go on 
the gazelle a a to four sail for san francisco 
for week everything go well and then one night -PRON- try to sail across a reef and into an island that wasnot on the chart 
-PRON- be blow hard at the time and the brigantine go headon with a smash that break -PRON- down clear to the foremast 
the sailor in the be drown like rat in a trap and those on deck be wash overboard 
trent brackett anstruther and i be be low in the after cabin and -PRON- crawl up on deck as quick as -PRON- could and try to get a whaleboat into the water 
a wave stove -PRON- in against the side of the wreck and every one of -PRON- get hurt what s do the trick for -PRON- now bob 
i be hurt internally somehow and the trouble never take form until after i be pick off the island by a tramp sealer and have start for home 
-PRON- be a quartet of cripple after that and -PRON- be the hard kind of work get to land 
i be throw into the water and get ashore by swim trent and the other two follow in the dory 
-PRON- ere on the island two monthsthat be i a a to four be for -PRON- comrade begin to drop off the sec ond week after -PRON- land 
the first week though -PRON- all manage to do a fair amount of work 
anstruther have a broken arm wound have open up again so those two buckle in on shore while trent and i ferry back and orth between the beach and the wreck 
-PRON- bring away canned stuff and other pro vision and brackett and anstruther pick up wreckage on the beach and carry -PRON- to the val ley where -PRON- build -PRON- cabin 
-PRON- take the gal ley stove and the table from the cabin and but -PRON- have see the layout i guess so -PRON- will have a pretty fair idea of what four crippled man ac complished 
-PRON- hard job be get out those ten box 
man man but trent and i sweat blood when -PRON- do that 
trent have change the stuff from the ammunitioncase to the teakwood box at nagasaki 
somehow trent couldnot bear the look of those united state army am munitioncase 
-PRON- have find that cave while snoop around the island in the dory and trent think -PRON- would be safe to dump the box on the beach a a to four inside the cave then if any boat happen along and pick -PRON- up there wouldnot be any disagree able question ask 
if the rescuer look like a pretty decent white man -PRON- would trust -PRON- to help -PRON- get the box if -PRON- didnot -PRON- would leave the box where -PRON- be and come back after -PRON- 
so -PRON- labor like galleyslave get the treasure out of the wreck and into the dory and out of the dory and into the cave 
after that first week -PRON- all get together in the cabin -PRON- would build and the gloom have settle over -PRON- thick 
-PRON- hadnot a notion that any of -PRON- would ever live to get away but -PRON- each give information about -PRON- next of kin along with other needful detail and -PRON- be write down and solemn promise be make to do the right thing 
brackett poor chap be the first be alive today but for that bullet the boxer throw into -PRON- 
-PRON- hardship at the time the brigan tine be wreck open up the wound and -PRON- couldnot do anything 
-PRON- flicker out during the night and -PRON- find -PRON- cold and stiff next morning with -PRON- mother picture grip in -PRON- finger 
-PRON- bury -PRON- picture and all alongside the a a to four grave of some of the sailor -PRON- would pick up on the sand 
then i begin get out headboard and put in -PRON- spare time carve -PRON- 
gruesome work 
-PRON- be bad than that bob 
here -PRON- would be soldierin in the philip pine and china count the hour until -PRON- be to get back to country only to wind up on that miserable rock in the pacific and begin end e -PRON- day 
anstruther follow brackett 
nostalgiai think the doctor call itgot in -PRON- work and help -PRON- injury along 
-PRON- die during the third week 
trent be tough and -PRON- hang on longer than i have suppose be possible for any human be e hurt as -PRON- be 
-PRON- leave -PRON- in the sixth week and there i be all alone on the island manufacturing headboard 
trent before -PRON- die have take the island bearing and i have -PRON- down on a piece of paper along with the other information the rest of the lad have give -PRON- 
also i have some of the treasure in a dunnagebag i have take -PRON- out as a sort of sample and the survivor be to have a arter to four -PRON- for expense in start an expedition back to the island for the teakwood box 
-PRON- be a godsend for -PRON- that that tramp sealer put in at the island two week after trent die 
if -PRON- hadnot surely have go mad with the loneliness 
the captain of the sealer wasnot the sort of man i want to trust with the ten box so i didnot say anything to -PRON- about -PRON- 
later though when this paralysis begin creep over -PRON- i wish i have 
i may have take a chance on -PRON- i think just as -PRON- have take one on captain trent 
when the sealer reach frisco -PRON- have to send for an ambulance to get -PRON- to the hospital 
i consider -PRON- lucky to get back to the united state alive 
but month have slip away since then and here i be yet at that moment the door open and the nurse come in 
-PRON- be talk too long mr may hew say -PRON- decisively 
but i want to hear what bob do and mr lorry will have to put that off until to morrow 
a arter to four cometomorrow tell -PRON- what -PRON- think 
arthur be very weak and -PRON- be difficult for -PRON- to speak 
study -PRON- over tonight bob -PRON- add and tell -PRON- what -PRON- thinkwhen -PRON- cometomorrow 
conclusion 
loot 
loot from the pillaged city of tien tsin 
how that think rang in -PRON- brain as i walk away from the hospital 
and again and again -PRON- conscience ask what shall i do 
what be -PRON- right to do 
i think of what that treasure mean to mrs brackett widow and childless of what -PRON- mean to zelda and what to -PRON- 
i turn the problem over in -PRON- mind a thousand time and i could come to no decision 
if i halfdecide that -PRON- be right to keep the treasure then arise and grin mockingly in -PRON- face if i halfdecide that -PRON- be not right to keep -PRON- then face haunt -PRON- and fancy fly across league of heave pacific to a lonely island with four stark headboard and beside one of the mound mrs brackett be kneel and over another bent zelda anstruther 
a a to four i go to the hospital undecided 
i go away awe impressed sorrowful 
arthur be dead 
i have see the screen pull around -PRON- cot and the nurse have lead -PRON- behind -PRON- and i have stand hat in hand look down on -PRON- cousin calm untrouble face 
-PRON- last word be for -PRON- mr lorry say the nurse 
what be -PRON- 
i ask 
-PRON- be do not understand -PRON- but i presume -PRON- will be clear to -PRON- tell -PRON- cousin bob to keep what -PRON- have and say noth ing if not for -PRON- own sake then for the sake of the other 
-PRON- know what -PRON- mean mr lorry 
yes i answer huskily and turn away 
arthur have die fearless in the conviction that -PRON- be right for -PRON- to keep the treasure 
after i have lay arthur away i call upon mr price 
behind the closed door of -PRON- private room i repeat story as faithfully as memory would allow 
then i ask for -PRON- ad vice 
the lawyer light a cigar 
anstruther and -PRON- cousin arthur may a a ter to -PRON- hew say -PRON- as i think irrelevantly must have see some hard fighting in china suppose so say if there be any hard fighting and arthur could get in -PRON- there d be no hold -PRON- back 
but what have that to do with the question mr price 
-PRON- do not seem to hear -PRON- question 
and tom brackett -PRON- go on be badly wound and mention for bravery 
yes i answer grow more and more perplexed 
and -PRON- have an uncle kill in the uprising 
why yes but mr price wait a minute lorry -PRON- interrupt 
as near as i can figure -PRON- out china owe -PRON- and miss anstruther and mrs brackett something on account 
vandeleur -PRON- strike -PRON- be about the only one who s get something -PRON- s not en title tobut then -PRON- havenot any mean of know what captain trent do for or against the chinaman 
i can see by -PRON- face that -PRON- think this a specious argument lorry 
but i donot know 
-PRON- cousin last word to -PRON- seem to strike a tell note 
the lawyer puff at -PRON- cigar in silence for a a a to four few moment and then once more pick up the thread of -PRON- remark 
do -PRON- want to talk about this thing lorry and get mrs brackett so harrow up that shell return every stiver of -PRON- share to the boxer 
do -PRON- want some country skinflint to foreclose on that mortgage and turn the old lady out of house and home 
or on the other hand be -PRON- willing to tuck -PRON- sentiment in -PRON- pocket and let tom mother keep a roof over -PRON- head and live in peace and plenty all the rest of -PRON- day 
i be silent 
and miss anstruther continue mr price 
-PRON- have a young brother to look after hasnot -PRON- 
tell -PRON- what -PRON- know and i imagine archibald anstruther out there on that un charted island in the pacific would turn in -PRON- grave 
as for vandeleur how much talking do -PRON- think -PRON- would take to make -PRON- give up what -PRON- s get 
there be nothing i could say and i continue to sit quietly and wait for more light 
lean back in -PRON- chair mr price reflect deeply until -PRON- have smoke the cigar to -PRON- lip 
a arter to four then -PRON- toss aside the remain of -PRON- get up and stand before -PRON- appreciate -PRON- feeling in the matter mr lorry say -PRON- and -PRON- be infinitely to -PRON- credit 
i be sixty year old -PRON- boy and i con sider -PRON- a good american and i have try to be a just man always in spite of the fact that lawyer be popularly suppose sometimes to be pay for -PRON- principle 
-PRON- judgment be this the matter have pass from national to one of mere individual importance 
possession be nine point of the law and -PRON- have possession 
fol low the line of least resistance and peace go with -PRON- 
so i pocket -PRON- conscience and follow the line of least resistance but real substantial peace be never wholly mine until a few day ago 
a year pass and during all that time i have not breathe a word of story to any one except mr price and i have begin to feel that -PRON- be about time i make a confidante of mrs lorry 
so i tell -PRON- 
during that year -PRON- affair have prosper amazingly 
the oro group of mine in colo a a to four rado have develop into a second comstock lode 
by advice of mr price i have purchase half the stock of the oro company invest most of -PRON- own fund and the company have recently dispose of -PRON- hold ing to an english syndicate and -PRON- profit and be such as to make that entire fortune island treasure look very small indeed by com parison 
mrs lorry receive -PRON- account of the source of the island treasure with an equanimity that surprise -PRON- be glad that -PRON- tell -PRON- dear be all -PRON- say 
a week later -PRON- come to -PRON- and smilingly proffer a request for a check forewarn -PRON- at the same time that -PRON- be to be quite a large one and state that i be not to know the dis bursement of the fund 
how much be -PRON- for dear 
i ask whirl -PRON- chair around to -PRON- studytable open -PRON- checkbook and pick up a pen 
-PRON- lay a slip of paper on the table before -PRON- 
the amount pencil on the slip be 4io60 i drop the pen and fall back in -PRON- chair with a gasp 
a a to -PRON- -PRON- spare -PRON- dear 
zelda ask 
why of course butbut -PRON- put one arm about -PRON- neck and lay -PRON- soft cheek against mine 
then why donot -PRON- write -PRON- -PRON- ask 
i write -PRON- 
next day a thought come to -PRON- and i do a little figuring 
that island treasure have yield each of the four the sum of twice this amount give for a product the face of the check i have write for zelda 
what -PRON- do with the money i donot know but -PRON- conscience have be easy ever since
